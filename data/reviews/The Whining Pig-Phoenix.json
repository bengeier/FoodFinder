{"text":"I love this bar. It's cozy and because it's small it is an awesome place to meet other people in the neighborhood. A great place to go when you just want to feel \"home\"."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar! I have been in Phoenix for a year and a half and have been looking for a small friendly wine bar and I finally found it. The owner, his wife, and dad are so friendly and always remember everyone who comes in. It makes it so warm and inviting!  The wines are amazing. He has a huge variety and the happy hour is $5 wines till 8pm! The beer selection is huge too!  I love how they have games set up around the bar. One night I stayed for two hours playing Cards Against Humanity with people I randomly met at the bar, Did I mentioned how warm and welcoming everyone is here??  The cheese and meat platter is awesome too. It is huge and only $5.75. Such a great deal."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Kudos to Greg, the owner! Cheers! Great ambience and selection of wine and beer."}
{"text":"best new find in CenPho.  Great wine selection, good simple cheese/meat plate, crap parking but what else is new in this area?  Great hometown atmosphere, fun crowd, cheap drinks/eats, what more could you ask for! I will be back for sure and I am telling everyone about this fun place to hang in our hood :)"}
{"text":"Love it! It's really small but I hope they expand soon. Vast wine list and good beers to choose from. Wine and cheese plus petite desserts are yummy...hit the spot. Greg and his dad are uber cool. Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for beer and wine. Don't come on an empty stomach though as the food is limited. When you just want to chill and knock a few back, this is the place"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I went with some friends on a Saturday night after attending the Sriracha festival.  I've lived in Phoenix for 2 years now (and was in Tucson for 6 before that), and I had not been particularly impressed with any of the Phoenix bars that I had visited (Tucson has a better bar scene that Phoenix, hands down).  Too many try to be trendy (e.g., speakeasy-style places with surly hipster staff serving $12 old fashioneds and $7 beers); and most are just soulless, sad places to drink.  The Whining Pig truly stands out, and is my new favorite place in Phoenix.  The beer and wine selections were outstanding and varied, and very reasonably priced.  There were plenty of really good beers you've never heard of for $5.  I do like hard liquor, but I did not miss it at the Whistling Pig.  I was a bit tipsy, so I can't remember what beers I ordered, but I do remember liking them.  I also remembered getting a grilled cheese sandwich, which was delicious and about $4.  The crowd was great.  I made 2 new best friends just by chatting with some of the other people at the bar, and the bartender/owner, Clayton (not positive that was his name) was a great host.  The whole place just had a very positive, happy, friendly vibe, and it was crowded, but didn't feel overwhelming or oppressive.  Everyone was laughing and talking and playing board games and bullshitting.  Great atmosphere, ownership, and drinks.  Try it; you'll like it."}
{"text":"We had a great time trying new beers and wine while playing games we hadn't played in years. Great environment, large variety of beer and wine, and loved the happy hour prices! If we lived in AZ this would be a regular."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is how small it is. It forces you to interact with people and it creates a really fun inviting atmosphere!. Keep it up guys!! Also those brownies are fire"}
{"text":"My wife and are from out of town and had a great time. We will be back !!!!  Thank you"}
{"text":"NO DRAUGHTS for a \"craft beer\" joint?   It's all bottles and cans in a small hipster bar. Remarkably crowded with no aisles. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"For beer lovers and wine lovers too!  Groups of friends gathered for laughs and packed into the cozy (small) unique space with happy staff and smart companions; they all made room for two more.  We enjoyed a rich brownie designed to be shared and we stayed for hours, until I got hungry!  I would certainly make this place a habit."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have a great beer selection, however there were no beers on tap which knocked it down a star for me. The bartender was very attentive, super friendly and very knowledgeable of the beer selection. The one thing that I probably shouldn't hold against the them, but just could not get past was how extremely tiny the place is. I literally could barely fit in the seating on the right hand side of the bar. If you do not mind the close quarters I would say slap an extra star on this review. I will be back for sure but will definitely sit on the slightly more spacious left side of the bar."}
{"text":"Love this place! Reminds me of being in vacation, as you don't see many places like this in Az. The owner is super friendly and let's you try before making your selection. The bar is super small and cozy with fun trivia cards to test your knowledge. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Very cool place.  Fun games, good wine!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants to get off the beaten path and have some good old fashioned fun."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday evening around 6pm. Greeted by the bartender right away and very friendly! So many beers and wine it's awesome. Plenty of games to keep you entertained! Small place though. Parking is a challenge. Overall, a great place to grab drinks. Didn't try the food but maybe one day"}
{"text":"I would go 5 stars if food options were better and they had some draught beer too. Pretty much every review I have read on this place is right on the money, so I won't elaborate. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to The Whining Pig, and I am happy to say it will not be my last. This place is absolutely awesome. I found out about this place on Yelp, and every review that I read were five star.  The meat & cheese plate was very good. There were several different types of cheeses, wonderful sausage, bread, sliced granny smith apples with honey. A few nuts, cranberries, olives. And it was very reasonably priced. Their happy hour is from 3:00 to 8:00 craft beers $3 & wine $5 seven days a week, which is the best happy hour I have found thus far. Greg is not only the bartender is he also the owner. He is very knowledgeable about all the craft beer & wine that he serves. The selection of craft beer & wine is bigger than the establishment itself.  When I go back for my next visit I am going to try their wine selection. I am sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When we arrived it looked like there was no room.   The bartender waved us in and found a spot for myself and 2 friends. Super friendly people. Very knowledgeable about all their beers and wines. You tell them what you like and they make suggestions. Their grilled cheese is fantastic! They have a plethora of games. It is a wonderful atmosphere. My friends and I all agree this will be our new go to spot. Love key, good music, great prices.   Only downside is that parking is limited. We had to park across the street. Worth it though."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners. Great beer and wine specials. Unique neighborhood Bar. Awesome happy hour until 8. Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So many beer choices and awesome games. And the customer service hands down is the best I've had anywhere is a long time. And you can even get some of those tasty beers to go!!"}
{"text":"Frankly, I love everything about this place. When I'm at the Whining Pig, it seems like I'm somewhere besides Phoenix. Not to knock my own city, but there is something to be said for being in a truly urban environment where ducking into a bar means finding a seat and mingling by shear force of enclosed spaces. Tonight I watched a girl challenge anyone on the other side of the bar to a game of connect 4. It was cool, everyone considered playing and somebody accepted her challenge. Fun. Fun. Fun.   You have to give the owner, who you will see behind the bar at all times, lots of credit for appreciating and incorporating simplicity. Great beer. Great wine. Hungry? They will get their highly trained kitchen staff (owner's dad) putting together simple, tasty, filling and inexpensive dishes like a ham and cheese sandwich for I think $2.50 or better yet, try the plate filled with cheese, sausage, apple, honey, bread and crackers for under $10.  Maybe my favorite touch is the soap dispenser in the bathroom. Hilarious. Straight out of a country club bathroom with the sunscreen, etc.   All told, a welcome addition to a corner that has many bars, but lacked a whining pig."}
{"text":"Great bar!!  The perfect combo of selection, staff knowledge and price.  The place is small but get a spot and have a beer or 6!  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Went here because Vinepair.com rated this the best Wine Bar in Phoenix and we weren't disappointed!  It is small in physical size, but more than makes up for it in vibe and experience.  There are roughly 80-100 beers available in all different varieties from all over.  We went there for wine and found the wine list to have a great variety of both reds and whites.  This isn't the place to go get a $300 bottle to impress your friends, but for very reasonable prices ($6-$9 per glass on average) you will get wine that will definitely match your profile.  Clayton is an excellent bartender and listens to his customers to understand their preferences to get the best match.  There are an eclectic assortment of games (rock 'em sock 'em robots, go fish, cards against humanity, etc) for customers to play and the music selection always seemed to match the mood well.  Went there 3 times in one week and could hardly pull myself away each night.   Definitely worth a visit after work, on a date, or group outing!"}
{"text":"The best bar in Phoenix.  The smallest bar yes, but the most fun by far.  Everyone is very friendly and Greg has a great selection of beers and wine. My favorite place to go to hang out with old friends, and to make new ones."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both visits have been fantastic. An amazing beer selection, fun happy hours, and unique sandwiches. What's not to like? A  great local bar."}
{"text":"Really liked the bartenders but the meat and cheese plate is the worst food purchase I have ever made. You can't just put Ritz crackers, Snyders pretzels, and really thick deli slices of meat and cheese on the menu for $11. I suggest getting rid of the so called meat and cheese plate because calling it that is misleading to anyone who has had this type of dish at a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Talk about a new low key laid-back bar Grant  is the bartender his dad does the cooking Happy Hours always going on fun place to have quiet mellow conversations with your friends without the big crowd Come early because seating is limited  Dress code:  anything goes mostly Business casual"}
{"text":"Cool, small, (and I mean small!) unique, place.  The menu consists of a boatload (aka good selection) of beers and wines written on the chalk board.  This can make it a little difficult to figure out what you want at times, but the bartenders tend to know their stuff and can help you out with ordering.  They color code the beer based on broad styles as well.  Anyway, when this place is gets going it can be a real ball, you'll get to know the people next to you (if you want), can play a bunch of random games such as battleship with your fellow bar goers, and order some light appetizers if you so please.  There's no other bars quite like the Whining Pig, definitely a place to check out at least once to experience for yourself."}
{"text":"Love this place! Who wouldn't love a place where you can drink and play games? It is really small, so it can get a little loud. It is easy to meet other people though, because of the small space. They have a great selection of wine and beer. The owners also make yummy little treats and pass them around for free :)."}
{"text":"If you're going out to eat,  before you get there,  stop here get a glass or two of wine.  Small,  quaint,  great people leads to a good time."}
{"text":"I don't want to write a review that compliments this place because I live so close and i want to keep it a secret, but I have to...  hands down the best bar in Phx.  If you have a group....maybe not.  If you and a few friends want to have the best time in a small establishment in central phoenix,  go here.  Cozy, comfy, and friendly!   If you dont like to talk to friendly ppl, dont go.  If you like to sit and ppl watch, also not for you.  Otherwise grab the trivia cards or game in front of you and challenge the amazing person next to you for some fun/friendly recreation! (Feel free to challenge those who accompanied you to said games too)...   fake ppl need not apply (Scottsdale receives you fakes fairly well)."}
{"text":"Great place to get drunk! Super small so getting a seat at the bar is a must. Service is friendly and always on-top of almost empty glasses. Oh and the prices are very reasonable.."}
{"text":"This place was a complete waste of my time on a Friday night. Tiny and cramped my wife asks for a chocolate martini(not knowing it's beer and wine only). So the bartender gives her a chocolate beer(c'mon man a chocolate beer for a lady?), it sucked! Then I order a wine for her which was mediocre at best. When I go to pay for the tab, I figure, I'll be nice and pay for the beer which sucked but what the hell and the bartender never brings back my change. So, I overpaid for drinks I didn't enjoy, and over tipped because the guy didn't bring my change. Ya, that place was awesome...not!"}
{"text":"Love this place! tiny but worth it. also Clayton is awesome! Music is awesome most of the time and 5$ mystery wine is always nice."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting a friend in the area and she took me to the Whining Pig. What an awesome bar! The intimate setting and super friendly bartenders made the place so much fun.   If you are in the Phoenix area, a visit to the Whining Pig is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! It's very small and intimate, has a great selection of craft beer and wine, and the atmosphere is not one you could find elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came into this bar several months ago knowing quite a bit about craft beer, but not much about wine.  About a dozen trips later, I have increased my craft beer knowledge and know more about wine than I ever would have frequenting another wine bar.  Greg is a fantastic owner who truly cares for his customers, and it shows.  Excellent prices, long happy hour, and a constantly rotating selection of high-quality wine and craft beer have made this location my favorite location in the state, bar none.    Do they offer a limited food selection?  Yes.  Can it get crowded?  Yes.  Is it worth pushing outside your comfort zone and getting to know someone new? Absolutely.  At the end of the day, this place is a bar, and the best one in the city without question.    If I had the time and a liver fortuitous enough to be here every night, I would."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place. Will you guys move to a bigger space? I'd give you 10 stars then!"}
{"text":"Totally amazing fun place!! Clayton and John are Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"What a cool concept and perfect complement to the 16th street/bethany area. A tiny bar with interesting decor, lots of really great beer and wine, reasonable prices, and a friendly and enthusiastic bartender/owner.   The place was packed when we arrived on a Saturday night but managed to find a table by the door. Eventually some other people left so we were able to snag a couple more seats for our friends. The WP manages to balance the small quarters so that even when it's full it felt cozy, not cramped or uncomfortable. It felt like you were in somebody's really cool private home bar and Greg (the owner) and other patrons made it a very welcoming atmosphere. We had a couple drinks and were able to talk amongst ourselves when we wanted and chat with the other patrons at other points. All that to say that the WP has a natural, comfortable feel.  The chalkboard displays a huge variety of beer and wine. Don't be intimidated. Just pick a random one if you're adventurous. Or ask Greg, he's happy to make suggestions. Also, the snacks and desserts are really good. Our friends had a brownie and I had a bite, very tasty. And then we got a couple ham and cheese sandwiches with this really great ham from Schreiner's. You probably wouldn't want to go here for dinner because it's really just finger foods (and there are lots of good restaurants nearby), but it's all so good it wouldn't be the worst thing if you pigged out (see what I did there?!) on some ham&cheese sandwiches, cheese plates and baked goods.   In sum, it's a great little place to come have a drink with friends. And you can easily stay here and enjoy all night, but at the same time you have lots of great restaurant and bar options within easy walking distance. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour until 8pm and huge selection of wine and craft beers.  Limited seating so get here early!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The beer and wine selection cannot be beat. The owners/employees are so down to earth. I wouldn't change a thing about this place. The grilled cheeses are so good!"}
{"text":"Went to this bar for the first time this week for after work drinks. This is a great little spot! The selection is fabulous for both beer and wine! It is small and cozy with little games on the bar for fun. You can even bring your own chalk for the wall!   The only downside is that it gets crowded and loud...but what's a bar without a crowd?"}
{"text":"Good bar, tiny! I did like the selection!  The only thing that took away from it were the people on an obviously bad first date sitting next to us. Not the bar's fault..."}
{"text":"It took me 30 minutes to set up this yelp account, but well worth the time. The whining pig is what Phoenix needs. A speakeasy where the local crowd can take the edge off and socialize in complete leisure.   Thank you Greg for this fine venue...we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best wines and beers and coastemer service ever I'm coming back for sure oh by the way happy hour is the bumb here check it out u won't regret it u like beer and wine come here"}
{"text":"Just walked out. We went in and sat at the counter directly in front of the woman bartender. She never acknowledged us. We waited a few minutes, giving her time to finish what she was doing. At this point another couple entered and were immediately greeted and served.  We continued to sit, figuring we get served. Wrong!!!  In fact two others came in, were greeted and served. A second server came in and began assisting others, walking by us several times. We decided to leave and as we did the female bartender said, \"Thanks for coming in\". Serious lack of customer service. Went around the corner to The Vig. Excellent"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with board and card games. Staff was friendly and made great recommendations for drinks. Beer menu was different both times I've been and they had plenty of options to either stick with local favorites or try something new. As far as food goes, the brownies are definitely worth the trip on their own."}
{"text":"A great selection of craft beers and fine wines. Incredible friendly service. Wonderful meat and cheese plate. This place is beyond description. One cannot categorize this joint. You just need to experience the pig for yourself."}
{"text":"The Whining Pig is amazing! The bartenders are friendly, funny, and give really good suggestions.  You're in luck if you have the good fortune to be there when Liz is bartending. She is the kitties titties. My husband and I have found our favorite beers here. Also, their grilled cheese is the bomb. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"We wanted to go as a group for happy hour, due to the phenomenal reviews on yelp.  We showed up with 6 people, walked in and were all shocked.  This place is super small.  Tiny, in fact.   In total I would be surprised if it sat more than 20 people.    Additionally, due to the small size of the place, it was incredibly loud.  Needless to say, we couldn't stay to experience the food and drinks, because there was just no room for us.    This would be a place to go at an odd hour, by yourself or with one other person max.  It's much too small for groups, and parking is confusing and/or unavailable for more than one car."}
{"text":"Favorite bar! Always up to try new places and venture out of comfort zone and this was definitely the gem to find. Tender was nice, atmosphere was fun, and throw back board games while enjoying happy hour? Sold. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"We stopped by to use our Groupon and fell in love with the place. Greg, the owner, was very friendly and made us feel instantly at home. His selection is unmatched and the brownies are the best I've had in the Valley. Great place for a mellow ending to your evening or to catch a quiet drink after work!  Five stars. Well done!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. No really, it's kind of hard to find... But very worth it. Great wine list and amazing beer selection. And fantastic happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hassle.  Too small and crowded for my group of friends to be able to chat or even sit next to each other.  Not nearly as large a selection as I expected for a wine bar - it seemed like they had one Riesling, no Moscato, maybe only one or two of most varieties."}
{"text":"Great music, fun crowd and awesome service! Outside a fooler. Unique; a must \"go to\"."}
{"text":"Best wine bar in town! Super busy during happy hour but still the friendliest place to be! Great selection of wine and lots of beer."}
{"text":"What a great find! Found this gem in the New Times. $0.99 wine tasting on Saturdays and craft beer on Sundays. Greg was amazing at choosing the right sip. They also carry rotating craft beer and hubby found a new Wee Heavy that we both enjoyed. We were there on a Saturday quiet but nice vibe. Happy hour $3 craft beers and $5 glasses of wine. Happy hour all day Saturday until 7."}
{"text":"Brit the bartender was nothing less than fabulous. The games,drinks and atmosphere were perfect. Third time here. The location is misleading. This is a popping place great for any generation that had a fun childhood. Please come in and enjoy your evening. The staff is wonderful but once again if Brit is there your night will be nothing short of perfect"}
{"text":"A great place! Small and comfy, you will go here and end up in conversation with new people all the time. The staff is great, very friendly, knowledgable, helpful, and fun. The beer selection is strong, as they had about 50+ from which to select. All beers are canned or bottled. Seems to have a good wine selection too, but I don't know jack squat about wine. Food is limited to five grilled cheese choices, and that's fine. Very unique selections and combos, and all priced reasonably. Go on a Monday or Tuesday, and they're only $2! Also has a longer happy hour than most other places... I think until 8pm? Definitely make a stop here."}
{"text":"This is an amazingly fun place, great job guys! The wine selection and knowledge of those wines makes it even better. Grilled ham and cheese is the bomb!"}
{"text":"We're biking over for happy hour tonight, so with looking forward to it all day I figured it was finally time to write the WP a review!   Greg, owner/bartender, is extremely knowledgeable about everything on the beer and wine list. He is always in a good mood, dancing around, offering chocolate around the bar, and making conversation. Even with a packed bar he will be in front of you ready for an order if your glass is even close to empty. We've found several new favorites thanks to his recommendations.  We are big beer people (Sam is a serious homebrewer) and the selection of good brews here is just absurd. What is even more absurd is the happy hour - EVERY day until 8pm?! Tack on the delicious cheese plate and damn.  This is a perfect neighborhood bar unique in its small size and friendly atmosphere. The old board games and boxes of trivial pursuit cards are a bonus. Where else do you get to drink Bells Hopslam and school your friends in Let's Go Fishin? I share the sentiment of wanting to give WP one star just to leave more room for ourselves, but obviously couldn't do that with a business that is doing everything right. Pretty sure our home value went up just being near this place. Keep up the good work, Greg!"}
{"text":"Great bar with a great selection! Small place but its cozy. Cool atmosphere. If your in town and want to check out something that's cool and local, I would say this is for sure a place to stop in at."}
{"text":"Lots of different beers! You will find one you like or try something new! The environment is chill and good for socializing."}
{"text":"Small, but tons of fun! unremarkable strip center with an unremarkable facade. However, what lies inside is quite good. A small place almost completely consumed by the bar itself.   Large selection of beer and wine. We sat near the front window. Chatted it up with a bunch of other patrons. You can't help not talking to people. Just a fantastic vibe in the place. Every so often a classic comes on the stereo and the whole bar starts singing along. Join in and have some fun. Try your hand at Rock'm/Sock'm Robots as well.   N*joy...."}
{"text":"The most fun, awesome place ever !! This one is a tiny place, but has so much character ! It is filled with fun games and cute little toys around. Drinks are amazing, bartenders are very attentive, welcoming and superb! Definitely going back here again :)"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks back. There is a reason they have 5 stars. I don't see a need to stop giving them that now. Next time I'm in Phoenix this will be one of my first stops. This Sam guy that has the top spot knows what he is talking about with this place. The bar tender was able to provide a beer that was amazing for every taste that my group needed/wanted."}
{"text":"This place is amazing if you're looking for a fun new drinking spot. Clayton will help you find the perfect drink and if you sweet talk him he might even play you a song on the guitar. I will definitely be going back! Amazing wine/beer selection and great happy hour deals! Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Charming establishment! Amazing they have so many options in such a small bar...and the Happy Hour, WOW! 3-8pm everyday! Good tunes, great service and delicious grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and there are great beer choices.  I'd suggest you try something out of your comfort zone and go with a good belgian.  We've tried them and now are hooked !We always have fun at the Pig ! Go for HH and choose wines and beer from the board.  Also be sure to indulge in one of their grilled cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Especially the BBQ Zin, fun 80s games, unexpected pizza delivery and the awesome dancing bartender! Very SF-like vibe right here in Phoenix. Can't wait to go back and meet more locals."}
{"text":"OMG !!!!  This place is the bomb if you like craft beer and beyond...Clayton is the man, as well as Garrett..best happy hour as it lasts past 6 - great value and personal attention to your taste!!!"}
{"text":"Nice comfortable neighborhood spot with a good variety of wines & beer. The meatb& cheese plate is also very tasty at a good prices"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I've stopped in many times, and it's always great!  First off, it's small and chill.  The walls are chalkboards, with all of their beer and wine selections listed for patrons to check out.  They have happy hour until 8pm, yes please.  They have tons of fun little games around the bar to play, including Cards Against Humanity.  The owners are great people, super down to earth...they play great tunes (which they usually are dancing to behind the bar).    They have a great beer selection (try Shake Chocolate Porter!!), which I swoon over every time I stop in.  They have a decent wine list and a few swine eats (hot dogs, ham and cheese sammich and a meat and cheese board).  It's the perfect neighborhood bar, no frills and laid back enough that anyone can just roll in.  My co-workers and I stop in pretty regularly, and my most favorite time was Valentine's night where they had condoms on the bar for people to take.     The Whining Pig: where people can drink and get it on responsibly."}
{"text":"I cant believe I haven't reviewed the Pig yet... This is a fantastic little bar. They serve only beer and wine which is fine with me. There are plenty of games to keep you occupied and they are a great way to make new friends as well. Happy hour is all day on Sunday with a huge selection of $5 wine and $3 beer. The meat and cheese plate is good. I love the Shriner's sausage they use. That being said do not come here for a meal as the options are VERY limited.  This is a place for drinking. *Park in the back...it is much easier to get out when you finally decide to leave."}
{"text":"This issue 5 star place you should try it. The wine selection and prices were great! Clayton the bartender was attentive and fun. The gourmet grilled cheese sandwich was fantastic..."}
{"text":"The selection is great! Very small and not for the claustrophobic, but definitely for someone who doesn't mind cozying up for a drink at the bar. Went in here with my mom for the first time, and the gentleman behind the bar (owner) was very knowledgeable in steering us in the right direction. Awesome happy hour until 8 and some yummy munchies for a meat and cheese plate. If you want to \"get into beer,\" or already are...go here."}
{"text":"A fun bar & great little spot for beer lovers! Staff is \"welcoming\" & that is so much better than just being \"friendly\"! They have some delicious and affordable Grilled Cheese(don't roll your eyes  these are made with stuff like goat cheese and fig or sun-dried tomato and mozzarella) $2 off ALL DRAFT BEERS at happy hour! Bring some friends and grab one of several boxes of trivial pursuit, or play with some wrestling action figures... like you played with as a kid or the battery powered fishing game you won't be bored, if you are...well, maybe you're just boring."}
{"text":"Cozy, vintage, and amazing. There are 30,000 pennies in the bar top. Bartender is very friendly and knowledgeable about different wines. Wine pours come in beakers!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know what all the other reviews say on this place. Been here twice and both times it's so packed and really noisy. Really crammed place, and not the best situation to kick back and enjoy beer leisurely. So YMMV depending on what kind of place you like to drink at.  So why the 3 star? No draft beer. That's just craziness to me. First time I've heard of a craft beer bar that doesn't serve draft beer. I'm not going to go into why there's a higher chance of getting fresher beer from a keg than a bottle or can, but there is. And I can't go out and buy 5 kegs of beer to try 5 types of beer (well I could but that's not practical). Guess what, I can go buy 5 cans/bottles of beer and try them so why should I go to a bar and pay extra for something I can do at home? Yep, I won't. I'm not coming back and my initial response is to 2 star this place but I'll give it the benefit that everything is cool with this place."}
{"text":"This place is not like your usually bar! The atmosphere is good and the customer service is one of the best! They have games around all the seats to entertain you and your guests! I went for the wine and wasn't disappointed! The bartender helped my friend and I with picking out some great choices! Plus you can't beat the prices! I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I happen to stumble on this fun little bar this past Saturday night after having dinner down the street. First, it's very small but we did not let that stop us from checking it out. Glad we did! From the moment we stepped in the other patrons and bartenders (Bleu & Sam) where friendly. Bleu immediately asked what we liked and told him we never been here and gave him some ideas of what we might like. He offered up a great red wine and nice beer for us. From there we chatted with a few regulars and had a great time laughing. The bartenders interacted with everyone and made us feel welcomed! Bleu was on top of our drinks making sure we were taken care of all night. This bar is a gem. Husband and I can't wait to come back!  Thanks for making our 11 year Anniversary a fun night for us"}
{"text":"It's a wine bar...wait...it's a beer bar...no, it's both! An excellent selection of both beer and wine with excellent service to boot. If you're in the neighborhood stop in and quench your thirst.   As mentioned before they have a very generous happy hour... not so much an hour as a day (until 8p) daily.  As a bonus, they named the restroom \"The Jim\". So if you need a workout you can always say you went to the Jim (gym)!"}
{"text":"This place is quite amazing. It counters the chains by being small and personable. The downside I guess is that it is small. Very small. You squeeze in at the bar and if someone passes behind you, it will not go unnoticed. The beers theat they offer is written on the wall, but I had hoped that they also would have a printout. Then again, if you dont want to read through all your options - just ask the man at the bar and he will hook you up with something interesting.  This place is hard to describe, but they have found their niche. Read the other reviews. Better yet, just check it out for yourself. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Cozy, fun, not too loud. A very friendly and knowledgeable barkeep who could identify and critique each beer and wine. Literally dozens of beers and wines for the picking. Happy hour was especially enjoyable with $3 beers And $5 wines. Great find!"}
{"text":"Yay!  A place that offers happy hour on Saturdays until 8:00! You can't beat $5 glasses of great wine at this tiny place. We stopped in for a drink on our way to dinner, and ended up staying a couple of hours. If you dislike crowds, this is not the place for you, as it was packed the entire time we were there. The secret it out!"}
{"text":"Nice small place with a great collection of beers. The meat and cheese plate is a must have and check with the friendly bar tender if ur confused on what to order. Good place for a date"}
{"text":"Amazing little nook.  A huge variety of craft beers and wine with knowledgeable staff.  Play some classic board games, meet fun people, and drink good wine.  Definitely highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like this spot, super chill, tons of beer choices. I didn't try the cheese plate or the grilled cheese cuz I jus ate but I really want too. we tried the Big A Double A beer  it was citrusy and crisp....me likey and I'm not a huge IPA fan but it didn't taste all marijuanayyyyy. I love the free brownie Yelp check in good promotion and its bomblicious, hope it goes all to my booty... bam! . I frikn love peanut butter, thanks for the hook up. yah likes all day oh and I learned how to play Mancala and I rule and they play Gnarls Barkley, pink Floyd, & Smashing Pumpkins so I'm in anytime I need to get away from the downtown scenesters or newly college kids. yucks!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a Gem! It's small, dont get me wrong, but its very comfortable. It attracts nice people and the owner Greg is a good guy"}
{"text":"Found this gem through Yelp while visiting Pheonix for spring training and boy was it fantastic! The manager Garrett is incredibly knowledgeable about their beer selection and narrowed down my indecisiveness by learning a little about my taste. From the look of him, he probably chopped the trees down and built the place on his own!! Two thumbs up and we'll definitely by coming back!"}
{"text":"Shhhhh Stop telling people about this place so we can keep it a secret! This is a great little place with really resonable drinks. The owner was tending bar and was very nice. He gave me a taste of the wine I asked for before pouring the glass and the prices were very reasonable. They have a huge selection of wines and craft beers. I love the atmosphere as well. It is not like anything else around. Lots of fun bar games, good company, good bartender, great prices!"}
{"text":"It's a very small place and you cannot choose your bartender so your stuck with what you got, can you say I'm not going to serve you any ruder. I came for the happy hour since it's the only one that keeps a special on beer/wine until 8 p.m but it was NOT a friendly experience so I just walked down the way to hopefully a friendlier environment."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place. Awesome happy hour prices (and length: 3-8; Sun All Day). Didn't try the food (I think they have some), but it seems mostly geared to the wine and craft beer. And I loved the craft beer selection. Social games available to play for free (Trivia Pursuit, Cards Against Humanity, Connect 4, etc.). We came on a Friday and it does get crowded and loud, so just know what you're getting into. I definitely want to come in on an off day when I'm sure it's a bit more chill."}
{"text":"This tiny little bar is located on Bethany Home at 16th Street right around the corner from TexAz Grill and its a great addition to the neighborhood. The Whining Pig specializes in wine and craft beer and while its a tiny place, it has a great selection of beverages, homemade desserts, friendly staff, and a great selection of trivia and board games. Apparently they do a trivia challenge one night a week, where one side of the bar competes against the other.  If you're looking for a nice friendly casual place to get a drink and have some fun, check out The Whining Pig."}
{"text":"Small, Quaint place.  Great service; she did it on her own!  Good music.  Good drinks.  Good food and games! Neighborhood crowd.  Pro: hot dog stand on the corner.  Con: not good for groups."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! We are regulars :) we love Greg, the atmosphere and happy hour wine selection are phenomenal!! You won't find a better neighborhood intimate bar. The patrons really add to the positive and fun vibe.  A gotta must try Phoenix bar!!!"}
{"text":"Small. Family-owned. Stocked w/ great craft beers and good wines. Fun 80s games that let you either relive your childhood or experience it without being as old! Oh, and Cards Against Humanity. 'Nuf said? Those are some of the elements that make The Whining Pig a success. But ultimately, it's the vibe that the owners have created in this closet-sized bar that make it what it is.  If you're looking for a romantic wine bar atmosphere, a bar to take a large group of people on a Fri/Sat night for a fun night out, a quiet getaway, this isn't it. But what it is is a place where it's impossible to not be happy or have fun. It's about finding a few spots at the bar and making friends with those next to you, or across the bar. It's about trying beers or wines you may not have heard of. And it's definitely about that local bar feeling that is rare to come by outside of the East Coast."}
{"text":"Great local bar, incredible selection of wines. This is my favorite bar in Arcadia if I am looking for a relaxed vibe to sit and chat with my friends or even a great place to get drinks after a date with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, specialty grilled cheese sandwiches, cute bartenders, board games, action figures; this place has everything to bring out both the adult and kid in you. Limited elbow room, but I think the tininess adds to the charm. Great little bar."}
{"text":"This space screams locally owned - BEST part about it! I was in last night, and many time before this, and just can't get enough of it. The owner Greg is very nice; and always remembers what kind of wine I like to drink. It's a nice added touch to the place! It's one of my favorite places to grab a drink!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I stopped in when they first opened and you could get a parking spot out front. Met the owner and talked for quite awhile about the bar, its concept, and the law. Great and careful selection of wines and craft beers written on the wall and good noshing.   Check it out for a different experience and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have a blast every time I come here. Great wine and beer selection, you can play all sorts of board games with your friends. There is a family vibe here, lots of heart, U-shaped bar and great tunes. Plus they have delicious homemade goodies! The staff will join in on your games and are more than willing to offer wine/beer selections."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and bartenders and from what I hear the beer selection is awesome. Unfortunately, I am a wine guy, Pinot Noir to be specific. I haven't convinced them to purchase a decent bottle yet . Once they do, my rating will change to a 5! Waiting patiently... Got it John?"}
{"text":"So much fun.  You meet so many interesting people.  Bartenders knowledgeable.  Games are fun, played this guy named Steve at connect four and he kicked my ass."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from the whining pig, and I went in this past weekend with a friend. Although super tiny, it's a fun and extremely friendly atmosphere. The staff and owners are really cool and inclusive. The menu is fantastic and the prices are awesome!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is so quaint, small (reminds me the of TV show \"Cheers\") and amazing selection of craft beer and wine. What I love most is the games. This place has a bunch of games you can play while you are hanging out, like Checkers, Operation, cards, etc..  and the music is great too. The only downfall is if you get there when it's too packed you won't get a seat or a game which sucks. But two honest thumbs up and you will love this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE this bar! I went to The Whining Pig while I was visiting a friend in Arizona and was not disappointed! I loved the atmosphere and was really impressed with the quick service. The bartenders were very knowledgable on beer and wine and the selection was great! I will definitely be coming back to this bar when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!  For such a little place, who would of think it would be so much fun!  Every time we go, we have a blast.   They have great selection of wine and beer. Did I mention a great selection of grilled cheeses that they have? They are absolutely delish. Order up people.   The atmosphere is always awesome. People that work there are extremely friendly and have great knowledge of their products. You are never ignored at this place. Even if you went all by yourself, you would feel like you are in a company of so many friends!  They have several fun games all around so you are never bored at this place. Also, take an advantage of chalk wall and leave your prints.   I forgot to mention that this place has been most yelped place in the entire USA! Yes, entire USA. You must check it out and believe me, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The wine selection is amazing and their grilled cheese is to die for! I'm already waiting to go back!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST dive bars in Phoenix. Period. It's small yet very personal. The bar tenders are attentive and very friendly. Great idea for a group party stop."}
{"text":"Free brownie with check-in & purchase of anything! ( the brownie was rich with peanut butter  and tons of chocolate, you won't regret each bite!   Happy hour is from 3-8pm daily!   You can rent the pig for your private events on Mondays!  $5.00 grill cheeses: fig,prosciutto & goat cheese (mouth watering)   American Swiss & cream cheese ( I didn't try it)   Smoked ham & American chess ( sounded great but didn't have room)   Pepperoni capicola, Italian cheese cherry peppers & siracha! (Amazing, it bites you back!)   The beer selection is unbelievable perfect sweet spot to take your special someone."}
{"text":"Great place. Great prices. Great beers and wines. And what everyone is saying is true, the place is tiny. But, at least to me, that's alright, it adds to the bar. It would be a different place if it were bigger. Instead what you have in the Whining Pig is a fun, cozy place where you can meet great people, drink great beer and feel at home. It's going to be hard for me to leave."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall.  Worth the trip and Clayton knows his stuff.    Stop in if you love beer!"}
{"text":"I love that happy hour doesn't end until 8 pm! It doesn't get any better than that.   It is a little bit small -- but as soon as you're situated in your spot at the bar, you won't even notice how small it is. They have so many drinks -- you won't run out of choices.   I love the bartender Oscar -- he remembered our order from the first time we visited! Love the vibe, perfect way to end your day after work!"}
{"text":"The Whining Pig really is a local gem. It's a very cozy place and I hope all these stellar reviews won't draw too much attention to overcrowd the place. Greg is great behind the counter. The drink selection is pretty impressive.  The prices, and their hours offered, are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Love this place. Trendy and always a great time. Beer and wine list is on the wall. Only beer and wine folk so no cocktails here.  A few small eat options too.   The reason I really love this place is the games. Guess who, trivia games, sock em robots, Nintendo. Its always a good time."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to an already great neighborhood. Stop in and see Greg and his dad Steve (who makes a great meat and cheese plate!) and this cozy wine bar. The wine and beer menu rotates, so you'll be sure to find something new every time."}
{"text":"This is on my top 3 bars to hang out! I love the vibe it's really chill. I love that it's unique and they have very good selection in wines. The only thing I wish is that they updated their games since they are kind of old but other than that this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"By far the best wine bar in Phoenix!!  The bar itself is small and space is very limited, but the atmosphere and vibe more than make up for its small size.  The wine list is always rotating and this place has some of the best craft beers anywhere.  The happy hour here is absolutely amazing and can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I have come to this cute little beer and wine bar a couple of times.  Last weekend I decided to take my friend there since she is new to town and enjoys drinking wine. The bartender we had was horrible.    We sat down and he was nice to us when we got there and got our drinks right away.  Then he never checked on us, never asked how are drinks were or asked how are day was.   All he was during was talking to a girl at the other side of the bar.  When we asked for water he just throw it at us. Since the bartender was so rude to us, decided to pay for our drinks and leave.     Hopefully next time we will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Cruised by on a friday night.  Parking can be a bit of a pain. Lucky for us the table near the door got free just as we arrived.  You see all types of individuals from corporate type to just hanging out plane jane.  A group of girls next to us got done playing with a game and they just pass it on to us.  The Place is real small however the ambiance is awesome everyone drunk, happy singing.  The beer selection is beyond my belief. Dont let the outside deceive you for such a little spot they sure know what they are doing.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Real interesting place.  A little nook in a retail center transpired into something great.  Another example of Phoenix ingenuity by its owner (a father and son combo).  Go in here and check this place out.  They have games sitting on the counter, tight seating (yes, the back row is a little tight, and stools could be a bit more comfortable - when they are I bump this up to a FIVE STAR), and have a chat with the bartender/owner.  He is a real friendly guy, and he knows his beers.  This is a good place if you want HIGH ENERGY and GOOD SPIRITS.  Swizzle is across the street and you can bounce from A to B and hit the \"mystery shot\" there.  Fun little corner and a job well done by its owners.  ALSO NOTE - They have the game OPERATION - the old seventies classic.  Ask the bartender for the \"free beer challenge.\"  There is one piece - (human organ, I forget which one) that if you get it out first time without making the light go off I believe you win a free beer.  My friend Dave and i tried.....but you guessed it, we ended up buying our beers!!! Hahahaha  Tell him Attorney Steve sent you, the business and real estate lawyer.  Have fun and FIND YOUR SIZZLE.  Attorney Steve, the Business & Real Estate Lawyer  http://www.attorneysteve.net"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has 5 stars. it is worth a zillion. Such a selection of great beer. The best part is that the bartender knew EVERYTHING about the beer. He was able to match tastes to what they carried and his picks were better then anything we had. I can't say this enough, this place is a must in Phoenix!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a fan, 10x better than any fox concept.  Greg is a great host, and it is such an inviting cozy place you have trouble believing it has only been around for weeks and not decades."}
{"text":"So unbelievably freaking loud inside we had to leave. We tried to shout our order to the bartender but he couldn't hear us. Too bad because their beer list looked nice."}
{"text":"There's really nothing I can add that hasn't already been shared in these reviews. Three of us went in on a Sunday evening. A couple glasses of wine, a couple of beers, a shared Schreiner's meat and cheese plate, and a (thanks, Yelp check in bonus!) peanut butter chocolate brownie that was so rich and dense and if I use more adjectives you'd think I was writing erotica!  We shared bar space with Rock-em Sock-em Robots, Gumby and Pokey and lots of laughs over asking each other Trivial Pursuit questions.  We chatted with Greg, the owner, about everything from wine to music (and his wife's revenge on his iPod) and absolutely enjoyed the experience.  It's definitely small and the vibe is more suited to NYC or SF - but I am so happy it's here! Happy hour specials are fantastic! ($5 wines and $3 beers) Greg is easy to engage in conversation and knows his product incredibly well!   I was quite impressed with how comfortable I was here - usually I feel more than a little under-dressed and under-class in a wine bar. This is a great neighborhood hangout that happens to have an amazing (and oft changing) selection of wine. Great way for me to learn more about the grapes without busting the budget or making me feel like a moron!  Welcome to the neighborhood - what a fantastic addition!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying that I like The Whining Pig's other locations, so I'm really disappointed by my experience at this one.  I came here with my girlfriend on a weekday night around maybe 9-ish. We didn't expect it to be super busy, but it was absolutely packed. It's a tiny bar, so it gets pretty noisy, and we didn't see any empty stools. We decided after walking in we'd rather go somewhere a little quieter and less hectic. Well, the bartender took great offense to our decision and screamed \"BYE\" like a banshee at us as we were walking out the door! I was incredulous - I honestly can't imagine what would prompt such a reaction."}
{"text":"Everything you've read and seen on Yelp about this place is pretty much spot on.  Tiny space.  An insane wine and beer selection.  And numerous ways to kill time while having a drink with your friends.  Steer clear if you're claustrophobic, but otherwise you're pretty much guaranteed to have a good time at this completely unpretentious neighborhood hangout.  I actually came with a group of 6 folks around 11pm on a Thursday night.  We hung out at a restaurant for a friends birthday earlier in the evening, but the birthday girl wanted to put a cap on the night at this place.  Its located just around the corner from TexAZ Grill on the northeast corner of 16th Street and Bethany Home Road.  When we got there it was pretty packed, but there was just enough space in the west corner of the bar.  The fire marshall would probably put capacity of this place at around 12, but somehow they manage to cram at least twice that many in there at a time.  Though it's a little shall we say \"cozy\", its still a fun and relaxed vibe.  There's all kinds of things in the room to assault your senses.  For some it's the bar itself which is lined with pennies.  For others it's the numerous toys and trinkets randomly placed everywhere (a little toy Gumby was right next to my bar stool).  But the clear standout here is the drink selection, which is listed on a massive chalkboard inside.  As massive as it is, they pretty much have to use the entire board in tiny letters just to list the full beer and wine repertoire.  I got a can of Lumberyard Red Ale from Flagstaff's Lumberyard Brewing while the rest of the crew got a variety of different IPAs.  In addition, the bar area was packed with numerous games to kill time with my friends.  We played some Uno and some Connect Four, and I'm pretty sure I saw Cards Against Humanity nearby.  Additionally there's a chalkboard that patrons are free to write on themselves (some of which, as you might imagine, is far from PG rated, but hilarious).  So yup, five stars all the way.  Spectacular beer and wine selection, fun atmosphere, and our bartender Greg was a super cool dude.  I couldn't even imagine how busy this place gets during the late afternoon to early evening hours, but our timing late on Thursday was just right.  Not much in the way of food here (save for a few snack items or a free brownie with your Yelp check in), but who cares?  When the booze selection is this good and you're having this much fun with your friends, what else do you need?"}
{"text":"Great spot! Good beer and wine selection, the small intimate atmosphere makes it a real neighborhood joint. Great happy spot or after dinner drinks!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time! Extensive wine list. And great local beers to taste. The owners are amazing some of the greatest people I meet since I moved here. Come out and enjoy yourself at the best wine place ever!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Huge beer selection.  Happy hour prices are legit.  This place has a cool atmosphere. Not too much room, but it's fine.  I am a regular here and will continue to be one.  Any rating less than 5 stars is misleading and nitpicky (yes, that is a word now)."}
{"text":"I guess the secret is out.  I was trying to keep this for myself, sorry.  We have been coming here a few times already.  We love the coziness of this place.  Greg and his dad Steve are awesome hosts.  By the way, we met them when we came here, so we didn't know them before.  It is amazing that you can get great wines for $5 during their HH, which goes all the way until 8p.m.  There is also an option of $9 glasses of wine, I might give them a try once I'm done with the $5 list.  If you like beer, they have a very large list for $3 during HH.  We always end up ordering the cheese and meat platter, which at $8.50 is a bargain.  The place reminds me of some of the bars in southern Spain, where the emphasis is on the drinks and hanging out with your friends.  We drive 25 miles each way to hang out there.  We have to flip a coin to decide who will be the designated driver that week, lol.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We chose this spot as we were leaving our diner & I saw it was one of my many bookmarks, so glad we did. As first we weren't too sure being as the place is probably the size of a very generous walk in closet, no joke I'm very serious. Please don't make that steer you away from here because it will not disappoint, it's very quaint & they even have retro games from the 80's & 90's lined along the 20 seater bar for you to play. Everyone is beyond friendly & you literally end up chatting it up with perfect strangers as if you've just reunited with some old high school buddy you ran into. There extensive beer & wine ONLY list is covering the whole wall on one side of the bar, if you're a wine or beer lover who doesn't mind much elbow room then this would be your cup of tea!! Then as for there food menu you can either chose from a small selection of panini's with ruffle chips or a meat & cheese board. We loved this spot so much that we actually came back a couple days later for their happy hour & tried their grilled cheese panini. Oh & but of course I can't forget to mention the very knowledgeable & memorable bartender Dan, he was so friendly & had great suggestions for some wine tastings. Can not wait to go back their now that we're officially Arizonians!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here and it's great! We tried to play Trivial Pursuit but I can't see those small damn cards so that was an epic fail. Say hi to Garrett and you can read a more in depth review that was posted by my boyfriend (Jeff S)! Go Dodgers!!"}
{"text":"Where has this bar been all of my life?  I absolutely love everything about it!  It is quaint, attracts really friendly people, plays great music, has amazingly nice bartenders, and has happy hour with an extensive $5 wine and $3 beer selection until 8pm...yes, you heard me correctly!  This neighborhood gem will continue to be popular, so getting a seat could be a real issue!  Check this place out...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot to enjoy Wine & Conversation. Love everything about this cozy bar. Entered as a stranger and left as a new friend to a few. Love this place! Cheers***"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite watering hole in town. I'm lucky enough to live in the neighborhood and whether it be a beer or two with a buddy, a family member, or a date (if she's cool), Whining Pig is always one of my first choices. The bar itself is tiny, they only serve beer & wine, and their food menu only includes 4 or 5 grilled cheese sandwiches... But everything they do, they do EXTREMELY well. As a self-described beer geek, I still have yet to find a better craft beer selection in town (oh, and I've been searching)...the grilled cheeses are delicious...and the bar's size creates a real laid back get-to-know-your-neighbor environment. Just a great vibe with great people. If I had to some up this local fav in one word, that one word would be: CHARACTER."}
{"text":"I love this adorable little wine bar nestled into this cute little strip mall!!! Blocks from my home, it was a beautiful stroll from my home to this quaint establishment. Very simple, the bartender was super friendly and the music REALLY set the scene. They even have fun card games and things to enjoy while you sit back and enjoy your Riesling. Keep in mind, this is a smaller place and seating is limited, so get here early! After chit-chatting with the bartender he recommended some places for me to go because I am new to this neighborhood, I can't wait to try them all! Thank you!!! I can't wait to come back!!! :)"}
{"text":"Food is limited and the place is pretty small. But there is a terrific selection of beers and a handful of wine. The bartenders are all very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Stratton is a badass. He knows his beer and he's funny af. Would definitely come back to this location for great drinks and conversation."}
{"text":"My new favorite bar! We were eating at the Texaz Grill & decided to come check it out one afternoon.  It's a super small bar with maybe 10-15 seats at the bar & then a few seats against the wall.  They have awesome little games like Connect 4, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em, Operation etc to play while throwing back a few.  The bartender was really sweet & since I'm not a beer drinker, she helped me pick out a beer to try. They really know their stuff! The bottles of beer & glasses of wine are $3 until 8pm, crazy awesome!   We really loved the vibe here, just a chill, no-frills place to enjoy some drinks, my kinda place.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The Whining Pig is a great neighborhood bar.  I've been in during quiet middle-of-the-week times, one NYE it was a pit stop, regular weekend nights; I've been in by myself, with a friend, and with a group.  No matter what, The Pig is always a great place to be.  Yes, the bar is small....that's not a secret and nobody tries to make it one.  The food is \"snacks\", that's not a secret either.  What you get here is a fun, accepting, interesting, and thirst quenching hidden gem. (I suppose it's not so hidden anymore but..)  The selection of beer is good, the wine is good; even the \"Daily Special\" doesn't disappoint. Bartenders can, and will help you pick something if you're feeling indecisive.  As far as the crowd... people will interact with you as much or as little as you like... I like that."}
{"text":"I don't want to write a review about this place, but I'm going to do it anyways...  The Whining Pig has become one of my favorite places in all the valley to grab a few drinks and run into fellow Phoenicians/Yelpers (Hi Sunny!). Greg and his father did a bang-up job establishing this little beaut into a place that looks like it's been a part of the neighborhood for decades. The bar is tiny, filled with friendly faces and laughter, has great drinks and prices, and it just plain ol' feels good to be wetting your whistle in there.   That said, keep in mind that this is a wine/beer bar, so don't come for cocktails. And, if you get hungry, know that you'll be able to get order some light bites and baked goods to munch on while you get ready for your next drink.  It's that simple. The Whining Pig is a neighborhood bar that feels like a neighborhood bar. Say hi if you see me in there during happy hour because it's highly likely."}
{"text":"I can walk there from my house. Greg (the owner) is always so friendly and helpful. Patrons are all fun, friendly and outgoing. If you were new to the Phoenix area or just visiting, this is a great place to have a few drinks, play some games and have some fun."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim and i loved it, Ive never been in a bar with such a home-y atmosphere. They play great music at a volume just loud enough for you to be able to hear the bartender Layton talking over it as he explains the great beer selection on the wall. The actual bar itself (thats made out of pennies) has games sprinkled upon its surface that just beg for social interaction amongst strangers. The business is small so I imagine it can get crowded but its size has something great to add to the atmosphere, very personable.  Overall this is a great bar and its a damn blessing that it resides in AZ, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I may now be a squealing pig because I have found THE gem for wines and craft beers in Phoenix! I have had this place bookmarked for so long on my 'must try' list on Yelp and just keep passing it by. This past week while out with my hard to meet up lately, husband, who conveniently works very near The Whining Pig, we decided.. let's finally try this place! At about 930pm on a Thursday night, this little tucked in place was packed.. AS in standing room only packed! That's always a good sign! We luckily were able to grab two places at the bar right in the eye view of the greatest bar tender I've met in a long time. Clay, immediately introduced himself to us ! NO bartender does that ! Especially when they are busy. The wines and beers are all listed on a giant black chalkboard on the opposing wall from us , but he asked us what we were into. I'm kind of a wine snob, so I'm into everything ! I chose a great priced 2011 Grand Bordeaux from the board and my love, always up for any craft brew, opted for the even better priced $4 White Bag Special; the idea is that whatever the bartender grabs, is what the white bag is! He ended up with a New Belgium 1554 Black Lager first and then a Maui Brewing Co. Doppleshot Doublebock. He had fun trying to taste and guess the beer and talk to Clay, the bartender, about what it may be. Fun! $4!! I thought I was in for a second glass and Clay asked if I liked a full bodied wine.. I do! He gave me a sample of a rare Cab from France, which I loved and attempted a glass of. But this was not our first stop of the evening, it was after a dinner out that had included wine.. and hence, a quarter glass in, I felt bad leaving it! There are great noshs like charcuterie boards here, grilled cheeses and desserts! Lots of games to interact with , if you would like all hanging around on the bar. I like it. It's hipster, trendy, has a great atmosphere with music; its small, it's cute and a locals hit! I love a great wine bar .. Scott loves a great beer place. Can't wait to come back and hang with Clay again ! Seriously, this guy never let our water or wine run dry! He was busy and it did not phase him a bit.. he interacted with everyone .. loved it ! Like I said .. a gem this place is!!"}
{"text":"Really impressive place!! We stopped in to check it out for a drink, and ended up staying for about three hours. The happy hour prices were very affordable and the choices were abundant! The owner/bartender is a really great guy! Great decor and atmosphere.  You can't really go wrong by checking out a place with this many five star reviews on Yelp. If for nothing else, you at least have to stop in and check out the dancing bartender!"}
{"text":"Very large list with great staff to walk you through the adventure. Like the movie Chocolate for beer. Very pleased. And they have games to play!!!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!  We came in because they serve KCCO beer (The Chive) but stayed because of the beer/wine list, the brownies and the service!  When we first walked the guys with me gave me the look of \"really, you're taking us to this tiny, little bar\" but as soon as they checked out the beer list on the wall, they were set. We laughed, played trivia pursuit and made new friends.   Like someone else said in their review, \"I almost don't want you to know about The Whining Pig, because I don't want it to blow up too fast.\" I agree. Seating is very limited in this place and there isn't a lot of room to move around.   Kudos to the owner, you did a great job and we will be back with friends sometime very soon!!"}
{"text":"Found a small crowd here on Friday night. Read reviews about how fun this place would be, incorporating a small selection of games and great selection of mixed drinks, but felt understimulated by the lack of enthusiam the bartenders had. Maybe I'd give this place a try on an intimate date, but for now... I think I'll stay at bay."}
{"text":"Wonderful small pub atmosphere and great selection of wine and beer. Can't beat prices. Camaraderie adds to its charm. My fav hangout."}
{"text":"cool place, great happy hour, nice people"}
{"text":"Simply: Go! I wish this place was closer to my home, but maybe it's better that it's not as I'm not sure i would be able to leave.  Their drink selection is EXTENSIVE, and the bar staff has a thought or two about all of them to help narrow down the selection. The inside is cramped, but that just means you're going to get close to your guest.  The bar also has a strong sense of style and a deep collection of games.  Cards Against Humanity gets passed down the bar quite often. The prices are KILLER! ranging from 5$ mystery booze to the high a fancy stuff, and I always seem to end up there at happy hour.  My friends have ordered the grilled cheeses of the differing varieties and had no complaints.  It's the new perfect bar food.  Give it a try.  I think they came with some sort of kettle chip? I don't know.  And finally, they have purse hooks at the bar, which allows me to overlook the crappy parking lot the WP has to share with the Texas BBQ place."}
{"text":"Such a great little place! Not underrated at all. This was the most fun at a bar we have had in a long time. The games and drinks were both fantastic."}
{"text":"First visited The Whining Pig on a Thursday, was back by Saturday. This is an amazing new place and I feel like I've been let into a secret society of craft beers, great service, and delicious cookies.  The atmosphere is super chill and comfortable.  The place is small, very small, but it still feels oh-so-right. They offer a great selection of beer and wine at incredible prices since the Happy Hour goes on from open-8pm! Greg, the owner and also the best bartender you may possibly ever encounter, is very knowledgeable about everything they pour. He also keeps a jar of chocolate handy and frequently shares it with all the patrons, which had me at hello.  As if all that wasn't enough, feel free to grab a board game and add to the fun. Feeling creative? Draw on the chalkboard walls.   I love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for a couple drinks in a casual atmosphere. Pretty small space which I enjoyed. The bartender, Trevor, was spot on and the music was on point. I'd definitely go back again!  They offer about 5 options for grilled cheese sandwiches but when I was there they only had 2 available and neither I was interested in...this is only reason I did t give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome little dive bar! And by little, I mean little! This place is tiny, so it doesn't take much for it to become packed.  That being said, it is very unique and has plenty of games to play while you are thinking some great beer!"}
{"text":"Great little find!  Small but cozy and the board games are a great alternative!  Tons of options and amazing Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I really don't know where the 5stars reviews are coming from. Ok... it is an unique place...  different. Great choice of beers. They could have more food options. Definitely too crowded. I felt like in an overcrowded train wagon. Too bad because I could walk there but I like to have my private conversation a bit more private, and something to eat with my beer.  But you know what? Don't go by this review if rubbing shoulders with other guests is not a big deal for you.  Too many people gave it a 5 star. Maybe you will too."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Greg and his wife are a great team! Atmosphere is relaxed and local. This is a great weekday evening or weekend hang out :-)"}
{"text":"Something for everyone, if you like beer or wine. Yes, it's a little cramped, I call it cozy. Casual & relaxing, a perfect place for a night cap !"}
{"text":"Though she is small, she is mighty!! This has officially become one Of the little places to stop by if you are in town. Great atmosphere, great drink selection, amazing time."}
{"text":"What a great and happening spot! Tiny, yes but great bartenders and fun games to play! SkipBo, 3D tic tac toe and many others! Definitely worth stopping in if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Well. As pretty much every review has stated. As a small dive bar goes, this it how it should be done. Excellent atmosphere, paired with an excellent beer and whine menu. I was sat away from the beer list and unable to see it clearly and the staff described a few beers that ended up being a perfect fit for me.  It was my girlfriends birthday as well and have her a free brownie too! Alongside that, we showed up in perfect time for a complimentary whine tasting!  Although, the bar can be rather loud due to its small size. It adds to the atmosphere. I love this place. Will be a new regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour in the uptown Bethany area! Such a wide variety of beers and wines and good service."}
{"text":"What a gem! They have an amazing selection of craft beers to include brands you wouldn't even find in a Total Wine or BevMo. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and can make on point recommendations based on your taste and style. I'm not a huge wine-o but they seem to also be on their game in this department! Definitely be aware of the cramped space and limited seating- not a place to meet up with more than three friends. Cannot rave enough about their long happy hour time frame and discounted beers for $3.50!"}
{"text":"This place frequently appears on Top Ten lists, and it would deserve to be there if those lists tracked the best small/neighborhood pubs.  They only serve beer, which is not a problem if you know it going in. Their selection of regional and craft brews will certainly keep you and your party satisfied for the entire evening. The bartenders are extremely helpful and friendly, leaning in and making you and your party feel as their personal guests.  The down side is that it is extremely small, and out of the way for most residents of the Valley. If you don't mind the claustrophobic setting (which doesn't matter once you find a place to sit), and driving to a strip mall, then this place is a great spot to hang and enjoy awesome beer."}
{"text":"Don't get the hype.   Drinks were ok. Service was a little odd...  Food we ordered, didn't look like pics-I could have done better at a picnic at Encanto.   Girl in there FREAKING out and crying her eyes out about her \"asshole\" boyfriend.   Brought GF and her BFF there after reading reviews, right before an 8 hour flight....downer"}
{"text":"Wow, my first Yelp review ever. Better this place than never! So, this bar was awesome. I'm the type of person who can have a guilty conscience when I think, \"Crap, I should've told him this in person\" and don't realize until later.   Well to Dan, part owner/part bartender, this is for you: You were seriously SO nice and helpful! You can see your passion for the place and you made our first time here feel very cozy and comfortable, you helped me pick a beer with a palette of literally Miller Lite and Modelo without judging me lol, (but they have a HUGE selection of craft beers as well as a number of wines,) your recommendation was delicious by the way, and you remembered to check in with us unlike at some bars where they leave you high and dry for an hour without even a nod.   You genuinely have a kindhearted, friendly and service driven yet laid back spirit, while making the whole place feel like you're just chillin out with friends in someone's cool loft apartment. We could've stayed longer but had to wake up early. And we were there for almost 3 hours! They have cute little grilled cheese sandwiches of different kinds, (I got pesto with sundries tomatoes and mozzarella,) if you want a snack with your beer.   If you're looking for a chill place to have a great convo with a friend or a little more action on the weekend without it being a cheesy place, come here! Above all, the welcoming, laid back vibe, selection and true hospitality is what stands out. Thanks Dan! You're appreciated!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The only bad side is that it's very cramped. However the music is great. Huge wine and beer selection. The bartender is always on point. They also have some food which is very good as well :). It's a must see!"}
{"text":"What else can I say that hasn't been said in all of the positive posts here? Great, little bar with very cool and knowledgeable owners. One of the best beer and wine menus that changes up all of the time. Love this place and have gone back several times."}
{"text":"Just a cool place. Barkeeps enjoy their jobs, have great knowledge of the menu and like talking brews. I think they have other things available but why come here if not for suds? Many to choose from, all across the spectrum. Come early, grab a seat. Cheers."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars if it had fresh food or more room to move around in. If you don't mind sitting super close to people then it's a fun place to wind down a night with wine or beer. They do have sandwiches you can have warmed if you want. I love that they have small games like trivia games sitting on the counters for people to play."}
{"text":"I heard alot about this place, but wasn't quite sure where it was at. Turns out its right down the street from my best friends moms house who I visit often. I pulled up on a late Tuesday night. And I don't know how so many people can fit in the place. Other Yelpers  weren't kidding when they said this place is small. But it also says that you don't have to have an expensive looking place to cool. I loved The Whining Pig as soon as I stepped foot in the place. The owner was real cool and gave me a little bit of his back story with the place. It was pretty damn inspiring and had me thinking how cool it is to see someone take a chance on a dream to be happy instead of playing it safe in job that provides security but your miserable. There was a couple next to me playing Uno. Which was a nice change of pace to see a couple in bar playing a simple card game over being on their phones. The beer and wine that I tried were both good. And with such a huge selection to choose from. I have to go back again and again. And I got a free hot dog!!!  Go check out the Whining Pig if you haven't already. A true american story lol :)"}
{"text":"This place has a super hip set up with great drinks at a cheap price! Loved it when I went with my buddy. Plus, the bartenders seemed really friendly. Highly recommend going and checking it out. Loved it."}
{"text":"I see this place on my way home from work everyday, so I was pretty stoked to check it out when my friend suggested we go here. It was pretty unique, Greg the bartender was really nice, and they have late night happy hour! Love that! We got the cheese place, which I wasn't super impressive, but I will be back for the wine!"}
{"text":"Such a small and wonderful place. Reminds me of an east coast bar the way its tucked away. Staff is awesome and even on the busiest of nights they have you taken care of. Beer and wine selections are always changing and always interesting."}
{"text":"The Whining Pig is an amazing little dive wine bar. They have talented and personable staff. The beer and wine list is extensive and changes with availability, providing opportunity to explore new options.  On my first visit here, I walked in and didn't think much of the place on sight. Then I sat down and was blown away by the style, flair, and uniqueness that oozes from The Pig. The nostalgia of the games, the one of a kind decor, the staff personalities, and the eclectic music selection, all make me feel accepted and comfortable.  I also love the patrons. The conversation of my fellow drinkers is interesting and inviting of anyone near to join in the fun. One of my favorite things to do is draw on the chalkboard, be it Pictionary or just doodling.   I recommend The Whining Pig to anyone who wants to kick back, join in on some games, have some great conversations, and drink some beer."}
{"text":"Greg and Chrissy are the owners,  awesome and friendly.   Greg is very knowledgable with wines. The happy hour rocks as well as the tunes. Make sure you order the meat and cheese plate. Nice portion!  Thank you the \"sombreros\" for find the Whining Pig\"."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my most favorite \"dive bars\". It is definitely rewarding of 5 stars. I've lived in the uptown Phoenix area for a few years and love visiting this bar for multiple reasons. The bartenders aren't only friendly, but they love finding the \"perfect\" drink for you. Also, expect plenty of free treats from them. Although this place is relatively small, you can always find somewhere to sit/stand (super friendly atmosphere)! Come here with a small group of friends and be prepared to play some card games - they have it all! If you're looking for a bomb dessert, make sure to check-in and get the free brownie. It's a Reese's cup on steroids! I also recommend trying one of the homemade grilled cheeses. Make sure to check out their happy hour one day! Great deals until 8!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees I love it went there for the first time last night with a few friends the drinks were decently priced and there were a lot of good looking women for me and my friends"}
{"text":"This place is great! Always a great time! Amazing grilled cheese and selections of beer! A little small but great things come in small packages! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yes it is small. And that is where the magic begins. The energy is strong and Greg is an amazing bartender/host. Tell him what you would like and you'll get a spot on recommendation.   The cheese and meat plate is a perfect accompaniment to whatever scrumptious beer you fall into.  Get in here and don't be shy. Try several and see what is out there. You will not regret spending even just an hour at Whining Pig."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great knowledgable bartender. Lots of character on the walls and a decent menu of grilled cheese for snacks. We were hopping around Old Town and Tempe and didn't find anything that made sense to us until we got here. Will definitely be coming back when returning to Phoenix."}
{"text":"My roomie and I just moved into our apartment a few weeks ago and saw this place. The name was super catchy, so we decided to give it a try. It is amazing! In a city like Phoenix, where people hangout in their backyards instead of front porch, it's refreshing to find a wine/beer bar that encourages community. I have never been there and not met a new friend from the neighborhood. The bartender is hilarious and can always peg exactly what wine I'm in the mood for. Overall, I absolutely love it! I recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys wine or beer or community or all three! Seriously, the best discovery made since living in uptown!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS BAR! We came across this place on our last night in Phoenix and actually right before we were about to head to the airport. It's small and intimate, very cool bartender with HUGE selection of beer and wine. There's also a bunch of board games that are free for all to use. Our bartender (I believe his name was Kyle) was great! I told him what I wanted in my beer (light wheaty somewhat sweety) and he recommended 2-3 different kinds that were all delicious! He's quite knowledgeable and I also appreciate the HH on the already decently priced drinks. I definitely recommend stopping by this bar if you're in town! :)"}
{"text":"Looking for a Sunday Happy Hour, we checked out Yelp and one of the first choices was The Whining Pig.  After reading some glowing of the reviews, we ventured out and after having some trouble finding the place (it is on the same corner as Texaz Grill) we arrived.  Be advised the bar is very small, I think something like 450 square feet total.  Friendly service, great selection of beer and wine.  Want some water? They will pour that out of a bottle for you for no charge.  No nasty tap water served.  Want a spotless bathroom?  You will find it here, complete with a sunscreen dispenser of all things."}
{"text":"Beyond cute! This tiny gem tucked next to Texaz grill is an example of what is right about North Central Phoenix. They have a great selection of wines and beers from which to choose. I'd be hard pressed to suggest anyone canNOT find something to suit their fancy, here! The decor is adorable, from the penny-lacquered bar top to the actual seating arrangement and the chalk painted walls (yes, that is a fading design trend according to Home & Garden and Elle Decor, but it makes for some fun hangman time - and, in this space, it just works). The atmosphere sets you up for fun interactions and a nice time. We went there on Halloween and quickly found ourselves imbibing of the prosecco and a community (ie the entire bar got involved) game of Cards Against Humanity. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and I believe their enthusiasm and attitudes lend to the overall friendly, cozy, feel one gets walking inside."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  great wine, great owner. Couldnt ask for anythibg better in a neighborhood bar. Highly recommended, happy hour is even better!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! When we went the atmosphere was so inviting. They even had old school games to play that totally took me back to the late 90's. The food menu is very limited,  as it is NOT a restaurant...but the meat and cheese platter was delicious and satisfying. The gentleman that's the owner was so funny and kind...we'll definitely be going back soon"}
{"text":"I lovessss it! Tiny little place that gets super crowded.  Great selection of wines and I love that they have games!"}
{"text":"The only place that doesn't charge for a side of ranch   Bar tender had great recommendations for beer. I was skeptical about the limited menu...grilled cheese or cheese board only but the pepperoni and siracha grilled cheese was the"}
{"text":"Love this place. Tiny \"hole in the wall\" with great wine and beer choices. Service is always great and once you've been there, you're a regular upon your return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The ambiance is friendly and cozy, the owner's hilarious and the Happy Hour drink specials are incredible. My husband and I were able to try out several bottled beers for $3 each- they would normally be double that price. There was also a great looking wine selection. My favorite part of the bar is all the old games from your childhood (and new ones too- Cards Against Humanity!) to play while relaxing and sipping your beverage of choice. I can't wait to head back to Phoenix and try this place out again."}
{"text":"Just had the best time ever at The Whining Pig! The service was perfect and the music was great! Grilled cheese just like mom used to make and an amazing selection of wine and beer. Well done!"}
{"text":"Trevor was amazing. He knows his stuff and gave perfect recommendations to all three of us who stopped in. An intimate environment and a quality staff make for an excellent experience."}
{"text":"The was a cool taproom. Very small but had a great selection of about 30 beers on tap. They also have a nice selection of cans and bottles."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is cozy and the drink selection is varied and plentiful."}
{"text":"We recently stopped in on the last leg of a Vegas-Grand Canyon-Sedona-Phoenix vacation based on the Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. Great beer selection, even if most were bottles and cans, and decent wine selection as well. We didn't try any food, so I can't comment on that. There was no one there when we arrived, but the place started filling up around 4PM. The bartender made great suggestions based on what we liked to drink. Even the regulars had great suggestions and a few of them let me taste their beers! A friendly neighborhood bar where we felt quite comfortable, even though we aren't locals. Met everyone from a PhD who used to teach at Standford, to a teacher who moved from Canada. All in all a great afternoon. Oh, and I got to play with toys at the bar, which is both weird and pretty fun."}
{"text":"I can't possibly say one bad thing about this place.  This bar attracts the friendliest group of people, I never leave without making a new friend.  Excellent selection of beers.  If beer isn't your thing, the owner/bartender is very knowledgeable on the wines he carries and can help you find something perfect for you.  I could sit here for hours and drink and play Cards Against Humanity all day long, if only it were open all day but it doesn't open until 3:00 pm."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Ridiculous beer selection and most of them are $6. Really small which is actually a plus because it cuts down on the idiot factor. Brownies are amazing and the bartender Sam is very friendly and attentive. Must try!"}
{"text":"WOW- this was good. I consider myself an oenophile, so wine rates higher than food in most cases.   Food (or wine in this case): 5 stars Atmosphere: 5 stars Parking: 5 stars Value: 5 stars  overall: 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the \"dive bar\" feel but had a great selection of wine and beer. Came by myself for a quick happy hour before meeting up with a friend so I didn't try the grilled cheese or play any of the board games but next time I definitely will."}
{"text":"As others have said, there really isn't anything else to say but I'm happy to heap on a little more praise. My hats are off to these guys for taking a simple concept and really running with it and making something special with it.  This tiny, simple place serves up an impressive, discerning array of beer and wine at very reasonable prices and they serve it with passion, warmth and hospitality. I was very impressed that they served Kingfisher-it's nice to see some unique imports among the craft offerings.   I unfortunately did not sample any wine because I started with cocktails and ended up with beer. I knew if I finished with wine I would hate myself in the morning....next time. The atmosphere is REALLY fun-a great place to bring your girl or guy because they have all kinds of classic games: Battleship, Operation, Hungry Hungry Hippos and many more.  The best thing about this place is the crowd that it attracts. No assholes, douches, skanks or ho's. Just genuine, down-to-earth people who like to enjoy some good beer and wine in a casual atmosphere. No attitude here, just good beer and wine and good people. What more could you ask for?  And P.S., they LOVE us Yelpers so if you haven't already, show these guys some love!"}
{"text":"This place is very small but has a great environment. Tonight there was great wine tasting and the place had excellent drink selections. The grilled cheese and brownies are also a fantastic bonus. If your group is small and you are looking for a fun and casual environment I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Beer.  So many of the beers!   There is a slight possibility that I may have just found the mecca of cool.    A ton of different games to play while you are partaking in the plethora of hoppy happy treats. Random beers I've never heard of are available for the sipping.    I love how they have their chalkboard color coded so it's \"easier\" to make a decision.    Be warned, the place is quite small...and awesomely dark.  See you there!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's my go to spot! Great employees and owners!"}
{"text":"This has to be the coolest little place to get a drink in Phoenix. It's super cozy which makes it easy to get lost in conversations with the people you come in with or otherwise. This is the kind of bar you go for great wine, tasty beers, good convo and a game of cards against humanity.  The bartender, Chris, was friendly and very helpful and the cookies were a nice touch!"}
{"text":"A great cozy addition! This place is teeny which is part of the charm.  The owner is super friendly and enthusiastic. He shouldn't be surprised by the over night success because this place will please everyone.  Tight seating makes meeting your neighbors a must which was fun.  The penny covered bar top was neato.  :) drink options: many!  price point: so cheap, seriously.  We had the meat & cheese plate and couldn't tear ourselves away.  You know you've meaning to check this place out... don't wait another day!"}
{"text":"Great new place! Bartender was friendly, food and drinks were good, and there were choices for this moscato and cider lover. Our Groupon was for a drink and a brownie apiece, and we ended up ordering the meat and cheese platter as well. It contained a respectable selection of sausages, crackers, and cheeses.   There were old board games scattered around and we amused ourselves going through Trivial Pursuit cards for a while. I even saw Cards Against Humanity behind the counter- I assume you have to ask for that one. I loved the chalkboard menu and didn't have trouble reading it. I'm also sure that the bartender would have been happy to make suggestions if I'd asked.  This place seems to have a few regulars already, which is good. Fair warning, it is a small place. If you are claustrophobic this isn't the bar for you. Tables are packed close and the space at the bar is close as well. If that doesn't bother you, you'll love The Whining Pig."}
{"text":"Great place to catch some great music, wonderful atmosphere  with drinks and friends."}
{"text":"Good beer good wine. The people are a little shady from the bartender to the customers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The bartenders rock, the beer selection is incredible, the happy hour deals are actually worth it, and the grilled cheese is yummy. Ever since a friend introduced me to The Whining Pig, I've been obsessed."}
{"text":"It would be a sin to not visit this watering hole if you're in Phoenix. Weekdays or weekends, nights here are always a blast! John and Clayton bring a chill vibe to the place behind the bar. By far the best place to grab a beer or wine in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, fun games, and good music. Happy hour everyday is a huge plus. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"As many reviews here state:  Small.  But as my five stars state: Awesome!    So I was going on a blind date and she happened to be living in the area.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but it was near her so I figured this would be a prime location.    I showed up with the usual fears one has on a blind date:  Will I show up and have that awkward trying to find you moment.  Will the locale be good? Will it be conducive to talking and finding out more about the girl.  Will it be fun?  Thankfully it was.  I showed up and had no difficulty locating her.  A quick walk in and you see the whole bar.  It's a U shaped bar with stools around it.  A large board displays the beers and wines they have on tap and the bar the atmosphere is conducive to talk, basically you are rubbing elbows with the friendlly crowd within.   The bar is owned by two guys, both of whom are nice as can be.  I walked in and the one of the owners was chatting with my date.  He was a bit blitzed, but he offered his seat immediately to me even though she had reserved one.  He insisted I take the seat and when I did, he plopped down next to me and talked with us.    The bar is small enough that it's efficiently run by one of the owners and his wife.  The folks there really like their beverages, and I, being a beer afficionado, was pleasantly surprised to find a broad selection of beverages to my liking.    So we get to the date, I'm a bit timid but the girl was beautiful and friendly, and the group was welcoming.  We talked for a bit, and marvelled over the games they had there.  They had one, which was Cards Against Humaniity, which we both loved but never got to playing because we were enjoying talking with another couple there. The plus side, people were super friendly.  The downside is that I spent more time learning about the other couple than I did the date.  Trust me, that was the only reason I would suggest any other locale for a date.  It's a bit divey, much like a good college bar, but well maintained.  A single bathroom treats both the ladies and the gents, so no complaining about lines ladies, we both suffer. However, the lines weren't an issue, as many of the folks there.    It was a great time.  I got to try several beers that were new and unique to the area.  A huge plus.  I got to hang with some beautiful company and get to know some new folks in the area!  Eventually the bar thinned out, as many do at about 12 at night in Phoenix.  We lasted till about 1:30 and I got to have a little one on one time with her.    As I walked her to her car, which was in broad view of the bar, I got to kiss the girl.  We started, and as we went in for the second kiss, the one that's a bit deeper, we heard the bar cheering.  She was laughing so hard that more kissing was out of the question.  Thanks guys, worst wingmen ever!    That said, I was at Magnum's before this, so no matter how much water, beer, and chewing gum I had, I knew I still had the flavor of cigar on me. The date was impromptu, so I was thankful that I even got the kiss in the first place.  Anyways, The Whining Pig is well worth the five star reputation that it's recieved.  Over 100 yelp peer reviews and it still deserves it.  If I ever get over the embarassment of being heckled at the bar, I will be back.    Lets face it.  I will be back.  As far as the second date, we shall see.  I know I wasn't in prime kissing mode and should I come back for another date here, I'll be more prepared!  Good job guys.  You have an excellent establishment."}
{"text":"Last Sunday was my first visit to the whining pig. I was impressed with the beer selection. The atmosphere was really good. The bartender greeted everyone walking in the door. She also knew everything about the many beers that they have. I'm a big fan of good service and knowledge of product. I will be back! LP"}
{"text":"Worth our drive from Gilbert!  A great happy hour, fun games and awesome wine!  Just the best"}
{"text":"Fantastic owner. The hype is real. If you enjoy beer and/or wine. You must check this place out.  The coolest thing about this place is that you can take any beer to go (all cans and bottles - no drafts) and if you do, they give them to you for Happy Hour cost!"}
{"text":"Still great and such a chill little place, but I still don't want you to know about it.   It has nothing to do with there being a clique of regulars here that you will be excluded from, or with there being a secret handshake- no. It's such a small space with so little room that barstools are at a premium and very coveted.  There aren't any taps but this is the best place in the valley to try a new (or new to you) beer."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is amazeballs!! $5.00 wines and $3.00 beers!! Can't beat that! The atmosphere is really chill and the owners are very involved, serving drinks and all! They are super friendly and have great suggestions!! I will be back here for sure!! I'm in love with the giant chalk board too! And they have pictionary!! What is not to love!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hot spot! Lots of beer and wine selections! Fun people- reminds me of Cheers....where everybody knows your name."}
{"text":"Great spot to have a few brews (or wine) and meet some friends for Happy Hour. These guys do it right!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best new bar in Phoenix. A must for beer and wine lovers. I will describe what I'm looking for in a beer and Greg will make it happen. Still the only place I have ever had Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA. I had a grilled cheese last weekend and it really hit the spot for a late night munchies craving."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the wide selection of drinks!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of wine and craft beers at reasonable prices. What a great concept!  Great atmosphere with the old-time games in a great place to meet friends.  The soundtrack is almost as good as Windsor!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Cutest little neighborhood bar! The staff and the people that go there are friendly. Great place to make new friends :) PS the bartender Rubi is a doll!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Greg is awesome, and he really takes care of his guests. Great place to drink yummy wine and beer. Feels like your in someone's home, in a good way. Great selection, awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Such an awesome idea having all the games.. We have a blast every time we come here. The place is a little small but it seems like everyone always finds ways to make room and we always end up making new friends. Owners are friendly and the wife makes delicious treats!!... Trust me, use your check in offer! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Met some new friends at the bar, and owner is very friendly. Meat and cheese plate is excellent. Beer list is hearty, although a bit mainstream for the craft beer aficionado. Happy hour is a great deal, and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is just as good as every review you read. Happy hour lasts till 8 with great prices. Not to mention a expansive selection of all craft beers. Which are included in the happy hour (because that is pretty much all they have and that's great!) The atmosphere is fun. The place is small but they are great at keeping your glass full. Will be a place we go back to often."}
{"text":"Love it here! The female bartender with the glasses, I apologize for not knowing her name, is GREAT! She definitely builds the atmosphere and is a great asset to the establishment! Went there for hangman night hosted by Ballast Point Brewery & another brewery and had a BLAST! The beer selection is STUPENDOUS! Happy hour is the business here! $3-$5 pints until 8pm!!! Who does that?! The Whining Pig!"}
{"text":"Great local spot with a fantastic happy hour.  They have a nice wine selection, extensive beer list, great bartender, and fun, interactive games in abundance.  It is tiny and parking is a bear.  Other than that, it's a great place to start your evening."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my boyfriend not only for the happy hour wine and beer, but also for the vintage games! Brings back childhood memories! Plus, the bartenders are always very friendly and conversational, so it makes it an overall A+ atmosphere. Parking can be a little tricky and it's definitely a tight squeeze inside if it's busy, but I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"I did not expect much from The whining Pig for some reason, but it's super duper awesome! It's the perfect neighborhood bar - small (like tiny - seats 15, I'd guess), has all kinds of fun games to play while you're hanging out with your friends or making new ones, friendly bartenders, and CHEAP! HH started again at 10 (or 11?) and then wine was $5/glass and beers were $3! Ps, they have a great selection of craft beers.  I wish it was MY neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Love it.. Wine, games, fun beers, pretty good sweet treats are all good but the service- that's where it's at. Dumb example: Greg once gave us a cookie for moving down a seat to make room. I'm stupid for remembering that... yes, but that's the way to present your business if you want to keep people coming back."}
{"text":"One visit and I'm an instant fan.  Great little (really little) beer & wine bar.  The fact that it's so cozy lends to how vivacious it can be when a a few happy, talkative patrons are there.   I wanna say it's divey, but it's not really divey.     The pros:  -- Tons, tons and more tons of craft beers.   I love craft beers, so tons of craft beers is great great stuff.   -- Great bartending.  My bartender was 100% on his game, even though the bar was full. -- $4 White Bag Special.  Order a white bag special and you get the bartender's choice.  He'll select a canned craft beer, place it in a white paper bag and plop it down in front of you.  Taking chances can be fun, and it's a good time trying to guess what it is that you're drinking before you take a peek at the label. -- Games.  Try your hand at some timeless Trivial Pursuit, play with various and sundry toys, whatever.  Keeps it fresh.     I'll stop in again for sure.  Probably several more times :)"}
{"text":"Come here, drink good beer and wine. meet the locals. This is a bar for a city that's finally getting a personality."}
{"text":"Lots of beer options and the fig sandwich was yummy. However this place is really small. For a Thursday happy hour, it was packed. Not a place for a big group."}
{"text":"Greg the owner will be pouring your beer or wine.  Very attentive and nice small wine bar to add to the 16th st and Bethany area.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place make you feel like your at home with friends drinking a beer . Love the theme and how you can draw on the wall with chalk . Theres game boards you can play . Its a bit tight in there . I like this casual lil place . Ill be sure to come more often now that I found it ."}
{"text":"Love this cute little bar! Friendly staff, wonderful happy hour and fun games to play."}
{"text":"Stopping on our way back to LA and glad yelp directed us here. They have the biggest menu of beers (and wine) I have ever seen and delicious! Coolest vibe! The bartender was very knowledgeable and social! Had several sweet beers and they were great. My aunt had a wine flight and choices were very good. My honey had breakfast in a beer, it tasted so good. Pancake something - I'm buzzed already! Lol. He also had a coconut something and I had the strawberry blonde, the watermelon something and the blueberry something! Lol. Great place! Stop b and take off the edge."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Let me start by coming clean and admitting that I am not a drinker. I did, however have a glass of sangria. The bartenders were both knowledge and charming hosts. They recommended hard to find beers for my companion and wanted to give each customer the right beer or wine for them. Very impressive. They truly know their stuff. We also had a grilled cheese sandwich, and checked in on yelp and got a free brownie for dessert.   But by far the best part of the experience...the vibe! There was great music playing (which changed as it got later and busier) and the bartenders knew their music as well as they knew their liquor :)  There are also games galore to play as you sit. There is no rush, and you could sit there all night and never get bored. We had a wonderful time and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Aaaaamazing~ such an awesome new hang out spot!  Here are a few highlights: The prices are great, I really recommend the happy hour from 1 to 8pm! Services was very helpful helping me pick a wine that I would like! The guy even let me sample a small amount before I bought a glass- and of course I ended up buying a bottle!  The decor is beautiful!  You can write on the chalk wall!   The only thing I didnt like was the sign out front!! But there was no way I was going to dock points for that.   You NEED to try this place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I needed a place to drink some wine tonight. I happened to see The Whining Pig on yelp and wanted to give it a try.   It. Was. Awesome.  The drinks were great, service and atmosphere were wonderful and Greg is FANTASTIC at making drink recommendations! I will definitely come back here again, and can see, although tiny, this establishment is worthy of the #1 bar on yelp in the US recognition!"}
{"text":"Greatest Place Ever Invented. And now there's two locations. Heaven on Earth.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bar in Phoenix; in all of Arizona I think. There are a couple of reasons for that.  First; this is truly a unique and one-of-a-kind place. It is very small, so note this is not the kind of place to bring a large group of people. This is great for a small hangout or a nice casual date. But, this is also the appeal, its not some loud, crazy place. It's relaxing, chill and laid back.  Second, the beer selection is amazing. They have an entire wall chalk-board of their selection or bottled/can beers; as well as a great selection of wines. This is also unique, because they have no beers on tap, only bottle and can selections. Now, not only do they have a huge selection, the two guys working there were extremely knowledgeable about all of them. They told us everything about each beer and made terrific suggestions when we asked. Third, they have happy hour till 8, that's crazy! Like I said, new favorite place."}
{"text":"Greg is so nice and sweet. Very fast and welcomes you to this small little bar. It feels like I am part of the group. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I love the Whining Pig so much that there is a huge part of me that doesn't want to write a yelp review. I happily stumbled across The Whining Pig on yelp a couple of weeks ago and have been wanting to check the place out ever since! Unfortunately my friends are all losers so I took myself on a date to The Whining Pig for Happy Hour! The thought of checking out a Wine/Beer Bar alone would be daunting, but whatever I decided to just go for it! I had such a great time, I happened to sit next to a super friendly Phoenix Fireman who kept me entertained for a few hours, Greg the ever friendly owner recommended a fantastic Chardonnay (that I might add was $5.00 for happy hour) and was friendly enough to open a Blonde ale beer to let me try since beer frankly scares me!  I can't wait to go back and partake is some trivial pursuit, listen to some awesome music and drink fantastic wine!"}
{"text":"If this place was in the Bay Area, you bet I'd be going regularly.  A tiny little place with mostly seats around the bar in a U shape and 1 bartender/host, it is definitely a cozy place.  They have everything good in my book: decent wine selection, great beer selection, lots of board games, reasonable pricing, fun chalk art on the wall and cute trinkets all over the place.  Our bartender was really cool and gave excellent suggestions for IPAs because that's what my BF loves to drink.  I've been getting into beer a little more recently and loved each of the beer he suggested.  Hop Juice was one of the best ones and he also poured me a strawberry cider that was super delicious without being too sweet.  You can tell regulars frequent this place as the bartender/host/partial owner chats up with each of his patrons in a relaxed, friendly way.  We played Connect Four like champs and had way too much fun.  We were going to bar hop that night but this place was so great that we ended up staying until past 2am.  Even though the bar closed at 2am, our bartender was super chill and just let everyone hang out without rushing people out the door.  Man, I love this place."}
{"text":"Tiny place, gigantic counter wrapped around the bar. It's lovely and intimate. Huge selection of wine and beer. Don't bring a large group of people, but take a friend or two and enjoy some fantastic conversation. And if you're ever out of words, there are a ton of card and board games all across the counter to keep the fun rolling."}
{"text":"Alright fine, I'll keep the 5 star rating going...   is it 5 star? I'd say closer to 4.5, but I'll round up.   Is it the best bar in the US, as they advertise? No. Is it the best bar I've ever been to? No. Is it a fun bar where you and your friends will get tanked and have a great time while trying some new beer and wine? Yes, yes it is...   also this place is TINY. pictures don't do it justice how small it is."}
{"text":"Our experience at The Whining Pig was perfect. We were looking for a little place to get a drink and we came across this wine/bar pub. The bartenders were fun, attentive, and entertaining.   The bar has a chalkboard of all their wines/beers categorized by prices.They have tons of craft beers! The selection is huge, so you'll have a hard time deciding which drink to enjoy!   The bar itself is very small, which makes it more cozy and intimate inside. That being said, the busier it gets, the less chance you have of getting a seat. We got there around 10pm and their was plenty of room. As the night went on, it started to get really crowded.  As entertainment, the bar is full of board games and toy figures to entertain you and your company. It's a great place!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo much FUN!  The owner Greg is such a good guy; friendly,  knowledgeable,  never intrusive but always approachable and helpful.  The wines are wonderful and affordable.  Great first date bar!   You cant go wrong - check it out for yourself!!!!"}
{"text":"If i could put zero stars unfortunately i would.  Someone said something to me about checking out the Arcadia Pig but we found ourselves by this one so we stopped in to check it out...the most unfriendly unwelcoming, unhospitable expierence i can think of in a long time.  The bartender / manager gave us the coldest shoulder, very unwelcoming and when i said i like hefe's he said, begrudgingly to hurry the process along for him, ill pick one for you.  I said ok, and in 5 seconds i had a Widmer American Hefe only to find, as i sat there drinking its blandness, that there were a number of Gernan and Belgin choices.  Do your self and others a favor and steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I went on a Friday night and it was jam packed. It was a lot of fun and they have several fun games to keep you entertained including old video games from your childhood"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The Pig was the highlight of my Phoenix trip. The bartender, the one from NJ (forgot his name) was awesome. He had a great personality. We played a few games and really enjoyed our visit there. The happy hour is great with some wonderful wines. My guest enjoyed that there was a large array of ciders that he could choose from. Love, love this place. I'll definitely make this a staple when i return."}
{"text":"The stories are all true!! Killer establishment, chill vibes, and a great bartender/ owner. Bruno Mars never stops playing and the bartender never stops dancing. A true hidden gem in the desert. Happy hour may be the best deal around with $3 beer and 5$ glasses of wine. Come on down for a good pour."}
{"text":"I went here based on yelps review.  I remember walking in and being like, wow this is the 5 star place?  its very small, i mean very small.  You need to be slender to move about here ;)  I ordered a couple of drinks, and wasn't really impressed with any of them.  The atmosphere was fun, people seemed happy to be there.  The staff appeared happy to be there.  It was packed (considering the size) I had to sit on a beer box, and yes that is normal there.  I guess a good word to describe this place is intimate.    On the black board it says, highest rated bar on yelp in the USA.  As i read this, I turned to my friend and said I don't know how they pulled this off.  Well as I said that the bar tender started handing out complimentary frozen gummy bears!  Apparently the key to my heart are frozen gummy bears.  What a nice touch!  It raised the mood.  So this made me realize how this place works.  They do stuff that not everyone does, and often it has a positive impact on the atmosphere.  They also had loads of little cool games that people can play.  Overall worth grabbing a drink!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bar, and that is quite a statement for me to make given that it lacks two things that I cherish in any bar--draft beer and a selection of food. The bar has numerous beer selections in bottles and cans, and offers a cheese and meat platter that was quite tasty.   What this bar does have is one of the best damn bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. Liz was everything a bartender should be; attentive, friendly, informative. I would have stayed at this bar if they were serving cheese whiz and coors lite for her alone. She made the experience awesome."}
{"text":"A fun spot to kick back and try a variety of wines and beers, all for a great price! The employees were awesome when I asked for recommendations, and they had some solid food options."}
{"text":"Greg and his staff are welcoming and knowledgeable. Happy hour is a no brainer. $5 vino? I'm there."}
{"text":"Walking in for the first time can be overwhelming, the place is small.  Once you settle in, you WILL get comfortable.  The place is legit with a great selection of beer and wine.  The staff is super duper friendly.  Love this place."}
{"text":"First off the bartenders were super nice and welcoming, they did their best to make it a good experience.   Their beer selection is good. It's really the concept that I wasn't a fan of. It's basically a little beer bar with lots of craft beer selections (they have wine too). The space is really small and there's a single shared bathroom I think? They will pop a can or bottle and pour it in a glass for you. If you're into that sort of thing then you'll be content.   I personally like draft beer when I go out. I live next to both a bevmo and a total wine which have more craft beer options in a can or bottle than any bar.   You can get a 6 pack of huss koffee kolsh for 8.99 at total wine and getting a single can here was 5 bucks. I guess that's why the concept of a place like this is lost on me lol. It looked like the place had food like a grilled cheese available too but it didn't seem like a great space to eat in."}
{"text":"It's a charming place which brings you back to the carefree days of writing with chalk on a black board and fun board games to keep you occupy while the server pours you a much needed beverage after a long work day. The service was perfect considering how busy they become and how loud it gets.. very typical with all neighborhood bars.  Happy Hour is extended until 8pm with an array of $5 wines and $3 beers.  The place is a lot smaller than pictures posted and seating is very limited.  The food and cheese platter is nothing spectacular and I would just skip the brownie all together.  I would give this place a better rating should they serve better food and possibly repositioning their table away from the restroom."}
{"text":"Love this cute little bar. My only complaint is by little I mean tiny. It gets packed people during happy hour cause the menu is good and very extensive. No draft all bottles/cans. I like the sweet white wines abd they usually have 2 on the menu. There is a chalkboard to write and draw on which is cool. Oh and some old school games. I keep coming back, everyone I bring there loves it too and plans to return."}
{"text":"Greg makes sure to take care of everyone in his bar. His knowledge about wine is unbelievable!  The relaxed, welcoming ambiance to EVERYONE its remarkable.  Now, opening the Pig's Meow he is just expanding his greatness in town. Cheers to your success  buddy!"}
{"text":"At first glance, the Whinnig Pig doesnt look like much and is very unassuming, but this place delivers big on wine and experience.  Here are 5 things you should know about this place:    - Seating is limited (maybe 12-15 seats at the most) - Wine and beer menu is pretty expansive and written on a chalk board (list changes frequently) - They give you Smart water instead of tap (thankfully) - They dont really serve food aside from a meat & cheese plate, chips, etc.   - Environment is super fun so be prepared to have a great time (you could go there alone and easily come out with 5 new friends)  Its located in the middle of small strip mall next to a salon and few other stores.  Parking is available in front and back of the building  This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix...definitely check it out!  BTW they have happy hour all day Sunday!"}
{"text":"When I walked in to the Whining Pig I thought there's no way it could be five stars but boy was I wrong.  They don't serve alcohol But have a great beer and wine selection which they have fun with by offering a mystery wine or white bag beer.  I'll be looking forward to the next time when I can pull up to the bar to drink my beer out of a white paper bag while playing some Cards Against Humanity."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect example of what a neighborhood bar should be like! This tiny spot reminds me of the Osterias in Italy, unassuming and to the point! I live in he uptown neighborhood and have a passion for wine so I couldn't wait to check it out. When I first walked in I was a little shocked at how small it was but not in a claustrophobic way. The esthetics were eclectic and DIY which gives the place a lot of character. The owner, and a cute older gentlemen who I assume was his dad (mainly because he kept calling him dad lol) were both very friendly and had some good suggestions on wine. We had a meat and cheese plate, which dad made, and it was delicious as were the wines the owner suggested.  I like the fact that they don't waste paper on reprinting menus and instead write on the chalkboard walls.   When we left my friends and I were very pleased as were our wallets! Needless to say I will be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have a glass of wine and relax.  Bartenders are awesome and the bar is small.  Happy hour can't be beat.  Great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I love this place it is such a friendly and happy atmosphere. I work down the street and I invite all my clients to have a drink here and they end up loving it. The bartender is always such a good Spirit with a positive vibe. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Every time I come in this place I get weird service. It doesn't have a welcoming vibe. At all. Because of that I probably will never go back. Too bad because it could be a very cool place."}
{"text":"Hard to imagine a better experience! Drove by on our way to dinner and saw that it was packed around 6pm. Crossed our fingers and hoped we would be be able to get in when we finished at Fuego Bistro.  On our return we had to just pull into the front parking area and take our chances...  So glad we did!  Hard to imagine a more congenial and truly social setting! While it is tiny, the place is bursting with personality.  You will not only enjoy the company of Greg, but also the other patrons in the place.  Everything is set up to feel like you are hanging out a friend's party.   Have since made a second visit with good friends and again, had a ball and Greg proved that he is an excellent host...I say host, because you do feel like he has welcomed you to back to his place."}
{"text":"Small fabulous place, lots of choices for beer and wine! Leave all your.friends at home and make new ones when hanging out around the bar!"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service, quirky vibe, cute, unique spot for a drink, and good wine and beer selection. It is a small spot, so it can get a little crowded, but nice later happy hour."}
{"text":"They have alcohol, games and character. Come with an open mind and a willingness to search for parking. It's a hole in the wall place with an eclectic mix of customers. But you will all have one thing in common... You like to drink good things that are cheap and local! They have some food that can get you by if you come hungry. Definitely a place that you will want to become a regular! I will be coming back, but I will probably ride my bike next time!"}
{"text":"Wide selections of wine and beer drew us in twice in one week, even though the seating was limited.  We managed to get seats both times and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere of this little space.  Clay and Ruby were gracious, welcoming hosts that added to the overall happy vibe.  We're adding this to the list of regular stops when visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been here so much never on the weekend but Also never had a hard time finding a seat! Always the best beers and three will have some bring you LOVE! Hope to see more open"}
{"text":"Cool bar, great beers, great wine list with something for everyone. We will be back. It's rare to find a place that the owner actually cares about the bar's product anywhere these days so this is definitely a breath of fresh air. I'm new to Phoenix and so relieved I found a place not run like a major chain!"}
{"text":"I came out here on a Thursday night with my husband to have some drinks and check out downtown. We came here based on the numerous positive reviews.   The pros of this place: TONS of drink options (sangria, beers, hard liquor, and even special bar concoctions), amazing chalk art on the walls and a bunch of unique game choices to play while you drink   The main opportunity for improvement for me would be more attentive service, especially during \"happy hour\". My group of three was able to each order a beer and our bartender did not return until happy hour was over - this is a Thursday and the bar was decently crowded. At that point most of the people in group had already given up hope of getting the bartender's attention to order more drinks"}
{"text":"The Whining Pig seems much smaller than what the room I imagine in Alice in Wonderland would be but I like it!  Parking is limited.  Space is limited.  So if you are planning to make this a stop with 6 of your closet friends, I would recommend earlier than later.   A great selection of wine and beer are available.  I had ordered the chips and salsa and I would recommend skipping this and getting the meat and cheese plate instead.    Great place to meet new people or hang and talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile and catch up!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Really charming. The bartender even gave me an apple to munch on when I told him I was a vegan. Very small space so keep that in mind, but we went with a big group on a Thursday and it was fine."}
{"text":"If you are lucky enough to find a seat at this cozy, vintage little gem you will never want to leave. This is an awesome happy hour spot with great wines and craft beer. The bartender/owner is friendly, funny and very knowledgeable about his pours. (And shares my father's name - hey Greg Allen!!)! They serve baked good, treats, cheese plates and other nosh items.   It truly is a neighbor bar because I run in to people I know every time I come in. Do me a favor and don't tell your friends about this place. It's almost too cool to share"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff, and certainly a one-of-a-kind place in Phoenix. You can't beat the beer selection (creatively written in chalk on the wall). Oh, and the music selection is enough to stick around! A lot of throwbacks. The long happy hour is what initially made me stop in. They really have unbeatable prices till 8 PM!"}
{"text":"Ah the whining pig, though small it is great. This quaint beer bar offers a huge selection of craft beer and nostalgic board games as well as card games. A must see hang out"}
{"text":"I love this tiny bar!   I literally live a few blocks from here so I walk.. SUPER BROWNIE POINTS!  This bar has so much character and everyone is so friendly. I always make a new friend here.  They also have some really good beer. My favorite ballast point. I've ordered their wine flight and I loved it. Tasting new wines was fun.  They also have board games and card games all over this bar so it makes it really easy to have fun lol.  The only downside is how super small this place is. It's kind of bitter sweet. Bitter because sometimes you won't find a spot to chill at. Sweet because it makes it feel homey in a way. It's like you're at friends house having drinks with friends. Pretty cool! ALSO IF YOU LEAVE THIS BAR AROUND 11pm keep an eye out for pj!! This guy sets up a hot dog/taco stand and OMG! All I have to say the best after bar spot! #score"}
{"text":"Had to stop in simply based on the stellar reviews on Yelp...and I understand why it's so popular.  The smaller size is definitely part of the charm; a unique concept that definitely works.  From the drink selection to the friendly bartender and friendly people this establishment attracts, I'd encourage everyone to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Small bar with awesome wine & beer selections and a fun atmosphere! Not to mention a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Whining Pig is truly as good as it gets for what it is.  This place has achieved regular rotation in my list of friendly establishments.  It almost has this speakeasy feel to it.  The owner is just as friendly as the bar itself."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Greg, the owner is fantastic and always had a great wine for me to try.  I even asked him to contact a small brewery to get my favorite new beer and it'll be in stock at the end of the month.  I can't say enough good things about this bar."}
{"text":"I'm all about finding deals on obscure craft beers, so when I can get the good stuff at $3 a bottle any day before 8pm, I'm in a happy place. Yes, this is seriously in the running for best drink special in town. Of course, I've still got some reservations.  If you've got claustrophobia (before you ask, I don't), avoid this place at all costs. It has less walking space than your average hotel room. Sitting in front of the beer list makes it a pain to read. You will oddly position yourself out of the way every time someone needs to use the restroom in the corner.   That being said, I'm not about to hate on this establishment because it's the tiniest bar I've ever set foot in. There are some gems to be found, and a great owner who knows his stuff about beer. I thought it was so considerate when he tried to warn/lecture this expert about how a beer would taste. The enthusiasm is cloying to a snob like yours truly, but it lets me know I can bring amateurs here, and they won't order a brew they'll hate.   My yelper pal, Ryan W., knows tons more about wine than me and swears this place is legit. Something about 2009 and fires in northern California lending to the price and exquisite taste of his most prized selections. Mad street cred.   As for snacks, there's the whole local sausage plate as well as some nice brownies. Yelpers who check in the first time can nab a sweet treat on the house! What a great business strategy.   As far as the social scene, be prepared to talk with strangers. It's got that real neighborhood feel to it. Maybe you can challenge someone to a game of Connect Four!   In a bustling urban center with no shortage of craft beer watering holes, this is another posh place to enjoy a diverse selection of beer/wine at a competitively low price. To me, it's a formidable option to pregame your night in CenPho, but not by any means the bar I'd consider THE destination. You'll never be able to bring a group, but you'll be able to share time with a best friend or two. If you're in the area, don't hesitate giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"A very chill spot with an amazing selection of drinks (wine and beer only) and the coolest bartender, very knowledgable and friendly. There are plenty of old school games to play, such as connect four, rock'em sock'em, trouble and much more. Great place to come if you're ever in the central Phoenix area. Intimate setting with a neighborhood bar feel. Would definitely come back if I'm ever back in town."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Excellent vibe, beer and wine prices, games, grilled cheese.. Oh sorry, hipster grilled cheese aka fig spread prosciutto and goat cheese, and service. It's small, but intimate, and certainly is fun."}
{"text":"The whining pig is my favorite watering hole. The five dollar \"mystery wine\" bought me an impromptu wine lesson with the owner. The music is great. The trivia and games scattered about the bar add to the charm and family feel. Go early and often, this place gets packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Snapshot: 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5 HH & Cost  If you're into games, beers and just a positive vibe, check out The Whining Pig.  The HH board is fantastic, huge selection of beers and wine.  Plus, they have an infinite amount of board games and throwback nostalgia."}
{"text":"I love this bar and I can't say enough great things about it! Greg is always very welcoming and very knowledgable about wines and beers to help me find the perfect selection. Best bar in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Came for the wall of beers and amazing happy hour prices and stayed for the brownies. Hugh selection of beers color coded by style. Definitely something for everyone. I'm not much for wine but I'm sure they do it right asswell.  Garrett knew his beers and helped steer us in the right direction. My new favorite bar in AZ."}
{"text":"If I could this place 6 stars, I would.  Came here with friends before a party and had a great time.  Great wine selection and the grilled cheese sandwiches were on point.  Bartenders are awesome, majority of the music is from the mid 90s, and the crowd is down to have a good time.  Was so good that we returned back after the party.  Will return again soon!"}
{"text":"WHAT A SPOT. Came here with my brother after eating and drinking. We were looking for the next place to hit up and came across this place on Yelp. We expected a big bar with lots of people and lots of games. To our surprise, the bar was really small with maybe about 10 seats and that's it. All their games are scattered around - but easy to locate. The beer selection here is INCREDIBLE. So many beers and best of all is that its super affordable.   What made the night was the bartender - extremely funny and down to earth. I would come here all the time if I could."}
{"text":"Legit beer and wine bar. Tiny hole in the wall spot, the \"blink and you'll miss it\" kind of place. Knowledgeable bartenders, chill environment, nice happy hour.  Wasn't hungry, but the grilled cheese menu looks legit. I'll be back to try it."}
{"text":"Very friendly folks and lots to chose from for drinks and food.  Too small to be comfortable for me.  No place to put your legs under a bar."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, excellent service, fun atmosphere, tiny space makes it easy to chat with other patrons. I sat at the bar with the surface decorated in shiny and darker pennies, which I thought were randomly placed. Then I realized the shiny pennies were in the shape of a pig, complete with a curly tail. The discovery of this penny pig made my night."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Whining pig yesterday.  Small place but great drinking spot.  Great beer selection and their meat and cheese platter was HUGE!"}
{"text":"Best wine bar in Arizona!   What a GEM! They have fun games, fantastic music!  The owner doesn't have a staff he is a lawyer who didn't want to do that anymore and opened up a wine bar is dad work her and wife on occasion.   The wine selection is fantastic.. Cool fun beers also.. They don't have hard liquor but that isn't a problem they have a white wine similar to a vodka..   Cant wait to be back!   Amazing happy hours!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING  about this bar is amazing!!!  Happy hour is until 8pm - wine and beer around $3-4 Full of childhood games to play whole you are getting hammered - operation, hungry hungry hippos, sock'em bop'em and tons of others Bartender is the friendliest ever!!! And very knowledgeable Bar food is limited but absolutely perfect to snack on.  I am from jersey and I got wasted for $45. Best ever! I will return anytime I am in the area."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and was just too packed for my liking. It was relatively early in the evening about 8pm, so I can only image how much worse it was going to get. There was 1 bartender so it took a few extra minutes to get his attention. There was another guy behind the bar, but he was just standing there doing nothing, so I don't know who he was. They have a good beer selection but it's not worth the invasion of personal space.  So for me it's just OK, but if you don't mind your neighbor's purse smacking you in the head, or people screaming 2 inches from your ear then this bar is for you.  We walked around the corner to the Vig Uptown, it was much easier to have a conversation there."}
{"text":"Hipsteriffic little offbeat beer/wine pub within walking distance (for me), and their happy hour runs until 8.   Wow.  The only downside: It's really small and is getting pretty popular.  Hop on your single-speed and head up there sometime."}
{"text":"Where else would you be when you cannot find that one place? Well here it is - rooted in sincerity & community... Oh and yes there is great wine!"}
{"text":"K.I.S.S. = Keep It Simple Stupid And they do. They have wine. They have beer. The make grilled cheeses on a panini press. They have a rather wide variety of wine and beer, with new things coming in frequently. It's enough to keep the unadventurous happy and the adventurous excited to try something new and different. The bartenders know their product and they know their customers and they remember what you like and aren't afraid to make new suggestions and let you try things. They're fun and friendly and welcome everyone with a smile and a handshake. For a place that really only serves 3 things, I can't speak highly enough about it!"}
{"text":"As far as wine and beer bars, these guys are the best. Great atmosphere, selection is outstanding and the service is first rate. Huge selection of both wine and beers. Outstanding."}
{"text":"It's a very chill bar with the most selection of wine and beers! Great happy hour - until 8pm on a Saturday! Bartender played great music and amazing customer service! I will definitely come back! There are some games like trivial pursuit available too! We enjoyed it a lot!"}
{"text":"So much fun in a small package. We enjoyed our visit so much ... I love the addition of games. What a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Sam was such a wonderful bartender. She was so helpful in choosing wines we would like and very attentive with all the guests. Great bar!"}
{"text":"BEST BAR IN PHOENIX.  Seriously, it is the best bar in Phoenix. Ok, I get that it all depends on personal preference, but after only one visit, I love this place. It is sort of a dive bar with a hipster vibe mixed in. Very urban decor and atmosphere, it doesn't feel like you are in Phoenix. It has a great beer and wine list, which is listed on the wall in chalk. The bar is full of party games, many of which I haven't seen since I was a child. For food we only had the brownies, which were excellent, but saw some others with the cheese board and pizza and both made me we wish I wasn't already stuffed from another Phoenix mainstay. Awesome place, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I first heard we were going to the Whining Pig I wasn't sure what to expect.  What I found was an awesome, although very small, gem in the rough.  Seating is definitely limited but it helps provide a coziness and charm to the place.  This bar specializes in wine and craft beers and has an awesome happy hour until 8 pm. While the I got to meet the owner who was very nice and let me sample my wine choice before I ordered the glass. I have to admit that I did sample a very delicious peanut butter brownie, it was super rich but I enjoyed every bite. Tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup in pastry form :) The bar top is nearly 30000 pennies which is fun to look at and the cash register is an awe inspiring antique style register. Trivia cards scatter the top so that you can amazing your friends with your knowledge.  I fell in love with this place on my first visit."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned when I pulled up to this place and saw how tiny it was. However, once I got in there I was not disappointed. Checking in at the whining pig got me a promotional offer for a free brownie from this place. This brownie was amazing and had just the right amount of peanut butter. The bartender recommended I try it with an Achocolypse and it was one of the best beer/food dessert combo's I've had.  While it is a small bar, it has games all around the bar. My girlfriend and I picked up the Office Trivia game and killed some time with our drinks. I don't recall the bartenders name but it was a very attentive woman who looked to be in her early twenties. She kept running back to see if i needed anything despite being the only bartender on duty at the time.  The service is great, the dessert is great and they have a nice selection of beers hidden in a small little area. It truly is a little hidden gem in the Phoenix Area. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hey you guy's, I'm a hard core health foodie at heart, but this place is worth going to when you want to treat yourself.  SO much fun playing the game's with my husband (took him on a date there:) The wine was AWESOME, the atmosphere BRILLIANT and the meat and cheese plate as well as the chips and salsa was so great. We will be back with friends, you should add a few more food options because you are about to be found by the public!!! YAY!!!!  more on my blog if you would like to check it out http://chloefreedomblog.wordpress.com/"}
{"text":"This bar rocks! The parking to get there is a little bit tight, but when you walk in, it is a cozy u-shaped bar with tons of games to play with your friends: Trivial Pursuit, Yahtzee, Connect Four, etc. The crowd is pretty chill and friendly, and the bartender was very knowledgeable.  I was in a mood for a cider and she recommended me one from the Netherlands I'd never heard of. It tasted crisp, light, and like champagne.  Shout out to the young, dark haired bartender with big eyes who changed my life!  Their happy hour specials are very good as well, ranging from $3-5, and their selection is a mix of tried and true beers along with local brews and imports, so you can find anything you're in the mood for.  Super points, if you check in with your Yelp app, you get a free brownie! *Do not skip on the brownie, it has a lovely peanut butter layer and is big and delicious!*  All in all, my boyfriend and I will definitely be back, if not for the delicious alcohol selection, then for our competitive nature with Trivial Pursuit!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome - I wish we had something like this in Vegas. It's a TRUE locals bar... it's super tiny and the owner (Greg) knows everything there is to know about the beers and wines they offer. His recommendation for what I wanted was spot on. Their happy hour is outstanding... my co-worker and I indulged in several beers among us and our bill was $36. Score! The place is fun and funky and Greg definitely has a passion for people and booze. Perfect qualities for a bar owner. :-) I would definitely return here when I'm in Phoenix. A cautionary note: food options are packaged and very slim so don't go when you're ravenous!"}
{"text":"This bar is totally awesome. Only cool people come here. Nice and intimate with fun games. Also entertainment. A great place for a date. Defiantly come here, parking is limited but you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Answer these questions:  1.  Do you like beer or wine? 2.  Do you like happy hour that last until 8pm!? 3.  Do you not care to have a big meal with your beer or wine? 4.  Do you like old school games (board and various)  THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!  Its new so I believe the staff consists of owners or family members.  The amount of beers and wines offered is vast.  Probably 40-50 of each.  Beers are can or bottle only, but since most are $3 during happy hour its awesome.  The food is the only downfall.  When I went the offerings were cheese and meat plate (2 options) and a ham and cheese sandwich.  I had the sandwich, it consisted of ham, cheese and bread.  However, it was $3, so I rolled with it and they use quality ingredients.    Go here for drinks with friends, but I can see it getting cramp if there is a crowd because it is tiny!  But, you can't beat the pricing."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend the Saturday before last and have been here 7 times since. By far my favorite new local bar. This vintage gem is everything a bar should be. It's very small, it has a gorgeous penny topped bar. The beer and wine selection is extensive and thorough. It changes every few weeks. It's a family owned bar, father and son. Greg  the head bartender is a pro on his beer and wine knowledge. Always excited to tell you what new selections he has. The expansive green chalkboard if full of choices that would quench anyone's palate. The prices are unbeatable for the high end beer and wine choices he offers. HH until 8pm daily, $3 beers and $5 glasses of wine. Greg's father Steve rocks a fedora nightly, and is always happily chatting up the customers and making you feel welcomed. Greg's sweet wife Chrissy is there pouring wine or making a freshly prepared charcuterie plate, dishing out a delicious brownie or a free Hershey kiss! It's just a wonderfully local, small business that will be getting my money for years to come. Get your asses down to the Whining Pig for a great time filled with good drink and great people!!"}
{"text":"Absent the sound of horns from yellow colored cabs and the hustle & bustle of passersby, The Whining Pig is a trip to a quaint and appropriately undersized NYC wine & beer bar.  If you're likely to complain that it's \"too packed\", then I suggest you play bocce ball or holey boards at a massive neighboring resto-bar and save the space for someone who appreciates the fact that you might actually have to talk to someone because you're literally rubbing elbows.  This is not the place to go for lunch or dinner, the focus is clearly on the well-selected wines and beers (a small, yet very well done cheese plate is available)- no Bud or Bud Light or similar will grace the chalkboard list.  The owner, Greg, is attentive and knowledgeable, and appreciates that you are there.  All that said, please don't go here because it's \"too packed\" and I'd rather have your seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Best place ever for happy hour!!! They offer $5 wine and $3 beer until 8pm, and are always packed. So many options for wine and beer, and such good company."}
{"text":"Super intimate.  Quirky board games.  And wine and beer! My kind of place.  If you don't really enjoy the person you're with--don't bring them here.  Also the free brownie they offered for a Yelp check-in was delicious, although it might have been the wine.."}
{"text":"A small bar with unbelievable beer selection, great bartender, fun games, and incredible music selections."}
{"text":"Great, low-key spot for an easy beer or glass of wine. Very small inside, which can be charming or cramped, and the parking lot is very tight and can be difficult to navigate."}
{"text":"I had heard this place was in the shopping center where TexAz was but really wasn't to sure exactly where.  So it took passing it a couple of times and a few U-turns to get to where I needed to be.  It is between a smoke shop and a salon on the further east end of that complex.  You walk in to a VERY cozy [i.e. small] bar area. with some unique 2 seat tables against the west wall and a penny topped copper bar, with stools immediately to the east.  [Yeah I love my cardinal directions.]  It is a tight squeeze but you quickly get to know your neighbors.  Good thing everyone I have met there has been pretty cool.  The wine and beer selection is pretty big considering it is a small place.  [Beer in bottles and cans, no taps if that is your thing].  The beer selection has a lil something for everyone from the standards like Coors Light and Blue Moon to craft beef selection that includes several AZ area favorites (and maybe some you have not heard of before).    Greg, his wife and father work to make this place what it is, a charming, fun place to hang out and meet some great people while drinking beer/wine.  You can catch a friendly game of Connect-4 or quiz your neighbor with a little Trivia while you are at it.  The Happy Hour prices are fabulous but the ambiance is worth it at any time you choose to come here.   They offer an ever developing cheese plate, select pastries and a few other little nosh items occasionally make an appearance on their chalkboard walls."}
{"text":"The Whining Pig doesn't look like much, and that's a good thing.  I went there with a friend, and we ended up pulling the Trivial Pursuit cards and just throwing random questions at each other while drinking tasty beers and chatting with the proprietor.    Overall, this place doesn't put on airs to be something it's not.  And that means something.  If I want fancy drinks, I'll look for a fancy drinks place.  If I am looking for a quiet place to drink good beer and relax, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best bar I've visited in a while. Diverse beer and wine menu. Attentive bartender. Lots of games to induce a fun nostalgia for the night. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm in the service biz.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  Love the small space and design.  I highly recommend.   Dale's Pale Ale in a can....good stuff!"}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews...and now I get it. Place is great. Bartender with a flair. Beer list is heaven. Wine is cheap and big pour. Sooo...going back. Great place/..wish I had dinner there vs paying overpriced meal for neighborhood place.  Cheers to the pig!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. You get the east coast, well established place feeling. Can't wait for their next location."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Very friendly bartenders, lots of fun games to play (Rock 'em sock 'em robots is awesome), and lots of choices for beverages (although no hard A).  It has a very cozy feel although that also can be somewhat annoying.  Seats here are limited, and even if you get a seat it will be crowded.  There is one small bathroom for everyone, and I accidentally walked in on someone who didn't lock the door.  Still, that's what gives this place it's charm is the how everyone is so close together.  Check it out for yourself. Also, you are bound to see some hipsters here :)"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this bar. The husband and I went here the other night to get an after dinner drink. The place was hopping on a Thursday night. We got a couple seats at the bar, which, as others have said, is really neat and completely covered in pennies. We came for happy hour and it is a mighty fine happy hour. Many many many beers for 3$ and an almost equal number of wines for 5$. The owner (?) was very friendly, perfect host, and had great suggestions and knowledge about his beers and wines. He introduced me to a raspberry wit called whitakerke rose.... awesome! He added a splash of champagne to it.... absolute perfection. He also encouraged us to play some games and brought them over (the bar has lots of board games, old schools games, and trivia cards). Additionally, with a Yelp check in we got a free buckeye.... this thing was good. very rich peanut butter and chocolate. Excellent! I will most definitely be back here in the future and suggest you check it out too."}
{"text":"Love this place! There is nothing better than grabbing a stool here on  a Saturday after noon and relaxing with a delicious glass of wine or two. The staff and the prices here are only outshined by their huge drink list. Reminds me of a cozy little bar in NYC."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am so glad I found it via Groupon. Since the Groupon, we have been back 3 more times. The owner always has good recommendations on the wine (selection changes). I've liked everything I have tried, and the owner will also let you taste something before you order. The service is excellent, I feel like every time I look up to contemplate ordering my next drink, there he is! There's no food, but the brownies are good - the peanut butter especially. My only complaint is that it is tiny. It can be hard to find seats on a Friday night. We have gone on Wed & Thurs and not had a problem though. I will keep coming back to this spot as long as it's here!"}
{"text":"Great place.  AMAZING beer selection.  Owner is real friendly and knowledgeable.  I am coming back"}
{"text":"I want to give this place one star so we can help keep the secret intact. But honesty is important, and I do have to say that our experience here on a Friday night (Valentine's, in fact) was super awesome.  We had not expected such a distinctively cool little place in a tiny strip mall. A bar covered in shellac'd pennies, chalkboard wine and beer lists covering the walls, tight seating but not so tight we couldn't find two empty stools right at the end of the bar.  Jovial servers (/owners), a great playlist, and Trivial Pursuit card boxes, plus random Valentine's candies, really made our experience stellar. Sadly, we were only visiting from Chicago; by the time we make it back to Phoenix, I'm sure we won't be able to get in the door.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend, cool selection of beers (not on draft). And the barkeep was friendly and made great recommendations.  Will definitely be back.  Wish they had more Food options."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place on a Saturday evening. They have really cool bartenders and an outstanding beer and wine selection. I love trying new beers and I never know what will be good. The bartender always gives me great recommendations and I've never been disappointed here! Also there's fun toys to distract you with and Cards Against Humanity!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe, great selection of appetizers and libations, the bar crew is cool and offers great recommendations, nice, intimate and quaint ambiance."}
{"text":"Teeeeny tiny bar!  Full of quirky touches like a fun chalkboard wall where you can leave your own artwork.  Also lots of games available like Operation, Cards Against Humanity, etc.  Located in the same center as TexAZ."}
{"text":"We went with a groupon. The bartender was friendly, funny, and helped me pick out a great drink. If you like games, come here. I even saw a copy of Cards Against Humanity in the back. That game is perfect with a few drinks!  If you want a huge selection of beer and wine and some decent food, give it a try. I didn't see any taps but the selection of bottles is so huge that I was happy just trying something new.  The specials are very fair. And while the chalk and wall can be intimidating I did not find it that hard to browse.  It can get crowded and parking can be difficult. But it is worth it to visit this nice hangout."}
{"text":"Very cool little bar. In the size of what would be a large closet is a great craft beer and wine selection. Service was great and they give you a ton to do. Vintage board games, good music, and friendly people. Will be back"}
{"text":"This glorious place and Trevor's glorious vibe made my Wednesday even better. Please enjoy this place just as much as I do once you find a seat."}
{"text":"Found this gem while spending some time in the Phoenix area.   Simple unbelievable. Excellent beer and wine selection. Very knowledgable and friendly staff that can answer any questions you have.  This is a small place so I wouldn't recommend going with more than a group of four.   I highly recommend hitting this place up during their happy hour. All beer is three dollars except a few select speciality beers that are either highly priced already or in larger bottles.  They also have different games at the bar that you can play with friends such as Connect Four, Trivial Pursuit, and Apples To Apples.  I do not have a single complaint about this place and whenever I'm in Phoenix again I will make it a priority to stop in."}
{"text":"This is a funky little hipster bar and I loved it!  Not sure if they only have beer and wine, but that's all I saw.  Beer selection was VERY good, but it was all cans and bottles, so if you are looking for a draft, this is not the spot.  The only downside I see to that is that you don't know how fresh their IPA's are, and that matters.    They have a grilled cheese menu which I would love to try, but we had dinner plans.   The BEST part about this place was the owner.  GREAT personality, fun, and focused on your experience.  It's a tiny spot, so I imagine it gets really busy at times.    Super reasonable."}
{"text":"Oh The Pig. Found this place tucked between  the TexAz grill and a palm reader . It doesn't get much more hole-in-the-walley than this spot.  Unless you live in a hostel its smaller than your living room. This is fantastic actually. It forces everyone to get to know one another. There are dozens of classic board games for your entertainment which is a definite highlight.   The beer selection is pretty out of this world and the bartenders are infinitely knowledgeable about the beer as well as the enormous wine selection. The beers are obviously hand picked which I appreciate. Its all bottles or cans which is a little tough but the selection more than makes up for it.   Staff is quick and eager to dig up something special. Do it."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  A nice hidden secret in the area.  Great Happy Hour and they let you wine test :)  They do not serve meals, but do have some great cheese platters and pasties. They have cool old school games, the bartender is fun and the music is jammable, if that's a word!"}
{"text":"We strolled into The Whining Pig in search of a good time and a nice atmosphere, and were far from let down! It's a nice, intimate setting with fun décor, great games, awesome staff, and a huge selection of beers and wines. They offer flights of wine suited to your tastes, and we could easily have spent hours in there! Also, the music is rockin. Definitely give The Whining Pig a try--you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Well here is the good:  They have lots of beers and wine.  The prices are okay.  Lots of games and entertainment.  The bad:  Only 3 parking spaces.  But they can only seat about 20 in this tiny closet so I guess it doesn't matter much.  Why do they have a TV on?  You can't hear it with the loud music?  The Ugly:  Some creepy looking customers in this place.  I suspect the ones who gave 5 stars, which is totally idiotic.  NO WAY.  3 stars top.  And since the owners keep taking my reviews off yelp I think I might go 2 stars next time."}
{"text":"Well it lived up to everything the reviews said.  The place is small but comfortable and plenty of seats around the u shaped bar. Great beer and wine selection.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and so are the patrons. Definitely a local's bar, though I was a tourist but felt very at home. Don't go for the food but if you want to grab a few drinks, then look no further. They have a lot of board games...including Rockem Sockem Robots!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny place, probably only a little bit bigger than my living room. It's got a cool vibe though, albeit a little bit hipster.  Seating is tight, friendly and limited.  There are games scattered across the penny-lined bar and the music is on point.  The green chalk wall has a list of several beers, wines and a few bites here and there.   Happy hour is almost like...all the hours they're open which is fantastic.  $3 beers. Anything from Coors to local Four Peaks to a pale ale called Monkey Knife Fight.  They've got a lot of stuff, something for everyone. ALSO THEY GIVE OUT CANDY. Soooo. Parking is difficult though, the only reason for the 4 stars and not 5. The lot is tiny and hard to navigate especially when it's peak traffic hours."}
{"text":"If you're trying to feel like you are sipping a glass of wine in a big city, this is your place!  The Pig has great specials throughout the day up until early evening and great prices all other times.  Truly a unique place with a very passionate staff."}
