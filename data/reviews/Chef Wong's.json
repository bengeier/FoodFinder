{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Markham. Food is excellent with reasonable portions and quality, service is very friendly. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I never expect food at chef wong is good.  I love their vegetables with deep fried garlic and booth.   The fish ball noodle is very good portion.  But their service is very slow that my in law needs to follow up for our orders every 15 mins"}
{"text":"At it is under new management , Well, after two years of staying away from Chef Wong, I saw a new sign and flowers which were sent ad part of the new launch in April.   So we thought we will give it a try....BAD idea!   We ordered yellow fin grouper fish with vegetables, BBQ meat, garlic steak ... For two people, we ordered the higher price food , the group was $26 a plate, but we thought it was okay.   Usually, with a new launch and a higher price dinner order, you get complimentary soup. I also observed other tables were getting these soups, and their Order did not seem to be expensive   The food was okay to good, but their portion is small.  The service however is not good. The servers never came by and we had to ask for everything ..  I don't think I will come back because they have enough regulars and certainly don't need our business"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 and I can tell you now we will never, ever step foot in this restaurant again.  The manager is also an owner and he is way too hands on.  He sat down at our table with half a glass of scotch while we were waiting for our other guests to arrive.  He was too talkative when really, all we wanted to do was read the menu.  Anyway, after the rest of our group arrived, we ordered dinner for six and a few other dishes.  The fish maw soup was watered down and tasted like green onion and ginger.  It had little to no fish maw in it.  The Peking duck was tasteless and the lettuce that accompanied the second dish was warm and limp.  We also ordered a side of clams in a black bean sauce.  The clams were over cooked and they were extremely difficult to eat.  We called over the manager, Phillip and he ARGUED with us!  We told him the dish needed to be replaced because it was overdone and inedible.  He said he cannot ask his chef to under cook it and we said that was fine.  We don't want that either,  we want it cooked correctly.  Not over and not under.  He looked angry.  He looked like a little old boy who was about to have a temper tantrum.  The mere fact that he argued with us was appalling.  Before we had even finished our dinner, a waitress came over to our table and asked us what we wanted to bring home with us.  I looked at her and said we're not finished eating!  Twice she tried to rush us out when we had only been dining for about one hour.  The restaurant was not busy and there were several empty tables.  All this on a Friday night.  Truly, this speaks volumes about this restaurant and perhaps we should have taken it as a warning to dine elsewhere.  As we were leaving the restaurant, the now visibly intoxicated manager/owner/Phillip approached me to state AGAIN the clams were cooked right.  He could not ask his chef to under cook as it would give us diarrhea (his exact words).  Seriously?  His breath reeked of alcohol.  His eyes were red and runny looking.  This man SHOULD NOT be in the hospitality business.    He is argumentive and cannot accept any criticism from the food that comes out of his kitchen.  The food is mediocre at best.  We will never dine here again.    With this manager being so hands on and so perfectly right, I give this restaurant another year before it closes its doors permanently.  I hope others will read this review any pay heed.  The manager is going to be the downfall of this establishment.  That and the fact the food is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Quality of their food is great and above the average Chinese restaurant in Markham. They've stepped it up big time since their days as Congee Wong thats for sure.  Price are very reasonable.  For those who weren't satisfied with their service, take it with a grain of salt and remember it's a Chinese restaurant.  Highly recommend this place for sureeee"}
{"text":"Used to be a Congee Wong ... frankly used to be one of the better Congee Wongs until the renovations.  Its a more modern look in decor like a Springrolls or a Congee Queen, which really makes it more generic if you ask me.  Perhaps they're hoping maybe they want more younger clientele would want to drop in with a more modern look...  Heres the thing change isn't always necessary, what they had going for it before the reno was they were a family/comfort food kind of place.  Very well lit, warm, friendly kind of dinner joints, whether 1pm for lunch or 1am for late night snack.  You could always get here any time of day and have a veritable feast on the cheap.  Plan of action would be to get a noodle or rice (that comes family sized) and many side dishes.  Unfortunately all the popular side dishs have prices of family sized dishes but are simply padded with a flower head sized pile of brocoli... like the fried shrimp in salad sauce.   Oh and when we ordered that dish, we first got a dish that resembled this with some kind of cantelope mayo (which was gross).  Don't get me wrong food and service here are great, but their side dish list has grown smaller and the prices have gone up.   There are too many changes here that have lost their magic for me.  Everyone has their go to never fail places for rainy days ... this used to be one of the few that I've been going to for over a decade.  Sadly its just another generic Chinese restaurant to me now in the sea of Congee Queens and Springrolls out there."}
{"text":"We went to Chef's Wong with a couple of our friends not long ago. The atmosphere is nice, cozy and bright. The service is probably the best thing about the restaurant. We were greeted right at the entrance and served well all through our stay. The food is ok but nothing spectacular. Spicy chili squid was probably the best dish while four other we ordered were just fine. Anyway, we'll give this place another try ..."}
{"text":"Previously Congee Wong, the food quality is much better than under previous name.  The food is very tasty, good seasoning, fresh, and good portions.  However, with our dinner tonight, it was difficult to enjoy as there were quite a few things in our food that made it difficult to eat.  From the shrimp with egg sauce, one person chomped on something looking like a small black pebble.  Showed the manager who explained that - 'that happens - farmed shrimp\".  Then from the BBQ for, there was another hard piece of something.  The salt and pepper calamari salad had another small hard piece of something was bitten on from the salad that comes with it and a  sharp bone was in one of the pieces of the calamari.  When the bone was mentioned to the manager, he quickly dismissed it and walked off.  They obviously are not cleaning or prepping  the food thoroughly.  With all these, it made it difficult for us to just enjoy the food without worrying about breaking a tooth.  I had previously stopped going to Congee Wong as the food taste and quality had gone down, so started going to Congee Queen.  After trying Chef Wong and really enjoying the food a few weeks ago, we decided to return.  After this, I think we will be returning to C.Q."}
{"text":"Fresh geoduck congee is pretty good, shrimp and chicken fried rice in cream and tomato sauce is also delicious. The food came pretty quick. Would always recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything is bad. The veggies are yellow. The meats and melon in the congee is bad. It took so long for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, better than we had hoped for. The owner came over and gave us the best guidance I have ever received in a restaurant. He steered us away from some things (stuff for the kids he thought would be too bland, and some of the more common dishes we always default to) and towards some things we had never tried before and absolutely loved. He even talked us out of ordering far too much! The service and food could not have been better and we hope to get back soon."}
{"text":"I believe this is a new restaurant replacing an existing one (or perhaps a name change?). I found the food here to be good, solid Cantonese food. Nothing fancy, of course, but some good classic dishes with a bit of flair, mostly congee, noodles, rice and or the sort.  I really enjoyed their meats (chicken, BBQ duck) so when I ordered the Hainanese stone pot rice, I was pleasantly surprised with it. I also ordered BBQ duck rice noodle in soup, which was good, but skimpy on the rice noodles? The price was reasonable, so I assume the portions reflect that. I ordered a side of yu choy ($4.50) to get my green veg on, but found that the entrees I ordered came with a few stalks of greens itself.  Overall, I would say come to this place for a quick bite in a small party, and you're just craving some generic, simple Chinese food."}
{"text":"Noooo! Where'd my Congee Wong go?  A group of us stumbled upon here, not realizing they had replaced Congee Wong.   We figured, Why not? We're starving, and in the mood for comfort food. And how could you screw up comfort food?   Between the 5 of us, we ordered: Lean pork, preserved egg and salted egg congee Spicy salt and pepper squid Salted Fish and Diced chicken fried rice Cantonese chow mein  Taste wise, it was pretty mediocre. The rice was sooo bland! For a dish I grew up with, that was hella disappointing.   Their portions don't do justice either. They're much smaller, compared to Congee Wong, Congee Queen or Mr. Congee.   The worst part was the price! Majority, if not all their dishes, are roughly 25% more than the prices at any other congee establishment. What's with that?! Especially for a location that replaced Congee Wong; you'd think the patrons would know, you've marked the entire menu up.   Cheap, fulfilling comfort food was not what we found.   Unfortunately, we won't be back. There's just much better."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for my wife and I for dinner. At first glance it seems as though we got too little food for our dollar, but once we open the food containers we realize that we paid for quality and taste over quantity.  The garlic stir fried gai lan (Chinese broccoli) was trimmed nicely, removing the thicker stems and shaving down the skin of the stems to reveal the tender core. I've never seen it done that way before. Each stem was laid out in a straight and orderly fashion, with a dusting of toasted sesame seeds on top. The quantity was about half of what you'd typically get at other places. I know, that's a lot of talk about gai lan! So what I'm getting at is you're paying for the effort on food prep and presentation, taste, and overall dining satisfaction.  The sweet and sour beef with onions was excellent. Nice tender beef with enough sauce to soak into white rice. The congee was great, not overly salted like some other places, but did have a peculiar gooey texture that made me think they used corn starch in the mixture to thicken things up. But otherwise the amount of preserved egg and pork bone meat was quite adequate. Nice!  Would we go back? Maybe... Sometimes we just want the quick and dirty Chinese food that's cheap and plentiful. But if we're after a higher quality take out, I would give this place another go.   Prices are above average."}
{"text":"No one brought us bill after we asked so we approached cashier to pay, left 10% tip at first, the cashier stopped me, grabbed my hand back and picked up coins from my hand. I guess she is just so good at math"}
{"text":"Ordered congee, was told no more congee left.  Ordered BBQ pork on rice, was told no more BBQ pork left.  Its only 9pm!? They are out of everything so why still operating?   Finally ordered fried rice, waited 30min for it while restaurant is getting empty.   One star for nice owner who offered us free appetizer while we waited for the longest fried rice ever made."}
{"text":"Came here late night and ordered beef short ribs, hot and sour soup, shrimp chow mein and they were all made with extra TLC.  Met the manager of Chef Wong's, really nice guy and always checked up on us to make sure everything was up to par which it was and more.  If you're in Markham I definitely recommend this place, you'll leave here happy and full."}
{"text":"This is my first review though I have used Yelp for a while now. We have gone to Chef Wong's a few times when we couldn't get into Ding Tai Fung two doors down and Chef Wong's was never packed or as busy as Ding Tai Fung and it's not hard to see why.  We love the garoupa at Chef Wong's and the past few times we had good food. Service was decent as the staff could barely speak English but I am Chinese so it isn't a problem. Today at lunch we ordered a chicken congee(\"Shatin Chicken Congee\") and when it came, we ate a little before we saw that the chicken(with bone in) was still raw and bleeding. We told our waitress, who calmly said it's just chicken blood as if we were overreacting. We have our 7 year old daughter with us and you can imagine our concern--salmonella anyone??  The waitress offered us an exchange so we took a plain congee, not wanting another raw meat fiasco again, which she brought to us with a smile.   Then the owner came over. Asked if I was Chinese, I said yes--and he turned to my husband who is French, and started to talk down to him--we must be used to KFC, this is Chinese and they use fresh chicken, etc etc. at that point I was a little mad and said, \"the chicken was still raw!\" And he did apologize, but we could feel the vibe all around.  There are congees in Chinese restaurants that use the heat of the congee to cook the raw sliced meat or fish/shrimp/seafood, but not with bone in chicken!! It would have been smart for them to apologize and exchange the dish instead of condescending on us like we were some uncultured barbarians. My father was a chef and my father-in-law was a French chef, I don't know any culture would serve raw chicken still bleeding at the bone(profusely, may I add) to the customers, and then chastise the patrons for not enjoying the culture of eating raw chicken!  Never again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner once and most recently for lunch.  It's nothing special but your typical Cantonese comfort food.  I can't remember specifically what we had for dinner but it was a fried rice and a fried noodle.  It was decent enough that I wanted to come back.  Lunch we had a beef brisket noodle soup and a wonton noodle soup with a side of fried spicy tofu (yummy), and rice noodle roll.    The servers were very attentive and friendly.    Will come back whenever I need my comfort food.  I think I actually prefer it to my neighborhood Congee Queen.  Feels less hectic."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as expected however, service was horrible. Having worked in customer service for over 15 years, it really irks me when people are rude and lack the basic knowledge of common courtesy. We came as a party of 30 plus people with reservations at 7:30pm and got kicked out at 9 with the waiter saying that our time was up. It was a family reunion, and the entire time there we did not feel welcomed. We were told constantly to \"hurry up and order\" and was given dirty looks when the kids got up off their chairs. It was busy which I had no issue with, but there should be no excuse for anyone to be rude especially in a place of business."}
{"text":"Chef Wong is wonderful!  The manager was attentive and truly cared about our opinions!  We ordered 4 dishes and they were all made fresh with quality and super super good efforts!  We had cantonese chow mein, hot and sour soup, beef ribs, and sweet and sour pork! They were all made with love and amazing flavors!    Come here for great chinese food and great attentive service! One of the best chinese restaurants in markam!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Man, this has been a long season. I finally have a chance to sit down and relax, and so I thought I would write some reviews.   This place used to be called Congee Wongs. It was a great place to get some congee, and it was always our go to place. It is still an ok place, but it isn't as impressive as before.   Looking at service, as it is a Chinese restaurant, I always expect it to be almost non-existent. I am happy to inform you that it is indeed non-existent. We sat there waiting for hot tea for quite a while. The person never came back and we just kept waiting. After a while, we would have to call and ask for it. They would take their sweet time.   The decor looks exactly like Congee Wong. It seems like they just changed the name. Not a good place for a first date, but it wasn't dirty or anything.   The food wasn't as good as Congee Wongs. The thing that we liked the most was the turnip cakes. Everything else, there was left overs. The deep fried donuts with rice something wrapped around it was soggy and a disappointment.   Overall, not a great experience, but it was ok. It was up to what we were expecting...nothing fancy and nothing crappy."}
{"text":"Ok, I came here hungry so this review may be a little bias. My brother and I decided grab dinner here because it was close to his place. I just thought I'd suggest Chinese food because I don't get to eat much of that now that I moved north. The food variety is the same as before the name change but prices have went up a little. The food taste the same as before and that isn't a bad thing. It's just the price I'm not cool with, though I understand the importance of running a business and inflation. The place looks cleaner than before and tables are laid out very similar. Service was also pretty good, very fast and efficient. I feel like they were nice to us because my niece was there too.. Lol  The food like I said is the same, so nothing special I can write about."}
{"text":"Being Cantonese and such, I'm not a big fan of going out to Cantonese restaurants because my mom always makes better food.  Congee places in the Markham/Richmond Hill are a dime a dozen, so it's hard to rate this any higher than 3 stars unless there was something superb.    We ate fried chili turnip patties, beef bone tomato noodle soup (I have no idea what it is actually called), and fish fillet congee with fried dough sticks and it came to a total of $26 tax in which was more than enough for two people.  I liked the fried chili turnip patties a lot because it wasn't too salty and had a good sweetness to it and they were perfectly grilled.  Congee was a good size and tasty as well.  In terms of the beef bone noodles soup, they were almost al-dente, which was great.  Service was your typical Cantonese style restaurant, not terrible, but not good either.    Verdict: Not a bad spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant my boyfriend's family and I ate at during our trip to Markham/Toronto and  was pretty close to the hotel we stayed at.   Chef Wong's is very spacious and has a modern decor and atmosphere. Although we came fairly late for dinner, there was still other families having dinner here too. The staff here didn't seem to be too on point nor enthusiastic and I guess it's probably because it's been a long day and late. The food was sadly mediocre and unfortunately, I wasn't able to take photos of what we had, but I do remember a few items we had and how I felt about it.  Seafood with Dried Garlic Fried Rice - I liked how it was shaped like a pyramid, but it did tumble down into a mess on the plate. Honestly, I felt the fried rice wasn't too special nor was it seasoned correctly. There was hardly any season or salt in it.   Angus Beef with Mushroom & Green Onion - I actually enjoyed this dish primarily because there were mushrooms in it and I love mushrooms! The Angus beef was cooked to just the right texture and savory!  Salted House Chicken - This dish was alright, not great because they gave us pieces that didn't seem to have too much meat on it.  Watercress Soup - I really enjoyed this soup and it taste just like the one my mom makes at home, except slightly saltier but not oversalted.  Overall, I felt the food was standard - nothing too fancy nor enough to drive me to want to come back here. I've definitely had better Chinese food in Canada. I think the service could be a little better. This isn't a bad restaurant to come to if it's near your hotel and your dead hungry like we were, but if your look for really good quality Chinese food I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents for lunch after browsing the plaza. It was pretty full and we had to wait a few minutes while they cleaned a booth for us. Service as a whole was a bit slow but nothing uncommon for a Chinese restaurant. A few of the serving platters had chips and nicks but over all food presentation and atmosphere was pretty nice.  The menu they gave us was freakin huge, thick and heavy enough to be a college text book. Highly doubtful that the chef would be able to make everything in the book delicious, we asked the waiter for suggestions and he recommended the beef riblets as well as the other bbq options. We ended up getting the lobster congee (we love seafood and I was still recovering from the under-cooked xiao long bao we had from Ding Tai Fung last night), honey bbq beef riblets, and duck tongue (was on a separate sheet of paper listing Chef Specials).  The beef riblets came first and man were they tasty. The beef was tender and well marinated, sweet but not too sweet. It was a bit difficult trying to chew the meat off the bone so do make sure to use the knife provided to cut the meat off. Next came the duck tongue which was pretty interesting. It had pieces of duck tongue stir fried with different colored peppers, asian mushroom and an asian veggie I don't know the name of. The duck was crunchy and well flavored. The dish as a whole had a little heat to it but was still very yummy.  It wasn't until after we were done with the beef and halfway through the duck that the lobster congee finally arrive. Might have been why the waiter was trying to convince us to get the seafood congee instead, the lobster congee came with a full, almost 2 lb, lobster cooked to order so the lobster was fresh (hence the long wait). It was very delicious and I would highly recommend it if you like lobster. We finished the whole thing, cleaning off the shells and everything.  All in all it was a very satisfying meal and we were happy with everything we ordered."}
{"text":"After their renovation this is the first time back. The service is very good and quick for everything you ask. The food is pretty good also. I would go back to eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food for the best price. I love that everything is so fresh and low MSG. The portion sizes are excellent for the price.I live in whitby and have no problem driving to Markham for some delicious, authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"My friends and I needed to grab a quick dinner before our movie. We were all craving Chinese food and thought Chef Wong's would satisfy our cravings. One of my friends could not eat meat for the day so we ordered mainly seafood and vegetables. Chef Wong's has a wide variety of selections on their menu. Their menu is quite colourful and extensive but it did not lose my attention. I think we wanted to order everything! My other friend and I actually wanted peking duck but we chose the 2 BBQ item combination as an alternative since it would smaller and our other friend couldn't have meat that day. I liked how this place had the full BBQ section for everyone to see and perhaps pick what they want. They also offer take out; similar to the Chinese supermarkets.  For our dinner, we opted for the following dishes: - Seafood Supreme Super bowl congee - Scrambled Egg White with Seafood - BBQ two item combo- Roasted duck and pork - Fried Rice Noodle with X.O Sauce  All the dishes were really tasty. The thing about the congee was it was tad too thick and we opted for the expensive seafood option with surf clam that was rubbery. We'll just stick with the regular seafood super bowl next time.  The service was fast and our food came quickly. Portions are great for sharing. At the end of the meal, we had a lot of left overs and it was great that the server packed our food- not a lot of restaurants do that nowadays...it did catch me off guard:)  I recommend this place if you want fair priced Chinese food and the location is great- right in the First Markham Place plaza."}
{"text":"My family arrived in this sprawling parking lot hellhole called First Markham Place in search of the fabled popular Ding Tai Fung restaurant, but found instead a long wait for a table. There are a gazillion other Asian food options in this confusing shopping centre for those not in the mood to wait, including the one conveniently right next door: Chef Wong's. There were plenty of seats at lunchtime here, and generally speaking we found this to be a decent choice if you wanna just eat but can't wait to eat and don't mind putting up with the horrible driving skills that seems to be the norm here to be here.  Apparently this used to be a Congee Wong--a familiar name in the Chinese Toronto suburban landscape. The basic clean contemporary decor is heavy in muted olive drab green tones, stuffed mostly with large group tables with diner booths lining the walls.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not experience any food or service woes. Service was at a basic satisfactory level, except for not having a host show up to seat us for a full minute.  We ordered mainly noodles from their overwhelmingly huge menu, generally around $7-10 each for a giant plate to share. Food comes damn quick, but overall I found them to be kind of an average kind of greasy Chinese comfort food like you'd find served in mall takeouts. The fried beef udon noodles for example, though I enjoyed it much like I enjoy a good greasy burger, was heavy on sodium and looked and tasted like it was slathered in Magi (the cheap man's fake soy sauce).  Anything here labelled as 'spicy' should be avoided by true chiliheads. We had also the Szechuan style beef rice noodles-and by Szechuan, they really meant more like \"dumbed down Szechuan style for whitey.\" Which of course meant a severely mild hot dish that suited my don't-like-too-spicy family, but would disappoint those craving authentic bold and hot flavours associated with Szechuan cuisine. That dish in question was also overloaded with a medley of peppers-of the red/yellow/green \"traffic lights\" kind.  {YRT/VIVA: once you get off the Purple/Pink line at Woodbine, you'll need a car to cut through the giant parking lot sprawl just to reach anywhere in First Markham Place}"}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Not even worth trying. Deserves less than 1 star Please do not go here and waste your money. Says grand opening but it has been there for over a year"}
{"text":"My friends and I were originally coming here to go to congee wong, to see it replaced by Chef Wong's. A little inebriated from a solid Yelp event earlier in that evening, we decided to try it out and see how it fared.  To our surprise, the food here was actually very solid. For 4 of us, we ordered the Hot and Sour soup, the seafood chow mein, sweet and sour pork, and BBQ short ribs. The portions were large, everything was hot, not overly greasy, and well seasoned. the non-greasy part is what really impressed me. Too often, chinese food is just dripping in cooking oil, which to me is unappetizing to see and taste.  All in all, I had no complaints about the food or the service. everything was spot on, and I would definitely go again if and when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service on a non busy day and time. Sat us down without even menus. Rice noodles were all broken up and beef stew was fat without beef. If it were not comfortable to sit, the food court at first Markham is multitudes better."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with family friends. This was our 2nd time. We had their special baked chicken, green pepper beef rice noodle, fried Taiwanese vermicelli, snow pea leaves with garlic, egg white with seafood and broccoli and dried scallop fries rice. For dessert we had the tapioca with coconut milk. Everything was delicious and not too greasy! The owner is very friendly and approachable and so are the staff!   Would go back and definitely recommend others to eat here!"}
{"text":"Chef Wong's, was once a Congee Wong. It has revamped and had a new modern and less broken down look. It looks much better and has a different look to the menu. There were some menus that were just in Chinese that I could not read, so that's always useless when I walking into those types of Chinese restaurants. Generally Chef Wong's has the same types of items as the Congee Wong, but seems less greasy. It's a nice change from what the Asian food motto  usually is,\"Add Oil, Add Oil!\" Although the grease always makes the food taste so much better at times. The service is your typical Chinese place, pump customers in and out as fast as possible when it's busy. It's your typical place for decent priced Chinese food. I would come back when I feel for less greasy asian food. Jimstar Out!"}
{"text":"Walked pass this place and noticed it has a new identity.  Went right in and gave it a shot.   We had two lunch set; congee with pork liver and meat ball and bitter squash, chicken with flat rice noodles.  The congee came with fried dough; and the noodle came with soup and drink.  The pork livers were thick and juicy.  The meat balls were tender.  The congee was a bit too thick though.  The noodle was delicious and not oily at all.  The pork liver was so good that I went there two days later and had pork livers with noodles.  The pork liver had the perfect thickness, it's well cooked and yet tender!   It's full of meaty juice and that's what you want in a perfectly cooked pork liver.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last Sunday.  We ordered a stirred fried noodle and a BBQ Pork.  The BBQ pork was average, in that it was a little bit better than grocery store quality and a little bit below a good BBQ store.  I think the BBQ Pork at Congee Queen is better.  The stirred fried noodle was not properly seasoned.  I sprinkled salt on it myself.  I think there are too many menu selections, to the extent that the chef may not know how to make all of them well.    Most notable was that it took a long, long, long time for the food to arrive.  I saw many people sat idle, staring blank and waiting.  The servers worked at super speed, like a train engine.    If the food can arrive faster, Chef Wong's is 3-starred for lunch.  Otherwise, it is 2-starred for lunch.  My average lunch hour is only 1 hour after all."}
{"text":"I had an afternoon tea special Guilin Rice Noodle with milk tea for $5.75.  It was pretty good, along with other dishes I have had in the past.  The location has changed names several times in the past.  Still has good selection of chinese food and friendly staff.  The lady at the front cash seems grumpy though, need some cheering up."}
{"text":"After reading reviews figured I'd give it a shot  Ordered   Cantonese Chow Mein and hot and sour soup my usually order (28.76$ total)  Waste of money the 7.99 hot and sour soup from ding tai fung is 100x better  The chow mien smelt fishy and noodles were cooked in old grease I wouldn't complain if it was much cheaper   But for 30$ was way below my expectations I defiantly will not Be back much better restaurants in that plaza"}
{"text":"Here's my usual weeknight dinner with mom up in her hood :) by that, our choices are mostly within FMP (First Markham Place).  Again we are looking for a place with a few small dishes, a bowl of soup and steam rice.  I, on the other hand, wanted to try a new place so we ended up here ... Where it used to be Congee Wong. Upon arrival I found the services to be superb. They would come over and suggest their today's specials (usually not the case at smaller Chinese restaurants), and really come by to check on you throughout he dinner. We ordered two dishes, fried spring chicken and tofu casserole both are very well delivered.  Prices are very fair as well! This place deserves a 4 stars!  Highlight of the visit: services  Food (Taste): 4/5 Food (Presentation): 4/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 - very clean :) Fun Factor: na/5"}
{"text":"2.5 star  Chef Wong's is a new Chinese Restaurant that replaces Congee Wong in First Markham Place.  Interior has been totally renovated but still keeping the similar colour theme of green.  Menu is quite similar congee and noodle but with additional of more Cantonese stir fried dish which are good for dinner.  Cuttlefish Ball with Vermicelli in Fish Soup ($5.95), I am not even sure if it was fish soup as it lacked the fishy smell and taste. The vermicelli though cooked well with a good bite. Portion size though a little small as I can probably eat 2 bowls of those as snack. Loaded with MSG...I was so thirsty afterwards.  Service though was really friendly and courteous.   No Afternoon tea special offers.  Just be really careful as the floor is really slippery.   I might come back to try out other items. Not a bad option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"The staff are really nice and the food was indeed less oily than usual, but I felt that their dishes were very lightly seasoned. I'm just the type of person who loves having different flavours of sauces and spices when it comes to Chinese cuisine, but my visit just did not exceed my expectations.  I had a full sized lobster and it tasted very fresh- many people ordered it too so I strongly recommend it. I also found their vegetables tasting quite nice."}
{"text":"Used to be called congee Wong - change of ownership and now is called chef wongs.   That didn't really change much. The seating is very cramped for the lounge tables. Sitting two average sized individuals together feels like the middle seat in the back of a small car.  Can't move in the seat - really reduced the quality of the experience.  As compared to it's competitors value proposition of fast service, cheap and quality food - they can't compete. Food took 20 min to come and was undercooked. They heated it up but by that time I was frustrated and really hungry.   Decent presentation of food, however the plate was dented with too many nicks.  The manager is really into the business but that doesn't make a difference.   Overall, not up to Chinese food standards. Go back to congee queen."}
{"text":"Food was fast and hot. portions weren't as much as you would expect but the service was good and the waiters were friendly. price wise was ok"}
{"text":"I live near by First Markham Place and have been to this restaurant several times since it re-opened as Chef Wong's.  The food is better than before with a menu that includes more seafood dishes.  It seems a bit more pricy but it's worth it  because of the difference in quality.  Everything I've had there is yummy. I would highly recommend this restaurant.  We also visited the new Congee Wong on 16th Ave and Spadina, and the food there was not very good.  The dishes lacked flavour and they tasted like they were cooked in a microwave oven."}
