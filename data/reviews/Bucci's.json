{"text":"The sauces are all homemade! This restaurant and the family feel are just amazing. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. My husband had the meatballs and they are so tasty we took 4 more to go. We go here at least once a week. The staff and food are one of the best I've ever had! Try it, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite veal parm, and my mom loves the cavatelli.  It's an old-school, hole-in-the-wall place in a strip mall, but the food is much better than what you would expect from that description.  The ambiance is not, now that they have a giant TV blasting opera concerts at tremendous volume."}
{"text":"Bland food and exorbitant prices has now ruled Bucci's out for me. My $18 dish of pasta and broccoli was drowned in 1\" of an oil water mixture. Bland and disappointing.  The other odd thing about this place is they have two huge tvs playing in a tiny space. Distracting and kind of annoying."}
{"text":"My gf had the cavetelli. I had lasagna. Both were very good. The salads were refreshing and their Italian dressing with red vinegar had the proper amount of vinegar so add not to overwhelm you like many other restaurants.  Took a small pep & sausage pizza to go. The pizza had good Italian sausage and joins only three other restaurants (Frankie's, Angie's, Barbarino's) that I order Italian sausage on my pizza.  My Italian gf had long been familiar with Bucci's as it's perhaps her favorite. This was my first visit and I have to say, well done!"}
{"text":"I think it's sad what a horrible abrasive waitress we had there. Told us if we ever stop talking we can order. This place is the same as Carrabas honestly. It is nothing special but will never go back after tonight."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?? The only reason why this joint is in business is for two reasons. One Italians go here and two people from Cleveland NO NOTHING ABOUT FOOD regardless if it is Italian or any other crap they serve in this town. Sit in a booth to pay these farmers big money. Three of us $94.00 with a 20% tip. Get this junk out of here. BRUNO'S by far blows any of these want to be Italian food joints away. Yes and Frankies sucks in Westlake and North Olmsted. Now this place Bucci's is for SUCKERS. Are you one of them? Are you over 45 years old bowing your head in this joint?Go ahead sit in a booth like a clam and pay over priced for garbage. You want good Italian food here in the city==BRUNO's or go to New York city. Bucci's is a lamb and for suckers of Ohio. Go ahead, sit in a booth like a pigeon. Screw THIS JOINT!!! OVER RATED PRICES and garbage food! It is a over-rated joint that is hyped by people of Cleveland/Northern Ohio. Go ahead and sit a booth to get over priced food, you deserve it!!! And the farmers clog up the parking lot to get in to eat the garbage so Ican't get my dry cleaning clothes. What a joint this is... Put your name on list for garbage!!!"}
{"text":"Best Marinara sauce in known universe.  Hearty portions;  Very good service.  Great family place."}
{"text":"Totally old school.  You can't pass up homemade cavatelli with marinara sauce.  The meatball are good, too.  House Italian dressing on the salad didn't disappoint.  The garlic butter with the basket of bread was so, so good.  Very good service with a smile and a family-friendly atmosphere.  Will definitely go back and join the other regulars!"}
{"text":"My wife and went their for the first time yesterday. Food was excellent. The service too though they were busy . Chicken parm excellent as the blush rigatoni. Nice surprise for a city that had sub par places to eat!  Only complaint was my wine was warm?  Odd. We are coming back as soon as I can afford the calories!!!"}
{"text":"Love everythng we ever order here! Wait staff is great! A true family gem!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend received a Bucci's gift card so we decided to make use of it this evening.  I had been there before, and I seem to recall lackluster gnocchi, but I was hoping for better results this time around.  The experience was worse.  First, I had forgotten that the place is located in a strip mall on Hilliard in Rocky River, so it almost feels like you're about to step into a Geppetto's walking through the door.    This might be forgiven if the food were authentic or otherwise decent, but it is not.  My spaghetti tasted like it had come from a cafeteria, and the cheese ravioli came out as grainy.  My girlfriend had the pasta primavera, which was tasteless.  We both agreed that we could have cooked better pasta at home (which my girlfriend just reminded me is saying a lot, since I never cook).  The mediocre meal was not that bad of a deal, though because we had the gift card...until we were told that we couldn't use ours.  Our server informed us that she had no way of knowing how much was on the card, so she couldn't take it.  I asked to speak with the owner and she gave the same lame excuse.  An argument ensued in which the staff kept vacillating between the \"we're not a participating restaurant' (despite no apparent mention of this on the web site)  and \"we would take the card but we don't have the ability to do so\".  After I continued to protest for some kind of recompense, the staff suggested that I call the number on the back of the card...which did not exist so that they might verify how much was on the card.  I think they got the \"you want me to do what?\" message, and finally one of the servers graciously agreed to make a call to verify the card's amount so that she could run the card.  I gave Bucci's 2 stars for having mediocre food and not completely stiffing me on the gift card (even though I had to work in order to get them to accept it at all)."}
{"text":"Food is awesome.  My husband says the cavatelli is the closest he's ever had to his Italian grandma's who made it homemade all the time.  Sauces are delicious.  Only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because the wait is often long to get a table (place is small) and food takes a while to come out.  But if you have the time or can go at an odd hour, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Nothing better than homemade sauce. My girlfriend recommended this nice  quaint little place. What a great surprise. Had the mussels and lasagna. She had the wedding soup and salad. Dipped the mussels in the sauce and they were fantastic. Lasagne is my judging dish. Needless to say it was fantastic. Looking forward to returning to try the other items.  The service was great. Informative and a delight."}
{"text":"WEnt here for the first time with our family last weekend.  Everyone was very happy with the food and the services was impeccable.  It's a standard Italian food joint, been around forever, and still have the owners or their family around.  Chicken Parm was great and so was spag and meatballs.  Pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Eye-talian food. You know, lots of red sauce, lots of familiar dishes, very good meatballs, solid pizza... maybe even a glass of Chianti served out of something with a future as a candle holder. I'm a fan of their pizza, stuffed peppers, and especially their longtime waitresses. It's all good stuff cooked in the classic Italian-American tradition. The dining room is relatively small, and a wait is not uncommon during popular dining times. The place tends to attract a mix of an older clientele and young families, so it's not surprising there are so few reviews. People love it, and I can see why."}
{"text":"Good food, marinara is great on wheat penne with meatballs. Reasonably priced. Mussels were good."}
{"text":"I've been to this Buccis location several times and have always had great food and excellent service. I have had the lasagna, cannelloni, veal and chicken picattas. All were excellent.  Flavorful and large portions on all my selections. Even the salad that accompanies the meals was really good. If you like bleu cheese ask for crumbled bleu on the salad - you won't be disappointed!  Our waitress's are always friendly and quick. Heck, Kevin Costner ate here while on town filming a movie so it has to be good!  If I have a complaint it's that the waiting area is small so when they are busy. It's a tight fit."}
{"text":"This place is small and smells fantastic when you walk in the door. HOWEVER, I simply ordered cavatelli with meat sauce, simple right? Well, I guess they feel customers like their pasta look like soup. Noodles swimming in sauce. It was terrible. The only thing that was good was the bread and garlic butter. Extremely overpriced and service was not great. Packed house with two servers. Makes no sense. I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We decided to go to for a family dinner tonight and wanted to get pizza. After being turned away with an hour wait at the new Mellow Mushroom in Rocky River, we decided to give this Bucci's location a chance and I'm glad we did.   I must say, I felt like I was in the Sopranos when I walked in. It's actually a tiny one room restaurant. You are close to everyone, and can see the whole floor which was quite interesting and nice to be honest. With the laughter of the patrons and everyone seeming to be having a good time, it really felt like a great family location.   It smelled great when we walked in and we were seated quickly. Every table in the place was taken (although there is only about 15 tables) and there were 2 servers working their butts off.   We received complimentary bread with garlic butter which was nice. We had a calamari appetizer that my 3 year old son devoured. The marinara sauce and sweet sauce that accompanied the calamari was wonderful.   My son and I split a pepperoni pizza that was AWESOME. My only gripe would be that it could use more cheese but to be honest that did not matter as the crust on this pizza was exactly how I would want my perfect pizza's crust to be. It was almost like a pan thin crust. I would definitely recommend the pizza!  My lady ordered the Chicken Parm and it was HUGE. 2 large breast drenched in cheese and sauce with a side of rigatoni marinara. It tasted great and was more than enough for 2 meals.   Our server was an older lady who was very sweet. It would have been nice if she would check on refills for drinks a little bit better but I'll admit she was very busy.   I will 100% be back mainly to get takeout pizza but I did enjoy my dinner at this establishment and will be back to sit down again as well."}
{"text":"Never eat here! The worst customer service in earth! And the food is not awesome. Also they will not honor gift cards purchased on THEIR website that state they can be used at the Rocky river location. I wouldn't send a bum here .  I have eaten all the United States , I'm from Texas , and never in my life I have I had such terrible terrible interaction with a restaurant .  They should have purchased a computer to take the gift cards they sale  instead of several flat screen TVs that belt out the four tenors so loud you can't even talk to the people at your table .  Save your money - go to Olive Garden at least they are consistent ."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, wonderful food and a friendly staff. If you're looking for traditional, home cooked Italian, I highly recommend Bucci's. Order anything with the tomato sauce or the blush sauce, both are to die for. I recommend Cavatelli as a pasta dish or the Chicken Prosciutto if you're looking for a protein dish.  It's always a safe bet to get the delicious meat balls added to any order. Easily 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I really couldn't say enough about the food!!! I will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Bucci's is a great little Italian restaurant- if you know what to order. The mozzarella sticks and fried calamari are always good, as are the chicken parmesan and the linguini with clam sauce.  Other than that, it's kind of a toss up. I would check reviews on here to get an idea of the other menu items and if they're good or not.  The restaurant itself is very small and can seat around 50 people. It can feel a little cramped at times, and on some nights it's very hard to get a seat. Nothing overwhelming.  Bucci's is a great place for takeout, so if you're considering trying it for the first time but don't want to sit in a tiny restaurant, I'd highly recommend ordering out!"}
