{"text":"Yep, it was pretty good. The dumplings were by far the best I've ever had. They also take credit/debit as well as cash, which was really convenient. Right in the heart of Chinatown. We got a plate of pork dumplings each, and were pretty pleased with our last minute dinner decision. Would recommend to dumpling snobs."}
{"text":"Great fried dumplings! Lots of choices for those that enjoy them fried or steamed or in soup. Quick service. Well worth the walk to China town. Only wish there was one this good in London, Ontario."}
{"text":"Love it there. The pork shrimp coriander dumplings are exceptional. The wasabi salad is perfection . The service is ok, but the food is a winner. Simple and delicious."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Go here. We liked the steamed dumplings over the fried, but all were really good. The tomato and egg one was surprisingly delicious."}
{"text":"Pour moi, les meilleurs dumplings à Montréal.  Essayez les dumplings au porc/coriandre."}
{"text":"The dumplings were quite good, but the service is beyond terrible. The restaurant was basically empty and they have yet place us at the worst possible table in the restaurant. I do not understand their logic much. There were also no napkins on our table. Despite asking, we never got any, and we had to wait a while until we got a refill on the water. In the end, I had to take napkins from another table...  And then the moron of a server was upset about not getting a good tip despite not doing her job properly.   I used to be a regular customer, but that cut it for me. I will look elsewhere for my dumplings from now on."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"hole in the wall\" type of places; but don't let its exterior fool you, it is one of the best Dumpling restaurants I've ever had the pleasure to visit. Great service, a very diverse menu with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Pork and Cabbage dumplings were amazing, I'd get those over the beef and coriander soup dumplings, but perhaps only bc you get more dumplings sans soup. (Soup was good!) very busy place with locals, a good sign"}
{"text":"I went last weekend with big expectation. However, both food quality and restaurant service are so disappointment. The restuarnt is too small and too crowd because there are many tables in this tiny place. Besides, the restaurnt is freaking cold (only one door, you can image  how cold it is in Montreal winter time especially when people come in N out)  It took us 10 mins to make an order (b/c there is only one waiter) and 30 mins to get dumplings.   We ordered one boild dumpling and one deep fried dumpling. I dont know why so many people recommend the dumpling. The boiled dumping wrapper is TOO THIN and TOO SOFT . The good dumpling wrapper is supposed to be not too thin, not too thick and chewable.  However, this boild dumpling skin taste like frozen dumpling cooked too long time?The skin is too puffy and too soft. The filling is average . The deep fried one is better.  Honestly, I ate better homemade dumplings than here. Not recommend."}
{"text":"Such good dumplings!  Coming from a northern Chinese and her mom, who makes homemade flour-based food all the time!  Each plate comes with 15 dumplings, around $8, extra $1.5 for pan fried ones. We had the pork, soybean, and carrot ones, as well as the tomato egg, both boiled. Both sound odd but great!  Strongly recommend it.   They're popular and busy, the server forgot one of our dishes, which was fine since we were full from two plates of dumplings.  It's kind of a hole in a wall but that's the beauty of it. If I lived in Montreal, I'd eat here often, and my mom would apply to be a dumpling maker!  Dined here 24 June."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I wanted to give this restaurant a 4.5 rating but couldn't do that. The only reason I would knock it down half a star was for the ambiance and set up. It's pretty cramped and the tables and chairs were practically falling apart. There are these door shutters when you walk in that seem really odd and kinda weirded me out. So that's my only complaint about the place. But once you get past the decor and wobbly chairs...the food is outstanding!  We tried it because it had so many amazing reviews on yelp. And it sure didn't disappoint! The main complaint we had was that we were too full to try more!!!  We went around 12:30 on Saturday and we were seated right away and served hot tea, which was nice. We ordered what was recommended by many here: the cucumber salad, the celery salad and then the beef and curry fried dumplings and then shrimp, egg and leek fried dumplings. Everything came super fast...like less then 15 minutes total. The salads were shockingly amazing! They didn't look like they would be....but honestly...so so so good! Then the dumplings were next level! Especially the shrimp and leek. The flavours were out of this world!!! I personally preferred them much more then the beef and curry. They were still great but a little overpowering on the curry.  Overall, we were super impressed with this place and would eat here again in a heartbeat!   Tips: bring cash. They don't take credit or have an ATM. Hubby had to go next door."}
{"text":"Will be a habit whenever in Montreal.  Get tea and a variety of dumplings (steamed and fried) and reorder what disappears until all dinners are satisfied.  Might good to avoid at prime time unless you are OK with a long wait."}
{"text":"D E L I C I O U S !!! Looks shabby but worth the trip ! We tasted a few of them both boiled and fried and they were all excellent. My fried favorite was lamb/onion while the boiled porc/shrimp/cilantro flavors burst in my mouth... Red meats and stronger flavor seem to benefit from frying while boiling brings out the fresh smell of coriander, mushrooms, leeks and shrimp. The wasabi based coleslaw was excellent as well. All this for a few $$. A must go !  D E L I C I E U X !!!  Ça paye pas de mine mais ça vaut le détour ! On a goute plusieurs et tout était excellent ( frits ou bouillis). J'ai adoré mouton /oignon frits et porc/crevettes/coriandre bouillis. La friture fait ressortir le gout de la viande rouge tandis avec le porc/crevettes bouillis on sent plus les parfums. La salade choux / carottes / wasabi est délicieuse aussi. Tout ça pour qq $..."}
{"text":"It tastes so good~ it is the best dumplings I have in Canada.  and the owner is really nice ~"}
{"text":"Well..... I bookmarked this place for a while, went today, and will unbookmark after this review :(  Long story short, it's a basic place, dumplings were ok/good but we discovered a *really* long black hair among the steamed dumplings (I'm blonde). Lost my appetite.. Waitress was apologetic and her service was good... but kitchen should do a little quality control (it was not crazy busy at all)  The dumpling places on Lincoln and Ste Catherine better .  Sorry! :/"}
{"text":"Wow, wish I could round up these dudes and transplant them in DC.  Best dumplings ever.  I think they serve other stuff, but dumplings are it.  Everyone there ate dumplings.  From the small, cozy dining area, you can watch a team making fresh dumplings through a window to the kitchen.  And cheap, really cheap, like $8 for a huge plate of them.  I think we rolled with a number 10 and number 19.   One was steamed or boiled, with soft finish that glided down your gullet.  The other was fried, crispy, spicy, damn, both were great!  I'm trying to cut down on carbs, but I'm tempted to go back for another round.  Thumbs Up."}
{"text":"Never having had a dumpling before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The interior decor was a step above what I expected. There was a TV with Chinese TV playing. I ordered the beef onion curry dumplings. The waiter recommended that I order them fried (as opposed to boiled), so I trusted his recommendation. I was expecting the dumplings to be deep fried (and in fact was feeling guilty for not having worked out that day) but was pleasantly surprised to see that they were only lightly pan fried on one side, so the frying wasn't too overpowering. The dumplings were simple yet very delicious. One plate filled me (I was dining alone) but I could easily see how you could order a couple of plates and share. You can also see the kitchen where they make the dumplings from the dining room."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem about 3 years ago when they first opened. It doesn't have a flashy exterior so it's easy to keep walking by but DON'T ! Stop, turn and walk in.  Have some tea, place your order and enjoy the dumplings. Having lived in China for over 5 years (no, Hong Kong doesn't count)  I can say their dumplings are every bit as good.  Prices are reasonable for what you get. Service can take some time because the dumplings are made fresh on the spot.  I don't get why reviewers are complaining about this?! I would much prefer freshly made instead of out-of-the-freezer dumplings that sit around for who knows how long.  This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"I wanted to switch it up from the usual Qing Hua so I made the detour here. The dumplings were fine enough but the overall lack of cleanliness made me cringe. Maybe take out would be better, at least that way you can turn a blind eye?"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to this. The location very was difficult to find as their sign is above a different building. The restaurant is really located under the sign of a smiling dumpling, not under the sign that says Mai Xiang Yuan. I like trying little places like this, and because of the reviews I had high hopes, but these dumplings sucked. Also the women making the dumplings weren't wearing any gloves. I know this is fairly common at small places like this, but it is always a speck unnerving when you see a cook who doesn't bother with basic sanitation standards. I ordered the beef and coriander and the pork with shrimp. The beef dumplings were burnt so I started out with the pork. They were very bland and fairly greasy. The chili oil didn't have any heat to it which was another letdown. The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the portions are big, but that doesn't really matter if the food sucks. Wouldn't recommend, wouldn't go here again, and I regret having put as much effort as I did into finding this place."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall but friendly and efficient service with fresh dumplings.  I got take-out as it was super hot day and our hotel was not too far.  Being a dumpling expert... I can say that they are super fresh and tender with good quality pork filling accompanied by lightened soy sauce.  However it would have been a 5 star if they added a little grated ginger to their sauce and water chestnuts or just a tad something to their dumplings.  If I lived here I would buy them everyday but I live in New York, and can make my own so it's not the best I had but pretty damn good.    I didn't try the sides and wish I had..."}
{"text":"Best Dumplings I ever had. Plus free tea! who doesn't love free tea :)  Restaurant is extremely small.... approximately 12 tables. The kitchen is partially open and lets you view the people making the dumplings.   Menu is ONLY dumplings and cold appetizers. Don't go if you don't enjoy this kind of food!  I had the steamed Pork and Cabbage dumplings and the Beef and Curry dumplings.  The beef and curry were good but not great.... i took them because the previous reviews said they were amazing. They are served pan-fried and taste a lot like indian food.... kinda odd for a chinese restaurant.  The pork and cabbage dumplings were amazing :) I loved them and could have eaten more.  The plates are 15 dumplings each. So the more people the better if you want to try different flavours.  Overall great place! Try it once and you'll be hooked.  Great place to have dinner as well as lunch."}
{"text":"We agree with the other reviewers that Restaurant Mai Xiang Yuan in Montreal's Chinatown serves superb dumplings. We ordered four different types: lamb/cilantro, egg/leeks/dried shrimp, beef/mushroom, and shrimp/pork. All were fresh, hot, and delicious. Dinner for two w/tip was less than $30. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Petit endroit perdu au milieu de tous les autres restos en apparence identiques du quartier chinois, j'imagine que c'est le bouche à oreille qui opère pour se retrouver ici!   L'endroit est petit, tables assez rapprochées, mais invitant. Le roulement semble bon, car quand nous y sommes allés (7h un samedi soir) une table nous a tout de suite été assignée et les gens ne cessaient d'aller et venir (ce qui habituellement est assez bon signe).   Dumplings, dumplings, dumplings, le choix est varié c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire! Chaque assiette en contient 15, donc c'est intéressant d'y aller à plusieurs pour essayer différentes sortes. Le prix est très modique et la fraîcheur de la nourriture incroyable, avec les dumplings préparés à la minute sous vos yeux.   Personnellement, nous avons essayé boeuf & oignon au curry (juste assez épicé à mon goût et bien juteux attention à vos convives lol) puis porc, coriandre et crevette. Goût de coriandre parfaitement balancé, c'est juste assez moelleux en bouche. Parfait! A essayer sans hésiter"}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy some dumplings. ....  Place is small. Good for a group of max 4-5. Friendly staff and fast delivery..  I went with my gf while checking out China town. When we walked in, the place was full and had to wait for few mins. Seems like a family run place..decor and atmosphere are okay not fancy...  Menu is simple and ranges from 5-9 for 15 dumplings...and salads r 1-1.50..yes its max one dollar  I tried the wasabi salad..Awesome...then beef and onion dumplings...shrip+pork+ coriander dumplings...so far the best I tried...and waiting for the food was max 5- 10 mins..   A great place and will definitely go back 100%  Place is authentic dumplings. ..u only get dumplings there not like some other places where u get fried rice to sushi. ..  I been to many places and never bothered to write review so please lemme know if this helps. ."}
{"text":"Environ une quinzaine de Dumplings pour douze dollars avec les taxes et l'extra pour les faire frire. Ceux au boeuf et coriandre sont très bons. Thé inclus."}
{"text":"Best dumplings ever. Super affordable (about $10 Canadian for 15 dumplings of any kind). You can get them boiled or fried, and they have a huge selection. It's all business, zero atmosphere, but if you like authentic Chinese dumplings, this is it. I like the Leek, Pork & Shrimp. Cash only."}
{"text":"So good.  There are beef, pork, seafood, vegetarian and lamb dumpling dishes, so something for everyone. They are about $8-10 each. Each dish contains 15 dumplings, unless indicated otherwise. For $1.5 extra, you can have them fried. Otherwise, they're boiled (which is much healthier).  Each dumpling has the perfect amount of filling. You might burn your mouth so be very careful, but the right way to eat it is to pop the whole thing in your mouth so that you get all the juice, as opposed to the juice being wasted on your plate. The dumplings didn't have too much fat, which I appreciated; they use fresh, lean ingredients. Although it's common sense, but be careful, it's hot, and the juice might scorch your tongue or the roof of your mouth.  Order a salad to go with your dumplings ($4 for cucumber salad); it will really refresh your mouth after each dumpling, ready to take on the next dumpling.  A lot of locals come here; alone, in pairs, families or groups. Doesn't matter if you come alone or with people, as the atmosphere is very inviting."}
{"text":"Good dumplings, though I wouldn't say they're the best ever. We enjoyed boiled, fried and soup dumplings. If you're looking for good and don't want to dent your wallet, this is the place. I'd suggest the owner try to keep the place a bit more clean... Just getting the grime off the windows/doors could improve the overall eating experience for patrons."}
{"text":"They finished renovating the place but it used to be a small overcrowded hallway-like room. However it doesn't really matter since people don't come here for the ambiance or the decor. Everyone's there for the food.  The price is low, the portions are huge and the pork dumplings I got were filling and tasty. Just that would normally warrant 5 stars, however, coming from an asian background, this restaurant didn't quite meet the standards I'm used to, but it was still a very valid effort. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I was shocked at how good the dumplings for the price. Being from New York, I have had the best and worst dumplings around. Next time I go to Montreal, I'm coming here again. You should too."}
{"text":"I went there with some coworkers for a quick lunch. Sevice was usually good and quick, but this time it took more than 40minutes to get our dishes. The waiter served all the other tables before ours even though we had ordered before them. He also gave us the wrong dish and even if i mentionned it to him, he still charged us for the wrong dish after acknowledging his mistake. Worst experience and service I ever had!!!!! And it's not even because of the rush, the waiter was casually talking in the kitchen, knowing that he had a table that was not served. Would definitely not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was entirely empty and they still took over 20 minutes to get a plate of dumplings. I had eaten about 5 before I realized they had gotten my order wrong which I went up to tell them. Instead of apologizing, she insisted that it was what I had ordered. I knew it wasn't because I literally never order dumplings with the ingredient (egg) and asked them to change it. Most restaurants would be really apologetic, change your order, and let you keep the extra right? Not this place. The waitress took the original dumplings away which I wouldn't have cared about had she not complained about me in Chinese very loudly as she did it (guess she thought I didn't speak it.) Avoid this place. The Chinatown location is much better and your waitress doesn't bitch about you in Chinese."}
{"text":"Simply the most outstanding dumplings my family has ever had. They should know as that is their favorite Chinese dish."}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal Sunday around noon and took to Yelp to find a good spot for lunch. As we quickly found, we're staying right across the street from Chinatown. With the advice of the Yelpers we went here for what were supposed to be amazing dumplings (spoiler: we were not disappointed).   It was busy, but a table opened just as we arrived. The service is lacking, but this is a really casual place and we weren't in a hurry. We ordered #20 boiled, those are the shrimp, pork, egg, and leek dumplings and the #2 fried, those are the pork and mushroom.   The #20 were incredible, a light but flavorful taste and the boiling was the perfect choice. The dumplings didn't have that watery feel you get in some places either. The fried pork and mushroom arrived next and were a good counterpoint to the light #20s. The fried bottoms had a nice texture and went well with the flavors, but we agreed that maybe we should have ordered them boiled. They were still quite good. I keep thinking about picking picking up a few ordered just before we leave to go home."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of dumplings in a lot of countries, but this place may have the most interesting dumpling flavor I've tried to date.  Decor: Unfortunately, this place did not have as many waving neko cats as I would have liked, having only one waving cat at the register in the back.   Food: I was getting more and more ravenous during the excruciating wait, but I could tell at once that the dumplings were indeed freshly made and wrapped by the women in the window at the back because my fried dumpling order had long tubular dumplings while the boiled dumplings were more of the half moon shape.   The fried dumplings, pork/shrimp/mushroom filling, were good although not superlative, mostly because of the ground pork which seemed of relatively poor quality and the overly large, crunchy but pretty tasteless pieces of shrimp. The fried outside, which seemed to have been coated with a little cornstarch and then fried, was crusty and good but nothing to write home about. However, the boiled pork/preserved vegetable/fresh oyster dumpling (which was the most expensive dumpling on the menu at around $10) was out of this world! The oyster flavor was fresh, flavorful, and not overpowering, and the salted vegetable gave it even more of an umami boost. The spicy sauce and the vinegar were also delightful.   Overall: Five stars for the oyster dumplings, but one star off for the overall so-so service and other issues, including the fact that they were out of the hand-pulled noodles."}
{"text":"We've been here several times on each of our trips to Montreal and it never disappoints. It's the best dumplings in Chinatown, fresh and flavorful.  It gets crowded quickly so come early."}
{"text":"On my Crusade through Montreal my comrades and I destroyed an army of dumpling soldiers at this location.  Their circular formations provided little resistance to our precision strikes.    I woke up this morning I looked at myself in the mirror and asked \"What's for dinner?\" A pilgrimage must be made.    Lamb and coriander dumplings steamed is my piece of Intel.  The food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Located in a somewhat sketchy basement the food makes up for it. Although the atmosphere is full of TVs blasting Chinese take shows."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese dumplings restaurant in Chinatown. We came here primarily because of Yelp, but also because we were just walking and this place stood out. The restaurant itself is quite small and very crowded. Dumplings are freshly made by workers in the kitchen, which is available for the public to see in. The menu, salad, dumplings, dumplings in soup, and dessert. Everything is inexpensive and delicious. We started off with the celery and peanuts salad. The celery was a bit soft, but went well with the black peanuts. Served in a very mild vinegar-based sauce. Being around dumplings so much, like in Flushing, NY, there are so many places that all show expertise in their dumpling making process. This is what this place reminds me of. Dumplings are an art, and if you can make quality dumplings one after the other, then there is a quality Chinese dumpling restaurant. At this restaurant, you combine the soy sauce and the vinegar together, just like the sauce for eating soup dumplings. We had ordered the pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings, the beef and leek dumplings, and the pork and shrimp dumplings in soup. By far, the best were the pork and Chinese cabbage. They had the most flavor. I prefer dumplings to be boiled/steamed, so the skin is very soft and rich in flavor. Extremely hot. The broth of the soup was very plain, barely any taste. So I combined the soup with my soy sauce and vinegar mixture, and in an instant, it was at least 5 times better. The beef was very tender, and with the leeks made a great dumpling. They aren't necessarily soup dumplings, but when you bite into them, a little broth comes out, which was really delicious. My only concerns were service, since they weren't friendly at all, and the dumplings themselves, since they didn't truly stand out from any other dumpling I have had in the past."}
{"text":"Very good and delicious But just a little greasy If I come back this city,I will come back eat this food,is good"}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal, don't miss this little hole in the wall. Best dumplings I have eaten."}
{"text":"I had the lamb dumplings which were flavorful and I would highly recommend.  Very friendly service from the staff.  And I cherished the more traditional Chinese  seaweed served as the salad.  I'll be coming back just to find this salad."}
{"text":"This is the best dumplings place I have ever been. Should try their salad too :)"}
{"text":"Possibly the best dumplings ever.  Perfect example of do one thing, and do it well.  Very busy though, expect a bit if a wait, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious dumpling.  I tried the fried pork and coriander ones.  I still remember the perfect little burst of broth from each bite :) Can't wait to tried the steamed ones next time around."}
{"text":"The dumplings are good, not gonna lie but I have a feeling they do not properly wash their ingredients. More than once when I ordered the dumplings with coriander I noticed gritty sand/ dirt particles in the dumplings. The eating experience was very uncomfortable when you chew the dumpling and feel the crunching of sand between your teeth. If I wanted sand in my food I'd have a picnic on the beach!"}
{"text":"Dim sum perfection. Very little color I can add. The portions are generous and the flavors devine!   Tried the beef and coriander, the pork and leek and the beef and tomato. Will try the lamb next time."}
{"text":"Service was slow considering they just open when we arrived but all in all, it was well worth the wait. Especially for the amount of dumplings you get for such a low price. Would definitely go back !"}
{"text":"We rolled in 35 min before closing, only to find that their credit card machine was broken and that they could only take cash. It took us over 30 min to walk to the nearest branch to get cash from the machine, and we returned 5 min before closing. They seated us without even a word of complaint, so kudos to them. (We did see them send away anyone who arrived after closing, though, so get there on time!) Service was brisk but friendly.  The food took a bit of time to arrive, but seeing as they make the dumplings to order, I wouldn't complain. We ordered pork/leek (boiled), beef/onion (fried), and tried to order the pork/shrimp/mushroom, but they were out of mushroom, so they offered to substitute cilantro instead. The cilantro flavor pretty much overpowered any other flavor in the dumpling, but if you like cilantro, that would be the dumpling for you.  Personally I would have preferred the mushroom.  That said, the other dumplings were absolutely heavenly: fresh and flavorful, skins just thick enough to hold the dumpling securely, but not so thick as to be doughy. For dipping sauces, there were soy sauce, vinegar, and hot sauce on the table, but the dumplings barely needed anything. Seriously the best dumplings I've eaten in recent memory. The boiled ones were soft, delicate, and pillowy, whereas the fried ones were tougher in texture but with a beautiful, crunchy, golden side.    The dumplings come fifteen to an order, so make sure you get there hungry, or are willing to share. Me, I wouldn't share these."}
{"text":"Big portions and good food for a very cheap price."}
{"text":"They only have 1 kind of veggie dumpling and  1 kind of seafood  so it was a challenge for a no pork eater.  Since I was doing take out,  they don't allow half and half on takeouts so I opted for the veggie dumplings.  Overall it was better then many in terms of texture and and flour wasn't breaking apart ( tryst me gave had those as well)  but the flavor wasn't top notch.  The mushroom type of flavor was a little over powering.  I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the largest selection of dumplings I have ever seen.  The soup is good, but the star are the dry dumplings.  I went with fired, to complement my girlfriend's soup.  I enjoyed watching the 3 older women make the dumplings in the kitchen.  I am not sure if the wrapper is fresh made or not.  It is on the commercially produced thin side.  I like thicker wrappers more, but that certainly does not detract at all.  I would encourage anyone in Montreal to stop here."}
{"text":"My wife and I really love the food here. Even in China, it is not easy to find such delicious Jiaozi."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and delicious this is THE dumpling house of China-town!  Large variety, and always savory - definitely worth the stop. You can also make your own dipping sauce from the traditional ingredients at the table.  You have every meat option - veggy, shrimp, pork, beef etc"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place with delicious dumplings and good, friendly service. Especially the pork & Chinese cabbage dumplings (boiled), dipped in a mixture of soy sauce and chili flakes & oil.  You can watch the ladies cooking in the kitchen from the dining area, which is pretty neat.  Wish you could order a side of steamed rice though. The complimentary hot tea was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings whether they are fried, boiled or served in soup.  Never had dumplings so good before in any of those forms.  It's the dumpling equivalent of Thriller - perfect."}
{"text":"OMG. Thanks to Yelp we found this VERY tiny and VERY good dumpling emporium in Montreal.  Tables are tiny and portions are huge. When the waiter says \"too much\"... Listen.  No licquor licence means lots of tea. I stayed up all night long dreaming of the meal I just finished.  If you love food and your fellow man - go here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it was a lackluster experience for me. The waitress was not that friendly. I ordered the shrimp, egg, and leek dumplings, and she said I could only get steamed for this one. I asked her if it were possible to get half fried and half steamed, and she waved me off saying no (even though the menu said you could, for an extra $0.50 charge). My boyfriend ordered the beef and curry onion dumplings, which she stated that the fried version was better. My boyfriend didn't want fried, so he asked if he could get them steamed, and she said they weren't good like that. So he asked which she suggested, and she said the beef and coriander. But he wanted to try something new (he's had the coriander version at another place), and was in the mood for curry. Things got super confusing, so my boyfriend told her okay to the coriander ones. She ended up writing down the beef and curry onion ones, steamed... We got them to go, and waited almost 40 minutes for them... there were only three other people in the restaurant. Opening up the container was slightly disappointing too... as they are definitely smaller than the ones I am used to. At the other place, I eat the dumplings in two bites and can't finish all 15. They were pretty good, but I will not come back here. The next time I crave dumplings, I know to stick with my favourite place."}
{"text":"Small dumpling shop in Montreal's Chinatown. I ordered the fried cabbage and pork dumplings and some steamed shrimp, mushroom and pork dumplings. Both were flavorful and delicious perfect for lunch. I will be back to try out the other kinds of dumplings. Btw it's cash only."}
{"text":"Ok.. Very dirty restaurant front and kitchen.  Also took 30 mins for simple dumplings. Think they were flown in from Queens."}
{"text":"The food and price is 5/5 stars, great dumplings here, but the service is 2/5 and cleanliness is like 2/5. I am giving them a 3 since I really do love the food!  Now, I love hole in the wall places as much as I love fancy high end places, they each have their place in my dining repertoire. The bar for service and ambiance is shifted accordingly for the hole in the wall places, but I still expect at least to be acknowledged and given a menu after 15 minutes of seating! I tried to catch the waitresses's attention multiple times and when I did make eye contact with her and said \"Hi can I get menus please\" I was ignored. WTF? I had to desperately flag down a passing waiter guy for menus (they have 1 female and 1 male waiter/bus boy that night).  As for cleanliness, I do not expect to be seated on a chair with grease and the napkin/chopsticks holder to have hair in it at any restaurant. Also napkins were all over the floor at the table we were seated.  Now the positive: The food was amazing. We got the pan fried curry beef dumpling. It was crispy, juicy and the dough was chewy. The meat to dough ratio was perfect. The curry in the beef flavours it nicely, it was not overwhelming. Just a note, pan fried dumplings cost $1.50 more.  The boiled pork, mushroom and shrimp dumpling was also great, the dough was a nice consistency and the filling juicy. There was even some soup inside the dumplings reminding me a little of shanghai soup dumplings.  Overall, great food, poor service and general cleanliness."}
{"text":"Nice spot for big plates of dumplings including some good vegetarian options. Not the best I've had and the dough is a bit thick but still a good option for those cold cold days. Be warned that they don't seem to have everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for fabulous, fresh, well-made dumplings. Cash only so be sure to have some on you but well worth the hassle. Serving sizes are generous too."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars for food, but it deserves 2 due to lack of sanitation.  There is a window where you can observe the workers making your dumplings, and over the course of about 45 minutes there I watched a worker cough on the back of her hand (she was not wearing gloves) and wipe her nose. As someone making food for other people, that is completely unacceptable. In addition, when someone spilled a glass of water by accident, the server just wiped the water onto the floor instead of cleaning it up   As for the food, the dumplings were good but nothing out of this world. We tried pork with peppers pan fried, and they weren't even fried correctly. The skin was hard and had a chalky consistency. I would definitely recommend getting them boiled- the beef with coriander and lamb with leek were both much better. Beef with coriander was pretty good, and the lamb was only mediocre."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. I enjoyed more the steamed than the fried ones but both are very tasty and made right there for you."}
{"text":"Had the pork coriander shrimp steamed dumplings and the shrimp leek and egg pan fried dumplings, both super good. Had the cucumber salad and was so so.  Would definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"if your looking for luxury. don't go there. if your looking for a super friendly polite staff. don't go there....but if your looking for the best dumplings ever, GO THERE!! the minced lamb, beef and seafood dumplings are worth however you need to get there....oh ya and please order the boiled option....while fried option is good, boiled with the spicey oil is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Last week i went to Qing Hua a few doors down and wanted to compare the two. Go to Qing Hua seriously. I ordered 2 servings of dumplings to go. One boiled and one fried. The waitress told us it would take 15mins. There was maybe 5-6 other people in the place. It took one hour to get our order...im not even kidding. For some reason they decided to serve people that came after us first. Even one guy ordered 5 servings to go and his order was done 25mins before ours! When we finally got our dumplings i realised that they gave us the wrong order. I wouldnt have minded if they didnt charge extra for frying the dumpling. So we waited another 15 mins and what i got was a greasy burned mess. It was disgusting. I guess they wanted to hurry up and give us our order as quickly as possible but all i could taste was burned oil. I ate 4 and threw out the rest. At this point i expected maybe a full or even partial refund but all we got was a free can of coke. I am never coming back to this place. Go to Qing Hua, better quality and much faster service."}
{"text":"Very cheap dumplings that have more quality than their price gives away. Each of my pork and shrimp dumplings had a whole baby shrimp inside and were very juicy :). I saved half for dinner and was very satisfied. I wouldn't say these are the best dumplings I've had, but they are great given the price."}
{"text":"This place is much better then Qing Hua and less salty.  Lots of selection!!  You can also order fresh (non frozen) dumplings to take home and cook yourself.  My GF and I favorite: Beef Curry Dumplings.  So good and juicy!! Watch your shirt!  This place is also very popular, but you should not have problems getting a table."}
{"text":"On a friday night, not too many clients.  We sat and they serve us an interesting Green tea.  We ordered fried dumplings (Pork chinese cabbage and pork & shrimp).  Quick after-supper snack. LOL  The waiting time was incredibly long for some reasons. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the 2nd serving of tea and great conversation. The dumplings were tasty :D . I especially like the pork & shrimp one.  I am bias. I don't usually eat dumplings, but when I do, the fried one tasted damned good. Relaxing place. No one seems to be in a hurry. I would go again for Tea and good price dumplings."}
{"text":"The best dumpling place in town, good price and ultimately they serve dumplings that make us 'wow'. We try different dumplings each time we visit but always include pork, shrimp and coriander dumplings. Many people mention about spicy cucumber salad but try also lettuce and egg salad with wasabi dressing, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Great dumplings, crappy service. We were in the mood for something fast, delicious and non- Western. This seemed like it would fit the bill. They don't take reservations and so the wait on a Saturday night was fairly long. The waitress was impatient and unhelpful. We ordered pickled cucumbers as an appetizer thinking that they would come before the food (since they were listed on the appetizer portion of the menu!). They never came so I finally just got up and told the guy to cancel them. After waiting 40 minutes for our food I got up a 3rd time to inquire about the status of our order and then finally  the 3rd time I asked the dumplings started to arrive. It's true that they were busy that night but still...perhaps if we were to do during a non-peak time the service would better."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family, as visitors from Toronto. We eat Chinese food regularly (there are tons of Chinese restos in Toronto), and have to say that this little place isn't fancy and the service is rather brisk (but what Chinese place has good service?) - but it's ALL worth it for the delicious handcrafted dumplings! Here's the rundown...  PLACE: A small and rather unappealing-looking place. It was packed at 6:30pm on a Friday night... Always a good sign! No  children though, so we doubted they had a high chair for our infant but when asked, the waitress brought a little booster chair over.    FOOD: The menu is 95% dumplings, with a few small appetizers to round it out. Honestly, I don't think anyone goes for the appetizers which included a cucumber salad. This made me laugh as it seemed like an afterthought.   You can get the dumplings boiled or fried. We got them boiled and they came out piping hot. The wrapping was very fine and slightly toothsome. The filling was soft and well-seasoned. The only (slight) complaint is that although we ordered 3 types of dumplings (pork, seafood and beef), they all tasted very similar. All very good though! It costs only $8 for a plate of 15 yummy little dumplings... So cheap!!  I would say one plate is a good-sized portion for an individual.   SERVICE: They came and filled up water fairly fast when we arrived. Food came out within about 10 minutes. They weren't too sensitive about safety as they kept placing the steaming hot plates right in front of the infant. But I guess they are just rushed.   All in all, this place is a gem! So happy we came here (thanks to the other good Yelp reviews)!   Note: They only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"Normally excellent dumplings, but today my lunchmate was served 15 minutes before me. I soon discovered why, my order was burned black on th edges but they served it to me anyway, with no comment from the server. As it had taken  40 minutes from ordering for my meal to arrive I ate it anyway as I had to get back to work. Needless to say I burned my mouth. On paying I told the server my meal had been burned and all she said was \"sorry\", no offer to comp, no offer of anything else, in fact. I give a rating of three as the food is normally quite good but rest assured that if there is a lunch rush they may screw up your food with no compunction about it. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"So where do I begin... 1 star was already generous.  My first time being here was not exactly the best experience a tourist could have.   We first arrive and was given room temperature tea on a cold day. Shortly after we placed our order and was very excited about the food.   3 sets of customers come in, sat down and placed their orders. As I witness all these customers devouring their food, my boyfriend (who has a bad headache due to lack of food )and I continue to sit at the restaurant.   After 40 minutes go by, I told this bitchy waitress that we have been waiting for a long time. To their response, they forgot and took our order again for the second time. As customer service, they provided us a free salad that looks like a dog has regurgitated out and just said sorry.   We waited and waited as we watch them eat their food and pretty much all customers have left at this point.  If you don't want to wait long, please do not come here. This is not how to serve customers or keep them!"}
{"text":"This restaurant illustrates the power and benefit of Yelp.  If you walked up to this place, you would never enter, much less eat there.  The absence of decor, the worn and dirty carpet, and the sparse tables might suggest your dining experience would be equally bland.  If you turned away and kept walking down the street, you would miss a fantastic meal.  I'm no connoisseur, but the dumplings here are excellent.  We started with the cucumber and celery salads and then our dumplings arrived soon after.  Wow.  We tried a plate of steamed ones and a plate of fried ones.  I have to say I preferred them steamed but this is a minor quibble and a matter of personal taste.  My advice to you is to not judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"This place has the best dumplings I've ever tried.  It's truly exceptional - I liked it so much that on my last visit to Montreal I went out of my way to go there twice.  I actually made three meals of it by grabbing takeout on the second trip.  (They keep pretty well although the steamed ones reheat to original form in a microwave better than fried.)  The only criticism could be that dumplings are the only thing on the menu, but really I see it as more of a strength.  They focus on doing one thing exceptionally well.  There is enough variety on their list to keep anyone happy.  Mai Xiang Yuan will be a regular stop on my visits to Montreal from now on."}
{"text":"This was a perfect restaurant - cozy, cheap, and tasty food.  The dumplings were a big  hit with adults and kids alike..  We also enjoyed the cucumber and celery/peanut salads."}
{"text":"How have I never been to this place before?! I feel like I've been missing out! I think I need to go back to this place everyday for a month to make up for this!  SO delicious. I prefer the boiled dumplings rather than the fried because the dumplings themselves are so delicious you don't want any of that deliciousness masked by the taste of fried oil (I can't believe I just said that, I love fried stuff).  Definitely going back here. again, and again.  It's tiny, so you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"An incredible dunpling retaurant situated in China town. The dumpling are small yet so incredibly flavourful that every bite is just such a delight. I had the chinese cabbage and pork steamed dumpling and the pork, shrimp and coriander steamed dumpling and they were so extraordianary!"}
{"text":"Okay for the price and amount of dumplings you get here, it is totally worth it.  15 per order, made right in front of you by a bunch of ladies too!  Definitely would come here if you want a dumpling fix and not spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"Busy, casual dumpling house with beer.  7 PM Saturday night our party of two was seated quickly; menus, amenities, etc. came more slowly, but the two or three young servers were obviously keeping up as best they could.  We wanted the plate of 15 dumplings with two different types (surcharge for mixing types), but were strongly advised against mixing it up during the \"busy time\".  So we got one type, pork & mushroom, with a starter salad of cabbage and wasabi.  You can get steamed (but why get angry?  ha ha ha - seriously, steamed seemed more popular) or fried (our choice).  The wasabi cabbage was good and powerful.  The dumplings were extremely hot (temperature-wise) and just a little too burnt in places; if we'd gotten steamed (ha ha ha), we may have been able to appreciate the filling more, but it seemed good."}
{"text":"My friend loves its Jianbing. It is just like a normal small restaurant in China."}
{"text":"These dumplings are delicious.  Fried pork coriander and shrimp dumplings with a cucumber salad.  The cucumbers are in a slighty spicy vinegar and are perfect with piping hot, homemade right behind you, ridiculously yummy dumplings."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 different dishes- pork/seaweed (steamed-least favorite), pork/pickled cabbage(steamed, very good)/ beef/curry (fried-favorite!), lamb/coriander (steamed,close 2nd!). Next time, I'll order them all fried.  Kids tried dumplings for the first time and loved it. Great value for the price and very good food. Service is friendly, but slow and the dining area was a bit dirty (floors). Otherwise, I would have easily given Mai Xiang Yuan 5 stars. Give it a try if you are looking for good flavors and don't need a pristine atmosphere."}
{"text":"Honestly I came to Montreal hoping to get away from all the Asian cuisine offered in Toronto, but as I was walking to my hotel through Chinatown on an empty stomach I got desperate and stumbled into this dumpling place, with a cute dumpling sign above the door. Now, I have nothing against Asian cuisine, it's just that I have dumplings all the time and can have it whenever I want. Despite all this prejudice, I have to say, these were some of the BEST dumplings I have had. It's a little bit ridiculous how much I enjoyed these dumplings when I tried so hard to avoid Chinese food in Montreal. I ordered the boiled pork and leek dumplings and the fried lamb and onion dumplings. The servings were definitely worth the price, came in a big plate of about 12-15 for less than $10. The boiled dumplings were absolutely perfect, while the fried ones could have been better, they were a little burnt and hard, which took away from the taste. Overall very good dumplings and came pretty quickly too. The staff spoke English, French and Mandarin fluently. I also really liked the cups, soy sauce plates and teapots they had."}
{"text":"amazing dumplings.  We had the steamed pork and cabbage dumpling and fried lamb and onion dumpling.  They were both delicious but the lamb was phenomenal.  Would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"We didn't realize they had moved to the bigger space next door and for one HORRIFYING MOMENT, I stood staring at the locked door in front of the papered-up windows, devastated. After a moment Andrew said, \"Well, let's just go to this other place instead,\" and I said, \"Okay...\"  Lo and behold, we picked up the menus and it said Mai Xiang Yuan. Phew! :)  The quality and taste of the dumplings were just as good as our first visit, though the tea was sub-par. Now that we've been here twice, we will probably explore beyond MXY for our next Montreal dumpling experience."}
{"text":"Pau Pau's (AKA grandma's!) make the dumplings in the kitchen as you wait for your order! Amazing! I didn't realize this until we were paying. We ordered pork and mushroom dumplings. Being a huge mushroom lover, I'm happy they didn't use cheap mushrooms. The mushrooms had a very nice flavor. 15 came in an order. Holy cow! I could eat these everyday... and I would, if I live here!"}
{"text":"Classic awesome dumpling place that you'd walk right by because it's a hole in the wall. If you like dumplings be sure to check it out. Comes with complimentary tea. There are 15 dumplings on a plate which may sound like a lot, but it's just the right size. You can get them boiled or fried. Hard to recommend only one, but I'd say Lamb coriander boiled."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez les dim sum faits maison allez au china Town dans ce petit Resto :) les dim sums sont vraiment super bons et frais et leur prix est plus que correct !   Le Must, l'eau est gratuite et on épargne sur les boissons ;)  Le service est correct aussi   Je déconseille toutefois les dim sum fris car ils perdent le goût de la garniture. Je conseille fortement de commander les steamed ou boiled :)  Les bufs coriandre ainsi que les crevettes champignons sont succulents"}
{"text":"Os Dumplings cozidos, ensopados e fritos são muito bons!! Os melhores que comemos em Montreal, são feitos na hora."}
{"text":"Superb and made to order, these dumplings rock. I Tried the lamb, shrimp and coriander, pan fried. Fucking great. Do not miss this place if you love dumplings. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cozy spot in china town to get your dumpling fix. I ordered the #22, shrimp, egg and leek dumplings, fried. The hubby ordered the pork and leek dumplings fried as well as pork soup dumplings. Complimentary tea was served while we waited, it was nothing amazing. Had a couple sips and pushed it to the side.   While your waiting, you can also experiment with creating your own dipping sauce for the dumplings as they have vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil on the table.   I found the dumplings to be just OK, but the hubby loved his pork and leek dumplings. He tried a bite of mine and said there was something missing. Guess the pork dumplings are the way to go! I ended up pouring soy sauce and vinegar all over the dumplings to add more zing to it.   I am glad I checked out this place, but wouldn't rush to go back."}
{"text":"We picked this little dumpling shop for a quick dinner on a cold evening and are we ever glad we did!  We were pretty early and the service was ultra fast.  The dumplings were delicious, and we tucked into them so quickly we both burned our mouths . . . and then went back for more.  These are not mass produced dumplings, but handmade with love."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Chinatown. I tried them at Oh Dumpling and they were $12 albeit slightly bigger. The filling was not as good at Oh Dumpling however. The filling in these ones at Mai Xiang Yuan have actual pieces of shrimp and are delicious, DELICIOUS!  I took the pork, shrimp and coriander (SO GOOD) and the pork, shrimp and mushrooms (DELICIOUS). Sooo yummy.  Also it is much cheaper here. $17 for 2 orders of dumplings is a far better deal than at the fancy Oh Dumpling.  Also the restaurant doesn't look very fancy or clean (the carpet is totally stained) but at least they're putting the money in the food."}
{"text":"This place it's so good.  Don't go there looking for a well put together dumpling place. The restaurant itself looks pretty bit-up, but what matter is the food, and that they got it right! The salads and dumplings are delicious, they serve tea once you are seated, and that is good too. And before I forget, oh so afordable!"}
{"text":"If you ever ask me where to get authentic, delicious, and homemade dumplings, Mai Xiang Yuan will always be my go-to answer. I grew up in a household that frequently made dumplings from scratch, and I can safely say that I've never been disappointed here.   I've been frequenting this place since my first year at university, and one thing that I really love is their frozen dumpling takeout option - it was probably this that won my loyalty. Every once in a while I'll go and buy two or three bags of dumplings (usually #5, if I remember correctly) and throw them in the freezer for later. They're super convenient when you're too lazy to cook, and they're a lot cheaper than takeout.   At the restaurant, you can get your dumplings either steamed or fried. Their dumplings are hand wrapped by cooks behind the counter, which guarantees their freshness. There's a huge variety to choose from, but not all of them can be bought frozen. The only drawback is that everything is cash only."}
{"text":"They really get 2.5 stars.  Came here on a Friday at 11:15am.  Service: We were seated right away and food came out fast. We asked for tea and were told that they were not serving tea because in the past few days the temperature was quite hot outside. What? First, that day was cool and rainy, so tea would have been quite appropriate.  Second, does a city stop serving hot coffee in the summer? I live in New York where we have really hot summers and they always serve tea at Chinese restaurants.  When asked for soup dumplings they told us it was not available for lunch and only dinner. WTH?!  Food: The seaweed and cucumber salad were good. The beef and cilantro fried dumplings were good but not amazing. The pork steamed dumplings and the shrimp, scallion and eggs dumplings were mediocre.  This place was disappointing; proceed with caution."}
{"text":"The dumplings are fantastic but the service was... lacking. I want to say almost non-existent. But maybe it was just an especially off night.  Go for the dumplings and only the dumplings. In all honesty though, I've had equally good dumplings in other spots in Montreal. Yes, these other places were a tad more expensive, but provided more atmosphere and service, which count for a lot."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Montreal. Absolutely phenomenal. Unfortunately, the service isn't great, but you make sacrifices when the dumplings are this good."}
{"text":"Poor service, bland food, dirty tables (with plastic covers no less), don't accept credit cards and, for tourists, lousy exchange rate and no foreign change. Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Dumpling heaven. Yelp for the win (again).  We ordered: - Pork, coriander and shrimp regular  - Beef and celery fried  Both were amazing and hand made to order. You can even watch the ladies in he window making them. They're super quick and efficient.   Ample pay parking along the streets of Montreal's Chinatown.   I am still dreaming of the dumplings and hope I can find something up to par closer to home."}
{"text":"Le service fut horriblement lent. En effet, nous avons du attendre 45minutes apres avoir commandé pour recevoir nos plats. Par contre les dumplings etaient bons. Le decor etait bien sympatoche et l'ambiance etait agreable."}
{"text":"By far the best dumpling place ever.   I am glad they moved next door to a bigger and better place.   Everything is fresh and so tasty. Love the sauce that you can mix at ur taste right at your table. They do need to get cold water because all they seem to have is room temperature. Another reason why I only gave 4 stars is they only have one salad left on their menu they use to have a few different one but last time I was there all they had was celery and peanut salad and it might have been good but I did not try it.  I do love that they make the dumplings as you order them and you can see the ladies making them so you know you are not getting frozen stuff"}
{"text":"I prefer going here for dinner, since I'm a big fan of the cucumber salad which they didn't seem to be serving at lunch. One recommendation would be to add rice to the menu though."}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall place in the middle of Montreal's chinatown. These are the types of restaurants where you go strictly for the food, don't expect fine dining and tablecloths, just expect good eats for a low price. The cucumber salad is a nice compliment to the dumplings especially during the summer. I recommend the boiled dumplings for a lighter and flavorful option."}
{"text":"Omg omg omg, love! We've been bragging about this place to anyone displaying even a modicum of interest. We went around lunch time, but before it might get crowded. The server was quick and lovely. Everyone seemed friendly... and the food... I didn't know how much I could love a dumpling, but first, the appetizer. I ordered a mushroom salad, which turned out to be the most delicate little treat. I wish I knew what type of mushrooms these were (straw, maybe? ), but they were compact little meaty things, served with slivers of carrot, in a light sauce with coriander.  The dumplings, oh yasss. They come 15 to a serving, and were delivered in a neat little basket.  They keep soy sauce and vinegar on the table, for you to mix your dipping sauce. We shared the egg and shrimp dumplings. They were cooked to perfection, with the seams holding well together. The degree to which the individual flavors presented themselves was mesmerizing. My favorite part though, was how the shrimp had that perfect \"pop\" right inside those steamy little pockets.  We keep trying to find the time to get back there. This place is great."}
{"text":"Dumplings galore!!! This tiny Chinatown joint serves up Montreal's best dumplings. They come either boiled or pan-fried, with pork, beef, lamb and seafood offerings. A variety of secondary ingredients are offered with each one and as well as vegetarian choices. I love the pork, oyster and pickled Chinese cabbage and it is the best when pan-fried. Really brings out the flavoring of the oyster.   I also tried the pork, leek and egg dumpling and that I would recommend as well.  I only wish they served tea here."}
{"text":"These little hand made pockets of golden goodness are special. Really. I mean Radiohead special. If you are capable of pacing yourself rather than swallowing them whole, two at a time, when you actually cut into one and peek inside, you will see blissful dumpling elves frolicking in a coriander meadow under the warm, late-summer sun. And you will feel absolutely ZERO remorse for eating the dumpling elves alive.  Any of the steamed dumplings with coriander in them are the best.  Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Service was very slow w e waited for almost an hour to get served granted it was very a busy day. The dumplings weren't as filling as we thought it would be if you go do not get the pan fried once they are very dry. The side dishes were also overpriced."}
{"text":"Cheap, yummy. The service is bad but that's an indicator of authenticity, or so they say!  I've only had dumplings here - do they sell anything else? - and they're wonderful. I was very sad when I somehow misplaced my bag of frozen dumplings in a pharmacy or in the woods somewhere.  Also, cash only. They have an ATM but ATMs suck."}
{"text":"From San Francisco, needless to say I've had some of the best Chinese food. Dumpling wise, this place rocks. I had the Lamb-coriander, fried... Really, really good... Strong lamb flavor... Great stuff... Comes in an order of 15 (costs xtra for fried).. They're not that big, so go for it..wife had fried beef-coriander -shrimp...again, great flavor... If you don't like wasabi, don't get the cabbage salad... Didn't know.. Small place, tables super close... It works.. I'm 275 lbs and I menuvered ok...  do it!!!"}
{"text":"The dumplings were very tasty, but the small side dishes were not a great first impression for me. Also. Don't order the the potstickers. They did not taste as good as the dumplings. The service was ok. You might not want to go there for groups. There was no bill. They just told you the total amount you were paying for"}
{"text":"Incredibly unassuming from the outside, but come in for a taste and you'll be blown away by the authenticity of the food and the great prices that are associated with it. Being born in China, this was the closest I've come to home made dumplings in a long time. I strongly recommend the pork with shrimp and mushroom; really amazing fresh seafood taste with the umami of the mushroom.  The side dishes, although only 3 in total, we're excellently prepared and greatly priced too. In essence, great food, cheap prices, you can't go wrong coming here!  Food: 5 stars Prices 5 stars Ambiance: 3 stars...but typical Chinatown fanfare"}
{"text":"Je suis une fan inconditionnelle des dumplings. Ceux-ci étaient bons et délicieux. Je ne mets pas les 5 étoiles pour une raison pratique. Ils n'ont pas de machine de paiement par carte. Je veux bien cela donne du cachet et un peu d'authenticité au resto mais pas pratique du tout. je recommande quand meme car ils servent bien et vite."}
{"text":"We visited this little restaurant for my boyfriend's sister's birthday on a Saturday night. We made reservations and if you want to come here on a Saturday night I'd recommend it. This little place is packed and there were people waiting to sit the whole time we were there.   We ordered five types of dumplings because there were five of us. (Which, by the way, is a large group in this place. We were a little cramped.)  We could have ordered just four - five dishes was a lot of food! All of the dumplings were very good, but standard dumplings - nothing really different that you should obviously order or risk missing out. The only obvious miss was the dumplings with pork and oysters - they were very fishy without much additional flavour. We got two orders fried and three orders steamed for variety, which I'd recommend. The fried dumplings are EXTREMELY hot when they come to the table - don't think you can bite into them right away or you will burn the roof of your mouth. (Trust me.)  Overall, everything was good, but not amazing. I'd be happy to return but there are so many restaurants still to visit in Montreal! If we went back I'd love to try some of the non-dumpling dishes."}
{"text":"De très bons dumplings. Tous très savoureux.   Par contre, leur service est pitoyable. Ne comprend pas bien ni le français ni l'anglais. Un autre jour, l'horaire indiquait qu'il fermer à 22h, mais à 21h, ils ont refusé de faire des dumplings pour emporter. Un autre jour, ils ont décidé qu'ils ne prenaient pas de carte de crédit ni de débit, pourtant rien n'indiquait que leur machine interac ne fonctionnait pas. Une autre fois, ils m'ont dit que cela prendrait 30 minutes, mais ca l'a pris plus d'une heure.   Malgré leur affreux services, on y retourne parce que les dumplings restent très bons. J'aime malgré mieux le qing hua."}
{"text":"Came here because we  wanted to try something in Chinatown and decided on dumplings or raviolis as the French say! We tried the pork, mushroom, and shrimp dumplings! So juicy and good. Each bite had a piece of shrimp.   So for reviews that say it takes awhile! The dumplings are wrapped fresh!!!!! So if they have a full house it could take up to 30 min to even wrap and then cook your dumplings.   Seriously legit and they have so many flavors! Mad respect for them and the flavors.   Btw it's Cash only like most places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. We had pork/leek and beef/coriander. They were crispy, not greasy, and delicious. Also very affordable, considering you get 15 dumplings per order."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other day when there were other patrons but the restaurant wasn't necessarily busy. Tea was yummy and they gave us free salads (seaweed salad and a celery-peanut concoction) to celebrate them reopening. Ordered the boiled pork, mushroom, and shrimp dumplings, the fried beef and onion dumplings, and the steamed lamb and celery dumplings. They were all delicious, with my favourite being the boiled dumplings: I liked the flavour the mushrooms provided and I have a preference for boiled vs any other way of cooking dumplings. Hearty portions of meat and shrimp in each dumpling! They fry dumplings interestingly here - not individually in a pan like I expected but in this machine that pressed them together and fried both sides at the same time (kind of like a panini press?). The result was still delicious, but you had to pry them apart because they stuck together in rows of ~5.  Had vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil so you could make your own dipping sauce. I'd prefer less chili oil and more chili paste but that's my preference.  Friendly waitstaff and short wait times for the boiled and steamed dumplings - the fried ones took fairly long. Overall a wonderful time; I want to go back and try the vegetarian dumplings!"}
{"text":"I think it must be among the best dumpling in Montreal, we liked the beef/coriander and the beef/leek the best. Anyway i think it's absolutely a place to go for someone into dumpling !!! And it's definitely one of the least pricey too a plate of 15 dumping will cost you only 9-10 $.  Un des meilleur restaurant de dumplings à Montréal !   Nous avons bien aimés les dumplings au boeuf/coriandre et aussi au boeuf/poireau  à la vapeur !  C'est le restaurant à  essayer si vous aimez les dumplings. Et définitivem,ent un des moins cher : Seulement de 9 à 10 $ pour une assiette de 15 dumplings !!! À essayer !"}
{"text":"This is the place we are 100% sure to go for at least one lunch while in Montreal.  As others have said, their dumplings are absolutely amazing.  While we've stuck to the boiled ones - we never get tired of them as they are incredibly high quality and soooo tasty - not to mention as fresh as can be (since they make them a few feet away from where you sit).   This time around we were in their new, larger location - which is a little nicer than their old.  A little less cramped and easier to find a seat during busy lunch-time hours.  Bottom line - if you like incredibly delicious, authentic dumplings, go here immediately!"}
{"text":"Got beef onions and pork/leek/shrimp dumplings. One boiled and one fried. Both were pretty good."}
{"text":"Everything you need to know:  They make dumplings.  Almost nothing but.  There are a couple of weird peach and seaweed salad offerings on the last page of the very short menu, but really, you'd have to be nuts.  There are fifteen dumplings to a plate, all the same.  You can have 'em steamed, or, for an extra buck and a half, fried.  The fried ones will be mouth-burningly HOT.  Let them cool a bit.  Two dumpling fanatics should *easily* be able to polish off three plates between them.  The little saucer on top of your teacup is not for your teacup;  it's for your dipping sauce.  The soy sauce, vinegar, and hot pepper-flake oil on the table are for you to build your own dipping sauce with.      Small place, forty seats, tops;  closes early.  And it gets busy, fast.  You may have trouble if you're a group of eight, or even four on some nights.  May want to draw straws if you're an odd-numbered gang.  A table for two should be easy to manage on most nights, though.  Atmosphere is low-key, laid back.  Surprisingly nice, warm light for a no-frills Chinatown dumpling joint.  No annoying background music that I can remember.  Tables bussed and cleaned properly.  Competent service.  Might actually make a decent date place for, say, a low-rent second date with a fellow rabid dumpling aficionado.  One can actually have a conversation, and the food will surely impress.  Their pork & leek dumplings are, hands down, the best things I've eaten this winter.  ZOMFG."}
{"text":"Trusted fellow yelpers on this choice. Yes, no disappointment, it was very good especially the steamed pork & cabbage dumplings. Waoooooo.... Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and so I finally had the chance.  Pretty mediocre.    The boiled dumplings were definitely better than the fried ones.  I liked that there was a noticeable shrimp in each and every dumpling.  3 stars.    Why were the pan fried ones smushed, like flattened?  I have never seen them served like that.  They also weren't that crispy.  2 stars.   The cucumber side dish (referred to as a salad) was passable.  2 stars.    I don't know why the guy took away our cucumber plate so quickly when we hadn't even finished eating.  1 star.    If this is a solid four star in Montreal, I feel sad for Montrealers.  Montreal isn't known for Chinese food anyways."}
{"text":"The dumplings are really good! You can get them either steamed or fried, and you can also have them hand-made! The appetizers were delicious as well.   The environment is very casual, and we were lucky to have come early because the room filled up quickly! It seems to be popular with the locals, which was a good sign for tourists like my friend and myself.   I give three stars because the server seemed very rushed in the way she was talking to us, while we would have preferred a gentler touch to the service.   Furthermore, she was rather dismissive of our attempts to speak French, and clearly (and not politely) switched to English. (Surely our French can't be that bad?) As a visitor to Canada and Quebec, I do try to show respect for the language, even if we ultimately end up speaking English out of convenience."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for a week and ended up going here several times for lunch as we were so impressed with the quality of the food. Best dumplings I have eaten for awhile. I recommend the veggie (#35) steamed and the lamb and cumin pan fried. Simple fare, but each order is made fresh. They give you 15 dumplings per order, but saw that they split an order for another customer which is nice if you want to try more than one type and just don't have a big enough belly.  Note that they have moved next door to their old location."}
{"text":"the location is a hole in the wall...not a place you want to be if you are into the ambiance.   having said that, I am ALL about food and it is worth 5 stars for me. My family and I were in Montreal for 3 days and stumbled upon this tiny little dumpling place. OMG! I have been in North America for almost 20 years, and this is one of the best dumplings I ever had here in this continent. There are both deep fried and steamed dumplings. they are both good. However, if I have to pick one, I have to give the winner to the steamed dumplings. There are juicy broth in those steam dumplings, and the ingredients are also very flavorful. We ordered 4 dishes (2 adults and 2 kids) and we finished them all. The steamed pork dumplings are great. So are the deep fried with lamb meat.  I really miss this place! Please consider open a branch in Seattle, WA."}
{"text":"I have dreams about these dumplings. I walk by twice a day on my way to and from work and it takes every ounce of strength in my being to not pop in for some shrimp, egg and leek dumplings. I tried making them at home once to satisfy the craving but there's no way any other dumpling could compare.  I highly recommend lamb and coriander, pork and mushroom, leek, shrimp, and egg, leek, shrimp, pork, and egg, curried beef and onion (fried! oh my gosh is it good). They still taste amazing even after you and your friend polish off a total of 8 plates between the two of you. I'm not even ashamed to admit that.  Great for a cheap, quick meal. The place is usually packed but I've never found the service to be particularly slow. The staff is really friendly, and they don't even look at you weirdly when you look them straight in the eye without even opening the menu and order 3 plates of number 22 (leek, shrimp and egg!)"}
{"text":"I had been craving dumplings for quite a long time when I finally decided to give this restaurant a shot. What a great idea that was!   I visited this tiny traditional chinese restaurant along with a friend, and we ordered two dishes of dumplings to share. We tried the boiled Beef and coriander dumplings, and the fried zucchini and pork ones.  Each plate contained 15 dumplings, and we were more than satisfied with the two dishes.  Both were de-li-cious, to my humble opinion (Although i am not necessarily a connoisseur in chinese food, so do not quote me on this!).   My favourite out of the two dishes was definitely the fried pork dumplings - They were crisp, the filling was delicious and, basically, a pleasure in the mouth.   The servers automatically serve tea to accompany the dumplings - Great bonus for students on a budget!  Can I add that everything cost me less than 10 bucks? AMEN!"}
{"text":"This tiny shop in the beginning of chinatown serves incredible dumplings that rival the best Montreal has to offer. We shared huge plates of pork &leek dumplings, lamb and green onion and pork & shrimp. The first two were by far the best and the combination of flavours was simply divine!"}
{"text":"The best dumpling that i ever had since I came to Canada. I'm serious. They use such fresh material and it taste amazing.Everyone should have a try! Highly recommend the pork mushroom shrimp!"}
{"text":"In October 2014, I went to Montreal. Every night since, I've dreamt of Mai's dumplings."}
{"text":"Friday night out on the town, and before catching some music at Katacombs, thought we'd grab a bite since we were near Chinatown. The line at the noodle place down the street was super long, so we decided to try our luck at the dumpling spot instead. Thankfully, no line, and we were seated right away. Strange, we thought, for a Friday night, but no complaints there. Ordered the seaweed salad, the steamed lamb and onion dumplings and the steamed shrimp pork and leek dumplings. Everything tastes wonderful. Our gripe was the service. The server insisted we get full orders of both dumplings (as opposed to the option where you can split the order into two flavors), saying that one plate wasn't enough for two people. Well when we received our orders, we'll, there were 30 dumplings total. And I don't know about you, but that's a lot of dumplings between two people. In other words, we felt like we got hustled so that the server could make an extra buck. And we actually felt a little sick afterwards cause we ate too much. But whatever. Let's just get our bill. Except the server hadn't even checked on us since we got our food. No \"everything okay?\" or \"would you like more tea?\" Basic stuff. Anyways, just went straight to the cashier to pay for my bill (which I HATE doing at a restaurant - former waiter pet peeve), and that was that. All that to say, the food was great, but the experience left a little to be desired, and there are enough dumpling spots in this town for me to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was busy.  It probably only seats 20-30 people at most.   We ordered pork and chive dumplings pan fried and shrimp and pork dumplings steamed.   The latter was much better. I usually love pan fried dumplings (war-tip) but these were a huge disappointment and I would not recommend.   Very good value but you gotta love dumplings."}
{"text":"I had the pork, shrimp, leek and egg for lunch (steamed). 1 plate was plenty!  They were yummy. They were perfectly tender and delicious. I wish I could have tried another kind but the only option seems to be to order 15 at a time. Thx to yelpers for explaining how to use the little saucer and condiments on the table to mix a little dipping sauce. I had the cucumber salad which was ok - visually it was a little off-putting since it was the smaller Persian cucumbers, that were more crushed than chopped. It was tart and a little spicy. Prices were very reasonable (~$9 for dumplings and $1-2 for salads). The fried versions of dumplings looked pan-fried not deep fried. Cash only for less than $20. They were fairly busy for lunch on a tues. but no wait. Service was a little slow but there was only 1 woman doing everything - taking orders, delivering food and collecting cash. There were 3 ladies at the back, making dumplings by hand!"}
{"text":"IN SHORT:  2/5 Hole in the wall northern Chinese dumpling joint with average offerings.  If you are in a craving for Chinese dumplings, this place may satisfy.   FOOD:  2.5/5 Unlike the previous reviews, the menu offerings are significantly paired down. Pooled noodles are no longer offered.  They do not even have the steamed soup dumplings, Shaio Long Bao (???). DUMPLINGS, BOILED:  Pork / Sour Cabbage  The dumpling wraps are clearly hand made.  As a matter of fact, you can see a few ladies behind the glass partition in the kitchen hand wrapping the dumplings.  The flavors are good.  The wraps are a bit past \"al dente\" to near mushy. DUMPLINGS, BOILED:  Lamb Good texture to the filling and slight acidity hinting at the lamb. DUMPLINGS, PAN FRIED:  Pork Once again, the lack of gluten development of the wrapping makes the outside less solid and crisp as could be.  AMBIANCE / SERVICE:  2/5 Hole in the wall with an attempt at Chinese decor.  Service is not obstrusive.  LOCATION / PARKING:  2/5 Parking is metered city street in Chinatown  WHEELCHAIR ACCESS:  0.5/5 Large / high step at front door that is uneven, making it difficult for one person assisted entry."}
{"text":"I had been reading about authentic Chinese places and how to spot one. This place meets the criteria: home made chili oil, black vinegar on the tables, Chinese patrons, cash only, and no water unless you ask. We had the pork and cabbage dumplings in soup and the pork, coriander, and shrimp dumplings fried. Both were really good, not doughy and very flavorful. The price was very good too. I already want to come back to Montreal all the way from Los Angeles just to eat here."}
{"text":"Considering the small place, the 6 of us got seated pretty quickly. We quickly ordered 6 different types of dumplings. They make a good variety/ steamed or fried on the spot. Doesn't seem like anything was pre-made. Not all the dumplings we ordered suited my taste ie. beef curry, one with cilantro but others a seemed to like it. I enjoyed the pork with cabbage the best."}
{"text":"Apres une forte envie de dumpling, avec mon copain on a regardé sur yelp pour trouver un bon restaurant et on est tombé sur celui la avec de très bons commentaires. Situé dans le quartier chinois, ce petit restaurant ne paye vraiment pas de mine ce qui en fait ressortir son authenticité! À peine entré, le serveur nous assigne une table nous la pointant du doigt puis nous apporte on ne sait quoi dans une théière. Ca ne goûtait rien de particulier mais ça n'était pas mauvais. On a commandé chacun un plat de 15 dumplings et une soupe avec 10 dumplings dedans. On pouvait clairement voir les cuisinières preparer les dumplings au fur et à mesure des commandes. Donc pas de doute sur la fraîcheur! Nos plats sont arrivés assez rapidement, attention c'est chaud, et on a juste ADORÉ! Dumplings succulents, dans lesquels on sent vraiment bien les différents ingrédients. La soupe est simple mais bonne. Il y avait également sur la table une petite sauce pimentée très goûteuse et qui accompagnait bien les dump'! Pour la prochaine fois, on saura que une assiette de 15 dump' chacun suffira mais on a quand même tout fini tellement c'était bon! Je reviendrais souvent et je recommande à tous les amateurs de dumplings!"}
{"text":"The new and improved Mai Xiang Yuan, aka Raviolis Mai Xiang, in Ctown Montréal is better than I remember when I visited several years ago. Re-established right next to the old and abandoned restaurant, the new 2.0 is nicely decorated with slightly more seating. What's more appealing is that now they have a new dumpling mascot rooting for Mai Xiang. The food has also reached a new level of tastiness as well. With variety of proteins and vegetables available in addition to different methods of preparation, these dumplings can satisfy even the most difficult cynic. Till this day, Mai Xiang stands strong and upholds a respectable standard of quality and service despite few entry level competitors around the block."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall. Service was great. The dumplings  were freshly prepared by ladies in back. The dumplings were very tender and the portion size was large. I was unable to finish my order. The place was very busy."}
{"text":"Mai Xiang Yuan is a perfect place to get a hot bowl of dumplings in soup or dumplings fried to perfection on a cold day, which is pretty much everyday in Montreal. The menu is simple enough, as they only serve dumplings. I love fried dumplings with vinegar, so this place did not disappoint. I was actually surprised to discover that I could eat like 12  dumplings by myself.   I think if they could improve on one thing, it would be offering noodle dishes to compliment the dumplings.   I liked that they offered a wide range of fillings from pork to corn and veggies. You can also buy the dumplings frozen to bring home and make yourself.   Service was just ok, but I do believe they are cash only. There are also a few dessert and boba shops in the area for when you're finished with your dumplings."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. The dumplings are delicious and made fresh to order. Just with they had a variety plate, so we could try more flavors. Our favorite is the pork, coriander, and shrimp dumpling. You can get them fried or boiled. The boiled dumplings have the best flavor, because the frying oil can detract from the flavor of the dumplings."}
{"text":"Solid dumplings. No frills. Don't be a fool, eat the dumplings"}
{"text":"awful service. the guy always find excuses to prevent you from paying by credit card. food quality is nowhere near satisfactory"}
{"text":"Overall: Excellent dumplings!  I had the lamb and onion fried dumplings.  A litle bit oily but that's what you get for ordering the fried ones.  Next time I'll try the dumpling soup (there will definitely be a next time).  Price: Price was $8-10 before tax/tip for a plate of 15 dumplings, which was enough food for lunch.  They also have a few small salads for $1 each; might as well add some variety to your lunch for a buck!  Ambiance: A bit rushed and somewhat cramped, as is often the case for Chinatown lunch.  Not terrible though by any means.  And the service was pretty fast and polite.  The place is clean and nice on the inside.  Not the place for a business meeting, perfect for a lunch with colleagues or friends."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars not because I actually tasted the food but because it looked good enough for me to actually come back and try it, which I did NOT get to do on my first visit. Why not? Crappy service. Could not get waitstaff to make eye contact. Waited half an hour and while all the tables around us were getting served (even people that walked in way after us) we were still waiting. Had to leave because I couldn't have enjoyed the food even if it was the best ever. That being said, I'm sure their dumplings are good, just based on what I saw. Be prepared for rude inattentive service and a long wait and you'll probably enjoy it, if you can deal with that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I challenge everyone of my YELPER friends out there to find a better restaurant that serves fresh \"made to order\" dumplings. These delicious little bundles are packaged by hand and delivered hot with friendly & fast service.   Now I hope your not expecting anything fancy because this little 15 table restaurant is your quintessential \"hole-in-the-wall\"! You don't have fancy art, the wallpaper is torn, the bathrooms are not spotless but their dumplings are magic!  We ordered 3 types of boiled dumplings; pork & cabbage, pork & leek, and lamb. We also ordered the fried beef & curry dumplings b/c our server said they were tastier than the boiled. All came hot and steamy to our table on plates with no added decorations or garnishes. They were just simply DELISH!  After all that I just couldn't get enough dumplings if you can believe it so I ordered soup with dumplings too. I meant to order \"soup dumplings\" but somehow it got lost in translation so I had delicious broth with pork dumplings. Still, vey good.  Dinner for 4 was under $60 with tip including free tea. Oh yeah, FREE tea!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the great reviews, we were really looking forward to this place. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.  First, it was 90 degrees in Montreal and this restaurant had no AC. It was sweltering  and sweat was pouring off of all of us as we waited for our food.   The service was terribly slow--in fact another customer ended up giving us his menu when he realized we had been seated, but had not been visited by our waiter. Normally with service this slow, I would have walked out, but the promise of delicious dumplings kept me from leaving.   Finally our order arrived and my boyfriend and I just stared at it. The pan fried dumplings we had been waiting all day to try were stuck together and burned. We took a couple of bites and the taste just wasn't right. It was bland and dry.   My recommendation, visit Oh Dumpling just a block away. It's a much better experience."}
{"text":"During my brief one-night stay in Montreal this time (I'm a repeat visitor...I LOVE Montreal!), I wanted to sample something from Montreal's Chinatown. Earlier in the afternoon while walking about I scouted out some potential choices, and this place caught my attention with their dumpling offerings. (I had not pre-researched anywhere beforehand...this was just walk-around research.) As dinnertime approached, I returned here and found the place crowded, but since I was solo this trip I just decided to order my meal to-go and enjoy it at my nearby hotel.  I chose an order of Pork & Shrimp with Coriander dumplings, and an order of Beef & Onion dumplings. Each order comes 15 per order, for $7.99 each order. The dumplings are prepared fresh to order; I returned 15 minutes after placing my order and it was ready to go. Both varieties I chose definitely lived up to expectations; they were fresh and tasty on their own, and the 2 dipping sauces (soy-based, and hot-chili based) were complementary as well.  I would definitely return again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Came in with high expectations from all the good reviews here, but I guess I left kind of disappointed. The dumplings in the soup I ordered were ok, but the broth was basically just water with some veggies in it, nothing special. After the soup I ordered some fried lamb dumplings with coriander but these were served burnt and stuck together and were also just ok. What am I missing here?"}
{"text":"Location: On the main below René-Lévesque, and coincidentally, right next to my favorite Pho place - My Canh. Take the subway or walk because you'll never find parking.  Decor & Service: The new place is 3x bigger than the old place and guess what? NO carpet! It's much cleaner and there is more room to move around, unlike the previous place which was super cramped. You don't have as good a view of the dumpling ladies now, but if you stand right at the cash, you can see them in action. The cashier might give you strange looks though.  Food: I ordered the steamed pork+shrimp+coriander dumplings and they were delicious. Freshly made and steaming hot, these dumplings were like little baskets of soupy goodness that I literally inhaled, they were so good. The dumplings were super flavorful and you could taste the fresh coriander - definitely a plus because I love coriander.  I can guarantee fresh dumplings at this place - if you don't believe me, stop by and see for yourself. The lovely ladies in the kitchen prepare each dumpling by hand, (almost) right on front of you. Just peek through that plexiglass and watch the magic happen.  Price: Pretty fair - for 15 good-size dumplings, it'll cost you a whopping $8.49+tax."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings.  The standard if there ever was one.  Delicious.  Minus a point for the hole in the wall atmosphere, which was rough and unclean, even for Chinatown standards."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've had almost everything on the menu and I was never disappointed. I usually get the lamb and coriander, and the pork and leek, fried or steamed."}
{"text":"Good but not worthy of the 4 star rating. We had the vegetarian - fried mung bean and mushroom dumplings as well as the fried pork and mushroom. While we enjoyed them, they just weren't that great. It seemed as though the soy sauce and vinegar were watered down as well. I think the dumplings would have been better with a more robust dipping sauce but it is what it is."}
{"text":"So happy that a second location of this awesome dumpling shop has opened downtown near Guy/Concordia metro! Was totally empty when I went, and I think it's because people are not yet aware of this location. It is larger than the one in Chinatown, which is a nice plus. Menu looks the same as the Chinatown location. $8.99 for 15 beef and coriander dumplings. I have tried pretty much every \"soupy\" dumpling place many times (Qing Hua, Fortune Dumpling, takeout from certain small markets that make it to order) and Mai is definitely in my top two. They have the edge because of the amount of meat and quality of meat they put in each dumpling (well stuffed and no cartilage or chewy parts in the meat like many other places) AND the price! Also, the dumpling wrapper they make is divine! It still has a bite to it but is super smooth and has a hint of sweetness to it that I love. Other places have a thicker, more doughy wrapper that I don't like as much. They have a small appetizer section with prices of $2.99-$3.99. Like the old school places, this resto offers free tea (just how it should be haha) unlike the rest of the Asian places near Guy in \"Chinatown 2\".  Service was also very nice. Will be back many times (won't be good for the waistline!)"}
{"text":"Love the steam pork and mushroom dumplings. They only take cash and they don't serve hot tea. Overall the dumplings is really fresh."}
{"text":"This became my favorite place for dumplings. We had the pork/shrimps/coriander dumplings and the eggs/shrimps/leeks, steamed to perfection and the price is very reasonable. Service is fast and the tea is served quickly. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes dumplings."}
{"text":"At this price, I wasn't expecting much.  It was ok, not gooooooood, but ok+. This place turns plates like crazy, it's always busy. The only dish I had issue with was the soup dumpling. I ordered thinking they were soup dumpling, not dumpling in soup.   That's my bad. Once I saw the bowl I was like ''Well ok'' But the broth was tasteless. I ended up eating the dumpling but left the soup.  The spicy cucumber salad was great. I can't believe the sides are this cheap!  I would go back with friends, but I would stay clear of the dumpling soup."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place due to all the great reviews. Maybe I was spoiled as a kid because my moms handmade dumplings were an often part of my childhood...but I was not insanely impressed. They were still good though!   First off, this place is gritty and cheap. Appetizers are a mere $3-$4 and each dumpling dish is around $7-8 for 15 dumplings. It doesn't look like they accept credit card and they do a 1.2 exchange rate instead of the current 1.36.   The most common ones everyone ordered was the pot sticker like dumplings. They looked delicious from pictures but were a little dry inside. The steamed dumplings were my favorite. Unfortunately they ran out of soup dumplings :( We tried everything from pork, beef, and lamb. Def go with the pork options that have a star next to them.  Overall this place is a good but my moms homemade dumplings are similar. If you've never had authentic Chinese dumplings, you would probably love this place!"}
{"text":"A friend recently back from Asia recommended this place. I tried it on a Friday evening early, and it was good!  We had a cucumber salad to start, which was refreshing, crunchy and delicious.  For dumplings, we tried pork and mushroom, and lamb and coriander (I think) steamed dumplings, plus curried beef fried dumplings. They were all very fresh, and tasty.  But I can't give the place 5 stars because I was disappointed with the tastes. I was excited to try the lamb, but frankly I found them a touch bland. I noticed one of the reviews here says that the person couldn't taste the difference between the different types, and I can understand that. I have to say also that compared to the soup dumplings at Qing Hua, they really weren't as good.  I would however go back just to see if it wasn't an off day. Seriously, they were good, but there was something missing to my mind."}
{"text":"Went after reading Yelp reviews. Absolutely perfect pork/shrimp/leek/egg dumplings Nothing is pre-prepared Not a hint of grease Dumplings and won ton soups only Cheap"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place with one of my bestfriends and it was pretty good we wanted something yummy and we stopped for dumplings, nothing crazy but they were good. I had curry ones and steamed ones were pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork, shrimp & coriander (fried) and it was maybe the best dumplings I ever had. I've been thinking about them for weeks."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles where there are several tasty dumpling spots, this place tops them all. I got the shrimp, pork, leek, and egg and the pork & mushroom. Hands down, best dumplings ever!"}
{"text":"Home style dumplings. I tried both steamed n fried dumplings. I think steam is better as fried ones were a bit oily."}
{"text":"Three full days in Montreal. We ate here twice. What was it that got us coming back?, Yelp asks. The food, and only the food. The service was atrocious.  And yet - four stars, all because those delicious steamed or pan-fried balls of meat and veggies more than made up for the lack of service. As my husband jokingly said on our way there the second night, \"We're on our way to delicious dumplings and horrible service!\"  So, night one - we found this place because of Yelp (thanks, fellow Yelpers!) It was within walking distance from our hotel, and it was open. We showed up at about 7 pm that night, and though they were kind of full, we were given a table near the window right away.  That's about as good as it got, as far as service goes. We were at the table for maybe two minutes - menus open, in the middle of discussing what we'd like to order - when we were rudely interrupted by one of the waitresses demanding our order. And it was a demand, too. Nothing kind or nice about it. \"What you order?!\", she barked at us, as we stared up at her in amazement.   My husband - ever the diplomat - politely told her that we'd need a few more minutes. She turned on her heel and stamped away before we could ask for beverages.   Once we finally decided what we wanted - one order of the curried beef, pan fried, and one order of the steamed pork and pickled cabbage - we were left to sit. We had to flag a waitress down, and even then, she got distracted halfway to our table. Our request for green tea was flatly denied - something about \"not having it\" that night - and our back-up request for water was ignored for almost ten minutes.  The wait for the food that night was interminable, as well. I was two minutes from getting up to ask about our order when the first plate appeared in front of us (dropped like it was hot while the waitress scurried away). We were left with no chopsticks and no napkins, and of course it took several minutes to get someone's attention for that.  The first plate we were given was the pork and pickled cabbage. Every plate comes with 15 dumplings. Fifteen hot, delectable packets of goodness. And let me tell you people - it IS goodness!  Every table has a selection of sauces, which allows you to concoct your own brew. Shoyu, vinegar, chili oil - it all went into my little dish, and it was divine!  I rather enjoyed the pan-fried curry dumplings, but my husband was more about the boiled version. They were both truly delicious, and took some of the sting out of the horrible service.  Paying is quite the adventure. You're not given a check - you're expected to go to the register. Once there, the distracted guy (who was on the phone both times we paid) will pluck a receipt from his till and present it to you to pay. He was right both times - bully for him - but again, don't expect any kind of friendliness or thanks for the business.  Oh yes - they're a cash only establishment. They have an ATM right at the entrance, so that's handy.  Second night there was more of the same as far as service goes (with less reason, as it wasn't nearly as packed the first time we went). We did two orders of the boiled dumplings this time, and they were just as delicious.  And let me tell you - it may not look like a lot, but two orders (30 dumplings) fills a person up. Even a glutton like me!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place.  The pork and leek dumplings are absolutely amazing boiled and, when they have it, their rice tea is to die for.  Cash only but they have their own ATM inside.  Seriously my favourite place to go when I am looking for good food at good prices with no frills (under $20 for 30 dumplings)."}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in dumplings.  Not the large ones, but the ravioli-sized ones.  We read some good reviews which helped us decide to go there.  The service was good, we were greeted right away after entering.  It was fairly busy, so we figured this was a good choice until we saw the menu.  If you want ravioli-sized dumplings, this place is great, anything else, don't bother.  There was nothing on the menu that our 6 year old was interested in, but the waitress was kind enough to bring some cherries for him!  The appetizer we ordered had too much seasoning, the pork egg and mushroom dumplings were great, but the dumpling soup we ordered had no flavor.  We ended up adding hot sauce and soy sauce to give it some.  The topper was that they don't take credit or debit cards.  So, dumplings and service good, the rest not so much."}
{"text":"They make the dumplings fresh right there and you can see them through a glass window stuffing the dumplings by one. The restaurant itself is a whole in the wall and it could be cleaner but the dumplings are fantastic. They have a special hot sauce that tasted so good with the dumplings, it wasn't too hot and it has a sweet taste to it. Definitely recommend it if you want to grab a quick bite. They only take cash."}
{"text":"Dumplings were very tasty and fresh! We had one plate of fried and one plate of steamed dumplings. Both good!  Service is what you'd expect. The waitress was sure to tell us that \"the tip wasn't included\"! It was everything I could do to avoid giving her the tip that \"service was not her calling\"! Price is good.  *floor is VERY slippery in the winter. Be careful!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was on my list of places to stop on my recent trip to Montreal due to Yelper reviews. If I hadn't been looking for it, I wouldn't even have noticed this tiny spot in the middle of busy Chinatown.  We got in late in the afternoon around 2 and the place was empty. There were 3 ladies in the kitchen window and one waitress that greeted us and brought us tea and menus. We ordered the curry beef and onion dumplings fried, and pork, shrimp leek and egg steamed. The steamed came out first. They were the perfect temperature to pop in your mouth whole without burning yourself. Light, full of fresh filling and lightly seasoned, I could have eaten these all day.  The curry beef were hot due to the pan frying but the waitress warned us so we munched happily on the pork while they cooled a bit. The beef was perfectly seasoned with curry, crispy, juicy and so flavorful they didn't even require dipping sauce! The fresh dough is soft and slightly chewy and the perfect thickness to hold in the goodies inside while not giving you just a mouthful of dough.  Each table has vinegar, soy sauce and hot pepper oil so you can mix your own custom dipping sauces.  For 2 huge plates of dumplings it was under $20. Add in the free tea and this was a perfect meal for little cash."}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat my cheat meal here ....the food was alright but definitely not worth the hype and the service was basic ...anyways i enjoyed the soup"}
{"text":"Dumplings! I came to this place after a recommendation from a fellow foodie. I didn't realize there was a second location of Mai Xiang Yuan right in the downtown neighborhood. When I went it was empty except for my friends and I. We got right down to business and ordered 3 different types of dumplings. I got the pork, coriander and shrimp dumplings while my bf and friend got the lamb and coriander, and shrimp and egg. All were boiled, all were delicious. The filling and ingredients all tasted fresh and well cooked. We also ordered appetizers like jellyfish and cucumber salad. It tasted more on the saltier end and the jellyfish combination gave the salad  the perfect texture I'd say.  Would I come back? Yes. Would I recommend this place? Yes. Totally."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. This place was small and busy but authentic.  To start, we ordered #34, persian cucumber with carrot salad. It was ok. 3/5  #18, boiled dumplings with pork, mushroom and shrimp. It was delicious. 5/5  #7, pan fried dumplings with pork and cabbage. It was ok. The outside wasn't crispy enough. 3/5"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers for the reviews!  I was not disappointed with Mai Xiang Yuan's delectable dumplings... they were truly the best I've ever had.  I also order the cucumber salad, which was just okay.    Be mindful that at lunchtime, the places is packed to the brim.  Although the food was super good, the service could be much improved.  I realize it was lunchtime and crazy busy, but it took my waiter 15 minutes from the time I sat down to bring me a glass of water.  After that it took another 10 minutes for him to take my order and then 15 more minutes to receive my meal.    I suggest munching on a small packet of peanuts before sitting down for lunch here if you are starving.  It will be a while before you get your food."}
{"text":"Tried this place because it is the same restaurant as the other one in Chinatown (1082 Boulevard Saint-Laurent, Montreal, QC H2Z 1J5) It was around 10pm and the waitress let us know that they only had 4 dumping choices left.  We ordered the pork,shrimp, and leek fried which adds 1.50$ to the price.  Food was served really fast. The dumplings were decent, quality was the same as the other restaurant which is a really good sign. The service was quick and rushed (because they were closing at midnight and they wanted to close the kitchen early I guess.)   I enjoyed my time here and think the dumplings are good enough given the price. I can't really vouch for the authenticity of the cuisine but I liked it and would go back.  Tip: Cash Only, there is an ATM and it adds 1.50$ to withdraw"}
{"text":"Dumplings here are amazing! My favorite is the fried pork, shrimp and coriander. It's a must order! Boiled version is good as well. One thing to note is they do not steam their dumplings here.  Service I find is decent and quick. Though their dumplings are not as juicy as Qing Hua, I prefer it that way. It all depends on your preference. Atmosphere is cozy. The restaurant is small and not very noticeable from the outside. Located in Chinatown, this place is worth checking out if you like dumplings."}
{"text":"First of all , the inside need A Lot  of ventilation ! It is Hot and humid ! We ordered the lamb and celery dumpling , after the food finally came we realize it was lamb and chives.  After we told the waitress that they made an error this isn't what we ordered , the waitress immediately said \"no you are wrong this IS lamb and celery!\" until I have to open one in front of her. She then said \"well the kitchen made a mistake then , are you ok with eating this ? I mean do you have to have the one you ordered ?\"   ......ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?!? After another 30 min of wait the right food came, the waitress almost slammed the food on my table, walked away without saying a word .... The food itself is good, maybe worth 4 stars but the service is worth ZERO star....  So if you like dumplings and happen to come across this place , order take out. So overall I am sorry to say I have to give it a 2 out of 5."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. For 8-10 dollars, you can get these scrumptious little dumplings. They cost a little extra to get them pan fried, and they look like gyoza. I had the veggie one with baby shrimp. asked if I could have it in soup, but they said they couldn't do that for me; they only had the other meat ones that came in soup. Honestly, how hard could it be to put the shrimp ones in broth?!  Anyway, they are tasty. Beware  if you're looking for variety, though; it's literally all they serve. Dumplings."}
{"text":"As with many hole in a wall places, this one was outstanding. Authentic Chinese dumpling place right in the heart of Montreals Chinatown. While small, service was fast and people were nice. I had steamed pork, leek shrimp and egg dumpling which was magnificent! I also had pork, shrimp and coriander fried which was also good; although I recommend the boiled dumplings more."}
{"text":"To sum it up:  *Holy dumplings Batman! *I ate way too many, couldn't  stop. *Go for steamed, anything with shrimp is guaranteed awesomeness, trust me. *Chili oil is tasty. *Amazing value for your money. *Mah belly is happy!"}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings served fresh. Try the affordable appetizers too!  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised to read the raving review on Yelp. Every other dumpling place I have been to in Montreal had better dumplings. The four kinds we tried here were palatable but nowhere near as good as other nearby places.  The seaweed salad was OK. The dishes and decore are nice too.  The service was all-right, but we were asked to pay (and leave) less than an hour after walking in - we had no idea they close as early as 10pm on Saturday night - most downtown restaurants stay open until later.  I wish we chose better - but were starving and didn't check the closing time when we walked in (- and the staff didn't inform us of them as well).  I probably won't be back - with so many Chinese restaurant in town, there's no reason to return here."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. I tried 3 varieties of dumpling the other day (all of them fried) and they were amazing! The skins thinner and more delicate than many other places, and the filling savory enough to come through in a somewhat smaller package. We tried the pork/pickled cabbage, poark/shrimp/coriander; and the pork/leek/shrimp/egg. My favorite were the ones with coriander, while the most subtle ones were the ones with egg. I would order any of them again, and ate all of the dumplings I plopped onto my plate - then stole one from my sister's. I'm thinking I might just slowly try all the varieties and work my way through the menu. I'm kind of glad my go-to place for dumplings near Concordia shut down, I've discovered a new favorite! NB: this is a cash only place, although they do have an ATM."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are good and plentiful! I had the boiled leek and pork dumplings and they were just as they should be - piping hot, juicy  and savory. It's a great value for the price and is a nice get away from the somewhat expensive foods that Montreal has to offer. Definitely a Chinatown gem. If you have a hankering for good dumplings, do stop by and come hungry! You will be greatly satisfied and full after."}
{"text":"This dumpling spot is located in Montreal Chinatown and was conveniently located a block away from our hotel. We visited for an in-between snack.  Decor/Ambiance 3/5 Typical crowded Chinese spot. This place was pretty crowded when we got there and loud.   Service- 3/5 The staff allowed us to split a single order (which was surprisingly expensive, especially compared to NYC prices) into two different types, which was a plus. However, when the dumplings arrived, we didn't get our own plates to put the dumplings on. Meh.  Food- 4/5 We ordered the mushroom and pork/leek dumplings. They arrived hot and fresh. Be careful so as to not burn yourself. They tasted pretty good, but weren't the best I ever had.  Bottom line- Good for a little snack. Relatively expensive though."}
{"text":"Very good dumplings. Suggest getting them fried."}
{"text":"One of the best dumplings I've ever had... wide range to choose from, fried or steamed.. staff rly nice.. cant biy by credit card but they have atm on the spot."}
{"text":"Just writing about this place is making me drool. The Yelpers have spoken- This is truly the Best dumpling spot in town. Take anything, mostly steamed, try one fried. Don't over do it, it's 15 dumplings a pop, and enjoy yourselves.  Tip: after eating, go to a Chinese grocery store and try a fruit you never tried before."}
{"text":"One of several Chinese dumpling places in what I like to call the \"China-town west\" neighborhood (AKA Shaughnessy Village). Nice place, pretty empty at four in the  afternoon... My server was very friendly and was easy to communicate with.   The menu offered many of the familiar varieties of \"traditional\" fried or boiled/steamed dumplings with pork, beef, lamb, shrimp, tofu, and various vegetables. I was pleased to note that they offered several vegetarian (5 varieties) and vegan (4 varieties) friendly dumplings, although, it should be noted, that as with most of the other Asian doling places I have been to, shrimp is considered a \"vegetable\". I also double checked for my vegan friends, and can confirm the wrapper of the non-meat dumplings contain NO EGG.  I sampled two of their boiled vegetarian dumpling offerings: #46, Tofu & cabbage and #47, corn with edamame & carrot. I preferred #46 personally in both texture and flavor, but both where very good, much better than other dumplings I have had in the past that where filled with bland glass noodles (I mean *really* who wants a noodle filled with noodles???)  They took a bit of time getting to the table, but I assume that it just meant they where very fresh! And they where piping hot when they arrived. The order had 15 dumplings and the bill came to under $12 with tax.  I would go there again."}
{"text":"C'était mon baptême de dumpling au restaurant rien a voir avec les congelés du super marché.nous avons essayé au porc crevette et coriandre et buf oignon curry. Délicieux, super juteux et plein de saveur. Très abordable en plus, j'y retournerai c'est sur."}
{"text":"It was so yummy and affordable. Each order comes in 10 or 15 pieces. If you had $1, you can have 2 types of dumplings, so you can enjoy a different kind if you didn't come with a big group. The pork, shrimp and coriander dumplings was recommended by the owner. We also also the pork and leek dumplings. Both kinds pan fried. We also ordered the beef and coriander soup dumplings. Everything was better than I expected. I can't give it a 5 star because I prefer my dumplings with thin skin."}
{"text":"Je viens de commander dumpings fried au beoef et coriandre...je suis vraiment déçu avec..ça prendre 20mins..très longtemps!! Enplus mes dumplings sont même po bien cuit...je crois que je ne reviens plus dans ce petit Resto ...."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered boiled pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings, along with steamed beef and onion dumplings. The pork dumplings were delicious, but the beef dumplings were another story. As in any other dumpling restaurant, the steamed dumplings came in a wooden container, and they were laid on a non-stick paper. The onion overpowered the taste of beef, and a select few began to stick to the paper. Pulling on them, the dumplings would rip open, letting the soup leak out and pass through the cracks of the container. Unlike other restaurants, there was no base to the container to capture escaping liquids. Therefore, it spilled onto the table.   The staff were very friendly, and the service was relatively quick. Yet I'd prefer to wait a little longer for my food in exchange for better quality, which is why I'm sticking to Qing Hua."}
{"text":"We use to live in China, and these were as authentic as they could be.  They are made fresh when you order them.  The orders come in 15, and it's a $1.50 more if you want them fried.  These are northern style dumplings, as the style changes depending on what part of China you are in.  So friggen good.  Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious made-to-order dumplings!! For less that $10/pp you can fill up on a variety of steamed or pan fried dumplings. I ate here twice during an extended weekend visit and my favorites by far are the 1) pork, shrimp and mushroom steamed dumplings and 2) lamb and onion pan fried dumplings. Both kinds are super flavorful and come out piping hot. You can mix and match dumpling types for an extra charge but it's totally worth it to be able to try different kinds. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The menu is ultra simple: just two kinds of simple salads and steamed or fried dumplings. There are a good variety of dumplings though and they are cheap. Our favorite was the unusual beef and curry flavor. Between the four of us we ate 45 dumplings!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars- I never leave reviews and especially not bad ones but I was so upset by my experience I felt the need to.  This place is very traditional, we found it through yelp and a Montreal guidebook.  I loved the cucumber salad.  I don't eat meat so I was excited that they had vegetarian options.  I ordered an order of half shrimp dumplings and half mushroom, and my boyfriend ordered 1 order of lamb dumplings and 1 order of pork.  When the other waitress brought out two plates and when she handed one to me I asked specifically if these were mine and she said yes (we just assumed they forgot his second order and just let it be).  About 15 minutes later after we were almost finished they brought another plate and when I asked which was which they told me the plate I'd been eating had been lamb dumplings.  To clarify: I've never eaten red meat/lamb in my life so i don't know what that tastes like and I assumed they were mushroom ones like I ordered (since she told me as much).  I ended up having to get the food I ordered to go because I didn't feel like eating after that.  When I went up to ask for a to go box and told him that I didn't eat meat he tried to argue with me that she had told me which ones were which already, but then he talked to that waitress in Chinese and realized that it was her mistake.  He comped the lamb dumplings (I mean that's the least he could do) but unfortunately this is a mistake that can't be taken back..."}
{"text":"After having walked around Montreal for half a day, when we arrived in Chinatown we were famished.  Walking down Saint-Laurent the word \"dumpling\" literally jumped off their storefront.  Without a second thought we were inside enjoying a cold glass of water.  After looking over the menu we asked the waitress about steamed vs pan fried and how to know the difference on the menu.  Turns out you can order any of the dumplings prepared how you liked, nice!  We asked for an order of dumplings prepared each way, the vegie option steamed and the pork fried. Both were excellent.  On the table you have soy, vinegar and chili oil so you can mix the dipping sauce to your preference.  The only reason I took away a star is because it's cash only and we had to leave in order to use an ATM.  The shifty looking one in the doorway was our hint to ask about the use of credit cards and we ultimately used a legit bank ATM just around the corner."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings and for really cheap prices. Service could be a bit better but the food makes up so much more! :)"}
{"text":"For what it is, a dumpling store, this place cranks out really amazing dumplings.  Best I've had pretty much.  Your choice if you get them boiled or fried but my preference is for boiled.  They have an assortment of side salads that are worth investigating too.  My favorite is the cucumber salad.  Okay the decor is somewhat lacking and on a cold day you might not want to sit too close to the front door.  But if you're in pursuit of some really excellent dumplings this is the place."}
{"text":"This place really deserves 5 stars.  Excellent, succulent dumplings.  I had pork mushroom dumplings -- I really suggest them steamed (you have that option:  steamed or fried).  The portions look small, but are actually very filling.  From the appetizers we tried all -- and they were all good.  Especially the one with jellyfish, I never thought jellyfish would be that good."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise! We were walking down St Catherine's heading to a Lebanese restaurant when our son saw this place and decided he wanted dumplings instead. We started with three appetizers: peanut & celery, cucumber & jellyfish, and soy beef. All were outstanding. Then the dumplings started coming out and all were amazing. The price was reasonable and the food outstanding. I'll be returning here with friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place! Montreal at night was a little challenging to find a place we could go with kids - we stumbled upon this little gem in Chinatown, and had 2 very happy kids! There was a bit of a wait to get in but well worth it. Food is fresh and delicious, prices are very reasonable, and the service was wonderful (their internet was down, I went outside to find a bank machine while my family ate, and the waitress chased me down in the street to tell me not to worry, the internet was working again!) I would go back in a heartbeat, and feel so lucky we found it on our first night in Montreal...so we can go back!"}
{"text":"Good: the boiled version....we tried lamb...full of juice   Bad: the pan fried version...all the pictures are beautiful, however don't let it fool you, they are too try inside. The fried bottom is not that crisp, a little more to be desired...had better Chinese and Japanese version   Ambience: ok, for the price, it's good. 10 min wait in rush dinner time, a plus."}
{"text":"Yuuuuumyyy! Une des meilleures places à Dumpling que j'ai pu tester à Montréal! Un choix qui ne peux laisser personne sur la touche, et tellement savoureux, gouteux, juteux...  Qu'ils soient fris ou à la vapeur, le goût est bien là !   L'endroit ne paye pas de mine mais ne vous laissez pas avoir par la déco quelque peut \"fast food asiatique\", c'est dans l'assiette que ça se passe !!"}
{"text":"We came here looking for vegetarian dumplings and were somewhat disappointed. On the menu, there's a vegetarian section that lists three types of dumplings -- but two of them include seafood (shrimp). The only actually vegetarian dumpling on the menu is \"tomato and egg\", which I've never heard of before but sounds interesting. Alas, we couldn't even get that, because they were out! But the waitress went and conferred with the kitchen and reported back to us that there were mushroom, cabbage, and cellophane noodle-filled dumplings we could have instead.  We ordered one order fried and one boiled (15 dumplings per order). They were delicious: the skin is excellent -- not too thick, not too thin -- and the filling good but not really notable. The size was just right, too.  We also ordered the cucumber salad, which was good, although not properly chopped up (not a big deal, just kind of an amateur-hour move).   The general ambiance is not much to speak of, but it's not so bare bones as to feel unwelcoming/depressing.   They take credit cards, but charged us a 5% fee for our American card. They offered to take U.S. cash, which would have made sense for the exchange rate, but we didn't have enough of that on hand either.  As someone else mentioned, they don't serve tea, which is kind of a bummer. And FYI, they speak Mandarin here; our server also spoke good English and French."}
{"text":"Very good dumplings here (as the other reviewers all attest to), we got a variety & I recommend that as well; the service is friendly, but sloooooow.... It's worth a try, but do not be in a hurry. At all. Zzzzzzzz. They do not take credit cards-- I understand, but kind of a hassle. And no beer-- Tsing Tao *goes* with dumplings IMHO... Oh well."}
{"text":"Not the best dumplings in the city. They were not served on the steamer but on a plate so they quickly got soggy. The Fried Dumplings were not that great either - a bit burnt."}
{"text":"It's been SO long since I've had dumplings with homemade skin. Mai Xiang Yuan did such a great job with theirs - so chewy and fresh! Perfect with the hot sauce found on the table.   Between two people, we shared two appetizers - the cold cucumber salad and the jelly fish salad. The restaurant was incredibly stingy with the jellyfish, but flavor-wise, it was delicious.   For the dumplings, we went for 2 kinds. The pork and cabbage, and the shrimp, pork and mushroom.   The shrimp pork and mushroom was definitely our favorite. It had more complex flavors and textures, and was nothing short of a party in my mouth.   The pork and cabbage reminded me so much of xiao long bao's. The pork inside had a super super fine consistency and packed with juices. Each bite was practically bursting with simple but delicious comforting flavors.   We were really satisfied with our simple, homey dinner and I'd totally recommend this place for great homemade dumplings."}
{"text":"Literally the best dumplings of my life. Good grief. Per some of the reviews I read on here, my husband & I opted to get two sets of boiled dumplings and one fried. The fried actually ended up being way better than expected, and my husband wished we'd ordered more fried.   I was also a bit wary of the service because of some of the reviews I'd read on here. Maybe we caught them on a good night, but our server was excellent. She was sweet, knowledgable, quick to bring our order out (we waited less than 15 minutes for our food) and she even played with our two year old so mama could eat hands free for a second. ;)   Wish we were locals so we could enjoy this gem more often!"}
{"text":"New Years Eve and my man romances me at a whole in the wall spot in Montreal's Chinatown. I will give it up he tried calling 100 places last minute but NYE, similar to places in NYC fill up fast and have $100 tasting menus and the food is never as good if you go on any other night so, why not go cheap, quick and delicious and get to the bar more quickly to celebrate with some bubbles?!  First of all Montreal's Chinatown is great, same vibe as Chicago's. A few main streets chalk full of dumplings, bahn mi's, and other delicacies. The Yelp reviews were positive and Risa D stamped this one as the best so, done.  The dumplings were amazing. But, just a heads up, this place ONLY serves dumplings. There are a few salad apps but, you are here for the dumplings and dumplings only. We went with all steamed varieties ranging from pork and leek to lamb and coriander (!!!) and finished it off with beef and onion. With 15 dumplings per order and at about $7 per order you get a lot of bang for your buck. Sweet.   All were fabulous, I do want to highlight the lamb dumplings which I don't think I've ever had before and happened to be the winner winner chicken dinner of the meal. The other dumplings were just as great but the lamb had this extra kick to the meat. I also want to highlight that these dumplings were plump dumplings. Plump with juicy meat and with the skins being thin, the filling flavor really came through. Praise the dumpling lord, that's what I'm talking about. This place is super authentic with lovely lil' ladies in the back rollin' those dumplings as you eat. So fresh.  My one gripe was they wouldn't give us water. We asked twice. Water never came. Dumplings and sauce are pretty salty and the free hot tea is really nice but, I really wanted ice cold water man. Whyyyyyyy?  Regardless, this place was legit."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here twice.   Once we stopped in for lunch and had the pan fried dumplings and cucumber salad.   Another day we picked up an order of the steamed dumplings and took them up to our hotel's rooftop deck w/ a 6pack of beer.  The fried dumplings were quite good as was the cucumber salad, but in both of our opinions the steamed dumplings beat the pan fried dumplings hands down (which surprised us solely because the bulk of the people were ordering fried dumplings the day we ate lunch there).  The dumplings are made fresh on the spot, and you can see three women behind a glass window making them all as you sit at your table.       When we went for lunch it was packed, and took quite a while to get a table, and then another very long bit to get our dumplings.   It was well worth the wait though.    Surprisingly when we came in to make a togo order for dinner, the place had several open tables, and it only took them about 10 minutes to make our order."}
{"text":"Although the dumplings were good, that's all they have, and there are so many other interesting places in Chinatown that I would recommend going somewhere else instead.  The salad side dishes are good but small. I tried the celery and peanut salad and the cabbage, egg and carrot salad which I really liked. I just don't think it deserves 4 and a half stars."}
{"text":"Can't wait to visit their new and bigger location next door. I have only ever gotten take out form them because even at 4pm they were always packed. I've had most of their dumplings (fried, boiled or steamed) before and they are honestly one of the best places to get good quality dumplings.   Toronto...sadly doesn't have much monopoly here. Their prices are reasonable and you get pretty full off one order, but most importantly is that you can see them making your dumplings fresh right in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the yelp reviews.  Seems like Mai Xiang Yuan and Qing Hua are the two places in town people like to go for dumplings so had to try both (will post Qing Hua review later).    We tried the pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings and the beef curry dumplings.  I have to say I was surprised by the curry ones and really enjoyed them.  The pork ones were fine, good but I've had better.  A nice treat was the wasabi salad.  It had just enough vinegar and wasabi to give a tingle but not kill you.  The dumplings were fairly juicy, which is sort of interesting, you have to be careful how you bit them or you end up shooting juice/grease all over.  And with the curry ones you are asking for major trouble.  I'm more used one ones that are either true soup dumplings with a lot of broth inside of them or fairly dry ones or just enough juice to be good but not to squirt.  So this variation was an interesting experience (other dumplings I had in Montreal were similar).  I enjoyed them but you got to watch out!  The dough was a good thickness and had a nice \"tooth\" to it.    The odd things were they had no hot tea!  What is the world coming to when a Chinese restaurant that has so many kinds of dumplings doesn't serve hot tea!  One server was a bit frazzled with the limited number of people in the restaurant but we weren't in a hurry so that wasn't a big deal.  Good, reasonable priced dumplings with a surprise with the curry ones gets 4 stars even if they don't have tea."}
{"text":"So far the best Dumplings we ever had. and definitely would recommend this place to anyone who visits Montreal. The only thing that disappointed us was we had to wait 45 mins for a plate of fried dumplings."}
{"text":"This will be a short and simple review. Are the dumplings good? Yes, they are definitely really good. Are they the best ever? No, not at all. I wish I had gotten an order fried, as I bet that would have been better. Still, good dumplings. They're fairly cheap and the orders are really big. Their menu is almost entirely just dumplings (we also got a cucumber dish, which was pretty tasty) and it's cash only."}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings!  Stumbled across this place in the China Town district of Montreal.  Highly recommend if you are looking for outstanding dumplings.  Nothing else to this place...no ambience, no alcohol, no other food worth tasting....but wow, their dumplings (of all kinds) were spectacular.    Service was very good.    Best were the shrimp, egg and leek steamed dumplings...but also strongly suggest the lamb and the beef.  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"My wife and I hit this place everything we are in Montreal now and it always treats us well.  We arrived mid-afternoon so the place was not that busy, for those whose reviews complain about the \"time\" it takes to get the meal, you obviously aren't watching through the glass window as they make EACH order as it's ordered.  I watched the 4 ladies in the back make the dumplings that went into our soup (great on a -11 day) and shortly thereafter make the two sets of dumplings that we had fried.  Our favorite is the beef and coriander, yum!   Food comes out fresh and hot and incredible.    This is not a fancy place but who cares when the food is so good.  And it's cheap.    Only real complaints are that the tables are small so hard to hold the tea pot, soup, and dumplings on one table.  Also, for those travelers using AMEX, no go here.  Oh yea, and a few more napkins at each table could help, we had 1 to split :-)"}
{"text":"There are a lot of places that make dumplings but this place might be the reigning champ in Montreal. Never before had I bitten into a dumpling and had my eyes open so wide from delight. Every bite had so much flavor that my friends and I had to keep ordering.   In all, we ate the beef and curry onion, lamb and onion, pork and mushroom, and finally the beef with coriander and shrimp. The meats were well seasoned and very fresh tasting.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a perfect meal the morning after a night on the town."}
{"text":"Seriously great dumplings! Way better food than all the over rated \"French bistros\" here in Montreal. I think it was one of our best meal while here for 4 days!"}
{"text":"Holy. Crap.  The place is very much a 'hole in the wall'. It seats maybe 30 people.  I'm not going to bother describing the food.  What I will describe are the impressions of the people I've brought here.  My girl friend looks forward to a trip to Montreal, so she can eat as many of her lunches as possible here.  My coworkers, having eating here on my suggestion, mention it to me during the year, and how they were looking forward to going back to 'that dumpling place'.  You should be careful eating here. It could very well change your standards."}
{"text":"This place is way over rated. The fried dumplings with pork chives and shrimp was not tasty at all. Customer service sucks big time. I don't understand the hype about this. Perhaps the people who rate have not been to good dumpling places before. We recently came back from shanghai and the dumplings there are much better than this crap. The waitress server also discriminates toward chinese people. They only favor other tourists."}
{"text":"Boiled dumplings. Lamb and onion- delicious!  Fried dumplings- pork and Chinese cabbage-also delicious. Only not the most spotless restaurant. Kind of dingy. But if you can see past that, you will definitely enjoy these fresh handmade dumplings."}
{"text":"After visiting MTL a few times this has become a must stop on the list of places to eat. Mai Xiang was recommended to me by locals and it does not disappoint!   It's a small spot that tends to be packed for dinnertime. The dumplings are made in house and each order comes with a decent serving (I'd estimate 15-20 dumplings). Definitely enough for me to eat and have a leftover to snack on later. Authentic Chinese dumplings! My favorite is the pork and mushroom with a side of the cucumber jellyfish.   It seems like somewhat of a family operation so staff is minimal but they get you your food ASAP and you go up to the back counter to pay when you're done.   CASH ONLY! I always forget but they have an ATM at the front door if you're like me."}
{"text":"Eh. I've had better dumplings. The breakdown:  The good: The boiled lamb and onion dumplings we ordered had pretty good flavor and the filling was juicy and moist. Each order comes with 15 dumplings and was quite a filling meal. Prices are some of the lowest I've seen for a dumpling house.   The eh:  I don't recommend the fried dumplings at all. Ours came out charred and the filling was dry as a board. The flavor was hugely masked by the dough wrapper and (I can't believe I'm about to say  this) they didn't use enough oil to fry the potstickers. As a result, the wrapper of the dumpling was suuuuper dry and tough. No bueno.   My take away is that the dumplings are probably better boiled here. The moisture of the filling remains locked in the dumpling and you don't feel like you're hacking your teeth away like we did with the pan fried ones."}
{"text":"After having some amazing dumplings in Toronto, we wanted to find some more here in Montreal while visiting Canada.  Once again, Yelp did not disappoint.  I would like to point out that the I never saw Mai Xaing Yuan on the front of the building, and even the address and phone number were one off, but that said, the photos were the same and the menu identifies the place as Mai Xiang Yuan.  We were there at lunchtime and it was a clear favorite of some locals.  I would agree with one of the other reviews that said the dumpling with pork shrimp and coriander was a must.  We also got the soup with beef dumplings but found that a little bland.  The beef and onion were really good as well.  While I am normally a fan of them fried, we actually liked the steamed/boiled ones better.  Cash only which is not really a surprise in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place was closed for renos when i tried to go there on Jan 19, but luckily there was an amazing pho restaurant at 1082 Rue St Laurent that was a great stand-in"}
{"text":"I've eaten many a dumplings in my lifetime. This place has the best dumplings out of all chinatowns in North America...get the shrimp, pork, and coriander!"}
{"text":"Mai Xiang Yuan is without a doubt the best dumpling joint in Chinatown. In fact, sadly, I'm not so sure that any other Chinese restaurants period match up with it. If it was located in a city that had an abundance of good Chinese food it might be considered more average, but considering the sad state of Chinese food in Montréal, this will have to do.  I came in with a huge dumpling craving, so I ordered two plates - one of pork, leek, shrimp, and egg dumplings (boiled) and another one of beef and curry onion dumplings (fried). While the pork dumplings (a standard in my household) aren't as good as the ones that my parents make (but then again, every Chinese kid thinks their parents make the best dumplings), they were still tasty, juicy, and freshly made. They also used quality ingredients and whole pieces of shrimp are visible in every dumpling. The beef and curry onion dumplings were nicely fried on the bottoms and were a crisp alternative to their boiled counterparts, and the curry onion provided a nice flavoring to the beef, and they complemented each other very well. By the way, they also serve free tea here, just like I'm used to back home, in these cute teapots with their logo on it!   I come here every once in a while when I feel like walking down the hill, but every time is so worth it. If you ever need to satisfy yourself with warm food or don't have family around to celebrate Chinese New Year with, this place makes suitable dumplings that are guaranteed to fill you up and sooth your soul."}
{"text":"What's a visit to Chinatown without eating in a dumpling shop?! Easy on the wallet and so juicy on the inside. As a starter, I ordered the cucumber and jellyfish salad to whet our appetites. Then we ordered the shrimp/pork/leek and beef/coriander combos. They were SO good. Two orders were definitely very generous and we had to take the rest to go. You can order the dumplings steamed or fried. We went for fried and it wasn't even greasy. Made fresh (you can see into the kitchen) and no frills. Service is a little flakey, but who cares when the food is so good."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of dumplings and these are right up there with the best I've had. We went during the lunch rush and weren't given the option to sit, so we got take away.  I had the pork, coriander and shrimp while my wife had the shrimp, leek and egg. Both were succulent and tasted fresh, reasonably priced too. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a dumpling fanatic and I love the dumpling craze that's happening in Montreal's Chinatown.  Each restaurant has a different style so I decided to go dumpling hopping and try them all.  Here I tried the Curry Beef and Onion Fried Dumplings and the Shirmp, Pork and Coriander soup dumplings.    Two things to note if you're an American 1) Coriander= Cilantro.  Not the dried coriander seeds but the actual Chinese Parsley green leafy veggie.   2) Soup dumpling just means boiled dumplings most of the time.  Except at Qing Hau.  Curry Beef is good!  It has such a good kick to it that I really didn't need to dip it in any sauce.    Shirmp, Pork and Coriander Soup Dumplings were the fan fave-- makes me think why I don't put more Coriander/Cilantro in my cooking."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Spiders and bugs all over the place. Cutlery/plates were all wet and there was also water dripping from the ceiling. Not at all hygienic and the (vegetarian) dumplings were extremely average. Just one hot sauce and there was nothing hot about it. The soya sauce had a funny smell to it too. It's cash only which is usually an inconvenience I'm willing to overlook if the service/food/ambiance make up for it. In this case, it certainly didn't. Safe to say I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Simple. Delicious. Authentic.  Nice staff.  If you want 20 different kinds of dumplings fried or boiled go here.  Looked full of locals."}
{"text":"Possibly the best dumpings in Canada. Not only was it good, it cost almost next to nothing. Their popular and main dish is the pork dumping with cabbage (actually boy choi) for under $6 for 15 pieces.  I have to pay more than 2-3 times for such dumpings in Hong Kong and may not even get such good taste. Well worth a trip there!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and decided to check out Chinatown for lunch.  I was looking for a noodle soup place but was surprised at the number of dumplings only restaurants in Montreal.  I selected Mai Xiang because it had quite a few customers (in particular, Asian) which are positive signals.  I ordered the pork and mushroom dumplings.  It was quite tasty.  Total of 15 dumplings."}
{"text":"Pork and mushroom: 5 stars! This was amazing! Tasty and perfectly made. We got this entree steam and I really think maybe they do their steam dumpling better than their fried dumplings. If you like pork and mushroom, I would recommend this!   Beef curry dumpling: 3.5 stars. I ordered these fried and they come out like potstickers. It was a bit herby but overall, still good. However, we came near closing time and I feel because of that, they were in a rush. A couple of our dumplings came out undercooked.   Cucumber salad: 3.5 stars. A good cold dish compliment to our meal. Seasoned well and garnished with cilantro, carrots, and jalepenos.   No soup dumplings at the time we were ordering. I read in the comments and this seems to happen from time to time. I was a bit disappointed as we walked a long way to eat here.   Overall, solid dumpling house!"}
{"text":"Really wonderful Chinese dumplings, which you can get steamed, pan fried, or in soup. I especially liked the pork with pickled cabbage dumplings steamed. With a little bit of Chinese vinegar and hot sauce, they were divine. We also tried a couple of the little salad-like side dishes, one with jelly fish and the other with eggs. Both were unlike anything we've had in a Chinese restaurant before, but they were tasty and done well. Be aware that this is a cash only establishment. No credit cards."}
{"text":"Things to know before your visit: 1) the place is small and constantly full 2) they will bend over backwards to seat you 3) the food will not arrive quickly, but you can watch them make every dumpling by hand. 4) MOST IMPORTANT it is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The egg leak dumplings were okay but not as special as other reviews suggest otherwise.   Also, I think my tummy became achy because of the fungus salad (but can't say for sure).  Don't think I'll be back but gave them two stars because dumplings were freshly made."}
{"text":"I only had their Xia Long Bai and it's really good. The restaurant is mysteriously empty all the time. Check it out. You like their food.   One thing you get here and nowhere else; \"Lamp Soup\" on their menu"}
{"text":"Located in Chinatown, Mai Xiang Yuan is a no nonsense - no frills dumpling establishment. They do one thing and one thing only..... Dumplings. And there are just two ways they make it. My way (Fried) or the Boiled way. Tried their fried lamb & coriander dumpling. The dumplings are tasty and the chilli oil adds to the flavor. My only complaint was that the dumpling dough wasn't consistently thick all over hence makin it a bit unevenly cooked. FYI I'm not complaining about the meat. The meat is delicious and perfectly cooked. Its just the outer dough. Maybe its just me being too picky for Chinatown. The prices are very reasonable and they do accept cards.    Food -  Good Service - Fast  Ambiance - Clean lookin hole in the wall Worth the money - Yes"}
{"text":"Really helpful service, they even gave us other restaurant recommendations during our stay in Montreal. The food was fast, fresh, affordable and full of flavour.  Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I've been a good client of this place but today I found a piece of sharp glass nestled inside the filling of one of the dumplings. It's unacceptable to let the quality deteriorate due to their popularity. Someone (me) could have been seriously injured."}
{"text":"Pork and Leek!  Would like to return with a group so I can try more things."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings. This is a tiny place, but the food they serve is really, really good. I didn't like their appetizers that much, but their dumplings are great. There wasn't much about this place that I didn't like."}
{"text":"I love, love LOVE this restaurant. My favourite dumplings place in the city. Juicy, flavourful and super affordable. A must for anyone visiting Montreal or for locals who want a good, cheap meal."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 plates of pan fried dumplings, one with pork and chives, and the other with cabbages and dried shrimps.  Overall, the dumplings were stuffed well, and not too greasy.  The wrappers were about right, not too thick.  One plate is plenty for one person."}
{"text":"Located in a not-too-noticeable area of Chinatown.  Heard of this restaurant thru YELP reviews as well.  Overall, the experience was Ok.  The decor is regular, but the seatings were really cramped.  It wasn't too crowded of a place.  Small mom-and-pop shop vibe.  The service was Ok, but the waitresses were kind of slow with the bill.  I had to get up and pay the bill at the counter, when I believe they should've come to my table to get the bill from me.    The food was fine.  My friend got a congee of some sort.  We shared a plate of fried dumplings (which is the go to plate for this restaurant).  The dumplings were good, so the food does make up for the cramped environment and the somewhat slow service.  Overall, it was OK.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Very very bad experience, I ordered veggie steamed dumplings, but they were steamed from frozen stock, not freshly wrapped, and the dumpling dough was so thick and hard to digest. I also bought two bags of frozen dumplings for take out, the frozen veggie dumplings fell apart during cooking......the dough cracked and the fillings fell apart....so disgusting."}
{"text":"Really bad experience, they serve steamed frozen dumplings and the dumpling skin was too thick to digest. And the veggie frozen dumplings fell apart during cooking."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a gem like Restaurant Mai Xiang Yuan. Halfway around the world and thousands of miles from China, this indistinct dumpling shop situated just inside Chinatown along Saint-Laurent makes some of the best dumplings you will ever find. Even among the dozens of dumpling shops I frequented over the years in China, few can compare. They know their dumplings here, and with a dozen small tables and a growing reputation queuing for a table is becoming commonplace.   Hot tea and menus arrive as the skilled waitress juggles bussing tables, serving food and manning the cash register. Order placed, I wait and watch as the kitchen staff stuff fresh dumplings, racing to fill my order.  The pork dumplings with cilantro and shrimp are out of this world. Each one is packed with juicy ground pork that's been mixed with cilantro and molded around a large shrimp. The pork dumplings with cabbage are classic and the beef dumplings with shiitake mushrooms are another favorite.   Fifteen steaming dumplings are placed in front of me.  Before I dig in, I fill a small bowl with vinegar and pepper oil. The skins are a little sticky where dry and a little slippery where wet. Grabbing them with chopsticks can challenge even an expert, but I've learned that when all else fails, stab them. After a quick dip in the vinegar, I'm conflicted, two bites are required but I'd rather not wear my dinner. I'm hungry and not proud so I devour the entire delicious package. I repeat the procedure fourteen more times before I sit back in a glutinous haze and sip a fresh cup of tea.  I'll be back for more. In fact I think I'll get an order of raw dumplings to go and cook them at home."}
{"text":"I was gravely disappointed with not only the service, but the quality of the dumplings we ordered.  We waited about 40 minutes after we ordered our food for one of our orders of the dumplings to be brought to our table.  We had no plates or spoons other than the plate that the dumplings came in.  Our other order came after my daughter finished her order.  Then I noticed that the dumplings were not the ones I ordered!  The server quickly took the dumplings away after I had one out of the steamer and served them to the people at another table.  He then told me to wait a little bit for the correct order to come.   We waited another 20 minutes before my order came.  I ordered shrimp, leek, and egg dumplings.  I could only taste the \"bad\" scrambled eggs inside the wrappings.  I think that I had a total of 1/2 of a shrimp chopped up and spread across the 15 small dumplings in my order.  The dumplings were served directly on the bamboo steamers and I was not given a plate or utensils.  I found it very difficult to have my meal.  I ended up stuffing the bad and tasteless dumplings down my throat and finished the meal quickly so that I could leave.  The total time spent at the restaurant was about 2 hours.  It was definitely not worth our time and I will not rely on Yelp reviews in the future.  This is the fourth bad restaurant that Yelp reviews have guided me to."}
{"text":"I love it when Yelp comes through for the weary business traveler. It requires a little bit more effort (no data except wi-fi when hopping over the border) but when you find a place like this, you don't mind the limitations.  Mai Xiang Yuan is a small, reasonably-priced place with a small menu and a competent staff.  Complimentary hot tea gets you started while you look over the relatively short menu, which consists almost entirely of different types of dumplings. 15 of them per order, steamed or fried.  (Hint: Steamed.)  The dumplings are expertly prepared, combining the ingredients with just the right amount of broth (i.e., you can taste the broth inside but it's not full to the point of exploding all over your shirt and/or pants, an experience I'm not interested in repeating).  I've had dumplings elsewhere in Montréal, and I have to say that these are the best I've tried.  The lamb & coriander was delicious, but my favorite was the beef & mushroom.  The do-it-yourself dipping sauce was fun to play around with. Don't be afraid of the spice jar, and don't be afraid to hit the soy sauce hard -- it's definitely not even close to full strength. At first I was put off by the idea of soy sauce that's watered down, but I imagine it's necessary to make the dipping sauce work without giving you a lethal dose of sodium.  As I write this, I'm getting the craving. All of these reviews recommending dumplings I haven't yet tried... and what do I do when it's time to head home?"}
{"text":"No frills decor, service is minimalist, very consistent with most Chinatown restaurants across major cities. It is located in the heart of Montreal Chinatown so a good for some photo ops. Overall the taste is just fair. I like they have so many filling options, vegetarian, beef, lamb or pork. I agree with some of the reviewers that steamed actually taste much better than fried. The fried ones are so dry, takes away from the taste completely. Nothing too special, not worth making a special trip for.  But if you do, Cash Only"}
{"text":"Went here due to the many yelp reviews and was not disappointed! I highly recommend the shrimp, pork, and coriander dumplings steamed, they were the best dumplings I have ever had, EVER!  The fried beef curry dumplings were also very tasty.  I did not expect such delicious dumplings from such a small restaurant"}
{"text":"Première fois ici,c'était délicieux.  J'ai pris les dumpling frits boeuf et coriandre ainsi que dumpling vapeurs porc, crevettes et coriandre.  C'est 15 par assiette.  Le thé vert genmaicha est savoureux et réconfortant en cette journée froide d'automne !"}
{"text":"A cute lil place of dumpling heaven!!!  Drinks : Sapporo, Tsing Tao and soft drinks  Appetizers: We tried 3 different salads and they were all so unique with great flavor. Cucumber, leek with peanuts, carrot and cabbage with egg.  Food : They have an amazing selection of dumplings. 15 dumplings per plate and you can ask for half & half. We tried steamed lamb dumplings, pork with shrimp dumplings and beef curry dumplings. The beef curry was awesome and my personal favorite. The soy sauce mixed with the chilli oil is a great accompaniment for the dumplings.  Service : Fast and friendly.  Ambience : Not a fancy restaurant. A tiny hole in the wall.  Pricing : CAD 6.99 to 9.99 for a portion. That's pretty reasonable. Cash only restaurant .  Will I return? : A definite yes. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A true gem, comparable to the best dumplings I have had in a restaurant. It is a tiny place, easy to walk by and miss. Each order comes with 15 luscious dumplings. The somewhat translucent, elastic wrappers were not too thick or too thin, yielding perfect mouthfuls with distinctly flavored fillings. There were both traditional dumpling flavors, such as pork/cabbage, pork/leek, and some unusual filling combinations for $7-10.  The pork/mushroom and shrimp/leek/egg mushrooms are probably equally good boiled or fried into pot-stickers (add $1.50).  In addition, we quite enjoyed the beef/curry/onion dumplings, which the very nice waiter recommended to be fried.   There were vinegar, chili oil and soy sauce on the tables, so you did not have to ask for them. We also had a delicious jellyfish and cucumber salad, dressed with vinegar and probably sesame oil.  Although the waiter tried to tell us we were ordering too much for 2 people, we ate all but about 6 of the 45 dumplings.   I will add that the leftover steamed dumplings were perfectly delicious straight out of my hotel refrigerator the next morning for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pork/shrimp dumplings in North America region I ever I had!! Fresh made and juicy."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to stumble upon this place while trying to find a lunch place in Chinatown. Good thing my mom had a craving for dumplings. This restaurant serves dumplings and also hand-pulled noodles, but today they were all out of the noodles, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. We ordered three plates of steamed dumplings, but when my mom saw another table eating pan-fried potstickers, we added a fourth order. At first, I thought the dumplings weren't worth $9 since we got very similar dumplings in NYC for 20 cents each. But, each plate had 12-15 dumplings and they had a lot more choices in what they were stuffed with. My favorite was the beef curry steamed dumpling. The pan-fried cilantro beef potstickers were also amazing. We also tried the shrimp and beef steamed dumplings and the regular pork dumplings. I am a big fan of chili oil and they seem to have a house-made one ready at your table. Add some red vinegar to that and it is the perfect dipping sauce for your dumplings.   The cool thing about this place is that the dumplings are made fresh and ready to order. They don't start stuffing or wrapping them until they are ordered. You can see through the kitchen window how they stuff and fold them too! The service is great and the guy who took our orders could speak five different languages, which is pretty accommodating to all the different tourists they get. Back in San Diego, I loved this tiny little restaurant called the Dumpling Inn. This place is definitely better and should be aptly crowned the Dumpling Hotel Resort and Spa."}
{"text":"Food is good, place looks nice and really clean ! But the service .. Soo bad. I went on a sunday afternoon to take out . I took 2 orders (30 dumplings) and they gave me 2 small cups of sauce. I asked for more as we were four people eating . The cashier told me 'its enough' i thought it was rude and the whole time i was waiting, I felt as if i was really bothering her .."}
{"text":"After visiting the Faberge exhibit at the Mtl. Museum of Fine Arts, I wanted a quick bite to eat before heading home.  Had researched some local spots not far and Mai Xiang Yuan came up with good reviews, so I headed in that direction.  When I entered around 2 p.m. there were only two other diners there;  I was offered a table for two.  The hostess/server was not overly welcoming or friendly, but she did offer a menu and brought me a pot of nice hot tea.  I really only wanted a dumpling appetizer size portion but was informed they did not do 1/2 orders - so I requested the Lamb and Coriander dumplings (steamed).  There were 15 plump and delicious dumplings and I did manage to eat them all.  The plating of the food was very plain - no parsley or colour to enhance the plate and the sauces on the table were only soya and some spicy hot watery sauce.  This is just a small hole in the wall place, but tiny details can make a big difference in the enjoyment of a meal.   The décor is pretty tacky too; hanging red cut work Chinese lanterns from the ceiling and an annoying flat screen TV  with an Asian channel with people talking and eating.  The washroom was pretty dirty too:  dusty heat register, dirty waste bin and dirty floor - however the sink and toilet appeared to be fairly clean.  If the owners paid a little more attention to the cleanliness of the washroom, turn off the TV and play some nice Asian music, ask the hostess to smile and welcome guests and maybe add a smidgen of parsley to the plate and some plum-like sauce to dip the dumplings in - then I might return to give it another try."}
{"text":"Très bon test de raviolis asiatiques! Nous avons essayé des bouillis et des fris. Les deux sortes étaient très bons.  Il y a de nombreux choix de garnitures sympathiques carnivores ou non. Des salades et des soupes sont aussi à la carte et il est possible de commander à emporter."}
{"text":"Delicious hand made dumpling at affordable price. Get pretty busy on weekend lunch time.  Ordered both steamed & fried dumpling, my favorite is curry flavor steak pork dumpling.   No noodles are served so you will just order a plate of dumping with some side salad dishes.    Family of four ( 2 teen boys)  may need to each order one dish, you will be surprised how fast the delicious dumplings literally disappears from the plate.   Cash only."}
{"text":"There's nothing like walking into a joint that you're, at first, frightened to dine in.  This place isn't carpeted but it feels carpeted, ya know!  The rule is, maybe you shouldn't look in the corner of the floor or look behind the counter but one thing you should definitely fucking do is eat here.  The dumplings: homemade.  Your wallet: still fat. Your belly: now fatter.  You: Straight-up content with a glistening, dumpling-grease smile.    This is the real, delicately-folded dumpling dough of goodness, my friends.  I haven't done much right in my life but by this review and spreading the love that is this place, hopefully rights my wrongs.    Try this perfection.    RATING: 2 painfully erect nipples.  OUCH!"}
{"text":"Was cheap and really good. Salads are a bit barebones but only a buck. And the dumplings are very flavorful. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Hello. Do you want to eat Curry Beef Dumplings from a masterful Chinese chef?  If you said no, you are;  A. batshit crazy B. regular crazy C. a vegetarian (which covers both A and B... jokes)  All kidding aside this you will love this place. It's a cozy little family restaurant with gigantic tastes. The food is inventive yet comfortable, gourmet yet kindly priced, and served with love.  For dumplings, I'd bet anything you can't beat this spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"The service was very slow , our second plate arrived when the first one was totally finished, but anyway we shared our dishes and we ate hot food  The taste was  good , Not so many choices, just dumplings."}
{"text":"Cucumber salad was good and refreshing.  Had 3 orders of dumpling.  May not be the best place for young kids unless they love dumpling."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings at great prices! I come here at least once every time I visit Montreal and they've never disappointed. There's something fantastic about a dumpling that's not only packed with amazing freshness, but with little bit of soup/gravy that spills into your mouth your first bite.   They do seem to emphasize pork dumplings, but also have beef and lamb. I don't think they have a chicken option. So be aware if you have dietary restrictions.   The pork dumpings are pretty darn good though. I have to say I liked the steamed dumplings better than the fried ones. But I think it's hard to go wrong either way. Pick what you're in the mood for. This isn't a place that really has a best or signature type of dumplings.   Also be sure to bring cash! Someday they'll hopefully start accepting credit, but until then, picking up some cash beforehand is worth it.  Mix with spicy oil, vinegar, and soy sauce for an awesome dip!"}
{"text":"These are the best dumplings you will ever have. Unless you were a really good boy/girl and they serve dumplings in heaven. Those ought be pretty tasty too. But THESE dumplings you can have NOW. Don't wait, RUN do not walk here. Get the beef coriander to start, and they're my favorites.   They make the dumplings by hand behind a Window in the kitchen. It's a very cool atmosphere and always busy."}
{"text":"It's barely there and it's a hole in the wall but Montrealers swear by its dumplings. We got the shrimp, egg and leek and pork and picked Chinese cabbage dumplings. They were good, but nothing spectacular. Service was fine, just overall I wasn't blown away like many of the reviewers on here, who I would encourage to check out Mother's Dumplings if they're ever in Toronto - THAT is a truly mind-blowing dumpling experience."}
{"text":"Almost 4 years later and I stopped back. When I got here the storefront was all papered up. I wad yelping to see where else in the neighbourhood I could go and a girl came out on the sidewalk and told me they had moved next door to a slightly larger but much less cramped space. Still no white rice. And this time, no tea either (sad face) So ONLY dumplings. This time I had pork and leek (7.99) and they were as tasty as I remembered, and still 15"}
{"text":"I m usually too lazy to give reviews on yelp. But this place is absolutely amazing. The dumplings are authentic and really reminded me of home. This place made my day!"}
{"text":"Watch through a window in the back of this tiny place as your dumplings get gently folded up and cooked fresh by women with serious, food loving faces. Enjoy the pop of juices, the perfect cooking, the lovely balance of flavours. Based on Yelp reviews last night we tried the beef curried dumplings fried, the pork, shrimp and coriander fried, and the pork and oyster steamed. 15 dumplings are served per order. Dinner was $35, served with speed and a smile by the one tasmanian devil of a waiter holding the whole place down and banging out some serious rapid fire turnover without making you feel rushed. We boxed up massive leftovers and left glowing."}
{"text":"Smaller place with brick interior. Easy to find actually within the heart of Chinatown. Good interior. Crowded for lunchtime. Dumplings were superb, both fried and boiled."}
{"text":"I came to this place, based on the recommendations of yelpers, and found it lacking. I was all ready to get my dumpling on, and was kind of disappointed.  The fried dumplings were very greasy. They were juicy, but too greasy.  As for the service, which is why I am even taking the time to write this, was not attentive at all. When asked for water, the hostess just nodded and ignored the request.   There was no napkins provided, and in fact I saw a mother have to stand up and get some from another table, which is a boo moment, in my book.  Since I did not get any water or napkins, I stood up and got them myself, another boo moment.   I think they need to understand that all their customers are potential critics, and treat them that way. At least put napkins on all the tables!!"}
{"text":"The place for good chinese dumpling. I usually like the dumplings pan fried for some extra crispy flavour.  WAYYYY better than Qing Hua! And this place is truly authentic, come here or even just for take-out, for good dumplings. I give four stars because only our family-made dumplings can be five stars, lol."}
{"text":"I can't even pronounce the name correctly, but they make the best dumplings in Montreal (or universe, probably). We tried several of them, and all were great. My favourite was the one with curry. I am not very sure about the fried ones though... Just stick with the classic boiled ones. I also loved the experience of watching the cooks - jampacked in that tiny kitchen - rolling the dumplings with their hands. Overall, great experience..."}
{"text":"Among the other restaurants in Montreal's Chinatown, I like this place the best. Why? Their pork/shrimp/leek and egg dumplings, that's why!   You can choose to either steam them or fry them (it's a few extra cents to fry them).   With 15 dumplings on a plate, these dumplings are enough to fill you for a few hours until your next meal."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for my new, hole-in-the-wall comfort food go-to in la Belle Province. I LOVE dumplings, and this place does them well. Had a half dish of pork/coriander and lamb... both amazing.  Do NOT expect any sort of friendly service, however. This just isn't that type of joint. Doesn't matter, though, worth the food."}
{"text":"Over all we enjoyed this restaurant. It is cash only, but they had a pretty good selection of dumplings. We opted for the pork shrimp and cilantro dumplings. We were disappointed that they did not let us mix the dumplings as one order includes 15 dumplings. We would have liked to have tried a couple of different varieties. That being said we did very much enjoy the dumplings that we had. Casual place with quick no frills service."}
{"text":"Dumplings were subpar compared to Sammi's or Qing Hua. Flavourless and small for the amount that you are paying. Service was okay at first but every time someone wanted to order a particular item she would tell them that another type of dumpling or way to cook the dumplings were better. And when we went to pay to the bill she kept telling us that the amount does not include tip...several times. That said, we were a big group and so maybe she was worried that we assumed service charge was included. Although there are probably better ways of saying it. The waitress was really pushy about everything and so the dining experience was really not great. But it is a hole in the wall and it is a typical Chinese restaurant that offers bad service."}
{"text":"Great soup dumplings of many different types. Small restaurant with efficient service, but the focus is on the food, and it is quite inexpensive."}
{"text":"Très bon dumpling servi en grande quantité.  Par contre ne pas y aller pour Le service qui est particulièrement froid et voir inexistant.  Par contre, rapport qualité prix excellent!"}
{"text":"Was told by 2 friends of mine that this resto was a must try. I had no interest in trying this restaurant as I am not a big fan of just eating dumplings especially when you have to eat 15 of the same thing. After being told over and over I finally decided to give it a shot. After walking into this restaurant and being slightly disgusted with the ambience I was not expecting much at all.   I ordered the beef and mushroom dumplings and my life was changed forever. I was so pleasantly surprised with the beautiful flavour and freshness of these gifts from god. I can not go longer than a week without eating at this restaurant. The cucumber salad is a must order as well. I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"The location is small and not very welcoming, so Imd recommend, if like me you only like to linger in well-designed locations, that you order these awesome dumplings to go!  I went with a group of friends and we ordered I think 8 types of dumplings and shared, and to be honest, i couldn't taste a difference between most of them, beef, lamb, coriander, shrimp... It was all the same yummy flavour so... Yum in the end is what matters!"}
{"text":"They take cash only but there was an ATM in the front. Small litttle place located in Chinatown. The Dumplings come in orders of 15 and comes with the option of having it boiled or fried. Both options are good but I preferred the fried option for the extra crunch. Highly recommend the pork, shrimp and mushroom dumpling."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC handmade dumplings. I only ordered the steamed vegetarian ones, and they were to die for. I ate here two days in a row."}
{"text":"I had the pork, shrimp, and mushroom dumplings, steamed. I also tried the pork and cabbage, fried, and the mushroom, cabbage, and mung bean dumplings, steamed.   This is simple food, made well. Absolutely delicious.   You don't come here for the ambiance, but for the dumplings, which are superb."}
{"text":"The service and little window where the ladies make the dumplings are nice, but having access to great dumplings in SoCal, I found the food to be just okay.   If you don't have decent dumplings at home, I can see the appeal. But if you live in a city and are accustomed to (or maybe even a bit picky about) xiao long bao, Mai Xiang Yuan is just so-so."}
{"text":"This place is legit, probably the best dumplings I've had. If you're after anything besides dumplings, you should check out somewhere else because that's pretty much all this place serves.  Service was great, though multiple tables seated after me got their dumplings before me (I suspect because I ordered fried and they had steamed).  I had the fried beef and coriander dumplings which were very delicious, especially with the vinegar and chili paste on the table."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would.   These were the best dumplings I have ever eaten! The variety, taste, quality, freshness, all were outstanding!  A word about kids: I had a somewhat fussy 8-month-old and a very, very upset 2-year-old who was acting out horrendously and in her hyper flurry knocked over her water within the first 5 minutes. The server was so sweet and kind and understanding and brought her out a cut up fresh peach to snack on while we ordered and waited for our food. 180 degree different child.   The food was not super fast but was worth the wait! Each order of dumplings comes with 15, and for an extra $.50 you can split the order into 2 different flavors. For another $.50 they will fry them. My husband, daughter, and I split 2 orders, each divided into two flavors. I'll rank them in order of MY preference, but they were all 10/10. (My husband couldn't decide which he liked best and liked them all equally.)  1. Beef with curry onions  2. Pork with Chinese cabbage (my 2-year-old's favorite) 3. Beef with coriander 4. Pork with mushrooms  We only have 3 days here in Montreal and have already decided that we will be going back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty and fairly priced dumplings. We had the pork, shrimp, and coriander fried dumplings and they were delicious and crispy without being too greasy.   With that said, I'm docking one star because as I paid and grabbed my change, the waitress kept staring at me and said, pointedly, \"Doesn't include tip.\" First, I didn't think so and was going to leave you a tip on the table. Second, oh hi. Rude, much? It's not like I'm delusional and have come to expect brilliant service in Chinatown, but like, really?"}
{"text":"The dumplings were delicious!. Especially the cilantro pork and shrimp  ones.  Wasn't feeling the curry dumplings that we recommended. Opted for all steamed to be a little health conscious. The service is fast but that's about it.  They give you a pot of tea when you arrive which is nice. My husband and I enjoyed the relaxed international fast food atmosphere.  Great value for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"My god this place is delicious. I'm honestly surprised I'm giving a 5 star review for a place without alcohol, but the dumplings are just that good. For about $8 you get a platter of 15 dumplings. They have a variety, including pork, beef, etc. It's not vegetarian friendly, so keep that in mind.   Definitely get the pork & mushroom!"}
{"text":"Delicious Dumplings! We got the Pork-Soybean-Carrot and the Shrimp-Pork-Mushroom - boiled - and they were both delicious. The reason I gave this 4 stars is because each order comes with 15 dumplings so you don't get to try many flavors unless you have a large party. I wish they offered a sampler. Perfect dinner after visiting Old Montreal and just a short walk from there to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Had the Peanut and Celery Salad 3.5/5 and the Lamb and Onion fried dumplings 5/5. Nice spot. Great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We could not of been luckier, walked up at 6pm Sunday night and the front table for three was wide open. Random water put on the table and an old, wore out menu... No bother.... Not why we came here. Ordered up a lamb leak and beef coriander set of dumplings. The ladies hand made them in the back while we waited.....wow. Next stop, juicy pillows of loveliness dipped into authentic  vinegar soy sauce (yes, the vinegar bite you get in China). Outstanding love of chewy, puffy, sour dumplings.   Only reason it is not 5stars is that i always hold that for the one in the million.  Do it. Just eat it. Go ahead....eat it....no ones watching!"}
{"text":"Dumplings were good, but service wasn't so good. Cheap, but ultimately not worth the hour long wait sitting at the table waiting for our food. We went on a Tuesday night, so I can't imagine how bad it is on a busy restaurant night. Would definitely go again if I knew the wait time would be shorter."}
{"text":"US Californian review here!  Now I am lucky to be from the Bay Area with so many places for dumplings.   This place.... all they sell is dumplings! Be mindful, they also call them raviolis here. Crazy right? Every order comes with 15 and you get to choose steam or fried.   My wife and I shared one order of the steam pork, shrimp, and cilantro dumplings. They were pretty darn good. I was instantly happy after the first bite.   If you're around, do yourself a favor and just try these. One of the best dumplings I have tasted.   Quick tip: Pay at the register in the back when you're done."}
{"text":"C'était super! Mais ça a fermé.  C'est simple et super bon!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, hot and fresh. There were so many choices on the menu I ended up asking which dumplings from the pork section to get and the waitress gave me three options, which were all of the ones I was between... so I ordered the cucumber and jellyfish salad and the pork and leek dumplings (steamed). I was not disappointed. The only \"wish\" I have for this place is to have smaller portions so you can sample more of the menu, each order of dumplings has 15 pieces, soup has 10 pieces.  I can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town to start working my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Montreal is known for many things when it comes to comfort food, but this is my go-to place. I was here three times in a ten day stretch recently, for both lunch and dinner.  All they do here is dumplings. And they sure know what they're doing.  Delicious, hand made, soft, and filling. They are served in 15-piece orders, so they're perfect for sharing. Opt for them steamed, or for an extra $1.50, you can have them pan fried. My favourites are the mushroom, followed by the coriander lamb and the curry beef.  The menu is a little confusing because they have removed several items, half-covered by little stickers."}
{"text":"The food is tasty but I was really pissed about the general experience. This place is trying to make the most money out of tourists like me. I ordered 3 different dumplings and a Sapporo. I ended up paying $49 without tip. Since it is cash only, I didn't think of asking for a receipt but now I realize I should have. Knowing that each dumpling costs about 8-9$, I don't know how they managed to charge us 49! Plus, the service was terrible, not a slight smile or any 'how is everything'. I can see they only care about running the business.   Plus, only cash means no tax. Only cash and no receipt. Great business. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"One of the best dumpling spots in Montreal! Try any of their steamed pork dumplings or fried beef dumplings and you won't go wrong. Very worth the price and portions are reasonable."}
{"text":"fantastic dumplings. got some type of steamed dumpling and i can't even remember the filling. i am sure they are all good. best to go with 4 people and split 3 orders of dumplings. 15 dumplings per order. i think it was like $8.50.   this place was packed. the weird thing was that it was 100% white people in the middle of chinatown.   up there with the best thing we ate on the trip."}
{"text":"$8 for 15 dumplings (your choice of steamed or fried). I'd preferred the steam. Much better texture and flavor.   Is this a \"must eat\" in Montreal? No. But if you're in ear china town, definitely go for it!"}
{"text":"Good dumplings. Take out maybe better. The most optimized staff system I've ever seen: The same guy does it all but cook and prepare the food. This place is by far one of the best dumpling places in Montréal."}
{"text":"We had dinner during our first night visiting Montreal. All the food was fantastic. The portions were ample but not over the top, and the dumplings were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I would have liked a little more variety on the menu, but I can understand the need to keep things concise in a small establishment."}
{"text":"The dumplings are so delicious! If you like dumplings this is definitely the restaurant you should go! I wish they could have congee/soup and more hot plates choices besides dumplings and side dishes."}
{"text":"This place rules. It's been on my bookmark list for ages and it did not disappoint. We dragged our Halloween hangovers here at about 4pm, the place was half filled. I don't understand what the comments are below suggesting this place is kind of dirty, we found it very normal really, perhaps a teeny bit better even than what you'd expect in chinatown.  It's all dumplings really, and some salad starters. We had lettuce with peanut sauce and celery with peanuts for starters. Super yummy. Then for mains, we ordered three types of dumplings: beef in soup (10), beef curry (15) and shrimp/egg (15). And they were just amazing. Service was great and on point. Vibe is nice a semi-quiet and chill. Food came at appropriate times. Tea was included. And the bill was $36 after tax.  Total score. Will definitely, definitely be returning here. We loved it."}
{"text":"Believe the hype; this place is flippin magic! The quality, taste and execution of the humble dumpling at this establishment is nothing less than 5 stars. They know what they're doing and the end result is a mind blowing dumpling that's good either steamed, fried, or in soup. Don't forget to squirt some vinegar to cut through the richness; that takes it to a whole other level.   At lunch the salads are $1, take advantage of that especially the cabbage/wasabi salad, or order all of them; for $1, what have you got to lose except find yet another addiction.   From the outside it doesn't look like much but if you are in fact a legitimate dumpling fan, passing this place up would be a huge mistake. My only dillema is that there is nothing close to something this well executed back home so until I'm able to return to Montreal all I can do is daydream."}
{"text":"I'm by no means a dumpling expert, not even knowledgeable really. Still the dumpling bar had been set fairly high: the only time I had had the dish before, a Chinese friend had made them in front of me, including the broth and filling. Needless to say: delicious!  I was pretty interested in trying their steamed dumplings, but had never seen them fried before. So we settled for pork and leek, one steamed plate and one fried. The fried plate doesn't deserve the heat it gets here: the menu does say \"pan-fried\", so yes, one side is crisp and the other is a regular, cooked dumpling. The dumplings almost burst with filling, which is very tasty and piping hot! We seemed to have come on a good night: our waitress was lovely and attentive. The seaweed salad was alright, but the portion was generous. Even though the prices are low, it's worth saying that one plate might be enough, even for me - and in any case I'm not sure they do doggy bags. As it's been mentioned elsewhere: cash only folks!"}
{"text":"Delicious Dumplings! I heard Montreal is known for dumpling spots, and this place was the most highly rated of the bunch. So I had to try it, and it didn't disappoint! The homemade wrappers was good, and the meat was interesting and flavorful. This is how dumplings are supposed to be eaten! Served with vinegar and chili oil. You also get a ton for not much money."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed the food here (one order boiled, one fried, and seaweed salad), but service was terrible. They forgot about our second order of dumplings not once but TWICE (and when it finally came out it was the wrong order but we didn't care enough to correct them by then), were terribly delinquent in refilling our waters, and when I went to pay at the end and started to count my change, our waitress rudely yelled \"tip is not included!!\" I shouldn't have even tipped her by that point but my common decency told me otherwise. Can't say I'd go back after all that hassle."}
{"text":"This place has the best dumplings I have ever had in my life. These are not soup dumplings (soup and meat inside the dumpling)...FYI! I was so surprised by how good they were bc I've had some fr NYC and these really top anything I've had.   Pork dumplings- they are seasoned so well and full of flavor. They don't skimp in the filling either.  Make sure to dip it in the vinegar and chili oil!   There is a man and woman that work in the back and you can watch them make your dumplings to order. The place is a local mom and pop establishment with one lady taking orders, giving drinks, and bringing the food out.   You can also buy dumplings frozen to boil them at home...I was almost willing to buy frozen dumplings for my parents but I doubt the dumplings would have made the flight home.   Def coming back to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings!  J'y suis allé un midi, où, je crois, les prix sont plus bas.  Service courtois, sans plus.  Mais pour 9$, on vous sert 15 excellents dumplings.  Nous avons essayé ceux au porc et cari, et ceux crevette, porc et coriandre.  Tout était absolument délicieux, et les portions sont généreuses.  Très recommandable!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for some yum dumplings in Montreal. I always order the cabbage and mushroom dumplings. My friends and husband really like the beef curry onion dumplings. Service is alright, not great. For example, they don't serve water if you don't ask for it. But the food makes up for the average service."}
{"text":"Pretty ghetto-looking restaurant. Staff was on and off their lunch break, so they were enjoying a big banquet in the back of the restaurant. Also, overheard a girl saying that she had the fried dumplings before and thought it was gross because it was oily... what does she think fried means?  I wanted to come here because of the more unique dumpling ingredient combos versus the norm of beef, pork, chicken. I knew I had to try the lamb dumplings. The meat was definitely very pungent like lamb is supposed to be, but there were little pieces of bones, so that was not too delightful. I would have liked to try more of the unique combos like beef curry, but my bf likes his staples so we got the shrimp, eggs, and leek dumplings. Of course, it was mostly leek and eggs.  Get an appetizer of the cold cucumber salad, and you'll have a nice meal for 2 for about $20."}
{"text":"Dumplings were delicious!!! I definitely recommend them boiled over fried, though. Pork, shrimp, and leek is my favorite. Their dumpling soups are not worth it. The soup base is very, very bland--like water.   Located in the heart of Chinatown so parking is a pinch. Inside is not too clean. Service is sub-par.  It would be better if they accepted card!! It's CASH only at this joint."}
{"text":"If you want dumplings, this is the place.  If not, dumplings are all they have.  This is CASH ONLY despite what Yelp lists.  It's in Chinatown where the restaurants are not all real clean.  This one falls in the middle."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place five stars because my taste buds were blown out if the water, but due to the hygiene issues, I just can't.   I read the reviews and was expecting a bit of a dive, and a peek into the kitchen cleanliness there seemed fine but the cursory wipe of the table and cabbage remnant on the chili bowl were a bit distressing. However I wasn't going to let this get between me and some stellar dumplings.   We tried both pure steamed lamb and chive and fried pork and cabbage. The lamb and chive dumplings were amazing, strong flavors and good size. These were rounder dumplings. I tend to poke them to allow the boiling water and steam to escape. I loved the pork dumplings as well but the fried style just didn't hit with me as much as the pure steamed.   Overall definitely go here. The dumplings are incredible, and the side salads are delicious. Just don't look at the rug."}
{"text":"Don't understand what the fuss is about... The dumplings were ok and the portions large, but it ain't worth 4 1/2 stars.  There isn't much variety and the dumplings were a bit too doughy.  Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Qing hua and get some soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Selon mes expériences ce sont mes dumplings préférés.j'en ai essayé plusieurs et je pourrais facilement recommander porc champignons ou boeuf et coriandre , porc choux chinois et la liste continue .esaayez dumplings vapeur avant d'essayer les frits. Le resto subit presentement des renos alors appeler avant. Bonne adresse dans le quartier"}
{"text":"Best dumplings in town. The place is cool, the prices are very cheap: 15 dumplings for a plat! It's the first place that I think if I want eat dumplings! The chicken dumplings are so tasty, but also the beef ones and the vegetarians! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Handmade Dumplings were out of this world! Vinegar with the juices were sensational. Especially enjoyed the staff and quiet atmosphere. Not your ordinary noodle house. Family style all the way"}
{"text":"This is the place for Dumplings , many choices, boiled or pan fried, full of flavour, made fresh , fast service even during lunch time and very affordable. Would definitely  recommend it."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and thank the dumpling Gods we came here. This place was amazing! Everything on the menu seemed appetizing and mouthwatering. Although they only serve dumplings - it is fresh and literally made in house and you can see the lovely ladies taking their time to make each dumpling. They had many different flavour combos that we didn't know which one to pick.   With all that being said, our table of four ordered  all steamed beef &  coriander, lamb & coriander, and (2) pork & leek dumplings. Each order came with 15 dumplings which was enough to fill everyone on the table. They also have soy & vinegar on the table to accompany the dumplings. We were all in heaven and by the time we were on the last few dumplings - we were going to order more!   Overall this place was one of the best dumpling places I have ever been to and was one of the highlights of my trip! Highly suggest this place for anyone who is craving dumplings!"}
{"text":"Mai is a great place in Chinatown in an unassuming spot with an unassuming frontage. The lettering on the top of the restaurant is faint and sort of hidden. Almost like they don't really want you to read that you have arrived at a great hand-made-to-order dumpling house. Having eaten here once. Just once. I don't want anyone else to know where it is. I want to save it for myself but here am I.   Our party of six got seated in a short while. It's good for groups. Six is a nice big size. Eight would be pushing it. You have your standard menu with dumplings broken out by main protein categories: pork, beef, lamb, and seafood. They also have dumplings in soup, not to be confused with soup dumplings. The former they have. The later they do not.   We ordered beef curry which was right on curry flavor and spicy such that the beef was not lost in it. We also ordered the pork and pickled Chinese cabbage, which was the table favorite, and some seafood one that was good but underwhelming. Half of our order was steamed and the other fried. You should know fried dumplings are a buck and fifty cents extra per order, which is worth it, although dumplings were good enough as it. I would eat it raw and uncooked if I had them. It didn't look like you could order anything wrong. So what you really like is going to be personal. I'm ready to go back and see what can beat beef & curry one for me.   Make sure to bring your A game with your chopsticks! The steam and water makes it a bit tricky eating it. And be careful of the water trapped from the steaming inside the dumplings. It is hot."}
{"text":"Awesome dumplings.  All that you need to know.  - D"}
{"text":"I had a wantan soup w pork & cabbage dumplings and my husband got fried beef & onion dumplings. They are fresh & delicious and great for the value (16 dumplings for less than $10 CAN!!!) I will order fried beef dumplings for myself next time :-)"}
{"text":"This is my second favorite dumpling place, it's not that the dumplings aren't as good as Qing Hua but I live closer to it so it gets extra points for proximity.   Mai Xiang Yuan has great dumpling, not to mention the variety. I guaranty that they'll have something for every one from plain Jane pork to my favorite Oyster and pickled cabbage. In my opinion the best way to enjoy this kind of restaurant is with a group of friends so you can each get a different type of dumplings and share them, but if you're on your own you can always get them to give you two kind of dumpling per basket.  There isn't much to say about the service other then it's like most places in Chinatown quick and efficient but without much conversation.  I memory serves me correctly they close early as well, so if you have a craving for dumpling past 9 pm you might be out of luck.  This is a small place with only a dozen or so tables and what feels like hundreds of waving cats. If you plan on heading over with a group it might be a good idea to call ahead and make a reservation. If you're in or around Chinatown you might want to stop in and enjoy some of the best dumplings in the city while being watched by waving cats."}
{"text":"I gotta say..I wasn't looking or expecting good dumpling when during my stay in Montreal.  I love the dumplings, I prefer the steamed from the pan fried.   Also order the pork and shrimp!  What else can I say, did I mention that it's a small place and typical china town that you always ask yourself a question: do I really want to eat here, it's kinda dirty and dingy..but you're glad that you ate at the place...This is that kinda place.  What's even better, you will see the cooks making your dumpling made to order in the back part of the restaurants."}
{"text":"25 for two people totally. 2 plates of dumplings. I like the price. The food is so good. I recommend coriander lamb, the mushroom and shrimp/pork. the place got bigger after they moved several months ago. No need to wait for eating. Better."}
{"text":"This place is dumplings, nothing but dumplings, but when you do it this good you don't need anything else.  I wasn't feeling that good the day we went here & didn't want to stray far from the hotel. This was just 2 blocks away so I decided to chance it.  Am I glad we did.  This is a fantastic find.  Was still crowded at 3 in the afternoon.  I had the beef & curry onion dumplings, fried.  My friend had one of the seafood selections.  Both were excellent.  We spiced them up with the sauces on the table - a nice touch to be able to make it as hot or mild as you want.  We took some soup to go for later as well.  Definitely a place to come back to.  I loved watching them make the dumplings right in front of us as well."}
{"text":"Okay sure, these dumplings are pretty freaking delicious. I just moved here from the states with my boyfriend. Recently my dad came to visit us and I know he loves dumplings so we stopped by. Wasn't too busy. Service was fair. Dumplings were REALLY good! Had a great selection, awesome.   Now for why two stars. My dad used his credit card and about a week later when he was back home, he finds his credit card number was stolen and had hundreds of dollars worth of purchases from an online shoe store. Really? I don't get people. We give you business and even tip really well, and that's how you treat your customers? Oh well, I guess if we want to go back we will have cash ready."}
{"text":"Best fried dumplings I found in the city. I like the curry beef and the coriander lamb! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Have to say that these were some of the best dumplings I've had in all my travels. Extremely well priced and you get 15 dumplings for each flavour you order. Pork, shrimp and coriander were definitely the pick. Service was quick and food tasted so fresh. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Je commence à connaitre les bons dumplings à Montréal. Ceux-ci sont définitivement excellents. Très bon service, menu simple avec les classiques. Pas vraiment d'options végétariennes. Les options végétariennes sur le menu ont des crevettes. RESPECT! C'est evidemment très peu dispendieux et très frais. La différence en Qing Hua qui est la compétion en terme de Dumpling fait à la main, minute, c'est 1: Menu simplifié, pas de buns mais la qualité des ingrédients est supérieures et le résultat superbe aussi. Qing Hua, c'est très bon, grosse quantité, trop de truc sur le menu ce qui fait qu'on perd un peu en qualité VS Mai Xiang Yuan.   J'ai pris - à deux - les dumplings a la vapeur au champignon et oignon et chevette , LEs champignon frais, très bon. Ensuite les dumplings au boeuf au currry et oignon frits et agneau et coriandre. En entrée la salade de méduse et concombre. La joie de ce repas est dans le fait que chaque dumping qui arrivait au fur et a mesure qu'on terminait l'assiette était meilleur que le précédent. Quoi de mieux qu'un repas qui est toujours meilleur au fur et a mesure que nous sommes servit, Sans aucun doute raisonable un des meilleurs repas à moins de 20$ par personne que je peux trouver à Montréal. Tout genre confondus. Et Oui! Burgers et Pizzas, Watch out, ces dumplings offre un moment de joie gustatives subtiles et déliquintescent."}
{"text":"We checked this place out on a Friday night as a group of about 8 people and were seated without an issue. The location is clean but not huge but we also did not feel like the tables were too stuck together which was nice. They have a nice selection of dumplings with the option to have them fried or steamed. The prices were sooooo cheap and the dumplings were delicious ! We had the lamb&Coriander (Steamed) and the (Shrimp/Pork) Fried, both were so tasty and really hit the spot. The reason this place didnt get 5 stars is because they were extremely slow with service and even though we specified we were not all sharing all the plates they only brought one plate of dumplings and then we had to wait quite a while for the rest to arrive, there were even people at other tables that were seated/ordered after that ended up getting their plates first.  All in all though , this was a good experience and I would definitely be back for more dumplings !  Helpful Tip - Cash only !!!! (They do have an ATM on site though)"}
{"text":"delicious dumplings for very cheap (most plates less than 10$ for 15 delicious dumplings) would recommend getting boiled, if not then get steamed drink the soup of the dumpling first then eat the rest, dip in soysauce mixed with vinegar for best taste service was alright, not outstanding but not disappointing either"}
{"text":"Wow, am I ever glad we found this place. Thanks to Yelp, we searched the neighbourhood for a good lunch spot after taking my son to the nearby Children's Hospital for some morning appointments. We had heard great things about their Chinatown location and were excited to try this resto's dumplings. We were the only customers there, and so it turned out to be a nice and quiet dining experience. We started off by ordering two types of dumplings, but after we finished our meal, we were convinced we NEEDED to bring two more plates of dumplings home to eat later for snack or dinner. Yes, they're that good. The pork and mushroom boiled dumplings were so full of flavour - the filling was very juicy and moist while the dumpling wrappers were soft and velvety. The fried beef curry dumplings were browned and crispy on the outside, and so savory on the inside. When we got home, we were equally taken with the boiled pork, shrimp, and coriander dumplings and the fried pork and cabbage dumplings. These dumplings are so fresh and tasty that you do not even need the accompanying dipping sauce. Four plates of 15 dumplings each came to $37 including tax. I would go back to this place in a heartbeat for a scrumptious and filling lunch."}
{"text":"How can one go wrong with dumplings?  Literally 10 steps from the entrance to ChinaTown, this cute little place served up delicious dumplings in your choice of fried or boiled. Coming from a traditional Chinese family who hand makes dumplings every month, this place was on the ball.   Highly suggest the fried Shrimp pork and cilantro dumplings. After taxes and tips was around $11 for 15 amazing morsels.   I'm docking them one star because it kinda took longer than i expected for our food to arrive, and the cashier lady was rather rude."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive dumplings and decent service. We did take out. This not haute cuisine, and I've had more amazing dumplings in Beijing ... but I've also had much worse in North America. I recommend the beef and cilantro and the vegetarian mushroom ones. The pork and cabbage ones were somewhat bland."}
{"text":"It need interior decorating for 5 star.  We order pork & cabbage dumpling and pan fried pork, shrimp & coriander dumpling....Very very good...coming from a chinese background."}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings, albeit the fried variety were a bit dry. Service was fast and efficient, but lacked any form of warmth. Dumpling offering was varied, but not much else (read: nothing) is available.  All in all, a good choice when in Chinatown for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This was the first dumpling restaurant I had ever been to. It was the best thing I had ever eaten, and for a month I could think of nothing else. After having tried different places I can say their dumplings are good. Most dumpling restaurants offer the same choices, but what makes this restaurant different is its cozy setting.   Great prices, service is okay, and the dumplings are good."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef and the pork dumplings IN soup. My bad that I thought they would be soup dumplings! Haha the soup's only flavor came from the seaweed, cilantro and green onions floating in it."}
{"text":"WARNING: You must tip the waiter, otherwise they will harass you.   THE FOOD ISN'T WORTH THE TRIP OR THE EMBARRASSMENT I WAS SUBJECTED TO.  This place only serves DUMPLINGS. Wish I had seen that info in the reviews. But I like dumplings so it I wasn't overly disappointed. The food was ok, nothing to travel for (which I did by yelp referrals).   I traveled from US and had not exchange to Canadian money yet, charged with credit card at end of meal and the guy demanded his tip right there. I declined because it was so rude and abrupt. The service is non existent. However I decided to leave a couple of US dollars on the table before leaving anyhow, after I'd clean and stacked dishes for them leaving them nothing to clear off.   But as I was walking to go the waiter demanded I leave at least 10% tip. Wouldn't let me go. I said I have no more cash. He didn't want to hear it insisting I give tip. I would have revised the CC amount to have him release me, but I had to run another CC transaction for the tip he demanded.   I was so mortified at the spectacle that I did it just to leave. In hindsight I shouldn't have left anything and just walked out."}
{"text":"I come here often and I always eat the same thing. Lamb/coriander. It's simple, fresh. super tasty and inexpensive dumpling and satisfying. Unfortunately it's closed on Mondays.  Their dumplings are a bit on the thick side but when I want thin ones I go to another place I like also 2 doors down."}
{"text":"Dropped by this restaurant on a freezing Sunday night and left very satisfied. First of all this restaurant only serves dumplings as a main dish. You can order it either boiled or fried (for an extra $1).   My group ordered the Pork & Leek Dumplings, Lamb & Celery Dumplings, Pork, Leek, Egg and Shrimp Dumplings all boiled, and the Pork and Pickled Cabbage dumplings fried. All the dumplings were delicious! My personal favorites were the pork and leek, and lamb and celery dumplings. The dumpling skin has a very nice consistency while the filling was very flavorful. The fried dumplings were a little underwhelming but still good.  Prices are also fair at around $8-$12 for 15 dumplings.   Lastly, the food does take a while to come out, but it's very fresh and definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing Dumplings. You can get them steamed, boiled or pan fried. We got the Pan Fried Dumpings with Beef Onion Curry and the Boiled Pork with Chinese Vegetables. Both were fantastic and each order came with 15 dumplings.  Overall, great place for a quick afternoon snack. Very affordable too."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé cette établissements, très propre pour le quartier chinois, je conseil les dumpling dans une soupe, c'est différent mais aussi delicious"}
{"text":"The place is a little tight. It makes you feel very cozy with your neighbors.  Food is excellent if you are into dumplings. You can see them making it in the back through the glass window. We had pork w Chinese cabbage steam mode, curry beef and pork w shrimp fried style. Delicious. Definitely a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Host was very slow taking the order. Did not liked fried versions... Prefer steam. Vegetarian options did not taste very good either."}
{"text":"Even after seeing the reviews, I didnt have a lot of expectations for this restaurant. When we got there, the dumplings (not soup dumplings) were actually juicy and full of flavour which is usually my problem with dumplings. Humble exterior, great food. If you're looking for a sign on whether or not to go here, this is it."}
{"text":"En visite Montréal, hands down les meilleurs DimSum que j'ai mangé. Le concept cuisine ouverte est sympa. Je n'oublierai pas cet endroit !"}
{"text":"Parfois, quand tous les avis sont aussi positifs, on se doit d'aller vérifier et VITE !  Et en effet, ce sont les meilleurs dumpling ever !  Nous avons pris 2 boites de 15 à emporter, pour un prix vraiment petit.   Les dumplings sont savoureux, juteux et gourmands. Le genre d'adresse vraiment magique car tout est dans la tradition et la qualité. On redevient un peu touriste le temps d'un repas..."}
{"text":"This was everything and more as so many \"Yelpers\" had previously described. We started with a Jellyfish vegetable salad and a cabbage/wasabi salad both were excellent, fresh cabbage, carrot, cellophane noddles and jellyfish nicely seasoned both with wonderful flavors from sesame oil and rice-wine vinegar and delightfully alternating textures. Dumplings are served steamed/boiled (Chiao Tzu) or fried (Kuo Tieh) and come 15 per order at $8 to $10CDN depending on what you order, a real value. We selected Kuo Tieh beef with onion and Kuo Tieh pork with shrimp. They arrived at our table fried to golden perfection, the dough was much lighter and more delicate than the average pot sticker served here in the States and the fillings for both our orders were excellent making it hard to chose a favorite. Condiments were hot red pepper chili oil and a dark vinegar which you could combine or use separately, either way this was a taste bud experience of the highest order, so good in fact we went back the next evening and did a repeat."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the pork, shrimp, and coriander dumplings fried. Such a great combination of flavors.  You can watch the dumplings being hand made. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings! I couldn't believe how good these dumplings were. This is a pretty small restaurant that and I had heard the dumplings were good, but I wasn't expecting THIS good. My girlfriend said it's her second favorite dumplings she's ever had (after White Bear in Flushing, Queens, NY) and she's spent a lot of time in China. We were exhausted after our drive up to Montreal and we just wanted to quickly grab some delicious food. Mai Xiang Yuan came through! The portions are pretty big, the dumplings are fresh and delicious and it is not very expensive. Definitely worth stopping by if you're ever in the Chinatown section of Montreal."}
{"text":"Despite the restaurant's old and unnoticeable apparence, the dumplings are freaking delicious. I'm not the biggest fan of dumplings usually but this place made me change my mind. The pork and beef are the best. My personal favorite are the pork and mushroom dumplings. SKIP THE LAMB, the taste is weird."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is PACKED on weekends. The dumplings are good and made to order, super fresh and cheap! Always order the lamb+onion, pork and chives dumplings. Honestly the best. Because its so busy, sometimes the staff get orders mixed up so be prepared to wait ~25 minutes for your meal :(."}
{"text":"****Cash only, cash only!!!!!*****  Hopefully you have avoided the pitfall of asking to pay with a credit card.  Food is wonderful, services is a bit odd, but livable.    Variety is the spice of life so pay the half dollar and split plates to try more."}
{"text":"4 star for the boiled dumplings! Pork, Shrimp and Shitake Mushroom ($8.49) was just so good! The wrapping was cooked to perfect with a chewiness with all the goodness of soupy filling still inside.  1 star for the fried dumplings! Curry Beef ($9.49) was meh! The wrapping still raw and you can see the white flour. Fillings was just so dry.  I guess don't order the fried version then we will be happy.  Mai Xiang Yuan maybe one of the more expensive dumplings I had but seems to be the price point for Montreal.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Oh dear lord, DUMPLINGS. Mai Xiang Yuan is clearly THE place to get dumplings in Montreal's Chinatown, and thank god we got there right before the lunch rush came in. But our dumplings still took some time to get to our table because when we sat down, they were already processing tons of take out/delivery orders! You can see the adorable group of women filling dumplings in a row, decked out in baseball caps and bright pink polo shirts, in the back kitchen thanks to the large glass window :)  The hot tea was very pleasant to have since it was a chillier day than we've had yet, so we kept warm while we waited. With only two of us, and 15 dumplings per order, we could only try two different ones, so we went with the steamed pork and mushroom, and the pan fried curry beef. The pork ones came out first, and boy are they DELICIOUS! The beef curry ones were up next, and YUM - a bit juicier than the pork for some reason, so we had to be careful with each bite. You have soy sauce, vinegar, and hot chili oil on each table to create your own dipping sauce. Service is fine since even with a small space they fill up immediately and then a line forms outside, so they do try to politely get you to leave asap - or at least that's how I felt. And its so freaking affordable! God, I wish we had them right next door to us..."}
{"text":"Wishing and dreaming I was back in Montreal :( This place mainly serves dumplings but you really wouldn't want anything else.  I wanted to try this place so badly so we got to the restaurant before it opened and waited outside. Yup, sure did!  What we ordered: Fried and steamed pork dumplings. Sooooo yummy and lots of servings (but we still finished both trays). you make your own dipping sauce with soy sauce and chili oil and that's really all you need! Top that with hot tea on the side, perfect meal. I also ordered their seaweed salad and loved it. Now, if you've never had seaweed before, you might find it tasting weird and fishy so just be aware.  It's cool because you can literally see them making dumplings while you eat in the back. They make each and every one of them by hand which takes time.  It is so affordable for how much food you get!"}
{"text":"Holy dumplings! I swear I saw the clouds part and a light shine down as I chewed. I got the beef and coriander pan fried dumplings. Since they're made to order it was understandable why it took a longer than other places. Yet, they came out piping hot and in big portions. I'm not a fan of dumplings or dim sum, but the flavour was phenomenal. I also ordered the cucumber and jelly fish salad. It was a nice crispy texture of cucumber throughout, but they skimped out on the jelly fish and I found it too salty. If I ever return to Montreal, I'm coming back here because they're the only place that can satisfy this dumpling craving I have."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are phenomenal! The skin is homemade, thick and chewy, just the way I like it. Get the shrimp and coriander one boiled and the beef curry one fried. Speaking of which, a very unusual filling for Chinese dumplings..but actually really good! Must try if you like curry."}
{"text":"The steamed small buns are really good even from the perspective of a bun-lover! Dumplings are just so so. Decor is average. Service is great!"}
{"text":"I want to give it a 3.5, but I'm going to go for four cause the dumplings here are pretty delicious! Pork or Beef, they were both pretty good.  Although the carpet and walls are dated and overly used, it had the typical decor of the - over popular restaurant that doesn't really care what they look like - cause their food is all they care for.  I wanted to give this restaurant lower because of a few factors. How when at first searching for this restaurant - it was easy to miss. ( perhaps because I'm from out of town. ) That ordering a glass of ice water meant waiting a while to only get cold tap water. The girl who goes around refilling the tea only came when we first sat down and around the time we were leaving. No one really came to check up on how everything was. How I wished they had red vinegar on our table of self serving sauces.  But I'm going to give them a 4! - cause their dumplings are that freaking good. Even when they don't look like much after coming off the pan."}
{"text":"Being Chinese, I have a high standard for dumplings.   On a one weekend trip from New York to Montreal, I visited this place twice on a friend's recommendation. These were by far the best dumplings I've ever had in my life. I had the pork, shrimp and mushroom boiled dumplings and the pork, shrimp and coriander. Both amazing, super fragrant and just the right amount of skin to meat ratio.   The shop is cozy and clean for Chinatown standards with friendly staff. They also had an amazing chili sauce that was the perfect balance of spice and flavor without being too spicy and overpowering the flavor of the dumpling.   I would order these frozen online if I could and eat them everyday."}
{"text":"This place was jammed packed Friday night. Like every other dumpling joint, this is a hole in the wall. Cramped quarters elbow to elbow with fellow diners locals and tourists alike.   A plate of dumplings will run you about 10 dollars more or less, with 15 dumplings per plate. If you're not insanely hungry, one plate per person would do. I stuck to pan-fried pork and leek and steamed pork mushroom and shrimp because I never mess with the \"classics\". The wait is a tad on be long side but you get free hot tea to tie you over (mine was served in a 12 oz drinking glass and replaced with another glass promptly after finishing. Interesting to say the least.)  The filling of the pork and leek was more flavorful of the two but I preferred the steamed style. There was something about the way the dumplings tasted that was a tad \"off\" about the pan-fried dumplings. Maybe it was old fry oil or something but it was too savory / salty on the outside to really appreciate the flavor inside. NYC's prosperity dumpling blows theirs out of the water undoubtably. And call me a gringo, but I prefer Sriracha over hot chili oil on my dumplings. The skin wasn't too hot either (I like a slightly thicker skin with an Al-dente chew). I wish the shrimp was ground up finely in the shrimp and pork dumplings- it's nice to know they put a substantial amount of succulent tasty shrimp in their dumplings but I think the flavor is better when the shrimp are ground, but that's just me.    I'm not breaking my pelvis to return here but it's pretty solid. Not Prosperity or Vanessa's dumpling level good though.   Don't look down on the floor because it's carpet matted with old dirt, gravel and other grime from the streets of Montreal. Im sure they attempt to clean it and is in no way a commentary about the hygiene of the food but I would suggest pulling up the carpet and just having bare carpet for the customer's dining pleasure. Store owners are incredibly nice and attentive by the way."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here after ice skating at Old Port Montreal in early December.    The dumplings were great in warming us up.  since i'm vegetarian, we ordered the tomato and egg dumpling (an interesting take on the classic chinese dish of tomato and eggs).  It's the only true vegetarian dumplings - the other \"vegetarian\"  dumplings have dried shrimp in them.   Each dish came with ~15 dumplings.  We got half cooked and half steamed; I think the cooked ones were much better than the fried ones.  Importantly, the cost of the dumpling is very reasonable @ C$9 for our plate of dumplings."}
{"text":"I haven't had dumplings this good since I left Vancouver, this place is legit. Cheap and plentiful with a ton of veggie-friendly options and super helpful wait staff. Came here on a Friday night and the place was like a nightclub: people were lining up both for staying in and for take away and the waitress was running around the tables, flat out while still smiling. The crispy shrimp was my hands down favourite; mmm, now I am hungry and nowhere near St-Laurent, grrr."}
{"text":"Taking the price into consideration, 'mai xiang yuan' gets the upper hand on 'qing hua' by ~2$ on 15 fried dumplings.   I had pork and cabbage fried dumplings at both places and they tasted quite similar although I found mai xiang yuan's pork tasted fresher and not frozen.   So far the best dumplings I've had in MTL"}
{"text":"Having parents who make very good dumplings by the standards of the chinese, I walked into this small restaurant with high bars. I ordered fried pork and leek dumplings and they didnt disappoint me. The things that were missing are the ingredients for a good dipping sauce. They only had vinegar, soy sauce, and some kind of chili sauce.   The glasses and the chopsticks were kind of dirty (or old looking actually) so make sure to wipe them with a napkin before using them!"}
{"text":"Having never sampled a truly fresh dumpling in my life, I was eager to try this. Located in the heart of Montreal's very awesome Chinatown, this spot certainly commands a stop when around. From my visit: the resulting elation led to the summary destruction of all frozen dumplings contained within my condo.  Fresh, Tasty, flavourful. Prepared before your eyes, and brought out piping hot. Fried, boiled, and tasty. My favourites of the day were a toss up between beef and onion and beef curry.  This is certainly a must return, just to try more combinations."}
{"text":"I have been to this dumpling spot four times now. So incredibly delicious every single time! First time in I ordered fried and boiled dumplings to have a go at both. I now only order the boiled dumplings and I always get the pork, cilantro and shrimp AND the pork and cabbage. They burst with moisture and flavour. I've had the cucumber salad which is good and the chili oil is fantastic too. I feel it is great value for the price. Only problem is... I don't live in Montreal and have to wait to experience them. Truly worth going for."}
{"text":"Great food, great price. Slow service, but the food made up for it. We ordered two different shrimp dumplings, one fried, and they were both yummy.  Also seaweed salad and cucumber salad for only 2$ each??? Can't believe we finished it all."}
{"text":"OK food. But HORRIBLE service :( the waitress messed up the order and then lied about how long the food would take."}
{"text":"Traveling for work I had no idea what where to go for dinner. I yelped around my hotel and came across this place. When I arrived on a saturday evening, the place was packed, but they cleared away a table in the back for me. I ordered the beef curry onion dumplings (recommended fried) and the pork and shrimp dumplings (boiled). I also had the cucumber and jellyfish app. The dumplings were juicy, flavorful, and filling. The pork and shrimp were definitely better than the beef ones, but both were tasty nonetheless. My only criticism was the fact that it's cash only and the servers were not very attentive (received app last and water was never replenished). The food itself was good, but when looking at the entire experience, there's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"It is now 6 times I have come here and everyone has been a 5 star and same for my guests I have brought....They know me well enough now. I even feel at easy to speak to them in chinese with the little I know.   Great work keep it up."}
{"text":"We ordered the bokchoy+pork and the shrimp, pork and coriander dumplings, all boiled.  For side dishes, we also ordered the seaweed and \"wood-ear\" salads.  The dumpling wrappers were thin and wonderfully silky, really enjoyable texture.    Small menu with limited options, just the way it should be for authentic dumplings.     Very simple, cafeteria-like environment, but it's all about the dumplings in my mind, and this place totally delivers."}
{"text":"Even though I do not have extensive experience in soup dumplings, these were the best I've tried. I especially loved it for the small family run atmosphere. The wait staff was extremely courteous, and best of all they included hot tea with the order (which other dumpling places in the area did not)."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place was so highly rated. They took more than 35 minutes to serve our food (which is JUST dumplings--and only 30 of them). It wasn't that busy, yet the service was horrendous. They were dismissive, rude, slow, and clumsy."}
{"text":"If nothing else, try the beef and curried onion fried dumplings. They were absolutely incredible when we came here.  Service is severely lacking here, but the dumplings are stellar."}
{"text":"Almost tastes as good as the dumplings that my dear grandmother used to make. Everything I want from a dumpling shop."}
{"text":"Cheap, hot, and delicious. What more could you ask for? Oh, and not to mention FRESH and tons of variety. Vegetarian dumplings, beef dumplings, pork dumplings, seafood dumplings.  If you're in the mood for a snack, one order (which comes with 15 dumplings) should be more than enough to nosh on. Rus and I split an order of the pork and seaweed fried dumplings. Took about 15 minutes to receive them, but the wait was definitely worth it! Oh and because this place is so popular, you might have to wait a few minutes for a seat, but don't let that scare you away!  Great eats to fuel your tummy while you're walking the streets of Montreal. I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian dumplings freshly hand made daily..friendly service this is a great little spot in Chinatown"}
{"text":"Good dumplings, huge portions and cheap prices! Even their beer is cheap! My only problem is that despite their ever growing popularity and even the fact they expanded into a bigger location next door, they still don't take any cards. Their atm machine is often broken as well, leaving me frustrated that its always complicated to pay for my nice meal."}
{"text":"If you are a dumpling lover, this is a must try when visiting Montreal.  The dumplings are made fresh right before they are cooked, and you have 3 options: boiled, steamed, or fried (frying costs $1 extra).  15 pieces per order for ~$8-10 is a great value.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!   One order of dumplings is plenty for anyone.  I ordered dumplings and soup and it was way too much.  Dumplings were fresh and delicious.  My food was served very quickly, maybe because I went between lunch and dinner.  So glad I went."}
{"text":"A great dumpling joint in Chinatown! No more need to go \"all the way\" to Qing Hua for my dumpling fix. Of course, it doesn't compare to some of the restos in Toronto but it will do while waiting for my next road trip. The dumplings served are not xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and are served in a variety of different fillings. All you need is a little vinegar and chili paste as dipping.  We had the shrimp, egg and leek steamed dumplings and the curried beef pan fried dumplings. Both were very flavorful and so juicy that you should really eat it all in one bite unless you want to risk squirting the juice all over you. I will need to go back to try out the rest of the menu.  My only complain is that I wish they would give complementary salad as well as serve the dumplings in portion of 10, rather than 15. This way, one could try a wider variety."}
{"text":"Best dumplings on the east coast. And I know dumplings being from New York. Had beef coriander soup - sick."}
{"text":"I'm not new to dumplings. I've been trained to make them, and I think I do an excellent job at it. These might be a little bit better looking than mine, but they taste just as fresh - meaning these are exceptional \"home made\" dumplings. The flavors are bright and fresh and the dough has just the right texture. Additionally, their prices are quite reasonable, although I will admit that perhaps their dining space could use a little sprucing up."}
{"text":"I want to give it more stars..but I can't. From the three different dumplings I tried here, I would firstly definitely recommend getting it boiled, not pan fried. I tried pork, leek, and cilantro dumplings pan fried and it was honestly subpar. It lacked juice and flavor, and the skin was quite dry. The vegetable dumpling we got also lacked somewhere, couldn't pinpoint it. The best would be the traditional pork and leek dumplings, boiled. Each bite was filled with pork juices inside, with a good balance of everything. Other than that, not sure if there are better dumpling places around. This place was also very popular, even early on a Friday."}
{"text":"This is a dumpling restaurant (there is not much else on the menu). They are very greasy and salty, even the steamed ones. I did not enjoy them at all."}
{"text":"Ca fait la job ... Pas tres savoureux mais la texture des dumpling frits est gratifiante. La salade pas tres epicé .. Gout presque neutre .. Il faut dire que je ne suis pas une fan de dumplings mais j'ai deja gouté mieux."}
{"text":"Went here for dumplings the other day and the dumplings at this place were amazing! One is the best dumpling places.  They have a section for vegetarian dumplings and we ordered two types - tofu and mushrooms. Both were delicious and quickly devoured! Not much options for beverages hence only 4 stars. But service was fast and friendly. It's cash only place."}
{"text":"I love a good, classic, simple boiled dumpling. And Mai Xiang Yuan makes those. The throughput of the kitchen is fantastic, and it makes sure your dumpling filling hasn't been sitting around.   That's great.  What I don't quite understand is all the love for this place. It's solid. No doubt. But there's nothing here that is quite deserving of all the adulation.   When we arrived for dinner, there was a wait to get a table. Other places in Chinatown had no wait. Unless you have your heart set on boiled dumplings, there's really no reason to wait on these.   Of course, waiting does help to heighten the anticipation. And you may be hungrier when you finally sit down. Both of those things can work together to make food taste especially good.  Maybe that's what is going on at this modest dumpling parlor.   Definitely worth a stop. Probably not quite worth the wait. If you see a line, I'd suggest heading down the street for a bowl of noodles first. Then meander back for a second course of dumplings. Then stroll down the main drag and pick up a small sweet for dessert."}
{"text":"Did someone say dumplings? Shall I admit that a lot of our time was spent in Chinatown during this visit to Montreal?  I love dumplings. I'm a dumpling fanatic. Always have been. So, we grabbed 2 orders of dumplings here today: the boiled pork variety and the steamed shrimp, leek and egg style.   Both were fabulous.  We thought were also going to order soup dumplings, but they don't have them here. Want those slurp-able dumplings? Go next door to Bon Maison...same owners...different dumplings.  We figured if we didn't overdo the first round that we could stop by and grab soup dumplings later in the day. Which is exactly what we did. Stand by for that review, too.  When we arrived, the place was packed...only one table available pour deux. Parfait!! (Sorry...practicing mon Français).  Complimentary tea is provided by the only (seulement) girl (fille) working the whole place. She manages to keep things going...juggling waiting tables, bussing and seating hungry humans.  A couple of tips: -cash only. First hint? Cash machine jammed into the already small entrance -don't wait for her to bring the check...just go to the counter and pay (cash) there  Overall, a good pick for dumplings."}
{"text":"mai xiang yuan was one of my favorite restaurants in montreal. it probably has a lot to do with the fact that i LOVE dumplings. besides that, the experience of getting completely lost, turned around, and without cell/wifi signal only to run right into the restaurant makes for a boring story no one cares about.  we split an order of pork and cabbage dumplings as well as the beef and curry onion dumplings. both are very good... but the beef and curry was the winner. only by a margin though.  if you're loafing around china town, stop by for lunch. this place gets super packed so try to go during an off time. you can watch them making fresh dumplings in the back. get it as a plate of them or in soup. don't think you can go wrong... and grab a sesame ball from one of the bakeries near by if you have any room left."}
{"text":"Crispy and fresh, so good! Can be hardly find even in New York Chinatown! Must try the one side fried dumplings. I would highly recommend this to my friends in Montreal ."}
{"text":"Very good dumplings. Highly recommend the steamed lamb and coriander dumplings. The food is made to order and in the open kitchen you can see older Chinese ladies making the dumplings. It's a no frills kind of place but it's delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"Excellentes bouchées vapeur pour vraiment pas cher. Les dumplings sont faites au fur et à mesure des commandes et je n'ai jamais été déçue. Le lieu ne donne pas spécialement envie de prime abord mais le service est correct et  la nourriture est tellement bonne que j'y retourne régulièrement. Attention, en heure de pointe il est difficile de trouver une table de libre."}
{"text":"Worst service. Waited 15 minutes for table.  Waitress spilled tea over my shoes and did not even stop to apologize. Had to wait 40 minutes for my fried dumplings. The waiter kept telling me that the fried dumpling take longer but I saw he brought food to at least three tables that came in after I arrived. After 40 minutes of waiting, the waiter told me that he mistakenly gave my order to another table.  Didn't wanna wait another 40 minutes for my order. Kitchen was closing in 15 minutes so the waiter told me that my only option was that I had to take the steamed dumplings that he was supposed to give to the other table who got my order.  I left the restaurant after one hour of sitting there with no food and to the three people that worked there it was no big deal. They just shrugged their shoulders. I will never return to this place again."}
