{"text":"Bicycled my way here today from Urbana on the new Kickapoo Rail Trail.  This is a nice small town bar.  The two ladies working the bar were nice and friendly.  The Bud Light can I drank was COLD.  I ordered a double cheeseburger with all my favorite fixings.  It was greasy and good.  Had a side of coleslaw that was pretty good as well.  The bartender graciously refilled my water bottle for me.  I'll be back next time I find myself in St. Joe for sure."}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this place. Went here for dinner. Sat at table for 30 minutes, by the time the server came around to check on us , we asked for menus and she informed us the kitchen closed 5 minutes prior so she could not accept our order. We talked to management and told them the situation, even offering to pay an extra $100 for them to serve us. They said that would not be fair because at least 5 other tables have requested dinner also.???  (Great business model).  Unfortunately, we were told they could not serve us dinner no matter what.  We asked if we could order takeout and have it delivered.  They told us that was illegal to have outside food on the premises.  That is a lie.  We asked for our bill and left.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Service was non-existent.  Couldn't get anyone to wait on us.  Very poor. Went to Monicals instead."}
{"text":"Lovely local place. Fun people and great servers. Bad thing is the grill and kitchen hours. Can't meet up with friends on a weekend evening have drinks and wings past 9 pm. Does not qualify as a cool dive bar!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!! We like to go here for great American food, i.e. burgers, fries, other fried goodies! Worth the little drive."}
{"text":"So disappointed tonight.  I brought a friend from out of town and out of state here.  I really like this place so i wanted the best.  But he was from California so wasn't ready to eat as early as us.  We asked for menus at 9:03.  Waitress told us we could no longer order food.  We offered $100 to the cooks plus our dinner costs and she said that would not be fair because at least 5 other tables wanted dinner too and they would be jealous.  I don't think I can ever go here again because they clearly don't care about thier customers.  They also tried some angle about it being illegal for us to bring in food of our own from local delivery options and oddly enough i've done a little digging and it's actually a town law that they have to serve food in order to serve alcohol.  Very shady and not friendly. So disapointed.  Chips or fries would have made things better.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Great new place to catch the game, grab a bite and get your favorite beverage. Plus, they're expanding with a game room. Family friendly as well."}
{"text":"Ordered a cajun chicken sandwich and split an order of onion rings. The sandwich was simple but good. The onion rings were OUTSTANDING!!! Servers were very nice too. I'm glad we stopped here for dinner!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food. Good greasy burgers. My wife likes the mahi mahi fish basket. Double Frisco melt is really a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Love to go this place for a good burger. If you order food/soda you could get out of there for under 10$ with tips. I will admit service can bad when they are busy. The bar is nothing wild, has the typical beer, few wines, and some hard liquors. It will get loud in there when a big sporting event is going on."}
{"text":"Perfect little bar , great food , great vibe , COLD beer , if you want a good night out, this is the place, if you want a black tie event go somewhere else"}
