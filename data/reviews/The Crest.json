{"text":"Dear The Crest,

What are you, a bar?  A restaurant?  A club wanting to be both?  ordered fries with dip, calamari and one other starter.  They arrived in 30 seconds, fresh from the microwave? Unfortunatly it wasn't just the food that left a bad taste in my mouth, we (wife and I) were told \"sorry, service isn't going to be to good tonight, I have a really demanding table over there\"...so, does this mean we can expect bad service?  don't ask for anything lest we also be labeled a demanding table?  

i'll skip and go to Dave's up the street next time, or stazione.."}
{"text":"The crest is a nice cozy place on the st clair strip. The restaurant is pretty unique compared to other pubs in Toronto. Decor is dim and stylish, and they have really comfortable seating with leather couches, so it's sort of a pub/lounge atmosphere. I usually get the peroni on tap, and I've tried a few dishes there. Love the hillcrest burger and fries! Burger is nicely charred and cooked medium. Fries are thin sliced with the skins and lots of flavour. The truffle mac and cheese is also a fave! Menu prices are pretty decent, I'm surprised not more people have discovered this place."}
{"text":"We checked the place out and were positively surprised. First of all it looks pretty cool inside.

Food and drinks are really good as well. We had the wings with NY butter sauce (variation of hot)..,, really delicious. The sliders were awesome and so were the fried calamari. 

Pricewise a little on the upper end, but really worth it."}
{"text":"Don't go to the crest.. They have such a bad food; oily, few and not tasteful at all. The worst part was the price!!! I didn't eat anything and I had to pay for it"}
{"text":"Good location since we live in the area. Heard about this place from a friend. Came here for a hockey game and dinner. Lots of Tvs, which was great. Service was incredibly slow on several occasions. Got our appetizers after one hour, they brought us a free pitcher for the long wait. The food was worth it, it was pretty good. Asked for a glass of water which took another 15 minutes. Very frustrating if we weren't watching the game but we were so we were more patient. Might come back to see if it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is great. The decor is fabulous and so is the food. All the staff has been super friendly every time I've been in. It's a refreshing take on a pub/lounge atmosphere, especially on St. Clair."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of The Crest.  Their food is excellent - I have eaten here at least 20 times and have honestly never been disappointed.  They take great pride in the food that they serve, and you can tell.  The NY Butter wings are very special, if you are fan of authentic Buffalo wings, you will love these!

I have always had great, personable service.  They had a bartender working there for a while who wasn't very friendly, but she has since moved on.

The reason I have not given them 5 stars is because I have gone there on more than one occasion after checking their website to see if they are open, only to find them closed.  The hours posted on the door said that they should have been open, and they weren't.  Its actually a running joke in our family now because it has happened more than once.  Like 3 or 4 times.  Shame on us, that we can't remember, but shame on them for not being clear on their site and on the actual premises.

That said, I can't let that stop me from going there again, the food and atmosphere and staff are so great, very unique to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A new delight has graced the streets of the ever changing St Clair Ave West landscape. The Crest, a refreshing change from the numerous Italian, Latin American and breakfast nooks that have owned the strip for the last number of years, is a sophisticacted and enjoyable dining experience without breaking the bank. 
Unfortunately, this is something that can easily be missed as the exterior is very simple, sleek and black which may make one thing it is a night club. But step inside and take in the atmosphere which, with soft lighting,exposed brick, numerous chandeliers, and mirrors of varying size and shape evokes the feeling of a European resto-bar. The backyard, heated patio is beautifully made and a nice touch with colder weather just around the corner. The only detraction is the numerous flatscreen televisions that seem to remind you that you are in fact on St. Clair Ave and the next football match, (unfortunately, probably not hockey this year) is available here too! However, the food and environs make the tv's bareable. Our party of four starts with the shared plates and we are informed by our very friendly and extremely helpful server that the menu is meant to be shared. 

Our party chose the Coq Au Vin Poutine (yes you read that right), the Mussels in White Wine Sauce and the Buttermilk Calamari. The poutine was simply devine. The chicken and gravy complemented each other beautifully and for such a heavy sounding dish, it was actually quite light. However, that may have had something to do with the fact that I was forced to share it. The calamari batter contained faintly chopped pieces of jalapeno (and another unidentified) peppers which gave the light batter a wonderful little kick which complimented the dipping sauce perfectly. The white wine sauce of the mussles was delicious and fragrant and my dear husband could not stop himself from dredging his accompanying bread in the bottom of the bowl. As we are four East Coasters we are particular about our seafood and did feel that the mussels were slightly over steamed. Information which we relayed to our server, but nothing that would stop me from ordering them again.

The mains ordered were two New York Strip steaks and two Bar Burgers (not very adventurous at this point, I know) accompanied by two orders of Truffle Fries for sharing. 
The comments from our party on the steak was that both were cooked perfectly and they had just the perfect criss-cross charring pattern which is a good indicator that there is a good grill and the chef knows what he is doing. The Bar Burger is anything but your average burger. The bun was warm, buttery and so tasty, yet it did not swallow up the burger which was cooked to perfection and served with lettuce, tomato, pickle and a wonderful shallot aioli. For an extra charge we added Gouda cheese and avocado which simply enhanced the flavour. And finally, the Truffle Fries.Our server explained that they have a slightly distinct flavour (as you would expect) and if upon trying them we did not like them we could send them back as they may not appeal to everyone's palate. The only thing we sent back were our cute, white empty bowls they came in. The fries were thin cut, (same for the Coq Au Vin Poutine) fried and yes, there certainly was a distinct, earthy taste, that was delicious and different and kept us wanting more. The only unfortunate thing I have to say is that this might turn into the type of restaurant where I simply order the same thing over and over because I enjoyed it so much. 

For a party of four that included seven alcoholic beverages and the aforementioned, the bill was approximately $170.00 Well worth it for great food and atmosphere and something different all within walking distance from home."}
{"text":"The Crest is an interesting place. I've been here three times. Once in the summer and twice in the wintertime. In the summer, I sat on the patio and had some nibbles while drinking a decent lager.  The service was good and the atmosphere was very nice.

Both times I've come in the winter I've been slightly disappointed. The bar is usually pretty empty and the service has been kinda spotty.   The food and drink all seem to be fairly upmarket and while there are alot of up-market places along this stretch of St Clair, maybe it is missing the mark just a touch."}
{"text":"Visited Thur Dec 4 for a special event. Arrived at 7pm and the place was half-full. Our party was approximately 30 people. Strongbow in a can was the only cider available. There were some food platters but I didn't get to try any of it. The atmosphere was relaxed and casual. The other guests ate up all the food so that was a good sign. Would come back again in the future."}
{"text":"This place has a totally beautiful decor. From the leather wrap, to the dim Edison bulbs, to the knotty pine Tables and cozy chairs.
The burger I had was one of the best on st clair. The fries are blanched and crispy the way I like it.  I also like the fact that they have peroni on tap and a back patio. :)"}
{"text":"It's okay. Just another Bar. It is out of the way for me so I probably wouldn't go there again unless attending an event."}
{"text":"Okay, Bistro Sports  Pub....hmmm...okay.  Well, the decor is nice. It's fancy but welcoming. It feels a bit odd to be in a place this nice with ultimate fighting posters on the walls but despite the clash of 'vibes' it seems to work. The servers were good, happy and friendly. I did think there was a lack of craft or micro-beer choices for a place like this but I wasn't drinking the night I went so I let it slide. The food was slow but good. The burger was AMAZING. IT is one of my top 3 burgers ever. The thing that holds me back a bit from really praising this place is the price. The Crest ain't cheap, it ain't even a little pricey. It's fully pricey. The burger with all the fixin's and fries was almost 20 bucks (the fries were 5 bucks a la carte). The drinks were also on the high end. I'd like to try some of the other menu items but I'm torn. I like the place but it's not a joint I can go to regularly and still pay my mortgage without feeding gruel to my family 4 days a week. I would give it 3.5 stars if yelp let me just for causing me such anguish. That burger calls to me though. My arteries long to be wrapped in it's cholesterol hug...Does my daughter really need to go to university? I'll think about it but if you have good credit y'all can venture to the Crest for some food and sports."}
{"text":"As full-time working parents of a young child, it is a big deal and we were very excited to get a babysitter last night and go out on a date!  We picked The Crest because it is local and I had heard good things about it.  I looked on their website and on Yelp (of course) and we were set to go.

Upon walking up to the door of The Crest, we found a sign \"closed Dec 31 - Jan 7\".  It would have been nice if they posted this closing on their website.  Everyone deserves time off and holidays but we were totally disappointed!  We ended up walking down the street to another place to eat."}
{"text":"The Summerlicious menu is excellent based on its taste and value. The only concerns is that TIPS added into our bill which surprised me. The amount is 18% which is average but made me feel wield and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"By and large I like this place -- the food is tasty, original and reasonably priced, the beers on tap include the standard stuff as well as labels you see less often, it's also a place where you can take your kids for dinner and not feel weird or out of place.
That said, as some of the earlier reviewers have noted, this does feel like a place that hasn't fully figured out its identity -- whether its a sports bar, a gastropub, or something else. Maybe in time this will settle as it establishes itself in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a sports bar with class and a killer kale salad?  Oh yes.
I'm confused by this place as it has a higher end classy feel to it, but has TVs showing sports. Some people show up in jogging pants and baseball caps and other people are dressed nicely.  The food and portions are good and the prices are decent. They have a few nice cocktails as well. Overall I think I like this place. It has a cozy classy vibe and is a good place for a drink. And lets be honest, it's the modestly priced cocktails that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot on the St.clair west strip. The Crest is with family friendly and a fun place to chill with friends, hang out on the front or back patio and by the bar. had this crazy braised beef poutine with a cheesy béchamel sauce...so friggin good."}
{"text":"Fancy type pub. Good food although we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"A group of us tried The Crest out for the first time and had a so-so experience. On a positive note, the food was great; particularly the truffle mac and cheese which was definitely a highlight of the evening. The atmosphere is also great - a real lounge feel with leather couches and great sight lines to big TV screens where we were able to watch the Raptors game.

Unfortunately, the service was quite slow and inattentive. We waited about 45 minutes to get our food, were only checked on once throughout the meal and were not offered any more drinks or dessert. 

May visit again, but not anytime soon."}
