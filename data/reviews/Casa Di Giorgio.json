{"text":"Had a great meal last night at Casa Di Giorgio - the one on Mt Pleasant, near Millwood Rd.  I had my fave appetizer, Sausage & Peppers: the sliced sausage have a slight heat to them, but the homemade tomato sauce is to die for.  Exactly what the fresh bread loaf is there for.

Also had their Pizza Pavarotti: pepperoni, green peppers, bacon, mushrooms, onions.  Too juicy for picking up, but tasted great.

They also have a $24.95 three course special.  Bring your apettite!  Soup or salad, pasta, dessert and coffee.  The Pasta Giorgio (Fettucine Alfredo with chicken, mushrooms and peas) came steaming hot to the table.

A great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is okay. It is so close to where I live, that I had to try it out. 

The calamari is what it shouldn't be - overly fishy in taste and rubbery - honestly, one of the worst calamari's I have ever had. Not recommended. For $8, you would expect better. 

The pizza is pretty good, but expensive too. The Pavarotti pizza with pep, mush, g pepper, bacon, onions and tomatoes is $17 for a small...yes a small. 

Again, for these prices, I expect better quality."}
{"text":"Half the cute restaurants on Mt Pleasant either aren't open when I walk by, or they sppokily never have customers. I had convinced myself it was the economy, and was in a mood to give something in Davisville a try. 

We were one of 2 tables Casa di Girgio served that evening, but it was anything but a cold atmosphere-- candlelight, a soft-spoken server, and a cozy booth made us feel comfortable.

The griled calamari appetizer was huge, served on a salad with plenty of bruschetta, and perfectly spiced. My entree salad was overkill, but was really fresh and delish. 

My friend had a piping hot lasagna served in that ramekin-thing-- that they cook it in-- and the sauce was very good. 

We read that they also deliver homemade pizza. 

This place made me want to try more Mt. Pleasant restaurants despite never seeing these establishments patronized."}
