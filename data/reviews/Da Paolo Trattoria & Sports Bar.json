{"text":"This is one of those restaurants where the food is not good and the prices are too high. The food took quite a bit of time to arrive. Our server was friendly.
We wanted to have a quick bite on our way to home so we directly ordered the main-course, but food took over 45 mins to arrive and there was only two other couples in the restaurant while we were there.

Complimentary bread was served which was dry, stale and cold. Our server replaced the bread based on our feedback which helped it being cold but it was dry and stale nevertheless. The oil brought to the table didn't smell or taste like olive oil (could have been Canola). 

I ordered a salmon fillet and it was probably the worst salmon filet I have ever had. The tomato sauce tasted out of the can. The olives and capers in the sauce were from the can too as they both were overly salty. 
Wife ordered Mushroom Risotto which was decent.

If I get a choice to eat here or not at all, I'll save my appetite for next morning."}
{"text":"Food is very good, wait staff  is friendly. highly recommend the location. Sometimes it takes a while to get your food but overall a good place to have a couple pints and relax"}
{"text":"Da Paolos has it all. The sports bar is great for a beer & a bite to eat , watch a game or just chilling out. 
If you want a nice atmosphere for a special occasion or a really nice meal out the Trattoria is a perfect choice. 
The menu is great and the items we have had are excellent. Lasagna, steak, salads, gnocci all wonderful."}
{"text":"Arghhhh!!! 
My hubby brought a group on se we went to try this place in Mono/ Caledon. 
First of all, the name on the restaurant has changed as per \"sign boards\" but not anywhere else that includes google, yelp, maps, and on the restaurant's menu...

There are 3 different dine in rooms, different ambiance but the menu is same and the prices are different!!! 

Although the restaurant looked renovated but looks like they need to work on their menu first.

I ordered mushroom risotto for mains. The mushrooms were all raw. My husband ordered fish which was like frozen and stale. Even the sauce was out of the can. They were for $21 and $22 respectively. Over over over priced  of what they served.

The complimentary bread was stale, and oil was some cheap vegetable oil. 

The food was not worth at all.

They only good part of our visit was our server, Mary! She is polite, prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar bantering with some locals while we ordered food and everything was great especially the grilled Calamari."}
{"text":"The food was so good!!  My husband and I have been there twice now on a Thursday night to the bar side.  He ordered hot wings, and I had the Sicilian pizza, the food is prepared as you order, so its a bit of wait, but worth the wait!  There is fresh bread at the table to munch on.  We found the staff to be very friendly, it's been renovated with new a look, and it's a nice family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here today for first time. It is 1 place that shares 1 kitchen but they poorly attempt to divide it into 2 places, 1 a restaurant and 1 side a bar with dine-in seating. They look exactly the same except one side has a bar (where we met an intrusive lonely drunk biker; 15 yr loyal customer). We went to the restaurant side and were presented with 3 menus. All menus have the same items with different prices! We all picked our items, asked a few questions (why 3 prices? why 3 menus? etc.) and were told sorry that is for the other side, so the owner/waiter made us all get up, gather our stuff, and move to the bar side where we met that biker and about 30 people in different groups sitting waiting for food or their orders to be taken (none of them had food in front of them). So when we got to the bar side, she said the prices are different here. Now I'm annoyed, we are grown adults, you are making us play musical rooms/chairs, changing the prices on us after I asked \"which price is it?\" and she quoted the lower price. It is the SAME KITCHEN, so bring the food to restaurant side! Why give us the menu and then tell us to relocate!? Instead you are telling us to leave and go to the room over? We change rooms, and now we have to wait after these 30 hungry people? Get your **** together, con artists. They are shame to the restaurant industry. The owner is basically an amateur who wants to think she is a pro. This is what happens when you put poor mannered lazy people in Caledon. We ended up going to East Side Marios at Airport and Queen (5 minute drive from here) and the service was amazing, food taste was perfect, atmosphere was inviting and comfortable at East Side Marios."}
