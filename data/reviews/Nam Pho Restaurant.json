{"text":"Came here for some Pho and spring rolls. The food was delicious. Place isn't that nice and tables are worn out and nicked everywhere. The manager kept walking around and looking at us. Not sure why but it was a little bit uncomfortable. But no biggie. It was the best option since the other pho place I wanted to go to didn't open until 11. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Very good! Best friend and I ordered the pho ga and the beef chow fun. Both dishes were excellent! Service was fast and great. Very friendly server. Special tea drinks like thai milk tea with boba and mint tea were magnificent. Would highly recommend and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is not your typical pho restaurant.  My son doesn't eat pho, but he manages to find other items on the menu to satisfy his palate.  The owner will make sugesstions for me to try when I am indecisive.  I tried a new item on their menu, the noodle soup with duck and bamboo.  My husband decided to have the egg noodle soup with char siu.  When they brought out my bowl, he was drooling over the pieces of duck.  I dipped the duck into my yummy ginger garlic sauce, and my tastebuds got excited.  This sauce is so much better than the ginger sauce in Chinese cuisine.  Even my husband was dipping his char siu pork into my sauce.  It got messy eating duck, but what the hell, if it taste good, who cares.  I finished everything but the soup, my tummy couldn't expand anymore.

We have eaten their pho and it is really good.  It's all about the broth and it is always consistently good whenever we dine here.  They also have Bun Bo Hue, and they know how to prepare the blood cake.  Oh, did I mention these guys are very generous with the protein.  I was able to convince a friend to dine here after she told me her experience at another pho restaurant nearby that was so ridiculously stingy with the seafood.  She was stunned that the broth was so much tastier here and was surprised how much shrimp and squid was in her pho.  She is now a loyal fan."}
{"text":"It's an odd atmosphere for a restaurant. It's attached right to the supermarket (you literally have a secret door to the supermarket to get to the bathroom). We come back regularly for the pho though. If you can't decide where to go for a random weeknight out, give it a shot."}
{"text":"So I work across the street from this pho place.

I went to this location before they renamed it. 
I think they got new owners also.
But the place is called \"pho dam\" now 
I am not lying when I say this, but the food there is simply amazing. The pho and meat is 10x better than most places around. I usually go to another pho place, but since I went to this one after they reopened, I started going to this one. 

My aunt who is a picky eater says that they make is good"}
{"text":"Sadly, this popular Pho restaurant changed hands not all that long ago, and we were so so so disappointed with our experience under new management.  Staff wasn't nearly as helpful or talkative; and the food (once the highlight of our Pho dining) had sadly lost all taste!  Seriously, how can you have Pho that tastes so bland?  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Best pho in town!!! The broth is super good  I ordered 2 spring rolls with peanut sauce as well, only 3.15$. During lunch time it was kinda busy, so the wait was a little bit long. But everything is worthy at the end. Recommend you guys to give this restaurant a try!!"}
{"text":"The pho had a really nice decent portion of meat. I got p3, which is the beef slices with flank steak as well. Broth is legitimate and the noodle portion was decent. Clean, comfortable environment. Iced coffee is not bad either"}
{"text":"I've been to many pho restaurants back home in New Orleans, and here would be my second time eating Pho here in Arizona. 
I walked in around 12:54PM, so the fact that the restaurant was somewhat empty and tables were in need of cleaning was of the norm since lunch time was ending. 
My server escorted me to a table and gave me a nice, refreshing glass of water to start with before I ordered. Strange first thing I noticed in this restaurant? The fact that he seemed to be the only server on duty, trying to satisfy four other customers. Even so, he was very timely in placing my order and serving my food. I ordered the Pho Tai Nam Chin, which is a usual regular I order in every pho restaurant I go too. I also decided to try their Soursop Tapioca smoothie, because this fruit is definitely something I do not usually see on the smoothie menu. 
Down to the point, when my food finally came in, it was awkward to see that there were no big spoons acquainted with it or already ready at the table-so I did have to go up and personally ask for that. The pho was okay, definitely not the best but also not the worst I have ever eaten. Enough for me to not want to finish the entire bowl of leftover broth although. It didn't exactly fulfill me, I was actually still hungry after eating that. Ah, they also only have one size for the pho bowls which is a tad disappointing but their prices are cheap at 6.95 plus tax for each bowl-and it is a pretty good size. As for the Soursop smoothie? I would not recommend it. Now I know why people don't usually have that fruit on the smoothie menu."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho places I've been to.

I had the steak and brisket pho and was not disappointed. Many places are so over salted, I can hardly stand it, Pho Nam is wonderful and less salty than most."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Tuesday. Service was prompt and very courteous. We ordered the beef pho with everything. It was really delicious with plenty of meat in it. I like how they have redecorated the place. We will be returning soon to try out the other dishes. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I drive all the way from Scottsdale to have their vegetable pho. Everything is fresh and taste really good. Best Pho soup ever"}
{"text":"Good Pho in the Lee Lee Market Building

Only $6.95 for a nice fresh tasting bowl of Pho here. In the building on the left side of the Lee Lee Asian Market.

They have ideas Vietnamese coffee and smoothies too!

Friendly staff.

Good deals on good food!"}
{"text":"I've called numerous times and they never pick up their phone. I'd be nice since people like to order to go often."}
{"text":"Fantastic find! We used to come to Pho 68, which, obviously is not here anymore. This new restaurant exceeded our expectations, in both quality and value of foods. We tried their fresh rolls, they're big and tasty. The C'om and the Bun dishes are generous and, although we haven't yet tried their version of Pho, their Beef Stew with Bread, a traditional Vietnamese dish, was outstanding."}
{"text":"Worst pho place ever!! Waited 40 mins, never got our order and service sucks. I understand you might be busy during lunch time but everyone who ordered after us were almost done and we still didn't get sh!t and no explanation? Avoid at all cost!!! You will regret it."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday in spite of 100 degree temps, and I must say, their air conditioner there works great.  LOL.  I'm half-joking, but for those of you who have a problem sweating profusely over a bowl of Pho like me, this is actually a factor.  =)

The spring rolls were on point and the Pho was good.  Not the best, but good.  Overall, the place is clean and the service was good.  A bit pricier than I had hoped for the size of my bowl."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place.  I've been a regular here since it was Pho 68 and I think the new management is better than Pho 68.  I always order the P5 Pho Tai Bo Vien and it is consistently excellent.  My policy with all Pho is to taste before adding condiments and I generally don't add condiments unless the broth isn't good.  I never add condiments here, just a bit of basil and a squeeze of lime juice.  The noodles are always cooked properly, not mushy.  It's a rather large bowl compared to other places and very reasonably priced at $6.95.  I sometimes get the Goi Cuon (spring rolls) and those are also excellent.  I'm trying to talk myself into trying some Pho Ga or Bun Bo Hue but I just love the Pho Bo too much.

The decor is a little strange, with silk flowers everywhere - but they did improve the appearance since Pho 68.  They still serve Hoisin in Sriracha jars.  I find that a little off-putting.  You are right next to Lee Lee supermarket, surely you could just buy some hoisin jars and then keep refilling those.  The tables are old and a bit beat up looking.  I think with a bit of a facelift this place would go from good to great!  But don't let the decor stop you from enjoying a delicious bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"We came here to eat pho and beef noodle stew..

The food was good and affordable.. Apparently it's new owners and a new restaurant name now.

Everything on the menu are priced very reasonable compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.

The also have smoothies and Vietnamese coffee too!"}
{"text":"I've never been here before and this place is amazing. I had the egg noodle (soft) stir fry. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to finding a good Pho restaurant in the Phoenix area so we visited Nam Pho today {10/30/16). We ordered Pho soup and BBQ Pork Fried Rice. We enjoyed the soup however the rice had a horrible flavor and very greasy. Our waiter never revisited our table after bringing our meal so we didn't have the chance to tell him about the rice. The gentleman cleaning our table couldn't speak good English as we tried to explain to him about the rice. We went up to pay the bill and explained to the server/ cashier that the rice was horrible and we could not eat it. We felt we shouldn't have to pay for it. He got very upset and said \"in an American restaurant, we would have to pay\" but we disagreed and said, if the waiter would come back, we would have told him but he never returned. In American restaurants, they would check on their customers during the meal and ask how their meal is. If something is not satisfactory, it would be replaced or taken away.
The right thing for him to do here would have been to apologize for the badly prepared rice and move on. Instead he argued with us and got very upset. We were not looking for anything free. We are happy to pay the entire bill when the food is edible  It is not a customers responsibility to pay for food that was poorly prepared. It is not at all about the money, it's about a business servicing their customers edible food."}
{"text":"Great service as always & on time. I always get the pho with beef, trip & tendon & have never been dusappointed.
They try to cater to their customers as much as possible. I've asked to gave bbq pork & shrimp in my spring roll & they accomodated with no extra charge. 
Thank you for making it for me!!!"}
{"text":"Just went by this place today. It is now Pho Dam and the grand opening is going on now. I haven't been there yet but hear they redid the whole place! I think I'll try it Tuesday. Has anyone else tried it under the new name? I'll miss their bun rieu, it was really good here."}
{"text":"This place is by my house and a huge bowl of pho is $7.  They're great people, and I can eat there or take home. I'll get take out and heat it at home when I'm hungry. I don't care that it has gone through names and owners, it is still yummy. My kid and I get the thinly sliced beef & I add chile sauce to mine. She asks for extra veggies, and now that I'm writing this I'm hungry. Gotta go so I can go get some pho right now."}
{"text":"It has been a very long time since I walked into this restaurant. The interior looks exactly the same but the staffs definitely look completely different. As soon as I sat down, I've noticed a new name on the menu - yep. They have changed ownership for the 3rd time that I know of. 

No worries. I still want to try out what they have to offer. We are the only table on a Tuesday night, but the service was pretty great. We ordered 4 different types of spring rolls. Most of them taste good except the shredded pork one. I didn't care for the seasoning that they use. We also ordered a round eye beef pho and the broth was just ok. It tastes a bit weird and different than what I am normally used to. 

Since they just started doing business, I am willing to give this place a try again in a few months or so. Overall I think it is worth a try. Their veggie spring rolls are delicious."}
