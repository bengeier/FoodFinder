{"text":"Great little bar with nice atmosphere.  I love the wood on the ceiling and walls.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had Lake Louie on tap.  The location in Black Earth is a bit of a haul for me, though, so I'll have to look forward to the occasional visit when I'm passing through town."}
{"text":"Phenomenal prime rib which comes with garlic mashed potatoes and scallops. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Classic Wisconsin tavern: good beer selection, charming interior, clean restrooms. Food was very tasty; handmade, fresh burger patties!! Volleyball court out back, give this one a try!"}
