{"text":"Came here for their lunch special - chose rice and peas (actually beans), jerk chicken, and coleslaw.  The price of this was apparently raised at the beginning of the year to 5.99+ tax (total 6.77).
The three pieces of chicken was flavorful and super tender - I cut the meat off the bone with a plastic spoon!
The rice was spicy, soft, and filling - I believe they match the rice and meat spice level, so that a mild chicken would be paired with a mild rice.
All the food comes in one container though, so my slaw picked up some spice.

Overall, solid value and good food surprisingly close to UofT, definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"Been here at least 3 times and (I think) went at least once before they changed locations. I've also never had jerk chicken before coming to Toronto that I know of, but after eating at least three different jerk chicken, I have to say that this place is one of, if not the definitive, best places to get jerk chicken. Their jerk chicken practically falls off the bones and is seasoned very well.

They also have a great location for UofT students and pretty good prices. Their jerk chicken special (a small cubular box) is about $6, if I remember correctly, $9 for a regular box that's about twice the size of a special, and $11 for the large, which is maybe 80% larger than a regular (I'm just eyeballing the sizes). I didn't include the tax, so just multiply everything by 1.13 for the final price.

10/10 would recommend. Unless you're not a fan of picking out bones, but I mean, it's a chicken. They have a deboned version of their jerk chicken for I think a dollar extra though, so you can do that if you want. I haven't tried it since a few years back, so iunno how many of these tiny bones they can actually remove."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has really delicious food for great price.
I've been going there everyday for the past year. I just can't find anywhere with better quality vs price balance than this place around UofT."}
{"text":"I have been coming here almost daily for the past few weeks. The food is amazingly good- it is absolutely delicious and well... Tasty! Their special is an awesome deal- salad, chicken and rice for $6. I have tried both their curry and jerk chicken and they are savoury.  What makes this place stand out (thus 5* rating) is the  pleasant and humourous staff at the counter. With great food along with a great working crew- this is my \"go to\" neighbourhood fave!"}
{"text":"This is Jamaican food done right! Amazing! Very clean atmosphere as well. We tried everything and even got food to go. We made a mistake of going to the Real Jerk. So tasty, I closed my eyes, I was in Jamaica Dear God!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the jerk chicken and bbq chicken special over rice and peas. Every component of that dish was bursting with flavour and blended so well. Both of our chicken dishes brought back memories of the dishes we had in Turks and Caicos. I mistakenly assumed that the chicken would be laid over a bed of plain rice but boy was I wrong. The rice was bursting with just as much flavour as the chicken!  Definitely will be back here again and I'm curious to try the roti next time!"}
{"text":"I would go here again and again if I lived in Toronto. Good prices, and $7 daily lunch specials. Ask about it before you order a $12 dish because the lunch special is filling and you can miss it if you don't inquire or see the sign! I went with the jerk chicken --although moist and flavorful, I would opt for a curry next time because I like sauced up food."}
{"text":"jerk chicken and curry chicken are really good"}
{"text":"This place had my favorite Caribbean food ever! Love the doubles here which are only for $2.50 each, but you get them only on Wednesdays and Thursdays. I did not get them one Wednesday when I went there before 1:00 pm. 

I love their lunch specials and as a vegetarian I love their Chana, rice and beans, steamed vegetables and Cole slaw. My son loves their Jerk Chicken! Love this place and crave their food quite a bit!"}
{"text":"Although not the cleanest establishment, their food is definitely solid which makes me come back time after time. They have $5.99 lunch special all day every day, an affordable option on campus.

Their jerk chicken is always consistent and done right - it's juicy, tender and flavourful. Their rice and peas is cooked perfectly and soaks up the sauce from the jerk chicken and their coleslaw helps cool your mouth down from the spices of the jerk chicken.

They're moving locations in July 2016 - not too far from where they are now. I would most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing boneless chicken roti! Very tasty and lots of gravy.  Service was very warm and friendly, lots of smiles :). I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Tasty's is a no-nonsense Caribbean takeout spot on College that I can see has many fans of its homestyle cooking. Don't expect table service as this is a styrofoam takeout container type of fast food joint, but with a homey family run atmosphere. 
I ordered the bone-in chicken roti and it was fabulous! The wrap was gooey-oooey chewy delicious and the chicken inside was tasty too. Nice warm curry with some typical Carib hot sauce to spice it up just right. The portion was generous as you would expect for the price offering excellent value.
Great spot to know about in the area as an alternative to typical fast food or pub grub."}
{"text":"MY TO-GO PLACE FOR CARIBBEAN OR ANY LUNCH DATE. The chicken is always really delicious - super moist and the jerk seasoning is spot on. I also love their hot sauces. The only weird thing about this place is the staff - really hit or miss. But DELICIOUS food. Their third location just recently opened and I'm super happy about that because this place is just super TASTY."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick takeout meal, and perfect for students to grab lunch here. Lunch combo is around $7, and you can get a fair portion of jerk chicken, rice and veggies. Most importantly, I can attest that the chicken really IS \"tasty\"!"}
{"text":"Tasty and simple! Lunch special $6: jerk chicken with rice and peas, coleslaw (it's spicy as is!)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! The jerk chicken is just so good. The lunch special at $4.99 ($5.64 with tax) is incredible value. I usually get the jerk chicken with rice and peas and coleslaw. The curry chicken is really good too."}
{"text":"They opened last Friday. When I was ordering my food around 1pm I overheard a staff person say they were running out of jerk chicken. 

It tasted ok, not too spicy which I appreciate. Quality was ok. Quantity was adequate. Price $8.05 + tax = $9.05 a lot considering it didn't knock my socks off! 

For the walk over there I could eat in Kensington Market for about the same price or less."}
{"text":"March 2016- EDIT: DAMNIT- I found a Hair in my food but the chicken is so FREAKING good that I just picked it out and kept shoving my face with jerk chicken. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?
And yes, I'd go back. 

__________________________________________________________________________________

The food is good. 5.99 gets you the standard special- but it's available all day instead of only during lunch at most places.

This place is, however, pretty dirty at times. Unwiped tables, nail clippings- yes, NAIL CLIPPINGS on the tables....

That being said, I did order AFTER I saw nail clippings on the dirty tables and still thought the food was good."}
{"text":"Very friendly and hard working staff and this place has awesome daily special prices that has vegan options. I went with the veg special. This rice and peas, potatoes and Chana were okay, but this place is good if you're hungry and want a cheap and fast meal that'll fill you up in no time."}
{"text":"This is a great place to check out Caribbean food. The prices are amazing and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"First time trying jerk chicken, simply said it was good, worth trying it. Curry goat plate was good too."}
{"text":"Very friendly family-run roti place with a good community feeling.  There is also an artisanal cupcake vendor sharing the space."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and I always come back because the food here is a great example of homestyle comfort food. 

-Price is very reasonable, you can get a lunch for $5.99 wich includes the jerk chicken, a coleslaw and rice. The flavours are very delicious and spicy, but you can also get non-spicy.
-I tried doubles here for the first time, and loved them
-Beef patties are also very tasty (no pun intended)
-Everything seems to be done with care 
-The atmosphere is small, so if you're coming as a big group, you may not all fit. I usually just get takeout from here
-Decor is really simple, not much going on with it. 
-Staff are friendly
-Quick service
-Great place for a quick lunch or dinner, or takeout at a great price, which is why I always come back here"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick and cheap lunch, ordered the veggie meal which consisted of a large portion of rice, channa, and vegetables. Everything tasted amazing at the first bite, and surprisingly so. Even the vegetables had a strangely alluring taste, which I was happy about. 

Not long after, however, I got very thirsty, so I suspect the use of MSG which is disappointing. Pretty good bang for your buck but I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good stuff. 10/10 would come again 

Meat was tender and filling and they had a good selection of sauces. Good price, good eats, and left pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"So good. The jerk chicken is definitely spicy enough, but the coleslaw is a perfect match to cool it all down. Combine it all with the rice and 'peas' (actually red beans) and you just can't fail!!"}
{"text":"I have not a single bad thing to say about this place except for that they don't take American Express. Lol. The prices are awesome, food is INCREDIBLE and they have BONELESS GOAT! Like, they devoted their time to debone goat! TAKE MY MONEY NOW! Lol. The slices were rice, my sinuses were clear once my meal was finished and with the Caribbean music playing, I really felt like I was eating authentic food. I love this place and you will definitely see me here again!"}
{"text":"The best Caribbean food I've had by far.
I've had their jerk chicken special and boneless chicken curry roti on 2 separate occasions.
It's really close to campus and it's take out which is convenient and the prices are INSANE! The jerk chicken lunch combo was around 5.50 INCLUDING TAX. Perfect portion size for a lunch. Included rice & peas & coleslaw. 
The jerk was amazing. The spicy kick hits you when you're about halfway through but damn, it's just so good. I usually can't even handle too much spice but it was just so flavorful that I forced myself to keep going. Coleslaw was soo good and helped soften the spice but I wish they put more! I'll probably get it as a side next time. All in all, 5/5 especially if you love spicy food. 

Boneless chicken curry roti- they do their chicken roti boneless or regular, curry or jerk. So lots of options. Sooo good. Huge portion though! Had to split it with a friend. But definitely perfect. They also ask if you want to up the spice level (which i wisely chose not to do this time haha) 

Service is always friendly too :) 

Fast becoming my go to spot on campus!
Also as a side note - they have a wide vegetarian selection which I haven't tried but probably will soon."}
{"text":"Ordered on uber, had the Jerk and curry Chicken Roti. The jerk was my favourite. The spices were incredible."}
{"text":"$5.99 lunch special is probably unbeatable for the nearby university area. You can choose a meat (bbq chicken, jerk chicken, beef, etc.), either rice or rice and peas and salad/coleslaw. Very quick service (5 minutes at most).  Only thing is that their \"salad\" is quite sad, with a few pieces of lettuce, cucumber and carrots; so, don't have high expectations for that.

Their normal prices are still very reasonable at around $10 for a regular meal, which comes in the larger take-out containers. Staff are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Best lunch deal in the U of T area ($5.99 for 1/4 chicken, rice and veggies). Jerk chicken is spiced just right and the coleslaw is amazing. Great lunch spot with fast service. Definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing first-time experience here today. The lady working the cash was so sweet and pleasant, and when my friend and I tried to order something as separate entities, she very helpfully explained how we could order all the things we wanted as specials and thus save money. The place was busy and had a lively atmosphere, but we still got a table. It's a takeout place, so the atmosphere isn't gorgeous or anything, but it's a nice, sun-filled restaurant and a good vibe.
The food was very tasty. The 'veg' component of the special was a bit disappointing (it was more like a cabbage salad), but the channa was delicious as was the chicken. The rice with gravy was done well, a classic Caribbean staple. Afterward, we got dessert at the little cupcake table in there, which was yummy!
The prices were great at this place. Overall, it's a great, affordable place to grab a quick lunch or to chill for awhile. Also they do takeout, of course.
  I definitely recommend this place, and I will go back (as soon as I can!)."}
{"text":"The food choices near the UofT campus is lacking to say the least, but boy is this place a diamond in the rough.

This has been my go to place for lunch ever since I discovered it. The $5.00 (+Tax) lunch specials are godsend when you're on a student budget. The portion sizes aren't the largest, but the food is delicious, especially the jerk chicken. If I'm extra hungry, I splurge a little and get the roti, which only costs a few more dollars, and it has not yet disappointed.

Little tip, if you can hold out til 3pm, they have a dinner special, which is the exact same thing as the lunch but a bit less than twice amount of food for only a dollar more.

TL;DR cheap, delicious food near campus. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place and today we did.

Not too impressed with what we got.  We got the boneless chicken large which was $12 plus taxes.  This is the first time I've ordered jerk chicken, other times it's just been there and I ate it.

So the difference between the boneless and the regular jerk chicken is they debone it.  It's still dark meat, which in hindsight I should have gone with the regular since it was cheaper.  Cause there was bone when we ate it.

My main complaint is the sauce the lady put on it.  I guess most people, the sauce is the most important part but for us I found it too sweet and spicy.  It was difficult to eat because I try to cut down sugar so the fact that the chicken was sweet and the sauce overpowered things I wasn't a fan.

Next time, I'll get the sauce on the side and try the chicken leg or roti."}
{"text":"Very nice foods& lunch special & great portion !! And the staffs are friendly always. Unlike those chinatown restaurants, they are welcoming customers. Foods are little too salty however great foods ! :)"}
{"text":"I'm a loyal fan of Ritz until I gave Tasty's a try due to its convenient location. I was not disappointed-- the lunch special is $4.99, and you get a decent amount of rice, chicken and coleslaw.

The chicken is juicy and soft, and the jerk sauce is amazing! Cooked to perfection. I've been back for dinner special as well, and it does not disappoint. Fast service for quick take-outs.

Will return soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch joints in the city. Affordable, tasty and filling! It's 20 mins from my work and I still try to make the trek whenever I'm craving Jamaican food for lunch.  There are Ritz's closer to me but I have enough sense to not waste my money on that."}
{"text":"This place saved me when my food plan ran out last year. Do not let the pictures of the 5.99 meal deceive you, it is a very generous portion. I always get jerk chicken, rice and peas, and coleslaw. They have always been good but I swear the food is even better after the move. The meat just falls off the bone. Also, the people on cash are always super friendly. Best food for your dollar on campus! 

Edit: I am vegetarian now so I order the channa option. It is hard to find affordable, filling, and delicious vegan food, but the channa lunch special hits all the marks!"}
{"text":"I am surprised to see that this great restaurant has so few reviews! I wouldn't say that it is the best Carribean food I have had so far. Because I had better ones in Brooklyn, NY. But Tasty's food are delicious for sure. And their rice and beans are the best I have tasted so far.For under $10, you get a good amount of delicious curry goat or jerk chicken. Their ox tail stews are a little pricey. But it's definitely worth a try. I have been eating here two days in a row. Will come back for sure!

Bonus points:  
1) You can be reassured that their food was prepared in an extremely clean environment. 2) The owner Rick and his wife are very friendly. 
3) Very strong wifi signals. 
4) Good music."}
{"text":"Walked over from College Station, looking for a quite bite to eat and Caribbean sounded good. I had the lunch special (jerk chicken, rice and peas, veg) while my fiance had the boneless chicken roti. Both very delicious, the name of the restaurant is very fitting. I usually don't like jerk chicken because even though the spices are good, the chicken is normally dry. Not this place! The jerk chicken was moist, seasoned well, and the jerk seasonings were good with a bit of a kick. The rice and peas were cooked well, tasted like they added cinnamon which is a strange combination for me but overall, for $5.99 lunch special, a good and tasty deal. The boneless chicken curry roti was heavy, not wrapped well, but the flavours were delicious. The curry had strong Caribbean flavours, the potatoes, chickpeas and chicken were cooked well. Again, moist chicken. We were both stuffed, despite the lunch special not being a big portion. I'd say the roti was large though. A good lunch place. I'd definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I'm a little conflicted writing this review. I enjoyed my meal, but I found quite a bit of room for slight improvements that would've made things far better. I opted for the boneless goat roti, jerk chicken quarter, portion of chana and their in-house pepper sauce. This chicken was delicious, with a nice smokiness and a pleasantly spicy seasoning. Skin was a little soggy and didn't have the char or crispiness I really look for in a good jerk chicken. What I was really looking forward to was the roti and channa. The roti shell was light, flaky and delicious. The dhalpuri was super aromatic and complimented the curry goat perfectly. My only quam was the goat was quite gristly. I find the best curries usually have tender meat that falls apart from the extended cooking, but this just fell a little short for me. I was also disappointed the chana was a little soupy and lacked the intense flavours I was hoping for. One thing you can't miss is their pepper sauce though. I wouldn't completely dismiss Tasty's, but definitely didn't blow my socks off."}
{"text":"The dinner special here has saved my tired butt at the end of a long day many a time. Jacqueline and her husband are awesome. Every time I come in with my son Jacqueline gives him a treat (to the point that every time we ride past there - which is every day, since it's on our way home from daycare - he points to the restaurant and says \"Wanna go see the lady!!\") Besides that, the food is really yummy and and great value - The jerk chicken is the perfect level of spicy and always moist and the doubles are delish. You don't get a whole lot of coleslaw with the specials (I'm a big slaw fan) but at these prices you can afford to order an extra side of it. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"5.99 lunch special. 
I got - fried chicken, bbq rice & veg
Mom got- jerk chicken, rice& peas, coleslaw

Moms first time having jerk chicken and I'm glad it was here!!!! Authentic && delicious."}
{"text":"Tastys carribean is hidden in the middle of Spadina, surrounded by  lots of chinese restaurants. This place is so incredibly delicious. The cook there definitely knows what they're doing. Everything is perfectly seasoned and well cooked. Best carribean food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Hubby actually found Tasty's while walking the dog one night and texted to ask if I wanted to try it, to which I texted back \"GIMME, GIMME CHICKEN ROTI!\"

So hubby picked up a chicken Roti for me that was HUGE about 9 x 6 x 3 inches!!!

I was crestfallen though as my huge roti was more filler than anything.  Mushy stewy and chick pea infused vs chicken-ey, plus it was supposed to be boneless but I caught about two or three bites that had shards of bone :(  also the roti shell was tissue thin and was sticking big time to the wax paper wrapping.

The one good thing though was that there is enough roti for two meals (well for me anyway) and for some reason it tasted way better the day after as heated leftovers, and with the careful use of a fork and knife to fish out the bone bits.

I'll give Tasty's 2.5 for now, I may have to go back to try the jerk chicken or Trini double though, so for now TBC....

P.s. This location does not have a telephone # listed so it's probs best to contact via website."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but their prices and portions are bad. The staff always has a tremendously bad attitude and its usually so off putting I go somewhere else. 

It gets busy here around lunch so I would recommend going after peak hours"}
{"text":"I finally dropped in here the other month after my brother had been singing their praises for quite some time (prior to their recent move). Not wanting to go all-in at first, I stuck with their cheapest option, the $5.99 jerk chicken special (also available in curry and bbq chicken, as well as a veg option), which includes your choice of rice and vegetable side. The chicken was perfectly cooked, moist (unlike other places in the area with dried out chicken - I'm looking at you AF1) and flavourful, with the perfect amount of heat. For the price the amount of meat was considerable. The jerk sauce is on the sweet side, which seems to be the most common version in Toronto these days, but still packs a little punch. The ample amount of sauce let's it soak into the rice and peas below, giving it an extra boost of flavour. I've since returned a couple of times and it's been just as good every time. I'll have to give some of their other options a try soon. Save for a couple take-out customers, it's been absolutely empty every time I've been in, so there was not much in the way of ambience, but the place has been immaculately clean on all occasions. The staff are super friendly as well, especially the owner, who seems to like to chat it up with the customers."}
{"text":"After arriving in Toronto, we headed directly to Tasty's Caribbean Restaurant. The jerk chicken plate is delicious, generous, and served with rice, beans and cole slaw.  The wait staff is friendly and are always helpful and the new location was easy to find. A must for authentic Caribbean food. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect to conclude the end of a day trip to Toronto with my dad. My dad and I both got the bone-in chicken roti, and if we didn't know we were in Toronto, we'd have thought we were in Trinidad. It could have only been better if they had sorrel, but it's certainly not worth bringing them down a star for that! If I ever am back in Toronto, I'll probably try their fry bakes, and maybe move on from there, time and appetite permitting. 

(Yelp in Toronto is hard to navigate - conflicting reviews dominate all the top restaurants without a filter on, to the point where I spent an hour browsing for a place that didn't say both \"this is way better than x place down the street, the food is perfectly seasoned\" and \"better eat at x place down the street, this place has the worst seasoning on the food\". Blech. I had to turn on the \"cheap\" filter on Yelp to find this place. All the ratings in this category seem more genuine. Are expensive restaurants gaming Yelp in Toronto?)"}
{"text":"I am not from this area and was just driving through feeling hungry and craving Roti. The store front looks nice and colorful and their sign catches your attention easily, but when you walk in it looks actually pretty sad. The store is very bare and there are no decorations. Being a little bit concerned about the quality of their food I pulled out my phone and started loading up Yelp. Their hotbar reminded me a bit of a nursing home cafeteria, you couldn't see any of the food it was all covered up in this stainless steal containers. The soft drink frideges were completley empty and you had one box lying somehwere on the floor in there with a couple of cans in it. Honestly it looked like the place just got robbed and someone cleaned it out. 
Then I suddenly see two stars on Yelp and I wanted to run for the hills but the staff already came out from the kitchen and asked me for my order. I felt bad for the place and I thought that I can risk my $9.- for a Chicken Roti, what I disliked the most about the previous review was the chicken bones found in the boneless chicken. So the lady must have thought that I was crazy but I repeated myself like 5 times that I don't want chicken bones in my roti. 
She brought the roti bread ( chapati ) from the kitchen and it looked so fresh and fluffy, my spirits got lifted. Then she opened one of the stainless steal containers and there was the steaming concoction with the potatoes ( my favourite part ), it looked also fresh and delicious...there was hope!! Then she opened the container and I repeated myself once more, please no bones. At that point she just gave me a look like *are you serious* :) 

She wrapped in this thin parchment paper and put it into a styrophone box which I think was the only downside from the entire Roti. Because as I was eating it while driving the whole thing was kind of falling apart on me. So definitly take a fork and knife with you if you are eating it on the way. If they would have wrapped it into that sturdy aluminum foil the Roti would have been perfect. Everything was fresh, the potatoes had the perfect consistency, not to hard not to soft. Chicken had NO bones!! Yay! :) 

Not that I will every be back in that area but if I would and I would be craving a Roti I would come back to this place..."}
{"text":"I love Tasty's. My mom loves it too.. specially their jerk chicken!! Every year when she visits me during the summer, she makes sure we have a meal there!! This time I could take my dad to Tasty's too.. N they just got a new fan :D
Stay awesome as always :)"}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken special and it was good. Meat fell off the bone. They prepare it for 24 hours so lots of love out in. Had the medium sauce for a bit of a chilli kick."}
