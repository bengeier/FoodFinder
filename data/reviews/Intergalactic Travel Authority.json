{"text":"Yummy coffee in an original setting... You can make figures with play-doh, and write messages... take a picture in an intergalactic travel machine, and check the next flights to Uranus. They have some cookies, and treats too. A lovely place to hang out."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have a coffee and some good cookies. The place is maybe a bit to small. But the environment is so great! You cannot miss it!"}
{"text":"Ever since I worked near Sense Appeal I've been collecting a list of places in Toronto that serve Really Good Lattes -- great beans, freshly roasted, well-brewed and paired with perfectly steamed milk. I'm thrilled to add Intergalactic Travel Authority to my list.  I also had a cheese croissant which was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Just stopping in here for the first time, cool little place! Small cafe with a decent array or coffee/tea offerings (I ordered cranberry breakfast) and some food (got some sort of spinach/cream cheese pastry). Both yummy, the girl behind the counter was super friendly. All coffees and teas are priced the same regardless of size, soy/almond milk is at no extra charge and it seems like they'd be okay with people hanging out for a bit. :)   Additionally, all proceeds go towards the workshops that they run for kids (most of which are free) which is pretty cool in my books."}
{"text":"The Intergalactic Travel Authority is easily the best place in Bloordale to prep for your next trip to Neptune over a latte or at least catch up on the latest on the Mars rover.  Much like the Superhero Supply Co. in Brooklyn, ITA is the super fun-themed front for Story Planet, a non-profit children's literacy group that operates through the cafe's portal and was inspired by Dave Eggers' 826 National foundation.  The cafe is run by volunteers to raise money for their important work that happens in back. It's been open for about a month now, but I was only able to pop in recently because they close pretty early, at 4pm everyday(closed Sunday).   They serve Alternative Grounds coffee and at reasonable prices too. $2 for a large iced coffee.I love the woodwork in this place. The detail is impressive and they've managed to pull off the spacey feel nicely without it feeling like a Trekkie's fantasy.   You can tell a lot of care went into the making of ITA, which is in stark contrast to some of the other dive cafes in that area that have popped up in recent years(you know, half-broken vintage furniture, plywood bars and countertops with all the allure of sandpaper...). This place is a breath of fresh air by comparison!  They also sell merchandise, like t-shirts, boardgames and other novelties. It's not a huge place but it's unique and I look forward to nerding out here in the future, for the kids, ya know?"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this little gem while exploring Toronto a few months ago. It's so enjoyable that I recommend all my friends to go there while visiting and I'm writing a review for it months later.  It's a themed cafe set in the style of a futuristic space port... and it's very well done. They have fantastic baked goods and their coffee is very well made by a passionate and friendly barista who set up everything herself. The drink names all have a fun space-theme to them and they have many space-themed souvenirs as well. All the proceeds go to after-school reading workshops for kids that happen in the back (which were going on while I was there).  So if you're looking for a coffee shop in Toronto or just a unique place to stop in for a brief respite, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Each time I've passed by The Intergalactic Travel Authority (ITA), my curiosity has received a big ole jolt.   Until recently, I've never seen it open (they have short hours). So for the longest time I thought it was a travel agency, and thought the inclusion of the word Intergalactic in their name, was just hipster hyperbole. It also doesn't help that their acronym, ITA, is similar to IATA which is the International Air Transport Agency. I do not know why I know what IATA stands for.  ITA, a cafe with a twist, has what is known as a social enterprise storefront. ITA entices you in with a really cool front to consume delicious and very reasonably priced coffee, lattes, cookies, cupcakes and purchase knick-knacks like caps, bags, books etc., the money from which goes to support creative writing programs for young 'uns. It's basically a non-profit wrapped in a cafe wrapped in pure awesomeness.  I was able to spend some time chatting with the staff  about their writing programs, and the difficulty of running a non profit in these times. The barista I spoke with was very passionate about the ITA and she was skilled! My spiced chai latte was very well done: a nice tea blend combined with well steamed milk and honey. Not too sweet and very smooth: just how I like it.  During my brief stop over I noticed the great attention to detail that has gone into the cosy interiors. They've got lookalike alien characters from Monster's Inc/Despicable Me dotting the place, and at the entrance, there are  three toed alien foot prints embossed on the concrete!   I am not much of a caffeinated beverage drinker but giving me a chance to indulge in some intergalactic travels a la H2G2 while drinking coffee is an offer I can't pass on. I think I might have just found my favorite cafe in the city."}
{"text":"Came here when they hosted a charity colouring night. Whilst I give A for effort to the team and volunteers for putting their time and effort in, the food and drinks were mediocre. Although I do have to give credit to the girl who made my coffee, she tried to make an awesome coffee art heart being Valentine's day.  Since it's all for charity, hence I'd hate to scrutinize every bit of detail. It is a great place if you're looking to volunteer your time as it's a non - profit place helping to mentor the children in need. People were nice and friendly, although the colouring portion was something that could be done virtually any other location and the colouring pencils supplied were not the best."}
{"text":"Free wifi and decent coffee makes this a decent stop if you're in the neighborhood.  Kudos to them for having a non-profit running in the back, however, coffee selection is pretty weak and the coffee itself was a bit on the old side.  Other than that, they have a good theme and a clean cafe, so it's not all bad, but definitely not my first pick and no vegan treats for the non-meaty."}
