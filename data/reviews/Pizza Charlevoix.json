{"text":"I was staying on Rue Charlevoix over Memorial Day weekend (2014). I originally went to this location because I arrived late Friday night so I was looking for a quick bite. It was a pleasant surprise to find out that the owners are Bengali. I walked in with about 10 left till closing and the server never rushed me or made me feel bad that I placed a late order. They took their time unlike chicken shacks in NJ/NYC and the meat was actually juicy, unlike that frozen cardboard material. The prepared everything to perfection and also gave me enough mayo, kethcup and hot sauce. I highly recommend the double fromage cheeseburger and their poutines. Oh, it is also halal for any of my fellow Muslims."}
{"text":"Placed an order for a cheezeburger, fries and gravy, a coke and a root beer.  75 minutes later it finally arrived (they are at 5 minutes drive from my place), only to find out that they gave me a regular fries instead, and 2 cokes and a root beer (I guess to compensate), without saying anything, and everything was stone cold and the meat and cheese had started to dry out. I'm not a picky client, I know that when ordering your food will not be hot. I'm ok with even warmish food, but this was below lukewarm. I don't know about them, but I don't eat stone cold burgers.  After complaining they offered to send me fries and gravy, but they refused to do anything about the cold burger (basically a tough luck buddy, shove it in the microwave for all we care, we got your money already).  If at least the food was good, but no. The fries are clearly done in the same fryer as the chicken (battered fries are not good), and the burger's meat is really not great.  Nope, never again"}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a quick slice before meeting a friend on a cold and windy Sunday morning.  They already had at least three kinds of slices available. I chose the all-dressed Montreal style.  It was fresh, soft, and tasty. Much better than even some Italian outlets.  Friendly guys even tho I placed a cheap order.  Not as cheap as my corner spot, but excellent value for money."}
