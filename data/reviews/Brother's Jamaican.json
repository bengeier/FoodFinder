{"text":"So glad to find a yummy jamaican place in Newmarket. Ordered jerk chicken dinner ($12 medium) with came with rice and peas, a plantain banana slice, and supposed to come with salad but the lady forgot it. However, the jerk chicken and rice was so flavourful I quickly forgot about the salad.  Very clean seating area. Friendly service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken plate was tasty and portion was large.. Nice local spot for some Jamaican..."}
{"text":"Amazing. Simply the best I've had outside of Jamaica. Jerk chicken with rice and peas is my favourite. Definitely worth the drive!'"}
{"text":"My first time to Brothers Jamaican and  went with jerk chicken as their test.   Nothing says Jamaica like jerk.    Chicken was a little bony / small portion but otherwise tasty.   I went with a. medium spice which gave a mild kick.  Will defiantly go hot next time.  If it wasn't for the bony chicken, this would have been a solid 4/5.   The brown sauce on the rice with beans was flavourful and the coleslaw I chose as my side added a nice acidic balance the meal.  As a treat, there were fried plantains  to finish off the order.     The restaurant was clean and the staff super friendly.  All in all I will be going back and try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Jamaican food I've found in YORK REGION. Unfortunately they are inconsistent with their hours.   Rating for the food would be a 5 star   The service is great but I find this establishment to be unreliable when they don't follow their scheduled hours"}
{"text":"Came here to try the food after a recommendation from a coworker. I love the food and the really nice service I received here from the staff. I absolutely love their oxtail. I haven't had some this good in a while. The fried chicken was good too. A bit pricey for the amount but tasted good. Jerk chicken is good too, but next time I will ask for more gravy on the rice. The service really top notch. I told them of my food allergy and they asked me several questions to ensure the completely understood the allergy. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"We shared a jerk chicken dish. For $16, we got a large, which was a half a chicken, with rice and beans and coleslaw. The chicken was very tasty, not crazy spicy. I liked the rice and beans too. My one gripe, other than the price, is that the food could have been a bit hotter, temperature-wise.   The restaurant had some nice decorations and was very clean. The people there, probably the owners, were very sweet. They gave me the wrong sauce, and apologized 4 or 5 times.  I'd go again, but I'd ask for the food to be hotter."}
{"text":"Foods great here but I've been there 3 times now when they are scheduled to be open but are not.. They may wanna invest in an alarm clock."}
{"text":"To be honest.... the curry chicken barely has curry flavour. Instead I taste turmeric. It was pretty dry as well. The patties are great! But they are outsourced (Allan's patties) and the macaroni pie was good too."}
{"text":"Mom and I decided to come here for take out after a nail date. The menu is pretty straight forward. So we ordered a small jerk chicken meal, small ox tail meal and a couple beef patties. The food came out at a reasonable time and packed up in plastic containers.  Small Jerk Chicken meal $12 - jerk chicken, rice and peas, mac and cheese and plantain The chicken was flavourful! Delicious I must say. Rice and peas were exactly what you think it would taste like - bland. The mac and cheese was kraft dinner and two small plantain pieces..  Small Ox Tail meal  $13 - ox tail, rice and peas, coleslaw and plantain  The ox tail pieces looked like left overs, small and boney. The coleslaw was not seasoned and the plantain kinda blended in with the ox tail so we didn't think there was any.  The beef patties are outsourced by Allan's Bakery (Don Mills and Finch) I absolutely love it there. HOWEVER $2.00 for one patty kills be when I can just go to Allan's and for $3.00 I can get a patty / coco bread AND a drink.   Anyway, would I go back? Maybe but everything is well overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"I ate at Brother's in NewMarket shortly after it opened. Everything was top-notch. Oxtail, macaroni pie (not kraft dinner) & plantain were delicious and they served generous portions.  A few months later I drove 100 km to Brother's because I was craving the same delicious meal. Needless to say I came away disappointed.  They opened later than the posted time of noon (which, according to other patrons, is a frequent occurrence). We waited 1.5 hrs for our meal (usual wait times at this type of establishment is 10-15 mins). the previous generous portions were substantially reduced but the price remained unchanged (a \"large\" portion looked like what used to be a \"small/med\" portion). Note: Their oxtail dish is significantly more expensive that other Caribbean restaurants. There was no macaroni pie (which is supposed to be part of the oxtail meal). Instead, I was offered coleslaw. The coleslaw was  very, very sour and therefore inedible. They placed hot food in a plastic take out container. By the time I got my food I was too hungry to walk away so I ignored that plastic. On a positive note,  altho the oxtail didn't taste anything like \"Jamaican oxtail\" it was ok in and of itself. The food was piping hot. The waiter was also the cashier and was a very pleasant fellow. This gentleman is also the one who cooked our meal when the restaurant first opened. Perhaps he should've been cooking instead..."}
