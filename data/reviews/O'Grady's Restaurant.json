{"text":"Been here a bunch of times. Great bar and patio.... day and night, also always entertaining. The food unfortunately sucks and the service mediocre at best if you're eye candy. Ahi Tuna salad is particularly tasteless. Great tasting beer, but gotta give that to the beer makers. Pick your shit up."}
{"text":"Went here twice and was met by terrible service both times by the same waiter. Ever since we came in he was impatient and rude as if we were an eyesore. When it came to pay the bill, it came together so me and my friends were trying to calculate the per person price while the waiter was waiting impatiently. My sister was the last one to pay and she noticed an unknown $8 drink on the receipt that noone remembered buying (looking back now, it was probably the drink she \"won\" during dirty bingo). The waiter was extremely impatient so she paid for it anyways and didnt tip because she was already paying extra. I have never seen a grown man throw such a hissy fit. He stomped around loudly and cleaned the table by banging cutlery together and sarcastically borderline yelling  \"so great having you, so great serving you, oh do come again.\" The man the other people referred to as the owner (not sure if he actually was) was staring us down from the back. My sister and I did not feel safe and bolted out of there. Never coming back again. Shame because we enjoyed the bingo."}
{"text":"Zero customer service. Security guard was overly aggressive and absolutely rude about my friend not having her ID even though she wasn't drinking. We had friends with us from out of town - totally embarrassed by the treatment."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and had an awful experience every time. The servers are snooty and rude, which is the last thing you expect in the usually welcoming and cheerful church st area. The food is really poor as well. Drinks are the same thing you get everywhere else. At the end of the day, my poor review is due to the service. I don't think I've ever encountered such a rude staff before. They treat customers like theyre doing them a huge favour to serve them and most of the time they are just plain rude. There are so many lovely and fun places along church st and just over on yonge and this place is just horrible. I wouldnt go here even if it was the only bar open in the area."}
{"text":"A doorman wouldn't let my 35 year old husband in as he had no ID. I had mine that showed I am 31, but he still wouldn't budge and was rude. Common sense wouldn't go a miss when you're running a business. We then walked straight across the road to one of its rival bars and had no problem. Definitely won't be back to O'Grady's."}
{"text":"The only thing I could do to make this meal palatable was to purchase more beer to wash it down.   You don't expect a lot at a pub,  but you certainly expect better than this. The pulled pork sandwich was like something a college student who's never cooked for him/herself would throw together while experimenting. It was tart, salty and mushy. The Buffalo chicken wrap had a sauce reminiscent of canned gravy.  All this and it was very expensive for pub food. I don't advise."}
{"text":"I live right behind O'gradys, so often when the \"I wanna drink beer on a patio but not walk far\" urge hits, that's where we end up. And every time I wonder why I went there again. It's not baad...ok for a nightcap but the service is painful. The food's nothing to write home about, and the prices aren't all that great. And yet I always end up there. So I'll give them 2 stars for convenience."}
{"text":"The service here is super friendly, and the place and menu look great since the renovation. The finger foods, like the sweet potato fries and especially the giant O rings are my favourite. The other food on the menu is OK, but it's mainly pub-style food. It's a great place for socializing and meeting friends."}
{"text":"I believe they intended to be a Irish pub but they only did that partially. The service was descent but slow... Anyway, the beer they served were very cold and all I need under a 30 degree afternoon."}
{"text":"I am writing a review for different reasons on this pub. Most refer to it because of patio and pub, however today I went there for first time in a long time and tried their Brunch.  What a welcoming surprise  Firstly: really big Brunch menu with variety of choices from hearty to healthy to sweet to southern  Secondly: food tasted great.  Thirdly: Good price and good portions  Service: slightly understaffed as it seems Brunch becoming more popular, but the server was really nice and food came timely. Gave 20% tip  Really reco this place for Brunch."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I expected to.  Businesses in the village seem to exude welcome and attention to detail.  Sadly, it just wasn't to be.   O'Grady's reminds me of a spoiled trust-fund-baby.   You know the type, right?    Tons of potential but little drive?  Plenty of opportunities but no motivation to make the most of them?  Outside: perfect corner location, great building, appealing & spacious sidewalk patio.    Inside:  lackadaisical service, sloppy mistakes from the kitchen and food that's mediocre at best.   We visited on a Saturday night around 9pm.  It was moderately busy, but there were plenty of empty tables.  We scanned the menu by the door and thought \"Yes. let's get some pub food on one of those outside tables\"     Just inside the front door we met a hostess who directed us to walk out the door, around the corner and speak to another host.  Now, that's not horrible, but it was missed opportunity #1.    There was an inside door open to the sidewalk just a few steps away.   Instead of asking an obviously new customer to exit the business, an observant hostess could have said, \"Is this your first time here?  Welcome!  Next time you visit, there's a convenient host station right on the sidewalk.  Follow me, I'll introduce you...\"    We walked out the door we entered and found the the second hostess ourselves.  If you're looking, it's closer to the back of the property than the front.  We met hostess #2 and were seated in the back.    Our waiter was personable but not quick to arrive.  We ordered drinks and asked about light, quick appetizers.  Our waiter offered no suggestion other than pointing us to the appropriate menu section.  (Apparently he had no problem reading under the low light underneath that umbrella.)  We asked about nachos or chicken wings.  The waiter started writing, asking about options.  He seemed eager to just get an order and frustrated by our unfamiliarity with meat, sauce and spice options.  Again, not horrible, just missed opportunities.  We ordered quickly.  Drinks arrived quickly; appetizers didn't.   Other tables seated after us were served.   Eventually a server carried our plates to another table.   Some shuffling and confused looks caught our waiter's attention. The plates came to our table.  (Did the kitchen expediter shuffle tickets?  Aren't tables numbered?  Aren't table numbers on each ticket?)     The chicken wings were hot and decently cooked while the 'loaded' nachos had been under a salamander or holding lamp so long the cheese had dried and some chip edges blackened into charcoal.  They were also missing ingredients listed for them on the menu.   Our waiter was busy with conversations at other tables.  We ate around the kitchen's mistakes and made the most of it.   After all, making a plate of tortilla chips completely inedible is practically impossible.  When our waiter eventually checked on us with a \"How's everything?\" I told him of the nacho issues.    His response was priceless:  \"So you liked the chicken wings.  Great!  What about entrees?\"   We didn't order entrees.    I don't know if O'Grady's management is absent, burned-out, in denial or ignorant, but with a little passion, some staff training and oversight, this place could live up to its potential.     Of course, I'll likely never know if O'Grady's takes my advice or not.   In the end the great location just wasn't enough to compensate for the self-satisfied attitude toward customer service and the careless food mistakes."}
{"text":"O'Grady's serves a very nice weekend brunch that includes grilled pea meal bacon in it's choices of meat and several yummy platters and omelet options.  It's a very pleasant place to linger over breakfast."}
{"text":"I guess this place is alright if you want to be scene and people watch. But other than that, you need to steer clear.  The bottles at the bar have fruit flies all in them just floating around, you know, hanging out. Also, the beer tastes awful like piss.  The wait staff were extremely entitled. Our waiter was impossible to track down as he kept talking to his friends. It was rude and very lazy. I would rather give my money to the food runners/bussers since they seem to be actually working.  Overall, the place was grimey and in some serious need of renovations. I would rather go to Churchmouse across the street."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and ordered the same thing both times (goat cheese spinach and roasted vegetable wrap).  The first time it was ok, and the second time it was totally inedible.  I've never sent food back in a restaurant in my life but this was beyond my limits.  I went home and made a peanut butter and jam sandwich instead.  The service also seems pretty inconsistent. First visit: great service, friendly server.  Second visit: slow service even though it wasn't that busy, and a server with a rude attitude.  I definitely won't be going back to eat but because they have such a huge patio and it's just down the street I'm sure I'll end up there for drinks again."}
{"text":"Descent food, usually pretty good service. Love the outdoor space in the summer! We frequently drop by for a drink and bring friends when they visit town."}
{"text":"Slightly subpar food and a server who's only interest seemed bringing up our tab, upselling is on coffee with Bailey's, then charging an additional 3 for a coffee refill, plus an extra 3 dollars for salad instead of fries. It wouldn't have been an issue if she had told me any of it in advance. She also tried to shame the guy I was sitting with when she ran into him. There are so many better places in this city for the same price."}
{"text":"Great patio! Both times I have been, I have gone to the patio, with the entrance around the side. (FYI- cash and credit only!) The menu is fairly intensive considering that it consist of bar food, and all is for a very decent price. Food is good, not amazing but no one goes to O'Gradys to have the best food they've ever had. I would recommend getting a pitcher with friends- for summer, they have white and red sangria. All the waiters I have had there have been friendly and helpful. Located on Church in the gay district, the atmosphere is relaxed, fun, and good for groups.   + points for an awesome atmosphere and consistently good sangria.  - points for food (okay, but not amazing) and cash/credit only.  I will for sure go again!"}
{"text":"Public health orders a Hepatitis clinic because a staff member  has hepatitis A"}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service as it was packed due to the beautiful sunny Friday. Mac and Cheese Squares ($12.00) with bacon and avocado was truly amazing and delish. Martinis are flavourful and fragrant (Elderflower).  Great atmosphere, fantastic staff."}
{"text":"Mediocre brunch for like, $10. The scrambled eggs that came with the two egg breakfast were dry and lukewarm when I got them. The potato home fries were at least real cuts with skin. Few or little vegetarian options. The patio environment's not bad and it was nice of servers to offer plush green pillows for us to lean on while eating breakfast on a weekday. The coffee tasted kind of sour. Id come here for the ambience but not the food."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of the best patios in the area and has recently been updated with new tables, benches and chairs to replace the plastic lawn furniture that was here before. I have a feeling this is due to the increased competition in the area with the Firkin having recently renovated and The Garage re-opening before the Summer.  The service is usually pretty fast here, and if you stick to bottled beer you can't go far wrong. For whatever reason, I feel awful the next day after a pint or two of draught beer at this place.  Regarding the food, it's standard pub fare and nothing to write home about. I was here last night with a friend who had the Cobb Salad and it looked pretty good, so maybe things are looking up on the food side too.  Summary:  Come for the patio, not the food or draught beers."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to O'Grady's for Sunday breakfast/brunch as several friends had recommended it. We were not disappointed.  I ordered the Benedict of the Day ($14) which had smooth hollandaise sauce on two soft poached eggs, pulled pork and sautéed onions on lightly toasted English muffin halves. Succulent!  Served with a side of lightly dressed mixed greens and a bit of fresh fruit. ($14)  My husband had two eggs (hard scrambled) with peameal bacon (two good-sized slices), potatoes, toast, and a bit of fresh fruit. ($9) He's a picky eater, likes plain foods, and was satisfied.  The service was casual, but very good! We had our main server, but two additional servers and the manager (or assistant manager?) helped top up my coffee.  Funny & sweet incident: For a short moment, one of the servers said the \"bad news\" was that the coffee maker was broken, so no more decaf... but the \"good news\" was \"But you are pretty.\" Turned out the coffee maker was fixed. But a \"gold star\" for gentle humour!  The weather was so beautiful, we sat out on the side patio, thought they also have a back deck, and plenty if inside seating for when the weather is inclement, including Toronto's long winter seasons!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but couldn't beat the service. Alex \"gorgeous Alex\" (as per our receipt) was extraordinarily attentive and funny. My boyfriend and I brought a couple of friends to the city and had a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been here about 50ish times and I keep going back. The potato wedges are potatoey (almost crispy on the outside, like mashed potatoes on the inside) but IMO so good. I had the veggie burger most recently and it used to be good, now it's even better. It's a quinoa hummus mixture that is delicious and I think it stands on it's own. In generally I'm impressed with the basic pub food here (a pub with decent salads OMW), but every once in a while something gets over cooked. If you eat vegetarian then I think that's less likely.  The service staff can turn over quite a bit (especially in the Summer) so expect some questions they'll have to go and figure out - they were a few years ago atrocious and now they're generally pretty good. Cheap basic breakfast before 11am on weekdays. It looks nothing like the breakfast picture on the posters, but it's a good basic breakfast."}
{"text":"Very nice place to go for drink or even for a meal. The food was great service was fantastic very friendly environment reasonable prices ."}
{"text":"Only reason this place is getting three stars is because of the fantastic patio.  If you're with a group of friends just looking to have beer or sangria they have amazing deals on 4L of beer,  it's amazing. Besides that not much to rave about.   Service was awful,  server didn't care about us and was being a arrogant dick when asking us questions.   Took a while just to get our beer so that was disappointing. Selection of beer on draft is poor. Menu selection is below mediocre. Friend ordered poutine and it looked of the quality of that at Burger King. Terrible.  If you're drunk and looking to grab simple drunk people grease food then please hit this place up. It'll hit the spot without a doubt but please don't eat there with any real expectations.   Service- 2/5 Venue -  5/5 (awesome patio!)  Food- 1/5(weakest aspect)   Experience -  3/5"}
{"text":"I love the huge patio and is great for groups of people.   The down fall is there food. The food is good but the price you pay you really dont get all that much"}
{"text":"Great spot!! Great patio / service / food. Really nice neighbourhood spot.  Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!"}
{"text":"We went to O'Grady's for the first time in about a year. Nice quaint atmosphere inside and a huge patio outdoors weather permitting.   Had the steak cooked med-rare and was cooked perfectly. They changed their French fries and now they are shoestring style which I was not a fan of. They looked like bagged French fries until I tasted them. They were nice and fluffy.   Had a Caesar here as I do at every restaurant I visit. This one was a double and kind of watery with not enough spice.   The staff is friendly and attentive.   We ordered... -two steak and frites dinners -one cider ($9 can. Pretty pricey) -one double Caesar  -pitcher of Molsen Canadian  Total was $108.00 plus tip."}
{"text":"service was great, friendly and  energy and atmosphere was great, unlike the place across the street where i asked one question about a drink and eyes were rolled at me and attitude was given. so we walked out of that bar not wanting to give them our hard earned $$ and into O'gradys and had an amazing time.  It was karaoke night- fun to watch, ordered soup and salad, was 11.99$ kind high price for what im used to- but was really good. my drinks were yummy .. and the waitress was all for answering our questions- since we are all not from toronto - and both bars were not busy - so i knew i was not holding anyone up. we where interested in learning more about the area and the waitress, was great. Kitchen is right behind the end of the table areas. its a cute tiny place. would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Plastic paddy in the village. Service is very friendly but food and booze are kinda Meh. First time some of my friends had been out in the village. This is good for a pint before plunging into the world of Cruze and Tango. Solid 2.6 stars"}
{"text":"Usual pub food of chicken strips & fries, hamburgers and sandwiches. A lengthy menu but nothing stands out. The staff are friendly and quick at getting your orders to you. It has a huge outdoor patio for the summer, which is when this restaurant is at it's best."}
{"text":"Very classy place good food great staff friendly staff great place to for a nice cold drink or grab a great meal"}
{"text":"I was visiting with my friend for the NBA All Star game from San Francisco and we wanted to watch the Grammy's at a fun spot. We randomly found this place and had so much fun here! They had tons of TVs and even a ballot (I lost - damn you Taylor Swift). The cutest part was they had cocktails named after the main talent (\"the biebs\").  I bet this place is tons of fun during sport games! The crowd was fun and the staff was very sweet, especially our waitress. Food was... Ehh. My friend has their calamari and hated it but my kale Caesar with salmon was good (but then again, how can you F that up)?!"}
{"text":"I like coming to sit on the patio here. You're always guaranteed a spot. The service is friendly and prompt and the food selection is good -- especially for vegetarians.   A hidden gem to order is the dip platter. You get three nice dips (the red pepper dip is the least delicious, but still good) and tons of pita.   I usually order cider when there, and haven't noticed a problem."}
{"text":"My 40th birthday surprise party was held here on the upper level. We had wings, nachos and finger foods and they were all great. We had our own bartender, which was awesome!  The servers kept the food coming and even sang happy birthday to me when they brought the cake out. All in all we had a great time.  I've also go there frequently during patio season. Love the patio, though depending on the server, wait times for drinks and food can be slightly long. I've never had what I would consider a bad experience there yet."}
{"text":"The neighborhood pub with a friendly and knowledgable staff. Sports, cold beer, and good food."}
{"text":"We didn't have any food but I did have a terrific drink and the folks I was with all liked their beers. The service was just great. A young woman was there every time we needed her with a smile and a joke because we were joking around too. We were shown a nice table on the porch and everything was great. This all took place on a busy Thursday night in June."}
{"text":"Great patio, but they seem to have become lazy about everything else because of their prime location in the Village.  Mediocre food at best, service is ok, but the beer selection is sadly poor and their taps are dirty with flat draft beer the result. If you have the words \"Tap and Grill\" in your name you'd think they'd at least make sure those taps are clean. Bottled beer is a more expensive option, but at least it won't be flat and gross.  In a nutshell: SIGH. C'mon guys, you can do better."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place to have  a party.  A friend of mine had a going away bash here last night. He had booked the second floor, which was pretty comfortable for the 30-40 of us. There were three high tops, two couch areas a big table and a bar area to hang out. I'm of the opinion that a good party requires several places for small groups (5 people max) to have good conversations. This place definitely provided that. We had a dedicated bar with Strongbow on tap, and a bathroom on the floor. It was a pretty ideal place to hold a party, really.  The bartender there was very nice and reasonably quick, considering he was pretty much working the whole room by himself, including bussing and serving drinks. He was also pretty easy on the eyes, which is standard for the neighbourhood.  I've been here in the summer as well, and they have a pretty stellar patio.  Will be back if I'm in the neighbourhood, or if I'm planning a party for a bunch of people!  No debit on the second floor."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a cold spring evening, nice pub with great atmosphere. Enjoyed onion rings as a starter, and ahi tuna salad for the main. Servers all were friendly and courteous, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"slighlty better than a firkin, o grady's has an excellent patio that you can waste your nights with good friends and good beer. consistenly average and good and extra points for the nice location- good for people watching."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was ok nothing bad really but just not memorable"}
{"text":"I have not been a huge fan of the food offerings at this place over the years.  That being said, last weekend a larger group of us went there for brunch.  Wow.  That changed my mind!!  The food was great, and we did not need to 'scream' at each other to hear one another.  Time to try dinner again..."}
{"text":"O'Grady's is a great place in the Village to have a relaxed hangout with friends. It is a pretty standard pub with several TVs.  The server was friendly, attentive, and always came back to refill our water.  I had the fish and chips, which had a nice, light batter and tasted great. The size of the fish is actually quite large (see the picture), so go for 2 pieces only if you're really hungry!   Others at my table had the chicken fingers and fish tacos, which they also enjoyed."}
{"text":"Such a classic, warm and friendly pub with the standard pub fare. Big portions, always fresh. A perfect relaxing place to grab breakfast, brunch, a snack, or dinner. After 5 separate visits, I have walked away nicely full and so happy. I love this place, and highly recommend their sandwiches, burgers, salads, and wings....I haven't ever had a bad experience! The staff are so professional, knowledgeable and amazing, and I feel like I'm truly taken care of. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I got the nachos from here and they were pretty good, needed more beans. My friends and I mostly came for drinking purposes however all of the drinks were ridiculously watered down, even the maker's on the rocks that my friend ordered which was damn near transparent. For the price I paid, I definitely expected better. And as we were leaving someone tried to leave with a drink and didn't know you couldn't and the bouncer caused a huuuuuuge scene about it for no reason whatsoever instead of just saying you can't leave with an open bottle of alcohol. Our waiter was a sweetheart, so the star is for him."}
{"text":"sat on the pAtio wt my bf.  server was not overly kind to begin with seemed to lAck hospitality and had a attitide problem.  quite indifferent like ge hates his job lol.   we spoke clearly maybe he had a hard time listening...  at the end of the day yhe pitcher of sangria was so low in alcohol content not even a slught buzz after drinking it all.  it was like sugar water.  definitely disapointed all around  first time there too.  wont be coming back"}
{"text":"I had dinner here and was extremely impressed by the food. It was probably one of the best meals considering quality/price ratio in Toronto. I had a chicken parm special for $14. The chicken was a giant portion, it was delicious and juicy. The spaghetti was plentiful, cooked al dente, and covered in a simple but delicious tomato sauce. The garlic bread was good, too. I literally considered ordering a second serving because it was so tasty but the first serving filled me up. My dining companion had the buffalo wrap and said the food was great too. Our servers were friendly and helpful. I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5/5 star rating.  This is just a great casual place with a great patio to grab some drinks with friends.  The service staff are friendly, fast, and can take a bit of ribbing.  (We tried having a little bit of friendly but harmless fun with our server and he took with good natured humour!)  Our group of 3 tackled the O'Grady's 148oz monster pitcher and it is clearly the best value if want to be out there chilling on the patio while sipping on some cold suds.  The menu is standard pub fare but I particularly like their fries and sweet potato fries for munching on.  This would be one of my go-to summer patio spots wen the sunshine comes around again."}
{"text":"My best friend and I initially meant to visit the Keg mansion in the same area as o'Grady's. Long story short we decided to try some other area to go to because the Keg was still closed. When we got there we saw the menu and thought it looked delicious and they even offered a brunch special. We decided to give it a shot. When we got there we were greeted fairly by the hostess who sat us down and gave us the menus. After ordering two brunch specials, we noticed how somewhat empty our plate kinda looked. We only got two pieces of bacon, one sausage and a decent amount of eggs. Usually grabbing brunch from other restaurants your plate is more full and feels like it's worth your money but here it didn't as much. Although the special was decently cheap I would have expected to get atleast a good amount of the food I've ordered. The hostess was nice but I found that the people working there were barely even there, when we needed assistance. I believe they were all gathering for some type of meeting while customers were in the restaurant, when it would be more better to be doing that when customers aren't around. Other than that It was an okay experience but I likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem when i was on the hunt for a good brunch.  Food was top-notch. A nice mix on the menu of things done their own way, and classic dishes they serve as they're known.  After brunch I ended up staying for a few beer while watching soccer and the staff were nothing but friendly and attentive.   Awesome place."}
{"text":"Large, amazing patio for drinks.  Mediocre pub food with average servers. Drink the afternoon away here and wander elsewhere for dining. Best thing on the menu are their nachos."}
{"text":"Ted served us tonight. Super attentive, and cute to look at. Best service I've had here by far."}
{"text":"O'Gradys is basically the village's version of the bar from Cheers (okay, I've never actually watched the show, but I get the jist..)   The drinks are a touch pricey, but I can't wait all day to go to crews, so I'll happily drink here before hand.  Other than that, there's nothing to write home about.  But come summertime, RELISH IN THEIR AMAZING PATIO.  The three stars are basically for that. I could sit there for hours and hours, with pitcher after pitcher of less than stellar sangria...   Notes:  1. Nothing fantastic about the food. 2. Nothing fantastic about the drinks 3. The Second Floor is awesome, chose it over the first 4. They have sex toy bingo on thursdays 5. Some sunday mornings the toronto furries like to meet here. I like to watch."}
{"text":"A decent patio with shareable nachos. A place I like to take my friends on a hot day when all you want to do is eat an appetizer and drink a cider"}
{"text":"Don't Bother For Breakfast  Showed up at 10am on a Saturday morning. They were still getting things together, didn't look like they were ready for any customers, but 2 were already eating on the patio.  It took 5 minutes for the waiter to come back and wipe a seat on the patio off for the 2 of us.  Country music was playing inside, none without.  The meal arrived. Eggs rubbery and browned on the outside. Side potatoes deep-fried, overdone. Ham was fried cold cuts, not fresh sliced ham. Coffee was undrinkable, especially painful within sight of 2 better coffee joints. Fruit side was fresh. Lot of food left over, didn't want to take any of it away. Previous couple also didn't finish their meal.  No one came with our bill for a long time. We had to hunt someone down. Paid over $20 not including tip for 2 very mediocre breakfasts.  Great location for people watching, but you'll just have to ask if they have a different fry cook for the evenings."}
{"text":"I have been going to O'Grady's for years.  After today I will not set foot in the place again.  Took a friend for lunch. She was visiting from out of town and leaving tomorrow for the west coast. She had the Cob Salad with strips of beef.  I had an omelet.  The food tasted fine and the service was good.  Unfortunately she became extremely ill about two hours after we finished our meal.  It is food poisoning and a really nasty case of it. The only meal she had all day was the lunch.  I called and spoke to the manager.  He was nice enough and said he would speak to the kitchen..blah blah blah.  Did he offer any compensation? How about a refund for her meal or a voucher for a future meal?  Nope non of that.  But did thank me for the call. What a cheap crappy establishment.  They would not even take one bit of responsibility for what happened.  Disgusting and reckless way to run a business."}
{"text":"This place would have received 5 stars as we spent around 4 hours on a pleasant evening here, however if our evening did not get ruined by a presumptuous waiter that felt the need to control our alcohol intake. First he insisted that we finish a glass of water before bringing a drink, and then told us the next drink would be our last and could not be a shot- fair enough. My go to drink is an old fashioned, and I was disgusted to a point that I had to speak to the manager about it. The drink was so watered down, and he said he was not aware of the \"cut off\" these guys or control them. Our waiter gave us all these reasons and excuses about Toronto laws and rules, but friends of ours told us that was nonsense and they never experienced that before. The people at Garage across the street seemed to have been allowed a good time and O Grady's is for the quiet and sophisticated sipper!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 45 minutes for an appetizer before being told they couldn't make it. Manager wasn't going to comp our drinks until we asked. She then said \" you know what? Fine. Happy Mother's Day\" and slapped the bill holder closed and walked away. We left and will not be returning. But on a happier note, the church mouse across the street was awesome as always!"}
{"text":"It's not a bad place.  The prices are between reasonable to pricey (depending on your point of view or budget).  The food is nothing to rave about.  It's not bad at all!  Just nothing to drool over.  The beer selection is somewhat lacking in my opinion.  Nice place....honestly, I prefer the Churchmouse & Firkin across the street.  But that could be just me.  :-/"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting friends who live in the village.  Spacious patio, with a pretty wide menu. Food was pretty good, I had the buffalo wrap and wedge fries. The wrap was so hot, burn my lips off hot!  Pop refills are an extra $1.50  Would have had a better visit if a) There wasn't a really annoying group of people next to us who were super loud and constantly shaking the patio with their dancing.  and b) if there wasn't a million bees around.  Maybe next time we'll go in the actual restaurant.   A-Ok visit."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  -Massive patio.   -Beer comes cold and crisp and there's a decent selection. Bottles are expensive ($6 for a bottle of Henieken) so stick with the pints.   -Overall, the food/atmosphere/prices etc are just 'OK,' but service is EXCELLENT. I came here twice during pride weekend, and each time servers were sweet, prompt and checked on us regularly, despite it being extremely busy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with Abbasy for a surprise birthday party. We sat upstairs and there must have been like 12-14 of us? They moved the tables for us and were really flexible about everything. Super nice service - even though it was a little slow and the girl didn't know general beer prices? Their beer selection wasn't exciting, just the usual stuff (Rickards, Organic, Heineken, etc). I had the 1L jug and it was around 11-12 bucks which is meh, ok? Not that cheap.  I ordered the burger with poutine instead of fries. The poutine comes with wedges which I didn't really enjoy, it was too potato-ey. The burger wasn't good at all - it was sooooo burnt!!! And not very hot. It doesn't come with any condiments, you put everything on yourself. I had to add cheese but it came with a LOT of onions, tomatoes, lettuce and pickles. I was pretty hungry so it went down super fast but I can't say I was all like YUUMMM!  The atmosphere is good, the upstairs was pretty quiet, as in not too many people. Downstairs was crammed.   OVERALL, good experience - I just wasn't a fan of the food at all."}
{"text":"I came here around 7:45 on a Friday evening while I was waiting for a reservation at a nearby restaurant. Although the place was busy, we had no problems finding a table for two. They have a decent selection of beer and a smaller selection of wine (maybe four types each of red and white) at around $7.50 for a glass. Service was adequate and this was a fine place to go to kill some time. I would have no issues with returning here, and it looks like they have a good patio for when the weather improves."}
{"text":"The strength of this pub is its patio which sits just on Church Street, so you can watch the village folk wandering around. Service is reliable and quick. Food is hit and miss."}
{"text":"It's a solid village pub. In fact, it pretty much is THE spot on church street to chill.   It has an extensive menu for pleasing everyone except for those with gluten free concerns. We had to leave and come back to make sure my friend could eat something. We returned after dinner for the positive atmosphere. This would be a great area to expand their menu (just throwing out there since it's becoming a more common issue).  Open late for food, drinks and just always a good time. Might I add, quite a variety of sangria pitchers are available. Highly recommend.  My two favourite food items here are the nachos - great for sharing.  The other : fish tacos.   Outside of food, yes there's loads of beer, cocktails and mocktails are available. They have that covered pretty well.   Customer service is spot on here. Generally, it's unusual to not get a good server here even when they are new!"}
{"text":"Rude wait staff, weak drinks. Fine for beers on the patio in summer but otherwise it's nothing like it used to be.  Go to Churchmouse &  Firkin across the street for stronger drinks, more selection, nicer staff, better value, all in a bar that's less of a s#!+hole."}
{"text":"Onion rings and kale caesar were good! Food comes out fast,  the wait staff can forget about you even when it's dead slow. Will return!"}
{"text":"Hmm...I almost think I need to draft a template for the standard \"Mediocre Toronto Pub\" review.  This pub has sadly made the list.    The beer selection is adequate...bit more heavy on the mainstream.  The waitress really pushed the Rickard's \"Autumn\" beer which was crap beer spiced with cinnamon and cardamom or something weird.  I was there for Canadian Thanksgiving weekend and decided to try the dinner.  I could swear that the stuffing was stovetop!  The mashed potatoes had awful presentation....I feel like I'm in a cafeteria when I see precise small scoops on my plate.  The turkey itself was disappointing and had clearly spent much of the day in a warming oven.  All im all, I think I'll skip this place.  I wonder how a pub with such poor fare can survive serving relatively expensive food and drink."}
{"text":"#SUMMERSPOT #GAYBOURHOOD #TORONTO #YELP #PRIDE  O'Grady's is a fun time. I've been here twice, once for drinks with my coworkers on a lovely summer night, and it's fantastic when the weather's that great. The place offers an amazing patio and some ridiculously cute servers girls like me can't do much about.   Food and drinks, not too great. My colleagues had beer, I had a cocktail that tasted like water. Meh. But the patio. I'd come back for the patio!"}
{"text":"Better drinks than food. Service was good but the food was left to be desired. Went for brunch and had a chewy dry meat lovers omelet."}
{"text":"Best patio dining in the Toronto Village area.  Laura was our favorite server... Definitely ask for her and all the good is really good. Try the Nachos."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and the food was good so I went back and brought a friend from out of town. We ordered the steak and frites and both steaks were over cooked. His by a little and mine by a lot. We were both really hungry and ate the steaks anyway but we complained. The server told us that he had had similar complaints recently. So if they have had similar complaints why is the issue not being fixed and why didn't they offer us some sort of a discount. I ended up paying $80. for a bad meal. The only reason we went there is because all the other patios were full and their patio wasn't and now I know why. I won't go there again."}
{"text":"The best thing that O'Grady's has going for it is its patio in the heart of the gay village.  It is a big patio and seems to be busy any evening that the weather is decent.  They have a decent-sized cocktail menu, and the prices are reasonable (but not a bargain).  Unfortunately I have found that some of the martinis are a bit dodgy.  I had one last night which was a bizarre combination of goldschlager, vodka, and another liquor that I can't recall, and it was barely drinkable.  There are some good ones though, but don't expect anything amazing.  The service is a bit hit-and-miss, but mostly adequate.  Also, I've only been here for drinks, so I can't comment on the food, but from looking at the menu, it is extremely uninspired (I didn't read it all but I'm sure there's a club sandwich on there somewhere) and is really just there to support the liquor sales.    What I've written may not sound like a 3* review, but despite it's flaws, O'Grady's truly is a fun place to go and have a few drinks on a summer evening!"}
{"text":"Love O'Grady's! One of the best patios for people-watching and enjoying better than average pub fare.  The staff are always upbeat, friendly and fast. My Falafel & Spinach burger was very tasty, I think there are a couple of other vegetarian options, will be back to try them this Summer."}
{"text":"It's a nice patio, but the food is less than spectacular, the drinks are OK, and the bathroom super annoying to get to.  I've found the service is hit or miss and it's a little pricey for what you're getting.  Alas, if you're just looking to grab a quick bite and beer it's fine."}
{"text":"The place was JAMMED as it was Pride Weekend in Toronto. We stopped here as we were looking for some beer & pub grub. Decent little place but the patio was jammed so we had to sit inside. Also had to go upstairs. The server was \"Marc\" nice fellow of Asia decent with what appeared to be an Kiwi accent.   Had chicken fingers with fries. Nothing to complaint about for food."}
{"text":"An Irish bar in the gayborhood? Sure, why not?  Met a friend here for a quick happy hour, and of course a meal.  I didn't go inside at all because I was immediately drawn toward the outdoor seating. I can imagine it's pretty vacant during those harsh winters.  Our server was nice. Told my friend he looked like one of the wait staff. We saw him- he didn't.  We got a pitcher of beer for 10 CAD  I ordered myself a Buffalo wrap and fries. The buffalo was pretty spicy. I liked the chicken and the amount of breading. The fries were ok, but I'm finding that I'm not a huge fan of Canadian fries.  The place had a cool vibe. Something for everyone. Didn't feel like a gay bar for those who don't want to hang in the midst of all the gays. I would definitively come back and hang out on the patio and throw back a few more b"}
{"text":"Even with all the 'changes', this place continues to be a hit or miss.  Food (taste) and service seem to be continued issues.  It does have a great patio and most of the servers are friendly but service is very slow even when they're not busy.  My last visit end of August, I just wanted a drink and eats before my salon appointment so I ordered my fav beer and the chicken quesadilla.  Loved my beer, H A T E D the chicken quesadilla - it was D I S G U S T I N G!!!  Who puts BBQ sauce inside a chicken quesadilla???  Although nice of the server to do, 20% off was not even close to enough. I think they KNOW how many bad reviews they get so I'm not surprised you can't post any comments on their site."}
{"text":"I got into town and my B&B nearby wasn't answering the door - thanks, guys! - so I wandered down  Church St., dragging my overstuffed bag and starving. I passed many gay bars and pizza joints, but I desperately needed a STRONG cocktail. Lo and behold, what do I see but O'Grady's, without a line or huge crowds inside on a Friday night (which I was thankful for). Got a double whiskey and perused the menu, which was a little disheartening as Kevin F. said. However, I flipped it over and discovered fish & chips, which I'm always in the mood for, despite the frying and breading. Theirs was top-notch and very English, with the extra crispiness and very light fish (cod, I think). The fries were tasty, too - big chunks of potatoes but very well-done. The tartar sauce was pretty lame, though; seemed like sweet mayo with no evidence of relish in it. The food hit the spot, and the nice barkeep told me where to go to get a hotel room (didn't pan out as they were too pricey, but it was appreciated). Found a Days Inn and spent a short 10 hours there until I could get into my B&B, finally.   Went back several days later for a glass of vino, since it was nearby. Not the greatest wine, but the karaoke was fun to watch while I drank."}
{"text":"I've been here before for nachos with a friend and they were really yummy! I was in here again this morning for breakfast. There were good tunes playing, my fav. 80's music!   There were only three seats taken in the whole place but two cooks were in the kitchen and three staff members on the floor, one was cleaning the chairs, the top of the TV sets, etc. it smelled a bit like vinegar and musty cleaning fluid.   We had our breakfast which arrived fairly quick (early bird special) which consisted of a giant plate of eggs, toast, we ordered tomatoes instead of meat and home fries. The breakfast was tasty, service was OK.  I'd definitely return for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Average, greasy pub fare and pitchers. I guess it doesn't help that I'm not into that. If you are, then you'll be satisfied here. The air smells like chlorine. I only come here because my non-foodie friends want to go here when in the area."}
{"text":"Great patio in the summer. Lots of places in the sun or in shade. judging by patio it is a 4 star. Interior is worn so only gave a 3 star but definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"One of the Restaurant we went to when visiting for Toronto World Pride..  Most of the seating is outsite on their extensive patio. Flatscreen TV's outside to watch sports! Drinks by the glass, bucket or pitcher delivered fast.. Food service was a little slow, but considering the crowd I think they did a great job.. For was good, and reasonably priced considering how busy they were and it was a holiday. Great for two people to chill on patio, or groups"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by no means bad (more of a 3.5) - the food's good, they have a wide array of drinks, and the ambiance was a very typical pub atmosphere (also, because you're on Church, the music is amazing... bop after bop!) My biggest issue was our server, who was literally the NICEST and most outgoing person in the world - but honestly was not great at serving at all. My friend ordered a coffee, and 45 minutes later he came up to us and asked my friend if he still wanted it because he forgot. We sat down and weren't served for probably 15 minutes, and then when I ordered my drink (I ordered Guinness) the wrong one came - the only reason I noticed compared to other beers is because Guinness is literally black and this was super light. The guy was really friendly and nice, and luckily me and my friend weren't really going to eat, but more to talk, but honestly if I was coming here for a meal I'd probably be more pissed. Though keep in mind I'd probably come back here, just hopefully I'd get a different server!"}
{"text":"I was there for breakfast. The serving sizes were good and the food was very good. I think the outdoor seating space made the food seem better than it was. The staff is friendly and the other diners seemed to enjoy being there. My only complaint was that the menu didn't say the meals came with a side of fruit so I ordered a some. Between the generous amount on the plate plus the bowl, I had more than I wanted plus had to pay for it. Still, I enjoyed it enough to go back to dinner 2 days later. Dinner was good but very limited menu."}
{"text":"Great place to stop, relax, eat, and drink!  Andrew was our waiter and was amazing!  It was really busy but he made us feel like we were his only guests.  He had perfect timing to refill drinks, deliver food, and follow up. He took and interest in us (being out of towners) are asked and answered questions to help us out.   The food was great and the drinks were amazing!  I personally loved the Rocket!  The patio in the evening was perfect!! Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The patio is amazing..  Everything else about O'Grady's is less than average.    In the summer relax on the patio with a drink and watch the world go by.  Unfortunately that beer be the standard bottle or basic mixed drink.  I am yet to see anything creative that would come from a mixologist.  The menu is less inspiring.  I find it hard to order something here because everything is so common and drab.  If you are looking for basic greasy pub food without a new idea in sight, then order away.  The biggest issue at O'Grady's has to be the service.  Getting a server to acknowledge you is hard, they all seem to he hanging out talking to their friends.  But paying has to be the hardest, I had to ask several times for our bill and it took over 15 minutes and the credit card machine didn't work in our area (buy a range extender).  If you are looking for a pub experience try the Churchmouse across the street, they are a definitely better in all aspects but patio."}
{"text":"Seriously, wtf was that about? Our server refused us service after one pitcher and didn't even accept our generous tip. My impression of him was homophobic, which I find to be ironic considering the geographical location. It's 2016 and I feel terrible for my friends having been subjected to this sort of treatment. Shame on him. His name is Scott btw (buff fucker with long hair). Zero stars should be an option with this app."}
{"text":"Just another typical pub place. It's got 2-floors, ground floor is more like a casual sit-down restaurant, while upstairs is more like a bar. The 2nd floor has a stage, pool tables, and a coin operated foozball table. The alcoholic drinks are pricy and I would avoid getting their Long Island Tea (it's made of pepsi, not iced tea). I tried their Fish & Chips and found the fillet tasted a tad fishy, but otherwise its size was great and the fry on it was to my liking! It came with lots of French fries and a small side of tartar sauce."}
{"text":"In my entire life, I have never seen a waiter complain about a tip upon receiving one until today. A friend visiting from Brazil wasn't clear of the tipping process in Canada. The waiter outright threw a fit. I mentioned I would explain the concept to my visiting friend to fix the problem as the service was great.  and the waiter still wouldn't have it. He said 'he should know better' Great service until the last minute When he became rude and unprofessional. Not impressed."}
