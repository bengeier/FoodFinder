{"text":"We just ate our favorite beef taco salads. My husband adds the super burrito to his order. It was very good and so was the service. The salsa bar lets you get what you want."}
{"text":"Slowest taco johns on the planet. Seriously. Figure it out. Ordered 4 tacos and we are the only ones in the drive thru. Have waited 10 minutes. Maybe get an adult on staff to keep things running smoothly."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. I found a yellow finger nail in my soft shell taco. I was eating there so I took it up to the counter to show the manager who acted as though it really wasn't a big deal. In fact he offered to refund me for the taco, not the meal I bought, just the taco. Um..... Thanks but no thanks. I've never eaten  there since. What made me even more mad was I wrote a letter to the owner regarding the situation and never heard a response. Very poor professionalism.....not even an apology!!!! It's too bad I loved taco johns."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. My kids couldn't even enjoy their food since it was spicy. The guacamole was disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"So I'm from Michigan and we don't got no Taco John's. Needless to say I was interested as I was traveling to see all these Taco joints that I've never heard of. I had to find out. I enter the building on a late night of traveling across America. My eyes and nose are greeted by pretty much exactly what I would expect by a Taco fast food joint honestly. But hey, it was clean. I had ordered the nachos, and you may be thinking regular nachos but no, instead of chips it was their signature potato things. I can't recall the name but it was basically a tater-tot. And it was pretty good. I also had the little donut nugget things, also not bad, a little overkill on frosting but alright. In the end I left with a full stomach and was content."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. BEWARE when eating here. Besides the food being absolutely disgusting with hard as a rock potato oles and cold stale tacos, they charged me for a large potato ole which I didn't order. No big deal, right? So I thought. Then within the 15 minutes I spent there, 3 others complained of the same exact thing. I think they were actually doing a scam to make 3 bucks off each person and hope they didn't notice! One lady came inside from the drive thru and said \"You going to give me this potato thing you put on my receipt and charged me for and I didn't even order?\" so don't waste your time here, the workers are all grade A jerks too even after I was super nice when they were trying to pull some scam! Probably mad they got caught. Who knows. Just go to Taco Bell lol."}
{"text":"I had the chicken street tacos and I thought they were really good.  I went through the drive through and it was fast and easy.  I really liked the fresh ingredients.  It was way better than Taco Bell.  I would like to go inside next time so I can try the different sauces."}
{"text":"Speaker in drive inaudible crackle. Went in to order, noticed a lot of employees in kitchen standing around. Ordered food (no major issues). Waited awhile (8 mins) for eggs to be done for breakfast burritos. Heard employyes speaking amongst themselves, using inappropriate language and expletives even with customers in earshot (volume loud enough). Watched one worker make tacos for the drive through, she broke the shells of each and womeone asked her, \"are you going to do new ones?\" She replied, \"eh, it don't matter they going to break anyway.\" After received food noticed appearance and quality not to same standard as other TJs I visited. Wife counted 3 pieces of egg in her burrito; was not even burrito she ordered. My burrito much the same. Hope for their sake (and owners) these are growing pains and not recurrent.  Justin"}
{"text":"Well, thought I'd try this place. I ordered chicken tacos and got beef tacos. Had to wait twice as long as for my correct order. The tacos were pretty nasty, they give you a bunch of nasty tots to go with the tacos. It's very similar to Taco Bell, just about twice the cost."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Fast service. Quality ingredients. Just like Taco Bell if Taco Bell didn't suck."}
{"text":"I may not understand the appeal of Taco Johns, and I want to say - I WILL give it another try. I stopped after a meeting one weeknight. I had heard positive comments about the Potato Oles, so I ordered a medium. I also ordered a Taco Bravo. The Potato Oles are skinny tater tots; they were good, but let's face it - I can cook these at home in my oven just as well. The Taco Bravo was good, but I wasn't a fan of the flavor; was it the salsa, or the sauce? I can't really tell. Like I said, I'll return and try something else and hope for a more positive experience. In the meantime, I can say the service I received was fast, polite, more than I expected, and is the main reason I'll return. I say give them a try."}
{"text":"I gave them a pass for the last time I was here and everything was frantic. I thought it was because Taco Bell was closed. Everyone was waiting a really long time. Employees were anxious and not friendly.  But now TBell is open. I came here because of a good coupon.  There was a line of ten-ish people waiting and the CSR cashier employee was looking frantic again. Apparently some guy was over charged. It took a good while to get it sorted out. They didn't handle too well but whatever. I was already there so I stayed. I got a cup for water and a bunch of black chunky things came out of the station and into my cup. It was super gross. You see stuff on the internet about how dirty drink stations are and theirs is one of them. So I dumped it out and took a soda. My food took forever to get made. Two burritos got to me in 14 minutes. Lots of people after me in line as well as drive thru got their food before me. The food comes and they're missing an ingredient. But missing out on that ingredient is more pleasant than going up to counter again so whatever. The food is ok. TBell would have been better. It's not that dirty in the dining room but that's a fluke. It's usually filthy. I've concluded it's simply not worth coming here."}
{"text":"Slowest drive through ever! We literally just waited more than 20 minutes for 2 tacos and an order of potato oles, with only 2 cars on line. Not sure we will be back here!!!"}
{"text":"Great imitation Mexican food. The potato ole's are the serious bomb diggity. Memories of the taco burger dance in my mind each time I visit. As a side note squirrels love the ole's. Want to bring all the squirrels to your yard? Bring the potato ole's!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Recently started going to it after our company brought in free breakfast from this place and it is great! I often go there now for lunch. The staff is always so very friendly. One gentleman with glasses always is able to make my special requests. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place overall.   I was pretty bummed when I drove all the way home and found out they forgot my burrito lmao. Having that said - when I returned, they were very professional and apologetic and even offered me a $5 voucher and a fresh batch of tater tots.   Food was pretty good too. It was pretty unique and about the farthest thing away from actual authentic mexican food but I enjoyed it.  Overall great service, good food. Above average for a fast food taco joint."}
{"text":"Wow, what happened?  We used to love this place, but on our last two visits we've encountered some of the dumbest people to ever roam the Earth.  I mean.... We asked for two orders of MexiRolls tonight and the total came to more than $140.00!  When he adjusted the total to $13.06, I handed him $20.11. He started getting out a fistful of change until I stopped him and pointed out that he owed me seven bucks and just a nickel in change.  On our last visit, we waited more than twenty minutes while an obviously untrained young woman couldn't seem to operate the cash register.     The food is still good, but the aggravation just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I was about to write a review about how their taco's are hands down the best in town and the potato oles are amazing... but I just noticed every single review I've written so far has been mark as restricted. LAME . peace out yelp it was fun while it lasted but I have better things to do than write reviews that get thrown in the junk bin"}
{"text":"This place offers Mexican food even blander than Taco Bell. The potato wedges were not that good also. The burrito with beef almost seemed tasteless. I wouldn't recommend visiting this place again if you like Mexican food."}
{"text":"I just made my first visit to this establishment and I can soundly say that I would rather stab myself in the face with a screw driver than eat here again. The food was illegally cold. I'm contacting the health department. I was given no napkins in the drive through and not offered sauce. The kid in the window looked at me like a crazy person when I asked for these things. Also, no receipt. I think I was over charged but can't prove it. Never again."}
{"text":"If I could give less than a star I would. When we got there it was kind of busy but not crazy. One guy asked for his money back because he was waiting for 20 minutes and they didn't even have it started yet. We waited almost a half an hour for some street racis, regular taco and a burrito. When we got our food, they forgot some of our food. When we asked about the Ole's, the waitress was like \"I think so, do you want them?\" Duh!! We didn't pay for a combo for nothing! Should of known it was going to be bad when the girl asked if we wanted two cups for our TWO combos! Drinks come with combos! There was no sense of urgency either. They didn't seem to care and were super slow!! It took us less time to eat than to get our food. The only somewhat good thing is the food was ok. Not a half an hour wait worth though! Never going back!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fast, fast food, continue on down the road.  I keep asking myself why I come back to this place, average food at best, and deal with TERRIBLY slow service. And when I say slow, we are talking 10 minutes plus, you are the only person in the restaurant, slow.  The wait was so bad one time that the guy at the drive-thru was gone so long that when he came back to the window he wanted to charge me again for my order. And it took 5 minutes more after that to get my food after he asked if I got my drink that he gave me 5 minutes prior.  Go to Taco Bell if you wan fast food Mexican, this place is totally not worth the length of time you will be waiting to get your food."}
{"text":"Meh - Might be a 4 star  The good - a cup of refried beans were tasty.  The bad - a crispy chicken burrito was smothered in melted American cheese, not in any way crunchy, and not much chicken on a doughy soft flour tortilla.  Ticket time was 10 plus minutes and price for 2 items over $7.  Mediocre it was, return I will not."}
{"text":"Well I had to stop by again to get my potato ole fix. Place is still a pigsty. Clean up your store!!!! Messy tables, floors, fountain drink area. It's disgusting and because this is the only TJ's in the Madison area I'm stuck going here. Good Grief! Time to write to corporate."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous get to the window and they don't even know what my order was then give me lip!"}
{"text":"We like the food usually at Taco John's but they seem to be having trouble hiring competent workers.  (May if they paid them more.)  My main complaint is that they do not give a drive-up customer a receipt routinely.  That should happen without the customer having to ask for it.  They no longer have the punch cards to encourage repeat business because one is able to log info online to get the rewards, but you cannot do that without the receipt.  And if you try to phone them, they do not answer.  Not a good way to run a business."}
{"text":"Taco John's is far from being authentic or gourmet, but for a fast-food gringo taco chain I really don't think it's too bad. It seems to be something like what people say Taco Bell was in the '70s and '80s: greasy and filling without being too artificial-tasting.  I didn't really find the place to be especially dirty, or the server to be any less polite than I'd have expected. I guess the table-service aspect could be making people pay more attention to politeness/impoliteness than they would otherwise."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for late lunch/early dinner while charging the Tesla. The only food options within a 2 minute walking distance of the charging station are Panda Express (which I never eat) or Taco John's. It was our first time seeing the restaurant and decided to give it a try.   The first thing I noticed when walking in is the overwhelming smell of paint- arguably because the place just opened. There were a lot of first-timers so it took a while for the line to move. I suggest looking at the menu online first!   The items I ordered totaled around $25: street taco trio combo with potato ole, fish tacos, chicken quesadilla, churro, and a single shrimp taco. The Potato Oles are basically hash brown rounds. The quesadilla has wayyy too much cheese even though I chose the \"chicken only\" option. The fish in the fish taco was crispy, but the sauce was sparse. The churro was hot, but becomes too sweet after you eat half. My favorite has to be the street tacos. The pico de gallo and garlic-lime sauce is perfect. There is also a salsa station on the side for you to add flavors to your items.   If you choose to dine in, the food will be brought to your table. I think Taco John is a more fresh alternative to Taco Bell. Would definitely visit again when we are charging the car."}
{"text":"Hello you, it's me again.   I went slummin' big time today over in Monona.  I decided to stop and get myself some good ol' Taco John's fast food.  They call their food \"West-Mex,\" instead of \"Tex-Mex.\"  So..........so clever, I get the shivers.    I pulled up to the drive thru and ordered a #6 grilled chicken burrito combo.  The eager beaver on the other side screamed at me \"CHICKEN OR BEEF??\"  Before I could answer she screamed it again \"CHICKEN OR BEEF!!!!!!!!!\"  I admit, I was irked by this, but I let it slide because I'm just good natured like that.    You know how I roll.  However, when I got the window a girl, perhaps late teens, early twenties, glared at me while I handed her the money.  She took the money and then slammed the window shut so hard it actually bounced back open a little ways.  After waiting for at least 5 minutes, she opened the window again and thrust a bag at me, and then again slammed the window shut.  I looked in the bag and saw two beef tacos.  WTF?    I ordered #6 grilled chicken burrito beeeeotch.  My jolly good nature was quickly flying out the window.  Despite her \"I hate you and want you to die\" attitude I decided to cut the kid some slack.  Retail is hard, working fast food is harder.    So I looked earnestly at the window until she opened it again and glared at me.  \"This is the wrong order,\" I said quite kindly.    Then she looked at me like Bon Qui Qui from King Burger on MAD TV and said \"oh hellllllll noooo!\"  She grabbed the bag and slammed the window shut again.    I waited another five minutes, hoping she wasn't in the back making up my burrito with a side of steaming terd to go.    She flung open the window again and said \"What!!  What did you order!!?!?!\"    At this point I had lost my patience, and I hulked out.  \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  I ORDERED A #6!\"    This did not phase her.  She just slammed the window shut again.  I considered ramming my car into the building repeatedly until they gave me my burrito.  I also considered tying her to my bumper by the hair and then speeding away.  But no, friends, I did not go postal.  I just stared at the reflective window and daydreamed about her falling into the deep fryer.  Just then she opened the window and thrust another bag at me.  I took it, and as I looked up at her once more, it seemed like slow motion.  The word F*CK slowly bellowed out from her festering mouth.  Stunned, I looked down into the bag to see that the order was finally right, so I looked back up at her as she was for the last time violently slamming the window shut and yelled \"YOU DESERVE THE EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH AWARD!!!\"  Then I drove away.  After this lovely exchange between two well-mannered ladies, like afternoon tea in the sun garden in our frou-frou garments and wide brimmed hats, I promptly dropped my burrito on the floorboard of my car rendering it inedible, (at least to me), and alas I will never know what that steaming terd burrito tasted like."}
{"text":"Taco John's actually has pretty good street tacos, but the rest of the food is a bit mediocre. Some swear by the potato ole (tater tots) but they just don't do it for me when I can find better loaded tots at Cracked and other places. I do like that you can take some fresh salsa home with you."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru EVER at this location.  When I placed my order I had to repeat my drink 3 times, and she almost gave me no potatoes instead of no tomatoes on a meat and potato burrito.  Seems like staffing needs a change... need to find people who are capable of listening thoroughly and expediting the drive thru line efficiently."}
{"text":"Brand new Taco John's just opened on 2/13/2017. Great to finally get one of these in town. Stopped in yesterday food was out pretty fast and tasted great. If you havent had TJ 's before you should try it."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a late dinner on the way to pick someone up from the airport.  I went out of my way for Taco John's.  I placed my order at 8:54pm and the first thing I noticed was that the Salsa Bar was already cleaned out for closing.  They don't close for another hour.  I had to point it out to the lady taking my order.  She politely asked which salsas I would like and brought what I would explain as sample sizes out with my food.  The place was clean and the drive through was busy.  This will not stop me from coming back to this place.  I love Taco John's, I grew up with it long before I ever had Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Grew up on Taco John's in Iowa. Most restaurant s are good, not this one. They never get my order right. One night they gave me the wrong order. One bite and I went into anaphylaxis shock. Their employees act like they would rather be somewhere else. If you have an allergy stay away. They don't care if they get the order right"}
{"text":"Service was good, three of us got 3 different drinks and all the drinks were flat, ended up dumping our drinks and getting tea and other non carbonated drinks. Food was pretty good. The app is a great deal, used it for the first time today!"}
{"text":"super potato oles were good. love the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"This place used to be LIGHTNING fast, back in the day.  I didn't know if Joe (original owner) was having a seizure back then, or making tacos he was so fast.  Now? Ugh!  SLOWER than SLOW!!  You do realize there's a Taco Bell a block away from you, don't you?  Figure it out!"}
{"text":"You want your Ole's? You want your crunch taco? You got it. I mean, it's a fast food place. The staff seem to have a good time, although you might end up bussing a previous occupant's table before you can sit down, depending on the time of day. For unapologetically Americanized tacos, they've got your number."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Taco Johns.  I'm definitely a frequent buyer.  Taco, burritos, oles - oh my! Way better than Taco Bell.   If you want a quick and delicious meal stop by."}
{"text":"Just experienced taco johns for the first time the other day, loved it couldn't wait to experience it again...went to this location on the way home from out of town and it WORST SERVICE EVER!!! They had a bunch of unexperienced children working...here's a few examples:  They gave us no receipt no napkins Offered us no sauce no straws for our drinks (didn't know what we ordered for our drink they had to ask us at the window) Gave us wrong food Chicken was uncooked, very chewy  Burrito was made completely wrong  The kid with the fro was hanging out the window very unprofessional charged us with stuff that we didn't order   ALL AROUND HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!  The owner of this establishment needs to clean house with all the employees here and get new professional ones! I will eat taco johns again, but never at this location"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food restaurant. They have the best soft shell tacos. They're meat is really soft and has a good taste. They're sauce is really good as well. They're potato ole's are really good and seasoned well (and very good with ketchup.. Or nacho cheese if you're my dad, lol). I would definitely choose Taco John's over Taco Bell any day."}
{"text":"Sorry I previously posted a bad review thinking this was at a different location.  This location is great.  Food was good and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on here. The place is filthy. Almost every empty table had food slobbered on it. The floor felt like there was a layer of oil on it...almost fell a number of times when I first came in. I'm guessing this is no longer owned by the Klinzings, because no way would they be OK with the conditions.  So sad because we will travel across town to come to the only TJ's in the area.   May not return.....  1 month later I was stupid enough to give it another try and....   Just when I thought 1 Star was being tough! HA! How about -5 stars!!! Please don't waste your time, especially in the drive up. They NEVER EVER EVER get an order correct. I think we will be driving 2 hours to the Black River Falls or perhaps the one south of Madison. This is so incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could. Twice now I have found hair in my super burrito. Not even going to wait for three strikes on this one, I'm done. Obviously some cleanliness issues going on at this location."}
{"text":"Oh, Taco John's...what did I ever do to wrong you so?  I thought you and me were close, TJ--I mean, back when I was in high school, you were the mad shizz! I always repped you to the heathens who thought running to the border to ring bells was better than your food. Quesadilla--I hardly know her!  But now, now...now you are but a paltry shade of your former self. Did you get taco cancer and are wasting away from the inside?  What happened to making the goodness I used to know?    Once, TJ--you and me were tight.  We were bros.  We had each others' back.  Now, you're more concerned with half-heartedly throwing me some frozen crap that's been deep fried and drowned in sauce with some brown, wilty lettuce and lifeless tomatoes.  What up with that, TJ?  Is that how you treat your boy now?  I thought I knew you, man.  I thought I knew you."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Chalk it up to the new opening, but if they continue this trend, they can be another sub-par version of a popular food chain. I came here on 2/17 for dinner and it was simply atrocious. The parking lot is very small and the restaurant seating matches this as well. The other shops next door haven't even open yet... It was easy putting in the order with the staff, however after waiting 25 minutes for \"fast food\" I finally got my order. I counted over 14 staff members including the likely owner in the kitchen and the food was still moving out at a snail pace. To make matters worse, this was carryout and as I drove out of the parking lot and reaching in to figure out if I had gotten all my food, they had missed my taco order and I had to swing on back. The food is a bit fresher than Taco Bell and a slightly better quality. I had the shrimp tacos which were small shrimps fried up and placed in a flour tortilla. At least the veggies were nice and fresh without any browning. The nacho is definitely not anything special. It reminds you of a nacho supreme at taco bell again with slightly better quality meat and some guac. If they don't keep up with the quality and if there service goes down even more, this place will be closing up shop in the next year. It was good to try once, but I think I will pass on future visits because of these issues.  Pros: fast food options for fish/shrimp taco limited time, fresh and clean compared to taco bell  Cons: 25 minutes for fast food is atrocious, missing items in the order is just being careless, very small parking lot  Hidden deals:  Download the app and every 5 dollars gets you one punch on your digital card, after 8 punches you get a free combo.   Health code rating: B. Brand new restaurant clean, however staff needs to be reminded of clean hygiene and keeping up with the standards. I can see how the taco station can become quite dirty if people are not cleaning up after making tacos for a while."}
