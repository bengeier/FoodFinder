{"text":"\"Maryland Crab cakes\" are from canned crab meat. The charge $28 for canned crab meat... Canned.... Salad had withered greens soaked in dressing: reminded me of old napkins soaked with rag-water. Everything is from frozen/canned ingredients. They had to downgrade the hotel from a Hilton to a Doubletree because everything is going down the hole. Don't get me started on my room!"}
{"text":"Quiet, excellent service, great steaks and great prices.  The only negative was a somewhat soggy Caesar Salad.  Our table had the sirloin, NY cut, and the filet.  Both were perfectly cooked and came with crisp broccoli and potato of choice. Great wine selection with reasonable prices. It is a well, kept secret in a land of steakhouses."}
{"text":"Good food, but lackluster appearance and marginal wait-staff do not warrant the premium price tag ($25-$30 per entree). Definitely not the elegance I expected. Fleming's is a far better choice in the same price range."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the last year.  It is a bit of drive for me but is often worth it.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  This would be a good place for a date but it is a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Food was great, and the staff was great.  My wife & I went there on a date.  The staff made us feel very comfortable.  It is pricey, and generally hotel food is :-(  Dessert was $8.  Appetizer was $13.  Glass of wine, $9.  You get the picture"}
{"text":"NY strip ($28) done to perfection and worth it! Enuff said."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Dint be fooled that is in a hotel. The Berkshire pork chop was one of the best I have ever tasted."}
