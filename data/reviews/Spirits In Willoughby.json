{"text":"I'm very confused by this place...  

beautiful bar with an amazing patio.  Delicious house made wine and  VERY small menu of mid range tasty appetizers....  but the owner seems to think it's a dive bar...

Like I said it's a beautiful bar with a mid range menu, but the female staff are all dressed in tiny plunging tank tops and super short shorts.  The two girls working the night we were there were both incredibly rude and inattentive.  They acted like they were incredibly overworked with only 8 customers at the bar.  When we first sat down we didn't get a Hi or Hello, but were greeted with \"What do you want?\" followed by \"I guess you want menus huh?\" 

  The owner (pointed out to us by a server) had no problem hanging out behind the bar in a dirty t-shirt and pouring himself a few beers.  Not uncommon behavior in a seedy dive bar but a little surprising in a nice dtw restaurant.

All in all this place could be a nice addition to dtw,  but the people who run it need to figure out what they want it to be and either train their staff better or find new ones."}
{"text":"We just came for drinks/to hang out. The spot is Cool in that it's nothing fancy and in a barn. In warmer months (we went in October) they had cornhole setup outside as well as bocce which we enjoyed playing with some tables outside. It's a different feel from the rest of dtw - more relaxed and seemed to have a more middle aged/ adult clientele. 

We also tried the wine- I like dry red and thought their merlot was great but the other more sweet wines were not that great - I also do not drink/like a lot of sweet wine and only tried the reds so I may not be the best person to comment.  We did not try any food but did not look like it had an extensive menu or anything too great, just some simple bar food.

Overall it's a great place to come hang out and enjoy wine or drinks (and actually hear each other talk) or play some games after going to dinner at one of the other area restaurants. I loved the bocce courts and will be back for that and a few glasses of merlot once winter passes!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Downtown Willoughby bar scene. Friendly bartenders. Great outdoor patio with 2 bocce ball courts. A nice big fire pit with seating around it. Good wine -grapes from California! They have live music. Plenty of big tv's to watch the games. Spirits has become our go to spot the last 6 months."}
{"text":"Well we finally made it in here ! Such a cute place a little bright inside but cute. Prices are reasonable however the food or what little they currently offer not so cute. We decided to try the pickle dip $6 well we got a maybe 5 oz plastic bowl of pickle dip surrounded by a large handful of mini pretzels on a paper plate.  Little effort went into thinking this one up and it honestly is pretty cheesy of a dish why not make a soft pretzel to offer it be so much more welcoming,  i hope they plan on expanding their menu and improving on their offerings because it is or can be a great place with the right theme and food. We will have to check it out in the spring and see how it is coming along."}
{"text":"Another great addition to downtown Willoughby. Unbeatable atmosphere and great service. Wouldn't expect anything less, as every server has extensive experience with some of the best places in the area. It really is an All-Star staff. Menu is limited, as they're just getting started. But what they have is very good. Went one night with a food truck in the parking lot and it hit the spot. House wines are quite good. The beer selection is on the mark with a nice balance of microbrews. Bocce courts are a nice touch. The place was packed on a Friday night, and I'm sure it will be from here on out. Good luck to the fine folks who work here. Can't wait to try it again"}
{"text":"Currently sitting at the bar as I write this review, that's how turned off I am by this place. The bartenders are absolutely MISERABLE. I haven't seen a smile since I've been here. A bartender with dark brown curly hair told me I was \"too happy\" for her. I tried to order a vodka cranberry and she told me I wasn't allowed. I asked why and she said \"I don't know, it's on the ballot though.\" She looked as if she was on drugs, moving slowly. The couple at the bar next to us was looking at he menu and the bartender came over and asked, \"did you figure it out yet?\" Extremely rude.  I settled with the red sangria which was good! We ordered 3 apps which were decent at best. Styrofoam plates too??? The place looks really cool and updated inside, the employees ruined the atmosphere completely. This place opened before they were ready to open. I couldn't leave a review long enough for how horrible the atmosphere was."}
{"text":"Great service, wide variety of beer, and good signature drinks. What's not to like? Cool atmosphere too. Inside has a sports bar feel, and the walls have large doors that open up completely to the outdoor area and bocce courts. Awesome place to hang out, especially on nights with good weather! Fair warning though, it is supposed to be haunted so drink at your own risk."}
{"text":"Niki provided excellent service and the drinks have an exceptional value. I highly recommend Spirits. They are not a chain and I have always had a great time there."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down. It has the best patio, bar, and location in DTW. The speciality drinks are amazing! 

Maybe I'm a little biased because I live a mile down the road.............   No. No. No. This place is legit. I am Sooooooo thankful that I'm only a mile down the road! 

Keep up the good work, Spirits!"}
