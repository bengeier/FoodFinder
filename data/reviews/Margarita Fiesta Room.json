{"text":"One thing you have to try when you go here is the guacamole and the alcoholic drinks. The guacamole comes in this stone bowl with the masher inside. So very fresh and so very good. Endless chips come with and it's amazingly filling if you're just looking for a quick snack. The sangrias are also very yummy. A huge pitcher is around 23$ but a cup - which looks more like a bowl - is around 7$. A great place to hang out and enjoy authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great patio and margaritas make a perfect combo for the summer! Been here a few times, the servers are usually super happy and friendly and the food is decent. I think it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Terrible...at one time this place was considered a very good, authentic Mexican restaurant. Usually you can't go too wrong with Mexican food. 2 out of the 3 meals were average at best and mine was dreadful. I couldn't wait together the taste of funky grease out of my mouth.     I am giving the one star because the Margarita was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is decent, the service is always friendly, But the cleanliness is an issue. While walking through the kitchen to get to the patio a noticed roaches.  Also, from a inside source, it's confirmed that the owner (who constantly watches over customers) and the kitchen staff pee in the kitchen sink.  Also, it's confirmed that the nacho chips and salsa, if half eaten, get re-used for the next customers. *bleck"}
{"text":"I had a great dinner here with friends last night.  4 main courses and 1 drink (I drank alone...) came to around $85 before tax and tip.  We were all happy with the service and the food.  I ordered veggie fajitas and was impressed to find a variety of vegetables cooked in a delicious sauce.  The tortillas seemed fresh and grilled.  Although my meal was very filling, I noticed that a couple of my friends polished off their food entirely - an indication that the food was good, but perhaps the portions of some of the meals might have been larger.  After our meal, we were the only ones left in the restaurant, but the woman working there told us to stay as long as we liked.  There was no rush here, and we appreciated that.  I'm not sure if it is a family business of some kind, but it certainly seems like it - in a good way!"}
{"text":"Margarita- a room for fiestas! I stopped by here with a few friends for a drink and light snack.   But I didn't get a margarita- silly, adventurous me- I got a mango daiquiri. On the menu there is a list of multiple fruit flavours that you can have made into a margarita or daiquiri. I was thinking it would be like a smoothie, like how I used to get virgin strawberry daiquiris as a kid. Hello, I'm trying to revisit my childhood here! Instead the drink was more like a slushie/melted snow cone with no real mango flavouring in sight. Still yummy, just not what I was expecting and of lower quality. A savior was the drinking glass it came in! A huge \"fishbowl\"-like goblet!   As for snacks, we went minimal this time and just grabbed some guacamole. I had low expectations. But out comes this black, stone motor and pestle filled with a bright and creamy guacamole sprinkled with diced tomato! The tastes were great accompanied with nice chips and a little bowl of a homemade hot sauce. The presentation proved to be as useful as it was impressive because you could use the pestle for spreading. I definitely want to try more food here.   Cute place and I can't wait to try the garden back patio on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review restaurants if I've only been there one time or if I'm not knowledgeable about the type of cuisine, but I'll make an exception for Margarita's since I was taken there by someone who is a regular.  A friend brought me to Margarita's on the weekend. We sat on the back brick patio courtyard, which had a really good, laid-back atmosphere.  The specialty at Margarita's? Margaritas: eight fruity flavours to choose from, each served in an enormous glass goblet. I got to taste mango and raspberry. Mmm. I want to come back here one night with a larger group and try all of them. I had a nice, chilled Dos Equis which I have been drinking for years before those 'most interesting man' commercials started airing on TV, so there.  So, the giant alcoholic slushes may seem like the kind of gimmick you'd find at a place with very ordinary food. Not so. I had the pozole soup which was absolutely delicious. I could tell it was homemade with all kinds of fresh ingredients, plenty of spices and tender pieces of chicken. Wow, it was so good! My friend ordered the calamari which seemed fairly average. For the main course, I had a not-very-adventurous chicken quesadilla (I actually ordered beef, but when the dish arrived, I had been wishing I'd ordered chicken anyway). Served with a green salad, the quesadilla's tortilla had been grilled to a perfect, crisp texture and the cheese and fillings were lovely and melty hot and very tasty. I savoured every bite.  I will be back soon, for sure."}
{"text":"As of today, 30 September 2012, this is the worst restaurant that I have eaten at in all of Toronto.  I went in with a friend, we sat at the bar and ordered 2 margaritas, he ordered a double, I ordered a single.  My margarita had  plenty of large chunks of ice in it that should have been blended, the bartender/server overcompensated on the bar lime for my friend's double, and thus was unable to fit the margarita into his glass, there was a full margarita left in the blender, which, since it took him 15 minutes to make my friend's margarita, I was finished mine, asked me \"I made too much, do you want this one?\" I promptly agreed, I thanked my friend who was angry that I was awarded a margarita at his expense.  His margarita had chunks of ice floating in it too.  Both had excessive amounts of salt, and very weak bar lime.  Now for the main course, we split fajitas for two.  What comes to mind when you think about fajitas?  For me, I think rice, peppers, tomatoes, cheese, onions.  Get ready for something hilarious.  Margarita's is located next door to Chinese take out.  Our \"Mexican\" entree arrived, it  had 6 small tortillas, and a small plate of vegetables, which were broccoli, water chestnuts, green beans and cauliflower, overcooked and stuck to the skillet, with fried rice that contained bits of chicken (my friend is a vegetarian).  There is zero doubt in my mind, that the bartender/server went next door to the Chinese take out, purchased mixed vegetables and fried rice, returned to the back entrance and threw the items on a skillet.  My friend and I were in hysterics about how funny this meal was, this fajitas for two was more than $20, and an absolute joke.  We spent the rest of the day laughing, and to this day, Margarita's is the biggest disappointment of a restaurant that exists."}
{"text":"I've come here for drinks a few times.  You have to try the margaritas.  Who doesn't love frozen cocktails?  They come in big fish bowl glasses with a sweet/salty rim and lots of alcohol!  The hidden patio in the back is great in the summer time.  Kind of weird that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the patio.  I wonder how sanitary that is???  I recently went back for dinner with my brother and sister-in-law.  I had the taco salad.  It was filling and had all of the traditional things you'd expect in a taco salad.  My sister-in-law had the enchiladas, which I would get next time.  They looked really tasty.  There's a big pile of lettuce on the top, which I'm always a big fan of with Mexican as I like a bit of crunch.  Nothing about the food stood out that much.  It was good, but didn't knock my socks off.  Despite that, I would go back.  The only thing that may deter me from going here for food and not just drinks is that the prices are pretty high."}
{"text":"Wait time: 15 minutes for guacamole. 45 minutes for first entree.   Food:  Chicken Enchiladas? More like chicken grease soup with vegetables!  Normally, enchiladas are corn tortillias, topped with cheese, filled with shredded meat and cooked in sauce. This was a Fajita soaked in greasy sauce. Topped with too much raw lettuce and raw onions, the tortillias were sitting in a pool of watery grease. Inside it had only a small amount of chunks of chicken and mostly onions and bell peppers - which made it soggy. My friend also had the enchiladas, with a different sauce. She wasn't impressed, but hers wasn't as greasy so she decided to eat it anyway. The cheese was the good part. But for $15 - this was just not right. The rice on the side was also old and a few pieces were completely hard. The guacamole was great, but the chips were overcooked, stale and rock hand to chewy in texture. I've had much better \"fresh\" chips.   Tried to order another meal to replace the first, but 25 minutes later my friend was done eating and there was no sign of it at the pass so I cancelled the order.   They took the meal off the bill and were nice about it. Maybe I'm being overly picky, but I know what a real enchilada is and this wasn't one. Might try the fajitas or something else next time. The back patio is really pretty and the drinks are big. :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Margarita's since I was about ten years old, at which point I fell in love with the savoury nacho chips, burritos, and chicken-lime soup. Now that I am legally able to enjoy their actual Margarita's, my love affair continues. They come in gigantic glasses, and they definitely don't scrimp on the alcohol here. The vibe is warm, authentic, and festive - and you can't beat the patio atmosphere in the summer, especially at night. The service can be a bit slower on busy nights, but I have never been disappointed in the quality of the food. Good apps too, fun place to go in a group."}
{"text":"This is in my neighbourhood, so I visit fairly often.  The food is generally very good, but can be hit & miss.  I once had the black bean soup, and it was so thick and CRUNCHY, my fork stood up in it.  But overall, this is pretty tasty stuff.  The cooks are all Mexican, which I guess is a good sign.  The patio is very nice and laid-back in the summer.  My main complaint is the price. I'd say, for the portion size and quality of food, the bill should be about $8 less per person, than it actually is.  I regularly drop $30 there, when I feel it should have been around $20.  Note:  For some reason in this day and age, this place does not accept debit."}
{"text":"The service here was decent. The food quality was decent. The problem we had was the portion size. We odered chicken enchiladas and when we received them we honestly thought they had just brought us the side salad. The enchiladas are served in a small dish that is garnished with lettuce. It was a waste of money and we had to go to another restaurant afterwards, as we were still starving."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEIR FOOD HERE :)   Their guacamole is delicious! Their topos (nachos) are great to share while you wait for your party to decide what they want, and they are finger licking good. There margaritas are delicious fresh juice. And I personally love their chicken enchiladas in the green sauce, but I have tried their taquitos, burritos,fajitas and they are all good! I have come here on multiple occasion and with many different groups of people and everyone always loves their food. Their desserts are good too! The only bad thing is if you want a refill on your water you really have to ask, don't be afraid to get their attention."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once on a date and once with friends.  Before this, I always disliked mexican food because of a bad experience at a mexican place in Montreal, but I thought I would give this a try.  It turns out that this place was really good, and I have loved mexican ever since.  The restaurant is small one of the many on Baldwin but the place is kind of cozy.  The food was really good, lots of flavours. I have tried the fajita (to share) and the enchilada.  The portion sizes are decent.  I would definitely come back again!  Reccommended."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but not terrific and the waitress actually said as we sat down \"I have something to do, I'll be back in a few minutes\" - there were only 3 tables full on the huge patio and the other two were eating. So that was strange. But, it made us laugh.   She also brought me chicken instead of beef. That's my beef.   I could be convinced to return but only for apps and drinks.   Lovely garden patio."}
