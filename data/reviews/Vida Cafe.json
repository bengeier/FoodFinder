{"text":"Pretty nice place, Great Hookah!
This was my first visit to Vida and certainly won't be my last. The place is in Richmond hill, located at a small plaza with good parking space.
Vida is big from the inside, although doesn't look like it from the outside. Has many booths, tables and semi-private sections.
Good service, fast and portions and presentations are spot on.
Now to the best part, their hookah is pretty good, one of the better ones that I have tried, and I've had that in so many places around the GTA.
I tried a grape mint hookah with Ice Hose, it comes in a Khalil Maamoun hookah, which still stands as best hookah manufacturer, and since the place is new, their hookahs still operate perfectly, smooth and clean.

Hookah menu has about 15-20 flavours, with some cool add-ons like Ice Hose, milk base, red bull base, etc...
They have a good menu with food, apps, and desserts. Also features an open bar with hard liquor.

It wasn't busy at all on a Sunday evening, but the server said that it gets busy on Fridays and Saturdays, and Karaoke Wednesday, so it's always good to call for reservations on these days."}
