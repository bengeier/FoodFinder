{"text":"Firebirds. It was in a word fantastic. The service and the food were above board. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a sit down enjoy dinner restaurant...my steak was very flavorful and cooked to perfection my wife's prime rib was perfect as well...they can expect us as regulars here...Eric the manager made sure we had a great experience and he performed above and beyond...well done everyone"}
{"text":"Christopher took excellent care of our party of 10! He was friendly, efficient and personable. The food was good but the service was spectacular. He needs a raise immediately!"}
{"text":"Food and waiter (Tom) were good.  However, the ambiance sucked!!!  Big time!!  Our foursome spent $240.00 with tip ... But, the stupid restaurant let in a table of 5 that included 3 kids with the OLDEST about 3.  The woman was so fat and untidy that it was disgusting.  The gorged the kids with \"free\" bread and at the end one of the kids threw up!! Did I say disgusting?!!  And, the kids screamed all through the meal AND our time there.  We complained to management who did NOTHING!!  For $240 bucks ... NEVER, NEVER again.  Spend your money somewhere else ... where it's appreciated and they treat you as valued customers ... Very poor experience.  We should have been compensated for their failure to deliver a quality experience & their incompetence."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a fine dining experience - a night away from our toddlers. We took a chance with Firebirds as we had never been. We started the night with the lobster spinach queso, which was amazing with the fresh bread (in lieu of the chips) served prior to the entree (as suggested by our amazing waiter, Sam). He was funny and gave us a great feedback about the dishes and wine. We ordered the slow roasted ribeye, which was perfectly cooked - definitely try it. We also enjoyed the spiced pecan green beans and lobster tail. We ended the night with a warm brownie (it's large and my husband and I shared). The prices were fair and honestly we felt we received a LOT of bang for our buck. Even after leaving a 20% tip, our bill was surprisingly affordable. We loved the high end feel of the restaurant while it was perfectly acceptable to wear jeans. It is casual without pretention. Loved it all!"}
{"text":"Didn't really know a reservation was needed. Got to the door and the hostess said there'd be about a 2 hour wait. Luckily someone else stepped up and said there was seating on the patio. The indoor seating was very loud anyways so the patio ended up being perfect. Food and service was good but will definitely remember to make a reservation next time."}
{"text":"Love the tortilla soup here it is my favorite. The staff is usually great. It is a little pricey for my budget but if I want to go somewhere a little more special I choose here."}
{"text":"Am here from NYC visiting friends and we went to this place tonight for dinner.  Place was bustling, we waited a litle bit for a table, not a problem.  Service was very good and attentive and super pleasant.   Food was truly mediocre at best.  Simple burger was just a plain ole patty with bacon on it, fries were greasy...  Salad was .... Just ok. Overall. I wouldnt wait 35 mins again for this place, but dont get the burger.  Not a freshly ground burger ... Just a frozen patti and quite boring.   Friends had the lobster dip with nachos and said itnwas very good.   Just dont get the whole wood thing when nothing tasted like it was wood smoked.... ????"}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary. Overall, it was good, but not great. 

My Steak was quite a bit less done than I expected - Their \"Medium\" looked a lot more like most places \"Rare\". My wife's Prime Rib was excellent she said.

The Salad, Potato and the Lobster Spinach Queso were great, although probably a bit pricey for the amount you got with the queso. 

Service was really attentive.

For the price, I think I'll probably look elsewhere next time we celebrate our anniversary. It wasn't bad, but for the money, I think we can find something better."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful but the service was terrible! It was not only slow, but we were basically ignored several times. Then when someone did ask if we needed anything,  and we asked for more bread,  they never brought it! And they were not even very busy! Not sure if we'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Ribeye and Prime rib were great.  Service was great as always.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! My first visit! And the experience was great, i had lunch by the bar, and troy was very helpful , great customer service, and the food came out so quickly, i was surprised! And it was fresh and delicious! ( mondays they have a 1/2 off any 8oz wine) definitely my new spot! And prices are very reasonable!! Love ut here!"}
{"text":"I wonder if the walls of wine and liquor bottles shouldn't be on some \"great wonders of charlotte\" tour. That's what you see on entering, and it definitely sets the mood for the evening.

While I can't comment on the entrees (which were out of my price range this particular evening), the colorado salad was outstanding without having to pile on the usual unhealthy ingredients that makes salads taste good. We had an excellent server that really knew both the food and drink menus and was a very enjoyable and attentive person. 

Definitely a good place to relax with friends, though not necessarily if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"First time at Firebirds! Will definitely go back. Salmon was excellent. Mashed potatoes were also great! I recommend their Double Black Diamond Martini. Sweet and goes down smooth. The carrot cake was some of the best I have ever had in my life and our table also ordered the cheesecake, which was above average. If I must be constructive, the steak fries were average to below average for the price point and overall, I felt certain areas of the restaurant, like the bathroom, could use a bit of updating, but don't let those two areas keep you away. The pros easily out way the cons. Regarding our service, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had steak with pepper corns. Excellent!  Friend had meat loaf which was also excellent.   Service was very good.  First time here will go back"}
{"text":"The food is good, drinks are decent hostess service and some service or the waiters/waitresses definitely needs some work. I've been coming here for over 6 years and have never had an issue until they hired these new people. Especially when calling ahead and being told an hour wait which turns to over two hours. If anything get the double black diamond martini"}
{"text":"Huge portions.  Not very tasty though.  Overpriced.  Decent atmosphere.  I don't know why it's so packed.  

Disappointing beer selection.  They had Dogfish Head and I said \"60 minute\" or \"90 minute\"?  The waiter said \"Dogfish\".  I said \"which one?\"  He said \"Dogfish\"  So I said \"Who's on first, what's on second and I don't know's on third.\"  And then I ordered a lemonade because $1 went to finding a cure for cancer.  The lemonade was awful.  Just a cup of sugar including sugar drizzled on the rim of the glass.

Desserts were good.  But they gave us a really long skinny fork that was more like chopsticks.  Ever tried to eat ice cream or cheesecake with chopsticks?  Uh, yeah.

My co-patrons ordered steaks and reviews were mixed.  I ordered some kind of encrusted salmon.  OK.  The fried spinach was good but too salty.

Back to the huge portions.  Michelle Obama would not be a happy camper here.  They could change the name from Firebirds to Obesebirds.  It was too much.

I'm still in a daze from going here.  Sorry, but there are so many better restaurants at a much better price."}
{"text":"One of my favorite and more frequently visited place. Feels like your in the mountains with the dark wood framework and tables, dim lighting, and crackling fireplace. It can be a bit pricey, but there are a few options that aren't too expensive. I usually get the Aspen Sirloin - It's a lot of meat, very tender, and an excellent choice for the price conscious person that loves steak. Also you MUST try the Lobster Queso dip for an appetizer. No joke, it will literally change your life! And then to top it all off, go with the Creme Brûlée Cheesecake! The service is usually very good, but there are always going to exceptions. Overall Firebirds is one of my favorite restaurants, it has great food and it's perfect for romantic dinners or celebrating a special occasion! Also just a side note there is an open kitchen in the back of the restaurant (all stainless steal), where you can see the chefs prepare the food. I personally love this layout in restaurants... Perhaps it just gives me greater comfort that my food is being cooked in a sanitary environment."}
{"text":"The location is great as it is right off the freeway and near the Chandler Fashionsquare mall. The smell of the woodfire grill is evident when you enter but not overpowering. The restaurant was nice and classy. Prices were slightly high but my chicken sandwich was good. The chicken was tender and the veggies were fresh. The bun was very light and almost flakey. The fries were stale and unimpressive. The server seemed new and nervous. Overall I was satisfied but not overly impressed. I would go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite happy hour spot for years now. Services and food are always great. The double black diamond martini (favorite all time drink) and tenderloin trio are yum-o."}
{"text":"I wish I would have discovered this place sooner. I had the bluecheese mushroom filet mignon and it was perfect. The wine and scotch list were great too."}
{"text":"Recently had another great lunch at Firebirds.  I'm really becoming addicted to the French Dip sandwich!

One of our party ordered the ribs.  And while the server didn't offer after the plates were cleared, we REQUESTED a wet nap for post-ribs cleanup.

We were VERY surprised when a hot wet towel came to the table - much more effective and much more pleasant than a disposable wet nap in an impossible to open package!

Kudos to Firebirds - but offer this before it's requested!  Those who don't think to ask will appreciate it."}
{"text":"Just went to Firebirds for the first time.

Food was terrific - party sampled soup (smoked tomato bisque), french dip sandwich, baby back ribs, wood plank grilled salmon, cheeseburger and creme brulee cheesecake.  All were outstanding!  For the first time in recent  memory, all plates were empty at the end of the meal.  Thank you fellow Yelpers for mentioning both the bread and the burger.

One suggestion to the restaurant though - if you serve ribs, you should also serve up a warm wet towel or something else to aid cleanup at the end of the meal.  Even a little wet-nap would have been nice.

Decor was beautiful - rustic but high class cabin-y feel.  Noise level was a bit loud at lunch but the place was busy - no emply tables - through the entire lunch hour, until close to 2 pm.  Lighting in the ladies' room was a bit dark for lipstick application though.

There's a huge woodburning fireplace in the bar area and outdoor seating available.

Flyer on the table was promoting half price wines (both glasses and bottles) on Mondays.  Not sure if this is a seasonal promotion or permanent - but I'll try to get back there to indulge!

Comparably priced to places like 131 Main or Maggiano's or Red Rocks."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday and had to wait an hour for a table. The waitress was wonderful, but my entree was a disappointment. I ordered the rib eye which was tough, so I sent it back. I received another one which was again tough. I was asked by the manager if I wanted to order another entree, but by tgen my date was finished, so I decided to forget it. Thank god we had an appetizer. I would not go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service. My only complaints are that the menu is a touch limited, and the food is a bit pricey for what you get. That said, if you're big on steak or grilled chicken/fish you'll probably be pretty happy with this place. I myself opted for a burger, which was cooked perfectly and delicious. Their side salads are great as well, and the soup is also recommended.

On the whole a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance of firebirds.  All the food that we have tried has been very good and service has been great-Entree salads with chicken and shrimp, filets and appetizers. Even the complimentary bread is yummy. We try to go for dinner a little early since it gets pretty crowded on the weekends."}
{"text":"I had the New York steak with sweet potato waffle fries.  The steak was good for the price, it was not as tender as I would have liked or expected.  The waffle fries were awesome though.  The table bread is to die for.  Honestly it's my favorite thing there. And it's free."}
{"text":"Poor service and the steak was cooked wrong and full of gristle.  1st and last time there."}
{"text":"My mom, sisters and I went to Firebirds for the first time yesterday night. Our waiter was very nice, and the food was also very good. No complaints. I recommend going here for a family dinner or a friends night out. Great service and food."}
{"text":"I love! Love! Love Firebirds. If you go there, you're sure to enjoy there mouthwatering Filet Mignon with fresh steamed green beans, and the au gratin taters are to die for ( I'm a huge potato fan what can I say?). You can wash it all down with a nice red wine such as a Shiraz or a nice Cabernet. The staff is always one step ahead and smiling. Now, you know you're in a good place when the employees are always smiling. Words don't really describe this place, the ambience, or the food for that matter, but I'd never refuse friends or family a treat to this place.

{"text":"Let me start off by saying I went to this restaurant last night for the first time. It seemed appealing so my mom and I decided to try it. The service was ok. Our first waitress was awesome. Then we got a new waiter for some reason and he was alright. My mom ordered the prime rib with a baked potato and I ordered the sirloin with mashed potatoes and we both got a green salad. Her prime rib was cooked medium well and my sirloin was cooked medium. My steak was burnt on the outside and really pink on the inside. It didn't taste too bad but it was hard to chew as it wasn't very tender. For the price of the food I at least expected it to come with 2 sides but you only get one and you can add more for a not so good price. After we were done spending our $69 plus tip on mediocre food and drinks we went home and we both started to feel sick. So we went to bed. The next day aka today we both had upset stomachs, the chills, and nausea. I have been throwing up and have been in and out of the bathroom all day. I have a headache and I am weak. I think it's safe to say we got food poisoning. Next time I will get a decent steak/meal at a good price at Texas Roadhouse. I'm mad that I spent $80 just to get sick off of this food. Never again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came back to give them a second chance. The service was really good. My wife ordered the meat loaf which was good. I stayed away from the ribeye this time and ordered the filet which was really good. It was cooked to perfection. So big ups to our server Nigel who was very good"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a half dozen times and have never given it a second glance.  The only reason we stopped in this time was that it was Christmas Eve and the flu is running rampant in the Charlotte area and when I gazed into the food court it quickly transformed into a hipster night club where all the famous germs hang out.  Long lines with big germ bouncers while inside the all the who's who of Germville were drinking, dancing, and putting the moves on each other!  We immediately looked for a cleaner and climate controlled safer environment in which to dine.  We opted for the Fireside.

Not much to say.  The menu is limited and nothing spectacular and is somewhat pricey for what you get.  My daughter had the portabella burger and I had the parmesan crusted Mahi.  My Mahi was fresh and well cook but lacked any real flavors.  My daughter seemed to enjoy her portabella which was well put together.  Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable and provided us with fairly quick service.   Probably won't return to a firebirds, just don't think it is worth the money.  I believe there is way better food out there in that price range or less.  On the up side; we did get our valet ticket validated.  $5.00 is $5.00!"}
{"text":"On a Thursday lunch, this restaurant was busy.  However, we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.  It was well worth the wait.  The drinks and food was awesome and of great value.  I had the sesame crusted salmon.  It was the house specialty and it didn't disappoint.  I liked the fried spinach that came with it so much that I wish I got more of those instead of the mashed potatoes.  Those were good as well, but I really liked the fried spinach.  The server was excellent and very friendly.  My wife and I were very happy to have stopped by this restaurant.  Nice bar area also."}
{"text":"Great chain steakhouse.  Huge, lodge-like atmoshpere with an open kitchen so you can keep an eye on the chefs.  All meals are huge and always very good.  Some favorites:  Lobster Spinach Queso, Firebird's BLT salad, Blue Cheese Filet, and the Chili Rubbed Delmonico steak.  Great bar too!"}
{"text":"A representative for this restaurant reached out to me as a result of my previous review. My wife and I decided to try again simply based on them following up and accepting feedback. I am pleased to say that this location is our go to steak house now! The steaks were and still are comparable to the ones we had at the Rea Road location. Not every single time which is why 4 stars, but good enough to seem like more of a fluke occurrence rather than the norm as before. Bravo!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here two times this week to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke. BEST TASTING NEW YORK STRIP AND FILET WE'VE HAD IN CHARLOTTE HANDS DOWN! Juicy, tender, and flavor in every bite! Middle of the road price wise and well worth it! We'll DEFINITELY be back!

Update: We tried the Southpark location twice as it's closer to us but were very disappointed. We came back to this location  again and the steak was outstanding! This is now our benchmark for steaks in Charlotte. Morton's, Fitzgeralds, and BLT are pricey but the closest flavor wise in our opinion is BLT. The others are good for the experience, but if you just want a flavorful steak at a decent price, this is your place!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch since we have always enjoyed our visits to Firebirds.  This time, we had our $10 birthday coupon. We sat on the patio and experienced a screeching young child (not your fault) along with a screeching entry door (needs fixin').  Our server got lost and never came back to take our order so we had to ask another for assistance.  The salad we ordered did not arrive until just before our burgers even though we had requested it be served first (right away) since it took so long to order.  They were overcooked but, we ate them anyway.  The best part was their fries but, that's not enough to make us drive 15 miles to pay the overinflated prices.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to other Firebirds before and the food is always great.  Unfortunately, the service / management does not live up to the food.  I went in to the bar on New Year's Eve, a night you should have your A Team working.  If that was their A Team, they need to quickly restaff and/or hire a new GM.  There were 3 bartenders working, which should have been more than enough for the crowd on hand.  While the bar was full, it was never fully 2 deep.  Between the 3 bartenders, they ran around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Instead of splitting the bar customers between 2 of them and leaving the 3rd bartender for the servers at the service bar, all 3 tried to do everything.  The result?  The bartenders where constantly in each others way, servers and customers consistently waited longer for drinks than they should have, overcharging on my check, and a generally unpleasant experience.  I blame this fully on management for either not properly training their staff, not having a plan in place for NYE, or for not having the proper staff in place to begin with. 

Major Fail!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the ribeye was so juicy and tasty, and was cooked to the perfect medium rare. Our waitress was awesome. Definitely coming back for a date night soon (:"}
{"text":"The Delmonico steak sandwich is very good and a price performer :) but the Creme Brulee cheesecake is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  My sister & I were in town for the weekend from Cali...and we wanted to find a fun happy place to eat.

This place had food that melted in your mouth...I got the prime rib.
We sat on the patio which was wonderful.  The waitress was great. She knew her stuff & kept an eye on us while taking care of other people.  

Great memories...thanks!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at Ruth's Chris, Arrowhead Grill and Fleming's, I was pleased with Firebirds' great food, appropriate prices and excellent service!  I loved the seared ahi tuna appetizer and prime rib, and the loaded baked potato was delish.  The staff is polite, engaged and prompt.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time here, and the waitress was incredibly patient (Couldn't decide what to order). Filet Mignon it was called, but Gold it really was. One of the best pieces of meat I'd ever had.

My table was clean and comfortable, and the \"augratia\" (A potato side), was quite tasty. 

5/5!"}
{"text":"Well I am about a week late on this review,  I'm just in a yelp mood. So any who, needles to say,  I did not have a great experience at all. I stopped by there after a movie. Bad start from the get-go. No hostess to be found. Took at least 5 minutes just to get a table. Once there the server was obviously not interested in helping or very attentive.  He managed to mess up just about every aspect of the order,  drinks included. The kitchen could not cook proper meat temps to save thier life. Took them 3 tries and 30 minutes of waiting till they got it right.  Only thing they got right was the salad, go figure.  Even the manager was annoyed to even care.  In the end,  no comps or apologies. Maybe I was just there on a bad night. Regardless,  I don't care,  I just wasted 50 bucks for a bad experience. Many restaurants to choose from,  I will continue to avoid this place."}
{"text":"My parents and I came here for dinner tonight and we were blown away.  The food was incredible, and we each ordered something completely different. But what makes or breaks a restaurant is the service, and I have to say they went above and beyond. Sarah M. Was our server tonight and she was perfect. She was friendly, informative, and never rushed us. This was my first time dining here, but by no means will it be my last. Incredible food and drinks, and beyond amazing service!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Firebirds tonight. We had a wonderful evening. Our waiter was very professional and nice. We really enjoyed our food. Everything was just perfect from start to finish."}
{"text":"Love this place!  In reading the reviews noticed that no one mentioned their delicious key lime pie!  We like many other items on the menu along with the service but we LOVE the key lime pie!  Next time you go give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times over the past 5 years. Its always for someones bday or girls night. I do not understand what the hype is all about. The establishment itself is very pretty and the bread is great but steak, pasta and desserts are average to good but nothing that warrants those prices in my opinion."}
{"text":"The service is always exceptional here!  I recommend the sesame encrusted salmon."}
{"text":"The wait to get in was about 20 min but it was worth it!!!  The waiter was awesome and attentive. The food was great. I am from Maryland, so when you have Crabcakes on the menu and the waiter says they are great, I have to believe that you bumped your head.  My mistake, they were very good. They were on par with what I would find here, at the home of the Crabcake.  Way to go guys!!"}
{"text":"Just left there and had great customer service. I ordered prime rib and the cut  was tough and very difficult to chew.  I ate what I could and when the waiter came to remove our plates I mentioned that the prime rib was not good at all. The waiter apologized and said he would let his manager know. A few minutes later the manager, named Joe came to the table and asked me to tell him what was wrong with the prime rib. I explained that it was hard to cut and chew and that it looked like an end piece and that I didn't order an end piece. He apologized and agreed and told me that they don't serve end pieces unless the customer specifically asks for it. At the end of our conversation he told me that my meal was taken care of. I will definitely come back because of that excellent customer service experience."}
{"text":"Great food, service really needs work.  

We were  there for a late lunch, less than a dozen tables occupied and quite a high number of servers, and yet still waited almost fifteen mins for our drinks (water and pop). Service got progressively better with the meal once we complained but was only marginal at best by the end. 

The food itself was superb - excellent grilled chicken sandwich and one of the best French dips we have had in almost 30 years since a little old ma and pop shop our family used to frequent back in MN. 

A little pricey given the portions and the service is a definite negative,  but a decent choice in the area if you have the time and patience."}
{"text":"Have you ever had one of those moments?  You know, the ones that melt away all of the tensions and make you realize how lucky you are to live where you do, and be with the one you are with, doing whatever it is that brought you there.  These are the best moments in life.

Tonight was one of those moments.  It lasted forever.  From the moment we walked in the door, immediately greeted by two of the most welcoming smiles, to the casual stroll back to the car...holding the hand of that special person that has shared more than half of my life with me.

Service: Prompt, friendly, attentive and unobtrusive
Fare: Perfection to the last detail, from preparation to presentation
Price: What did it matter?

We both had filet mignon.  Hers with shrimp, mine with blue cheese sauce.  They blended nicely with the soft feel, but robust taste of the Zin.  They brought us an extra bread, hot enough to melt the butter instantly, but soft and subtle enough to taste and feel more like an entree than a free appetizer.  

I've been here three times, and this is the second time that I felt in the moment.  Our last visit was memorable only in it's mediocrity.  Two out of three is pretty good.  I know we'll try for three out of four."}
{"text":"We consider it a treat to go eat here, but the last 2 times we have had poor service from the same waitperson. She runs around a lot, but never gets it done. The meat has been way overcooked and we keep sending it back. Twice now no bread has been brought to our table unless we flag someone down to bring it. Might be a while tlll we return."}
{"text":"I saw all the positive reviews and was not impressed I thought the prime rib was overpriced I'm not opposed to paying for a good steak but this one was flavorless the wings were ok the best part was the smokey flavor"}
{"text":"The food, drinks and service at the bar during happy hour on Friday, April 13th were HORRIBLE.  The supposed \"corporate trainer bartender\" made the WORST drinks, jam-paced with ice-you only got about 2 drinks out of the glass before it was empty.  The bar was filthy dirty and she did not clean up after customers and we waited a long time only to get cold food.  The place was not busy as it was only 4pm - absolutely no excuse.  If she is a \"corp trainer\" then they are in trouble !!!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal!  The fresh hot bread with soft butter and the mixed greens salad got things off to a great start and then I had the sesame encrusted salmon with mashed potatoes and fried spinich, all of which was perfectly prepared and delicious.  My 8 year-old daughter enjoyed her meal as well (grilled cheese with veggies).  For dessert, we had the Big Daddy chocolate cake, which was wonderful!  Kathy was a terrific server - very efficient and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Pecan crusted trout was out of this world....complimented with the peach salsa...great combination, Chef!!!  You hit the mark!!!  My wife had the portabella sandwich with the tater tots(what a great treat instead of regular French fries).  Our server/waiter was great..very attentive, and knowlegable.  This is on the list for a definite return........"}
{"text":"I think this is a pretty good place to go.  I have only been to the Rea Road location.  I love the pineapple martini signature drink.  Is anything spectacular?  I like the BLT salad.  I think it is great and it is perfect for sharing another person.  I don't care for the sirloin encrusted with pepper.  It is too much for me.  I love the decor.  It feels like I'm at a ski chalet."}
{"text":"My family went there last night.  Had a little bit of a wait.  It was worth it.  Coconut shrimp for an appetizer, wood grilled salmon for dinner.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! We walked in on a Friday evening and we're seated right away. Our waitress was incredibly nice the whole time, very attentive and great with our kids. All 3 adults had prime rib, and it was cooked perfectly and not super fatty. The waitress was also good recommending wine selections and food. If we were not visiting from out of town we'd definitely be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Firebirds is one of our favorite restaurants. I really love the Grilled Shrimp and Strawberries Salad and the steaks or prime rib. The food and the service are excellent. To avoid a long wait, I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"I put in the search for vegetarian and Firebirds came up. I called Firebirds and they DO NOT have a vegetarian menu"}
{"text":"Whether it's a special occasion, or in the mood for the best steak, Firebirds is never one to disappoint.  The atmosphere has multiple personalities.  Those wanted a romantic evening, to a dinner with friends, the atmosphere just seems to fit.  Okay, for romance, it might be a little loud, but once you dive into the food, who notices.  This is the place that makes Ruth's Chris taste more overpriced than good.

I learned at a business lunch in New York that if you put steak sauce on the meat, it's perceived that you don't like it.  Having learned that, I practice it in spades.  If I put something on the meat, I'm telling you that I think your meat sucks!  Never have I had the occasion to do so at Firebirds.  On the rare occasions that the meat is a little undercooked for my tastes, the manager delivers the second attempt and ensures that it's to my satisfaction.  The servers have always been very nice, and when we get one that's a little more talkative, we enjoy it that much more.  

I definitely believe that this is a \"no lose\" place for a meal that will impress anyone you choose to bless with a meal there.  Truly a 5-STAR meal and an affordable price."}
{"text":"The French dip was excellent and just right when you're not in the mood for a heavy steak meal. The fries were just the way I like them and the Cole slaw was very good. Service was great and the environment very inviting. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Simple and affordable yet quality steak house/grill. Arrived between lunch and dinner service on a Sunday afternoon...personnel was a little slow on the uptake but once I was seated the server was attentive and the manager made several passes ensuring great service even though I was a solo diner on a slow Sunday afternoon. 

Quality always consistent, I recommend the lobster queso and the sirloin salad (my faves), but I've never been disappointed with any of my selections. Thanks for taking care of me today."}
{"text":"I hate to give this restaurant this rating, however, my experience was rather disappointing. 

On 3-16-17, I had reserved seating for a party of 25. To my surprise, I was told by Mary Wentzel that I can tell her if my party grows a little, a day or two before and she would accommodate. I sent her an email that she responded to regarding my party size increasing from 25-28 people. I told them it was for my engagement dinner which was a surprise to my now fiancé. I was told we as a group had to order strictly from the group menu I had to pick out, and Mary and I established that checks would be separate, not on one bill. When we arrived they got us in pretty quickly, but when we sat down, there were only 24 chairs. I then spoke with a hostess whose name I do not have. I said to her \"Hi, I told Mary the party size was 28.\" She responded with \"No, you said 25.\" I then said \"Mary told me to email her if it grows, which I did.\" The hostess stoped listening to me near the end and said she would be right back. A man arrived and it was unclear if he was a manager. At this time I had pulled up my email to prove to them I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on them. I showed the email to the manager who responds with \"Your getting the table anyway.\" In a way that was not cordial in any manner. I was pretty upset with his tone considering this was already prearranged, and I was bringing them 28 guests at $37 a mouth!!! I was respectful the whole time, and I truly felt treated like a liar. But it became more irritating as the night went on. I had, a week prior, asked if my party can order off of the menu. I was expressly told after exhausting all options, that we must stick to the group menu, understandably. 

Later in the evening, the waiter comes up to me to say \"Party guests want to order off the menu, do you want me to charge them separately?\" I asked \"I thought we are not allowed to order off the menu?\" He said \"You can, do you want that on your bill or no?\" I then continued with \" I told Mary that it will be separate checks. We should all be charged separately.\" 

It was a night I proposed to my girlfriend, and all the planning and emailing with Firebirds was totally pointless. This caused me a lot of stress mainly due to the rude tone of the hostess and who I think was the manager. I would have also personally ordered from the menu because the group menu didn't offer what I wanted, but I already ordered when I found out I could have ordered from the menu. 

All in all, I was truly appalled by the way I was talked to. So much so, I made this yelp account over it. All I wanted was cordial respect and good food, and all I got was good food. 


EDIT* 4/15/17 

The manager called me at a convenient time and was apologetic. Once they verified my complaint was legitimate, they made up for my poor experience. They truly did make things right. Thank you Firebirds! And again, their food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have had negative and positive experiences.  The food has always been pretty good, albeit a bit expensive for what you get.  If you're into steaks and grilled fish you'll be happy- they cook them to order and fit the bill.  I've had been quality at the same price, but overall its acceptable.  Perhaps my favorite thing on the menu is the loaded backed potato.  They salt the skin and load it up with sour cream, cheese, chives, etc. It's pretty awesome.

The bar leaves a bit to be desired.  The cocktails are very syrup-y and generally fairly unauthentic.  Don't order a specialty drink like their version of the old-fashioned- its awful.  The wine list is a bit weird- there's some good stuff on the high end but the by-the-glass options are lower quality and overpriced.

The service side has been inconsistent.  I once showed up with my kids having called ahead for a table. They told me they'd have one waiting on my arrival, which was early evening on a weekend.  When I arrived they told me I'd have to join the wait queue, which was over an hour.  Not exactly what I wanted to do with 2 kids and grandparents from out of town.  So we left and had to get Chinese take-out as every other nice restaurant around this area was packed. On another visit I was seated fairly quickly and have a very personable waiter.  So I guess its a crap-shoot- you don't know how well you'll be treated.  

Overall its a pretty expensive restaurant for its inconsistent service, but the food is acceptable and its a nice environment.  Its very crowded Thur/Fri/Sat, so go very early or plan on waiting."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying i love the food at this place and have been eating here for years... that being said i'm posting this review because things have changed here big time and not for the good.  Two years ago this would be five stars all day,  The three stars are purely from nostalgia. 

i used have lunch at the bar often but due to a new job I don't have time so I have resorted to ordering togo for the last year.  As i have not eaten in house for some time this review wont speak to that experience.  I normally get the chicken pasta or the tenderloin salad... both of which used to be my favorite things ever.  The bread here is also amazing... hands down amazing.  This is where it goes down hill.  I've noticed that the portions of the pasta has gotten much smaller but the price has increased. As far as the salad its been three times in a row that the steak on my tenderloin salad has been far overcooked.  Extremely disappointed.

As for the bread... when you sit down and eat you can have as much bread as you want ... without any charge... when you get take out you will most likely receive a loaf of bread 2 hours old but if you ask for an extra you will be charged for it.   I can see this happening at olive garden but when you are paying 17 dollars for a salad I would think an extra bread would be included... not the case.  

This restaurant used to be the best place to eat on the west side... its a bit expensive but it was well worth it.  Off principal alone I will not be eating here anymore.  Increase the prices, cut down the portions on food and start gorging customers on little things like bread that are accounted for in the price of the entrees already..... great business model."}
{"text":"Had the pepper sirloin and it was on point. Ordered medium and it was a bit medium rare but great. Delicious. They said they can always happily put it on the grill if it's too bloody. The waitress was very happy, courteous and pleasant. Wanted to make sure we were happy and did not rush us at all. Very happy with the meal and the service."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner and loved the food and drinks. I had the dirty bird martini and the sesame salmon with the amazing fried spinach. We started off with the onion rings, which were done perfectly. Also had the blt salad which was good but I'd probably try a different one next time. Ended with the cheesecake, so good. Also I had mentioned in my reservation that it was our anniversary but there was no acknowledgement. Will definitely go back though."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner at this great place. My ONLY complaint (which gave it 4 stars out of 5) was that the music was WAY too loud. BUT the food and the service was fantastic. I had the fried chicken salad (one of the freshest, most crisp salads I have had in a long time). My husband loved the pecan crusted trout and the cole slaw. My mother law claimed that her stuffed bake potato was the best she's had in a very long time. Again, my only complaint was the level of the music."}
{"text":"This place has a good variety of regular food.  I've been a few times and have consistently had good service.  We ordered the lobster queso dip and chips for an appetizer (very good-big chunks of lobster) and we were working it down and as the chips got low I noticed this strange looking brown hunk of something . . .it looked like someone chopped up a horned toad.  I pointed this out to the waiter and he matter of factly said it was a dried out chunk of prime rib (LIKE THAT'S NORMAL???) because the carving station in the kitchen is right next to the chip container.  Not an alarming problem, but had to tell."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice. The food was okay for the prices they charge I expected a little more . Lobster queso was a little watery and tortilla chips tasted a little stale. Jalapeño deviled eggs were very good. I ordered the Cilantro chicken with the potatoes au gratin . The chicken I did not care for the potato side was very good. The server was very good . The restaurant was clean ."}
{"text":"Lunch is ok but pricey.  The thing that I don't like is the deceptive lunch special.

I ordered one of the \"lunch special\" on my last group mid-week lunch outing.  The waiter asked me \"what salad would you like with that?\".  He made it seems like it's part of the deal but it's not.  The price of the \"lunch special\" would ended up costing much more than a regular lunch order.  I guess Firebirds wants at least 12 bucks from you no matter what you order."}
{"text":"Update: since my review I was contacted by the manager at the Chandler location and offered gift cards to try again. We were shocked that they felt the need to give gift cards. Since then we've returned and I've got to say their steaks, especially the filet mignon, is especially delicious. Server was very friendly the second time around. And the wait time was much better for four people this time. We were extremely impressed. Definitely will be returning. We even bought gift cards for the holiday season to give to our family and friends."}
{"text":"Had our 49th anniversary lunch today at Firebirds (Stonecrest) and ordered a filet mignon, medium/rare, and it came to the table almost mooing. My husbands salmon was perfectly cooked. I asked to have my steak done the way I ordered it and the kitchen put it back on the fire. My husband likes his food hot so he proceeded to eat his meal. I sat there while my steak was re-fired. The manager, Zeke, came by and apologized for the inconvenience and offered us a free dessert for the end of our meal which was appreciated. It was several more minutes before the manager came back to our table with my steak. He asked me to check to make sure it was cooked to my desire and when I cut into the steak it was still raw inside. The manager apologized again and took the steak back to the kitchen. By this time my husband had eaten most of his meal while I was sitting there with nothing to eat but bread. The manager came to our table again and said my meal will be \"on the house\" and it will be ready soon. When I finally received my steak it was dried out from re-firing on the grill twice while cut opened. The manager came back again to the table and I explained that a good steak should never be re-fired after it has been cut opened because all the juices will be exposed to the flame and dry out. He offered to remake the steak and/or send one home with us but I declined and said I was fine. We go there quite frequently and have had several times where the steak was not prepared to medium/rare and was sent back but this time is was beyond redeeming the quality of a good steak. Yes, I will return and am still a fan of Firebirds. If it wasn't for the manager making things right by deleting the cost of my meal and the free dessert I probably wouldn't be returning there again. Firebirds did the right thing and took responsibility for the mistakes in our meal today. BTW, our waitstaff was Austin and he was extremely helpful and apologetic for the mistakes that were occurring during our visit. Hopefully next time it will be a 5 star meal..!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, perhaps the 5th time I've been to this location.  The two servers who waited on our party of twelve were top notch.  Loved the quesadilla and coconut shrimp appetizers.  My baby back rib entree was ok- I've definitely had better, for example at Chop nearby.  My buddy had the ribeye, which was similarly just ok.  I've had the salmon in the past, and the burgers which were both pretty good.  Minus 1 star for just \"good\" food.

There used to be a majestic 340-class bull elk overlooking the main dining area- loved to see him when I visited.  Was told by the server that someone wrote a letter to corporate that they were offended by him, so they took him away.  Why do we let a small group of professional whiners diminish our lives like this?   Bring the elk out of storage- stand up for something.  When our table heard this we were all upset.  Not sure I'll be back until the elk returns.  The Elephant Bar is a good alternative.   Minus 1 star for letting the crybullies win."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often and have never had a bad meal. The atmosphere is GREAT! The bar area is very inviting with the TVs and the wood burning fire place. I always feel relaxed and comfortable every time I am here. The bread they bring out pre-meal is AWESOME! the crab queso is to die for.. and as for entrees there are just too many to name. The salads are the best around chandler. Service is always very friendly, polite, and prompt.  Katie the bartender is the BEST! She is always very friendly! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  I would recommend to anyone who would like a great steak or burger.  My favorite is the smokehouse burger with smoked cheddar cheese and bbq sauce."}
{"text":"This restaurant is our favorite. My husband loves the smokehouse burger. I love their fresh salads. Their mixed greens is their house salad,yummy. I have also had the caesar salad with tenderloin, chicken, or salmon, yum. Another favorite is the filet mignon with baked potato. When i have ordered the shrimp, it is way too salty for me. The management goes out of their way to make your visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this review is not about food quality. It's an average of four star food, two star prices, and other typical dining factors.  The food at Firebirds is great, but for what I spent for two steak dinners and a few drinks my last time there with my girlfriend, it cost more than my upcoming tenth anniversary dinner cruise without the cruise.  

The waitress was excellent, but nothing special. She was a stereotypical waitress.  The restaurant itself is always busy.  In fact, last time we went we had to go elsewhere because the wait was an hour and a half.  I typically don't mind a half hour wait, which is what we ended up waiting last night, but in that time several staff members stared at us craning our necks to see a spot open at the bar without ever asking is we would like a drink or menu while we waited.  Considering how small the bar is, it is just always an issue there.

We did eventually get a table in the bar, which cut down on our wait time, but then we saw other patrons, who were just arriving, getting drinks and appetizers around the big fireplace.  Why didn't anybody ask us about doing this while we stood by the door looking rather irritated for a half hour? I am somewhat relieved that they didn't, though, because at either $5 for a beer or $9 for a liquor drink, we could have spent the entire budget at the bar in twenty minutes.

I must sound cheap or like an alcoholic, but that is not it at all.  Restaurants with congestion like this need to have options for patrons who will almost definitely have to wait.  Those options should include a light cheap appetizer menu, where the average price isn't $12, wait service for the waiting area, which already has tables for drinks, and a drink menu that will not break people before they ever sit down.  

I understand that it is near a rich area, but it's still on the fringe, and by a theater and a Wendy's.  It's not Ruth's Chris, but they sure want to pretend that it is.  In case I am just beginning to sound cheap again, let me reiterate that we could have eaten uptown at McCormick and Schmick's for the same price, and had options like the Belk Theater for dessert as opposed to Front row seats for Jurassic Park 3d across the parking lot.

My suggestion, if you plan to eat at Firebird's, is to have a reservation, be there early, ask about drinks and appetizers while you wait, because they won't offer, budget to spend around $40-$50 on two mixed drinks for two people, order a burger, because it is the only thing priced reasonably on the whole menu, then leave quickly because they don't hide that they want to free up the table after they have gotten $120 out of you.  

Bottom line, for me anyway, only go there to get burgers with friends or other couples, don't be starving because you will be starving a lot worse after the wait, and don't go there for drinks or the bar scene."}
{"text":"while the service was fast, the staff seemed pretty impersonal. I tried to start dialogue with one bartender she seemed very cold and short with her answers. i did ask for a ruby port and the bartender gave me a menu but i asked for a ruby port by the glass which there was none offered by the glass. food was pretty good they were a bit busy but with three bartenders and for the caliber of restaurant it is, they should be more personable with guess...I'll try it one more time before I call it quits. I'm single and I  look for a places where we feel comfortable about being a regular."}
{"text":"My coworkers & I wanted to find a quality restaurant where we felt like we were spending a lot of $$$$ but don't. We found this place in SouthPark. We noticed that they always try to accommodate you as efficiently as possible no matter the wait. The wait staff is magnificent, always in good spirits & never make you feel rushed. & I was impressed that I was remembered upon returning. This particular night, I had the ribeye & my companion, the ahi tuna. Neither one of us was disappointed. I actually found the ribeye to be just as good, if not better, than the higher end restaurants. It was of really good quality, seasoned to perfection, & NOT pressed (the latter is very important). There have been times when I miscommunicated how I wanted something prepared & they were always patient & eager to satisfy. And the hundreds of wine bottles on the wall for decoration... let's just say if I could execute that idea for my own home... I would!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. My wife and I were looking for a nice date night and when we looked around we found Texas road house. We walked in and instantly realized it wasn't the place to be so I walked over to firebirds and immediately without hesitation knew it was the place we wanted to eat at. We were seated right away and give our drinks and menus. We ordered the ribs and soup and our waitress actually split it for us so we could share. I can't say good enough things about how delightful their food is. It's very, very good! We definitely plan on coming back whenever we get the time off work :/ thanks again firebirds!"}
{"text":"Service is decent here.  Nothing to write home about, but efficient.  Every time I go I get the prime rib.  It is easily the best prime rib I have had in Phoenix.  Nice bar area to dine in if you prefer to watch some sports while you eat"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Everything we have ordered has tasted amazing!  Try and make reservations because it does get crowded."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what it is...steaks not selected from the best portions...not cooked the way you ask for."}
{"text":"This place is always fabulous! Happy hour is great while sitting at the bar with great martini specials and amazing crab cakes. Full meals in the dining room are always full of flavor from filet to chicken pasta. The service has always been fabulous too! Try the sangria or pineapple martini for a yummy treat!"}
{"text":"We chose Firebirds to celebrate my birthday and were comfortably seated within the nice cool interiors plushly cushioned booth seating during happy hour.  The waiter informed us to take advantage of happy hour drinks and menu we would have to move to outside patio seating (this obviously to show passing vehicle traffic that the place had diners so this was a Firebirds profit decision at diner's expense).  The bare metal chairs soon became uncomfortable and with no overhead fans, misters or a breeze we were sweating and had to talk over the sounds of passing vehicle traffic.  The Coors Light tap having been on the fritz for 2 days I ordered champagne & consumed the small glass while awaiting dinner and ordered a 2nd glass prior to the meal arriving.  The food came and our waiter failed to reappear (I assume he was distracted serving his more important inside non-happy hour customers) until we'd finished eating so the entire meal with no drink.  Soon the flies found us and were swarming all over everything then an unsmiling businesslike manager came with a much too lengthy explanation about the beer problem and blamed the outside seating requirement in the computer.  The waiter was inattentive, drinks not available and uncomfortable seating policy.  To their credit not only was the bill forgiven but we received a $50.00 gift certificate to get us back but I doubt anything will change internally!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool atmosphere here - although a few more families than I expected to see here, since it gives off that upscale casual feel.  My parents would never have spent that kind of money on my 6yr old palette and attitude.  But hey, maybe times have changed.  

Anyways, I was in town for work and staying close by so this was one of the many options around the SouthPark area.  And if you are in the mood for some steak, you should definitely stop in. 

I started a salad so loaded down with bacon that it might have well been named \"plate of bacon bits with lettuce\".  Which I'm not complaining - it was darn good.  I love bacon.  And when my steak arrived, I loved that too.  Tender and juicy but a little cool.  And yes, I ordered it rare but only the center should be cool.  Not the outside. I'm not going to dock points for that since during this particular trip to the Charlotte/Fort Mill area, I was served plenty of cool food.  Maybe it is regional thing?

The woodfire they have going in plain view of the restaurant is awesome -and smells soooooo good.  I would definitely be back here on another trip to the area!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times with my boyfriend for date night and we usually bring family/friend visitors here to eat. We have never been not satisfied with what we've ordered off the menu. The food AND drink menu is great. The quesadilla app is amazing and after trying it for the first time, the next time I ordered it as my meal. The steaks and burgers are SO tasty! Their martinis are also very good. If you aren't hungry enough for an app, keep in mind that they bring you a round loaf of bread to eat initially. Although I haven't tried nearly half the menu, I'm sure you can't go wrong ordering anything from it! There's a reason we keep going back - satisfaction every time! Also, the smell of the wood when you walk in is to die for!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend of mine decided to go here after some shopping for a late lunch, I've had friends tell me how fantastic this place was and I was in the mood for a steak, so why not. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who asked if we preferred a both or table (which I thought was nice) and then she seated us. We were seated for much too long of a time without anybody speaking to us or asking us for our drink orders, which I was disappointed in... I had heard wonderful things from friends about this place and I didn't want it to leave a bad taste in my mouth. I proceed to having to stop a server to inform her we have been sitting for awhile and nobody had spoken to us, the server was very kind... And took care of everything we needed and more! I ordered a steak and it came out perfectly. Melissa was super sweet and didn't seemed bothered by us letting her know nobody had served us. The server manger came over and apologized, saying there was a mix up... Which is understandable (I've been a server myself before) After the server manager came over, then the actual manager came over and Apologized and bought our dessert. I was very disappointed at first, but the staff was very
wonderful and took care of us... That's all I can ask in restaurant... Mistakes happen. Will def be back soon and will ask for Melissa."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite steak house. Better then Flamings and Maestros with prices that are awesome. I was concerned over the comment on noise level as I was taking my parents who are 81 and 87 years old. I called and made reservations telling them of my concern. The gave us a booth against the wall and my Dad did great. 

Don't waste your money anywhere else if you want steak."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant.  I love dining at nice restaurants, and Firebird's was a very enjoyable experience.  Their Aspen steak ($20) is every bit as good as steaks I've ordered from Ruth's Chris and Flemmings ($40-50).   

We also ordered the seared Ahi tuni appetizer...which was also great.  My girlfriend ordered the french dip sandwhich and loved it.  They were very busy (we went a couple days before Christmas), but the waitress seemed to be omnipresent and had no trouble keeping up our table.  

I will be returning to Firebirds again as soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food! We had the house sirloin, which came with bread, a salad and steak fries. The BLT salad was great! The bread was so good and fresh baked. The sirloin and steak fries were excellent and cooked to perfection. And the best part was that it was only $15 between the hours of 4pm and 6pm Monday through Thursday. Our server was superb! She was so on top of things. I was very impressed and will be back!"}
{"text":"I was here for a weekday lunch with a friend.  We sat outside.  Service was good.

I had the pecan crusted trout, which was great, and the accompanying slaw was good too.  The complimentary bread (even though it's healthier, I hate that most restaurants don't do this anymore) would have sufficed as a carb portion, but I splurged on the sweet potato waffle fries.  Yum!

I would definitely return for dinner, should I be in the mood for nice, normal, american fare."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday last month. Booked a reservation from their website and was seated on time. Waiter was very knowledgeable and food was delicious."}
{"text":"Love the tender steak. Everything is so flavorful! I would deff come here everyday if I have the money to!!! Love love love love"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place was great fast and really good which is always great when you are on break the salads are delicious and the martinis are really tasteful here!  Plus the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent service, phenomenal food, and great atmosphere.  I'd order the Delmonico steak every week if I lived here, and this would be my ace in the hole for date night with my wife.  These guys have it figured out."}
{"text":"My Mom and I went in for lunch after spending a few hours dress shopping. We were seated immediately and met our server Jen, right away. We were unsure of what wine to choose and Jen recommended the house chardonnay and brought us samples of it along with another choice. We were very happy with her knowledge of the wine list and good recommendation. Our food came promptly and was delicious. I had the wicked burger. It was cooked perfectly and I would definitely get it again. My mom had the french dip. She's always on the look out for a good one and said this was one of the best! Lots of prime rib and good au jus. We both had the tator tots which were super crispy but light on the inside. The side green salad with spiced pecans was also a nice choice. 

The food was delicious but I rated our visit 5 stars because of the great service by Jen, our waitress. She was super nice and attentive, all the best qualities of a good server. Would go back and ask for her every time!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the best restaurant I have ever been to. My fiancé and I have been about 10 times and have never once had a bad experience. We both have worked in the customer service industry for a long time and honestly I think other businesses should model after Firebirds.  The food is amazing. I usually get the peppercorn steak which is the best I've ever had and he gets the burger. The cheesecake is the best!!! I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. You can tell the staff truly enjoys their job and everyone helps each other out like family. I would recommend this place to anyone. 

I have to say one last thing. I celebrated my birthday/engagement party there the staff made a design of a ring on my plate and said congrats, and several of the staff came by and congratulated me. How thoughtful! We will be long time customers for sure! Thank you for being a great business."}
{"text":"Newest location in South Park.  Amazing decor. A+++
Same menu as Rea Road location.
Only complaint:  Take your thumbs out of my food when delivering it to the table."}
{"text":"I like Firebirds.  It is was it is.  Nice environment, reasonable food.  Servers are usually pretty good.  Bartenders are always dead on.
Only complaint.... PLEASE take your thumb out of my food when delivering it!!!  Use a tray if you have to.
New location is beautiful too."}
{"text":"Excellent experience here recently on my first visit. Food was good. Service was excellent. Staff helped each other out. Never had to ask for anything as the server offered and supplied refills condiments boxing of food etc. Would return."}
{"text":"Went out to Firebirds last night with my friends. Service was excellent, Decore of the restaurant was impressive.
Good restaurants for special occasions"}
{"text":"My husband and I took my in-laws here on a recommendation by a work friend.

I felt I was in a barn lodge!

We all ordered various fish entrees, and we all thought all fishes were bland. It was like they were all baked in a convection oven. No seasoning, not even a hint of flavor from olive oil or butter.

It seemed way overhyped for the experience in the end."}
{"text":"Firebirds is a mans restaurant. Dark wood, soaring stone fireplaces and attractive servers. The bar is a heavy black granite with dark wood accents. 

Businessmen and corporate American Expresses are abundant, as is the selection of bourbons and gins. I like to have a dirty beefeater Martini with their blue cheese stuffed olives. They have a pretty nice wine list, which is half off on mondays. The beer list is lacking, your basic Blue Moon, Sam Adams, Stella selection. 

The menu centers around meat entrees, and most entrees come with a loaded baker. One of the best loaded baked potatos I've had. One complaint: the entrees do not come with a salad. For the price of most things, a salad is needed to justify it. 

This is one of those restaurants I like to go to alone, sit at the bar, drink too much and have a big steak....go home and have the best nights sleep ever."}
{"text":"The service was great.  We built a great rapport with our server and were given choices off the menu recommendations.  We took him up on two of them. 

The food was amazing!  We had the lobster spinach dip, bleu cheese fillet with green chili Mac and cheese and salmon with green chili Mac and cheese.  Then we had the coffee drink (special) - and YUMMY!

I have always enjoyed everything I've ordered.  I've had things as simple as the tortilla soup and salads."}
{"text":"Just driving by and had the hunger bug, let's stop and get a snack... Busy place, but a ball game was just getting out, but who cares if there is a short wait, the weather was perfect.

Reasonable size menu, but not overwhelming, I find some of the better places have menus of items than specialize in... Well this is that place. What a great find, staff is friendly and most important the food is amazing.

Fish, crab cakes, steak, melt in your mouth and tasty. Wait time for food was just right, and even though they were very busy, the service was attentive, quality was spot on.

The only thing that holds back the fifth star is the prices, some what high compared to similar in Phoenix the food and environment is 5 stars all the way, and the price will not deter me from coming back. Hope next time you are in Peoria you stop by and give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Ballantyne. The service is always spectacular and the steaks are on par with the nicest steakhouses in Uptown. If you haven't tried the Pineapple infused Vodka.. you need to do that immediately! It is amazing. Parking can be an issue, but they now have valet at night which has made it much easier. Only drawback is on weekends you are going to be waiting a LONG time for a table, and they struggle a bit with estimating wait times. But definitely one of the best places to go if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was great. We both had sesame encrusted salmon with potatoes and fried spinach. All were excellent. It was my first fried spinach and it was surprisingly good. Joey provided friendly and attentive service and the manager came by to see if everything was satisfactory.  It is not cheep but worth the price.  I would highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a \"nice lunch out\" here recently and we were very pleased.  This is a fairly simple menu, well executed.

For context:
1)  Normally, if we spend real money on a meal out, we go to places that cook things we could not easily cook at home.  I can buy and grill steak, burgers, etc perfectly well on my own.  But...
2)  Sometimes, we want to eat a nice meal out, but have to take the children (9 and 6) with us (not my first choice for a nice meal to be sure, but you gotta eat)... which can be a really tricky act.  They like to go out, but they're not THAT well behaved... and some restaurants make this work and some really, really don't.  And it's often VERY hard to tell what'll 
do and what won't.  BUT you also have to be careful with \"kid-friendly\" or you'll get Chuck E Cheese - money I'd rather not spend.

So, we ventured out with children in tow and total of three adults....
Food at our table included:
Lobster Spinach Queso (very nice!)
Chicken Tortilla Soup
Caesar Salad
French Dip
Smokehouse Burger
..and children ate grilled cheese and chicken strips - with homemade lemonade (a very nice touch) which was reported to be excellent.

All were flawlessly executed in ample portions (I was full hours later, no dinner necessary).  The atmosphere is upscale casual - a great balance of \"new and expensive\" with \"relaxed and inviting\".  Service was on point - prompt and friendly but not overly familiar.  The wood grill and open kitchen set up provides a nice interest point and a wonderful (not overpowering) aroma and ambience.

Great meal, be sure you're hungry and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of hype about this place and expected a high end steakhouse atmosphere.  It isn't that, but the food was good and staff was friendly.  My fish was cooked well but there was nothing especially memorable about the dishes we had.
I wouldn't be opposed to returning but I won't go out of my way to get back."}
{"text":"Love the menu! Last visit had the Colorado Chicken Salad...amazingly superb. Add a dirty martini and you are good to go...to the movies across the street, just a few steps away! Yum and Fun!"}
{"text":"Worked at Firebird's in Raleigh for five years while in college.  Why?  Because the food at this restaurant is fantastic.  No reason to go to the fanciest steakhouses if you are a beef lover.  Although not the cheapest, they do everything that the pricey places do, at a much better price.  Service is above average as they train their waitstaff well.  The place gets busy for a good reason."}
{"text":"Short wait time for a table. Ambience is a bit noisy, but friendly. We had the best server, Sara. My NY strip was perfect. It was Monday so 1/2 off wine. Yippee! Great baked potato, tasty salad. My hubby had prime rib and ate it all! No room for dessert tonight, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Wine Down Monday!  1/2 priced wines on Monday - nice Pinot on special.  Like this location better than Rea Road - quieter - hostess sat us quickly and efficiently.  Waitress was excellent - only complaint and it has happened more often than not - upon opening the red wine, they try to push the cork back into the bottle!!!  We always wait until they leave and then remove the cork but that would be part of the wine presentation course!  Like they do not serve wine at room temperature - coming from California I was astonished upon moving here how many of the upscale places serve red wine at room temperature - slightly chilled please!  Manager came over to make sure all was good - food was served quickly and exactly as ordered"}
{"text":"Food was ok...salad was great.  Their music was too loud and that caused everybody to talk louder!  I am not going to Firebirds to listen to piped-in music.  Annoying, even after asking the waitress to lower the volume."}
{"text":"Firebirds has a somewhat limited menu.  As many people know, this can be a good thing if the food the restaurant specializes in is amazing.  Based on that mentality, Firebirds bills itself as specializing in steak, since those are the main items on the menu.  Unfortunately, the steak isn't fantastic.  It's not bad by any means, but it just isn't that great.  I had the prime rib but was disappointed in the lack of flavor.  Something is just missing, and the au jus doesn't salvage much.  We also had the filet mignon (also bland?!).  The one thing I can say is that the pre-dinner bread is really good - so that gets them a star (sad if the bread is their saving grace, isn't it?).  

The service was friendly and the decor is nice.   This overall made for a nice evening out.  It's also conveniently near the Chandler Fashion mall.  The price is on the steep side, but that's not surprising since their primary entree is steak.

Would I go back?  Probably not.  Some of the cheaper steak chain restaurants have better food."}
{"text":"First visit here was great! Had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. Hubby had the trout and I ordered the coconut shrimp. Both were tasty. Hubby had forgotten to order mashed potatoes, and when he mentioned it to the waitress she brought it out at no charge. The rockstar dish of the night had to be the spinach and lobster dip! Service was pleasant, except that our waitress disappeared a bit at the end. It was a busy night, so no big. We definitely plan on visiting again!"}
{"text":"Service ... always great
Food ... always poorly cooked 

I'm a huge fan of this chain.  Love that wood taste.  And their warm bread with olive oil is phenomenal.  But this location is horrendous.  Does not matter if it's busy or slow, their chefs simply don't know how to cook.  Each time I've been here I've returned something. 

Here are my past three visits
Visit 1 : ordered hamburger well done and cilantro chicken. Hamburger arrives medium and chicken raw
Visit 2:  ordered two different styles of hamburger,  both well done. Same style of burger arrives but cooked right. 
Visit 3: 2 Caesar salads and cilantro chicken.  Cilantro chicken arrived like a rubber. 

I'll probably continue to visit but I think at every visit I'll need to scare them a bit and tell them about my recent experiences."}
{"text":"My mom really likes this restaurant. The food is good and a variety of options. 

This visit I had a \"dirty bird\" martini (ok I had two of them- watch out because they are awesome and you will want another one!) and the friend chicken salad and the featured dessert. Mom had a steak and baked potato and mushrooms, and then an after dinner coffee. 

The bar is open and upbeat and fun to grab a drink in. 

Tips: you can grab a table in the bar and get served there. Or go online and get a reservation."}
{"text":"Went there with my family and what a mistake that was. Burnt burgers with no taste, slow service, waitress kept getting sidetracked and it took forever to get her attention for a refill on our drinks. Next time I think we'll just go to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  Meatloaf and veggies were great.  Service was spot on and the entire staff was very friendly.  Will go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Anlässlich eines Besuches des Enkelkindes in den USA waren wir mit 6 Personen dort essen. Ja, Firebirds ist eine kleine aber überschaubare Kette. Aber sie wird betriben von Eigentümern die was vom Fach verstehen. Das Interieur ist rustikal ohne aufdringlich zu sein, viel grobes Holz und offenes Feuer. Der Service gewohnt amerikanisch aufmerksam und schnell - ohne aufdringlich zu sein. Wie immer ist der Geräuschpegel etwas zu hoch aber das ist in den USA nun mal so. Die Hörgeräte Akustiker wollen schließlich auch leben :-) Das Essen: perfekt! Ich hatte als Vorspeise gegrillte Reisengarnelen und dann ein mit Bacon umwickeltes und dann gegrilltes Filet vom Rind. Davon hätte ich ein Kilo essen können, so köstlich war es. Dazu einen Chardonnay aus USA probiert, der war der Mode entsprechend Barrique ausgebaut, passte aber seltsamerweise gut zum Fleisch. Hier in Europa würde ihn wohl keiner mögen. Auch den anderen Mitessern hat es bestens geschmeckt! Wer nach Charlotte kommt ist hier bestens aufgehoben! Nicht preiswer - aber das ist Essen gehen in den USA schon lange nicht mehr."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner. Everyone in my family enjoyed their meal. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and bar, and we had other servers helping to make sure our drinks were always full. The mostimpressive part of our meal was that my girlfriend  and I split two meals and the two meals were already separated on two plates. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for drinks and the bartenders are always quick and nice. 

Had food for the first time and it was awesome. Ordered a burger which was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. Hard to beat that for $11. 

The manager stopped by and checked on us and asked how the meal was. Great service all around! Strongly suggest checking out the burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My husband and I were looking for a new place to celebrate our anniversary this year, and we were so happy that we chose Firebirds to celebrate #15!

We had reservations for 7:00 pm and we were seated immediately. Our table was comfortable and our waitress arrived quickly to take our drink orders and bring hot bread.

I ordered the Spinach Salad and Pecan Crusted Trout with Mango Salsa. Heaven on a plate! Everything was delicious and with generous helpings. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Great Service.  Very friendly and inviting staff.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service. Better than Flemings or The Keg and it's better priced. Try the salmon! It's a new fav for us!"}
{"text":"Dropped by the Northlake mall FB based on reviews. Parker and team of bartenders made it us feel welcome. Was over hour wait for table so we were luck to find two seats together at the very nice bar. 

Ordered kobe meatloaf wit green beans and mashed potatoes everything came out quite fast given the busy kitchen. Obviously the chef and staff are good here. 

Enjoyed my fist experience at FB. Would return. Mary was also good at the bar. Thanks parker and mary."}
{"text":"This place is busy on Friday nights, and they offer call ahead seating.  Definitely do this, as we waited about 30 minutes.  

I had coconut shrimp, which was good, and had a lot more shrimp than I was expecting.  They are good about substituting the side dishes.  A friend who lives in the area took us here because the portions are always good enough to have leftovers.  He enjoyed his buffalo meatloaf with portabello mushrooms.  My fiancee had some sort of pasta with chicken and asiago.  I later learned it was cold and too spicy.  As we were somebody's guest, it was better to not complain.  

The bread was good, but they didn't bring more.  I suppose we could've asked.  The server seemed upset because we didn't order alcohol.  The food came out quickly.  The place is a little loud, but has nice decor."}
{"text":"Best steak in Ballantyne, they have fantastic food and always great service. Usually a wait but,  well worth the price."}
{"text":"Returned here after a year's absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"}
{"text":"Best BLT salad! Steak is amazing. I love this place. I like that the quality of food is not overpriced like some other steakhouses."}
{"text":"Wow!  These reviews are shocking.  Maybe I just went on a bad afternoon.  I'm not going to say how bad the food was, but instead I'm going to try it again - just to see if its me, or the food!

Well the fried spinach tasted like sheets of greased toilet paper (if you can imagine that) and the mash potatoes had a stronger metalic after taste.  Everything about the potatoes said \"don't eat me!\".  The fish wasn't too bad, however.  
The waitress stood right behind me and was bascially shouting in my ear, so much so that I moved my seat.
But its a real cute place, and the wine was excellent!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and every time the service is impeccable.   They have a great Happy Hour with a nice patio out back to relax.  Inside, the dining area is very nice and the quality of the meals are fabulous.  I highly recommend their salads, burgers, and chicken cilantro dish."}
{"text":"This is one of my top favorite restaurants. The Sesame Encrusted Salmon is the best meal ever.  Accompanied with the BLT salad. I also substitute the mashed potatoes with the  au gratin potatoes.  Yum!"}
{"text":"A favorite for the family - if you call ahead and don't have to wait.  Always a solid meal.  Don't go for a gourmet experience, go for a great steak and their best dish - a regular old baked potato that they somehow make into something great.  Salads are good as well.  Service is OK, perhaps closer to a chain than a high end restaurant but you never get ignored and problems are dealt with swiftly.  My kids love the \"Big Daddy\" chocolate cake."}
{"text":"this is my all-time favorite restaurant. i go every year for my birthday and order the filet.
 the service is always phenomenal! our most recent waitress was from california (i don't remember her name) but she made small talk with us and seemed genuinely glad to be taking care of us. a few of the line cooks i had previously worked with at romano's maraconi grill (which has since closed down) were cooking. she kindly walked me up to the line to say hi!
the filet is always cooked to perfection (or should i say not-so-cooked; i like mine still mooing) and be sure to add the green bean side for only $5. they're cinnamon-sweet! i usually go for the key lime pie as dessert, but recently i chose the creme brulee cheesecake. heaven in my mouth."}
{"text":"Mediocre food + slow service = 2 stars

FOOD:
Food was nothing special.  If you're looking for a place to wow your tastebuds; look elsewhere. 

SERVICE:
Arrived at 130pm; restaurant was not busy at all. It took about 30 minutes for two salad entrees...seriously...30 minutes for two salads."}
{"text":"Firebirds is a restaurant I frequent about once a month. It has an excellent location, right in the Stonecrest shopping center, which makes it convenient if you're out shopping or going to see a movie. The food is always pretty good and the quality is consistent. I like the lobster queso appetizer and their steaks the best. My husband is a fan of the french dip and the ribs. The inside of the restaurant is impressive. The main dining area has an impressively high ceiling and a nice ambience. It's someplace that is perfect for a date night or girl's night out."}
{"text":"There is something for everyone, healthy, and tasty. I take my clients here often and end up eating here 2-3 times a week. I can always try something new, and be happy with it."}
{"text":"The prime rib is among the best I've ever had. I love the atmosphere, especially the patio on a night with fire. Good wine, great HH, nice place!"}
{"text":"Great Filet and Baked patato. Service is always good."}
{"text":"I went here with family that came into town from Texas and wanted a nice steak. I ordered my steak rare because most places overcook the meat but not here! The steak was exactly how I love it. The loaded potato that comes with it is rolled in salt which made the outside of the potato hard to eat but I know now to ask for that to be taken off. 

The service was great and if the patio is available, ask to sit out there because it is much quieter atmosphere than the inside. 

Will go again in the future when the family comes back into town."}
{"text":"Free Bread! Score. About the only score...

Based on the two experiences i would say a third is not likely. 

First Visit: Order lobster appetizer... which was mediocre. Prime Rib was not too bad... but for 10$ more you can have amazing Prime rib else where. The meatloaf.. i would have to say was amazing... Service was as good as it could be sitting on the patio.

Second Visit: Lunch. Not the best place for lunch. We had a French Dip... which after the bill came we learned was $16.00... if my High School served french dips.. it would have been better. Based on other Yelp reviews i tried the BLT salad with chicken breast... how can a BLT salad with Ranch be bad? It cant. 

Overall... Dinner might be ok if you want to spend some bucks... but nothing great over here."}
{"text":"I love the restaurant & ambiance which is why I gave them a shot several times but these cooks do not know how to cook a steak to temperature! Every single time I order a filet they want to butterfly it, a sin itself, make me wait 40 mins, only to serve an over-cooked steak. It's completely ridiculous a steakhouse can't cook a steak! The very last time I was there they served my bacon wrapped filet, cut in half, horizontal so the filet was only a quarter inch thick with the bacon served on the side. What a disgrace! Then the manager only comped the steak which I didn't even eat anyway. I've given up & will not return."}
{"text":"The smokehouse burger is awesome and so are the coconut shrimp. Service is always top notch. Great ambiance.  Always and enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We're from New England and the crab cakes are among the best. The wicked burger was really good too."}
{"text":"Yum! Colorado Chicken Salad with Raspberry Lime Vinaigrette is a must. Superb salad every time. Great service. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really wish they would get their act together. I love the food when it's done properly. Two years in a row we've gone here for my birthday dinner and they have managed to screw it up in one way or another. I will not let this happen a third year. Bad enough dinner was late but then to be lied to by the manager is just unacceptable. I don't care if you pay for my dinner it doesn't make it right. You're in the service business people make mistakes own up to your mistakes John."}
{"text":"Best steak in town.  Get there early on Friday or Saturday because this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Crowded all the time so I had trouble hearing my friends sometimes... But food is great. Top favorite will be strawberry shrimp salad. Great summer food!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here this evening...very pleased with both the service and food.  Our waiter, Phillip, was kind and efficient. Always anticipated our needs. Will be coming back soon!!!

BTW BLT salad rocks!"}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant. Between 4-6 there is an early bird dinner available. 
The food is delicious. My only complaint is that half-priced drinks are only available in the bar area or patio. We had our dinner in the bar area and there was not enough room for our plates. They were hanging over the edge of the tiny table and we had to move the candle and S & P onto the window sill. Please change this rule so guests can dine at regular tables and have half-priced drinks between 4-6."}
{"text":"I usually am at Firebirds for lunch, so I love that the service is quick and they understand the need to be in and out. I love most everything on the menu, but my #1 is the lobster quest. I can't even explain how much I love this appetizer - like I could lick the bowl I love it so much. I also love the ahi tuna appetizer and the shrimp and strawberry salad. 

The atmosphere is great - not too loud or bright. Love the decor and the bar area."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to dinner here on Friday night. Service was excellent and special thanks to Russ the manager for helping us out with our table. 

For eats we both had the steak with veggies, both of which were prepared perfectly. 

Well worth the wait and great value for the money.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Samantha was our server, she was excellent and attentive! The food was phenomenal! Had the primed rib.... It's pricey, but so worth it. I would go back just because the service was so very good."}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood bar and grill.  Nothing will blow you away but you won't be disappointed.  The food is surprisingly good, and the service is pretty good.  Fairly pricey for the genre, but a good place for a casual business lunch.  I recommend the ribeye sandwich, and the salads are good as well."}
{"text":"The worst food I ever taste. The serving side was low I had to go to another restaurant to get full. I took appetizer and dinner.  I was so sorry I took all this the food that was lousy and the portion was small. I went with my friends and family thought they would have a nice time eat a full meal but I thought wrong.  The service wasn't great. The waiter felt she was forced to do her job. I wish she gets a better job not working at Firebirds Wood Fired Grill.
I am contemplating if I should go again but most are saying no. 
Don't know if another try is needed.
Also don't take the Wood Salmon or any fish."}
{"text":"I had out-of-state coworkers in town who were looking for a great steak place, so I suggested Firebirds.  

I didn't partake in the wine list, but those that did said the wine list had a lot of great selections, and everyone was very happy with the wine they selected.

The bread that comes out before the meal is heavenly.  It was light, but crusty on the outside and super tasty.  

For entrees, I chose the prime rib.  It was delish!  I asked for the end cut (which they had!) and it was perfect.  It comes with a small side of au jus and creamy horseradish (I asked for regular horseradish which they also provided). I opted for the sweet potato waffle fries, which were crispy and sweet. 

The hit of the night was the Blue Cheese Fillet.  I few people ordered that, and I almost thought they were going to lick their plate at the end. It was covered in blue cheese and mushrooms, which apparently were to die for! 

Other dishes we had were Salmon, a Chicken Pasta and another steak. Everyone raved about their meals.    

Everyone gave a resounding thumbs up on the recommendation."}
{"text":"Yay, is right!  I was not disappointed in any way and I am tuff to please.  I come from a 4 star restaurant background and this restaurant is definitely one of the better restaurants in town!
I was pleasantly surprised and the presentations (how the food was presented) were excellent.
I will definitely return.  The Price should probably be $$$ instead of $$ but it is worth it.  Try it, I am sure you will like it."}
{"text":"Portions are much too large, that may explain why everything on the menu seems a little overpriced.  The environment is cool, ir reminds of of a lodge inside.  I didn't think the food was as great as I expected for the price.  Average food ...."}
{"text":"The interior looks awesome and sets a really good atmosphere for dining.  Ordered the steak and shrimp.  OMG.  It would be my last meal if I had to make a choice.  The service was fantastic and professional.  Only bad thing is its very high priced.  However, it's not over-priced for the service and quality of food you receive.  So if you want a cheap steak go to Dennys or something, but if you want a really good hunk of meat for the extra price here is the place to go."}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat but I tried the sirloin and bacon n blue cheese filet and they were both fantastic. I got sesame crusted salmon that was burnt and shouldn't have left the kitchen. The server and manager both corrected the problem and my second attempt was very tasty. We sat at a bar table n the ambiance  was still intimate. 
Fried spinach tastes like crispy grease - really gross. I recommend subbing (try the green beans)
I'd definitely go back but schedule reservations ahead."}
{"text":"My husband and I were celebrating an anniversary.  We ma de the mistake of going on a Saturday night of a three-day weekend.  The restaurant was crowded and very noisy.  It is a popular place so we were not surprised and chalked it up to our poor timing.  We waited in the bar for our table, and I have to say, the service was fast and courteous.  Our drinks were delivered quickly, and the server came back several times to make sure our needs were met.  Dinner was just so-so.  My husband ordered the Ribeye steak medium rare.  He was advised it would be warm and pink/red in the middle.  When it came, it was almost raw.  Again, the service was great--a manager was right there when he first cut into it and quickly took it back for more cooking.  The baked potato accompanying it was cold--the butter did not melt in it and the sour cream clumped into cold bits.  I had the braised beef pasta, which was good but not great.  Our server was prompt, courteous, and available for our every need.  Bottom line, service was very good, but our food was so-so.  The acoustics in the restaurant add to excessive noise when it is crowded.  We may go back to give it one more try, but not soon."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I had the pecan crusted trout, it was so good. The drinks were a little high to me but so good, it was worth it! The waiter was so nice and helpful. I will definitely come back. He also told us the drinks are half off on Wednesdays! Love the atmosphere, food, service! I would recommend this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"Awesome service and delicious food you can't resist. Steak is awesome. We will already come back. Tons of wine choice but I am a beer drinkinger
After all my experience with this join is more than 5 starts. Server just put spoon on the table for next meal - that is dirty and unprofessional, my good experience went down with waiter's ignorance and don't care about customers. I am very pleased by this restaurant how they deal with customer complaints- instead of viewing as complaints, they actually view as the point to improve. I have not returned to the restaurant but I don't mind giving them a second chance. We usually go to Durant but maybe someday we return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was sooo good! Great place for steaks, they also have a good wine selection. Service was respectful and prompt. GO THERE NOW!!"}
{"text":"Great filet. Good green beans. Easy. Nice atmosphere. The chicken with pineapple salsa was very nice and light with a good char."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was even better; our waitress Andrea was excellent. Prime Rib was outstanding. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte for the weekend. We made reservations that evening for dinner on a Friday night. They have a call ahead wait list which is very nice. the restaurant is very modern and clean. The service was wonderful. My chili rubbed Rob Delmonico steak could be cut with a fork, it was delicious! The Parmesan mashed potatoes are a fabulous side. My spinach salad was delicious.  they have a good wine selection, and all very reasonably priced for the quality of food we received."}
{"text":"Ok, so to be honest, the evening started a little rough but,.... the manager actually caught it! We started on the bar area with no service,  moved to regular seating during Queens Fest ..a free apitizer with apologies. ... great wait staff with Chelsea giving wine selection with knowledge. ... Regular yummy salads. Overall,  great 32nd anniversary celebration."}
{"text":"Loved my visit here. I was talked into the meatloaf for dinner. I have never ordered meatloaf at a restaurant, but tonight I did. The combination of meatloaf, and a bit of mashed potatoes and gravy on my fork......HEAVEN. I was sure to chew in every corner of my mouth....my taste buds were going crazy......."}
{"text":"We have been going to Firebirds for years.  Used to be there was never a wait, but then the word got around and it's crowded quite a bit.  Oh well.  Doesn't stop us!  Love this place!  Steaks are great, Port mushrooms?  Yup!  Spiced Green Beans?  Oh yeah.  The BLT salad rocks, you name it, it's good.  The service has always been great from the hostess to the wait staff.  If I could only go to one place the rest of my life, this would have to be it (but only because Pizzaria Bianco doesn't serve steak!)."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest, nicest, well decorated restaurants. I think it is specialized in steaks, and since I am not steaks fan I went with the a burger. I am glad I did, it is one of the best burgers I had in my LIFE, specially with the wood fired bread (try the BLT burger). I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok. So I'm not big on dining in large corporate style restaurants. I usually find the food to be mediocre. Service to be fake. Mgmt to be poor.
But...
We were desperate to find a place to eat in Chandler on a Monday night being that most of the small biz restaurants are closed Sundays and Mondays...so after driving around for 30 minutes we decided to give this place a try.
We walked in greeted by a friendly hostess. Seated and greeted under a minute literally; and we were even more pleased to find that on Monday nights they offer half off all wines (except the reserve list).
Our server Dan was THE BEST Server!!!  Very friendly, informative, and knowledgeable.  You can sense that he cares to be at work.  Management seemed to be just as caring. They noticed we needed a box for our food so instead of telling Dan or the busser to get it for us they handed it themselves.  (I can't stand it when I see managers in restaurants pointing fingers here and there)
The food was delicious too.  My husband had the prime rib and I had the cheeseburger (i know, cliche, but i was craving one) and we shared a bottle of Stags Leap Petite Syrah for half price!! Couldn't make it for dessert but maybe next time.
I will definitely return and hope to be seated in Dan's section!"}
{"text":"*********PRICEY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT**************

The food is OK ...... not outstanding.
The Wait staff ....... is a bit above average.
The menu .......... they believe they're akin to Morton's Steak House.
       Salad is EXTRA
       Average entree price $21
My peppered crusted sirloin was $20.50
*********The steak was TOUGH & CHEWY...... FIT FOR A BEAVER.***************
 
Would I come back, for another try ????????
..........not unless I had a pet Beaver.

{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte! My go-to meals are the Delmonico steak sandwich, shrimp BLT salad, or the chicken BLT salad. I've never had anything bad here! Smoked chicken wings and \"ranch rings\" are the best!"}
{"text":"We visited Firebirds for the first time yesterday, and had a wonderful experience. We dined midday between the lunch and dinner crowds and enjoyed a quiet meal in a fairly empty venue. It smells delicious inside! I wonder if they pipe in that smoky smell or if it's truly wafting from that kitchen? The interior is well appointed, clean, and shows pride in this franchise. I ordered the Surf & Turf (which I was CRAVING) with the BLT salad, and stole more than my fair share of crisp, mouthwatering tater tots from my husband's plate. The filet was prepared a perfect medium rare and melted in my mouth. It's bacon-wrapped with light seasoning that doesn't distract from the natural flavor of the cut. The lobster tail is substantial in size - more than expected - tender, not overly seasoned, and had a slightly smoked flavor. Our young server Lulu was attentive, offered helpful suggestions, and was quite patient & accommodating as we made a multitude of substitutions when we ordered due to dietary considerations. Our glasses were never empty and every request was met with gracious politeness. Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu which offers a variety of selections without becoming overwhelming. The GM stopped by our table to chat - which is always a nice touch. We will definitely come back next time I crave Surf & Turf. It was well priced at around $40 and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Amazing ribeye steak. And I recommend the blt salad. Really like the open kitchen too"}
{"text":"Above and Beyond - their Catering Manager Michelle is amazing, I can't wait to meet her in person. I called on Thursday for a large catering order on Friday on behalf of my company for an employee who is grieving. She said normally they require 24 hours notice, but since a death in the family is never planned they could make an exception and help us out. She was great with food suggestions, patient while we figured out payment methods and pick-up arrangements. When my co-worker went to pick up the order she said Michelle was happy, pleasant and had everything ready. My review is based on my interaction with Michelle only, as I haven't actually eaten there, but my interaction was good enough to make me want to try it! Thanks Michelle!"}
{"text":"From one of our Parents of Allergic Kids members:\"Just wanted to share we just left Firebirds in stonecrest. They were fabulous with allergies. Everything has to go by the manager first. He said yesterday they had another customer and they used different pans and different parts of the kitchen because he had so many allergies. I was very impressed and I am very careful
and skeptical of places.\""}
{"text":"Got medium-rare filet right. That's what matters most in a steakhouse rating. It was busy for an early Sunday dinner, but they fit us right in. I would not hesitate to go back to this place, if I ever come back to Charlotte. Decent pricing and good variety on the menu."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic Steakhouse, and one that is highly recommended. The decor and atmosphere are both great, and the music is very good  as well. All the food was excellent: the steaks were cooked perfectly and were both tender and highly flavorful. Dessert was very tasty as well. The real highlight was the service, however.  Our server was fantastic: both very helpful and highly attentive to our table. She kept our drinks filled constantly, was able to offer good menu advice, and assisted with finding menu options for one of our party with allergies. We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"After leaving my wife and I agreed it was the best bad service we had ever received. The food was all great and our server was extremely nice and attentitive. The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is that they forgot to bring us our crab cakes for our appetizer until we mentioned it when they brought the meal out. They gave us the crab cakes on the house and apologized. Then when we asked for our leftovers in a box they threw my wife's leftovers away by mistake and only gave me my leftovers. It was especially bad because wife had a large pasta dish that she ate maybe 25% of, but she enjoyed it so it was annoying when it all got thrown away. Overall, the food was great and everyone we encountered was nice, but our waitress was extremely spacey to say the least."}
{"text":"We went at 2:00 on a Sunday and service was so amazingly slow. The food was good, but it took an hour to arrive after ordering. Our glasses were always empty and we didn't have any indication of when our food would arrive. It shouldn't take an hour and a half to get in and out on a slow Sunday afternoon for two people. Management didn't even notice our frustration or apologize."}
{"text":"Since we live near Chandler Mall, this happens to be one place we frequent about once a week....sometimes more (ok, we eat out a LOT!).  I have never had a bad meal here.  The place has a great wood smoked smell inside and it's a bit dark inside, which I kind of like and provides a nice atmosphere.  They have an open kitchen so you know your food hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 min.  During the winter, the bar inside is great, as it has a huge fireplace and an inviting atmosphere to partake in some cocktails.  The outdoor patio also has a fireplace and a great place to sit when it's not too hot.  

So what should you order there?  Here are my favorites, depending on your mood:

The filet wrapped in bacon is a delicious staple at Firebirds.  The meat is tender and always cooked perfectly (I like mine medium rare +).

Wood grilled salmon - some of the best salmon I have had!  LOVE the flavor of the wood.

Ahi tuna appetizer - if you're going light and like ahi, I highly recommend this from the starter menu.  The mustard sauce they serve with it has a mighty big kick and is one of my favorites.  I've tried to recreate it at home, without success. 

Green beans as a side option - ohhhh I know what you are thinking!!  Green beans? Yuck.  I'll get something else.  Well, everything is good but the green beans are the BEST!  They are sauteed with pecans and a little butter and they are soooo delicious.  You won't know it's a veggie!! 

As far as a chain restaurant goes, this is a top pick for me.  Check it out!!  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Firebirds is a pretty good steakhouse, and while our visit wasn't perfect, it was quite good.

I ordered the sirloin cooked medium rare, and the steak was red and juicy. The steak fries tasted a bit funny, like the cooking staff used too much grease, but they were still pretty good. My father's ribs were really good, though the half rack order only comes with six (generally I believe it's seven or eight for a half rack order). My mother was disappointed her tortilla soup came out cold, but enjoyed it. 

The service was quite good; when we had problems with the temperature, the waiter went and got the manager to turn the temperature down. Plus the waiter was a nice kid (save for his tendency to hard sell on the drink/dessert menu just a bit). The ambiance is nice as well;  it's in a mall but hard to tell, and the fireplace is a nice touch. My parents really like this place as an upscale place to spend holidays (like New Year's Eve) and I think it's a pretty good steakhouse as well."}
{"text":"This place ought to be called the salt palace. Tonight was the third time in my last five visits,  I was brought a heavily salted steak when I was adamant in ordering no salt on the steak. They offered to replace it and brought me a bloody rare steak when I had ordered medium done. There is a serious communication problem between servers and cooks at this place. Anything slightly unusual about an order baffles them."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 10 on a weeknight after our daughter's graduation from ASU. We are from out of state so we booked this based on yelp reviews and weren't disappointed. Nice looking restaurant, with great food and drinks. Our server was wonderful, too! Everyone in our party seemed to really enjoy it. An excellent choice!!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu selection, they got something for everyone. Salads, seafood, steaks, soups of the day, whatever tickles your fancy. The drink menu was also impressive with a bevy of assorted cocktails to enjoy. We had a perfectly filling lunch, and for the price you get a nicely balanced portion.
Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very solid choice for a decent meal in south charlotte.  Never been disappointed with a variety of selections and service is good. A little pricey for what you get but compared to the local competition, beats them hands down"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Very classy and courteous staff. I ordered the sesame crusted salmon with parmesan mashed potatoes and fried spinach. Hands down the most deliciously cooked fish I've ever eaten! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"very good ahi and amazing brulee cheese cake. our server was very nice and put up with my weird everything on the side changes. when I'm not on a crazy diet I'll def be back"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience whenever I come here. The steak is always cooked perfectly, and the prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of food. Definitely save some room for desert, the Creme brûlée cheesecake is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch at the Firebird today on a recommendation. What a great recommendation. 
1.  The place is something else. Decor is great
2.  Employees are gracious. Saw one young lady not only sweeping under and around table but also dusting entire chairs. 
3.  Employees are dressed most appropriately like they should when serving customers. 
4.  The food is sooooooo good. Veggies are fresh. If you order lemonaid they
donate $1.25 to children's cancer. Husband had the shrimp salad with strawberries enough to feed two.  Said its the best he's ever had. I had their salmon. Ohhhhhh so delicious real fresh veggies. 
5.  Our waiter Daniel P was outstanding and was there to fill our glasses when needed but not overbearing. 

This will now be our to go to place from now on. Thanks Daniel for a first outstanding experience. You were very professional but also friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"In from Atlanta, ratings look good, even though the restaurant is in the mall. The decor was nice, servers friendly and attentive. I had peppercorn steak, wife Salmon. Both outstanding! I can easily recommend the restaurant, although it is a bit pricey. The steak came with only one side item, which could have used another. Bread at the beginning was great too, but the crust was crunchy and made quite the mess!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! The service is great and they prepare your food however you want it (I'm picky). I recommend getting a dish with their baked potato. Their food is fresh and they have healthy options. I always order the salmon without butter or oil."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly welcoming service and most important the food it is delicious!!! I highly recommend it, specially if you are like me, from out of town. Great experience!!!"}
{"text":"My BF and i are from Los Angeles and have been here for 5 days.  We've tried different places here in AZ that aren't in LA during our stay.  Tonight is the last night here, so we decided to try Firebirds, because i love steak and he loves shrimp...and the reviews were good.  So i convinced the BF to give this a try.  He's such a picky eater and during dinner he had a smile i rarely see about a meal.  Half-way thru dinner, he was on his iphone looking to see where the nearest Firebirds to Los Angeles was...too funny!!  

BF = Filet Mignon & Shrimp. Steak is his best ever and he can't stop talking about the very tasty grilled shrimp. 

Me = Filet Mignon and again the best .  The baked potato...YUMMY! 

We look forward to June 2012 for our return, so that we can enjoy Firebirds once again."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday because I heard they were known for good steaks. The ambiance here (Rea Road Location) is real masculine with the dark wood and dim lights. He really enjoyed the decor and felt it was fitting for the occasion. 

We got the Lobster Spinach Queso and OMG it was so freakin good! I pretty much ate the whole thing myself! He got the 14 oz Ribeye and I got the Wood Grilled Salmon. Yum to the salmon. It was cooked to perfection! It came with parmesan mashed potatoes which were creamy and good. Nothing like I have ever had before. My boyfriend enjoyed his Ribeye of course and it was cooked Medium just like he wanted it. He claims it was one of the best steaks he has ever had. 

Overall Firebirds is great and the service was awesome. Fine dining at its best!"}
{"text":"RUDE AND DISCRIMINATORY
  We decided to take my in laws who were visiting from California to Firebirds yesterday evening to enjoy a nice dinner. My husband and I had been here before and we loved our food and service. Tonight was very disappointing and offensive to say the least. Our server Tom greeted our table introducing the specials and asked for our drink order. We all had ordered water since we hadn't had enough time to peek at the drink menu. You could tell it bothered him we ordered \"just\" water. He brought us our waters and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu. He came back with a Hispanic gentleman named Carlos. Confused he asked us in Spanish if we had questions about the menu as Tom was by his side. Puzzled we then realized he had ASSUMED we needed an interpreter!! My husband let Carlos know we were fine and Carlos proceeded to ask us what we were looking for as far as menu selections, again my husband assured him we were fine. As we peered past Carlos's presence we could see the nearby tables staring in our direction in a negative glance as if something was wrong. As the night went on our food was good and Tom was mediocre. He forgot just a few things, but would possibly go unnoticed hadn't the big incident occurred before. We wanted to enjoy our dinner with our family and had to actually process what had happened. We ended the night and didn't seek manager conversation as we didn't want to cause another spotlight at our table which Tom nicely had done for us earlier by recruiting an interpreter. I'm truly insulted not only for myself, but for my family as well. No body deserves that type of treatment and I truly hope that this is the first and last time this happens to any customers who choose to visit this establishment."}
{"text":"The food is good . Customer service however is ??
One of our orders was hot wings ,one of the wings was not cleaned well and has a lot of feathers on it ,we brought it up to the server attention, he went in and came back with a plate with one (1) wing in it ?.
We were just laughing at it since we were not really asking for a replacement or a discount ....
Manager , you need training in customer service sir"}
{"text":"Has been one of my favorite restaurants in the South Park area.  Unfortunately, recently they haven't lived up to expectations. 
Tonight, wanted to take my daughter there for dinner.  Walked in through the rear door at about 6:30 and noticed at least 10 tables open.  When we got to the hostess, she informed us that there would be a wait of at least 10-20 minutes.  After waiting 10, with no one else seated during that time, we left and had a wonderful meal at Yama Asian Fusion next door."}
{"text":"Nosey, crowded but thats due to good food and great location."}
{"text":"First time visiting:  Great food, outstanding service and very professional.  Traveling solo and these guys took really good care of me.  They won my heart this evening."}
{"text":"First time here...I feel as though it was over priced for the quality of the food. The atmosphere was nice, felt like I was in a nice cabin because of all the wood. I had a cheese burger which did not have any sort of spread I had to add some on the side. My boyfriend had a steak..in which had a lot of fat around it..and it tasted like an average steak...certainly not worth $20+. I won't go back because of the price and the quality did not match up to it."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent dinner at this establishment. Recommended by one of the girls at the Cibola Vista Resort. Prompt friendly service, nice ambience. The Kobe beef meatloaf with gravy, Pecan green beans, mashed potatoes were superb. Highly recommended. Oh yes, Ranch onion rings appetizer crispy crunchy; excellent also."}
{"text":"Went for my husbands birthday dinner.  They did not disappoint!  The delmanico ribeye was fabulous!  My husband had the aged ribeye that he loved, and my mom the spicy chicken pasta.  They were so attentative to us, we'd wanted to order dessert, however my son has a nut allergy.  When asked the manager came over promptly and explained what was safe and nut free. Once placing our dessert order, the manager came back to the table, just to ensure that my son enjoyed dessert and that all was ok with him.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Don't know what's happening here, but for second time since it reopened, food delivery has been extremely slow at lunch--like 40+ minutes for 4 salads (one with a thin piece of salmon), so excruciatingly long. Add to that the prices, taking this one off the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Great customer service!   Love thier ribs, creme brulea cheesecake,  and the artichoke lobster dip...sooo good!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Firebirds many times because it's one of the better eateries located around Chandler Mall.  They are very consistent - the food is well prepared, cooked to your specifications, and seasoned properly.  

This weekend, we took a friend out for some Birthday steaks.  The meal started with bread, which was tasty and warm out of the oven.  We didn't get any appetizers this time, but have gotten both the Ranch Rings and the Potato Skins in the past - both are fantastic.  

Three of us ordered the same thing - the sirloin steak, which is a lot of meat for less than $20.  One of us got it well, another medium, and I got it medium rare.  They were all cooked properly and given to the right person - no trading!  The steak was flavorful and tender, and served with an excellent baked potato.  This is a throwaway side at many restaurants, but not here - the outside is salted, it's not microwaved, and it's loaded with quality cheese and bacon.  Delicious!  

The other people in our party ordered the Chicken BLT salad and the Strawberry Goat Cheese salad and enjoyed them.  Firebirds does not skimp with the toppings - they're fresh and plentiful.  The goat cheese is especially good.

We sat outside, because they have a nice patio with misters.  The only complaint about that would be the singer that was performing on the patio - she was pretty bad and too loud, but I can't blame the restaurant for that.

I only have one gripe that kept this from being a 5 star review - they took my favorite burger off the menu!  It had green chile and goat cheese... amazing.  Though the other burgers are good, nothing quite compares."}
{"text":"I have never felt so welcome at a restaurant.  This was our first time at Firebird's.  The staff was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive.  We had the lobster and baby spinach queso, which was fresh and fabulous.  Then filets and lobster tail.  Best part is that the portions you are served are actually one person portions, so there was not a huge plate of wasted food leftover.  Definitely one of my new favorite supper places!"}
{"text":"This place is friggin awesome.  Service was un-paralleled.  
Daniel our bartender was on top of his game.  I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Beef medallions were special tonight. Absolutely awesome! Prime rib was excellent. My husband ordered something he should not have and when he told our waiter this he was concerned. The chef came out and offered to cook a shrimp pasta that my husband says was phenomenal. Extremely pleased with our meal and the 1/2 price wine special let us splurge on a great bottle of Jack London Merlot. (Well, 2 bottles!) service was great and we would definitely recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I made reservations online for party of 6. Received a reminder the day of, which was nice. We were celebrating mom's birthday. The place was very busy for a Thursday.
I ordered Prosecco($12 a glass) and cilantro chicken with a side of mashed potatoes. The food was delicious and the portions were a decent size. Our server was wonderful, and I like the fact that other staff helps pick up dirty dishes off the table and get the refills. I also enjoyed dim lightning. Everybody in my party liked the meal.We ended up staying wayyyyy past the closing time, but no one ever asked us to leave....(we were the only customers in the whole restaurant)!
Will definately come back! Food is medium priced, drinks are a bit on a pricier side but worth it!"}
{"text":"Must say I had such a great lunch there and so did my other 11 family members. We were impressed and we didn't expect such good food. Everything had such great flavor! Even the desserts! For the prices, the food is so tasty and such quality!"}
{"text":"Great food good atmosphere. Went on a thurday evening waited a long time for entrees...like 30mins! Dont come here if your in a hurry. Food was all perfectly done!"}
{"text":"The fish dishes are always great.   You'll get full of the yummy bread too.  One of the things to remeber is that the olace is popular with business types so come etarly for lunch and dinner.  You'll spend around $18 a plate if you like to eat."}
{"text":"Great place. Saturday night date with the wifey. Been a couple of times before and continue to have a great experience. The smoked wings are really good. Gave the lobster queso another try, but not a big fan. 

The coconut shrimp is worth five stars in itself, and the burger is not far behind. 

Each time i've visited, the manager has stopped by to check on us, and service is consistently up there. 

Recommended. Will return again soon."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and wanted to have a steak so we decided to check this place out. Service and the food were excellent. Our waitress was great and the manager came over to greet us and gave us $10 off as a welcome to the area. It was a great experience and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food...very solid menu, something for everyone in your party of picky eaters. Always well prepared, and wait staff is always very sharp. Perfct place for a business dinner, or just a relaxing evening with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent everything! This is our new special occasion dinner spot. We arrived at 6:30 on a Sat night with reservations. By 7, the place was packed. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. There is no dress code, so you had people from very casual to business casual. I noticed a few well-mannered young kids around as well. I liked the medium-lit atmosphere and tables were spread out so as not to feel crowded. Even with all tables full and people waiting, the noise level was great. We did not have appetizers, but several were tempting. The mixed green salad was one of the BEST I've ever had. We both got the 9oz bacon-wrapped filet mignon, medium rare, and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The loaded baked potatoes were just the right size and a side of port mushrooms went well with the meal. I can say that the wait-staff and kitchen are VERY efficient, each course coming out immediately after the other. So, if you want a slow casual dining experience, let your wait-staff know to slow things down. For me, our meal was the perfect speed (a little over 1 hour). It was about $90 for our meal + tip, which I felt was a fair value."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, highly recommend the pecan crusted trout!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times and I'm always struck by how mediocre it is.  The food is just okay and the service is usually weak.  I also find myself distracted by the buns that look like bottoms."}
{"text":"It was a fantastic lunch! Service was great. The BLT salad is almost as good as it gets. I have been to dinner multiple times but first lunch visit. My steak was cooked perfect and great service. What more can you say."}
{"text":"The filet is very good and the meat loaf is awesome with the gravy on it and the mashed potatoes. We have been here a number of times and have always had a great meal with great service."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Firebirds for about  2 years.  I'd say I have enjoyed  20-25 meals there.
I agree with the reviewer who said it's hit and miss, but when you \"hit\"  it's  excellent.  I hit far more often than miss here. Recently I took an out of town guest there.  She said it was the best meal she's had in years.
Another positive thing is if something is wrong they really do try and make it right.
On the not so positive side, the hostesses often seem distracted or engaged with one another. The waiting area is awful but I assume that's to try and make you sit at the bar.
However when your food arrives you'll soon forget your entry!


If you don't want your steak rare,  you need to make that known.  Their idea of medium rare is rare everywhere else in America.  I order medium and say NO RED CENTER. 
Then you truly get pink all the way through... very nice!"}
{"text":"Good limited menu, though we didn't drunk there appeared to be a strong wine list, good volume levels, quiet (but not dead quiet), the service could have been more consistent and faster, but they were very friendly.  

We brought a young child and were impressed with their children's menu; generous, diverse options."}
{"text":"Overall a great food and environment. The bad reviews I read scared me but I am glad we went. Friendly service. A little pricey but worth it. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I had the opp to go back to Firebirds and I must say they have redeemed themselves in my eyes.  I, in fact, took my parents back with me.  We all enjoyed our dinners.  They were not sent back for correction and were able to hold a conversation without interruption from the music.  We even made room for dessert!!  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Solid but not super expensive steak house.  You can certainly get better steaks and decor but you will pay a lot more.  Started with the BLT salad which we split and really enjoyed that.  We both had the Filet, one wrapped in bacon the other with a blue cheese sauce.  Both were excellent with no unwanted fat or tough parts.  Loaded baked potato was good size but maybe a bit dry.  Decent if small wine selection had no trouble finding a reasonable priced wine to go with dinner.  Service was excellent had just a short wait at the bar, long enough to order and start drinking a cocktail."}
{"text":"For attached to a mall it is good food and classy decor.  Reasonable rates."}
{"text":"2nd visit, as amazing as the first!  Hostess, wait staff and Russ, the manager all very attentive.  Food awesome.  Decided I'm not going to any other restaurant in the area unless I know for a fact it is of this caliber.  This is the only restaurant I have been to that never disappoints."}
{"text":"It's a shame what has happened to this restaurant. We have had some good experiences here, but the service has become unbearable. The last four of five times we have dined in at the restaurant we have had huge problems with service and always left really irritated. Ironically this was a restaurant that we used to have really good experiences at when we dined in, but the takeout was nothing but problems. Recently we have done much better with takeout, but now we really don't ever want to dine in at the restaurant anymore. I certainly don't expect any restaurant to be consistently perfect, but after four or five times in a row of being virtually ignored, and other problems, while dining at the restaurant, I think it's safe to say it's more than just an occasional problem, or just bad luck.

On this visit we went to the restaurant early on a Saturday, hoping to avoid a crowd, and hopefully get better service. Clearly crowds are not the problem. There must have been more employees milling about than there were customers. It started just like other visits, where it seemed like we were invisible. Adding insult to injury, we were seated on the left side of the restaurant where there were only a total of three tables occupied, and two waitresses waiting on them. Yet, still no one would come to our table and wait on us. Just as I was about to get up and ask someone why we were not being waited on, a waitress finally showed up. However, it was not one of the two waitresses working the tables around us. It turned out it was a waitress who was working tables all of the way on the other side of the restaurant, and working more tables than the two waitresses combined on our side. We were the only table she was waiting on that wasn't all the way on the other side of the restaurant. Why would they do this? The restaurant was less than a quarter full, if that.

Sure enough, she took our order, and we began a long wait before getting our food. When we finally got our food, my son's salad was covered in Caesar dressing instead of the ranch he requested. He does not like Caesar dressing. This wouldn't be so bad, but once again we could not get someone to come to the table so that he could get it fixed. We waited what seemed like forever. My son staring at his food, me eating mine, and both of us with nothing to drink.

Eventually I lost patience and asked one of the many employees just milling about the restaurant if I could see the manager. The woman that I asked was walking up and down the aisle the whole time we were in the restaurant doing nothing but entering information in a tablet. Other employees milling about occasionally stopped and chatted in groups, but no waitress for us. Eventually my son got his new salad and we got our drinks, but we were there a LONG time. I was long done eating but had to watch as my son eat as he was just getting his food.

This restaurant is managed very poorly. I think most of the patrons could step in and do a better job without any experience. At the very least they could figure out that it's a bad idea to have a waitress come from the other side of the restaurant to help two waitresses who have less tables combined than the one who served us from afar."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town. Stayed at hotel just across the way.  Seemed like nice place, even though I was by myself, the staff was attentive, the food was delicious.  I had a vegetarian option, I think it was called a portobello burger.  Just the right amount of spiciness.  The hotel staff dropped me off and picked me up, which was nice because I did not rent a car as I was travelling with a co-worker.  A little bit on the pricy side compared to my usual haunts, but probably right in line with Chandler-area eateries."}
{"text":"We had not been to a Firebirds since forever and decided to stop by for lunch after watching Coco at the AMC.  
I ordered the pecan crusted trout, my dining companion the smokehouse chicken sandwich with fries and we were both quite disappointed by our choices. The pecan crust was dry, fish past its prime, and the texture of tortilla strips mixed in the slaw just didn't work for me. His chicken was over cooked and the fries were so-so. 
The only bright spot was our server/bartender who was attentive, and she brought me a cup of mango habanero salsa after I complained about the fish being dry."}
{"text":"Wow! Sesame encrusted salmon and their trout dish was amazing. Their homemade bread is yummy and hot. Service was great and ambiance was nice for a nice quiet meal with a friend.
I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service.  Good specials.  Good food.  Competitive prices.  Lively atmosphere.  Best kids menu / coloring page ever.  If it were closer we'd be there once a month."}
{"text":"Had the turkey burger and waffle sweet tater fries.  Yummy!  The ground turkey had a wonderful charcoal flavor, served on soft bun with fresh lettuce and tomato.  The sweet tater fries were crisp and hot. Service was good. Food was great!
One negative to note,  it is very loud in this restaurant, no soft surfaces to absorb noise."}
{"text":"Lunch today with a friend. Awesome, tortilla soup and salad so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The wait was extremely long, however it makes sense since we did go on a saturday night! We went for our anniversary and our server was so sweet to us & made us a special dessert! Food was great! :)"}
{"text":"First time there and probably last time, my husband made reservations for mother's day and I was really excited since I had never been there, as soon as the waiter came around I knew it would not be good, he acted very annoyed for probably having to work on Sunday, we asked for a bottle of wine that took forever to get, came around to take care of other tables around us but took forever to finally get to ours. While ordering he replied\"what? I can't hear you\" , our food arrived after a long wait, had to ask for silverware, still had the tab book from the previous customer, terrible first impression,not even a \"happy mother's day\" but more of \"what do you want\" ."}
{"text":"The service was alright but they were friendly. We kinda felt like we were rushed. Different servers were constantly asking to take our plates.Our server didn't know much about the drink menu. Beer selection was poor if you are looking for microbrews. Our appetizer arrived before our drinks. We had the crabcakes and they were good. My filet was fabulous, my husband's ribeye was a little overdone but tasty, ceasar salad was decent. We tried their brownie desert and it was good but not my favorite."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place since we were in Chandler for other business.  Nice, relaxing atmosphere, wonderful decor.  Our server was Naomi and she provided great personable/fun service.  One thing I always watch is how the crew works.  The entire crew worked as team, including the management.  Very customer friendly restaurant.  I also really like, and prefer, going to restaurants with the open kitchens out in front of the customers.

I do not eat red meat, but there are menu items that I could chose from.  Since I am a big salad eater, there were some nice ones to chose from.  The menu did seem a little limited overall though.  This place is a definite must for the meat and potatoes eaters.

My son had the wood fired salmon special ($14), which was probably the best he has had here in the valley (I took a small taste and found it mouth watering good).  The mixed vegetable medley that came with the dinner, was cooked to the point of  just being soggy veggies.  Absolutely no nutritional value in them and not very good.  We left them on the plate.  Still enough food with the salmon piece and the mashed potatoes, that he was full, which is rare for him.

I had the spinach/mushroom salad ($11).  Interesting that the spinach was sliced up rather than served in it's leaflets.  Nice simple salad and very good delicious vinaigrette dressing.  Quite a bit, so I had lunch for the next day.

We will definitely be returning next time we have the opportunity to be in the southeast valley.  I look forward to trying something different on the menu.  When they get one up here in the North Scottsdale area, we will be regulars."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there today for lunch.  We both had the pepper steak sliced top sirloin.  The bread was good.  The steak was delicious, cooked perfectly medium rare.  I had the stuffed baker and my wife had the au gratin potatoes.  They were delicious.  Extra cheesy.  Service was good.  Two different managers came around to check on us.  Over all it was a great lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places close to home.  Their prime rib may consistently b e the best I've ever had.  Great food all around, great open decor, great service.  What else can I say.  I love it!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation here for my 4 year old daughters birthday in August, and the service was great from start to finish.  At the end of the meal, our waitress brought her an icecream dish that was decorated with chocolate syrup on the plate that read \"happy birthday, princess\". The waitress, Taylor, even made her a sweet card.  The service was very impressive and made her day special.  The kids meals here are HUGE and come with two sides so there were no complaints there.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and I really enjoyed them.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Our family went here for a celebration last Friday night.  It was bumping and the atmosphere was cozy/crowded.

Things I liked:  Free valet service, call-ahead seating, crayons and a colorful kids menu that had non-fried options, and a unique high-chair that looked less uncomfortable than most.  Also, the Cucumber Gimlet Martini was refreshing (if you are a gin drinker) and the soups (tomato and chicken tortilla) were both yummy.  Our server, Kendra, was nice and did her job well.

Things of which I was not a fan:  My chief complaint was the SALT!  This was the saltiest food I have had in a while.  It was so salty that my dad cancelled a side order of spinach after tasting someone else's.  Every leaf was covered in salt.  My son's chicken and my husband's sandwich were both very salty and my mom said that she thought the kitchen staff may have accidentally double-salted her burger.  I tasted it and it was . . . salty!  I asked for double rub on my \"Delmonico\" so I was not as disappointed by its saltiness - though what I was looking for was more spice, which cannot be added separately from the other ingredients in the rub.  Also the wines by the glass are pricey. 

A friend who joined us ordered the sesame-coated salmon and it was NOT too salty.  I had a taste and it was yummy."}
{"text":"First time visit for a veterans meal on memorial day.  Food was great, service was excellent!  I was also surprised by the fact that there was no veteran only menu to order off of.  Our selections were from the regular menu.  The discounted item was the most inexpensive item we ordered.   Definitely plan to visit again."}
{"text":"Good food and vibe, not my favorite spot and probably better options nearby. Nothing unique or special in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends went to the bar to get a drink from the bartender and he would not serve us . So the other bartender got our drinks and it was just 2 beer . How hard is 2 beers. We didn't feel welcome what so ever. We waited 15 minutes to get a table. The dinner was good. Spinach & Queso was delicious but it did take a while( 45 minutes) to get our meal."}
{"text":"Two words:  Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib.  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Firebirds has 3 dozen locations and I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants but wow... the Smokehouse Burger is one of my favorite burgers of all time. With Java bbq sauce, applewood-smoked bacon, cheddar, and red onion on a fresh baked bun this burger is probably the freshest burger on the planet and makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The bbq sauce is divine, the cheddar is freshly crumbled, the bun is so fresh it comes out with flour still on it. Take one bite and any burger aficionado will see the simple ingredients and attention to execution make this one of the Best Burgers in Charlotte."}
{"text":"REALLY liked this place, the food was great, their coconut shrimp was amazing! Oh my goodness they have a phenomenal pineapple martini, this thing is not artificially flavored like all the other martinis, the alcohol sits in actual pineapple slices for 21 days! It's a must try to anyone dining here! I tried my husbands steak, that too was very flavorful! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent,  wood fired salmon, even better prime rib, it's nice to have steamed veggies that are freshly steamed and still very crispy. I  suggest calling ahead on weekends,  it waa 40 minute wait so we ate at the bar, great service.  It was an hour wait when we left, we arrived at 615 on  Saturday night. My wife likes marguiritas , said it was the best she ever had, i don't like margaritas,  I  did like their house margarita, I may have 1 next time."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I had the peppercorn steak and it was melt in your mouth, delicious, still tender and flavorful even at well done.

However, we gave them our email address for a 10% discount and signing up for their email list and we were immediately flooded with spam mail, which I did not appreciate. On top of that we've never even gotten any mail that's actually from Firebird's."}
{"text":"Firebirds was a great selection for lunch today with Hubbie, bro-in Law & Shirley, their mom.
We had burgers, I had fish Tacos. Food was good, we all liked the tater-tots. I recommend hthe fish tacos. Nice wine selection by the glass."}
{"text":"Loved (as in past tense) the french dip sandwich. Somewhere over the years they switched out the soft edible bun for a hard, doughy baguette which makes the sandwich so much harder to eat and enjoy.  Twice burned, I'll have to find something else on the menu since my wife loves (as in present tense) the soup and salad.  The french dip is definitely NOT worth anything close to $16.99, so I would not recommend it on that basis either."}
{"text":"Normally I do not think of chain restaurants as a go to for dinner. However, Firebirds has it going on!

My husband and I had the pleasure of attending a fantastic tasting event here. Since then, we have been back twice. Both times we have sat at the bar, by choice. Mainly cause I like staring at the wall of liquor bottles and imagining this place as a must hit in the case of a zombie apocalypse. 

Recently, my husband and I came Friday night for a drink and appetizer. My husband got the Bourbon and Ginger Smash and I got the Glenmo Sour. Both drinks were fantastic. For an appetizer, we got the crap cakes. The slaw with the crab cakes completed the dish. Super tasty.

Service was excellent. Overall, great dining experience!"}
{"text":"First time attending this restaurant and sure won't be my last. Food arrived in a timely matter. The server customer server was wonderful and knowledge of the menu was a absloute. The cocktails were made just right and the food was very tasty. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The drinks are decent. The food is really good. The hosting staff is very professional. However, when I came in for a drink Saturday night, the male bartender really acted like an ass. Some of his comments made me feel extremely awkward. What was really embarrassing was that I was there on a first date with a guy I really liked. I am definitely hesitant to return to Firebirds because of this one employee."}
{"text":"Service was excellent & food was delicious! The BLT Salad is my favorite....always cold & always tasty! Sat on the patio to enjoy the summer evening but was afraid service would not be as good. What a pleasant surprise to have some of the best service I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner and a first time visit.  Great food and great service! Our server, Theresa was awesome and very knowledgeable about the menu, gave suggestions and was extremely friendly. The queso dip was phenomenal as was the salad and the filet! The augratin potatoes were a little spicy but delicious non the less...and for dessert...the best warm brow or I have literally EVER tasted! Great atmosphere (besides the grumpy angry and mean old people at the table next to us), great food and great service. We will absolutely go back! Oh! And the Firebird signature martini, the double black diamond, was amazing! 2 thumbs up gang!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but I wasn't impressed with the food.  My husband and I went to Firebirds for a date night.  We both ordered prime rib, which was super tough.  It wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed the food immensely at Firebirds we still will continue to eat in the restaurant but in the future we will no longer be doing happy hour because, overtime everything that we enjoyed on the menu has been removed, it has just gone down hill, so happy hours no more for us!"}
{"text":"I got into Charlotte after a long day of work, then flying.  So, I was ready for a drink and something yummy.  My girlfriend brought me here, my first visit, her second.  It was definitely hopping on a Thursday night.  It was full except for 2-3 tables in the restaurant, 2 cocktail tables in the bar area, and one bar stool. We jumped on an open cocktail table gladly not having to wait.  They had quite a nice drink menu, several different cocktail, martini choices.  I just went with something simple, and friend with a draft beer. Our cocktail waitress wasnt exactly cheery, friendly, or attentive.  After sitting several minutes with an empty drink, she came around, not to ask us if we'd like another drink, etc, but to let us know that she was leaving and we needed to pay.  I can't remember exactly how she worded it, but both myself and friend are/have been in the industry for years, and we were both shocked at the way she'd said this to us.  While of course we said we'd pay her out if she was cut, I just wish, after her already not-so-great attitude, that she would have worded it differently/approached it differently.  On top of that, lol and I know this might make me sound bad, but it had been a LONG day, and it was chill time, we ended up waiting almost another 5-7 minutes before we even saw our next server to get another round of drinks.  This is something that I feel strongly about, especially during these transer/server-takeover situation, that the customer not be able to tell because the transition is so smooth.  Either way, our next server, Debbie, was great!  She quickly picked up and made the rest of our evening Great!!
After my friend telling me several great choices, I decided on the Wood Grilled Salmon with a baked potato, and steamed veggies.  Even though I had several changes to make to the dish bc of dietary restrictions, the waitress said several times,  \"We will make it however you want us to.\"  I really dont go out to eat all that much, because it can be such a hard time trying to get something I can eat, but not make the kitchen have to do too much.  She was definitely the most accomodating I've dealt with, concerning ordering.  My friend decided on the Fried Chicken Salad, no honey mustard, sub Balsamic.
When our food came, it looked so appetizing.  My salmon, though completely plain was absolutely the tastiest salmon I've ever had, and cooked to a perfect medium, per my request.  Friend said the salad was great, the balsamic was a great choice.  Oh, and they had brought us a nice round of bread to start with.As we finished up, Debbie boxed my food for me.  We finished up with getting a dessert to go, and another round of drinks.
Overall, the whole meal was super.  The building itself has such a warm feeling; the colors and smell from open cook line and the fireplace in the bar definitely added to that glowing ambiance.  I will be back here the next time I'm in town for sure.  It was swanky, yet not expensive for what we got. And of course, I recommend our waitress Debbie, who totally rocked it."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened.   We used to come here when it first opened. Food was good.   We went here for our 5 year anniversary.   My husband made surprise reservations for us.  They said they would \"take care of us\".  We got there and we had to wait a couple of minutes for our table.  Then they sat us right by the serving line/kitchen area - sooooo very romantic.  Server Didn't offer complimentary anniversary dessert like most places would.   Food wise - The steak was tough.   Shrimp didn't have much flavor.  Wasn't worth our $100 bill.   We won't go there agOverall We decided to continue our patronage at Texas Roadhouse.  They haven't disappointed ever in all the years."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was good as usual. Love the coconut shrimp,good mango chutney with it.  My steak salad was cooked to perfection (ordered without blue cheeseand)  the quesadilla app that my friend ordered as a meal was good size and tasty."}
{"text":"One word: Wings. Get them. Now. 

Now i've been to numerous wing joints but this for sure is the best chicken wings you will ever have. Every single bite is dynamic in flavor, taste and texture. I have never had smoked wings until now and I have to say, no competition. Hands down the best.

I also ordered a burger (forget the name) but the meat also had a great smoked taste to it. 

The service was fast and the waiter was always on the ball. It's probably a good idea to call ahead of time and put your name down as it may get crowded at times. 

The price is a little on the expensive side but you get what you pay for. You can taste the quality. 

Overall Firebirds is worth it."}
{"text":"If this place is a chain, it certainly doesn't feel like it... which I count as a good thing.

The atmosphere here was pleasant and had a log cabin feel to it without feeling corny. The service was fast and friendly. The manager even came by to see if everything was alright.

I had a grilled shrimp & strawberry salad, which was excellent. The bread they serve before you receive your food was very tasty. The food was modestly priced, most items being between $10 to $15, but the alcohol seemed pretty expensive (which doesn't surprise me). Overall this place didn't blow me away, but it was very good and I would consider going back here."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at Firebirds.  There service was fantastic and the servers were great.  The atmosphere was very warm and cozy.   I had the filet and shrimp.   The filet was very flavorful and had the nice wood fire taste to it.   The shrimp were just standard shrimp skewers, nothing special at all.  I also had the au gratin potatoes which were super good.  I will likely be going back."}
{"text":"I should have learned my lesson the last time I ate here.   If you really want good food and service you know which steakhouses to go to.  Charlotte has several.   You'll pay 25% more but the food is far better, the atmosphere is better, you can actually have/hear dinner party conversation, and the service is impeccable.  Also, the quality steakhouses honor their reservations rather than luring diners to come and wait for 30-60 minutes by assuring them they are reserved."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Love the ambiance, big interior.  Service is good, we showed up late so not their fault.  The food was perfect! I got the steak, juicy.  It was cooked perfect, medium.  I was hooked by the moment our food arrived.  You can tell the cooks really have made it a goal to make sure every plate is cooked properly, a  lot of attention to detail.  I will be back, and suggest you go."}
{"text":"Laying in bed awake tonight, I had to write about an unpleasant experience today.

 

My wife and I were experiencing an exciting moment today that had been a long time coming. As such we wanted to celebrate with a night out on the town.

 

We were to be in the Arrowhead area late this afternoon, and wanted to start our evening early with a celebratory meal. After some research, she chose a highly rated restaurant called Firebirds.

We originally set a reservation for 4:00 dinner that we later moved back to 4:15 due to a delay that we encountered. We arrived at the restaurant at 4:08 and announced ourselves to the hostess. Despite a plethora of open tables at that hour, she thought it best to seat us closer to our reservation time, and suggested that we check out the bar since it was happy hour. Confused, we went to the bar, looked at the menu, and nothing particularly interested us enough to order, so we began walking back to the lobby. Less than 90 seconds after the hostess had directed us there, she called us to be seated.

She escorted us to a table, and along the way there was the strong odor of sulphur in the air. This was later attributed to a happy hour offering called Jalapeno Deviled Eggs - which might normally sound appealing but seemed to be the source of the pungent aroma at our table.

Our waiter came shortly there after and we ordered a bottle of champagne. This was a $50 bottle that we had experienced before at the winery itself, and was among three such wines offered on the menu. He did not speak very clearly, particularly since the restaurant was not too loud; we had difficulty understanding his mumbling.

We positioned ourselves on the same side of the table in hopes of the server taking a photo of us toasting our success. He came back with a chilling bucket about five minutes later, then left. After seeing him walking around over the next five minutes, he arrived at our table with two bottles - one a $35 bottle and the other an $80 bottle, both from the wine list, apologizing that the one that we had requested was not available. He offered no compromise, other than a \"half and half\" which I did not understand from his unintelligible description. At that point, I suggested that we leave and go elsewhere.

We had been seated for nearly 15 minutes at that point, and had not even been offered water! In all of my 63 years, I can't ever recall being seated at a restaurant and leaving before getting served a glass of water. For the anticipated celebration that we both wanted, this restaurant was a total wet blanket on the fire of our excitement.

We ultimately went a block down the road to another restaurant, and despite not having a reservation were seated immediately and had an outstanding experience.

If you've never been to Firebirds and are looking for a good dining experience, I urge you to try someplace - any place else. There are a LOT of places to choose from in the P83 district. We need not give this one a second chance."}
{"text":"I've been here for a couple of work lunches.  The food is pretty good.  I always get the salads--the BLT salad is by far my favorite.  It's always really crowded during the week at lunch, but we always manage to get a table and quick service."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times with friends and family and always enjoy our food, no matter what we get. Unfortunately we learned that their takeout service is simply not up to par with their sit down service. 

Every single time we've ordered take out, there has been a issue with our food that we don't discover until we are home and hungry. Overcooked steaks, wrong substitutions, the attention to detail is simply overlooked. We have not been back after three underwhelming takeout orders in a row."}
{"text":"Poor time and reservation management. 

We recently had a reservation for dinner at The Firebird Grilat 6:45 pm. Our party of four, my wife and I together with friends visiting from Texas, arrived 10 minutes early. Sadly, after being told we would be seated shortly, we stood in a very crowded and hot bar and waiting area until about 7:22 pm. No excuses - this was not acceptable. 

The reservation was made on-line. The indication was there was a good deal of availability - not even close. No apologies, no free drink, nothing. Just standing and waiting dodging the wait staff in the bar as they tried to serve the customers in the area. We checked on our reservation several times, no apology for the delay, just we will seat you shortly. Shortly was 42 minutes after our reservation time!

Poor restaurant management skills everywhere. Not customer friendly at all, just a production line of late seatings. 

Then there was our server. She was wonderful. Very cheerful and polite. She assisted with menu selections and was very attentive. She had the attitude that the girls at the reservation desk could learn from. 

The food was ok ( a 6.5/10). I doubt we will return. As a business that is customer centric in nature, they failed miserably. The server was in a bad position from the starting line. She saved the evening from total disaster. Our friends from Austin, TX were not impressed. 

February 3

As an update to my less than favorable review in January, I did have communication from Firebirds. I then received a call from their Regional Manager. She was sincere in her response and made things right. Although the night with friends was not 100%, the management team was responsive to my feelings and experience. As a consumer, that is all that I can ask. 

We went back for lunch this past week and the food and service was good. 

Worth another shot for dinner in the future. They may have had a bad night."}
{"text":"Best FireBirds I have ever ate at!! Their bread is delicious and their chips are great. TRY IT!!!!! Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"this firebirds is ok. nothing very special. you cant really talk because of all the noise!! the food is ok. try the firebirds on sharon road in southpark. its a lot better."}
{"text":"Amazing little gem in Ballantyne that's tucked off the main road. Food is fresh and well prepared. This place is a little pricy but the food is well worth the price. The patio area where the fireplace is provides nice ambience and a laid back atmosphere.  Wood planked salmon was beautifully prepared and a joy to eat."}
{"text":"As always the food looks and tastes great! The staff greeted us by opening the door when we arrived and the attentive service continued from there. A visit by the GM again this visit just added that extra touch. Next time we save room and get the pumpkin cheesecake!"}
{"text":"We come here for dinner often for two main reasons; the consistent quality of the food and great staff. Tonight is no exception! While crowded because of Queen's Feast, two managers stopped by to see how we were doing and engage in casual conversation. 

Tonight I thought I would take advantage of the special menu, of which some will also become part if their new summer feature items. The pork porterhouse with the peach jalapeño glaze is fantastic and well worth a try. Good thick cut cooked just right!"}
{"text":"My husband I second time going as of Dec 19, 2015. I doubt that I will be returning in the near future.  My husband had the ribeye that was overpriced for the size, it's was so below it's potential,  he had a spoonful of veggies on the side. I had the salmon it was OK,  wasn't a exciting dish and kind of bland. I did have some onion rings for a app it's was good. Overall just a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"3 stars for the service, 2 stars for the food. 

Seems there's a quality control problem in the kitchen. 
1. Pretzels with beer cheese: took over 25 minutes to come out and the cheese was so watered down you couldn't dip without it dripping all over. 
2. Ribeye: ordered Med-rare. Server confirmed warm, red center and husband said yes, almost bleeding. Came out Med-well and tough as nails. Tough Ribeye? Hmmm
3. Caesar salad: drowning in very garlicky dressing. Shaved parm on top was great, as were the croutons. Could have used less than half the dressing. 
4. Parmesan mashed potatoes: Bland. Like so bland. Had to use salt. ??
5: side veggies: well seasoned and still a little crunchy. Very good
6. Baked potato: asked for everything on the side but it came on top - luckily bacon on side as it has clearly been sitting around for some time. Cheese tasted fake- like shredded velveeta, no butter as promised- only sour cream. And chives. 

Will give it one more shot since everyone from the bartender to server to two managers we had contact with were very nice. One nasty hostess, but hey, it's cool. Everyone has an off day."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for the strawberry shrimp salad! Would be 5 stars if they added maybe another 1/2 TB of candied pecans :)"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Waitress had an attitude. Ordered my steak medium well. I got it and it was rare. Just wasn't a good experience."}
{"text":"Firebirds in Gilbert is a perfectly fine restaurant, but if you're looking for something \"high end\" you might be better served to look elsewhere.

First, I had some problems with my dinner reservation made via Open Table. We had a party of eight, yet it seems that Open Table will not make a reservation for eight at this restaurant between the hours of 4:45pm and 8:30pm. I contacted the manager at Firebirds about this and he advised me that he'd make a note on our reservation that we were a party of eight and everything would be taken care of. When I called the day before our dinner to confirm, nobody knew anything about this spoken arrangement. In the end, we were seated when we arrived and without issue, yet there were a few moments of doubt. 

Upon arrival, the first thing that we noticed was that the restaurant and bar are both very noisy. In fact, after we were seated for dinner, I could not converse with one of my guests just two chairs away. This was not conducive to catching up with old friends or meeting new ones.

Firebirds is a steakhouse, and they charge steakhouse prices. That's fine with me, but I also expect steakhouse decorum. For example, there was no table cloth on our table, just exposed vinyl tabletops. Like Denny's.

The meal itself was tasty, however it took a long time after we ordered to have food delivered to the table. While waiting for our food, our waiter kept our drinks coming. One of those drinks, in fact, was spilled by our server across our table resulting in a flurry of waitstaff to clean up the mess. It was promptly cleaned up, apologies issued, and the glass refilled, but there was no compensation of any kind for the disruption.

When the steaks arrived at last, the medium-rare steak I ordered was very much rare. Tasty, but a bit too red for me. The mashed potatoes were excellent. We were celebrating a birthday that evening and our dessert arrived on a plate beautifully decorated with a \"Happy Birthday\" greeting skillfully written in chocolate across the plate. Very pretty.

Then, it was time to pay the bill. The first thing I did when we sat down was to share with our server a $10 discount code that had been emailed to me by Firebirds. He recorded the code and told me it would be reflected on the bill. It was not. Finally, after providing my credit card to pay the bill, the portfolio was returned to me to add a tip and to sign. Unfortunately, it was brought back to me without my credit card. After searching around my table and seat to be sure I had not dropped it myself, I found our server and explained the problem. He promptly went looking for my credit card, and returned with a card he said he found on the floor. It was not mine. Ultimately, my card was found (somehow in the manager's office) and safely returned to me. 

I like this place and I will likely return for one of their delicious double diamond martinis, but I doubt that I will return for any special occasion."}
{"text":"We had a decent meal and delicious cocktails during our recent visit to Firebirds.  To me it was a fairly typical upscale restaurant mall experience - similar to a Cheesecake Factory.  Our server was very friendly and the service was prompt.  I had a grilled tenderloin salad - ordered my steak medium rare and it came pretty rare but was still edible.  The dressing and other ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The drink menu was creative and the one I ordered was a nice combination of flavors but had just a trace of alcohol.  Overall a decent experience if you're in the area but nothing I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Usually I go to the Firebirds in Chandler but was on the west side.  I have to say the service was as wonderful as it is in Chandler and the food was equally as good.  I had the strawberry and shrimp salad.  The cook was a little to heavy on the pepper on the shrimp for me but everything was fresh, abundant and good.  Service was exceptional.  The other meals were the ribs and filet.  Everyone's meal was great...only wish the fireplace was positioned in the eating area and not the bar!"}
{"text":"Reservations were made. We arrived to the restaurant about 10mins early. She gave us a pager and told us the table would be ready shortly. After about 20mins I went to check on the table and the hostess told me they hadn't buzzed us yet. So we went back to the bar (cater-cornered from the hostess stand) and waited. After seeing repeatedly seeing ppl that arrived after us be seated, I went back to the hostess stand. She said the pager must not be working, because the paged & we didn't respond. They seated us about 10mins later. The waitress was great! The food was ok. It was restaurant week, so I'm guessing the chefs were rushing, because the food is normally good."}
{"text":"I am an employee of Belk here at Northlake mall and on my lunch break some coworkers and I decided to eat Firebirds. I heard that the service and food were great so I wanted to check it out for myself. Well I can say that I will be coming back because of my experience and my charming server as well Shannon. He was very kind and gentleman like, the manager Brett stopped by our table as well. I will be coming back again very soon and requesting Shannon specifically to be my waiter."}
{"text":"The steaks are terrific and the atmosphere is great! We have been going there for years and we are always pleased with our experience!"}
{"text":"We really like Firebirds. However, parking has changed, and there is little or no parking available for lunch. I spent a good 10 minutes searching today, finally finding a space several blocks away, but Deb never did get a space. So, off to Roosters. I realize that the owners of the complex probably changed the parking and that Firebirds is suffering the consequences, but it is no longer a lunch option for us. Too bad."}
{"text":"Pretty great, the food is good and so are the drinks (can you tell I'm trying to meet word count?) well I hope you guys have found this useful (what am I doing?) if you want to eats some food I r drink a drink, go to firebirds because they are good!"}
{"text":"the best meal we've had in years. Absolutely incredible food, great staff and management and fantastic atmosphere. We would've added a few photos but the food didn't last a minute on the table! Highly recommend Firehouse!!"}
{"text":"Waiting far too long with open table reservation when there were many tables available to sit dow"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 6:30 tonight.  We got to the restaurant at 6:25 and were told it was going to be a small wait. We were sat and didn't have any wait staff come over for 10 minutes.  We ended up leaving and going to the Keg because I know I will get quality service at the Keg.  This is something I have experienced before with firebirds. At least they are consistent ..."}
{"text":"Loves this place. Great food great environment. My wife and I love to sit at the bar and drink. They have a great happy hour with a great menu as well. Everything I've eaten here has been awesome. The coconut shrimp is amazing. There is a pasta on the menu that is one of the best pastas I've ever eaten. It's the firebirds chicken pasta. Please order it so I can know other people are experiencing deliciousness."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food took way too long and it was a Wednesday! When I finally got my steak it was overcooked and there was so much peppercorn that I couldn't eat it. So so bad!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses in Charlotte, good food, above average service, menu has a few more choices than the higher end steakhouses, prices are a bit high, but not as high as the better steakhouses. Overall the food is good. I like the steak, sides, meatloaf. The bread you get to start your meal is good. lemonade is amazingly sweet and sour at same time, good lemonade."}
{"text":"I walked into Firebirds and realized that I had been to a Firebirds before at Arrowhead a few years ago. I immediately began to be nervous because I couldn't remember my last visit, which probably meant that I stuffed it down deep into my subconscious never to be discussed again. Possibly.

Our reservation was for 5:45pm, but I arrived early to have some drinks with friends. I was greeted by the hostess who was friendly enough. I informed her that I had arrived early to have some drinks at the bar before being seated for dinner. She found my reservation, noted that I was here and welcomed us. 

We sat down at the bar and were immediately offered a drink. My friend and I were struck by the beautiful display of pineapple slices sitting in vodka. Very pretty and inspiring. We ordered their pineapple martinis. YUM! A little on the sweet side, but still very delicious and intoxicating. We sat and chatted for a while at the pretty bar. Our bartender was very friendly and unobtrusive. One thing that I did notice is that the hostesses were a little unprofessional. They were horsing around, giggling, and chatting loudly. A bit annoying, but they were young girls. After two of those yummy martinis, it was time for dinner.

Our party of 5 was seated at a round table in the center of the dining room. We were greeted by our server Brittany who took our drink orders and delivered water and lemons with speed. We informed her that we were there for the Phoenix Restaurant Week menu. She took the time to make recommendations off of the Restaurant Week menu and suggested wines to go with each of them.  Ahh my dinner...

I ordered the Espresso Rubbed Sirloin rare. The steak came with Potatoes Au Gratin. I was a little nervous ordering a sirloin steak because they tend to be a little tough due to the \"cheapness\" of the meat. I figured I was in a place that prides themselves on steaks and decided to give their \"cheap\" steak a shot. It's a good way to test a steakhouse. They should be able to make a shoe taste delicious.

When the meal was served, my rare (still moo'in) steak got served to someone else. So I sent my steak back for a rare one. I am SO glad that I sent it back for the steak I wanted. The steak was absolutely gorgeous and delicious. It was not tough at all! The rub that was on it was a little peppery for my taste but it's a personal preference for me. The Potatoes Au Gratin weren't good. They were a little too Velveeta for my taste. It would have been nice if they used some sharp cheddar or something like that instead. I ended up eating my friend's poblano mashed potatoes with my steak. Fantastic! The mashed potatoes were very spicy and went great with my savory steak! I hope they are a regular side. They're phenomenal! The dessert I chose was the Peaches and Cream Bread Pudding Cupcake with Bourbon White Chocolate Sauce. It seemed I chose the right dessert for the night because my other friends did not like the other choices for dessert at all. By the time I got my dessert, I was full, but the bites that I did take were delicious! It was a subtle peach flavor with a great sauce I wanted to eat the whole thing but my stomach just wouldn't do it. Brittany gladly wrapped everyones leftovers and put them in a to go bag. She was so quick and effiecient. Very impressive!

I am so glad I didn't dredge up any repressed memories of a horrible dining experience at Firebirds. In fact, the \"mmm's and oooh's\" that were being uttered were very familiar. It was nice getting reacquainted with such a great restaurant! I don't know why I didn't keep in touch, but I plan on going for regular visits from now on!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and ate both times at the bar.  The bartenders were nice and made sure that my beer was poured quickly.  I can't say that they have a great selection of beers on draft - a Sam's seasonal, a local micro-brew and then a couple of the big boy breweries.  

Most recently, I tried the shrimp and filet.  The shrimp are skewered and covered in butter and garlic.  A little too much for me. Also, they were slightly over cooked but not rubbery. I was more disappointed in the filet.  The filet was oddly shaped so it didn't cook evenly.  Medium on some of the edges, mostly medium rare and then some rare parts too.  It was kinda odd.  If it was cut right, I think it would probably have come out better.  Finally, please do not wrap bacon around the filet.  I don't get this. Yes, I love bacon like many people, but let's keep the steak alone.  Seriously, the steak looked like it was wearing a jiggly bacon belt. Not pretty."}
{"text":"Delicious! Their chicken quesadilla is a MUST. I would never order a quesadilla anywhere, since I feel like I can make so easily at home with the same taste. However, not with this place. It is fantastic and very flavorful and unique. My bf and I come here all the time and share a chicken quesadilla as well as something else. We tried their parmesan chicken last time and that too was delicious. The sauce was amazing, as well as the mashed potatoes! Highly recommend this place. (Pictures of our meals posted)"}
{"text":"HIGHLIGHT OF OUR EVENING! We totally lucked out and were waited on by Bree! WOW is all I can say. Did she know the menu (front to back), Was she professional (More than any server I have had in a while), Did she take care of your dining needs (Above and Beyond), one of the best service experiences I have had!

Happy Hour Daily - The Cheeseburger with Bacon and Tater Tots was a hit! The Tater Tots kinda stole the show here!

Now who can say NO to Seared Tuna...Ok some, but NOT me. Seared perfectly and the spicy mustard sauce is outstanding! Great start.

Now the Star of the night, Drum roll please.........Steak Delmonico with Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes! Bree you had me at Au Gratin. Absolutely the best Au Gratin I have had anywhere in Arizona! I know the Delmonico was great, but the Au Gratin, it was almost addicting.

(Not good was the Pasta, order anything else but)

Great place a must stop for sure! Chef Approved On The Road Eats"}
{"text":"Without fail - every. single. time. when I order take out or use a delivery service, my meal is wrong. Even a salad is wrong. I'm not sure if it's sloppiness or carelessness but it's getting worse and is increasingly becoming more frustrating.  Wait times times for take out are also increasing - even at off peak times. I'd be ok with the additional wait if orders were actually correct."}
{"text":"Grilled salmon with cilantro lime butter was very fresh. Typically the salmon is pretty good here along with the crab cakes or the ribs. And on a Tuesday no less."}
{"text":"Firebird's is pretty good. The Creme Brulee cheesecake is really good! It's a typical grill restaurant with a beautiful bar area. I wouldn't say there's anything special about the place but I've never been disappointed. I usually get the smokehouse chicken sandwich with fries. The sandwich comes with BBQ sauce, Cheddar, Bacon and Red Onion. It's a winner everytime. For those of you looking for a good salad, folks swear by the Strawberry salad. If anyone is doing Weight Watchers, I don't recommend it...it's 28 points. Yikes! Do some shopping and stop by Firebirds...they're usually always connected or near a mall."}
{"text":"Lobster queso was good but not that thick queso your used to. Also if you like your steak well order it Med well, I ordered a well steak (yeah I know... Why would info that right?) and it came back dry. 

Good news they have excellent service, they made it again and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Love their steaks and the restaurant is cool and trendy yet family friendly. Unsure of which sauces to pick for your steak? Just ask and they'll let you sample the various options. They want to make sure they get your order right! Never a long wait and they allow you to reserve online which is excellent."}
{"text":"Oh Firebirds. My heart is yours. Seriously. This place is my favorite to get steak. The prices are really good if you want a decent sized steak with no fuss. I have been here twice for steak and it's always been cooked to my liking and service was tremendous. Their mashed potatoes are creamy and delicious. They also give complimentary fresh bread and butter which is appreciated. Their strawberry lemonade is also very good, albeit a little too sweet. I'm going come back over and over again, for sure."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. With a reservation our party of 8 we were seated immediately. Trout was excellent. I was amazed at the size of the portion. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The wait times are awful during busy times. I've served for years but have never seen anything this bad. Every time, too! We've given up at this point. The last time we were there, our server was so busy and impatient with us... when we asked to add shrimp to our order (upsell!) she scoffed as she said she'd add them. We were baffled why she would be mad for upping the bill. Then, to top it all off, the GM is an arrogant ass who obviously hates his life. Justin, Jason, something like that. He proceeded to talk in bad taste about his staff to our entire table, essentially saying they were all worthless and if he were doing everything, there would be no excruciating wait times, undercooked/raw shrimp being served... shall I go on? We mentioned one of the burgers was extremely overcooked and he said, \"well, we're not exactly known for our burgers\" and walked away. We paid the outrageous $200+ bill and left as soon as we could. 

Save yourself a lot of time, money, and go elsewhere unless you enjoy the joys described above. And enjoy the guaranteed mandatory table touch time with the best GM in town!"}
{"text":"The food and service were EXCELLENT!  We were the first ones in the restaurant on last Saturday and we had lots of refills and fresh bread!  The manager even came around to make sure everything was to our liking...even though she's an Eagle's fan (HA HA)!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat that would feed the appetite but not break the budget! This is it. My salad with the grilled tenderloins is wonderful as well as my loaded baked potato! Short wait but well worth it. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thia is our first time eating at this restaurant and the placed just sucks. One star for the mediocre service and another star for the baked potato that was actually good. I'm mostly rating this based on the food. I got the cilantro chicken breast with mashed potatoes. The only okay thing on my plate were the mash potatoes (you can't really go wrong with mash potatoes). I couldn't taste any cilantro on my extremely dried up, over cooked chicken breast. And the only evidence of cilantro I saw was from the garnish. My fiancé had prime ribs with a baked potato. The flavor  of the rib was \"decent\". The baked potato has to be the best thing on our plates. We didn't get refills for our drinks until the end of dinner after we paid. I didn't have enough water to wash down the dried chicken. We never even got our complementary bread at the beginning of the dinner either."}
{"text":"This is a chain, but I wouldn't have thought it. My meal was very good and the service was excellent. I don't drink alcohol, but it's a wine bar. Seemed like they had a big selection. Definitely worth trying once."}
{"text":"The prime rib was excellent as always. The staff was very personal and enjoyable. The service was also excellent, especially with it being restaurant week. One of our families favorites!"}
{"text":"this place is good I had the prime rib it was OK at best my son a the salmon it was cook to perfection next time I'll get that tortilla soup was one of the best in a long time the service was 5 star all the way"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and I agree with the another poster here that this an expensive place, most of what you are paying for is atmosphere in my opinion. I do not think the patio area is all that great, but it is not bad either.

Not saying the food is bad, but I did not love it, or hate it. It was ok. Service was excellent though.

My second time dining here and I prefer the Keg which is close by in the same mall area in Chandler."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here after a not so good first time and this was by far the best service and experience. Krista was very friendly and gave great service. I had the Ahi appetizer which was very good, excellent prime rib and of course the carrot cake which is my weakness and it was very good. Glad to have came back and enjoyed great service and food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The Cesar salad was a little heavy on the dressing but everything else was excellent!  We will be coming back!  Thanks for the VIP invite!"}
{"text":"Great food little pricey but if you wanted steak I think this place is worth it ! I've  thinking about coming back here every time I go to a different seak place so It must've made a good impression!!!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Firebirds twice, both on a Saturday afternoon (before 6pm).  My first time was exceptional.  It was a double date night.  We've heard so much about their smoked wings and the steak so that's exactly what we had out hearts on trying.  We all started with wedge salads and the Firebirds signature salads.  They were crazy good!  We moved on to the smoked chicken wings for an appetizer.  They were as good as everyone made them out to be.  Smoked to perfection!  

The cuts of steaks were pretty big so my date and I shared an entrée.  A filet mignon, loaded baked potato and asparagus (I think ... I'm almost for sure).  Everything was out of this world good!  No issues, no complaints! This was about a year ago.  Fast forward to about 3 months ago I dined at Firebirds again ... this time with a large party (10, including kids).  The dining experience wasn't nearly as nice as it was when I went on a date night.  When I dined with the large party 3 months ago we were neglected.  Our meals all came out at different times and took forever.  This time I ordered salmon, my friend ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Pass on it!  Pass on the meatloaf!  It was salty, kinda dry, the green beans were hard.  They could have been steamed a little longer.  

Because I had such a good dining experience the first go 'round, I'm definitely going to try it again solo or on a date night.  Definitely not as a group!"}
{"text":"Ok. Nothing great and nothing bad. The bread was good. The service was ok. Probably not a place we will drive from Surprise for again. The food at Longhorn is better ... And closer."}
{"text":"Really good service and atmosphere.  Food was good, but over-spiced and definitely pricy.  I would go back, just not very often."}
{"text":"This was a nice chain-type restaurant. My elderly inlaws loved it. Things were a little salty like most chain restaurant food and the portions are huge. If you take home leftover mashed potatoes they take a long time in the microwave to make them pliable again, and that's when you realize you ate a whole lot of butter/oil last night. Service was great - upbeat nice kids. We noted it was my MIL's birthday on the reservation, ordered a slice of cake for her and it would have been nice if they stuck a candle in it though."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even more AMAZING staff. Dani and Mary are the best. Always happy and always smiling. The prime rib and Delmanico are delightful"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic birthday dinner last night and our waiter Daniel was very awesome.  We had the three course dinner special as part of Restaurant Week.  Lobster Carne appetizer was the best.  Linguini with Shrimp and Salmon for me and Filet for my wife.  Desserts we had to take home but a great finish to the meal.  Timing for all courses was perfect.  Highly recommended spot and a new regular for us!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it happened to be for a good friend's birthday. We had a party of 11 and our waitress was very patient with us and she was super nice!! 

I ordered the coconut shrimp, which came with steak fries, tortilla slaw - but I opted out of the slaw and just went with extra steak fries. It was big portions, so you definitely get your money's worth! I like how they put the coconut sauce on the side, so it wouldn't be soggy or too much. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was that the breaded shrimp almost seemed like it was burnt. Other than it, everything was really good! The fries were perfect and not too salty."}
{"text":"Always good food and prompt service here. Get there before the lunch rush! They are always busy."}
{"text":"Good food, love the salmon and vegetables. Always had great service here. I was more of a regular when I worked lived in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy. Many gluten-free options. Can't wait to come back to try some gf soups. Service was good and the food was so good. Then again I love steak but it was cooked exactly how I like."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I loved it! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time together and t was so good! I got the filet kabob with mashed potatoes and a baked potato and it was some of the best filet I had ever had and Steven had the 7 ounce filet mignon and he said it was absolutely perfect! We also had a glass of Seven Oaks Cabernet which was delicious and had a nice finish. We finished up with brownie and our server was awesome and we loved that it didn't cost and arm and a leg for s fancy dinner! Can't wait to go back and bring the family here!"}
{"text":"We have no complaints with the service or the food however....if a group of friends are gathering together, this might not be the place for you. 
We met friends for dinner, a party of 8.  We had reservations, made a week in advance. When we arrived I asked if we could be seated away from the main crowd. I was told our table was ready and we were taken to a large round table in the middle section.  The restaurant was so noisy we were unable to carry on a conversation with one another and the large round table made it impossible to talk to anyone seated across the table.  Very disappointing.  Other larger parties were seated at long rectangular tables that were not as wide making it easier to talk to one another. Unfortunately we were not given that option.  We all agreed we would not go back to Firebirds as a group again."}
{"text":"Not really worth the trip.  I ordered a Bombay Sapphire and Tonic and it was watered down and the tonic water was flat.   Neither the appetizer nor entree were memorable.  The bill was far too high for the quality of food.  Parking was also a hassle.
We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The food is awesome. This is one of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area. I recommend the American Kobe Beef Meatloaf with the garlic mashed potatoes. I've been living here for almost 4 years and never had a chance to come here. Let's just say I'm glad I made it."}
{"text":"I literally NEVER eat steak unless my grandmother makes it. No other place can satisfy me bc I am not a meat eater it sorta freaks me out. But the pepper rubbed sirloin I had was really really good and my boyfriend got the delmonico because they ran out of the prime rib he lives for but this was a great replacement for him. That was probably the only downfall of our first time visiting since we chose this place for him to have the prime rib but it was a great experience our server Drake was great and I believe it was the manager that came to our table and told us about the prime rib that they usually keep a few pieces in case someone really wants the prime rib but he didn't get it bc of the temperature so he went for the delmonico since he loves rare steak. So for steak eaters it's a must try place (pricey so come for occasions) and there were some great seafood options for me but I figured I would try a steak and I was very satisfied. Def coming again."}
{"text":"Meh. Have been wanting to come here since we moved to this area a few months ago but both times we've tried there has been like 1.5-2 hour wait. Last weekend we made an opentable reservation last. I think they don't understand what reservations are because we got handed a buzzer just like everyone else and we saw multiple people going up to the hostess desk complaining about this very thing. People don't make a reservation just to be given a buzzer as if we had just walked in the door. This place was packed even at 830/9pm. I thought for some reason thought this was a more high end place but there were people wearing sweatpants and t shirts while dining. Once we were seated things were fine. Our waitress (Steph) was seriously so sweet and personable and attentive. Spicy shrimp appetizer was SO good. We had two nice glasses of wine. I had the Mahi, good but I won't rush back just for that. My husband had a strip. Ordered medium but came out more on the rare side (cold and red). We hate to do this but just aren't comfortable eating it cooked that way, it had to be sent back. Our waitress was wonderful about it and when it came back out more pink than red he was happy. Also we did see managers bussing food and pitching in which is always nice to see and appreciated. Overall OK experience but I can think of other places I'd rather spend over $100 on dinner for two."}
{"text":"Always amazing food. Usually the service is great although our last server was not spectacular by any means. Definitely recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"1st time here. Amazing. Attention to detail. Look at my pic of regular lemonade (sugar around the glass). Omg, it's the best lemonade I have ever had in my life. Mac n cheese was great for the kids and they even got an prep that made them happy!  Bread is amazingly warm, soft on the inside and crusty in the outside. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience last night. I get one night a week to go out with my wife. We checked in with the hostess and asked for first available. Afternoon  a 30 minute wait and 4 other couples that came in and told an hour wait, they all got seated ahead of us. When my wife questioned the hostess she was told again 30 minutes. Unfortunately everywhere in the restraunt in the area was packed so decided to wait and two more couples came in and were seated ahead of us, without reservations. An opening came at the bar so my wife and I went there to get something to drink and we finally ordered. The barkeep got the manager which offers us a \" opportunity to have a better experience\", and left me his card and what looked to be some discount card. After we got an average food order I paid and we left leaving his cards on the bar. This place has horrible customer service and ruined my one night out with my wife. I will never forgive them or go back."}
{"text":"I wasn't familiar with Firebirds, but gave it a try since so many alternatives were closed after seeing a late movie.  I decided upon the 9 oz. filet & crab cake special, but when it arrived the filet was slightly cold and tasted of smoke, although the meat was very tender.  What really disappointed me was the crab cake being about the size of a silver dollar, easily the smallest I've ever been served, and even at that size it was somehow light on crabmeat.  The accompanying mashed potatoes were also quite cold and lumpy.  Had the \"special\" been some kind of reduced price then the ridiculously small portion might have been understandable, but it was quite expensive.  

The one positive I will say is that the service was very good, as the waitress was very attentive and came by to check regularly without being obtrusive.  Still, it's definitely not somewhere I will ever dine again and I will discourage any friends from doing so should they go to that particular theater."}
{"text":"This place is a nice date spot...It was night when i went so the lights were low and there were candles lit and the fireplace was crackling, very nice. The food was very good, but will say that my first plate of pasta was a tad bit salty but they quickly corrected it by giving me a fresh place and they even Cooped my salad.  So over all its a a 4 out of 5 from me"}
{"text":"I brought my Wife here for her birthday. She had a hand carved 16 oz Prime Rib, that she said was the best Prime Rib she had ever tasted. I had Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon covered with a Blue Cheese Cream Sauce that tasted amazing. But the real star of the show was a piece of Creme Brulee Cheesecake that was out of this world. Dear Firebirds ~ YOU ROCK !"}
{"text":"Great date night spot, the ambience is cozy and comfortable. I had the ribeye and my wife had the filet mignon and clam chowder soup, everything tasted Amazing! The steaks were absolutely the best! Waited 20-30 min for a table on a Thursday evening, but the bar was sufficient for the wait. We loved it, recommend it, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on spring break last week and took all the 5-star ratings as a good choice for dinner! 

We sat outside and it was warm, the low top seats however were pretty uncomfortable. There were no high top tables available so we made due and I really didn't even mind it too much.

Our server was Nadine and she was so sweet, always making sure we had everything we needed. We started with the Lobster Queso dip and Oh. My. Gosh. It will literally change your entire life, because it did mine! The chips were a little salty, so ask for no salt if you're not into it, but I still ate every single one. 

My mom and I both ordered the steak salad and my dad ordered the pork Mac and cheese (??) I can't remember exactly what it's called but it was pork in Mac n cheese. You'd think it wouldn't be very good but it was actually delicious! Our steak salads were so good, perfect amount of dressing and fixings. 

We were stuffed but decided to get cheesecake Togo. We got the creme brûlée cheesecake and woah, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself but was forced to share with my parents (aw man). 

All in all it was great food, great atmosphere, great service! If they had one in Washington I'd be a regular, but I'll always definitely choose Firebirds when in Arizona!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We come here once a month or so, for no reason, other than we love the service and the food. Last time we were here, we had a fantastic service from Shawn (sp). He was very attentive,  genuine,  and knowledgeable. He introduced me to \"a rare plus\" !  I loved my steak!!! It was cooked so perfect, just the way I like it.  Then, the manager, James. He was very nice, extremely friendly, and very personable. He visited with us for a good while. He genuinely cared about us as customers.   I would go back again and again."}
{"text":"I chose Firebirds for a surprise birthday dinner for my partner and I.  Neither of us had been there, but I thought it would be perfect because of the rave reviews. First, I had called and reserved a table.  I also let them know that its a birthday and she told me they provided a birthday dessert.  Come to find out, that birthday dessert was put on our bill and I wasn't about to dispute the charge in front of the birthday person either, so I just paid it.  The food was ok, my pasta was good but definitely not worth $18. My partner ordered the prime rib.  After waiting 45 minutes, our beers long empty we finally asked and the waitress walked right over to the food area and returned with our food within a minute, so I assume the food sat there for some time.  His $25 prime rib was cold and loaded potato looked like it had sat out all night.  I was less than impressed with a pricey meal looking the way it did.  The waitress is really what did us in.  She kept coughing while talking to us.  Then she would disappear until we could track someone else down.  If this wouldn't have been an $82 dollar meal, we wouldn't have minded so much.  But when you pay that kind of money for TWO people, you expect good service and good food.   Maybe it was an off night for them.  Either way, I don't think we will go back and risk another $82 on mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Is it too much to expect clean silverware? Especially at a place with linens. I hate when this sets the tone for the meal. Bread plate was also dirty. Called the manager over to let him know, and he was very apologetic. Genuinely interested in remedying the situation and not making excuses. Much appreciated. 

On the upside, food was great, as usual. There's even Mahi on the kids menu!"}
{"text":"The double black diamond martini is worth five stars alone....those suckers are dangerously delicious.

The service, ambiance, and food here are always fantastic. 

Last time I was here (10/24), my steak was very over salted and my salad was hideously overdressed, but I won't hold it against this place."}
{"text":"I used to love firebirds when they first opened. My sister and I would go to the south-park location and sit on the patio with a glass of wine. This location is convenient  if you're in the north-lake mall and want to grab something nicer than the food court. The food is decent. Not outstanding, but definitely three stars. I like the strawberry and shrimp salad and stick to that every time I go. My husband has tried many of their steak options and really isn't a fan. They're not worth the money. The burger is alright, but nothing to write home about. If you're going to try a sandwich, the french dip is really yummy! Their cocktails and wines deserve four stars! But the food is a solid three."}
{"text":"Went in to grab a bite and Everything was Delish. The waiter (Bruce, if I recall his name correctly) served us as we sat in the bar area), was exceptional. He was not only knowledgeable about their menu but he was genuine. We love trying new places and because of his attitude, it makes us want to come back to the city and bring our family and friends to the restaurant. The Salad was fresh and flavorful. Wish one was in my area of the world."}
{"text":"Really like the atmosphere and food here.  High quality food and drinks at reasonable prices.  Love sitting in the bar area and enjoying the setting.  The bartenders are very friendly and management seems to be highly interested in ensuring our visit was perfect all around.  And best loaded baked potato around!  Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"\"Proper\"

That's the first word that comes to mind when reflecting on my experience here last night.  Mainly, that's the first word that comes to mind because that is how Jordan (one of my co-workers) would describe the steak that I ate.  It was most certainly a proper ribeye in every sense of the word.

I rolled in late (as in 40-minutes before closing late) with a group of classmates and we were all hungry and thirsty.  The kind of hungry and thirsty you can only get from a nice, drawn-out corporate training group project that you work on in a hotel lobby from the time your class ends until about 9pm.  Yep, the situation definitely called for a nice expense account ribeye!

My steak was ordered medium rare and arrived exactly medium rare.  From the first bite to the last, I was struck by the incredible wood-fired grill flavor imbued in the meat.  Every single bite had that delicious smokiness!  The meat itself was middle of the road but that was to be expected given the price point.  The smokiness was what carried the day!

My steak came with their loaded baked potato (also good) and a piece of key lime pie.  Actually, it wasn't described that way on the menu but I decided it was a simple editorial error and asked the waiter to make it right."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever. The customer service is fantastic and their food is better. I love this place! Salads are so fresh. Any are good, but do try their house salad. I always order the filet wth the baked potato. I used to order the shrimp to go with it, but it is just too salty. My husband and son love, love, love the smokehouse burger."}
{"text":"Hello AZ ... Out on the town with friends and I would have loved to give FB a 5 star rating but service was a disappointment. 
The food , company , and atmosphere terrific!!! Service sad!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice in the past year, while visiting relatives in the area. The food and service is excellent and the atmosphere great. While this place os billed as a steakhouse, their fish is truly amazing. The trout, Mahi Mahi and salmon are all very delicious. I wish we had this Restaurant closer to where we live."}
{"text":"Good choice for wood fired meals and simple yet tasty flavors. I like this place for dinner or lunch if you want a smoky flavored salmon, delicious Parmesan mashed potatoes and the fried spinach. It's better food than most chains and consistently delicious. The coconut shrimp app is my fave with the slightly spicy chutney and slaw. While it is not ground breaking cuisine, I enjoy the flavors and the awesome service. I've been a bunch and always had a great meal and excellent waiters."}
{"text":"Stopped here during the week for lunch. I had signed up for their email club and received a $10 coupon towards lunch or dinner. 

We were seated right away. The inside is very open with high beamed ceilings. A large stone wall with a fireplace. It has a bit of a lodge feel.

I had checked the website ahead of time to see what was on the menu. Quite a bit to chose from for lunch. I originally was going to get the grilled tenderloin salad until I saw it was $15.95. That's a little more than I care to pay for a lunch salad. We decided on a cheeseburger with fries and the cilantro-grilled chicken breast with sauteed spinach. Both were good. The sauce on the chicken had a great flavor. The portion size of chicken was small. Spinach was tasty but too salty. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter was very nice. Quick with refills. 

I can only give three stars for the food. It was good but nothing exceptional. Four stars for service and atmosphere. Overall, four stars."}
{"text":"The GRAND Re-Opening event at this Firebirds location in SouthPark was A1. I along with nine other Yelp Elite were choose to attend this event that was advertised as live music, raffles, passed appetizers, etc.. from 6pm - 9pm.

I arrived at 5:58pm and after calling my husband to check his ETA I found that he was about 15mins away so I decide to head in and try to get a seat before the rush. Well Low and Behold the RUSH had already started. Upon entering there was a table where you enter yourself into the raffle for a chance to win dinner for 4 or dinner and a movie for two. You also were directed to grab a gift bag. I completed a form for myself and my husband and grabbed two bags. I walked through the bar and didn't see one familiar Yelp face so I went back to inquire if the Yelp meet up was in the bar and the host smiled and said YES. I then turned around and saw a familiar face Ms. Rah Rah. She was sipping a Dirty Girl martini and a little confused as she inquired about the email and the bartender said everything was discounted but nothing comp. I went back to my email and noticed that Becky directed me to introduce myself to A.J when onsite so Rah Rah and I found AJ. He was amazing and he is the new GM for this place. He was a really great guy and took great care of us. I had a Sex in the Queen City, my hubby had Ginger beer and collectively we ordered one of each of the seven appetizers (it was 4 of us) to taste. 

The pass appetizers started coming once the order was placed and unfortunately everything consisted of MEAT (land animal) which is where my disconnect came into play. I'm a pescaterian (seafood only) but I'm not to the point that I can't eat something that has a certain meat near it like chicken or turkey. I absolutely can't eat anything touching or associated with Pork. 

Our appetizer spread consisted of the following with flavor ratings 
Coconut Shrimp - Super crisp and flavorful. The slaw was to die for and the sauce the shrimp was sitting atop. Yum and definitely did into that slaw

Onion rings with ranch - The onion rings were fried perfectly and the breading was seasoned to the T. They were tasty without the ranch but the range provided additional flavor 

CrabCake - Lucky for this dish it was paired with that SUPER SLAW from earlier. Having lived in MD for a shortwhile and eating the BEST car cakes EVER it's hard to really enjoy a CrabCake anywhere else. This one was OK

Lobster Queso - Yum :-) Does that explain this dish. I mean the chips were freshly fried and the Queso was so warm and filled with chunks of lobster 

Ahi Tuna - The tuna was paired with a great tasting salad. It was OK as far as tuna is concerned but the salad made it worth my while. I think some ginger and a drizzle of a sweet or Thai chili sauce would set this dish off as the peanut drizzle wasn't robust enough.

Smoked chicken - My husband and the others who ate the chicken said it was too salty but they appreciated the fact that it wasn't breaded and fries well.

Chicken quesadilla - My husband and the others LOVED these, they were stuffed with shredded chicken breast and veggies and very fulfilling 

Overall WE WERE STUFFED & had an amazing time. We look forward to visiting again this time with our children in tow."}
{"text":"Went here for a steak.  Wound up getting the steak and lobster.  They give you free bread.  But in the middle I noticed a green cploration, looked like mold but was likely a spice.  The bread had a very pungent odor.

Their prices are very high and pretentious.  But the steak was a thick sirloin that was unevenly cooked.  I asked for medium and the steak came out half rare and blue in the middle.  Hardly any seasoning to speak of.  The lobster was mediocre.  Tough, not all that flavorful.  Huge waste of 50 something bucks.

Could've done better at Applebees.

Staff was very friendly though, in fact when I asked for a straw, she served my straw on a plate...


Update:  Their management reached out to me and asked if I would give it another whirl.  Since they obviously care about their customers, I will give them a second try when I return to the area.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Thank you for your Veterans Day celebration.  My wife brought us to.  We had a great time and very pleasant evening.  We enjoyed the food and wait staff was great.  Steak a little too well done for me (ordered medium rare.)   But great flavor.  The cards from the local school made my day 
Thank you"}
{"text":"I have lived and worked close to the Ballantyne area for at least five years and have yet to actually dine in Firebirds until tonight. (I have gotten to-go a few times.) I think it may be because their menu is pretty expensive and not so extensive and the restaurant seems a little uppity, however I had won a gift card in a contest so thought tonight would be a great night to try it out. Love the atmostphere, not uppity at all, on the high end of casual - I imagine it may be a little more formal on weekend evenings. We went in around 7:30 which was towards the end of their peak time as the tables were full but most were paying their checks - the hostess was nice, and the waitress was nice also. Then a big group came in and took a lot of our waitress' attention and therefore we did not receive the beer we had ordered and the bread she told us was coming until much later. TOTALLY not a big deal. We received our food - the AMERICAN KOBE BEEF MEATLOAF, SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS and PORTABELLA SANDWICH all of which were really good. As we were getting ready to pay our check, our original waitress returned (others had assisted us with bringing out the food, etc.) and we could tell she felt really bad thought there really was no need to. The manager (I'm assuming), came over and informed us that he would be taking the beer off the check and he was really sorry for the hiccups, even though the beer and bread were long gone in our minds. A+ for service! We most likely will be going back, but I feel their prices should be slightly lower."}
{"text":"Food was well prepared and tasty(blue cheese filet & salmon). Service was good. Only problem is the place was loud so probably not good for quiet conversation. A little pricey @ $30-40 pp (we dont drink). All in all a delicious meal."}
{"text":"This place was beyond expectations. Food great service great prime rib best I've had in a long time. Definitely a must go. Don't let the mall scare you away complimentary valet."}
{"text":"My favorites include the salads. Nice serving with a good mix of fresh lettuces and vegetables. Always add a protein with a good selection and willing to prepare to your liking. Enjoy the atmosphere and service is good. The noise level is high, am guessing it is from the design of the interior which I really like as it reminds of being in a comfortable setting. It is a fine trade off- worth the visit."}
{"text":"The prime rib which is supposedly their best dish, was a bit salty.  It didn't help that they ran out of rare meat.  They only had medium rare.  The horseradish which was provided with the dish was not potent at all.  Even the straight horseradish had absolutely no impact.  The food was edible, but definitely not a place to go back to."}
{"text":"You know, the only reason why this isn't getting 1 star is because the service was friendly. Not fast--but friendly. My husband and I had visited before. But not in a while, and probably never for lunch. 

We walked in and the hostess was talking to another customer on the phone, and didn't even acknowledge us with a nod or a hand covering the phone and a whispered \"I'll be right with you.\" Fine--sure. No one else was around and it was lunch time. No big. But telling for things to come.

Everything was clean, and we placed our order after not too long of a wait. Things went downhill from there.

The salad was positively COATED in dressing. They brought me out a cup of ketchup, then, inexplicably, someone came out to the table, grabbed it without saying anything, but left it there (?). They never brought us the bread they asked us if we wanted (and we responded in the positive). To their credit, they did ask us if they ever brought us bread out, and asked us if we wanted any (but this was after they brought us our meal out), which we declined since our food was already there. Then the food itself--granted, the price was low (11ish for burgers). There was a small (tiny) pile of fries on each plate with our burgers (I'm guessing sweet potato waffle fries are more expensive than steak fries because my husband had maybe 5 on his plate). The burgers themselves were literally dripping with grease. I took mine off the bun at one point--and the bun was completely brown for soaking up all the grease it could possibly stand. When I went to hand my plate to the server at the end of the meal, the bottom of the plate was also coated in grease. 

Not sure if it's because it's a holiday weekend and the usual crew are out at the beach or something, and not sure if because it was lunch, they put their \"C\" team on, but it's very unlikely we'll be darkening their doorstep again."}
{"text":"Took a chance and was NOT disappointed! The pineapple martini's are so delicious, and I don't even like martini's! The pineapple salsa chicken with the cauliflower mash was super tasty!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town, 4-6:30, so be quick about it. I like their specially drinks and their happy wine is good quality! What really seals it are the HH food selections, same stuff and quality as regular menu. This is a good place!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for four, and called to add an additional person that decided to join us for a 5:15 p.m. reservation. The manager came on the line after being put on hold for five minutes, and rudely stated that they can't accommodate that change. Really?! I've worked in the restaurant industry as a manager for over ten years in Las Vegas (which has significantly higher sales volume than Peoria) and that is simply inefficiency and ignorance at its best. We will be taking our business elsewhere. I'm incredibly disappointed with the lack of professionalism of a restaurant that I previously frequented while in town. It is laughable that the manager was not able to accommodate an additional person with a three hour notice."}
{"text":"Went last night with the boyfriend and my aunt... Burger was decent, but all of the burgers are between $11 and $15 dollars. I hate paying that much for a cheeseburger! I got the durango, which I was expecting to have a kick, with the chilies and pepper jack cheese... but they forgot the chilies and you couldn't really taste the cheese at all. The portion of fries was truly delicious, just wish there were more then 8 fries. Coleslaw was very dry... Skip it. The bread they bring is amazing, we definitely asked for seconds. My boyfriend had the French dip and ate every last bite. My aunt had the spinach salad and it was huge and delicious. The wait staff was excellent, the hostess was adorable and very sweet. Our waitress was talkative and helpful without being over bearing or pushy, and the chocolate brownie is a for sure thing... Especially when dipped in the sea salt caramel. The staff and the dessert almost pushed me to 4 stars... But the portions and the prices were a little too gourmet for this American grill."}
{"text":"We have been here twice this week. The Food is really amazing. And the service is excellent. One of our new favorite spots for sure."}
{"text":"Had an excellent lunch at the bar.  Two of us had a couple of glasses of wine, two salads and soups.  Everything was good except the Woodfire Shrimp appetizer which was pretty small and not really impressive from presentation or taste perspective.  Little pricey at $100 for lunch, but service and ambiance made it worth while."}
{"text":"Food and our server was excellent but I can't say the same about the manager and hostess! I believe the managers' name is Pedro and the only reason I know that is because he spent a lot of time at the table next to us but never stopped by to ask how our experience was. I felt a little neglected and lacked the full Firebirds experience. In regards to the hostess Melissa. She ignored my son and I when we walked in and helped another gentleman and family as we patiently waited our turn even though we were there first. How sad, this place lacks first and lasting impression! We will be back but hopefully Pedro and Melissa will not be working and neglecting customers!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  My family was in town visiting and we decided to try a new place close to home.  The bar area was very impressive when walking through the front door.  I had a new york strip.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was so juicy.  I also had a loaded baked potato and caesar salad.  All were incredible.  It was also half off wine night  (Monday) which made it that much more perfect for me.  The rest of the table enjoyed various steak salad, Ahi tuna, and steak.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"I was craving a steak for lunch and I had always been curious about this steakhouse at Northlake Mall in Charlotte, NC so I decided to give it try. I ordered the house ribeye and it was spectacular. The steak, baked potato, and bread were all superb. I will definitely be eating here again, and I will also be recommending it to all my friends and business associates as well. One of the best steaks you will find around the Northlake Mall area, and it's open for lunch. Wish they had an entrance from the inside of the mall, but other than that this place is great."}
{"text":"First off let me say we love Firebirds! However this location is simply not up to par.  We usually go to the the Rea Rd location (highly recommend) but they didn't have a table for our timeframe tonight.   First off we were seated and we sat and sat and sat before our server finally came to take our drink order.  She asked if we were ready to order food (to which we said yes) and she said be right back. Fast forward 10 more minutes and my husband gets his beer and we finally order.  My filet kabob (which I ordered Medium came out well done). It was tough and dry.  She was impossible to flag down so I just suffered through.  The \"veggies\" were mostly tomatoes and raw red onion.  My side of broccoli was good.  I am giving them 2 stars because my husbands steak was marvelous (but his green beans were completely unseasoned).  It was a very disappointing experience, which is sad considering it was a very rare date night.  We will be sticking with our regular Firebirds from now on.

*we returned here tonight to try again.  Food was fantastic and our service was almost good. That is until she had another table sat.  It took us longer to pay than it did to eat.  Finally someone else took pity on us and rang us out.  It should never be that difficult to pay.  Feel like they just dropped the ball.  So frustrating."}
{"text":"This is by far one of our favorite places to eat.  It is always spot on.  Best chicken pasta and filet we have eaten in the area.  We will always go there when we want to splurge."}
{"text":"Good food, romantic atmosphere and amazing staff. Definitely recommend this place to all my friends looking for a date night"}
{"text":"LOVE FIREBIRDS! Fantastic food. Great fish, steak, prime rib. Love their salads!!! So good!!!! Everything on the menu is good. Nothing is bad. They have a great bar area at the front of the restaurant. Beautifully designed and well appointed, this place is a feast for the eyes too! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this restaurant since going to the Tucson location. We go about twice a year because it is somewhat close to our house. The service is great and the food is of high quality and fast. It is popular especially during snowbird season so I would highly recommend making a reservation. Tonight we sat at the bar. The happy hour seemed worthwhile but just ate dinner tonight. My husband had the Durango burger and I had the blt salad and chicken corn chowder soup. Both meals were very good. The bread they bring before the meal is always fresh and hot. We were too full for dessert."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Nothing special or out of the ordinary except for the fried spinach that comes with one of the salmon dishes. That was really interesting but I'm  not sure I would eat more than a couple bites. I had the coconut shrimp and it wasn't the best I've had. I couldn't taste the coconut and the breading was too thick. They were just okay. The service was just okay, too. There were nine of us and they only brought one loaf of bread. They kept saying the bread was baking but we saw several other tables get their bread. We were all done eating when they finally brought a second loaf. I doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ from California....and came here again. I love this place! Was here a year ago and this place is still exceptional. Brought wife for her birthday along with my mom. We had the coconut shrimp and crab cake appetizers.  (both were outstanding) Also the 9 oz Filet was very tasty along with the fully loaded baked potato.  All that said, the reason I love this place is their customer service. Megan was our server and she was exceptional. She recommended cocktails (which we had) and consistently checked on us. She is cheerful, happy and loves her job. She should be the manager AND she should be training customer service. Rock on Megan! and Rock on Firebirds!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an understaffed, unmanaged and disorganized restaurant, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"We've been regulars at the Chandler location for years so had to visit the new Gilbert location. As good as the Chandler location has been, the new Gilbert location has taken it up a notch. Our server, Tina, was excellent from start to finish. Not in our face but always close by and attentive. Everyone was friendly from the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out. We had a steak and a burger both cooked to absolute juicy perfection at medium rare which is tough to get at most restaurants. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The early bird dinners are really good for $16.99
and you want to order the mixed greens salad with the cilantro vinegar dressing. It to die for."}
{"text":"This wsa the second time eating here.  This trip I had the kobe meatloaf with a gravy and mash potatoes.  The food was good.  The meat loaf resembled more of a Salisbury steak in my opinion.  The gravy was really rich and flavourful.  It was a good portion too.  The service was good too.  I like this place and will go back and try a different entrée."}
{"text":"The hostess informed us the wait would be an hour and a half. If we had actually waited that long to be seated, this review would be a lot worse based on the flavors of the evening. Luckily, my father is a bar table finding ninja. The food was average. I've had a good steak at Firebirds before. Tonight showed me another side. At this price point, I expect two identically ordered steaks to come out the same temperature. Not the case. And the sautéed spinach made me wish I'd opted for the vegetable medley. 

Friday/Saturday nights might be fast paced, but these aren't Applebee's prices ...the rush should go just as smoothly as the Wednesday night lull IMHO. Our waitress was very friendly, but spaced out on a few things. Overall it wasn't at all terrible, but it certainly wasn't worth the money, and I don't intend to return."}
{"text":"Bar seating 
Little forgotten early on but not a big deal.
Great bread to munch on (free appetizer)
Prime rib  (if your from around here and remember the real River Rat...almost as good!) cut it with a fork 
Firebird's Chicken Pasta yum the way they shave the chicken and the slight kick in the sauce.
Will come back and the South Park location!! 
GREAT food, great atmosphere!
OH...I'm always carrying a sweater because restaurants make the temp indoors like a fridge during summer, not the case here, fantastic! Comfortable! Ladies can dress for the season outdoors and not freeze like its winter indoors!!"}
{"text":"Everything including the food and service were excellent.  My date was beautiful and made me look good. I would always recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best steak for the money in the area. The chile rubbed Delmonico steak is my go to. I wish the cut of meat was better but the flavor is there so I'm still very happy. Pay the few extra dollars and get yourself a decent steak at Firebirds."}
{"text":"I had the cilantro grilled chicken; some of the best chicken I've tasted. The mashed potatoes were also excellent. My husband and son both had the barbeque chicken sandwich and loved it. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Here's a five star spot food and service. I took my brother and his wife to dinner and Tommy have us the best service I've had in months. Great food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"It was a quick dinner after a long day of work - the misters on the outside patio were just great and really made it bearable outside. The staff was easy to work with and even though they brought the wrong dish to my boss, he took it in stride and they were really apologetic.

The chef brought the food for my other co-worker, one who has a number of food allergies and explained that he had made sure that they had taken all of those into consideration when preparing her dinner.

We didn't have to wait either - wine was really nice as well and they had some local Arizona brews on tap there.

Always loved the one in Durham, NC when I was back in Chapel Hill. Good to see the consistency."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times in the last 5 + years! It's always fabulous and we've even had a rehearsal wedding dinner at the location in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I have loved everything I've had here from their fresh salads to their tasty salmon plates. But the one thing you can't forget to try is their red sangria. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sold on this place. Given proximity to my office, people choose it fairly often for work events, but I can't really say I have had anything that is really memorable and I like. 

The lobster spinach dip is ok - in my opinion kind of bland. It's runny, and not super cheesy, looks like it was scooped out of a crock pot. There is very little lobster in it.

The crab cakes as well - just bland. Nothing to be excited about. There are 2 crab cakes and mountains of this ridiculous slaw.

The chicken quesadillas are, well, where's the cheese? 

The tenderloin salad, well, the meat was burnt tasting. 

I did have the tortilla soup once, and that was pretty good. The spinach salad that I also ordered was - just boring. I guess what I would say is this really is like an over-priced Applebees. 

The Smokehouse Chicken sandwich was super dry the time I got it, and well, I guess I expect something with \"smokehouse\" in the name to be smoked - suffice to say it is not.

I can't say that it is \"bad\", because it's not. It's just average. The service is pretty good..oh wait, and if you get the bread - that is pretty dang amazing. I highly recommend that. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall, I won't be going here by my own choice."}
{"text":"I've only come here on expense account funded dinners and lunches because this place is perfect for that. I you ever need a place to take a really big group of people, this place can accomodate but you probably need to make reservations in advance as it is a popular place. Service has always been very decent. Can't speak to the prices since it's usually some big boss footing the bill. I've come here enough to have tried most of the Firebirds Specialties - Wood Grilled Salmon, Steak Au Poivre, Pecan Crusted Trout, and American Kobe Meatloaf. All were pretty good though I think I've had the meatloaf more times than any of the others. They have salads and burgers as well - something for everyone. I think we once hung out at the bar area where they had these huge jars of pineapple slices as well - so this place accomodates pretty well if your party wants to still hang out after the meal is done and plates are cleared off the table. Parking - pretty big mall so you'll find a spot without a problem even if it isn't right next to the restaurant. I know I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  From the moment you sit down, the service is warm and friendly which is always a great start.  

They also bring warm crispy on the outside, nice and doughy on the inside bread with salted butter. Yummo!!

The food is top notch quality and always fresh and great.  The prices are perfect too!

I just don't understand why there isn't one of these on every corner like their sub-par competitors?"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for lunch.  But each time I walk away I feel like they should grease the doors so I can fit through the doorway.  The feel here is an Aspen lodge-themed version of Claim Jumper or Cheesecake Factory.  

The food here is OK and could be called Western with Southwest influences, but their strong suit seems to be more of the meat/potatoes specialties.  I usually get the french dip on toasted baguette with steak fries.  But my favorite here is probably the Durango burger - which is huge and comes with pepper jack cheese and jalapeno ranch.  I've had my eye on the lobster spinach queso for a while.  Need to order that next time.

The portions are huge, the restaurant is large, and the look of the place is very themed and corporate looking.   It's a good restaurant pick in the chain monotony that is 83rd and Bell, and definitely recommended if you're in the Peoria area.  But it's nothing I would go out my way for.  There's also another location in Chandler."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious! The salmon salad was so good. I haven't had salmon that good in a long time.  Chicken salad was great! Chili was sooo good.. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best happy hours I've been to (for quality food and price). The mini burgers are actually delicious, also had the orange martini and it was delicious... even the mint chocolate they give with the check is delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Food quality and service is always wonderful.  If we want a steak,  this is where we come!  Bring back the crab cake salad!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Firebirds - not only with the food but with the service. 

Service: Lauren A is an amazing waitress! Brought be a new lemonade before I had to ask and was on my last sip. Brought us ketchup before we could ask! Kept checking up on us from afar to see if we needed anything without needing to come over and interrupt the convo. Just perfect service - we were very impressed. 

Food: we got the Durango burger and Market Salad. The tots that came with the Durango were the BEST!!! The burger was a cooked to well (ordered medium) but was still very delicious. The market salad did not come up short either. The chicken was moist which i've not found common when the chicken is in strips for salads. And I swapped the dressing for cilantro lime - I will be coming back for that. Light and not too vinegary. 

We will be back soon to try dinner."}
{"text":"Had dinner here, and the food was just average. Nothing stood out that would make me come back. Had the Parmesan crusted fish and au gratin potatoes that weren't terrible, but just all right."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great service always, incredible food always and well priced. 
Their prime rib is always exceptional and their infused pineapple martini is one of the best drinks I've ever had in my life! The only negative is it's LOUD but I still
love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why people would leave bad scores.   Always awesome when I go.    My wife always subs her french fries with port wine mushrooms and they don't even charge extra.    Nice relaxing place and staff is always great.    Been there at least 20 times."}
{"text":"Food was average,
6/22/18 - Asked for Medium Burger, I got well done and dry.  Waited 10 min to get ketchup for the fries. The waitress is nice and friendly, but at times very busy and forgot our order. We got our bread closer to end of the meal ( we had to ASK ). Overall this was a bad experience, not planning future visits."}
{"text":"Blown away by the service. Ask for Joey as your server. He kept our drinks filled, he was charismatic, and answered all our questions; it was our first time. The food was phenomenal ! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Meh, it was just an okay visit. 

I think I've been a bit spoiled by the other location because this visit just didn't do it for me! 

I'd had a crappy day at work so liquor was required so I started with the Pomegranate martini which was super tasty! But my dinner was just a bit underwhelming. I ordered the Blue Cheese Filet and loaded baked potato. I ordered it medium well and it came out a little more well done than I liked, good thing it had the blue cheese sauce and mushrooms! The worse part was the dessert. I was especially disappointed with the chocolate cake it was just totally blah. I wouldn't recommend it and definitely will not be ordering it again. 

Oh Firebirds! I don't want to break up with you! I want to be a huge fan, but visits like this make it hard for me to keep loving you!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Best thing I got was the lobster and cheese dip. Good service. Wait was long for a Wednesday we waited 1 hour and half. I wouldn't wait that long again."}
{"text":"My first time at this place and I got the French dip and fries. I sampled my wife's steak as well. The food we had overall was tasty and worth going back for more. The atmosphere is open but not beer hall noisy. The custom drinks are good but seem a little light on alcohol content. Our waitress was super friendly, helpful and knew the menu. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I were able to share a meal because the portions are so big. The food is amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"A group of seven friends asked me to choose a restaurant for dinner, and based on Yelp reviews, I chose Firebirds. We were not disappointed (and I was relieved, since it's a big responsibility to be the \"chooser\"). Chris, the manager, was gracious about filling our request for a big table on the patio, although it's usually on a first-come basis. Our server, Darcy, was very patient with us--a bunch of old folks who couldn't make up their minds, had special requests, and then asked for split checks--all things I know servers cringe over. She also graciously took all the photos we asked her to! And the food was great--prime rib, salmon, swordfish--everything!  Thank you both--Chris and Darcy--for making a get-together of old friends such a pleasant occasion."}
{"text":"I went here for Happy Hour drinks ($5-7) and appetizers ($5-10) with friends. They have great prices on \"bar bites\" during happy hour, which includes tacos, sliders, dips (pimento cheese or crab), and a few other options. We went for the tacos which was a perfect choice for the three of us there, and I had the white sangria - sweet and delicious, then a Double Black Diamond signature drink with pineapple infused vodka. We had a fourth friend join and it turned into a dinner for us. We all ended up splitting meals: two of us split the beef tenderloin pasta and the other two split a burger. The restaurant nicely split the meals into two separate plates, which was great! The portions were perfect and the pasta was well prepared with red peppers and a green chile cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! Onion rings are amazing, service is always great. We go there once a week!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! The waiter was a little slow in coming to our table (although I didn't even notice it) and so he apologized profusely and then got the manager to come over who offered us a free appetizer for our wait. They were sure to give us extra attention the rest of the meal. Really great customer service! And the appetizer and food was great too!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our last visit Saturday night. This was (past tense) our favorite date night restaurant, as it used to be consistent and delicious. We hadn't been in over a year and it's clearly declined in quality. 
We ordered the center cut sirloins, neither were cooked properly and both of us had instant symptoms of food poisoning. The service was decent, but quality, and flavor were lacking. The Caesar salad and the bread was the best thing we had on this visit. Even their key lime pie was much smaller. Not worth the money. Time to find a new favorite. 

Update. Went in to redeem the scratcher and they refused to scratch it when it clearly states no purchase necessary. We won't be back. So unprofessional and ridiculous."}
{"text":"I took my family to Firebirds for a graduation dinner. Our waitress, Darcy, was awesome. The food was terrific, and we enjoyed the atmosphere.
Everything was perfect, and we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Been to Firebirds a couple of times, but after my last experience I had to write a review. 

Firebirds is a great option for steak dinner. It's on par with other Chandler steak houses (The Keg, Chop) in terms of quality, but at a better price. I brought my family (a group of 7 adults total) this past weekend and had a great time. My father and sister are not big steak eaters and both got fish based dishes and both were very happy. 

Because we had a larger group, I made sure to call ahead and make a reservation. They have a nice feature that send you a text with your reservation time. It also offers  the ability to cancel the reservation by text back. Once you get to the restaurant, they use the text based system as an alternative to a paging device. Nice touch. 

Food: Don't come here expecting a Maestros or Morton's type experience. This isn't that level of steakhouse. It is, however, a great option in the lower price range. Pretty sure every steak dinner was under $30. Quality is greater than Outback for not much more. 

Service: From the hostess to management, I was really impressed. Our table wasn't quite ready at 7:30 (our reserved time), but they did a nice job communicating that with us and our group didn't feel ignored. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our waitress certainly seemed to be new, but she was still able to get my answers and make the necessary adjustments. My wife ordered her filet medium-rare and received a steak that was medium-well. She's not one to complain, but I knew she wouldn't enjoy this so we asked if they could make her another one correctly. The manager working that night, Pedro I believe, not only came over to apologize but grabbed her plate and made sure himself that the steak was properly prepared this time. It was a very busy Friday night, so it's nice to see he cared that much. He also removed her meal from the bill, which was totally unnecessary, but still appreciated. When her second steak arrived medium-rare, my wife very much enjoyed it. 

I don't expect a restaurant to be perfect in order to get a 5 star review. I do, however, expect them to make things right if they make a mistake. Firebirds did that and more. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I had the salmon lunch plate with pecan green beans and mashed potato. All 3 items were the best I've had in many years.  The fresh baked bread was great too.  Service was excellent. It's not cheap but the food is worth it. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"*Really impressed this time*

Server: super knowledgeable, I was looking to see of the Caesar salad with their wood fired chicken is BBQ or tastes like wood & fire.  I told her it's hard to find a \"Cajun type chicken here in the USA\" for a Caesar.  I don't like the cold wet pink stuff.  (Yes, try and hold your laughter!).

She suggested their \"Rub\", and I was so amazed and loved it!  And they make their own creamy, garlicky dressing ...... and wait for it, their croutons are seasoned well!

Needless to say it was lovely.  For you spicy chicken ceasar lovers I suggest it.  (Note $8 Without chicken, add $7 with chicken).  Worth it.

My young mad had the kids wings (hot).  A little hot for him and he loves spice but overall with two side options a deal!

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Woah! I was a bit under dressed in my jeans and tank. The food was excellent. Steak so good, you'll wanna slap your Momma. No joke. A little pricey, but so good."}
{"text":"I went in at 4:30 with mom and dad, Father's day and all. The place was jam packed, of course. Server came with drinks quickly. Took our order shortly thereafter, then after asking whether we were ready for the good times to roll, The table was adorned with plates a many. I had the tenderloin medallions and veggies with sweet potato fries. There was some sort of Basalmic on the bottom of the plate, which I almost licked up after the idea was presented to me by the GM. Really attentive staff, and we were in and out before I even knew what happened.... I just don't know when I will return though."}
{"text":"Third time eating here. First bad experience. Food was awful. Service was worse. I will not be eat here again."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the service. 

Went for my niece's 18th birthday. Let the staff know of the special occasion when we made the reservation. No mention of it from the server at all. 

Our service was sub-par. Either the server was untrained or didn't care.  When we brought it up to the manager, he handled the feedback poorly.  He didn't apologize or express any concern. There was an adjustment to the bill - but any verbal response from the manager other than \"really?\" would have gone further. 

Lastly, ordered a different side than what was part of the dish. When I asked if I could substitute, I was told yes. A $3 upcharge was not mentioned.  I don't mind paying more but it's courtesy to inform of changes to the price. 

It's hard to believe that teenagers at in-n-out understand customer service better than this place.  I can see the problem is leadership. 

I give it two stars because the food was good.  Kudos to the chefs."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Firebirds for lunch on a Sunday. The hostess greeted and seated us right away. Our waiter came and got our drinks and we ordered an appetizer. Our drinks and hot appetizer came and it wasn't bad. The staff, resaurant was nice,  but the reason for the 2 stars is because of the lunch portions. I ordered a turkey sandwich which was basically just a regular turkey sandwich and my husband ordered the ribs. When he received his ribs, it was surprisingly small and basically all bones. The plate was huge and they piled on fries to make up the small rib portion. It's pretty disappointing considering we spent $60 on a lunch with very little food. I feel for the amount of money we spent, the quality and food portion would be a lot better. Again, the staff was friendly but food was so-so. The complimentary bread was good though."}
{"text":"We took our girlfriend out for her birthday. The wait staff was courteous.  The majority of the food was good.  I had a great Strawberry shrimp salad.   Unfortunately my friend next to me had to send both vegetables back to be reheated. When we ask to split the check the waiter added some items that belong to others onto another friends check. Mistakes happen. Atmosphere was great. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I couldn't even tell that it was a steakhouse or a chain. It felt more comfortable and much swankier than your regular Outback. The lights are low, the kitchen is open and the patrons tend to be a bit more on the sophisticated side. No screaming kids and no birthday group chant-and-claps. 

We did wait - even though it was a Wednesday - but not for terribly long. They also have Happy Hour Wednesdays which means their delicious pineapple martinis are only $4. Well drinks and beer(?) are only $5. Snap! 

We started out with the lobster queso which was quite tasty. They serve it with tortilla chips though the bread is also a tasty accompaniment. (This is random, but the bread they serve looks like a butt. Like a human butt. It's weird.) My friend and I both had the salads. They were fabulous. My server was more than wiling to put up with my custom order. (Add this, take this off.) Be careful, though - they automatically mix in the dressing instead of serving it on the side. It got a bit drippy towards the end and I couldn't take my leftovers home. 

We also indulged ourselves with the Lemon Big Daddy cake. They have a chocolate version too, but since we're in the south we went with the lemon. It's a delicious, light cake served with fresh blueberries and whip cream. I'm pretty sure a choir of angels started singing the moment it hit my taste buds. I was all, Michael? Is that you? You want a bite?

Although Firebirds gave me food coma, I would say it's top notch as far as chains go. I must now find some fat pants to wear as I lay on the couch."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my family during an over night stay in Tempe. We were looking for a good steakhouse and decided to try them out. I ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon and my husband ordered the ribeye. The steaks were really good and seasoned well. Our only complaint was that both of our steaks were a little undercooked. Other than that, everything was really good including service. Everyone in our party really enjoyed their dinner. We will definitely stop by this place again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"We chose this spot to have our first anniversary dinner, probably not really thinking about the crowds that would be at the mall for the the day after Christmas Shopping...other than having a little more wait time than we were expecting on a Wednesday night, this visit was very good.

I think our waitress' name was Ashley...I've got to start writing it down when we have great service!  We had the Ranch Rings for an appetizer and they were good enough, but definitely not my favorite by far, and the sauce was not complimentary to the rings in my humble opinion.  I chose the chicken pasta for my entree and it was delicious and more than plenty to enjoy that night, plus lunch leftovers later!  The sauce was rich, but not overly so and the hint of bacon was a nice touch.  My husband had the Aspen Sirloin and said it was your basic steak, probably nothing overwhelmingly \"wow\" about it, but still tasty and it was cooked perfectly to his liking.

Because we had dessert at home, we opted for none this trip, though we did see several coming out that looked yummy.  All in all it was a great visit, mainly due to the great service we had, never an empty glass, attentive group effort to make sure everything was okay and two decent menu options.  We'll probably be back in the near future...it seems to be on the somewhat regular rotation in our circle of friends right now!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here more often since I've gone paleo. The space is classic-almost has a Colorado lodge feel to it. The cocktails are excellent. I recommend their signature old fashioned.

Last time I was here was to celebrate my brother's and my birthday-the staff even signed a little happy birthday note card for each of us.

When I asked if the wings were breaded, the waitress said she'd check and also bring me a gluten free menu which was astute of her. I do wish that they'd consider a separate fryer for non-breaded items so they could put more items on their gluten free menu, but overall it was fine. I ended up with a tenderloin and a baked potato. 

I tried my nieces shrimp entree and it was pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 5 people on Wednesday after work (around 5) because they have $5 drink specials and $5 bar bites. The drink specials you can get all day, and throughout the restaurant, but the bar bites are only available from 4-6:30 in the bar. Because food can be pricey, I was glad we found a table in the bar area to squeeze in to. 

We ended up ordering chicken tacos, loaded tater tots, pigs in a blanket, and pretzels and beer cheese. 

There is a spicy sour cream on the tacos so beware. The tater tots were by far my favorite food, so if you have to pick one go with these. They were hot and crunchy and loaded with toppings including green chili. The pigs in a blanket were ok. Definitely made in-house but kind of lacking for me. The pretzels and beer cheese were good, but a little bland. 

The drink specials include all of the martinis and mixed drinks on the bar menu. A lot to choose from and I definitely made sure I got my moneys worth. My favorite was the blood orange drink. I can't remember exactly what was in it, but it wasn't too sweet and it had blood orange liqueur which was awesome and different. 

I think we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour drinks and appetizers. Signature drink Double Black Diamond was a good choice. Service was as expected and friendly. Manager checked-in between drinks and food - nice to see management on the floor.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This used to be a place where we would dine regularly. Last evening we decided, on short notice, that we had not been here in a couple of months and  really wanted to go. Upon arrival we noticed that there were a few people waiting for a table, not unusual. We put our name in, told 45 min wait, and proceeded to bar. Discussing this it seemed a might bit long of a wait time considering this is a Tuesday night and really just a normal busy so they must of given us the \" worst case\" and would impress with faster seating. 
Needless to say this must have been best scenario as 1 hour later we were still waiting for a table. I went up to ask and was told \" 15 to 17\" minutes more. The hostess table and employees there were very unprofessional and incompetent as well. By the time we were seated my appetite was tepid as waiting that long will do that to you. Our table was sticky and needed to be wiped down or \" sanitized for a second time\". I ordered  the ribeye as a medium rare, it showed charcoal crisp on the sides, not a little due to cooking at high temp but seriously over done.

This review would be lower than the 2 stars except for the fact of a great bar staff that evening that showed both concern for our plight and professionalism. If i am going out again to drink I would consider this place. If I am looking for good service and food, I will go to The Keg!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Continues to be one of the best places for high quality food and drinks. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Ok....It's official I'm addicted to Firebirds!!!! And yes, they deserve all 5 stars!!!

The food and drinks are consistently good and I have yet to find something I didn't absolutely LOVE!

Tonight, my friends and I went out for dinner and drinks and we had a wonderful time!  I tried the Passion Punch and it was AMAZING...It's definitely a sweet and sour blend of SKYY Infusions ,All Natural Passion Fruit Vodka, St. Germain
 liqueur, fresh squeezed lime and fresh strawberry pieces. Would I like another?! Yes please! You will not regret it! It's very refreshing and delicious!

For Starters we tried the Lobster Spinach Queso-A spicy blend of lobster, baby spinach, tomatoes and pepper jack cheese with tri-colored tortilla chips. YUM!!! Nice large pieces of lobster mixed with spinach and the pepper jack cheese make this a great starter! It's wonderful! 

For my meal, I had the sesame encrusted salmon which comes with ginger mustard aioli, Parmesan mashed potatoes, fried spinach. OK....where do I begin??? The aioli is too delicious for words....its so full of flavor and with the sesame crust on the salmon it offers such a great compliment to the fish. The Parmesan mashed are delicious as well, but that fried spinach is so unique! It literally melts in your mouth. Our waitress called them spinach chips....and that is so true! 

All in all, this has become one of my new favorite places and I look forward to coming back again....VERY soon!"}
{"text":"I personally would rate this restaurant 10 stars if they were available.  The food was amazing, the service was top rate.  Katherine was truely one of the best servers I have ever encountered.  A gentleman whom I am guessing to be the Manager came over to the table to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and I watched him as he constantly observed what was going on in the dining room.  Additionally the prices are excellent for the quality and over the top customer service!"}
{"text":"Lackluster food, but still a nice atmosphere for a date. The fried spinach,  which is normally as crispy as a thin potato chip, was moist and floppy. The sesame encrusted  salmon was lacking flavor and the mashed potatoes were dry and bland."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 arrived on a busy Saturday night with a dinner wait time of 40 minutes.  So off to the bar we go and immediately savor a couple of delicious perfectly made Manhattans and a relatively obscure old drink version-Rob Roy....a great start!
Our dinner was equally terrific albeit with a male server who was slow and inattentive to our table.  Thus the reason for only 4 stars...Our 4 different entrees were all delicious and hot---Swordfish, petite filet, coconut shrimp and Kobe meat loaf---can't go wrong with any of these choices!
This is basically our \"go to\" place after we attend a movie at Arrowhead Harkins and we have never been disappointed with the food.  Consistency is what you get here---just maybe you may need to rope in your server occasionally and let him or her know you are a paying customer requiring great service."}
{"text":"This is a great place. I've lived in Peoria for years and for some reason never made it to this joint. 

So a few weeks ago I'm on  date and figure I will give this place a try. I was BLOWN AWAY. Can't help but to be another person to say it's \"cozy\" environment was relaxing, but i just did, it is! The only thing missing was a fireplace.
The food, I had a bacon wrapped filet, MED RARE, i enjoy blood. WOW it was great. had a HUGE baked potato, some good IPA beer and my date had some wine. 

All in all, great place for a great night out for dinner, would come back!"}
{"text":"I would love to give you a better rating, because I liked the waiter. Not for his service, but because of his personality. First of all. If you are going to place hostesses in the front to greet patrons, please make sure they are efficient. My family and I visited Firebirds Northlake because of Father's day. We made reservations to ensure we would get a table since it was Father's day. There were approx. 3 very young ladies seating the patrons. One hostess proceeded to seat us but we told her we wanted a booth, so we returned to the front of the restaurant while that hostess went to ensure a booth was being prepared for us. About 2 minutes later, a second hostess proceeds to take us to a table and we told THAT hostess we asked for a booth! Please communicate between all of you!!

Next, I am dieting and I track everything I eat. I went on Firebirds website and found their nutritional page. I made my selections beforehand, as to what I would be ordering. On their website was an entrée called Citrus Grilled Chicken; perfect! I pre-tracked this entrée. When we got to our booth to order our food, I looked at the menu and Citrus Grilled Chicken was nowhere on the menu. I asked our waiter if they still offered this chicken dish and he said no. I told him it was on THIER website. He spoke with the manager and was told it is NOW being called Pineapple Chicken. Okay, no worries, but why is the information not updated on YOUR website.

The manager came to our table and told me a lot of times when they change their menus in the restaurant, they are not immediately updated on their websites!! WHY!! It should be.

The Pineapple chicken dish was  . . . . okay. Nothing spectacular!!

My husband ordered their French Dip Sliders and couldn't eat all of them, so he took some of his meal home. He asked the server for a to-go box and a cup to put the au jus in. The first cup he brought him had a bug in it!!!!! REALLY!!

Finally, the prices are WAY TO HIGH for the quality of food and the service!!!!! This is our last time at Firebirds! No wonder there were empty seats.

One more thing!! Waiter service was bad. Our server was forgetful. I could see if it was terribly busy, but it was not!!"}
{"text":"Excellent New Year's dinner! We made reservations and we were promptly seated. Great booth seating and warm, cozy atmosphere. We started with a spinach/lobster cheese dip with tortilla chips. Excellent appetizer to begin the meal. Drinks were always filled and service was fantastic. All around great meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Chain upscale eatery with all the comfort foods very well presented in a cabin like atmosphere with excellent service and extensive food and drink menu.  Beautiful environment."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place only has 4 stars! The bread and butter are a great start to a steak that was out of this world. Mike M was very attentive but not intrusive, made his presence known but walking past multiple times. We asked so many questions and asked his honest opinion and he gave us the honest answers, not just the customer service answer."}
{"text":"Service - The servers seemed very overwhelmed with a half filled restaurant. They forgot or ketchup, mayo and water at different times during the meal. 

Food - I ordered the French dip and felt it was dry and under flavored. The price was far too high for the quality of product. The rest of my party enjoyed their salads and burgers. 

Price - I felt as though the price points were too high for the food presented."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Got the surf'n'turf,  steak was cooked right, lobster tail was perfect.  Staff was great too.  Had a 45 minute wait, but they will text you when your table is ready, so we went and did some shopping nearby.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Late afternoon lunch to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Must say my focus was more on the company than the food but here's what I can tell you:

Friends ordered the Lobster Spinach Queso for an appetizer.  I had a little and it was tasty but not spectacular.  Nice big chunks of lobster which was a nice surprise.  

I had the Pecan Crusted Trout.  The fish itself was so-so, not much seasoning and the portion was small.  It comes with a peach/cilantro salsa on top that I didn't care for and scraped off.  The star on the plate was the side of tortilla slaw.  Red cabbage, carrots, tortilla strips in a vinegary dressing.  I ate all of that and could have eaten more.

Their bread...to die for.  I could have been happy sitting there eating just that with butter and they could have charged as much as my entree and still I'd be happy. 

The birthday girl had the Aspen Sirloin and said it was just okay.  My other friend ordered the French Dip Sandwich but she was so into her side dishes that she filled up too fast and didn't even try it.  I'll let you know if she says it was good as leftovers.  The side that she said was great was the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes.  

The birthday girl loved her free dessert, the Big Daddy Chocolate Cake.  I love a low-key birthday dessert presentation and Firebirds did it well, just a candle and a happy birthday wish, no songs.  The portion of gooey chocolate cake was huge, with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce on the side.  Very yum.

Service was great, drinks were refilled frequently.  The staff was patient with us, not asking us to clear out as we sat chatting even though the dinner crowd was descending.  

One note about the parking...it was fine when we got there around 3:45 but it was a death match as we were leaving.  People trolling around, cutting each other off, zooming into spaces.  Craziness!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to go have a steak they cook it exactly how u want it, juicy, and has flavor to it. I loved the food and so did my girlfriend, it was truly one of the best experience we had in awhile. We would recommend it to anyone and would go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the attentive staff. There was a group of 25 of us on a lunch outing for work. They kept all of drinks full and the food came out in a timely matter. They by far made a lasting impression on myself and everyone else at the lunch. Not only was the service phenomenal but the food followed suit. It was deliciously mouth watering."}
{"text":"I toyed with the idea of 3 stars here, because the service was attentive, the cocktails were good, and the food was at least passable.  But not much more than that.  What got me a bit perturbed was that the whole attitude here reeks of some giant corporate machine (and how are we doing today, sir?  and how are we enjoying our meal sir?)  Everything was very expensive, too, and that knocks them down another notch.

A group of 6 of us arrived during happy hour, and had a wait of 20 minutes.  Not bad, and they were true to their word.  We bellied up to the bar and were informed that drinks were $5 (or was it $7) but only well drinks were that price.  Four martinis cost over $40.  Now I'm prepared to pay that in a big city, but this is suburban Chandler.  And it was happy hour!  Who drinks a vodka martini in a supposedly nice restaurant with well vodka?  Arrghhh, I am ranting now.

I had a salad and a steak.  The steak was a little overdone but tasty.  But then again, you can't screw up a ribeye too badly.  Nor a salad.  I can't even remember my side, I think it was mashed potatoes, and they tasted like, well, plain mashed potatoes.

Great decor, but I won't be back to see it again."}
{"text":"Cold meal but manager took it off the bill. Very good steak. Manager walked us out after they found out I'm a high level Google and yelp reviewer.  Interesting treatment after that."}
{"text":"My original review was is listed in the next paragraph, but i wanted to update this to reflect the generiousity of corporate Firebirds.  Less than 24 hours after writting my review I was contacted by someone in Firebirds that both called and emailed me to express their apologies for the service I experienced.  This was very nice and unexpected.  They offered to credit my transaction, though I declined because I did eat and it was not fair.  However, they said they would like to send me some gift cards for my troubles.  I thanked them expecting not to see anything.  A few days later I received $50 gift card to give them a try again and another $50 gift card for another restaurant in the area.  Though my service was very bad the first time I visted this place they're corporate staff went over and above to resolve the issue and redeem themselves for the incident.  Because they were so nice and responsive I will be making a point to go back and give them a fair and honest second review not taking into consideration my first experience.  Review to follow in coming weeks.

I waited 45 minutes for 2 appetizers because they were out of the prime rib.  I was by myself.  The food was just fine, worth the price and slightly better than I expected.  None the less I was ignored and they brought my food extremely late.  Managers even noticed and asked me if I needed anything, but didn't offer anything, which is not typical (free app or drink, or something).  I paid full price and did not tip, only the second time in my life.  Worst service ever!  I gave them 2 stars only because their food was good and they were not worth 1."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place out for the first time about four months ago 
We weren't happy at all .. 
Management contacted me soon after and apologized for our experience and gave us a 50 gift card to return 
I held on to the cards until Mothers Day 
I ordered three cheeseburgers and a large salad with steak and blue cheese to go 
My husband told me the restaurant covered the full bill that went over the 50 gift card amount just a little .. very sweet 
My salad was super delicious!! 
Oh my gosh , I could of eaten two of them !! 
The burgers were a bit dried out and hard however I did order them medium 
Overall 
Great comeback 
We will be returning :)"}
{"text":"For some reason, I was surprised by this place. I didn't have high expectations. The food and service were very good. We'll be back, although it's pretty far from home, so we won't become regulars."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. The delicious sounding menu, the ambiance and especially the customer service. 

Stopped in when it was busy. There was a wait for a table but hubs and I were able to score a couple of seats at the bar. Upon being seated we ordered a couple of brews and started debating what we were going to order. 

I love that the menu is not overly complicated- there are plenty of selections but not enough to make your head spin like some other places. Even though there wasn't an overwhelming amount of choices everything sounded so good that it made making a decision difficult. 

Ended up ordering a burger and after what seemed like just a few short minutes (love when you have good company to make time fly!) the food arrived. The burger I ordered was supposed to come with bacon but it was missing. I didn't really mind this so I didn't say much. I then asked to see the menu b/c in my debating on what to order I thought I remembered seeing the burger with bacon option cost more than what I had received. 

I expressed my price question to the bartender as I was looking at the menu and realized that I had mixed things up in my head and there was, in fact, no price difference. She was quick to verify there was no price difference but also quick to offer to go and get me bacon from the back to eat with the remainder of my burger, which I declined. 

I was ready to move on with it and was feeling a little embarrassed that I asked about the price b/c I had mixed things up when the manager showed up, apologized for the missing bacon and offered to buy us desert. 

We finished our meals and were too stuffed to think about desert. The bartender then insisted we should take it to go and I have to tell you, I had the most delicious breakfast of  chocolate cake the following day that my mouth still waters thinking about it. 

The way that we were treated after what was basically my mistake for reading the menu wrong and a little missing bacon has made me a real fan of this place. It is refreshing to see places take pride in what they are serving and caring how the customer is treated when so many places seem to not care anymore and this will make me a repeat customer for a long time to come."}
{"text":"We love this place.   Their filets are cooked to perfection--- that's my perfection which is hard to find.  Excellent quality of meat --no fat or grizzle.   BLT salad a must to start and the loaded baked potato yum
Wait staff have been trained well and you will never want one thing or be unhappy. We have eaten in Tennessee, Tucson & Peoria and had top notch everything all three experiences"}
{"text":"We called for a reservation the day before we intended to go, but when we arrived they could not find our reservation.  When they finally found the reservation they told us it would be a little while. We had arrived on time. A couple walked in the door and were immediately seated. When we asked why, the hostess looked distressed and had us taken to a table. The table seated 6. One side was a bench with 3 chairs on the other side. It was right next to an exit that went out to a patio and while we stood there 2 different people came in that exit. We looked at the table and told the hostess \"No\" and immediately left. It was a horrible first impression. We will never go back. Perhaps we should have asked to see a manager but our evening was ruined by that point.  Avoid this place at all costs. Horrible."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was fairly well, (except peppercorn steak was WAY overloaded with peppercorn, we're talkin' 1/2\" thick  of spice around the entire piece of meat. If you're into that kind of thing, I didn't like biting into 90% spice ande 10% meat. But it gets better as you work into it..

The second time we went left me saying, \"What happened?..\"
When we first came in, they said the wait was going to be 5-10 min., we waited 20 min. I just figured the food was so good that people had to be forced to leave. Wrong. When we sat, the waiter got us waters and took our orders (Lobster bisque dip for appetizer, Medium Well Prime rib 16 oz. with baked potato and salmon salad-with no tomatos for entrees),  but didn't give us any bread at all (which we saw on every single table). 

I swear we sat there for 25 min. sipping water before we got anything. I was getting more and more annoyed as we watched everybody around us receive food. Apparently, some other waiter had stolen our waiter's Lobster appetizer. Why didn't our waiter just tell us that instead of the runner girl? The runner apologized, and I was like okay...but then she left and we only had one appetizer plate to share this thing. Urg. Lobster dip did not have enough lobster bits in in, more queso than anything.

As the entrees arrived, they looked great. As I chewed off some meat, it was getting more rare and I dug deeper, more bloody and the taste just overwhelmed me. I couldn't continue. I don't like being the ass that asks for a 'redo', but there was no way I was going to eat this obviously Medium-Medium Rare steak. Hubs got tons of tomato in his salad which he requested not to have. I sent my steak back and the hubs complained about the tomatos and salmon that was a bit rare. 

The manager was nice enough to give us $20 in gift cards to apologize for the mishaps we've had throughout the night, I just wish the waiter would have done more to make sure we were happy."}
{"text":"We had our Easter dinner here.  I had the ribeye, one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.  Everybody in our group had a wonderful meal. All their steaks were cooked exactly as ordered.  Our server was Alyssa, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was overall pretty decent.  It is a mid-level steakhouse with typical American fare.  The bar area was very bright (to many bright lights in my opinion) and busy.  

The BLT salad was terrible.  It was like that Costco mixed green salad that the cafeteria served in elementary school.  The salad showed up before the server even sat down my silverware and was completely drenched in salad dressing.  Tip: Ask for all dressing and sauces on the side.  The only thing worse that the salad was the service... One bartender was slinging drinks like a champ, the guy working with her completely left her hanging! Nevertheless, the meal continued :/ 

The worst thing in the world that could ever happen happened ... (Dramatic Pause) I actually had to send food back to the kitchen (glug, knife through my heart) I absolutely pride myself on not sending good back to anyone's kitchen but my medium rare steak came out with hoofs on still breathing, so rare.  The server didn't even attempt to argue, and rushed the plate back to the kitchen.

The refired steak was slightly better than the first but still not really delicious. I want to like this place ... I feel like it has potential.... So one star for the lady bartender and one for hope."}
{"text":"Ate here once thanks to a recruiter, the interior is very swanky.  Even though it was during lunch time, the place was packed and dimly light inside, creating that atmosphere... though I don't think that's needed for that time of day.  Anyway, I ordered the Aspen Sirloin with seasoned steak fries (wasn't paying for it).  After an acceptable wait of 15 minutes, the order was on the table.  The steak was perfect: medium-rare that cut like butter with the knife.  The whole steak was consumed, as were the steak fries.  It was a fantastic steak.  Would go again if I can rope someone else into paying for it. ^_^"}
{"text":"This is the best place for a great kids meal! Salmon,steak,ribs and 2 sides with it for around $7.95!  My kids loved the variety. My daughter had the ribs, fresh fruit and carrot sticks and dip. My son had the salmon, cooked veggies and mashed potatoes. If you are traveling and want to bring the kids to a nicer place I would recommend Firebirds.
Great  steaks, great wine list and half price wine in Tuesday,s  The desserts are HUGE so only order 1 for 3 people. And the carrot cake was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! 


Tried the coconut shrimp as an appetizer, there were only 5 for two people and a giant pile of slaw which wasn't very good alone.

The blue cheese filet is superb. If you haven't had the BLT salad, I highly recommend that as well. 

Our waiter was very confident and knowledgable, it was very refreshing."}
{"text":"I really like Firebirds, food is always good, I ate at the bar on Friday night, place was packed, I started with the BLT salad, it was great, salad was cold, plate was cold, bacon was really close to being overcooked as it looked really dark but it was good nonetheless, entree I ordered Prime Rib mr, it came out perfectly cooked it was just barely warm but very flavorful and tender, I have to say that it is really hard to serve a \"hot\" medium rare prime rib. The loaded baked potato was great!! I love their baked potatoes, they always taste like they just came out of the oven! Service at the bar was excellent, the only compliant I have is that i ordered a Creme Brûlée cheesecake to go and it took a long long time to come out, the bartender even apologized twice because it took so long...the cheesecake is one the best I have ever tasted though!! Highly recommend Firebirds"}
{"text":"The food is terrible our food came out tasting like fish I drove from Scottsdale to try the food I ended up eating down the street because the taste of the food was unbearable."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here too many times. Service is excellent, food is amazing and prices are fair for the area and food. Do yourself a favor and make a trip there."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and was trying to find a nice restaurant to eat at. I found this place on Yelp and wanted to try it out. The wait was a little long but it was completely worth it. I got the filet mingon and it was absolutely outstanding. Everyone I was with also really enjoyed their meals. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Dropped a friend off at band practice so decided to try this place that I've heard about first impression was very noisy inside but not over-the-top noisy surprisingly the bar was quieter than the main dining room and the atmosphere in the bar with quiet and relaxing I have a big fireplace and a very well-stocked bar and the menu that I will definitely have to come back and check out some more food I have the turkey club and fries and my wife had the portobello mushroom sandwich both very tasty definitely will have to come back again"}
{"text":"The best moderately priced steak in the SouthPark area! Everything I've ever ordered has been great. Friendly staff and nice relaxed atmosphere, without excessive noise. One of my favorites, especially the filet mignon and the ribs.
If you're not a meat or fish eater, not many vegetarian options (my wife doesn't eat meat)! She loves the salads though!"}
{"text":"Wow, haven't been in for a year. bartenders didn't acknowledge us for 5 minutes, unacceptable , wings were awful...who is running this place now?"}
{"text":"I'm working in Phoenix this week with another company guy, so we both looked on Yelp! and settled on Firebirds - a well rated restaurant in the Chandler Fashion District, close to the office we are working at.  On entering (early evening), we were greeted with a lovely smoky smell that tantalized.  Seating was immediate by a friendly hostess.

The restaurant has a relatively dark interior similar to many other steak houses.  I could hear the music, but it sounded like it was coming from another room.  They could have piped it in to the main room quietly so that it didn't have the distant echoy effect.

My dining companion ordered a strawberry lemonade that was served in a pint glass with a sugared rim.  There were slices of fruit inside and froth on top - evidence of its fresh taste.  I, as usual, ordered coffee and that was much more bitter than I like.  Dark roasts that have been left to heat too long always taste the same, and it isn't good.

Since so many people liked the crab cakes, we ordered those for an appetizer.  To my mind, they had too much of a strong celery taste.  The spicy marmalade sauce that they came with complemented the crab cakes excellently.  The slaw had crispy tortilla strips in it and a nice light dressing - very tasty.

Our ceasar salads arrived.  The usual romaine lettuce was well dressed and augmented by in-house made croutons (the bread also being baked in-house) and nice slices of parmesan cheese.  Unfortunately, the parmesan was the only salt component, so the salad was fairly flat.

I ordered the Durango burger - a chile spiced affair with pepper jack cheese, fried onions and roasted garlic ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, despite the tantalizing smell when we entered the restaurant, there was no smokiness on the burger.  Nor was there any spice.  They grind the meat in-house, so the medium rare burger had a good texture ans taste to it.  However I wanted punch, and got none.

My dining companion ordered the smoke house burger with bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon and grated cheddar cheese.  There was too much bbq sauce included, and the cheddar cheese was not melted.  The bacon was the highlight here.  He also had fries (whereas I opted to replace the fries with my salad).  The portion size on the fries could only be described as small, and the fries were left behind as unappetizing.

Overall, an average place.  It's certainly a place I will go to again, but I'm likely to try other offerings in the area before I choose to go back."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! Love the atmosphere. Ask for Keegan, a great server and very attentive to our needs. No wait time, everything was prepared as we ordered it. Manager came over and was extremely friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great experience with wonderful staff and great ambiance. Lobster tail was delicious as well as the salmon. Martini's were also tasty."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was mediocre at best. Came in to eat rather later (9pm) for dinner after a hockey game. We had a group of 5 and saw some empty table walking through the restaurant to get to the hostess stand. They told us it was a 5-10 min wait. Probably waited about 15-20. Not sure why it took so long. 

Once we sat down they had one server come over to get our drink order but we just sat down so didn't even have time to look at the drink menu. Came back a while later and gave our order. Then we had a different person come to take a food order. We didn't know what we wanted at that time so we asked for them to come back. It took a while for them to come back to take our order. He wasn't the most friendly waiter nor did he check on us after placing our order. There wasn't many people in the restaurant that he was busy. It seemed like he was annoyed we had come in to get food. 

The bar set up looked really cool but didn't have a huge selection of local craft beer on tap which was a disappointment for me. They had more of a selection in bottles and cans."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing! Excellent, fresh food, amazing staff and I've never had much of a wait. I've tried several different dishes and never been disappointed. We make a point of going whenever we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"New to the area and looking for a nice dinner.  Too many chain restaurants!  Firebirds was recommended for steak but I wasn't in the mood for steak-I wanted fish. I settled on the trout and hoped it would be fresh. It was very good!  Fresh, nicely prepared with a pecan crust that did not over power the flavor of the fish, served over a crunchy slaw and a hint of pineapple salsa. Delicious! I will return. Service was good...forgot the bread.  Entrees arrived just as we were finishing our salads.  Not time to linger."}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant, good service, but the quality of food is terrible. We have gone a few times (gluttons for punishment I guess) and every time the steak is burnt, tough, and small. There are much better steakhouse options in the area! Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Great every time we go there. From food to drinks to service, apps, deserts etc..will continue to visit."}
{"text":"You seat me four feet away from a large table, in a booth on the other side of a kicking kid, close enough to the kitchen I can hear your high-pitched alarm continuously go off, and then have the NERVE to  charge me $30 for ANYTHING?  My entire meal, which sat there while husband's fish was cooked, was luke warm and he had to wait while it was refired.  The only reason I gave you a second star was because you comped my meal.  The food is OK, but not good enough to wait 30 minutes for.  The kitchen is much too small to serve the large dining room.  And the whine when their alarm goes off is intolerable.  Go somewhere else unless you sit outside and only order drinks.  Oh, and the service was not as good as Village Inn."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a meal. My husband and I drove in from so cal and stopped here for a much needed rest and lunch. We sat at the bar so we could watch a little golf and Matt was our bartender/server.  He is personable, polite and engaging.  The food was awesome.  The mahi tacos were delicious as were the mushrooms sautéed in port   The tortilla soup was selfish as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Firebirds is technically a chain and I usually avoid chains like the plague. However this Firebirds is the exception that makes the rule. I have been going here for at least ten years and have always been treated very well.
The Durango burger has got to be one of the top 3 in Arizona. The Ivan (The Attic) still reigns supreme. The cilantro chicken breast is one of my wife's favorites. We both agree that the BLT salad is fantastic. The prices provide a great value. The kitchen really shines and executes at a high level everyday. Anyone can design a great dish, but executing it regularly is the hard part. I steer away from the steaks because they have to cut them thin to cook them on the wood-fired grill. They are fine, but I prefer a tall filet or a thicker ribeye. Otherwise Firebirds is solid eats."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for someone's birthday and the service was WONDERFUL I will say that, however the restaurant was dimly lit so if you're ok with not seeing your food while you eat it may work for you. The atmosphere was nice but I was also having a good time with friends so ?. 

I ordered the steak medium well & it came well past well done, other than that nothing about my meal was memorable (good or bad).

I went to the Northlake location & they offered valet parking which was convenient since it was PACKED & walking from a long distance parking spot..in the cold..with high heels would of been no fun! 

Try it for yourself, it could of just been an off day!"}
{"text":"I think Firebirds delivers on the atmosphere and misses on the food.  I have been there a few times and I have never found a single menu item that I would place in any column other than 'ok'.  

I would never reccommend"}
{"text":"We went again Friday for dinner, and it was a complete different expirement.
The service was bad they forget to bring one of the side and we had to ask for it twice before they bring it, the burger was burned(one side was completely black), the desert was the only good thing in this visit."}
{"text":"After posting this review giving one star, Firebirds contacted me and immediately addressed the bad service they were providing take out customers and fixed the process to make take out customers a priority. Since that time I have had 5 great take out experiences. I am updating my original review to reflect the attention to improving the customer experience they provide. I recommend Firebirds for their great food, good attention to improving the customer experience, and excellent service. 

If you want to do take out of this good food, don't bother. They have the crappie at service and process for take out. First, when you call the hostess will put you on hold for the bar. You can expect to wait 5 to 10 minutes before a bartender will be willing to pick up the phone. When you go to pick up the food, again you have to go to the bar and for the bartender you are last to be waited on, your food will sit there getting cold while the bartender pours drinks, walks the bar, waits on other customers. I have had this same experience 3 times in a row at different times and days of the week. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my sister after a Sunday afternoon movie... perfectly located right across the street from the theater.

The outside of the building made it look like this was a really nice place to go to enjoy a meal... and what happened on the inside did not disappoint.   

We were greeted in a very pleasant manner by the hostess.   She welcomed us with a big smile and asked us if we preferred a booth or table, which I personally love having the option.    She answered my sister's questions about the delicious looking Pineapple filled decanter on the bar, which apparently is their Pineapple Martini, which I would have loved to try... maybe next time... 

My sister and I sat in the dining room and the décor was lovely.   It was like being in an upscale hunting lodge.  The only thing I didn't like was the big dead head above the fireplace.  I get it - hunters hunt and I eat meat, and it's all about population control- ok, ok, but that's for a different website, I still don't like to see heads unless they are perched upon a majestic animal.   I'm entitled to my opinion. 

She and I shared the ahi tuna appetizer, which was very nicely done and presented.  It was served with a nice side of greens, which was delicious.  Especially loved the hot mustard sauce it was served with.

I enjoyed the Colorado Chicken salad which had amazing greens, tender juicy chicken, bleu cheese, apples, cranberries, and walnuts.  It was super super good and the dressing was perfect. 

My sister had the Crab Cake salad and she loved hers, too.   She had been to Firebirds a time or two before this and really loved the experiences she had had before.  

I'm really glad we stopped in and in the land of restaurants in the Arrowhead area, I really hope this one stays for a long time, I'd really love to try their other dishes!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Firebirds and it's always enjoyable, but Matt has made it a whole new experience. He does wonders for your management team, he goes well above and beyond to take care of my wife's allergy and is extremely genuine. Thank you - and we will be back more frequently."}
{"text":"Firebirds is the most delicious restaurant I have ever eaten at! The chicken, seafood, steak, salads, soups, bread is fabulous! They have an organic wine that is to die for! Brandon is the best server there! Margaritas are great too!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I discovered this place!  I haven't had a steak this good since Steaksmith in Santa Fe!  (Rip). 

Filet mignon melted in my mouth!  The bacon just the right bonus flavor!  I upgraded with shrimp skewer and it was fantastic!!  Loaded baked potato and stick a fork in me!  I was DONE!!

We also had the steak salad which I'm told was outstanding!!  

I can't wait to go back!

The service was really attentive without being annoying and the noise level was not at all bad. in fact, a table of 10 was seated next to us and at first I was aggravated by that. Especially since they were a table of young people (early to mid 20s). And I'm happy to say, they were perfect dining neighbors!  

Oh. And the prices!  I expected our bill to be over $100.00. (Steaksmith, easy...  Without drinks!!). We were out the door for less than 80."}
{"text":"Holy Kobe Beef Meatloaf! This was a perfect meal for my sister and I to have a celebration dinner. Kobe Beef Meatloaf people! Amazing :) Crab Queso to start with. A glass of Malbec, and mac and cheese for my son. The staff was so attentive and extremely friendly. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time eating here after driving by it many times since it opened and have to say I was impressed.
We had the Coconut Shrimp appetizer, filet kabobs with grilled veggies and Au Gratin potatoes and prime rib with loaded baked potato. 
Service was also good so we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about going here the first time because I thought they may not cater to those who don't eat red meat... but they have a good selection of fish & chicken options. 

I have now been here a couple of times and have tried the Pecean Encrusted Trout and the Sesame Encrusted Salmon.  Both are fabulous. If you are a fan of starchy sides, definitely try their parmesan mashed potatoes - yummy comfort food!  

Dinner entrees range between $16 - 28... so if you are planning to have an adult beverage (or 2), appetizers, and an entree, you can easily drop $40 - $50 a person (before the tip).  

However, if you are on a budget, this is also a great spot for lunch or to meet friends for appetizers and beverages. 

They have a nice little patio too when weather permits."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for almost a couple of years now and it never fails to deliver.  The staff is always great and a manager almost always comes around to make sure we are satisfied.  I've tried quite a bit of their menu however I generally go back to the burgers which I think are so tasty.  

I go for the Durango burger since they took their amazing Pablano burger off the menu (complain about that if you go!  bring it back Firebird's).  The potato skins go great as an appetizer.

My other go to is a BLT salad with grilled chicken (get the raspberry chipotle dressing with this and win at life).

Only once did my food come out sub par.  I ordered a rib-eye and it ended up being very tough and unsatisfying.  A manager took care of me with a new steak and a fresh baked potato.  Problem solved!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious salad and wonderful fresh lemonade.  Definitely come here again when I'm on the west side."}
{"text":"We just ate there tonight for the first time and absolutely loved it.  The service was great (we DID eat dinner at 4:30, though, so it wasn't extremely busy), the food was great and we loved the atmosphere.  I had the California Chicken salad and it was VERY good.  My husband had one of the burgers and TATER TOTS.  OMG, the tater tots were awesome.  We would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"So my wife daughter and son went to Firebirds with moderate expectations. It was about 2pm when we arrived. The hostess was on the phone and with a smile puts one finger in the air and puts her head back down. A manager comes behind her (she makes sure not to make eye contact with any of us) then turns around. Three other serves (who had nothing in their hands) walked right passed us. I said to myself \"Hmmm... I hope the food isn't as bad as the hospitality.\" After standing and staring at the hostess for about six more minutes...we were seated.
Our server...forget her name...was genuine in her service. That's about all I can say. She forgot our Caesar salad (which is pretty bland) but the croûtons are ok. I ordered the Aspen Sirloin mid-rare. Texture reminded me of those stretchy hands n feet you used to get out of those little quarter machines back in the day and it tasted nothing like beef...straight salt. So I reordered the Filet Mignon. Now...I understand that it was on the fly...but there's no reason the center of the filet should be under 75degrees. NONE. The center was cold...I mean COLD.  By this point I'm starved and just ask for two minutes on each side. So the manager (yes the same from earlier) drops off my plate and it's clearly obvious she hates her job and shouldn't be there...especially in a management capacity. So after getting my medium steak back...it was wrapped with a nasty, slimy attempt at bacon. I'd give the steak itself (everything else aside) a 4.5.
I ask for a glass of malbec and the waitress looks at me with this perplexed look and goes...\"Ummm...what's that?\". LMFAO!!! I'm sorry you're in steakhouse and the waiter doesn't know a red wine when she hears it???? 
So after its all said and done my bill is presented. No GC, no taking care of my daughters plate, glass of wine...nothing. I'm NOT a moocher! By Any means. But being in the industry...I KNOW I WOULD NEVER EVER place an untouched bill in front of my guests who had the experience I had. Even if offered, I would have probably turned it down...but it's the principle. Show that you value your guests...they don't.
Pitiful management going on there. Nothing special about the place.

If you love commercial food, and don't really care about wasting your dollar...then this place is perfect for you. OH..in there defense the Salmon my wife ordered was pretty darn good and the sauce was well made. Hence the 2nd star. Had it not been for that, and like I said our genuine server (whom I left $20 on an $84 lunch)...I would take away a couple stars. NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Well, I hadn't been to Firebirds in a few years and never had visited the location in Stonecrest before, but it was an easy and convenient choice before we saw a movie earlier this week. Really, you can park at either the theatre in Stonecrest or in front of Firebirds and everything is walkable. Really dig that about this location. 

The interior: Awesome. It's like walking into a swanky lumberjack's den. There's exposed wood, firewood, more wood....and wooden things. Dimly lit, high ceilings, lanterns....or \"man\"terns, for that matter. Just a really cool feel. I really like the split level, too. 

Our service was VERY attentive. I really can't stress how much this guy wanted to serve us. His name was Brett and he was thorough, nice, educated, and well-placed throughout the meal. 

We started with their signature cocktail -- Black Diamond Martini. I have to say it was a total letdown. Their infused citron vodka was like dull pineapple juice. It housed no kick and was just....meh. I mean, I really dig pineapple juice, but $10 pineapple juice? Think I'll pass.

I have to comment on the bread they serve pre-meal. What IS that loaf? I've never seen that shape, structure, or texture in bread before! Coated in semolina...which gets all over you and the table, by the way, and is almost cracker-like on the exterior with a slight chew in the middle. It tastes just fine, but man....what a strange recipe/method. 

I ordered the coconut shrimp for an entree. I've been on a kick of ordering things I normally wouldn't on a given night. Sigh....it was just boring. 10 semi-large shrimp, a cabbage slaw with tortilla chips, large steak fries, and an awful mango-habanero dipping sauce. The shrimp were fine au naturale, but that dipping sauce totally ruins everything. I'd rather have ketchup and that's really bad. 

I love the decor and the service. The food and sig cocktail....not so much. I'd love to come back and just sit at the bar with a beer before a movie, though! I'ma get my plaid on, kick back and enjoy that wood-laden ambiance! Cheers."}
{"text":"Our first time here...wow..awesome food..perfectly cooked!!!....we will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their special, which was tilapia, and overcooked and under seasoned. Their burger was average. The only saving grace to this visit was the service the booze and the crab cake appetizer."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this location with my boyfriend and we were both very pleased. We have been craving their Lobster queso dip appetizer ever since our first arrival so we had to make sure to order it again! It was as tasty as we first remembered it. I highly recommend it as a shareable item for the table. I also enjoy the complementary bread they provide here, it has a crunchy taste on the outside (which is how I want all my bread to be). My boyfriend got the prime rib RARE as usual and said it was good. I got the Colorado chicken salad because I was in the mood for some mixed greens. Nothing bad about the salad but nothing great either, just your average salad! Our waitress was on top of her game. She frequently checked on us and poured me a refill of my water without me needing to ask and also offer to pack up my leftovers for me. Fire bird, we will back next time, thank you for the food and great service!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I surprised my husband with a date night to your Stonecrest location. With small kids, and three home businesses, this is not a normal thing for us. We were greeted sincerely and warmly and shown immediately to a table. Our server, Casey, was sweet and genuine. She was informative and attentive, even as more people were seated in her section. My husband ordered the chile-rubbed delmonico, medium-rare. When it came, with its huge loaded baked potato side, he got a few bites in and realized it was quite rare, more than he was comfortable with. We never send food back. Ever. But it was just too rare. We asked Casey if it could be cooked for a few more minutes and she could not have been more apologetic, even though it clearly wasn't her fault. When it came back out, the manager Matt brought it to the table with another loaded potato, and asked my husband if he wouldn't mind checking the center for done-ness. My husband said it looked great, even a little bit overdone, but that it was totally fine. Matt checked the inside himself and said it was definitely now overdone for medium-rare and offered to make another. We declined, as this one was still bound to be tasty anyways. Matt insisted on compensating us with dessert, since the order had been wrong twice. We told him that wasn't necessary. However, when our bill came, he had actually removed BOTH of our desserts, something we never would have expected!! What he couldn't possibly know, is that eating at this restaurant is a financial stretch for us. I had been saving change out of my coin jar for months just to do this, and with drinks and dessert the total came to $2.00 under what I had to spend, and that was without leaving a tip. When he removed the desserts, it brought the total down enough that I was able to leave our amazing server, Casey, a much larger tip than I normally give, because I was also once a new mom serving tables. She was also just that good, and she deserved it. My total was now less than $2.00 over my budget - something I could totally live with! It made me so happy to be able to tip a great server like that. Matt and Casey are great assets to your place of business. The next time we are looking for a great place to eat, you can be sure we will be looking back there again, but only if I can be seated in her section!"}
{"text":"Went for our Anniversary. The place it very nice, a bit loud but the atmosphere is great. Service was excellent, prices are good for a place like this and the menu seemed very much what the wife and I like to eat. I got the Ribeye and my wife got the Chile Rubbed Delmonico with a lobster tail. My steak was unfortunately not a great piece of meat but was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the piece I tried to chew for 20 minutes was fantastic. I ended up eating some of my wife's steak and it was really good. Waiter did not come around for about 20 minutes so my wife was done eating by the time he came around to let him know about the problem. He was very good about the issue with my steak though and the manager came by and removed it from our bill. Not all steaks are perfect so I do not fault them for that. Would be good to check in to see how the meal is going though.... We will be back to give them another shot for sure."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere. Busy but not too noisy. Excellent service with good choices for early bird menus. Salmon best we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Hated it, over and over again. We've given this restaurant way to many chances. They over cook the food, steak AND lobster.  They served me a salad with plastic bristles in it, apparently from some brush used to make the dressing. They don't ring the orders in correctly and when dinner is served,  food is missing. And don't get me started on trying to eat in the bar... it's so distracting watching the servers gather around and fixing their hair amd touching their faces and what not.... I told them once to go wash their hands. We'll never have dinner here again."}
{"text":"Filet Mingnon is to die for with the bacon wrapped filet and smothered with Blue cheese and surrounded by marinated whole mushrooms. Next time I need to try the baby back ribs because I asked to try the BBQ sauce that they make in house and loved it. 
   Also if you want a great $10 burger this place is one of the best!! I had one the night before and it made me come back to try the Filet."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and perfect prices. We have never had a bad meal here. Strongly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a great steak at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This extremely busy restaurant was packed on a Saturday night as we were traveling north back to Mass.  My three kids all have gluten allergy (not a choice but a necessity), and so we found Firebirds on our gluten free app.   My elderly mother was floored that there was a 2 1/2 hour wait, but manager Zeke swooped in and rescued us, seating is almost immediately.   The food was fantastic!  We were so very pleased.  I had a tender tasty Delmonico w/shrimp, and an awesome Greek salad.  My son's sirloin also, cooked perfectly.  My daughter loved the salad w/strawberries.  Our waitress (Nicole, ?) was attentive, accommodating, knowledgable, and friendly.  I recommend this place to everyone , especially this particular location."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food I've ever eaten. The spinach salad was to die for and the tortilla slaw the waitress recommended was deliciously unique. My prime rib was cooked perfect and practically melted in my mouth. I assure you we will visit again next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband love this place food ok wish they had more variety on chicken but they ok Martini ok better than a lot of place I visit wish everyone was train on how to make a good lemon drop Martini"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite steak house restaurant! Great food ! Great service! Nice atmosphere! I love this place and would recommend to my friend . Had been here many times and this place just amazing !"}
{"text":"First time here. Was very busy on a Wednesday night, it was a good thing we reserved a table in advance otherwise it would have been a 30 minute wait.

The restaurant itself was big and had a modern rustic look. Bar area looked like it good be a good hangout.

Now to the food and service.
The chicken wings were awesome. I had the NY Strip steak for entree, cooked to a perfect medium. The waiters were very attentative, if not slightly too much. You would get a refill of your drink before you finished the last sip.

Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Overall for chain steak house Firebirds didn't disappoint. Firebirds operates in a weird tier above places like Outback but not at the level of Ruth Chris or Capital Grill. I won't go into detail on the atmosphere it was a crowded Saturday night but it was clean and had a cottage in the woods type decor. 

They have a good drink menu with speciality cocktails. My fiancée ordered the siesta sangria which she loved. The food received mixed reviews from the two of us. I ordered the surf and turf--filet and lobster--which I thought was prepared perfectly and had good flavor. The size of the lobster made up for the fact that the steak wasn't quite 7 oz. I would choose a different side next time the French fries were the worst part of the meal. The lady ordered the prime rib which was a little tough and bland. Overall it wasn't a bad evening and I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"This review is for two recent visits to Firebirds, one for dinner and one for lunch.  Both were excellent.  The Ranch Onion Rings are the best in recent memory.  The salmon and the Delmonico steak were cooked perfectly.  The wait times were about an hour for dinner and around 15 mins for lunch, but both well worth the time investment."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the atmosphere in this place is amazing! We had a large party and they sat us immediately even though our entire party wasn't present which was great! When seated, our servers were very organized with our orders and very knowledgeable on the menus as well. The only issues we experienced were one of my friends ordered the salmon and it was severely undercooked but they corrected that issue right away. Also the crab cake appetizers we ordered were not seasoned at all. Other than that we will be back again minus ordering those items."}
{"text":"Went here last night with fellow associates from work - all of us here from CT for business. The food and service was phenomenal. The food was cooked exactly to the request. The server was extremely friendly and when she was not sure about a drink request, she asked the bartender and provided several options for the one person. One associate requested the steak well done (against our recommendations), but did not like it; she casually mentioned it to our server and the meal was taken off her bill - great customer service."}
{"text":"Not sure if they have napkins or silverware for to go orders, but our salads did not include them.  To eat my salad, I had to rip a piece of bread like a spoon and scoop up salad to eat.  So be sure to ask for silverware."}
{"text":"What a great experience! We love this place but today took it to a whole new level. Birthday dinner reservations. No big deal, right? Wrong! We showed up to our reserved table set with balloons and all. 

To top that all off, our waiter, Matt, was simply amazing. Great service. He even folded napkins if people went to the restroom. The birthday boy came back from the restroom pleasantly surprised. He now wants to come to Firebirds every year on his birthday beating a 7 year favorite restaurant of his. 

The general manager was also very great. Checked in on us at the right times and also assisted at times. 

And the food? It's Firebirds. Great food. I've not had anything bad there. My favorites are the tortilla soup and the fried spinach. Today I tried their signature Black Diamond Martini. Wow! That drink is great!

We left very impressed overall. Thank you for making this a birthday dinner to remember!"}
{"text":"Seems this place would be a better night time spot as when me and my mates went there for lunch it was empty. That being said the service was still very slow. When the food did come out it was average. I had the fire grilled salmon which was pretty tasty but the rest of my party didn't seem too impressed with their choices."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and were seated fairly quickly for a party of four.  It's a pretty typical steak house with solid martini's and attentive service.  We started with the coconut shrimp and they were cooked perfectly with two lovely dipping sauces.  For dinner, I had the steak salad.  It came with a large portion of steak and fresh greens.  Solid meal for a chain!"}
{"text":"I've been to firebirds before and it's been really good, but unfortunately this time I'm leaving a bad review.   I ordered the 7 oz filet and the server suggested I butterfly the steak so it only takes 20 mins instead of 30.  I've eaten plenty of filets in my time and no one has ever asked me to butterfly my filet.  I agreed and asked for med well.  That was a complete mistake!  My steak was like a piece of over done thin piece of cardboard with an overdose of salt on top.   Someone else In my party ordered the salmon that required a knife to cut it because it was still raw inside... gross!   The only thing that was enjoyable crab queso as our appetizer and the fudge brownie at the end.  Unfortunately I probably won't be back for a full on dinner, but would suggest just sticking to the bar food and drinks."}
{"text":"OMGosh...the sesame encrusted salmon with garlic mashed and deep fried spinach is seriously the best combination with salmon I have EVER had. SO good. AND...the spinach salad...the BLT salad...the Black diamond martini...the bread...the steaks....I could seriously go on...and on... and....LOVE Firebirds!!"}
{"text":"Such a great resturant.  First time going there today. I order shrimp tacos, got the mahi tacos which were delicious too. The server fixed it with no problem.  Cory the manager is a great person.  Not many managers are hands on. The server was great to, I just do not remember his name. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Wow what can I say?! This place is amazing. Service was excellent, the food was amazing and the GF menu is big! I would highly recommend going here for dinner.
I should also add that the mushrooms are off the charts delicious.  I've never had mushrooms this good."}
{"text":"Meet a friend here for lunch last Saturday. The fried chicken salad was a little to wet for my liking. The coconut shrimp was ok...nothing to write home about.  However, the service was exceptional! Our waiter Jay was very attentive, engaging and friendly."}
{"text":"Good solid restaurant that has a decent selection of different types of food. I decided to go out of my comfort zone, and got the meatloaf and mashed potatoes and green beans. My partner got a baked potato and a steak. The baked potato was the star of the evening. How can a baked potato shine? Well for one thing it has to do with the preparation, the cooking and all of that. They wash and roll the potatoes in salt it seems, and so when baked they get a crispy sheen to them. Interesting. The steak was prepared as ordered and was a nice cut of meat. My meatloaf was good, as was the mashed potatoes. The green beans were ... well, you know, just green beans. The pecans did nothing to add to the taste. But the thing is my plate was like covered with food. It was more than two people could have eaten ... I mean really. It was good too, if you like that sort of food ... I was feeling cold, and wanted something to stick in place for a while ... that was a success in that department. All in all a good outing."}
{"text":"Thought  I would meet some friends at Firebirds-Southpark. This was my first time at the restaurant. Service was excellent. I am so inclined to agree with Krishan. Greeted promptly by the host and introduced to Matt, our server. I had the Steak Sandwich cooked medium well. It too was great.  The seasoned fries were a bit lukewarm but tolerable. The lemonade was profound, but for 3.50 I thought I should have gotten at least one  free refill. Overall my experience was great and I do plan to make a return visit."}
{"text":"The positive: the service was fine, but slow. The decor was very warm and comfortable.
I had heard so many good things about this place, we were dying to try it. My husband ordered a steak, my daughter got a regular cheeseburger, and I had a French dip sandwich. While my sandwich was fine, there was nothing special about it. My daughter didn't like the cheeseburger at all, and the steak looked... average... with no comment about it from my husband. My daughter thought we should have just gone to SmashBurger and I agreed that the French Dips at Arby's were better than what I had. So... a big disappointment and a bill for over $75 that could have been well-spent elsewhere. Save your money and time!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for our 5 year anniversary on 6/16. Not only was the food delicious and perfectly cooked, but the service was great as well. They were a little backed up and we hadn't even noticed the Ranch rings we ordered were taking a while but the manager came up to us and apologized for the late appetizer and discounted our bill! Great service and great food! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good service. Decent wine list. Reliably good food. Bread is crusty and tasty. Wood fired grill. Pineapple martinis are not to be missed."}
{"text":"I always have cravings, this time it was for a char-broil burger, so of course I went to Firebirds Wood Fired Grill.  Thankfully my dining companion and I were seated immediately.  We both ordered burgers.  The wait for the burgers was longer than expected but they were served exactly as ordered and hot off the grill.  I had to say that because several restaurant kitchens on the same caliber as Firebirds refuse to prepare burgers as specified or the server is not writing down the order correctly because they are either served barely warm, the bun is not toasted, the meat is not cooked as ordered or something else is always wrong.  

On this occasion of dining at Firebirds, my burger was good but not great like it usually is.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the entire burger because it was good and juicy, it's just that something was missing and I don't know what it was but I'll return and order another burger.  I enjoy the mellow atmosphere Firebirds Wood Fired Grill and the servers are always pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Went to the SouthPark location on Saturday evening. Food was excellent and so was the service. Wish the dessert selection was a little better."}
{"text":"Born and raise in Maryland and now a resident of Arizona for the past 6 years, I am constantly searching for good crab cakes. I am a huge seafood lover / self-designated crab cake connoisseur and it has been TOUGH to find any remotely decent here in the middle of the desert. My husband has even (jokingly) banned me from ordering them because I am always disappointed.
Well folks, the end of my 6 year search has come to an end. Firebird's crab cake are the bee's knees, the cat's pajama's, the stuff that dreams are made of! It probably helps that they are a national chain and not an Arizona desert location only, but they are here and they are GOOOOOOD. 
In addition to said crab cakes we also might have had other food, I vaguely remember some bread, my husband had the Delmonico steak and my main course a Cesar salad. I opted to add shrimp (did I mention that I love seafood) and oh-my-god-I-could-not-even finish them, they were wayyyy too overly seasoned and insanely salty. I guess you can't win 'em all.
Another small bummer was that they do not have my fav wine by the glass (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc). Only by the bottle. I don't like Sauvignon Blancs from California grapes (tastes like dirt), so I had the Reisling instead. Still good, just not my first choice. 
There does always seem to be a significant wait for a table when we come in. So perhaps consider making a reservation? We were quoted 25 minutes at around 8 on a Friday evening, but were lucky enough to score a table in the bar which is open seating. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Overall, 4 stars - enjoyable ambiance, good food, good wine, and fantastic crab cakes!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner at 5:30 on a Sunday. We sat outside (no wait) and our waitress showed up quickly to ask for drink orders. We ordered the quesadilla, kids chicken tenders, bacon cheeseburger, blue cheese filet, trout, blt salad and chicken tortilla soup. We got 2 salads instead of 1 soup and 1 salad, waitress corrected. All the food tasted very good, service was very good as well. Long Island was very good on the first round but second had to be sent back for correction. Overall a good meal and if we were in that area again some other time we would consider going back."}
{"text":"Steak was juicy and full of flavor.  Great atmosphere really good service even with a full house.  No doubt that we will return for another meal soon."}
{"text":"Really good place to meet up friends. We had a party of four to have dinner here, we will come back for sure."}
{"text":"We love Firebirds and we've been going here for over 3 years. Fantastic food. Awesome beverages and we always get excellent service. My filet last night was one of the best I've ever had (and I've eaten at some nice steak houses in scottsdale) even when it's less than perfect (which has only happened once) the service was so stellar it was still a pleasant experience. They surprised us with a beautiful and tasty dessert last night for our anniversary. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here based off of friend recommendations. I was not disappointed. They truly made our anniversary great. The coconut shrimp was delicious. Our steaks were cooked perfect. Service was impeccable. The manager even came by and verified how rare my husband wanted his steak. He joked with my husband about that's how a steak should be cooked. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time I had been here for years. It was incredibly busy on a Friday night. There was a long wait to get a table and the hostess apologized. Rain brought in extra customers and rain discouraged them from leaving. The bar was packed but we were able to get a seat eventually. My martini was good but with more than one bartender things got confused. Once at our table we had good service. He talked us into a Chilean Cabernet that was pretty good though I thought it a little overpriced. Three of us had prime rib with a loaded baked potato. The prime rib was tasty but loaded with fat... more than I am used to seeing. The potato was good but the toppings didn't lubricate it to the bottom so it was rather dry. The fourth had trout and liked it a lot. I wasn't hungry enough to want dessert. Good experience.  Good service on a crazy busy evening. Price was fair. This is always a good place to go."}
{"text":"Great Meal and Friendly Staff. Try the wings! They are delicious! Everything on the menu looks great. Decent prices for a steakhouse."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you're looking for a great steak that won't break the bank.  I ordered the ribeye medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked.  The chicken quesadilla appetizer was phenomenal as well.  The service was fast and attentive.

My only real gripes were underseasoned mashed potatoes and an odd tasting cocktail both of which are easily remedied."}
{"text":"Couple appetizers and desserts. White chocolate mousse and creme brulee cheesecake is really good. Inside is noisy, patio is great"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and top level service. Sit on patio and enjoy the fire. Yum!"}
{"text":"Today, October 03, 2012 my wife and I had lunch here again. In AZ, there are not many Firebirds Restaurants. Therefore we enjoy dining here when in the area. It's unlike many other Restaurants. The food and service is always very good. I consider a cooked to order meal for two costing $27.46+ tip as low cost/cheap! When you add up all the extras at a fast food stand (I will not refer to those as restaurants) the final cost will hit this mark. So why settle for kept warm fast food?

Today, my wife ordered a med cooked Blue Cheese Burger with Sweet Potato fries. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich as it's the best one around. The burger arrived as ordered. My sandwich also arrived as ordered and was filling. 

Leah was our waitress and did a great job! I ordered diet coke and she served refills without hunting her down-great! The Restaurant Manager on duty visited our table to check on our meal. That's a sign of great customer service. We high recommend Firebirds and will dine here again!"}
{"text":"I still love Firebirds.  Recently I bought some gift certificate deal that was buy $100, get $20 or something like that, so we've been over here a lot.  I love the happy hour deals.  I love the early bird dinners, Mon-Thurs, 4-6.  You get a choice of 3 salads and 6 or 7 entrees for $14.95.  Can't beat it.  And I love one of those pomegranate HH cocktails for 5 bucks....Perfect!  The two bartenders that have been working lately are awesome too.  One guy, one gal, and they are really friendly without hovering and do a great job.  I start even thinking about Firebirds and we are going.  That.  Is.  It."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom - this southpark location has become a go to favorite for myself and my husband on date night.  It's close, it's delicious and the service is always great.  

We're big fans of steak and my husband is partial to the prime rib with a loaded baked potato and creamy horseradish sauce.  The blt salad is a great light meal or entree teaser. And the dessert options are decadent, most recently we had a creme brûlée cheesecake but could have easily gone for a delish martini, port or glass of vino.  Our server tommy went out of his way to craft a great lil happy 5th anniversary plate for us.  

Great time, good food and excellent service.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The colors and decore make it feel super cozy, especially by the fireplace in the bar area.  I wasn't a big steak eater but once my boyfriend took me here I turned into one.  Staff is super friendly and when I want steak... this is my favorite place!"}
{"text":"New spot for me. Upon entry it looks like a nicer, upscale steakhouse. 

I kinda stood there for a little bit before a hostess said anything. We were seated and soon greeted by our server. I was catching up with a friend I hadn't seen in awhile so we took awhile to order. Our server was verybpatiwnt and not once did I feel rushed. He was very pleasant and accommodating. We started with a few cocktails, had the ahi tuna as an appetizer and then I has the salmon. The food itself was good. Nothing to unique or different from other steakhouses seafood dishes. 

What stood out to me..the service! Our server was great!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband the other night and was very happy. The fireplace in the bar is beautiful,  really made for an amazing ambiance.  The service was excellent, she was very attentive to us. The food was delicious, very flavorful. We will be back and I highly recommend trying out this place, you wont be disappointed.  The only thing I would change is they need a few more options on the menu, Ilike to have more to choose from. Prices are also very reasonable, great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Firebirds has solid food but not anything that really stands out. I've never had a bad meal here but I've also never had an amazing one. Firebirds the type of restaurant you go to when a) you're dining with someone with a less adventurous palate or b) you're in a big group and want a variety of entrees to choose from.

They have a fairly large menu of basic anerican standbys: fish, chicken, steaks, and burgers. They do all of these things fairly well from my experience and I've been here many times since my mom loves this place. I'm not a liquor drinker but I've heard their cocktails are good.

The reason that firebirds isn't in four star territory is that the food, though fresh and decent quality, just isn't that flavorful. Based on their current menu, it looks like they're trying to do more creative things with their good by offering various sauces and different encrusted fishes but they just haven't mastered using these flavors to enhance the food. Case in point: I got the chili rubbed delmonico last time I was there but didn't taste any chili though the steak itself was solid. I had a similar issue with the green chili mac and cheese (a shame because green chili is awesome and not something that shows up often in restaurants outside the southwest).

In summary, thus isn't a place I ever choose to go to on my own but I also don't protest when my mother inevitably suggests it during my visits."}
{"text":"If you like mushrooms you must try the port mushroom appetizers.  They're delicious!!!   It's got the right amount of sweetness from the wine marinade, piping hot right off the stove, and is cooked to perfection all the time.  These 'shrooms will make your taste buds stand at attention.

If you like bread before your meals Firebirds will not disappoint.  The bread comes out warm and will warm even the coldest of hearts.

Nuff said.

observation - On a totally unrelated note - I feel like I'm in a ski lodge whenever I step into Firebirds. :p"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. I always get the ribeye with the parmesan mashed and it's perfect. Always cooked right. The Caesar salad is amazing here. Croutons are awesome. My other half gets either the filet or the sirloin and both are good for their cuts. She also always gets a crab cake and loves them."}
{"text":"Great service... even for a  Saturday night. We'd never been for dinner. We had steak (ribeye) and salmon for entrees. Both were cooked just right. Good flavor. Reasonable prices. We'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a hot and fresh loaf of bread while you wait for your meal? Add to that some absolutely homemade lemonade and I was good to go. And that was BEFORE my entree. I had the \"Firebirds Chicken Pasta\" twice now and each time I'm left plenty for lunch leftovers the next day. Check it ouit:

We've also tried the onion rings and they were delicious! Usually I only get them at Yardhouse but I'm happy I tried them here because they were pipin' hot and just the right amount of crunchy.

My husband has approved the Mahi mahi tacos and the shrimp tacos as well.

{"text":"Me and my wife made reservations for our 35th wedding anniversary which is also my wife's birthday. I called a florist to deliver flowers to Firebirds they were more than happy to take them and keep them in a cooler nice and fresh for our dinner table. One of the things that impressed me the most was I called in a half hour before our reservation and asked if they were serving prime rib I spoke to a woman named Molly and she told me yes they did. When we arrived at 7 o'clock sharp and asked about our reservations we were swiftly seated to a VIP table with our flowers beautifully sitting on it. We were attended to immediately and after viewing the menu I decided on some prime rib and lobster with a loaded baked potato and mixed vegetables while my wife ordered the filet mignon and Parmesan mashed potatoes with port mushrooms. Now here's where it gets good they informed me they were out of prime rib bummer that is why I came, then they came back and told me Molly had saved a piece of prime rib for me thinking that I may order it,does anybody do that nowadays what a thoughtful young lady I was so impressed. Anyhow the prime rib was giant and delicious,loaded baked potato quality good ,lobster tail was just what you would expect very good. My wife's fillet mignon melted in her mouth and the Parmesan baked potatoes were also very good, port mushrooms and mixed vegetables were delicious and our whole dining experience was brought together with a beautiful piece of big daddy lemon cake on a plate that said happy anniversary spelled out in different flavors which me and my wife enjoyed immensely thank you so much Firebirds for making my 35th anniversary one I will never forget we will be back for our 36th. Thanks again everyone that served us and made sure everything that was all right I believe our server was Cory she was very nice and attended to us often .David the manager also came over to make sure everything was all right.thanks again Firebirds for all that you did for us!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for my dad's  birthday. Our servers were Lauren and Amanda and they were so sweet and gave us such great service! Everyone loved them and also the food! The steak here is so good! DEFINETLY will be back. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"i will GLADLY spend $20-something on one meal here. GLAD. LY. 

This is what I ate:

Sirloin on the wood grill with green beans. and a side of raw horseradish.  i basically licked my plate. It was one of the best steaks i've had in a LONG time. there were no imperfections on my cut of meat, i was able to eat every single bite of that 12 ounce beautiful hunk of cow. I mean, i wasn't able to eat for the rest of the day but so worth it. I didn't have to trim off any questionable pieces, every bite was perfection.

the flavors of the wood grill are very strong and pure bliss. and the seasoning made me sing. 

and the green beans were rock stars. although, i saw someone dipping the large steak fries in au jus and i got a little jealous that i didn't order fries but maybe next time. 

and i mean, if you think about it, since this is all i ate that day it averaged out to like $10 per meal if i pretend to divide it out and that's a steal!"}
{"text":"My daughter in law's mother and sister took me to this restaurant on Saturday.  We started with the onion rings, had various salads and potatoes and ended with the crème brulee cheesecake.  First off-- extraordinary service!  Team atmosphere for service without being overwhelming, and truly nice and efficient gentlemen.  My BLT salad was fantastic and the onion rings were probably the best I have ever had anywhere.  AND I'M OLD!! But--- and that's a big butt in my case---the cheesecake was absolutely fantastic.  A crackly top like a brulee on top of fantastic cheesecake on top of superb crust.  I cannot say enough about my first trip to a restaurant, except that I wish they would come to Chicago!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! The service is always great, wine list is awesome, and the steaks are top notch. The bleu cheese filet is amazing as well as the coconut shrimp appetizer. This is our go-to steakhouse in Chandler!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Firebird. It was nice and cozy. The food was great but the waiter was a little delayeddd sided just a bit. We should have saw the slow response coming because he took awhile to wait on us once we sat down. We finally ordered and the food took a good minute to come. We had the smoke chicken appetizer with the sauce on the side. The bread is good too. It was a butt bread!  lol  We tried the coconut shrimp with fries. The meal comes with two sides and I went with all French fries. Now we know that means double on the fries but I guess they didn't know that because we only got about 10 fries on the plate. I guess since they are a little big they only give you small amounts. We tried the fresh squeeze lemonade which was not fresh squeeze since it turned out to have spirit mixed in with it. I don't know how it is fresh squeeze and hand made lemonade.. huh  I don't know!!  It was a bit tangy to the taste, so I ordered some sweet tea. It was great! :) Then we needed ketchup for the fries. It seem like the waiter had to go to the store to pick it up. It took a good while before he bought us the ketchup. Once we had our ketchup we were good to go. The ambience and the restaurant itself is nice. We may return... hoping to get a different waiter. I guess the 3 tables of five people were just a bit to much for him tonight."}
{"text":"Food was good service was good price is a bit high for what you get but overall good place worth a drop in."}
{"text":"Went back here last night with my Wife and her father and brother.  The food was, as usual, very solid.  However, while the service is also usually very good, it was exceptional last night.  My father-in-law ordered the strip steak Medium Rare.  It came out Medium or Medium well.  After my father-in-law told our waitress, the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered a free soup or salad.  He ordered the soup which the manager brought out instantly.  About 5 minutes or so later, the manager brought the new steak, apologizing for the delay and told us that the steak would now also be free because of the short delay.  Phenomenal customer service- probably one of the reasons there was a 20-30 minute wait at 6 PM on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"From start to finish this was a 5 Star experience!

We booked our reservation 3 days early, over the phone-- I got a text confirmation which was a nice touch!

When we arrived the day of our reservation we were greeted by amazing hostesses! Everyone welcomed us in and let us know we could go have drinks before our table was ready. The infused pineapple cocktail and pomegranate margarita were to die for! Happy hour was until 7 so we took advantage! Cocktail waitresses were delightful and fun. 

When we got sat we met our server Cara! She was training a male server, both were helpful and suggested great menu items. She really knew her stuff!

We all ordered the BLT salad-- a must have! 

Dinner--two of us had filet mignon wrapped in bacon with blue cheese (ORDER THIS!). Shrimp skewer was flavorful and had a grilled lemon to squeeze on top (so unique). Another person had a French dip, large portion and very juicy. All of us had mushroom sides and they are soaked in port wine and then cooked-- holy moly! Such a perfect pairing with all the flavors. Everything was savory!

Dessert was white chocolate mousse with cherries and fruit-- beautiful presentation with the happy birthday and candle.

Chris and Tyrell (managers) came and checked in on us and introduced themselves. We got to learn their backgrounds and it sounded like they were really excited to be working at the new Firebirds. Very nice personal touch. 

We were so glad to hear that this restaurant was coming to Gilbert (weve previously ate at the Tucson location) but I think we were all pleasantly surprised at the genuine amazing service and incredible food!

We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, and the food was even better. I took my family here for Father's Day, and I'm so happy that I did. We tried appetizers, entrees, sides, and dessert. Everything that we ordered was so scrumptious! The only thing wrong with the meal was that my steak was cooked incorrectly. When I let my server know, she promptly made sure that the issue was fixed to our satisfaction. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"Hey fellow Yelpers, I wanted to write a short review for Firebirds Wood Fired Grill at Stonecrest. My family and I decided to have a dinner out for the first day of the new year here and it was as expected a great time with great food. I say as expected because we've been here many times and only once have we had a issue which was quickly resolved. The food has always been cooked as ordered which is important because I like my steak rare or medium rare and my family enjoys the burgers, salads and seafood. On this evening even though they were busy, our waitress Veronica was excellent, timely and made sure everything was good.

Sometimes it good to make a reservation especially on the weekends otherwise the wait time could take approximately 15 to 30 minutes. The atmosphere and ambiance is very nice, the sound level is average for a steakhouse. The food and appetizers come in big portions so don't fill up on appetizer and bread otherwise you'll be taking a box to go which isn't really a bad thing. The service has always been great and any issues that arise the management has taken care of it quickly and professionally. 

The prices are slightly pricey but again the portion sizes are plentiful and you will not leave hungry. Finally, while I can't put Firebirds up there with Mortons, Ruth's Chris or Del Frisco's Double Eagle, etc...Firebirds does well for itself and what they offer. Hope you enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Probab!y one of the best steakhouses I've been to.  Food was excellent.  I ordered a steak sandwich (can't remember the name)with a side of homemade beef stew.  The stew was unbelievabe and incredibly meaty.  When i got the sandwich i was a.little dissapointed because there were no fries.  But i didn't realize that i had a choice of fries, salad, or soup.  And i chose the soup.  So i just ordered some anyway.  No big deal.  Well i wouldn't have ordered the fries if i knew big the brownie with ice cream was going to be that i got for dessert and it was absolutely deiicious.   It was also my birthday and they put a candle on top of my brownie and even signed a birthday card with the employees names on it.  Not bad for a first time experience.  Last but not least was abby or aubrey( sorry terrible with names) our waitress.  She was absoutely wonderful a class act all the way.  Even when my mother's order got messed up.  Which incidently i believe was my mother's fault because she speaks real soft.  She handled it with grace.  she is an awesome waitress and i hope she reads this.  Anyway can't say enough about this place and i definitely will be back.  If your in the area give it a try i think you'll be pleasantly suprised."}
{"text":"Recently moved back to Charlotte after 6 years away and Firebirds was a must to try out again. We were initially disappointed because the server took my drink order, but ignored my husband.  She may have been distracted by the table of 6 next to us, but then he requested his salad without dressing and it came loaded down.  My prime rib came at the same time and it was very fatty.  Because she never returned to see if everything was to our satisfaction I got a manager who entirely turned our evening around.  Immediately the chef appeared with an entire new dinner for the me and the steak was beautiful and cooked to perfection.  It became  a PERFECT evening when the desert came.  Really can not wait to return.  The server was incredibly professional about the glitches and gave us wonderful service following."}
{"text":"Although there were definitely some highlights, which I will note in this review, I have to give this place a 3/5 stars overall. 

Firebirds Wood Fired Grill is a newly opened restaurant just past San Tan Village shopping mall, next to Living Spaces. It has a lovely decor on the inside. I came here with my parents on a Monday evening. As we approached the door, a very friendly lady opened the door for us with a smile, but as we walked into the other main door, I just saw blank faces. There were 3 people at the main entrance and no one said hello or welcomed us into the restaurant. No one asked about how many people were in our party, so I had to take the initiative to say something first, even though it wasn't busy and there weren't any other people waiting.

The friendly lady who opened the door for us walked us to our table. Shortly thereafter, we were greeted by our waiter. It was our first time here, so we wanted a minute to look over the menu items. We got our drinks order in a timely manner and received them in a short amount of time. As odd as it sounds, I was really disappointed with the size of the water glass. It's half the size of a glass that lemonade or other drinks come in; I drink a lot of water, so it didn't last me long...I waited for our waiter to refill my water, but he never appeared after we placed our order. The restaurant was obviously not that busy, as I saw many waiters standing around in the back, chatting, and some doing training of table settings at other empty tables. I had to ask a different waiter for some more water.

While we were waiting for our meals, my mother pointed out that a few tables around us, that had been seated about 15-20 minutes after us, had gotten bread and butter at their table. We weren't sure if it was free, so I got the attention of a waiter that was walking past us to ask about the bread. He got our waiter, and then our waiter got us bread...I was disappointed to see that it took so long for us to get the complimentary bread, despite all the other tables around us receiving their share. On top of the delay, my father bit into a piece of bread and found a long, black hair baked into the bread. We told our waiter, he got the manager, and he apologized, saying that they don't bake their own bread and have it outsourced. That was that. 

We finally got our order, which came in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a medium ribeye steak, which was cooked beautifully. There are plenty of options for sides, including fruit, which they will gladly accommodate for any allergies. My father ordered the shrimp and steak with a side of mashed potatoes. He ordered it well down, and it was warm and not too salty. My mother ordered the wood-fired shrimp salad; the shrimp, unfortunately, was cold, maybe due to the fact that it had been cooked and put under the \"warmer\" while our steaks were being cooked...she did say that the salad/slaw portion of her meal was delicious.

Overall, I was expecting a lot more from Firebirds, especially for what the price that you pay. For an establishment like this, I would expect great service and great food. It didn't meet those standards, especially in the service department. I would understand the mishaps if it was super busy, but the evening we came, there were plenty of empty tables and multiple wait staff standing around and chatting. It is still relatively new, so there are kinks that they can work out, so I may consider trying this place out again. I would rate food as 3.5-4/5 and service as 2.5-3/5. I hope that service is better for you if you decide to try this place out."}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was wonderful. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. I had the peppercorn encrusted steak-- perfectly done, very flavorful, and so delicious! I also ordered the Firebird BLT salad. My only \"complaint\" was that it had a bit too much bacon. Their signature pineapple martini was to die for! The perfect amount of sweet and tanginess. I'm giving this 4 stars because their wine list was just so so and our server kept pushing the restaurant's new wine. Also, the desert selection was not great-- there was nothing really creative on there that really excited me."}
{"text":"Ok. Not only is the food great, but the service is AMAZING! They are so attentive, from your server, to the manager, to the water person. Super friendly. My mom visits from Michigan a lot, and she says \"let's go to that nice restaurant that has the great service!!\" She comes out here about twice a year, but remembered Firebirds for their service. I've had amazing steak, dessert, fish and wine. I love to bring out of town people here whenever they visit. I highly reccomend the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that I've dubbed 'hit or miss' over the years but I recently attended a bridal shower here and I must say on this visit I was quite impressed with the food.  I started with the chicken tortilla soup which was cream based and very tasty and for lunch I ordered the spinach salad with salmon.....OMG it was so very good!  It was spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, eggs, applewood-smoked bacon, and balsamic vinaigrette.....I could have done without half the bacon but I don't recall ever having a salad that good and that alone will turn me into a regular....at least for now:-)"}
{"text":"I have to give credit to the Manager and our Waiter before i start talking smack. They did a wonderful job at easing our troubles that we had with the hostess. This was my first time there, I was with my partner on a tuesday afternoon and it wasnt very busy. We asked for a booth, we followed her and she then tried to sit us at this half table, half booth thing. If they were busy and this was the only table that would have been fine but there was plenty of other 2 sided booths available. When we asked her if we could sit at another booth, She gave this big sigh and said follow me. Now normally they hostess would take you to another booth and then go back to the front to fix the seating chart. But not her, she made us follow her back up to the front and then back out into the dining area and sat us. The whole time mind you copping attitude at us. So within the first 20 seconds we had experienced this bs. We let our waiter know the situation, he let the Manager know and he quickly came to our aid. Was very appolgetic and comped our appetizer. So we are enjoying our food which was extremely good. Mmmmm. and we see the manager and the hostess go into the back. 10min later we see her storm throught the restaurant and then see her walk out into the parking lot. He sent that B*tch home!!!! I was amazed....never had that happen before. Right before we were about to leave he gave us a 10$ gift card to come back.....booyah"}
{"text":"Started out with the BLT salad - that was really nice!

Asked if I should order the Chile rubbed Delmonico or the aged ribeye for my entrée - server said to get the ribeye with the chile rub - ok says I, I'd like that **RARE** (yes, I order -rare - underline it, stars on both sides, and circle it - because if you're not in Hawaii, it's going to get overcooked otherwise).  That and a loaded baked potato.
One of the others in our party ordered the filet, medium well.
The steaks arrived, and I was really looking forward to it, after the terrific salad...cut into it...hmm...kind of overdone...tried the other side...medium well...
My friend's filet was beautifully rare.
Neither of us were very happy about it.  
I feel guilty sending overcooked steaks back (hey, the cow gave it's all for the steak - don't throw it away) - good thing I got the chile rub - that made it acceptable.

Really disappointed - had the steak been cooked the way I ordered it, this would've gotten 5 stars.  :-("}
{"text":"Spinach salad was great!!  Steaks and lobster just O.K.  We might give Firebirds a second chance, later."}
{"text":"Tossed salad is served with an even coating of dressing, which is a rarity these days. Too often I find a bunch of crispy greens sitting in my bowl after I've exhausted the smidgen of dressing they give at most restaurants. The ribs are tender and tangy, the mashed potatoes are the perfect cap off complement. Our server, Michael, helped elevate the dining experience by providing great service. Strongly recommend to anyone with a hankering for a delicious meat-and-potatoes meal."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for an excellent steak dinner. Our server Tom was on his game with drink selections including special reduced pricing, and the dinner specials to include discounted meals.Our four meals, including various steaks, seafood, and prime rib were fresh, delicious,  and as advertised. We never had to wait for service. Managing partner Corey ensured that we were being well taken care of. We will return again and again. Sincerely, Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is easily one of my new favorite places!  The manager, Jeff, was super helpful in piecing something that my sister could eat. (She has multiple food allergies) Our server was very nice and talkative, he recommended the Kobe Beef Meatloaf (which I also recommended to everyone coming) to my dad and the Parmesan Mahi to me. I loved the atmosphere and the bar decor, it was all very welcoming! I highly recommend this establishment to anyone coming here looking for good food."}
{"text":"Service was very poor. Finished a drink and was not even offered a second. Food was fine but no better than an outback. Other locations seem to be better ran."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Firebirds Wood Fired Grill. I went with a group of six for dinner.
The service was first class, the atmosphere and decor was very nice.
I should have taken a clue from the other guest at the table when everyone buy my wife and I ordered a fish dish for their entree.
I ordered the Spinach Salad with the extra add on of their Crab Cakes and the Sirloin Steak with Baby Portobello Mushrooms
The salad was great, the dressing very complementary with the spinach salad, but the crab cakes were tasteless, and were twice the cost of the salad to be added on. They were supposed to be seasoned with Old Bay Seasoning for flavor. I don't think they remembered to add it to mine or to my wife's crab cake appetizers. We both thought they were bland and tasteless. My wife asked for her steak to be done medium rare, my  steak was to be done medium. Both of our steaks were overcooked. Her steak came out Medium, my steak came out burnt meat matter well done grey, (YUCK) The Baby Portobello's were plentiful but needed to be better seasoned and cooked longer. I like mushrooms that are not Al dente.
The Parmesan crusted Mahi Mahi was the hit of the table. If I go back again this will be what I order. The flavor of the crust was perfect, The fish was a fresh thick filet cooked to perfection.
 Two of the quests ordered the Pecan Encrusted Trout, And one ordered the Simiply Grilled Mahi. They all raved about how good there food tasted, that I regretted not getting a fish entree
My wife tried their house special Pineapple Martini and thought it was good but not great 
she still prefers the Lemon Drop Martinis."}
{"text":"They need to do something about the acoustics. There were 4 of us and we nearly had to shout across the table to be able to understand each other. The food was average to above average at best; certainly wouldn't rank as excellent. One of my guests ordered the same dish as I did, requested to be cooked identically as that of mine. When both came out, not only were they not cooked remotely close to each other, but it tasted different too. How's that for consistency, or should I say inconsistency?

The server was attentive, but all of us could clearly tell, the server was trained for a high pressure hard sell. Would anyone like to order our signature cocktail? Are you sure? Would you like to order some wine? Are you sure? Would we like to order a starter? Are you sure? Would you like to add a side salad to our entree? Are you sure? Would you like to add an additional side dish? Are you sure? Would you like to order some desserts? Are you sure?

Nah, I think I'll pass on returning to this place. I want to be able to enjoy dinner without any difficulties in hearing each other. As a result, this is definitely not the place for power meeting of any kind.

ADDENDUM: This portion of the review is added after Leslie M.'s response to my original post publicly as well as through messaging through Yelp. While I commend their willingness and speedy engagement of their patrons, I have no desire to give them my email. If I happened to be there in the future coincidentally, I will find out whether or not the place has changed for the better. On the other hand, I will not make a conscious decision to go back, drink, eat, and the pay to find out if the positive changes have been made; I will not be subjected to take such a risk. A risk to spend money and find that, NOTHING has changed. The only suggestion I can make to the management is to make the necessary change to be able to hold on to the first time diners for the future."}
{"text":"I have never gone wrong at Firebirds. I have been coming to this location for almost 10 years now. I love everything from their Delicious Salmon and Steak to their Sliders and Martini's. I have not been to lunch or dinner in a while. I have been a huge fan of the Happy Hour lately (4 to 6:30) $5.00 Double Black Diamond Martini is my go to. Its their specialty. Fresh pineapple infused for 21 days with Svedka All Natural CitronVodka and garnished with a sweet pineapple slice. They are pretty addicting. And for 5 bucks?! Come to mama!! Signature cocktails for 6 dollars, glasses of wine for 5, and 2 dollars off of all draft beers. As for the Happy Hour food. I really enjoyed the Crispy Mahi Tacos. The flower tortilla was soft but held up nicely to the large piece of perfectly beer battered, flaky, fried Mahi with cabbage, avocado pico, and spicy Sriracha sour cream. Also the Beef Sliders. Tender juicy beef, with smoked cheddar, pickles and catsup, on a grilled fluffy bun, over a mustard sauce. Its like a gourmet version of a McDonalds Hamburger. The Smoked Salmon Dip could have used a some more liquid smoke, and instead of seasoned toast, I think maybe some flatbread or something like that would be a bit better. It was not bad, just my opinion that it could be better. 

In the past when I have gotten the steaks, they have always had great flavor and always cooked the way I order (Medium Rare of course.) The Salmon has always been one of my favorite things here. Flaky with that perfect smoky flavor. My favorite side to get there is the Parmesan Mashed Potatoes. Speaks for themselves. I'm not huge on dessert. So there for I couldn't tell you anything about it but I have never had one thing I didn't like so I'm sure they will not disappoint. And of course the staff is always warm, welcoming, and attentive. 

Thank you Firebirds for always being delicious and consistent. See you soon."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have ordered something different. My first invention was to get the prime rib or the special on a separate menu the scallops. Well since the restaurant specialty is \"Fire Grilled\" I thought what could be better than a fire grilled rib eye. I know mine's are great when I grill at home. Well what a disappointment. I ask for a medium and it was. So why was it so tough and dry? According to the menu it says aged. However, I'm pretty sure it wasn't nor did it have that marble appearance of a good cut. I've had better rib eye at less expensive chain restaurants. My husband had the tenderloin which was better. I think the restaurant as a whole isn't bad, so I will probably go again but I will never get another rib eye."}
{"text":"You ever have someone talk you out of getting something, only to regret listening to them in the first place, wishing you had gone with your first mind??? Yea well that happened tonight when my dude convinced me to get muthafreakin Firebirds over some trusty Asian food. Why did I listen to him??? I'm laying in the bed right now, feenin for something. 

I'm on a meat and veg diet... don't judge. It's working. Two lbs in two days baby! 

Anywho I was craving some sort of meat and veg stir fry and what better place to get some than at an Asian joint. I said this out loud and as usual hubs chimes in with a bright idea. Only this time, not too bright, cause he suggested this spot. 

I go for some wangs and a Cesar salad with a crab cake. 

Wings: extremely crispy. Almost inedible. Also lukewarm, rather than hot. Barely any spice. I hate dry wings. Where's the sauce dammit! The first wing I bit into was all crispy skin. No meat. How thats possible, I don't know. The wings were also salty as shit. Like someone dropped a salt shaker in the bag and executed a poor attempt with rinsing them off. Blue cheese was good. Unfortunately that was the only highlight of that box of food. 

Salad: lettuce looked good, fresh. The dressing was okay. I've had way better. Couldn't eat the croutons. You know... diet and all. It was a big portion. 

Crab cake: tasted like your everyday, run of the mill, 2.5 star crab cake. Like something you would get from a subpar spot. Didn't expect the subpar ness for this joint. Ah well! 
 
Service was good. From when I first ordered over the phone, to pick up. Class all the way. 

Why lord! Why!!! 

Y'all don't get it. I'm struggling. I want pasta, chocolate cake, tacos, grapes, grapefruit, ice cream, Futo Buta, a burger, pickles, a milkshake, bread, Spinach and artichoke dip, some popcorn, and some fries. Like I want all of that... like yesterday. The first couple weeks is the hardest. So my meat and veg game gotta be strong.  

Damn firebirds! You really disappointed me. But you know what? Maybe in say 5-8 months I'll give you another shot. I'll try some real food from your menu. Maybe we can be friends. But you gotta promise me, you won't break my heart again, okay? 

I'll see you soon. Keep a plate hot for me boo."}
{"text":"I have been remiss in not giving a review to a place that my coworkers, friends and of course myself spend so much time at.  This review is for the Chandler location only.  

The list:
- Service - always great!  Greeted promptly, always checked on and it seems there are 2 waitstaff per table.  (I did have a friend tell me that one time only...he was left waiting at his table but that as soon as the waiter & manager found out they went out of their way to make up for the oversite.) 
- Food - Let them bring the bread!!  Save your \"non-carb\" moment for another time!  YUM!  The spinach salad is wonderful and big enought to split especially at lunch. (besides...you have the bread!) I've had a couple steaks and the prime rib, the fish and even dessert.  I swear I've never had bad food here.  Always \"meets or exceeds\" expectations. 
- Beverages:  OK selection of wine (see happy hour below).  The do have some high end wineries on the menu but I find they have good standard wines and throw in a few \"odd balls\" that you don't normally see on a mid priced menu so try one of those.  They do also have a full bar.
- Atmosphere - can be a bit loud.  Especially if people do not remove the screaming children.  :-(  
- Happy Hour - definately do the patio.  When it's chilly they have heaters and a big fireplace.  The sliders are a complete meal!  They also do (I assume they still do) 1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays!!  

So...don't let the fact that it's a chain deter you.  Give them a try.  I think you'll be pleased.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect service. We had a drink and appetizer at the bar. The bar tender was on point. Quick with drinks and food. Lobster spinach queso was very good. 

We will be back here again."}
{"text":"Ordered the filet mignon and was perfect. We ordered a cheeseburger and fries was very pleased had amazing flavor our waitress was very good and attentive."}
{"text":"We loved the bread and Caesar salad. It has a spice to it that's a fresh twist on Caesar but very tasty. Unfortunately the Steak Au Poivre was overdone and not enjoyable. The mahi tacos were good but nothing we would crave. Service was good. 

Bread and salad would be 4-5 stars. Mahi tacos 3-4. The steak really is what dropped it he overall score."}
{"text":"Service at the bar on a dead Wednesday night sucked for me. Don't know why but the bartenders decided to ignore me. It wouldn't have been as bad if they hadn't given the guy sitting right next to me the royal treatment. I had to ask for a menu and then to order. When my food came I tried to get silverware several times before I was able to find some. I don't know; it feels terrible to be ignored like that. I really was shocked. I know it won't matter but ill never come back. First time I have ever given a bad tip."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times and it is always a treat! Servers are so friendly but also classy and professional. We have loved every steak we have ordered and I have to get the delicious loaded baked potato. For birthdays the candle in the dessert is a nice touch. Mmm creme brûlée cheesecake. We'll be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Place is jumpin' on a Monday at 7:45.
The entrance is impressive with a large Mead hall feel to it.
I was seated quickly to a table right up front next to the entrance even with a reservation and told all seats are first come first served. A little odd with a reservation, but not a deal breaker.
Service was quick, efficient and very lively by Laurin who I dubbed \"The Goddess of Hospitality\".
She could work any establishment and enable you enjoy it and appreciate her attention.
I ordered the kabob medium rare with added side of grilled Shrimp and Fat Tire Ale.
Bread was presented with butter. The bread was crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy inside. Unfortunately it was too crisp outside and sawing a slice left chips scattered all over the table. It was good with butter but the outside crisp was a bit too much. Maybe some butter melted on the outside just after baking would have helped.
The plate arrived within 20 minutes, was nicely prepared and looked like a magazine photo.
The steak was tasty but a little chewy with  too much gristle. Fat I am good with, the incredible gristle is unacceptable. Filet should not be this gristle rich but the perfect medium rare made up for the extra chew.
The vegetables were perfect! The mashed potatoes were good but could have had a splash of heavy cream to soften them up.
The Shrimp were cooked about 1 minute 30 seconds too long and that was unfortunate.
They tasted great, just way too chewy, a common theme.
Shrimp and steak both were exercises in chew, but with great flavor.
I never went thirsty as Laurin was expertly attentive. The title Goddess of Hospitality is not easily earned!
Did I mention the place was jumpin! It takes a skilled, caring and intuitive person to be great when business is booming at a place like this.
So a few beers, allot of chewing and a glass of water later and I am satiated. My jaw may be sore tomorrow but my belly is full and I am glad I visited. Management checked in on me and I reported all was well. Sometimes great service just makes it tough to complain even a little. Hospitality makes up for mistakes.
Thank you Laurin for making the starry night meal much better, a great dining experience with her attention. Without her perfect customer service, this would have been a 3 star review.
No biggie, it can be improved on very easily."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 6:45 PM on a Wednesday evening. We got there a little early and checked in at the hostess stand. Instead of giving you a buzzer thing, they take/confirm your phone number and text you when your table is ready. (Hint: Make sure the number they have is for the phone you are carrying!) Anyway, kind of a neat idea... first time I've seen that. There was a good crowd there, especially in the bar area, so things were pretty noisy. We had trouble hearing across the table. Zack, our server, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and competent... he was quite good.

I had the American Kobe beef meatloaf with parmesan mashed potatoes. The meatloaf came to the table piping hot, and covered with a good mushroom sauce that had a bit of a spicy kick. It was delicious! We appreciated the gluten-free menu and choices for my wife. She had the grilled shrimp and strawberry salad and it was excellent. She said she would absolutely get it again.

We would definitely return to this restaurant. My only negative (one star off) was the noise level."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always spectacular.  My fave is the Delmonico with the jalapeño cheddar potato's, trust me you won't be disappointed. Yes it's a little pricy, but service and the food are right up there with places we have paid twice as much for.  There hasn't  been one time we have been unhappy with the food or the service we have received.  This time we even had the manager personally come over and ask us how our meal was, but more importantly how well we were being taken care of! WOW when was the last time that happened to you. You guys are great. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants great service and a great meal! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Took the in-laws here for an anniversary lunch. The food was delicious. Staff was very friendly and attentive - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I can give a no star.

The table ladies in front were unresponsive ice queens.  We were a party of five waiting in front for a good 30 minutes on a Thursday evening.  The customer service was non-existent.  We had enough and left for Famous Dave's.

The servers were listless.  Management is at fault obviously.

I will never ever eat here."}
{"text":"Good food. Great atmosphere. Wonderful service. Kind of expensive though. Food is good but not as good as what it should be for the cost. Went once & I don't think it was outstanding enough for me to return, knowing I'm gonna be dropping $100 on the bill."}
{"text":"i was really looking forward to trying this place so the family and i made our way there.  i asked what their specialty was and they said prime rib.  that was music to my ears.  that being said the wife and i ordered it.  we also ordered a side of jalapeno cornbread.  let's start there.  well....the cornbread was actually sliced toast...really....sliced toast! i mentioned that we thought we were ordering cornbread as in a muffin or loaf and they said \"this is our cornbread.\"  wow...misleading.
now on to the prime rib.  we ordered ours rare and the server came back and said they were out of rare that we would have to settle for medium if we still wanted it.  anyways...we went ahead and ordered it \"medium.\" i was still looking forward to it.  the prime rib showed up and we were stoked....until we tried it.  this thing had absolutely NO flavor to it...not even after you soaked it in the au jus. it was a $22 bad decision.  lame.
i forgot what my kiddo ordered but i will say he barely touched it.
best part about this trip was when we were leaving i was able to feed the left over prime rib to a stray cat sitting outside (yes..i took the leftovers to go...i hate complaining to the staff).
anyways.....don't think i will ever go back here again.  just not worth the money."}
{"text":"Firebirds is delicious and the Southpark location is fantastic!  It's perfect for a nice date night and has a great private room for celebrations or dinner parties. I had my small wedding reception there and the staff was exceptional. Dirty Martini is delicious and steaks are great. Everything we have tried is awesome. I love the grilled salmon on one of their salads. Yum!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites. Delicious pineapple black diamond martinis.  Wonderful salads and main courses. Key lime pie on point. Ambiance awesome"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Firebirds. My husband and I went last night which was a Tuesday. I will say we were shocked to see how slow it seemed. I would like to say when we walked it we were greeted right away and sat immediately with our server Julia not far behind with a drink menu. I loved how she did point out the alcohol drinks but also added the non- making sure she hit all points not knowing if we were drinkers. We ordered the Alex's lemonade in which she seemed very passionate about along with bar drinks. My husband tried her recommendation of the Ricky.. I'm not sure of the actual name but he loved it. She told us about the pineapple drink but did point out the one he had stating they are all good but she is more of a whisky-bourbon person and that this was made with the Jack Daniels rye... which caught his attention perfectly. He normally doesn't drink when we go out so I was surprised. I do want to say I rarely go on any social media unless I am blown away and I will say I was. Since he loved the drink she recommended we did go with her dinner favorites. The prime rib and the chili rubbed Delmonico. Both starting with the BLT salad. How she was able to get us to order a dessert I'm still in wonder because we were beyond full. We did order the cheesecake. She said she normally doesn't like cheesecake but this one was awesome. She was right. She was so personable and it just made the evening so fun and enjoyable. It wasn't like we were just there eating as usual. it felt like we made a friend. My husband was telling her a cheesecake she would love at the Cheesecake factory and everything. I only say this because honestly he never talks to anyone he doesn't have to. This is running very long so I will wrap it up. I really would have given this a five star because our service was beyond what we expected. I am in the business and I just can't say enough about how well she did especially being the second day you were open. Reason for the four star was our bar drinks did take a very long time. Beyond an opening day long. Normally with training staff present you don't see this until perhaps the third of fourth week when all help has left. The manager (female) that walked them over seemed to be nice but definitely not overly and seemed to force her smile. They did comp the drinks but we do not go out for free things. We do look forward to coming back and we will be looking for Julia when we arrive. I will say we did not fill out the pamphlet in the check book that she told us about. I don't like a lot of emails and she did say that wouldn't happen but I play on the side of caution. I wish you the best of luck."}
{"text":"There's nothing like their Double Black Diamond Martini, crab cakes and juicy prime rib!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. My husband and I decided to try this restaurant as part of our move date. My husband had the SLOW ROASTED PRIME RIB* which was Encrusted with fresh herbs and pepper, hand-carved and served with homemade au jus and creamy horseradish sauce. There's 2 choices - 12 oz. * 23.30 | 16 oz. * 26.30. He really enjoyed his meal. I chose the BABY BACK RIBS which had Java BBQ sauce, steak fries, cider slaw * 24.25. 

The cocktails at this restaurants are really good too. They were not watered down and did not disappoint. We had the Firebirds Signature Martini - THE DOUBLE BLACK DIAMOND - had Fresh pineapple infused for 21 days with Svedka All Natural Citron, Vodka and garnished with a sweet pineapple slice. Delicious...

This is a sports bar type atmosphere so if noise bothers you then this is probably not a good fit for you."}
{"text":"The BLT Caesar Salad was amazing! For dinner I had the bacon wrapped filet and that was so tasty! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Party of 6 and everything was fantastic!  As Best Man for my best friend's wedding, I knew the perfect place for lunch before the big \"I DO\" would be Firebirds!  Everyone loved the food.  Out of the 6, 3 had never enjoyed Firebirds before and they are now fans!  Great food (as usual) and great service too.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just passing through and came here based on a recommendation from another traveller at my hotel. Not sure what to expect from a restaurant attached to a suburban mall it indeed far exceeded expectations. Superb fish dishes (salmon and trout) cooked to perfection plus excellent starter (grilled shrimp/strawberry salad) as well as a wide ranging wine last. Very efficient staff and great attitude. Didn't try the desserts but they looked tempting."}
{"text":"This is just about the bar, since I haven't been back for their food because they are too salty for my taste. 

Impressive bar and a great way to end a night. The bar is large, open, and colorful. The patio faces Sharon Road and they have comfortable furniture in a large space. The servers are very friendly.

The fancy drinks are around $9 each and good. Although, I think on Wednesdays some of the drinks are half off. I had some pineapple drink and it was just like kool aid. I slurped it up in no time. 

Go for the nice atmosphere and tasty drinks!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Sunday lunch here. Walked in seated immediately for 2. The service was excellent, we had ordered an appetizer, to which our server noticed we didn't care for, took it away and took care of the charge. He brought us the menu again to see if we wanted something else. Kyle really paid attention to detail and gets our vote as an exceptional server. The food was great along with the atmosphere. We plan on making this place somewhere we will visit a lot."}
{"text":"Visited Firebirds this evening and were delighted.  We were a party of four.  Three ordered prime rib and one the crab cakes.  All of our prime ribs were ordered medium rare and all came to our table in clones of perfection.  I was allowed a taste of the crab cake and it was delicious.  Service was attentive and staff well trained.  Simply perfect.
would have liked more options as sides.  What you get is perfect prime rib and a baked potato.  Would have liked to have had the option of ordering perhaps a salad instead of the potato.  Baked potato was 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed. Good food, great atmosphere, and fast service! I would suggest this place!"}
{"text":"I love the quality of the meat here but I'm a little dissapointed in the tenderloin salad. I mean $17.00 for a salad and the greens barely qualify as a side salad. Greens are the cheapest part of the meal. I've been coming here a long time and have watched the continously shrinking salad."}
{"text":"We were shopping at the mall and did not want to eat at a fast food place. This is a hidden gem in a shopping mall! We went for lunch and both got sweet tea. My mom had to order a water instead because the tea was too sweet for her - I love sweet tea so I enjoyed it. Our waitress brought us bread and it was very yummy. It was tough to cut through with a knife but the inside was very soft. I got the pineapple chicken with mac and cheese and my mom got a burger with sweet potato fries. We were very pleased with both meals! I will definitely be back with my fiance. Two things I would love to try when we go back: Lobster spinach queso dip and the Southern Biscuit Burger."}
{"text":"The service was forgettable.  

Happy Hour is only in the bar so we had to get up from our table to walk to the bar and order our drinks.  Tried the old fashioned and thought it was disgusting.  Tried the cactus martini and didn't care for it either.  Had a long island iced tea and that was the best of the three.

Had the filet with blue cheese and mushrooms.  It was cooked perfectly and was so delicious!!  I wish there were more mushrooms but it was still yummy. 

Had the baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese and green onions.  It was so dry.  I took a few bites and didn't bother.

I payed for 3 drinks, pitched in for a bottle of wine for the table and my dinner.  No salad, no apps, no dessert.  It cost my $75 after tax and tip.  Not sure I will be back but a decent experience and delicious steak."}
{"text":"Not from the area, so I found this place via Yelp. I was not disappointed. The service, food, and atmosphere was excellent.

I sat up at the bar and wasn't sure what to order. The bartended was kind enough to explain what were some popular dishes, as well as her favorites. I went with the delmonico, accompanied by a caesar salad. There was also a decent selection of beer.

I was excited to hear they are considering opening one where I live, but if not I will be happy to return to this location!"}
{"text":"They have a separate gluten-free menu, so be sure to ask for it.  The food and service were excellent.  I wasn't able to partake in the pre-meal bread offering, but it didn't matter because my meal was big and fabulous!  I had the prime rib and baked potato and was provided with all of the fixings (au jus, horseradish sauce, cheese, real bacon bits, sour cream, etc.).  The food was very tasty and was just as good as any gluten-filled meal.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for gluten-free dining out."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 4 at 7:30pm, even though we got there 13 minutes before it and the place was crowded they got us a table in 3 minutes which was awesome.
We were 4, my in laws, my husband and I. The whole experience was different from my last one.
The service was excellent our glasses were always being refilled, the table was cleaned and not only our waitress checked on us many times but one of the managers too.
We had the ranch rings as appetizer, which is to die for. This is my favorite dish on their menu. Even my husband and his mom that don't eat onions this is the only kind that they do and love.
The onion rings are so crispy and delicious and the ranch is out of this world, simple amazing.
My husband and my father in law chose the Smokehouse Burger, my mother in law went with the French Dip and I picked the Center Cut Sirloin with the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes and I also had soup of the day the was Beef Vegetable Barley.
My soup was really good, just on point to a cold day.
The Smokehouse Burgers were cooked to perfection, this is my husband favorite dish. I really love they way it looks when it's platted I am just more a Steak lover kind of person so maybe one day I will order a Smokehouse Burger to myself.
This is the first time the my father in law had a Burger at Firebirds and he really enjoyed it, he kept saying how great his food was.
My mother in law also enjoyed her food, was the biggest French Dip that I even seen, and if she says a French Dip is good you. Enter believe her because it is one of her favorite things to eat.
My Steak was better than the first time I went to Firebirds. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the spicy gave it a special flavor.
I REALLY wanted to try their desserts but we all were so full that unfortunately we could not eat it.
In the first 10 minutes we had our drinks, appetizer and bread. Our food took 40 minutes to get done but as I said the place was packed, they had multiple parties with 6 or more, which impressed me since it was a Wednesday night and not weekend or holiday.
Overall the food was good, the service excellent and we will definitely be back specially because I can't stop thinking about that warm chocolate brownie.
After our bad experience in Durham their Regional Manager contact me to apologize and sent me VIP cards to visit any location in North Carolina, even though on my review I said that I would give a chance to one of their restaurants in Charlotte to check the difference between locations.
When I gave the cards to the waitress she called one of the managers, Ian his name, and he came to check on us and to know what happened in Durham and to confirm if we had a great experience last night. 
I can assure you that YES, we had a great experience I've decided to give another try to the restaurant in Durham next time I am up there.
Firebirds has the best customer service that I've ever seen in a restaurant and I wish other places cared about their customers like them."}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight. Went there after our first choice for dinner was a bust, lesson learned. For drinks the Double Diamond was a no brainer it was excellent!! Salads were a big hit, Deviled eggs were amazing! Worth a visit for sure. We'll be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with a knowledgeable and friendly waiting staff.  
   My steak was perfect,  and when my friend had a small issue with his, the manager happily took care of the issue.
     Great service, great atmosphere, and great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Needed a place for NYE, and called the day before and got a 6:45 PM for 2 reservation.  We got there and the receptionist was very personable despite the ton of people in the restaurant.  We only waited about 10 minutes and we were sat.  The waiter was great, the food was great as well.  The team approach is awesome and we never went without at all.  Thanks for making a great NYE for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Second time. And last time. That I come to. firebirds i stop by with my girlfriend on Friday it was kinda busy so we wait to get. A table understandable  butThe attitude of he. Employees working thereis he worst. So we sat. And I wanted to have a good night  so decided to forget about the arrogant hostess. And. We order appetizers Ahi tuna. And lobster queso. Tuna was dry and flavorless  the lobster queso. Was ok. Nothing out. Of the ordinary the kind. You can find if. U pay less and. Buy it at Costco   After. This and a bottle of wine we order our entrees took hem at least 40 min to bring. My steak which I order red  and gf. Got a Caesar salad to be onThe safe side  and. It. Was ok for sure is not a homemade dressing but she was content  about  my steak I order it. Red. After almost 40 min. It came medium rare. More. On the medium side. Well. By this time I didn't want to complaint  but I won't ever be back and support those arrogant people. I work in restaurants since. I am 16 years believe me this. Place. Is not worth your money"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The food was fairly institutional. Not hard to find better but the location is convenient."}
{"text":"PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE GRATUITY CALCULATIONS!!!  The service was great! Our waitress was awesome and personable (Bree) and (who I assume was) the Manager was really accommodating when they messed up our order and it took quite a bit of extra time to re-make it (they totally burned our order and tried to send it out). The minimal rating in stars really comes from the very end of our experience. I reiterate: PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE GRATUITY CALCULATIONS!!! The gratuity guide calculations provided on the receipt are grossly inflated. Our dinner was around $75; however, when going to leave the tip, I realized my standard 20-22% I leave did not match up to the amounts they had listed. I'm glad we caught this, as I (as well as most people, I assume) tend to follow the gratuity calculation guide. Sneaky sneaky Firebirds. CBS news picked up a similar story not too long ago, for a different restaurant (Cheesecake Factory) and blasted them for it. There is actually a class-action lawsuit over it. The lack of honesty with this business practice is advantageous and disappointing... and has serious detrimental repercussions."}
{"text":"This is a review for their catering service. I recently ordered service for the past Christmas holiday for a small group of 10-15 people. I ordered the ribs which came out FANTASTIC and the pineapple chicken which was overly dry and tasteless except for the overpowering taste charred grill. Ribs paired well with homemade fixings of salads and sweet potato mash. 

For the chicken, I don't get it why anyone would want chicken that tastes like that. I may as well lick the grill. Even the pineapple dressing on the side couldn't hide that cigarette flavor. 

Four stars for the manager who was reliable and quick with the getting the order prepared and for the staff getting the items ready on time. Ample serving ware and napkins were also provided."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was outstanding,  a bit pricey but completely worth the cost."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. It was not worth the money we paid for it. My husband had the meatloaf and parmesan mashed potatoes and said it was similar to cafeteria food...Hometown Buffet. I ordered a ribeye cooked medium and a loaded baked potato and it was cooked medium/well (closer to well done). It was tough, overcooked and a poor quality meat for a steakhouse.  I could have gone to Carraba's and got a much better steak."}
{"text":"Came in with my family(party of 9) for my birthday dinner. Service was great. Waitresses were attentive the entire night. Everyone enjoyed their meals. No complaints that I heard. Thanks for helping make my birthday experience a great one!"}
{"text":"We have found that the bar is an excellent place to share a burger or other 'quick bite' meal free of any young children that seem to pepper the dining room no matter the date or time we go...but last week we decided to split a prime rib and since we'd already settled into a table at the bar, had that served in that area as well. 

The level of service was as excellent as at a table, perhaps even more so as we were the 'odd ducks' with others mostly having apps and the waiter was attentive without hovering. 

Our meal was done to perfection! I like a rare prime rib, this was perfectly rare and SO flavorful!  The Colorado russet was true perfection--the salted skin gives such a bright flavor to the tender, silky interior and they use actual butter...not 'stuff' on the potato. 

We had opted for dessert and ended up having it be the flat point...but that was not necessarily the fault of Firebirds. They have a flourless chocolate cake, which we love generally anywhere we select it, but this one came out covered in strawberries and some sort of glaze. My husband detests strawberries and so it was a no go for him. I do wish that they indicated 'with berries' or at least asked if you wanted them before smothering the dessert in them. 

Overall, we have really enjoyed our twice monthly date nights at Firebirds...it's the perfect place for lovebirds and empty nesters...but for the love of all that is holy...leave the fledgelings at home so others can enjoy their night out!"}
{"text":"I've been here before but it's been a year or two since I've eaten here. My mom and I decided to come in pre-movie for dinner after work. The staff seemed very young and unsure. The hostesses, waitress, and the manager all seemed like this was their first time working in a restaurant. They weren't bad by any means but I weirdly felt like I was eating surrounded by high schoolers. 

Anyways I got my usual sesame crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and pecan green beans. My mom got the meatloaf with the same sides I got. We waited for awhile, probably a good 20 minutes, when one of the managers came over. She seemed very nervous and told me that our food was taking longer than usual because they burnt my salmon. They said they'd like to give us a free dessert as a result. When the food finally came out it was good, not great. I definitely don't think the high prices reflect the quality.

Even though I felt like I was in a high school work study it's still a decent place to get dinner on occasion. I give them three stars because when compared with other places in the same price point they fall a bit short."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Each time, my prime rib has been great. Service was good. The restaurant itself is simply a nice atmosphere, and a nice place to sit and eat. I enjoyed myself and the food each time."}
{"text":"I through a surprise birthday dinner here for my girlfriend, about a party of 12. Our servers were great and very attentive. They have big menu with a lot of options and the food was good. Everyone was happy with their meal. Upscale dining with very fair prices."}
{"text":"I just started posting on Yelp and would have given 5 stars every other time I have been here. It was my birthday today and I could have gone anywhere but this is the restaurant where I have come to for my last five birthdays. It is like a tradition for me now. Todays experience will hopefully be chalked up to being a new server or maybe he was justing having an off day. My girlfriend said that she thought our server had an attitude when she asked if the teas were fresh brewed or if they came out of a machine. His answer was that he didn't brew it but he was sure it was not sitting there from the night before. I wasn't looking at him and just thought he was showing some personality. She said he rolled his eyes and gave her a look like she was stupid. When time came to order, he asked for my order first and then took her order. I thought that was strange because a lady is usually asked for her order first. She ordered the chicken pasta with no tomatoes and onions (her favorite and go to order) and that is when I saw him roll his eyes like it was a nuisance that she ordered it that way. I ordered my food and he seemed fine. Our food came to the table, I was served first and he dropped her plate from 2 to 3 inches from the top of the table. I also thought that strange because usually a runner brings the food. Not only did she not get served first but his attitude was now in full jerk mode. I tried to make light of a bad situation and asked her if maybe this was one of her ex-boyfriends. Needless to say, she didn't think it was that funny. Guess what? Her chicken pasta had tomatoes and green onions. I waved down our server, he came over and just looked at her with a \"WHAT NOW\" look on his face. She told him that she ordered her pasta with no tomatoes or onions and he said that she did not. Basically calling her a liar. At this point, I was getting a little angry. I just told him never mind, asked her not to make a scene and just pick around the tomatoes and onions. We next saw him when he dropped off the bill. I paid the bill because I wanted no further interaction between the two. I left a penny as a tip and hope that he got my point. I still love Firebirds but I will not be able to come here as much because my girlfriend refuses to come here ever again. By the way, my food was awesome. Don't know about hers because she refused to touch it. On my birthday, next year, the only way I can keep the tradition alive is by sneaking here for lunch or breaking up with her and hoping the new lady in my life will bring me here."}
{"text":"I am disappoint.  

When the original Firebirds opened in Stonecrest, many moons ago, it was my favorite restaurant in Charlotte to go to.  Tender, juicy beef and well prepared sides.  The SouthPark location is either an anomaly in an otherwise fine restaurant group, or Firebirds has fallen into chain complacency and just isn't trying anymore.

On a rainy Tuesday, a little ahead of the dinner rush (if there even was a rush, there were plenty of tables available when we left at 8:00), I was eagerly anticipating a juicy piece of prime rib with a loaded baked potato that I had been dreaming of since we named the date for our monthly dinner outing.  Imagine my sadness when I was told by a manager that the whoozle-what in the oven kerplopped and the prime rib was a dried out mess (he explained what happened, but after I got the gist that I wasn't getting the dinner I wanted, I tuned him out).  He said he would return after getting my re-order, but never did.

The food:
Complimentary bread with butter:  Delightful.  Crunchy exterior, soft interior, delicious with a chunk of butter.
14 oz ribeye ($26) - (instead of the prime rib that I wanted) - Firebirds and Outback must share a meat delivery - mediocre piece of meat that was on the other side of the medium that I ordered, and dry.  The portion that would have been up against the bone was the tastiest portion, the rest was just meh and a little chewy.  The loaded baked potato that was served with it was barely warm enough to melt the butter.  And the entree came moments after I did the re-order, along with my date's medium-well filet - are you pre-cooking the meat?  How did it get done so quickly?
Big Daddy Chocolate Cake ($7.25) - more like Shrimpy Weirdo Cousin Stu's cake.  Aside from the raspberry sauce it was served with, you could get the exact same cake right now at any grocery store bakery section.  Moist to the point of squishy, not good.  When 2 gals (at least one of which has the PMS) who love to eat don't finish a piece of chocolate cake, there is something wrong.

Service was fine, he kept up with my refills for the most part.  Parking is a joke - condo only, 30 minute, 15 minute, only a certain tenant, only between 9 and 5 or some such crap - I shouldn't have to stop and read the writing in a space, I should just be able to park.  Valet parking is also available though, which I noticed when I was walking in.

Total for dinner (1 ribeye, 1 filet, 1 cocktail, 1 soft drink, 1 piece of chocolate cake) was $82 before tip and it was absolutely not worth it.  I have no problem paying for what a meal is worth and this did not hit the mark.  Not at all.  I won't be returning to this location, and with all the restaurants in my fine city now, I may have to break up with Firebirds completely if this is the quality that is now the standard."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the atmosphere and the wonderful smell when we walked in! We both had fish entrées and they were delicious. Our server was very sweet and we were happy with the timing of the food. I would definitely recommend this place everything we put in our mouth was amazing!"}
{"text":"Kobe beef meatloaf was outstanding. Great atmosphere, food and service. Parking was horrible but well worth the walk. Started at the bar before dinner - staff was very attentive.  All in all a very nice experience."}
{"text":"This was my 1st experience at any Firebirds.  The food was pretty good.  What was not good was the service.  My dining partner made a request that apparently he makes as a regular every visit.  His food was presented & he requested the server said it back because his order was incorrect.  She went straight to the mgr who did bring him a fresh order as he requested.  She was rude for the rest of our visit.  Firebirds represented any upscale chain dining experience & I would equate it to a Flemings."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch, just to see if our first experience was a fluke or not. Unfortunately, it was NOT! Ordered the burger, and the waitress asked if I wanted it done \"well or medium well.\" I said NEITHER. I want it MEDIUM. She said they don't do that! WTF? So you serve trichanosis beef??? Sure enough, it came back DRY. Well done. What a freakin' shock! This is supposed to be a fine dining establishment. When McDonalds serves better burgers for less than half the price, then this is NOT the place to come. We will NEVER come back here again. In my game, TWO strikes and you're OUT!"}
{"text":"We met friends for dinner.  Had a great table.  Cocktails were excellent and dinner was outstanding.  I had the 7oz filet topped with blue cheese and mushrooms. My wife had the filet with shrimp and agreed it was delicious.  Bottom line, the restaurant offers a great menu and atmosphere!  We have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly and prompt. The food was good. We came in late on a week day night after the normal dinner rush time for non weekends and had no trouble getting seated. The drink elderflower and basil tasted like it had grapefruit in it with out the sourness. I am not sure if that was the elderflower flavor or not, but o found the flavor profile of the drink interesting. Next time I will totally try a different seasonal drink they are featuring.
It seemed like a low lighting romantic type atmosphere.

The food was tasted. I gut fruit as a side and was happy not to find any mushy grapes. You would be surprised how often that happens if you try to do a healthier choices.

Over all, the place was great. It seems most the negative reviews were over the place being packed on the weekends. I think these people don't understand with two movie theaters, a mall, and a baseball training camp, this is a very busy area and only the restaurants you don't want to eat at normally are the ones with out a wait."}
{"text":"Called early Saturday morning and attempted to make a reservation at 7:00.  They were full and she said they could seat us by 7:15 so we moved it up 15 minutes.  The hostess also asked me if we were celebrating anything this evening and I told her 39 years of marriage!  She said wonderful and would alert our server!  She also stated we will try to make your evening memorable!  Great we are off to a good start!

We arrived at 7:10 and checked in.  There were people waiting everywhere, outdoors, on the patio, in the rocks out front, in the bar, waiting room, etc. We were promptly told that they were running 10 to 15 minutes behind schedule.  No biggie as things happen.  30 minutes later we checked with the hostess and we were informed that there were still 3 parties in front of us.  15 minutes later we were seated (7:55 p.m.) a full 40 minutes after our reservation.  How nice it would have been to have the hostess tell us \"thank you for waiting or thank you for your patience\".  Nothing, just \"this way please\".  We waited for another 10 minutes for a cocktail waitress to visit our table.  It was now 8:05 and we were very hungry so we asked the women to send our waitress to our table with menus.   When our waitress arrived, she was laughing and stated that she had had quite a night with a \"prime rib disaster\" they had experienced.  My poor husband just looked at me as that was what he was looking forward to ordering.  Again, she never said \"thank you so much for waiting\", or attempted to explain what she meant  or give any details to the prime rib disaster she mentioned.  We received our menus and another 10 minutes passed.  We flagged down the cocktail waitress and asked to send her to send our waitress to our table.  She came by and took our order.  We promptly received our delicious bread and for the next 25 minutes we completely consumed it.  Finally about 8:55 our food arrived.  By now we are just trying to make a bad evening good.  

We were very pleasantly surprised by our food (the only good spot in the evening and the reason for the 3 stars)  I ordered a filet mignon, which was probably the best filet I have had in 2 decades!  The baked potato was also a delight.  My husband did not have enough faith in the restaurant to order the prime rib so he ordered a steak and garlic mashed potatoes.  Also cooked to perfection.   The wine I ordered had tasted as if it had been sitting around for a while.  

When our waitress brought the dessert menu, my husband asked if they had anything special.  Our waitress asked why and he explained that it was our 39th.  She acted like it was the first she heard about it.  She said she would ask and see what she could do.   Of course by now you could probably write the script.  She took another 10-15 minutes to get back to our table and asked if we were ready to order.  Clearly she had forgotten our last conversation.  By now my husband finally said how disappointed he was in our experience.  She listened patiently and said she would send over the manager to talk to us.  Yep, you guessed it another 10 minutes and nothing.  5 minutes later she brought our check and said the manager discounted our order.  

It is so sad to see a fine restaurant so poorly managed.  The hostesses need to be better trained as well as the wait staff.  We sat there and thought of several ideas for them.  When we were seated, they could have said they were offering discounts on wine and beer or something.  Anything just throw us a bone!   Honestly it would have been wonderful to get the manager's side of the story.  The food though was excellent.  We left at 9:55, over 2.5 hours after our arrival.  Not sure if the food is worth the mismanagement."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant ! Everything is wonderful, the food, drinks and service. When I graduated from ASU my husband threw me a party there and it was one of the best nights ever .  They took such good care of us and our guest with every detail ."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger,just a plain burger(tomato lettuce well done meat)..I was very disappointed! It was one of the most tasteless burgers I ever had! I was hoping for some great flavor,and got nothing,plus there fries are not so good! Paid 11$,would rather have gone to five guys! Will come back to try other food but never a burger.. At least the service was good!"}
{"text":"Love Firebirds. I each at this location several time a month and they always serve the best quality food paired with just the right glass of wine.

The staff is very friendly and their pricing is spot on. I always feel I have gotten what I paid for."}
{"text":"Thank You Bianka M for recommending Firebirds Wood Fired Grill for weekend Happy Hour.

Rare to find a place that even offers an upscale Happy Hour during the weekends.

Bar area very inviting with all the liquor bottles stacked and displayed with colorful hues from the background lighting that makes it inviting and appealing to order drinks.

The Jalapeno Deviled Eggs were delicious. Watch out for that piece of jalapeno for it can get really hot under the collar.

Beef Slider buns at the bottom were bit burnt and kind of tough to chew.

The Crispy Mahi Tacos was good but the sauce was a tad too much for me. 

Extensive list for wine selection be prepared to be charged for 5 ounce or 8 ounce size for a glass of wine.

Great place to meet up with friends, colleagues, and family over Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar both times I was here! Excellent personable service both times! Tried both the rib eye and filet mignon. Both were excellent and cooked to requested temp. The filet was by far one of the best I've ever had. Sides were also great both times! If I lived here I would definitely be a regular (which by sitting at the bar I realized they have a lot of regulars which is always a good sign in my book). Give it a shot if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  Lunch is kind of expensive, even for a place like this.  $11 for a salad that was good, but not eleven dollars good.  It's a  chain that tries to be somewhat upscale but it doesn't work.  If I'm going to go an upscale place, Firebird's would be low on the list.  It's in \"South Park:, so there were a lot of older rich people, so I guess it's a good locale."}
{"text":"Ate at Firebirds in Brentwood, TN and Chandler, AZ over the past month. Food is great! Prices are reasonable for the portions you receive. The menu has a great variety of options. Service is also good. 

Atmosphere is a bit noisy but sitting towards the back corner helped. The bread is delicious and they bring as much as you would like. I had the salmon which was delicious and perfectly cooked. 

I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because we had ordered a steak medium and it came back well done. I'm not sure if they thought we wouldn't notice it because it had been smothered in blue cheese sauce and mushrooms but it was clearly over done for medium. The manager was nice and comped that meal, which we didn't expect but appreciated."}
{"text":"Their onion rings are so good. The lobster dip is delicious also. I've tried the mixed greens salad with steak which is nice and fresh. The pepper encrusted sirloin is good."}
{"text":"Living a short skip away from the Stonecrest Firebirds, I have been a frequent diner for many, many years.  Many dates, celebrations, gab fests, Secret Lunch Club meetings and \"I can't believe he did that, what a jerk\" meals, drinks and desserts have taken place at this very restaurant.  I LOVE the Firebirds.  And as with all relationships, great days are easy to weather, it's the fights that test the love.  

Today, me and the Firebirds had our first disagreement.

Firebirds is easy to find within the Stonecrest Shopping Center.  Parking is ample and well lit, and it's a short walking distance from the Regal Cinema if you are doing dinner and a movie.

I typically eat dinner here and usually have either the prime rib or the filet, which have always been cooked to perfection and delicious.  Firebirds is a few dollars more than your typical chain steak joints, but your intestinal tract will thank you for spending the few extra dollars by not seizing up from the tenderizers and other chemicals that other places use to make bad cuts of meat taste better.  The BLT salad is delicious.  The 'butt bread'  (delicious warm bread served with butter that looks like a booty) is warm, soft and good.  The onion rings are thick cut onions coated in a seasoned panko crust and served with ranch - YUM!  I don't care for seafood, but my friends swear by the Lobster Queso dip.  Treat yourself and get the loaded baked potato which tastes fresh and not like it has been withering in a steam bath for hours, and is topped with butter, sour cream, cheese, BACON and green onions.  My parents love their crab cake salad.  Spiced green beans with pecans are good, sweet potato waffle fries and steak fries are well done too.  Many years ago they had a pork chop with herbed butter special that I still daydream of.   Big Daddy Chocolate Cake is huge and rich, creme brulee cheesecake is AMAZING creamy goodness and the brownie sundae is yum.  I have never had a bad meal or item here - ever.

Until today.

I took my mom and dad to lunch for my mom's birthday.  Firebirds'  fall lunch specials are a crab cake sandwich and a chicken fried steak.  Both of the parentals got the crab cake sandwich, one with a side of the sweet potato waffle fries and the other with steak fries.  I got the chicken fried steak w/ the gravy on the side, served with the spicy green beans w/ pecans and poblano cheddar mashed potatoes.  I said I wanted the gravy on the side to our waitress twice to make sure that they gravy was indeed served ON THE SIDE.  (you see where this is going, right?)  So the food comes to the table with the gravy on the steak, but whatever, I'll try to eat it.  Normally I am a big fan of gravy, but this was a brown peppercorn gravy and the peppercorn flavor was overwhelming to me, I couldn't even taste the meat (some folks may like it, but I did not).  I looked for our waitress and another young woman came to the table and asked if she could help.  I explained, she took the plate away and returned a moment later to let me know the food was coming right back.  Our original waitress then came over and said she didn't know I wanted it without the gravy (she may not have heard me say it twice) and said it would be out momentarily.  The manager then came over and said it was coming right up.  All very friendly, not pushy or accusatory as if it were my fault.   It was no big, stuff happens.  Mom and dad were happy with their crab cake sammiches and that is the most important thing to me.  Meat came back with no gravy on it, poblano mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and the green beans were cooked well, not terribly spicy and the pecans gave them an interesting crunch.  I ate it all, life was good.

When the check came, they had taken my chicken fried steak off of the bill, which I ate ALL of on the second try, so they didn't have to do that. I told the waitress that I ate it, so it didn't need to be removed, and she just said it was taken care of.  It's excellent customer service and the immediate correction of a disappointing dish that will keep me coming back to Firebirds for years.  Consistently good food and service have made me a loyal customer.  

If only I could find a boyfriend that was so delicious and always treated me as if I were right..."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and never had a bad meal. The bread is always warm and delicious, the ribs fall off the bone, onion rings are great and they even have deep fried spinach as a side."}
{"text":"I've been to Firebirds before but during restaurant week in the past. I wanted to submit an honest review when it's not the most hectic of times and I'm definitely glad I did. Of course like most popular restaurants there was a little wait. #WorthTheWait

They brought waters out for both of us while I started with a mixed drink called the Mango Mojito. Absolutely amazing. The alcohol was mixed so well that you couldn't even tell it was in it. Thought about getting two, but I was driving.

For my appetizer I tried the smoked Chicken wings and they were delicious but then again it is somewhat difficult to find a place with bad chicken wings. There were about 8 of them, perfect appetizer size and I myself prefer almost everything spicy, the wings had enough kick in them to satisfy my heat cravings.

And for my main entrée I had the Pepper Crusted Sirloin, prepared medium well... absolutely amazing. They prepared my steak just the way I requested and the pepper seasoning made it an absolute delight to my taste buds. By far one of the BEST steaks I have ever eaten. A very highly recommended meal in my book.

The service was fast, and friendly. They had friendly smiles on their faces and answered our questions with knowledgeable responses and expertise. Overall I five this restaurant get a 5.0 out of 5.0. They will definitely be seeing me again."}
{"text":"Always a good experience.   Food is always A+


Chris the manager makes sure you have a great experience. 


Friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"I attended the soft opening of Firebirds, this past weekend and I was not disappointed.  I had visited the Erie, PA location a few years ago, and enjoyed my meal, and therefore very excited that a location would be opening in the Cleveland area.  My friend and I arrived on time for our 7:30 reservation and we were immediately seated and approached by our server.  I ordered a white sangria, which was pretty tasty.  We each ordered salads.  I ordered the mixed salad which was fresh and perfectly dressed.  There was also complimentary warm bread and butter which was tasty.  I ordered the prime rib (cooked medium well), for my entrée, with loaded baked potato.  The prime rib was little more pink than I would have liked, a bit salty and the texture was just a little bit mushy, but it was still good, especially for a soft opening.  My friend and I ordered the brulee cheesecake for dessert and it was EXCELLENT, nicely portioned, for sharing, creamy and perfectly bruleed.  I was pretty impressed with the service, food and ambiance.  I rated 4 stars due to this being a soft opening, knowing that once the restaurant is up and running, I'll absolutely return, and update with a 5 star review."}
{"text":"This was my first time dinning at Firebirds and I was really impressed, despite the mediocre service. The ambiance was warm and cozy and they have an excellent lounge and bar area with a large fireplace. We started with the lobster dip which was delicious. I had the bacon wrapped filet which again was delicious, and my husband salivates just thinking about the steak salad. Great location and overall excellent dinning experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I begged & bribed his family to come here instead of the normal steakhouse they go to for birthdays. We love the Arrowhead location, and expected this location to be up to standard. 

   Service was good. Other than the table not being completely prebussed/crumbed, no major complaints. Our drinks were always full and food came in a timely manner. 

  All 5 of our filet mignon were underdone. The medium rare steaks came out rare, and my medium steak came out medium rare. We aren't sending back 5 steaks. Ive been in the industry for 9 years, I'd rather eat an underdone steak than send it back. 

  I start to get into my steak, and I realize that it is unbelievably charred, which I normally don't mind. Im pretty used to eating burned food, considering my cooking skills. The char is so bad that I can't taste the steak at all. I am pretty sure there was no salt put on the steak before it was cooked.

  The steak had me puzzled. About 5 bites in I realize that it isn't filet mignon. My suspicion is validated when I steal a bite of my boyfriends steak. Everyone else's filet is wrapped in bacon, mine is not. 

  I had to be at work later that day, and was already short on time. I did not have the option to wait for another steak to be cooked. Also did not want to cause a scene in front of my boyfriends parents. As someone who will do whatever possible to avoid sending anything back, I would have sent back this steak if I had the time to. 

  Also, several of the Au Gratin potatoes in the mix were still raw. Super unpleasant to be picking raw potatoes out of a mouth full of chewed food. Also super unpleasant to eat said raw potatoes.

  I don't eat fish, so I can't tell you how the ahi was.  (Ahi? Mahi? Not even sure if I'm saying it right) However, I overheard my boyfriends dad saying he liked the salad better than the fish. No ahi went uneaten though!

  The creme brulee cheesecake is great as always. Having worked at several bars/restaurants, I did find it odd that they did not have one of the desserts comp'ed for a birthday. 

  When presented the bill, I noticed that I was charged for the 9oz filet that I ordered but instead got something of lower quality and price. My boyfriend was super pissed, and told me to tell our server to charge me for what I was given (probably a sirloin, no salt/pepper, extra char lol). I could tell it caught our server off guard since everything seemed fine. She ended up comping the entire steak. Which was cool of her, because even though I do like sirloin nornally, this steak was SO bad. 

  Overall, service was great, food was terrible. I would not go back here. It was kind of embarrassing since we talked up the place so much. The whole time I was wishing they came to our side of town and had dinner at \"our\" firebirds (Arrowhead)"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"amazing food, amazing staff, amazing wine... want for a date and had a hell of a time!!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Dinner was really delicious and dessert..... Was to die for!!!! This was the perfect place to have a date wig my husband away from our home in CA."}
{"text":"Loaded with son, daughter-in-law, wife and two grandchildren we are frequent diners at Firebirds.  Given the children we come early, prior to 6pm and have no problem getting seated immediately.  We leave after dinner moving through the crowd in front waiting for a table.

Service is great.  Kid menu is better than average and they will get the children's meals ready quickly.  Helps keep them quiet and happy.

Portions are wonderful.  Food is well prepared and excellent.

On one occasion I ordered the prime rib which came over cooked.  I can handle medium rare to medium, but not more or less.  This truly beautiful piece of meat came in rare enough to quiver. I hated to ask them to cook it more, as I knew that it would come back too done.  So it was, but I ate it and appreciated that they did re-cook it.  When the bill came, they comp-ted my meal.  I talked to the manager telling him that I wanted to pay for it as it was excellent and that I did not want to see a good piece of meat thrown out.  He insisted that the meal was on the house.  Unnecessary as far as I am concerned, but  that is the culture and policy of Firebird.

Their BLT salad is worth being a meal, and sometimes my son and I do just that.  The portion is generous and if you order it with your main course you will not finish your main.  Suggest you split the BLT salad with someone.  But baby, it is really a yumilicious treat.

Baked potatoes come with lots of toppings. But be aware that the spuds are rolled in heavy salt while baking and though I love the skins I just can't take the salt, even if I wipe it off.  But the potatoes are great.

We have not had a bad meal and have really worked through the menu so can confidently tell you to order what you want as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend.  I had a BLT salad and she had ribs.  Wonderful meal!!! Flavor in every bite of salad.  The bread was fresh out the kitchen and hot and steamy.  My friend loved her ribs. I ate her coke slaw and it had a nice fresh almost fruity tang.  Excellent service from our waiter, he kept our glasses filled.  Beautiful setting. Manager visited all tables. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight with a an older regular from my work. No strange looks or snickering from what I could see. We shared the ribs and chili crusted delmoncio. Fantastic!  Everything was great, from the drinks, bread, and to the steak. My full rack of ribs fell off of the bone. The scalloped potatoes had the nicest kick to them. Jen had me sample the double black diamond martini. Sold! Not very often do you have someone offer a shareable sample of a martini. It was delicious.  I love the fact that all the cocktail juices are made fresh right in front of you. They have all the fresh fruit/spices to make anything you can imagine. Our bartender made my friend his strange crown royal milkshake without a blink. I liked the fact that she shared the last bit that wouldnt fit into his glass, with the girls next to us. He loves doing random acts of kindness and I know that he liked that. I checked out the happy hour menu. $5 for all their premium martinis and handcrafted cocktails?! Unheard of. You really cant beat that. I will be back soon. This is my new favortie steak/bbq/fancy cocktail place. Thank you for taking care of us Jen!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was awesome!!

Ok, so I went in there with low expectations.  Having heard from friends it was just ok, then reading the reviews here on yelp....

I was so pleasantly suprised!  Yay!

Lets see
For an appetizer we got the lobster queso spinach dip.  It was heavenly.  Mmmmm, melty cheese and lobster... mmm......

I got the Prime Rib with au gratin potatoes and port mushrooms.
The potatoes were gooey and spicy!
The mushrooms were soooooooooooooooo good, andI could definitely taste the port

For dessert I had the creme brulee cheesecake
OMG
SOOO GOOD!

So yeah, I was very excited that the food turned out to be so good.  I'd love to go back."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week, because we look forward to the Queen's Feast like some wait for Christmas. The cilantro lime viniagrette is so refreshing on the greens salad. The chili rubbed salmon on mashed potatoes was wonderful, just enough kick to not be too spicy, as I'm a huge wimp. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because of the desserts, I tried both the creme brulee cheesecake and key lime pie. 
Maybe they should do a complimentary glass of wine instead? Just an idea!"}
{"text":"I can't say I've ever left dissatisfied from Firebirds. They've got some pretty delicious food. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn they have Four Peaks Hop Knot on draft. The burgers are tasty; I've had those a few times. All the appetizers I've ever tried were good. And, the BLT Salad is phenomenal--a must try. They even give you fresh-baked bread while you wait for your meal. The staff is friendly and professional. The decor is nice, with a rich, dark interior. The patio is even better--especially during our mild months. Overall, I'm a fan. I'd recommend Firebirds to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is five stars. The service is five stars. The location is five stars. Everything about this Firebirds was awesome. At last minute I was calling around looking for a restaurant that was willing to cook for my party of 25. We are celebrating an engagement and wanted to celebrate somewhere nice in the Charlotte area. The location is outside of downtown and it happened to be a little further than what I wanted but they were willing to accommodate such a large party at the last minute. Great service as they were willing to take on the task of cooking for such a large group and the food was fantastic. The ambience was great as well. The prices aren't that bad as I would consider this fine dining.


**Please pardon my mistakes as I'm using Siri to dictate"}
{"text":"Visited on Wed. evening. I have never had a complaint about Firebirds it is my all time favorite steak house.  This Wed. was a different story.  Nothing huge but when you pay $100 for a meal you would like good service. When our food was brought to us the server (not uur waitress) basically tossed our food to us and took off. It was quite odd. she said \"Here is your food\" and took off. No Can I get you anything else, does everything look ok? She bolted out of there. We both looked at her after and thought maybe something happened to her as it was so odd. Nope she was just rushing back to talk to the cook and other servers...laughing away have a good ole time. OK that is fine but like I said do your job first. Ordered medium well filet butterflied and it came out  very pink throughout. They took it back and recooked. The other person I was with noticed hers was all pink in middle as well but was somewhat full so just kept her as is. She did mention to the manager when he came over that hers too was very pink. He said he looks just as it should. He was very rude with her and acted like she was in the wrong. The whole middle was pink? That is not medium well. Anyway not even the point the customer is always right, if not happy at least apologize and mean it. He offered to make her a new one in such a condescending tone. We just wanted to be done. Just not a pleasant evening at our fav. Disappointed BUT they did at the end take the steak off which was not our intent to begin with, we just told him truth when he asked how everything was. Do not ask if you don't want to know is my opinion. I will go back but will for sure being trying our Arrowhead grille or Flemings to see if the service is better."}
{"text":"On this visit my food was so awesome. My girlfriend ordered the coconut shrimp which was far better than red lobsters. I had the filet mignon it was tender, juicy with a hell of a flavor. Sides were amazing as well. We will be coming back"}
{"text":"Great patio!  You would never guess you're in a mall lot.   Delicious Double Blackdiamond Martini (pineapple infused vodka).  Wines were good.  Happy hour food offering selection just ok.  Split a chopped salad, which was good, and they split in the kitchen for us.  Prime rib, however, was overdone and a pretty big vein of grizzle to work around. Probably would not order that again.  Staff were friendly and very professional."}
{"text":"Overall, not really impressed. Yet another example of how service can ruin a dining experience.

Came here on Valentine's day with my boyfriend (we're a younger couple, but old enough to purchase alcohol). Immediately upon being seated, the server was terribly rude and standoffish presumably because he assumed we were younger than we looked and because we didn't immediately purchase alcohol. He made extremely snide remarks when he took our order, and was very short with us. What was even more frustrating was that we could see the difference in his demeanor towards us and towards the group that was sitting  at the table in front of us (that had a much larger tab). He didn't bother to check up on us during the entire meal service, and three different servers brought us drink refills. 

The food was decent. Compared to similar style restaurants, it really didn't blow any place out of the water. It was just very average. I got a burger cooked rare, and it came out just as I requested. Like I said, though: average. We left considerably upset. 

A few days later, I was still bothered by the incident. We decided to call the manager to inform him of the way his employee had treated us. As someone who has worked in the food industry before, I understand the importance of customer service and I figured the manager should know about the quality service his employees are exhibiting. The manager was very apologetic and professional about the situation, but to be honest, I'm not completely sure I would return. 

This could have been a three-star review for average food and professional management, but when your night gets tainted by terrible service, there isn't much room for negotiation (in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Kassie was wonderfully, she made the experience amazing. She recommended great drink choices and was very attentive. The quality of the food was terrible, I placed a Togo order that included a filet with a baked potato and the chicken pasta. The pasta was dry and the portion size seemed smaller than when we've dined in. The filet was entirely to fatty but the most offensive thing on that plat was the potato which was burnt. It was shocking to think that something so simple to make was served in such a manner, it was inedible."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my experience here.  You must try the coconut shrimp, it's one of the best things on the menu!  I also enjoy their fish dishes and the pecan green beans.  The portions are more than ample but not over the top.  They have a nice wine list, too.  My husband loves their prime rib and almost always orders it.
 
I also want to comment on service.  This is one place where I have had consistently great service.  The staff is always friendly and pleasant.  It's nice to have a place you feel you can count on.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests as the Firebirds chain is a bit more limited in locations, and it's more mainstream than some of our local upscale places.  Easy to please a crowd here, for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Our waiter was nice enough, just sparse in attention. Husband had salmon and potatoes and said it was good. I had a hamburger on lettuce with vegetables as I and gluten free.  Expensive for what it was. Ahh it's ok."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner.

Fantastic, as usual. Great atmosphere, food, and wine. Lena took  great care of us."}
{"text":"One certainty about this wildly popular lodge-like restaurant is that, unless you get there early, you will wait. Another is that it will be full. While most every other restaurant has been turned over at least once, including its current neighbor Cantina 1511, Firebirds is one of the area's few constants. It is such because it has constantly delivered excellent food along with attentive service. It's that simple. 

It's also hard to ignore as the aroma of its wood-fired grill seems to permeate the air of the entire Stonecrest Shopping Center parking lot. Once seated in its beautiful log cabin themed dining area, order anything, you can't go wrong; however, their specialty, of course, is anything grilled so that is the route I'm always gonna take here. 

I have ordered the American Kobe Meatloaf and enjoyed it.  At $19 though,  that's some expensive meatloaf. The wood-fired salmon is  also superb but a bit pricey at around $25. They offer a steakhouse-like lineup of beef cuts that mostly run from $25 to $35. You also can't go wrong with salads.

As you might be able to infer, this place is pricey because it can be. Considering that, they're just too many other restaurant options for me to be a regular here. If I'm going to spend a hundred bucks for meal I'd rather do so in a fine dining restaurant. Still, it's always a treat to go here and I recommend it."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite restaurants. Each time I have gone, the food and service has been great. Their bread is probably one of the best bread loaves I have ever had and I can make a meal out of that and that alone. Freshly baked and slightly doughy still, its magnificent. When I first started going to Firebirds, I would order the pork tenderloin with a sweet and sour glaze and the southwest au gratin potatoes. Sooooo good. Now its no longer on the menu   :(   Anyways, I have found a replacement in the grilled salmon with veggies and Parmesan mashed potatoes.I always ask for peach salsa on the side too to put on the fish. It is honestly one of the best salmon meals I have ever had at any restaurant and surprisingly, one of the healthiest items at Firebirds. I love that they list their nutrition facts on their website. Anyways, my husband loves the prime rib and loaded baked potato. He says that the prime rib is consistently good and flavored really well. Also, Firebirds has some awesome wings for appetizers and their tortilla slaw with coconut shrimp appetizer is to die for. The slaw is so different but very tasty. Oh and for dessert, their key lime pie and brownie sundae are pretty legit. There are only a couple of things that I have tried that I was not overly impressed with: Tortilla soup (creamier than I like and not much flavor), pecan crusted trout was kinda dry. 
The service at Firebirds has always been great. There was one time when my salmon was raw in the middle. The waitress took it away and continuously apologized. A manager came over and offered to give me any appetizer and as much bread as I wanted at no charge while I waited for my meal to be recooked. They also gave me dessert on the house. The managers as well as their staff genuinely care about the customers it seems which is something I haven't seen in a long time at other restaurants. Their prices are also decent. I personally thought the prices, service, and quality of food at Firebirds far surpassed The Keg.
My husband and I will definitely continue to come to this restaurant over places like the Keg and more upscale steakhouses!"}
{"text":"We always go here when in town with our friends because we LOVE the Double Diamond martinis, which is straight vodka which has been infused with fresh pineapple for two weeks. 
The prices here are bit high, I believe it was $23.00 for my tenderloin and veggie kabobs i ordered this last time, which were tasty, but had a pretty significant flaw. My friend and I both ordered the kabobs, she ordered hers Medium, I unfortunately had to order mine Medium Well because I'm expecting. When our food arrived the server said he had failed to track which plate was which. I was not highly impressed because I told him I was expecting and therefore needed mine to be MW when i ordered. The server said we should cut into our meat and we'd be able to figure it out which was which. It ended up that I had the Medium and my friend the Medium Well, however I not knowing what Medium Well looks like, because I usually get Medium Rare, had no idea. I didn't figure it out until the end of our meal when I looked over at my friends plate and realized she had uneaten cut into pieces of meat that were dark all the way through and and my pieces i had eaten were pink in the middle. She didn't enjoy her dinner, and I ate something that was not healthy for me. I suppose I should of asked the waiter for his opinion after I cut into my beef, but I really think he should have tracked, or marked our plates, since I had stressed the importance of not mixing up the two to begin with. 
I will go to Firebirds again with my friends on our next visit next year when I can actually drink the DD Martinis, but I also plan on saying something to the manager about their lack of tracking preparation."}
{"text":"Loved the coconut shrimp but they took them off the menu, or it would've been a 5 star review. If you get the firebird chicken pasta, beware of the heat. I had to ask them to make it less spicy and it is great.

Ranch rings are the new app I get now that the shrimps gone"}
{"text":"They are just so nice here! We came in about 30 minutes to closing and asked if it was going to be a bother for them to seat us. I was really surprised when the hostess cheerfully said it's no problem and whisked us to our table!

The food came out reasonably fast and hot, and drinks were kept filled. It was really nice to see such pleasant service near the end of closing when they are usually occupied with cleanup and leaving. The food was quite decent and typical of a steakhouse. Thanks for having us so late Firebirds!"}
{"text":"I don't get why people think this place is so wonderful. We tried it three separate times and now I'm done. The food is subpar at best it's along the lines of black angus and the service was even worse. We've done the Bly salad to steaks and all of it lacked flavor, poor presentation, and overpriced. The last time we went they had about 6 servers all standing around the back wall looking bored out of their minds. Even with all of them standing there it took forever to get refills on our water and tea. There are just so many better places to spend your money. I'm convinced winter visitors keep them in business."}
{"text":"This place is the rip off of all rip offs. My boyfriend and I decided to go there for lunch over the summer. We ordered drinks from the bar, ridiculously priced for a restaurant during the day, $9.50 for some mojitos? Come on. They weren't that good. 
Now we were starving when we arrived, I ordered the tilapia and asparagus and he order the meatloaf and potatoes. 
We received our food and he dug in right away. I just sat and looked at mine. 

\"Fourteen dollars for this? How much was yours, eleven dollars?\" 
My boyfriend looks at my plate and could only say, \"That's it?\" 

He received a FULL plate of meatloaf and the other half of mashed potatoes. I had six stalks of asparagus and a piece of fish the size of a child's hand. That was it. 

I called the waiter over and asked him if all the fish were this size and he said he thought so and there was nothing wrong with my meal. I asked him if this was worth $14 to him and he said he thought so. I told him, \"I'm not from Scottsdale, I would like to see the manager.\" 

The manager walks over and proceeds to actually argue with me about the food saying that it is perfectly fine. I said, \"It may be fine, it may taste great, but I'm still going to be hungry after this $14 meal. I would at least like another piece of fish.\" 
He tells me for $6 he could get me one more piece of fish and I tell him I'm not paying that for another piece this size. 

At this point my boyfriend is offering me his food, but that's not what I wanted. 

Finally I tell the manager just take it back, I'm sorry to see you toss that but you are doing nothing to satisfy this customer. He literally did nothing but argue with me. 

I wasn't trying to get a free meal, I just wanted to get what I was paying for. 

Rude people, overpriced food, crappy bar. 
Take your business somewhere else."}

{"text":"Love love. 

Happy hour is amazing. half priced drinks and the sangria is awesome. 

Ordered the steak tacos, pretzel and pigs in a blanket. Perfect spices, sauces and texture.

Food came out warm. 

Server was super friendly and even fixed our uneven table without us asking. 

Sat on the patio and the ambience is amazing. love the fireplace and the wood. all in all, yay yay yay."}
{"text":"We love this place!! We always take our visitors from out of state to this place, no matter how long the wait. (It can get realllly long, people. On at Saturday night at 8 they were telling people that the wait was over 3 hours.) 

We have never gotten anything we haven't enjoyed. We are big fans of their tempura shrimp, blt salad & their bread of course! 

I really enjoy the beef kabobs. They are always cooked to perfection. My husband likes their ribs, said they fell off the bone easily."}
{"text":"We come to Firebirds a couple of times a year and they never disappoint. The food is always good, service is excellent and we just feel at home there. 

Last night we invited friends to join us at the last minute. We updated our reservation via the website and we were shocked that we could still get 4 ppl in on a Friday night. We all sat at the bar while waiting in our table and received a text message shortly after. Love the use of technology guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent birthday celebration with friends.  The atmosphere was warm on a very cold night and the food and wine were great.  Thanks to Wriston for excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"Great, food&service,  first time at this restaurant & I was impressed! Had the French dip sandwich with a glass of wine, service was spot on, prices reasonable, parking is a challenge but on par for Saturday night. Server was very attentive & had our food on the table 15 mins. after ordering, when I'm on the west side I will visit this place again. At 6pm there was 15 people waiting to be seated so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"A little pricey to be in a shopping mall but the food was excellent. Interesting cocktails. Friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I ordered the Sesame Encrusted Salmon and it was the best thing I've had in a while! I could have done without the spinach as they were more on the fried side and I was expecting it to be sautéed. Spinach wasn't horrible but should have been an appetizer. My mother had the French Dip and she was more than pleased. The sweet potato waffle fries are a must have, and I don't even like sweet potatoes. Portions were plentiful with the exception of the Baby Back Ribs."}
{"text":"Brought our friend to try out this restaurant that we had been telling her was so good, and it did not meet our previous experiences and expectations. My steak was supposed to be medium well and it was really red. 
Bread is so good, salad is yummy, and baked loaded potato was delicious, but my center cut sirloin was undercooked. My friends was fine and my boyfriends was a ribeye that was cooked good. 
The biggest problem was service. We did a call ahead and were told 35 min when we got there it was only like a total of 15 min wait so that was awesome, since there was no one waiting anyways. It was an early 530 dinner on a Saturday. Once our food order was placed it took 45 min just to get us our food; so we stuffed up on bread while we waited. Just wishing service would've been better and I didn't have to continue to wait for my steak after already waiting for so long!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice place. Would go back again as the service was great. Nice place for dinner. A little in the loud side but not bad."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain steakhouse in Charlotte, but the Rae Rd location has better service, especially at the bar.  Excellent food, much better price than Sullivans, Ruth Chris, Chimas...  The house martinis are all good. The seared Ahi Tuna is a must, the chilli rubbed delmonico steak, Baked potato is salt rubbed ust right, mushrooms, and the creme brulee cheesecake for desert.  Make sure you call ahead or you will be waiting."}
{"text":"I've always liked Firebirds.  I love the atmosphere.  My bestfriend was visiting from Houston and we met her there.  The food and service was very good.  I didn't care for the lobster tail.  It had a strong fishy taste.  I always eat lobster tail from various places and it has never tasted like this.  Even when I have it fresh in California it doesn't have a fishy taste.  This is the first time I've ever gotten the lobster tail.  Other than that, I think it's a great place.  I will definitely go back, just won't order the lobster tail."}
{"text":"It had been nearly 10 years since last visiting Firebirds. Man, how did I forget about this place while continually settling on The Keg or Flemming's for great steak in the Chandler area? Consider that streak broken.

Went with my mom prior to a concert this week and Son, I was not disappoint. Service from waitstaff was prompt, professional and never \"hovering\". Mom had the peppercorn sirloin with the au poive sauce and raved about it. I had the center-cut sirloin, medium rare and it was outstanding. I almost did a double take on the thickness; it was approaching filet thickness and grilled to perfection. Spiced pecan green beans ($6) as an added side was worth every penny.

I'll definitely be back. If mom is a party to where to eat in the future, I think she will persuade others that Firebirds is a legitimate candidate for steak."}
{"text":"I enjoy a good steak, and had been told by several of my friends in AZ to check this place out when I visited AZ.  So glad, I was given the tip.  I thought I had reviewed Firebirds already in the past, but had not. (I have embedded some of my older pictures in this review, so they can be seen besides my recent pictures).

I am a huge fan of the specialty cocktails at this restaurant especially their signature drink, the Double Black Diamond Martini.  This is a fresh pineapple infused for 21 days with New Amsterdam Pineapple Vodka and garnished with a sweet pineapple slice.  OMG, if you like pineapple like me, this is your drink.  Refreshing and oh so good.  On a past visit, I was fascinated by the big, beautiful jar on the bar counter infusing the pineapple with the pineapple vodka.  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firebirds-wood-fired-grill-peoria?select=5pZbnbQBOhJYtZbux9lpXw  A complimentary loaf of fresh bread was brought to the table, also. 

This most recent visit, we took advantage of Arizona Restaurant week and ordered off that special week menu.  This was a three-course meal at the price of $33.  The meal consisted of choice of a first course of hummus, salad or soup, second course of choice of four entrees and third course of dessert choice.  All of us at the table ordered the same first course and entree off this menu of the BLT salad and Prime Rib.  The BLT salad is like a meal in itself. This side salad is quite large with bacon, tomatoes, chopped lettuce and ranch dressing.  The prime rib was cooked to order and delicious and flavorful and served with au jus and horseradish on the side.  Our entrees came with choice of side and we all had the Loaded Baked Potato.  I chose the Key Lime Pie as my dessert as this is a favorite dessert of mine and this did not disappoint.  It was light, sweet and tart at the same time and so very good.  Firebirds' regular menu consists of not only many great choices of steak and prime rib, but salads, seafood, chicken, burgers, pasta.  There is something for everyone. We have ordered a ribeye and NY strip steak in the past here and these have been very good. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firebirds-wood-fired-grill-peoria?select=y-eZlASDDBjCScVMHvN4kQ 

Service here is always outstanding.  Friendly, helpful and very attentive.  I like the fact that the wait staff and management here always asks if you are enjoying your meal here.   I know we will always have a great meal at Firebirds, so when visiting AZ, this is a frequent stop for dining when we are vacationing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain steakhouse in Charlotte.  Excellent food, much better price than Sullivans, Ruth Chris, Chimas...  The house martinis are all good. The seared Ahi Tuna is a must, the chilli rubbed delmonico steak, Baked potato is salt rubbed ust right, mushrooms, and the creme brulee cheesecake for desert.  Make sure you call ahead or you will be waiting.  BTW, the one on Rae Rd is better than the one in South Park."}
{"text":"Food and service was great! The dishes were a little expensive. Check the menu before going. Great for out-of-towners trying to avoid chains. Unless this is a chain and they just don't have them in Dallas."}
{"text":"Probably will not return. Yuck !! 
I had jumbo tequila shrimp, disgusting with bad bad after taste . 
Husband had prime rib, bad cut that was muscular and chewy- not tender."}
{"text":"got the 16oz prime rib and it was EXTREMELY fatty. cut off about 30% of it. the seared tuna was decent however it didnt have that much flavor unless you added the wasabi ginger dressing"}
{"text":"The absolute best prime rib in the business! Barely more expensive than outback but far better quality. Spoke to the GM, Mark who asked how my experience was to ensure I loved the meal.

Awesome place!

Thanks"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, great atmosphere, best Pineapple martinis (double black diamond), the lobster spinach queso starter was delicious.  The bacon blue cheese & the prime rib were savory. The carrot cake was very moist with warm cream cheese frosting"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today because it looked way nicer than everything else in the mall, which was a correct assumption because this place is fan-diddly-tastic!

I just went for a burger. I'm a simple man, I see a burger, I order it. Easily one of the best burgers I've had. Not over dressed, just cooked perfectly with some smokey cheddar on a perfect toasted brioche bun. Nice char on the outside of the generously portioned patty, insanely juicy inside.

My wife got the chicken pasta which more than hit the spot. Generous portion, a little smokey, a little spicy. So good! She never gets excited about having leftovers but it sounds like she's already got her lunch planned for tomorrow.

The place itself is pretty cool inside, stacks of wood and exposed beams. Dig it!

Our server was great as well. Very attentive and friendly. He stuck around after all of our awkward mayonnaise jokes so he's a good egg in our book.

If you like good food, they make that here. In a mall. Like really good food. We love it and we're definitely coming back!

If nothing else the bread is shaped like a butt which is equally hilarious and delicious."}
{"text":"Ate here today and had the Strawberry Shrimp salad - it was delicious. Had a glass of red wine and my meal was complete.  The server (Lee) was very attentive and knew his stuff - good job! I like the inside - it feels cozy and I like the wood smell."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. They mistakenly brought out the wrong plate which had lobster on it when we ordered shrimp but they promptly brought the right dish out. They offered to let us keep the lobster at no charge which was about a $15 dollar difference. Our server Joey was very polite and up beat. Had a great experience at this restaurant"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a great steak dinner without breaking the bank. Convenient location off of the 101 and Bell Road. Waitstaff is super friendly. Restaurant, bar, and bathrooms are all very clean and tidy. Can get a little noisy when it starts to fill up...acoustics in this place aren't the greatest. Everything I've tried on the menu has been delicious. Try the BLT salad with filet on top...super yummy!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner one night...we sat in the tented addition to the restaurant and it was very pleasant.  The food was very good as were the drinks."}
{"text":"Usually the restaurants I have been so far had either good food or good ambiance. This is one of the few restaurants that have both. I had ordered cilantro grilled chicken with meshed potatoes. They brought it with some kinda sauce which was awesome in taste. It spiced up the entire meal. A good meal was backed by an excellent service."}
{"text":"Had a $10 gift cert so decided to try firebirds again.  Reluctantly sat at the bar (see my previous experience) and had a bacon cheeseburger and fries with a couple blue moon beers.  Pedro was nice to quickly take my order, and brought me the beer - but without the orange.  He had to then go cut an orange and bring it back to me to put in the beer.  No problem.  The burger was cooked to medium with a little pink, and the bacon was nicely cooked and crisp - very tasty burger - the wood fire grill adds lots of flavor. The bun was a little weak - did not really hold up until the last bite.  I sat at the left side of the bar and was trying to watch the baseball game on the tv above - but the blinding sun glare from the glass door to the left was as if I was in a spotlight - not very comfortable - was really bothering my eyes - they should have had the shutters closed.  The steak frys were good, but unfortunately the small amount of ketchup they had brought in a small plastic cup ran out with more than half the frys still remaining.  I understand that these so called upscale places do not want a ketchup bottle sitting around- and yes I could have asked for more instead of eating the last half of my frys dry, but come on Firebirds, no need to skimp on the ketchup...     Pedro was nice and polite, but the girl working with him never acknoweldged me, said hello, no smile, and never offered to get me another beer when I had completely finished my 1st beer.  But the burger was tasty, and with the $10 gift cert, it was a nice deal.  I will try them again since I live close by."}
{"text":"Food was good as always. Service however, was phenomenal! Ask for Anthony, he really made our dining experience enjoyable and easy. I will be requesting him from here on out. Thanks for a great date night Firebirds!"}
{"text":"Great food. Coldest beer in Frosted Mugs. Carrot Cake is to Die For. I suggest order Carrot Cake first"}
{"text":"I just can't get into this place. Maybe it is because the prices are a bit high and the menu a bit limited? It's just \"meh\" to me."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! The food was delicious. Loved the fried spinach. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! 
Our waiter was Abdul and he was fantastic! 
He accommodated us, was very proactive and efficient! :D He honestly went above and beyond! He did things ahead of time, you have to think ahead and be on top of things which he did!
Being a former waitress I really appreciated his service because you can't find service like this too often, especially back home in California. Thank you Abdul for creating a experience that will bring us back if we are in AZ again. 

Food:
Complementary bread was unique and delicious!
The pretzel bread and cheese dip was so good 
Grilled mahi tacos yummy with tater tots"}
{"text":"For whatever reason, i had never thought to eat here despite frequenting the Northlake area over the years. A friend recommended trying it when we were looking for a date night somewhere between TGI Fridays and Ruth's Chris.

Our server was great. i ordered the hot steak with poblano mashed potatoes. i wasn't a huge fan of their special steak sauce and thought the steak was just alright. Potatoes were good, as was the Cesar salad. i sampled the wife's Buffalo Meatloaf and thought that was very good. If i had enjoyed my entree more, everything would have been about top notch. 

The Big Daddy Chocolate Cake was actually worth the $7. It was very good. It was big enough for two to split and we even have a small chunk waiting as a leftover...speaking of, i should eat it before the wife does.

Not a place with any sort of beer selection, best options were Sam Adams or New Castle. 

Free valet parking was nice."}
{"text":"Service is Excellent here!!!  Much better than \"Brick Top's\" in the Service area!  As far as Service they are also better than \"131 Main\"!  Servers here are more friendly and much more attentive than \"Bricktops\"!  Firebirds Servers know their Menu better than both the others!  Don't you hate going to eat at a place where you know the Menu better than the Servers?!?

On Food Quality Firebirds is Very Good, very similar to the competition!

On Food Flavor, FireBirds competition wins on almost EVERYTHING, yet Firebirds (at least this location) continues to improve!  I have eaten here more than other Firebirds locations (I have eaten at the Stonecrest Location three times, North Lake Mall two times and Winston Salem once)...

Baby Back Ribs Quality 5 stars... The Flavor is Very Good, though the Sauce is not good enough for these Ribs!  \"Brick Tops\" wins first place and \"131 Main\" gets a close 2nd place, Firebirds loses on flavor, still they are very good, close to 4 stars... These would be 5 star Ribs if the Sauce were better...

BBQ Sauce (Java) sounds like it could beat almost anyone, it does not!... 3.4 stars

Slaw (Tricolor Tortilla, Purple Cabbage, with Roasted Pumpkin Seeds wins over \"Brick Tops\" and \"131 Main\"... Slaw is not that important to me!

Baked Potatos are much better here than \"Bricktops\" (Bricktops has been known to not serve Baked Potatoes at Lunch and run out of them at Dinner, when they do have them they are not that good... One of the Bricktops Managers said Baked Potatoes are not that popular with their customers AND that Baked Potatoes are Labor Intensive, they really only want to serve Fries!

Firebirds Steak Fries 3 stars

Firebirds Sweet Potato Waffle Fries 3 stars

In the War of the Fries (their is one in the World of Rod0) Bricktops beats almost everyone (not counting those who use Goat Fat, Coconut Oil or Lard) 131 Main has Very Good Fries too, though I would not go just for those!

Onion Rings 3 stars - \"CowFish\" and \"Red Rocks\" win the Fried Onion Awards, Roosters could compete well here too!

Key Lime Pie - Bricktops beats everyone in this category - NOTE to The Owners of Firebirds, start with a new Crust, best thing to do is go to Bricktops and get inspired!  I would rather be eating here than either of the competitors and that is why I keep coming back here... My friends and Family want to go to Bricktops because the food is better... Do NOT be afraid of your competition, you have them beat in Service by a LONG shot!!!  Go in their and get a piece of Pie... OR you could have a Public \"Stand-off\", don't do that you are not ready for it!

2nd Note to the Owners tweak your BBQ sauce or CHANGE IT COMPLETELY!  Bricktops is Beating you here and I'll tell you a Secret and it is NOT a Bricktops Secret it is and \"OUTLAW\" Secret : : Peppercorn Blend!!!  Your Ribs are HIGH Quality and Deserve e a better Sauce!!!  You can do this...if so many people like your BBQ sauce keep it and make an improved one and see what happens!

3rd Note to the Owners - This one IS Personal!  I WANT YOU to WIN!!!"}
{"text":"Prime Rib and French Dip was excellent. We will definitely come back here when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Loves our meal here.  Good Caesar salad with tenderloin!  Kids meals are huge!  Great ambiance.  We'll return"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch here on Mother's Day. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal and the French Dip got a \"best ever\" vote. Now I must go back to try it! 

The salmon on a salad with their citrus-lime dressing was absolutely perfect. 

Our service was spot on! Kudos to the staff handling the pressure of a packed house on a holiday."}
{"text":"Firebirds is good not great. First the bread is not typical, heavy and semi felt, steaks come with one side.  I substituted soup for side.  Ribeye cooked right, fattier than most, only about 1/3 very good rest just okay - will not order again. The soup New England clam chowder was good different slightly spicy.  Service was great."}
{"text":"We had Sunday lunch there; it happened to be Super Bowl Sunday, but also my birthday. It was hard to find a close-by upscale restaurant that was going to be open, and Firebirds was my third choice. When the restaurant opened, it was a favorite of ours, and the food is still very good. But just like the last couple of times we were there, the service was slow and very inattentive. The place was nowhere near full, as it used to be every weekend meal, perhaps because people really don't eat out on Super Bowl Sunday--I'm not sure about that. It seemed they were short-handed. We ordered an appetizer (onion rings) which was delicious and generous, but we had finished it long before the server took our dinner order. We waited almost an hour for our entrees. Again, the food was very good, and still a good value, but we kept wondering where our server was. We had to ask for bread for the table, and flag her down for drink refills. She never updated us about our food, like saying the kitchen was backed up, or they were short staffed. I guess we will go back, but only when we have plenty of time to sit at the table and wait."}
{"text":"We were invited to the soft opening and we'll definitely be back! Tasty cocktails, amazing seared ahi appetizer, we tried both salmon entrees and they were equally delicious! Excited for this new spot in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"The daughter and I made another trip to Phoenix last week and we did what we always do while in AZ:  we tend to frequent a lot of chain restaurants and this is a chain that we had yet to try.

We came here with my Mom for a late lunch (after being picked up from the airport) around 2pm to a fairly empty restaurant. This place is land locked in between PF Chang's, Cheesecake Factory, Buco De Peppo, Elephant Bar, Red Robin and a slew of other fast and non fast food chains. 

Our waitress was really nice and we were all glad we brought in sweatshirts because like all AZ restaurants, it was freezing inside. The menu had a lot of great offerings and my Mom and I both chose wood-fired grilled salmon served with perfectly al dente veggies and for me, Parmesan mashed potatoes and Mom's with a baked potato. Daughter opted for some kind of salad with stinky cheese and a cup of their tortilla soup. We were also served fresh baked sourdough bread with cornmeal crust that had Kevin been with us, would have been replenished many many times. The bread was AWESOME. 

My salmon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I was super pleased with my meal (it was huge for lunch and at $14.00 including the large helping of fresh vegetable was better than my favorite chain salmon that only comes with rice and 5 or 6 snow peas). The daughter LOVED her salad (I didn't taste it due to the stinky cheese) and the soup was flavorful but thick like the kind Chili's serves and not in a good way. 

I would come back here in a heartbeat and avoid some of the other monstrosities  around."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a friendly hostess. Server was also friendly and very helpful with describing menu choices. The ribs were good,  actually were excellent,  but portion could have been larger. The baked potato wasn't hot and needed more flavor. Soup also needed more flavor. Grilled chicken salad with brussel sprouts was excellent. We loved the fresh squeezed lemonade with vodka. I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had another great meal here last night.  This place can't mess things up.   My wife loves the Colorado chicken salad....but the secret is to order it \"Stirling\" style. Trust me on this.  It rocks and he is a great server as well.  Now if they just get Kiltlifter on tap......heaven."}
{"text":"I have been going there almost 15 years now I believe; maybe a little less. Everytime I have gone the food has been outstanding. The service has always been great, very friendly and professional, and the atmosphere is pleasant too. Recently have noticed a decline in 2 dishes and I hope I have just had a couple off nights for them and that this is not a sign that things are getting bad because I love going there. They may have changed food suppliers pertaining to shrimp and steaks because both were off the last 2 times I ate there. I will give it 3 or 4 times total and then I simply will not order those 2 dishes anymore but I will still keep going; unless something else comes up. All and all if you have never been you will enjoy yourself, it is a nice experience."}
{"text":"First off, the service was excellent! Our waiter (young guy like myself) took care of us very well and had some great conversation. The steak was absolutely delicious!! We also had the pretzel sticks and the chicken fingers which was certainly a great decision to order on my part haha. The only downside was the price for the steak which I felt was a little steep for the dish, but we will definitely be back nonetheless. If you're teetering on the edge about coming to this restaurant.... come!! You won't be disappointed- especially with happy hour prices. Loved this place and very happy to have gone!"}
{"text":"best service..food...kobe meatloaf and carrot cake with salted caramel
best i ever had. the manager is very tuned into everyone and awesome 
experience quality everything.

victoria m."}
{"text":"Outstanding foos and service. I would strongly recommend this place for a nice dinner and a cocktail. We will Be back soon."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Firebirds... They have great steaks and service. They have a casual atmosphere that everyone can relax."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.... Everyone welcomes you and the atmosphere is great... Strongly recommend you eat here... I love this place.... Brett does a great job behind the bar."}
{"text":"Came to the Phoenix area for a foodie trip and try a few places.  This was one of the locations we wanted to give a try.  We were very happy with this choice.   We had the onion rings and deviled eggs both were great.   Our main entree we had steak it was great.   Well worth the drive from Las Vegas to hit this place!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I was on the hunt to find a restaurant in Phoenix that served lobster bisque.  Unfortunately, I never found it. 

What I did find was Firebirds.  The only thing I had yesterday was a fruit smoothie.  I was so bogged down with work that I missed lunch and by the time dinner rolled around I was famished.  All day I was craving lobster bisque, I went all over town looking for it.  My hunger got the best of me so I stopped in at Firebirds.  

I've never been but I saw the Shrimp and Strawberry Salad on the list, and I know I had to have that.  In obervation of Lent, I was not eating meat.  So this was the perfect choice.  I ate the bar and had a drink (my usual 3 Olive Cherry and Diet Coke), watch Apolo Ohno get DQed from the short track (that was BS call in my opinion), and I scarfed down my salad.  It was sooooo yummy and surprisingly very filling. 

I think the thing I like most about the restaurant was my meal.  The bartender was very nice.  I think her name was Callie.  She was attentive and quick to bring me my drink (definite plus).  I would like to try other meals.  My only minus is that I felt the prices were a little high for a chain restaurant should be.

All in all, I had a good experience and I'll be back for that salad. YUM!"}
{"text":"I am not a big meat eater, but once in awhile, when the urge for a full carnivore meal works its way into my brain (and stomach), I look for a place with some quality beef. Well, let me tell you, Firebirds is that place. Great decor and the staff could not be better. I had some questions and for every question, there was an answer, whether technical about the cooking or the menu items, the answer was right on and happily given. I decided on the BLT Salad to start and like other reviewers here, it was a great start and for lunch it could have been that all on it's own. While feeling quite satisfied with the salad, I did come for a hunk of beef, so I moved on. What caught my eye was the Pepper encrusted Sirloin....medium. It arrived with Parmesan mashed potatoes and I should have taken some pictures. It was cooked just right, a bit red but not overdone. The pepper crust was wonderful. Needless to say it was just what I was craving.  Cannot say more, this is a great steak house, you will not be disappointed with your meal here. It is a bit pricey, but for a good steak house you expect to pay out a few bucks. If you are going with a bunch of friends, do not grab the check, unless you want to be \"the Man\". Full 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had been to Firebirds years ago with friends on a couple of occassions.  I remember loving the ambiance but the food was mediocre at best.

Recently, the hubs and I were in the area and decided to stop for dinner. We had a great waiter who was very knowledgeable and helpful. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp appetizer and a Ceasar Salad for my meal. The hubs had a cheeseburger with fries. 

My meal was delicious although I will say I chose not to try the slaw that comes with the shrimp. The mango chutney/ marmalade the shrimp were dipped in was refreshing and scrumptous.The Ceasar was just the right balance of both garlic and creamy dressing. 

The hubs said his cheeseburger was cooked to perfection and the fries were some of the best he has had. He also enjoyed iced tea with his meal which he was pleased was refilled without request when the waitstaff saw the drink was getting low. 

Perhaps the best part of the evening was when the waiter gave us a coupon we were not to open that could be discounts off a meal, free appetizer or desert or an array of prizes. Thanks to this little coupon, we planned to come back the following week. :)

***One week later***

We decided to use the FB's coupon this evening as we were having a celebratory dinner. (we just found out that we are having a BOY!)  Again, we had a wonderful waiter who was pleasant, knowledgeable and super helpful. (Such a nice change from other restaurants where the servers don't seem to care about their customers one bit) 

The server immediately sent the Manager over to open our coupon. We discovered it was for a free appetizer. The Manager however said we could do a free dessert instead if we desired. 

We decided to order the crab cakes as the appetizer. Unfortunately they were cold. :( And I wasn't crazy about the fact that they are made with blue crab instead of Alaskan King/Dungeness crab but they were still tasty.  The cakes came with the same chutney and slaw the shrimp I'd enjoyed a week earlier came with. This time we tasted the slaw. Oh. My. Gosh. It was so refreshing! 

After the appetizer, we decided to split a hamburger and a Ceasar Salad. Both were delicious and we finished our meal feeling as though we ate just the right amount.

But as quickly as that thought came to mind, our server comes to our table with a HUGE brownie a la mode and salted caramel for over the top....compliments of the chef. Such a wonderful gesture and it was indeed fabulous. But it was what pushed us over the edge of being just filled up to feeling like we were FLOATING out of the restaurant.

All in all, both experiences were wonderful. AND because we got yet ANOTHER coupon (and we both received free appetizer coupons for joining their mailing list, looks like we will be going to FB's more often than not."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch/early dinner. We were quickly seated, greeted and water was brought for us. A new waiter took our drink/food order. A few moments after our drinks arrived bread and butter was brought to the table. My husband ordered the meat loaf which looked scrumptious, and he was very happy with his order. I ordered the cilantro chicken breast, and was not as impressed. A rather small butterflied breast and other then the single sprig cilantro it was just grilled chicken with a cheese sauce and 2 bland onion rings. Drinks were tasty. Our waiter brought us our check before asking if we saved room for dessert, which was a bit odd. We will visit again and hopefully they will have worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have eaten here, but when I last went I had a horrific experience.  I got the chicken salad, which was full of dark meat, bone, gristle, skin, etc.  I had to run to the bathroom and get rid of it.  When I returned to the table, I calmly explained to the manager I was unhappy with the food (you could see that the quality of food was really low.)  The manager was rude and I had to argue with him to remove the meal and my drink from the bill.  I would think that after a customer was caused to vomit he would have already taken my meal off the bill...at the least.  I'd never go back.  I wrote a letter to the head chef of the chain and copied the manager and got absolutely no response from either.  Poor food.  Poor service.  Poor management that goes all the way up to the highest level."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very good service. Excellent value for the price. Always eat here when we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went for a nice dinner out and left frustrated.  We ordered drinks first and our appetizers came before our drinks by minutes.  Our waitress barely stopped by unless dropping something off. My meal came and and was missing my baked potato and when I asked for it we were charged extra for it. It was supposed to come with the meal. Needless to say if we are going for a steak dinner soon it will not be Firebirds.  The steak was delicious but not going to pay extra for what my meal should include nor wait 15 minutes for our drinks."}
{"text":"Takeout is always a difficult review to give but I think it stays true to the core of the food and how it was prepared. We ordered the filet, saluted spinach, the ahi tuna app and the prime rib. The filet was cooked well and was tender and juicy. The prime rib was also cooked well though not enough to Caramelize the fat. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the wasabi sauce had a nice hint of spice.  The sides however were not prepared well. We had both the sautéed spinach and the green beans.  The spinach was horrible. Saturated in butter and garlic and dripping with juice. The portion size was also so small that I thought it was an oversight.  Lastly the price was high for the quality of the meal. The steak quality was average, the appetizer was average, and the sides were below average.  In my opinion, if you need takeout, save your money and go somewhere else for the same quality meal."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go.  Service is on point.  Bread delicious.  Salads crisp fresh. Salomon is perfectly cooked.   Staff amazing.  Great place to take out of town family, great holiday dinning.  Cannot say a bad thing.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Very disappointed when arrived to discover they have only 2 handicapped parking spaces.  It's a busy location and we are meeting friends who need a handicapped spot.  There's another restaurant next door and lots of activity in area as near Chandler Mall.  Don't recommend if you need handicapped spot.  Also, direct access to front door requires being able to go up 2 steps.  Not handicapped accessible."}
{"text":"Lodge-like decor and a very diverse menu. Open kitchen and the sweet smell of fire grilled meats wafting throughout the building. A great start to a belated Mother's Day dinner with my escort--my 7 year old grandson.

I had the chili-rubbed Delmonico steak (perfectly grilled) and southwest au gratin potatoes ($22). My grandson had the kids ribs (they say half rack, but sure looked like a full rack to me), steak fries, fresh fruit, lemonade and an oreo cookie ($8.95). We both enjoyed the hot sourdough bread and butter. The food and service were terrific. We both had to take about half of our food home since the portion size was so large.

Parking is ample and close to the door. The background music was some of my favorites from the 70s and 80s. Would definitely return for a special meal. Might try the trout, salmon, or pasta on the next trip."}
{"text":"Service was awesome!!!! Our group had the tuna salad, bbq burger with sweet potato fries and colorado salad!!! The food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Last night  my  hubby  and  I  went  to Firebirds for a birthday meal and we enjoyed every  bit  of  it.  I will start with our server very  nice  and  courteous.   She continously  checked  on us bringing  drinks etc  always with a smile. 

The food was great and plentiful.   We started with with  an appetizers  of coconut  shrimp  and lobster queso and it was great.  We were almost too full for entrées.  We had prime rib for our main meal which was also delicious.   The steak so tender and plate so big we needed a doggie bag.

Prices were pretty good ambience  was great.  I will  happily  return."}
{"text":"We called for a 530 reservation. Arrived around 515 and seated at 535 ish.. I was worried it would be around 6 since typically even having a reservation somewhere doesn't help much. Anywho, service was great, food was great.. Husband ordered the 9 ounce filet mignon and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and fries! Steak was amazing - which should make me give them one star for giving my husband the idea that I might be able to cook a steak that way! Haha! 

I'm surprised we've never been here before! We will definitely be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a nice warm Thursday evening. We sat on the patio, there was no wait. The servers were prompt, well dressed and groomed. I was very impressed with the place after I've ate at other restaurants in Northlake and not really enjoying coming back to certain places in Northlake.

Anyways, I ordered the cilantro grilled chicken breast with Parmesan mashed potatoes--absolutely delightful. It came with some sort of mild chipotle or orange sauce on the plate, but whatever it was, I want to put that stuff on everything. 

I would definitely recommend this place for family dinners, a wonderful date night dinner, or a place to have dinner with a group of friends. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place obviously draws a big lunch time crowd and was packed when we arrived at noon on a Tuesday. To be fair, the wait to be seated was only about 10 minutes. Service started out VERY slow, as it took us almost 20 minutes to even place our order. Once we did, our lobster queso dip appetizer arrived fairly quickly, and to be honest was the highlight of the meal. Cheesy goodness with large chunks of lobster and spinach. I would recommend starting with it. Lunch itself was fairly uneventful. My turkey club was fine, but rather lackluster. The fact that it came on jalapeno bread was one of the reasons I ordered it, but the reality was it lacked in flavor and was a little dull. The co workers I ate with enjoyed their Durango burgers. I could go back if I was with someone who wanted to go, but this wouldn't necessarily be a pick for return visit from me. It seems popular, perhaps dinner is a better experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. I really haven't tried anything that I didn't like. Their service is awesome too. I've been there fro lunch, dinner and a party on the patio. Every time I have enjoyed the experience. They have the best Steak Salad!"}
{"text":"Very good beer as I was waiting for steak and lobster dish. I really liked the lobster queso and chips. Steak was delicious and lobster was alright. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the steak !  Service was friendly and the price was on par with high quality of the food. Very refreshing local Sun Tan beers on draft. Bartender and staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and were warmly greeted by our waiter Daniel.  
Had lots of questions and he had the answers to all of them.  The burgers are great as are the salads.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars was because my ribeye was over cooked, but it happens.  No big deal.  They cooked another for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Be sure to try the bleu cheese sauce with port mushrooms on top of your steak, it's delish!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for an early Christmas dinner. We made a reservation for 7 and were seated in a booth (yay!) immediately when we arrived. The wait staff was friendly. I ordered the sesame crusted salmon which was AMAZING. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon medium rare and shrimp. It came extremely rare and cold in the center so he returned it to the grill for a bit. Waitress was very friendly about it and didn't make us feel like we were being a burden. When the steak came back it was perfect so we were happy!! I had never been here before and I was very happy with how everything was since it's not an inexpensive meal. :)"}
{"text":"I work down the street in the Northpark Executive Park area. Our office found that we constantly order from the same places so we decided to do pick-up from Firebirds as something new. Cassy (I believe that was her name) helped place our order for about 10 people and was VERY helpful. The order was perfect, she wrote each person's name on their order, and even helped me carry the bags and drinks to the car. Not only was the service great, the food was as well. My co-workers and I are happy to have a new lunchtime go-to."}
{"text":"I love this place. My first time there, I asked if we could sit by the fireplace instead of waiting to be seated... I didn't want to go any further.  The fish taco's were excellent."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not great. Waitress was very friendly and attentive. The bar has traditional seating as well as lower tables, which is a nice alternative to high tops."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a couple of times, both times with a large group for a birthday, no reservations.  Both times the service was outstanding, everyone was friendly and professional,  The first time there I had a burger, which was very good but a bit expensive.  This time I had a portobello sandwich which was absolutely amazing!  i have never had one that good before, and will have it again next time.  Our server was Tom, and he was one of the best servers I have ever had, anywhere.  He was funny, engaging, competent and spot on with everything,  He was a blast.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent experience, service, food and atmosphere. Good variety of menu items, especially steaks and seafood."}
{"text":"I am very happy to revise my previous review.  I am also very happy to say that the Firebird's that I normally love is back!  I knew my last less than stellar visit was a fluke and I was right.  This time, Firebird's lived up to my expectations and exceeded them.  We took my grandmother for her 86th birthday as she is also a fan.  We had a table for 8 people.  I am mad at myself for not remembering our servers name as I would love to give her kudos.  She got all 8 orders right and they were to perfection.  She had a great attitude and was super friendly.  Our food was  really good and the restaurant was clean.  All the things that were not right last time, we right on this time.  I am so happy that things are the way they should be!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Firebirds since it first opened and on a regular basis. I can honestly say we have never had bad service or a bad meal. It is hard to choose a favorite but a few of my favorites are: loaded baked potato, the meatloaf, the creme brulee cheesecake is to die for! Don't miss out on trying a bottle of Firebirds Red...yummy!"}
{"text":"Firebirds in Northlake Mall is a great dining experience.  I had the cajun chicken pasta dish and it was wonderful.  My wife had the fish special of the day and raved about it!  
The chocolate cake for dessert was amazing and seeing that it is one of their signature desserts I can highly recommend it.  (And I'm not even a big cake person).  
The atmosphere is cozy and the service was excellent. 
The only negative is that you need to deal with mall traffic and parking during busy shopping periods.  Otherwise this is a wonderful place to dine!"}
{"text":"So underwhelmed by Firebirds - haven't eaten here in a while and wow it was not what I remembered!  Service was average - some mishaps that I can overlook but the staff looked miserable and lacked personality.  The food was awful - strawberry basil lemonade is gross-pure syrup almost bubbly and a huge basil leaf that isn't muddled.  The portabella sandwich was blah - too much spinach, and maybe a teaspoon of goat cheese spread so thin you can't taste it.  I'd give this no stars but the steak fries were good and my friend said his burger was good.  Too many options in this area to waste your time here"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our Anniversary here recently in their Charlotte, NC location. The service was exceptionally attentive, our food was cooked to perfection, and each course came out at the perfect moment. Never too soon or left us waiting too long. The hand crafted drinks were incredible and really captured the season we were in.  (mmmm.. Bourbon and Peaches!)

The food was just as exceptional as the service and while side dishes were somewhat steakhouse standard familiar (Mac and Cheese), they had special little twists to set it apart (Green Chile Mac and Cheese!!)

The only slight disappointment was the dessert. We ordered the Warm Brownie sundae and the brownie was ice cold It was still soft and yummy, just not hot/warm or gooey. When we commented on the temp to the server (not complaining since we ate 3/4rs of it), he apologized profusely and removed it immediately from the bill.

I've been to dozens of local and chain steakhouses across the country like The Palm, Wolfgang's, Capital Grille, Sante Fe Steakhouse of Killington, etc... This is by far the best \"chain\" steakhouse location you could ever want to visit. Worth every last penny spent!"}
{"text":"Three couples for dinner on Father's Day.  First impression - a beauticully done atmosphere.  The bar/lounge area just invites you to sit down.  So we did - 8 oz pinot grigio and 8 oz  chardonnay (house) = $23.  Huh?  So I started out with a bit of a chip on the shoulder - house wines should never be that high, and these were unknown brands.  And I kind think offering a choice of 5 oz or 8 oz is unneeded. Go with an 8 oz, get the price into the $7-$9 range for the house.

Ok...now we went to the dining room.  Very nice.   This place is so like a hunting lodge in the north woods.  Great waitress and good service.  And the food was excellent and the prices were on the high side, but not upsetting at all.  By the way...go for either one of the salmons...or for a huge salad..  I'll vouch for all of them.  Wish the filet was a little more juicy - it was med rare and plenty of red, but not much juice.  If you order the spinach side, be sure to ask they go lighter on the garlic!

So now, the score.  I'll go with 4.  Still upset about the wine, but not enough to ding them."}
{"text":"Just finished celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary at Firebird's. What a great, friendly, comfortable atmosphere for a celebration of any kind. Also awesome for any meal!  Servers are professional and friendly. We told our server that it was our anniversary and she made it special by putting two candles on our dessert. I thought it was very sweet and thoughtful. 

I love the interior too. Wood and beams with an inviting feel. The bar is awesome and makes you just want to hang out there for hours. I love all the glistening bottles on the wall. 

On to the food: My husband's meal was OMG delicious! It was pasta with braised beef, spinach, cheese sauce with a hit of spicy. Comfort food at its finest. I had the filet kabob with roasted veggies and mashed potatoes. It was very good, but I should have been more adventurous in my selection. Like I said, my husbands dish was to die for. 

Dessert was just as yummy as the meal. Try the crime brûlée cheesecake!  So danged good. 

As we were getting ready to leave, the manager stopped by to say hello. Nice touch! We will likely go back in a few months when family is in town. This is a special occasion place for us and we love it that way."}
{"text":"When I dine here, I normally get the Delmonico and the Southwest au gratin potatoes along with a Caesar salad. If I don't order that as an entree then I get the shrimp and strawberry salad. Both are absolutely delicious. I also love the warm, crusty bread that comes with the meal. If you plan to have an appetizer, I suggest the lobster queso. I always receive great service but I have to say that Tripp is wonderful so I always tend to ask for him. 


GRILLED SHRIMP & STRAWBERRY SALAD
Mixed greens, goat cheese, jicama, spiced pecans, balsamic vinaigrette

CHILE RUBBED DELMONICO*
A tender Southwestern-accented favorite

LOBSTER SPINACH QUESO
Lobster, baby spinach, tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, tortilla chips"}
{"text":"Super service. I have food allergies that limit my choices on most menus. The staff bent over backwards to accommodate me. The chef personally delivered my meal. The sautéed spinach and tomatoes were lovely! Thanks Firebirds for making our meal so enjoyable and worry free."}
{"text":"It's been two years since I reviewed here.  Time to renew.

This time we showed up for Restaurant Week.  It was a decent deal.  Hard to know if the portions were a little smaller, but the filet medallions with bleu cheese sauce on the menu is almost as much as the RW price was.  So can't really complain there.

I actually ordered the \"flat iron steak\" (which is a particular cut of sirloin).  I thought the portion a bit small, but not horrible.  The garlic mashed potatoes were a generous portion.  But I didn't taste the garlic like I expected.  Their signature Fired-Up sauce was too heavy for the sirloin.  Very strong flavor totally overpowered the meat.  It might have been more appropriate for a rack of ribs or something similar.  The meat was served in a puddle of that sauce.  I found a quick tap on my plate seemed to remove most of the sauce, and the little bit that was left was not too overpowering.  But they really should have used an au poivre sauce (or maybe a red wine sauce).  Would have been a better match.

The key lime pie was REALLY good.  Too much whipped cream, but that's easily removed.  Really good.

I wish I could go 5 stars, but I can't.  The sauce selection for my entree just did not work, and the garlic mashed tasted more like a cheesy mashed to me.  Not a lot of garlic (I really didn't taste any).  But I can go with 4 stars for now.  I'm sure we'll return at some point (we seem to come here a few times per year) and I will update my review again."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever. Their service was great and food too. My wife had the spicy pasta dish and loved it. The lobster queso dip was to die for. Great ambiance and great food. Will be one of our favorites from now on. Highly recommend and prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Excellent Deviled eggs and jalapeño turkey sandwich! Bartender was fantastic and friendly."}
{"text":"We LOVE Firebirds!! Great food, great staff and also the option to sit out on their patio. Firebirds is always busy, and they really have their act together. Two favorites are the Pecan Encrusted Trout and Sesame Encrusted Salmon. Just wish they'd add a couple more simple green veggies to their menu, like Brussel Sprouts & sauteed (not fried) spinach. I'm not a desert eater, but I've been amazed at how my husband can devour a whole portion of one of their (beautiful looking) deserts. He recently INHALED their Banana Cream Pie \"special\"."}
{"text":"Great steak, amazing potatoes, very attentive service. Boyfriend and I both had the ribeye, wings, and a few drinks a piece. Bill with tip was a bit over $100--not bad! 

Seems that others have had issue with the doneness of their steaks. I didn't have a problem. And I think steak doneness is a tough one. Oh well.

I didn't see any reviews about the bread. OMG. It is amazing--crusty on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside. But this is a grill, folks, so go for the steak (but you'll talk about the bread, trust me)."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at Firebirds with my mother.  I am a big fan of Firebirds, they consistently have really good food.  It was fairly busy and service was good.  I had the crab cake salad and mom had the cilantro grilled chicken breast.  Firebird's salad are always a good pick.  They have a great variety, from fried chicken, grilled chicken, shrimp, and crab cakes added to a really fresh mixed green salad.  The cilantro lime vinaigrette is a must.  However, I was a little disappointed with the crab cakes today, a lot of bread crumbs and filler and not very much meat.  I don't know if it is a new measure to cut cost, but not as good as it once was.  On the other hand the cilantro chicken was tender and grilled perfectly.  I will of course go back to Firebirds, but probably won't order the crab cake salad again."}
{"text":"Firebirds is my favorite restaurant ever! Try the creme  brûlée cheesecake and the steak Au poivre!"}
{"text":"I'm keeping this review very simple because I was in heaven while eating their incredible, perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth filet mignon. Their parmesan mashed potatoes are to die for. My husband got the prime rib and it was perfection. This restaurant is beautiful and the service is great. They really know what they're doing. Excellent steakhouse!"}
{"text":"What a waste of money. The service was fine but the the shrimp were rubbery with no taste of \"lime butter\" and the filet  was burned on the outside and very very rare on the inside instead of medium rare. I asked for steak fries as my side and got about five of them. My husband had the ribs and he couldn't tell you what they tasted like because they were swimming in way too much sauce. This place is way overpriced for the quality. Don't waste your money like we did."}
{"text":"First time I was there they under cooked my chicken and my friend's Salmon. The side dishes were extremely cold. We had to send the food back to the kitchen. It took a very long time and the manager at the time decided to get our food to go and told us we didn't have to pay because of the experience we had.
The next time I went my burger was under cooked, I just ate it because I didn't want to send back my food.
The last time I went everything was correct and cooked properly. But not sure if I would go back. The waitress we had was great."}
{"text":"The meatloaf is the best!! The service is always great!! Can't go wrong here, everything on the menu is superb!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great service.  Love how the manager always checks on you.  They have a few things that rock my world.  I recommend trying.  Mac and cheeseis the best I have had.  The baked potatoe is the best I have had.  I know it seems weird to pick or rate a place for that but I love them.  I also love the fresh baked bread.  Ten times better than cheese cake factory. We had a Ribeye last night that simply rocked my world.  Two things I don't like but are popular the spinach and the medallions.  I recommend going for the filet instead.  Best restarant by fashion square mall.  You have to try it"}
{"text":"Awesome! Our group of 4 had a great dinner, including dessert. Our service was perfect, the manager came by to check on us and the food was exactly as ordered, delicious! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"First time here and the service was great. Everyone was nice and our waiter was superb. He explained what things were on the menu and was around when we needed him. I ordered the firebird house Margarita it was good and pretty strong $10. I ordered the steak delmonico and it came with southwest au gratin potatoes. The ends on the steak were nice and crisp. I ordered my steak medium well and it came exactly how I ordered. The seasoning just made my mouth water. My bf got a chicken with a dressing on it with fried onion ring and mashed potatoes. I had some of his chicken and it was thin but so tender! We will be back!!!! Thanks firebird and our waiter for being great!"}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant when I lived in Memphis and was very excited to find one in Arizona while we were visiting. Unfortunately my expectations were far from reality. Our waitress was rude from beginning, she only made eye contact with the men at the table and even neglected to enter one of our orders. Three dinner entrees arrived 25 minutes later when we had ordered dinners for four. The fourth entree was delivered to our table about another 20 minutes later after everyone else had already finished their meals. The waitress failed to apologize and the manager gave a subpar apology. The food quality was not worth the wait or the horrible service. The only positive things about this visit were the cocktails and the very nice hostess staff."}
{"text":"My family's go-to spot for any celebration/holiday. Love the ahi tuna salad."}
{"text":"Wow. Loved this place in chandler. Even better In Gilbert. Best service in town and those double diamond martinis are dangerous."}
{"text":"This is a middle higher end chain restaurant. The atmosphere is suited for a large group of people more than for an intimate get together between a couple of friends. The food was pretty good, and so were the drinks. The service was just fine, but there was really nothing special about the visit."}
{"text":"The lobster spinach queso is my new comfort food- tasty, served hot and a generous portion. I had the 7 oz filet with the pepper crust two weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head- the pepper crust is perfect! I'm a fan for sure, but the pineapple martini I had was overpriced and not very good. I'll be back for the food for sure, but will stick with beer next time."}
{"text":"Great steak house and good service. We ate at the bar and the bartender Charlie was super. Recommend the double diamond cocktail."}
{"text":"I did not have any idea about this place. A friend recommended we go there for lunch. The facilities were great and service was top notch. I was impressed with their attention to detail. The food was fantastic, had the French dip, mashed potatoes and green beans. All were cooked to perfection. The candied pecans could go on anything and would add a nice sweet flavor and great texture. I highly recommend this place for lunch and look forward to exploring the dinner menu in the near future"}
{"text":"One casual Sunday I decided to stop in for some lunch and a drink because the mall food court wasn't appealing enough.  While sitting at the bar I engaged in some fun debates with other patrons about the game going on and awaited my food.  I ordered a salmon salad with a viniagrette dressing.  When my food arrived, I was excited about the size and the amount of salmon that i got on the salad.  It was very good.  I haven't ventured back because the price for my salad, and two drinks was alittle too pricey for me to justify a lunch by myself at a bar.  
The service was great though and I appreciated the bartender leaving me alone and knowing when to come back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile and hospitality by Zach. He also walked us through the vast menu of deliciousness to our liking. He really went out of his way to make sure that we were satisfied with our order! I highly recommend this place to all of those who are fed up with the same old boring pizza."}
{"text":"Great food.  to eat here when in the area. I really don't like to be interrupted while enjoying my food, this staff understands that."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp are awesome, scallop potatoes great. Steaks are great too. Salads too! Large portions. Great ambiance, like a classy mountain lodge. Great staff. I was impressed, all of the food coming out of the open grill kitchen looked awesome!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for dinner at 7:45 on 03/03 and 4169 Kristen was absolutely the worst server I have ever encountered anywhere. No greetings, absolutely no smile, an attitude throughout our dining experience as if she was doing us a favor. There are separate pricing for 5 oz and 8 oz wines and although we ordered 5 oz, we were charged for 8 oz. when I pointed this out, I was Again was told it was correct only when I insisted, the error was rectified with no apologies. 

The food quality was extremely bland as well - Cilantro Grilled Chicken was very stringy and bland along with the Pineapple chicken.

Also we were given a small booth with a chair in the end with limited and cramped space for 5 people to eat..

So overall it was a disastrous experience from poor bland food, rude server to cramped and uncomfortable seating.

Based on this, I would not recommend this restaurant for anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious foods, great service, and a American upscale rustic atmosphere. Close to our favorite movie theater so it's the perfect place to grab a bite before or after a show (and they are super considerate if you tell them you're in a hurry if you go before a movie). 

The prices are reasonable and the menu exhaustive of anything you're in the mood for from salads to seafood. I highly recommend the BLT salad if you want something light and refreshing. The burgers are juicy and prepared to your exact specifications - never over or under done. 

Everyone is friendly from the hosts to the servers and are willing to help refill your drinks or bring you more dipping sauce. Be sure to swing in to this wood fired grill."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, we loved the atmosphere and the waitress was superb. Martinis and food were impeccable. A++ and we'd love to go back."}
{"text":"First time visiting, outstanding service and food. The sirloin you could cut with a fork and the salmon was excellent.  Matt and Bree were excellent."}
{"text":"Wish we could pack this place up and take it back to Ohio with us!  Menus have a very good variety of offerings.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic all around.  Prime rib was prepared to perfection.  Steak kabobs were equally well prepared.  The kids meals got 2 thumbs up from both boys - 1 had the mac & cheese and the other had the wings w/ bbq sauce, and they both had a double helping of the fresh fruit (and it was actually FRESH fruit, NOT a prepackaged fruit cup).  All in all, I'd highly recommend!  Hope they bring this chain east to Cincinnati, OH."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the Charlotte area. Always great food and wonderful staff.  Half price wine on Mondays and happy hour food specials in the bar area."}
{"text":"This place seems like a local version of Cheesecake Factory. Don't know for sure, but food really caloric. Overall, food is good. 

Waitstaff is really pushy about some things, asked about ordering one appetizer about 5 times."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. The manager went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our entire meal. I cannot recommend this establishment enough. I wish we lived here so we could come here every week."}
{"text":"Had dinner Thursday evening around 7 pm. Had to wait 20-30 minutes; good crowd. Had drinks at bar- very good mojito. My wife had the filet special, done perfectly with a side house salad. I had the Parmesan crusted flounder with a side Caesar.  Very flavorful and plentiful. It was the next day's sizeable lunch.  All in all a very good dinner, a couple of glasses of wine and a couple of very good mojitos."}
{"text":"Excellent steak with great service. We both ordered the aged ribeye and they were cooked to perfection. Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The best prime rib anywhere.  The BLT salad is a standing starter for us."}
{"text":"I love Firebirds. Its warm and cozy. I like to sit in the bar (until they changed it now there is just uncomfortable hightops with stools where there was a nice long bench seat with tables before)  or along the outside of the middle because it can get REALLY loud. 

Food - 5/5
Really haven't had bad food here (only thing i haven't liked is the Sesame Chicken) I like grabbing the Soup and Salad for lunch with the BLT Salad and the Chicken Tortilla Soup.

Service - 4/5
Always good.

Atmosphere - 4/5
can be loud, but always a comfortable \"log cabin' \"winter resort' type feel

Price - 2/5
Price is a little high but this certainly isn't a Sizzler.

Overall - Try it out you wont complain."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time with my better half. We walked in the bar was full except two seats at the end. Sat down was greeted by Kirstie and was offered a happy hour menu and food menu. Placed our drink order and took our time with the food menu. Finally figured out what we wanted to eat ordered and was greeted by Sam now. The food drinks and service was excellent. I will definitely be returning just to sit at the bar with the two of them. Amazing. Can't say enough how pleasant  they made it."}
{"text":"The staff was great, food was good. Great no major issues. We were there for a birthday party, the waiter was over whelmed but he did a good job overall."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and everything was perfect! Got there in time for happy hour and had great service at the bar prior to being seated. Once we were seated the waiter kept our drinks filled the entire night. 

The NY strip was cooked perfect and tasted the same. My wife had the Filet and shrimp, which I heard was fantastic. I can't say for sure because she wouldn't even give me a bite since it was so good. The meat for both steaks could have melted in our mouths. Did I mention that our steaks were under $30? Good luck finding a better deal on a better cut of beef somewhere else.

The manager did his job and made his way around to each table. I was very impressed with this, because not all of the restaurants still take the time to check on the customers.

Well done Firbirds!!!!"}
{"text":"Surf n Turf was very good. Best cheesecake on the planet. AWESOME Ceasars salad. Service was good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here this week and ordered the Kobe meatloaf. It comes with green beans and mashed potatoes. This place is really nice and the staff are really friendly."}
{"text":"Want to love this restaurant when I go in and I do.. it's beautiful! Fire shrimp is great! Ordered the salmon dinner and was a small portion for the price and potatoes and  veggies were cold.  Also the cheeseburger on a different occasion and it came out cold and the cheese not melted.  Restrooms always seem to need attention too."}
{"text":"Consistent!  We order the same for to go bi-weekly when we just don't feel like cooking, ahi app with side house salads, sweet potato fires and wings. Yummy!  Their ahi is very fresh and seared perfectly.  The house salad is served with cinnamon toasted pecans, and the sweet potato fries are naughty but nice!  I give it four stars instead of five because when waiting for your order at the bar, the drinks are poured without a sense of urgency, which we all need after a long week."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised. Walked in, Music was blaring. Asked if they could turn it down They did. Service from server, asst server and Mgr was terrific - always checking to see if everything was ok. Solids food recommendations, tasty choices for burger and chicken sand. Very enjoyable, will return to this or other locations."}
{"text":"Delicious!!. Ribeye & filet mignon was superb as well as the coconut shrimp w 
Slaw & habanero mango relish. The blt
Salad was a home run too. Along with a strawberry daq. Will most defiantly be back.
I must not forget the bread. Umm umm
Umm good.. Now I can fast for a week.
Be prepared to be stuffed up to your eyeballs.. I just mite need to get a oxygen
Machine after downing all of that. Whew!!"}
{"text":"This re-grand opening for the Southpark location was absolutely amazing!!!!

The staff and management (yes AJ that would be you) were just outstanding. Candace was our bartender. She was the bomb. Very informative in her opinions on drinks and bar bites. I bumped into my gurl Bianka & though a bit packed we were able to fit together at the bar.
We were lucky enough to get to try all of the bar bites. They are all amazing!!!! Even if you don't like certain foods the presentation alone is outstanding. Did I mention the drinks are to die for. They make pineapple vodka in house and will use it in their cocktails. It is YUMMY! 

I cannot wait to get a chance to come back here. It's been a bit since the event. I wish I could have finished this review earlier, but I am making an effort to get back here so I can write a follow up review."}
{"text":"This was the second visit, in as many weeks, and the cuts of Rib eye and Filet were very good on both occasions. I would suggest the Rib eye. See Photo."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere - relaxing- great bread!!!!  Our meals had plenty of food. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I love going here delicious sirloin and the durango burger is amazing. I will say been here about a dozen times everytime my fiance gets a sirloin medium rare, only complaint is the kitchen always undercooks or overcooks it at least half the dozen times we have to send it back. Normally i would give 4 stars because of the hassle but being its steak it can happen and the manager always gets involved and makes sure we are taken care of. No hassle at all and redeems the evening for us. I never get his name but he has orangish red hair very pleasant guy.  Even the servers are kind and on point.

Overall my favorite dish is the durango burger there drinks from the bars are also good. I would suggest to skip dessert though i am yet to have a real impressive dessert here but none the less i dont come for the dessert."}
{"text":"What another great experience at a Firebirds location. I was craving a steak and this was right around the corner. The steak and an gratin potatoes were so good. As was the pineapple infused seasonal drink. However all the credit goes to Joe!  He was exceptional. Very personable, friendly, and kind. Great recommendations and really toon the time to know us!"}
{"text":"This new location is so busy! I'm sure everyone in Gilbert is happy to have a new restaurant to go to. We had appetizers on happy hour in the bar and they were a little backed up. Which is understandable because they were so busy! The food was great and the service was even better! Everyone is super friendly and hard working. This is a great addition to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Although I am not a big fan of chain restaurants, the excellent food and service at Firebirds made me change my mind. 

The most difficult thing was getting a reservation that wasn't like the \"early seating\" time on a cruise ship(we got one at 5:00 and the place was already full!). Make sure you call early for your reservation!

Reed, our lovely Server, was like a Ninja sneaking drink refills in without disturbing our rather lively conversation but was also so friendly and personable answering our questions that we never felt rushed. 

Our food was delicious, especially the salmon and the blue cheese filet. The daily chicken tortilla soup with some warm fresh bread was a delicious start to the meal. 

We were celebrating birthdays and a personalized card to each of our birthday girls was delivered with a candlelit bowl of ice cream. We did the singing ourselves!

A nicely stocked bar and wine selection was available as well. Fabulous evening! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a higher-middle quality end chain food... almost on par with The Keg but not quite - also not as expensive as The Keg. I go here every so often.

One big turn off to me is this place tends to be very loud and it is difficult to have a relaxing dinner unless we get there early. The kitchen is open to the dining area and the dining area is basically one massive, high ceiling, room. Should have been designed better for a quieter, more relaxing experience in the dining area."}
{"text":"This place is okay, slightly over rated. Their menu has a small selection and is fine for people looking for a limited selection of steak and seafood entrees. 
The atmosphere is nice (a little dark) which some people enjoy the dark firelite feel. I personally like to see what I am eating."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Beautiful atmosphere, attentive service and delicious food.The food was perfect from the bread basket to dessert. Ok, so I may have had some steak in between too ;)  I actually had the filet, which was perfection, with steak fries and seasonal veggies. My friend had some sort of amazing looking grilled chicken salad and we split the cheesecake. So fabulous- we will be back!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered barbecue chicken with shrimp and strawberry salad.  I have had ALOT of different meals from this place and usually everything is good.  The shrimp and strawberry salad is really good but it was over top mostly iceberg lettuce with a few pieces of spinach randomly thrown in.  I really don't care for ice burg lettuce and it definitely wasn't what I was expecting because on the menu said over top of mixed greens.   The Bbq chicken had excellent flavor but something was wrong with how it was cooked or it was old.  The skin was very tough on most pieces, to tough to chew and on some of the pieces the meat was dried out like it was freezer burnt or something.  I gave 4 stars because most of the time the food is on point.  Be careful with their carry out though.  Not as much care goes into it as when you dine in. BUT management is awesome and always fixes complaints plus gives you next meal on them for your inconvenience."}
{"text":"I had the crab cakes, and they were not as good as I was expecting.  Perhaps there were no eggs or bread crumbs to hold it together, so I got a crumbled mess.  There could have been a little more herbs or seasonings with it.  The lemonade was flavorful but extremely sweet.  It wasn't my best dinner."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a little underwhelmed. I'm on vacation visiting my family in the area and I've seen this place multiple times on other trips down to PHX and wanted to try it. Finally, my chance came and my friend and I gave it a try.There was no line but we sure waited a while to be seated. Then once we did get seated, it took a while to get our orders in. The server(s) were friendly but we seemed to change hands with them a lot only seeing our first server about twice in our area. Once we did get our food, we weren't too impressed. My chicken was tough and hard to cut. Tasted okay but not super good. My friend had chicken as well and although she said it was dry it did have a good pineapple(I think it was pineapple) salsa on it. Once we decided to get our checks, we waited about 15 minutes for them and they were incorrect and they forgot our boxes. Once we got it figured out and got our boxes, we left. Overall, slow and inconsistent service, dry food with *meh* flavor.  I really wanted to like this place but it kinda fell short. I may want to give it another try but we'll just see."}
{"text":"First time guest with friends & out of town guests. Had the sirloin which was wonderful &  other guests were raving about the salmon.  Comfortable atmosphere,  our server was a gem (I'm thking Shelby?) very friendly & made some personal recommendations which one in the party took her suggestion. Good wine selection,  great service,  & delicious food. Totally recommend!  Thank you Firebirds!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. The lobster dip was Luke warm but good flavor. The steak was excellent. Cooked perfectly and great presentation."}
{"text":"Firebird's responded to my negative review promptly and apologized for our experience.  We tried it again and had a much better meal.  Thank you Rita for your quick reply."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I love coming here!! Its one of those places I can only afford every once in a while, but when I do its awesome. Try the bacon wrapped, blue cheese filet with port soaked mushrooms...wow...melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The rep reached out to me and after following her directions, I was pleased to see they had offered me a \"do over\". The phone disconnected and on the third try for a takeout order, I was greeted pleasantly by someone who took my order then and there. Within twenty minutes my food was at the bar ready for pick up. Great service this time around."}
{"text":"Usually I am a fan of this place, but my husband and I went there for New Year's eve last night with some friends and I ordered a salad with seared ahi tuna and have been sick from about 3 hours after I ate it through now (still going strong and no one else in our group fell ill)...I know there is always a risk ordering raw tuna, but just wanted to give fair warning to anyone thinking of ordering that dish. Safe to say if I ever got swayed into going back, I would definitely be ordering something else."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and Coconut  shrimp. ...servers were standing around...took forever for our server to greet us.....I ordered sangria. ..was asked if I wanted red or white...I said Red.....what seemed like forever  ..was presented with white...I politely stated \" oh is this red?\"...server said no..he grabbed the wrong one off the bar...then it took about another 5 minutes to get my correct drink.  Our order came out....the fries were wrong...I ordered sweet potatoe...got steak fries.....The coconut shrimp  were delicious...wings were ok...sliders were cold....when we got our correct order of fries they were cold.....overall Not impressed!! So glad I didn't come for an expensive steak dinner....and wondering why I have all this time to write this review yep...waiting for my server to bring the check as my credit card is sitting on the table for the past 7 minutes ..at least the bus staff has cleared the table! HOPE MANAGEMENT  READS THIS AND SEATS WITH WAIT STAFF! mine in particular."}
{"text":"What a nice place. We had a team dinner there. It was a little warm sitting right by the kitchen, but service was great!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Firebirds, I am now fanatical about steak. As a Firebirds newbie, I didn't have high expectations before I went, so I read reviews from my fellow Yelpers and checked out their menu online. I quickly learned that Firebirds is known for steak and figured I may as well go for their 'specialty' when I visit.

I went on a Thursday evening, the place having been chosen by a dear friend who's abandoning me - I mean moving onto bigger and better things :) We met around 5:30 and were immediately seated. I had arrived earlier and noticed that the bar section was a little busy thanks in part to their happy hour promotion that takes place during the week. 

We placed our orders for the bacon wrapped 5oz filet mignon (medium); I requested a loaded baked potato and my friend went with fruit as her side. I also had a glass of pinot noir to accompany my meal.

Mouth-watering. juicy. succulent. cooked to perfection. I was completely blown away at how delicious my (our) steaks turned out. I've always had a complicated experience when it comes to ordering steaks at restaurants so I'm usually wary when I see my plate come out. Firebirds went above and beyond in exceeding my expectations. The filet was everything I previously described and more. I am still thinking about that piece of meat (#thatswhatshesaid) now at two days later.

My loaded baked potato - complete with sour cream, cheese, bacon bits, and scallions - was hot and even lightly salted on the potato skin. Everything was delicious. I even commented during my meal that the steak made me feel like it was my first time ever having steak because every other steak I've had largely fails to compare.

I was very tempted to order dessert but my friend stated that it was best to end the meal on a high note and everything on the dessert menu just sounded heavier than what I was in the mood for to indulge.

Bravo Firebirds! I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Firebirds. When I was at the university (UNC-Ch) I frequently dined at the one in Durham. When I am in my hometown I dine at the FB in Winston-Salem. Both of those locations got me hooked on firebirds.

The firebird's at this location, however, as noted by the past couple of reviews seems to be a bit below the standard expected. The food is great. It's the service that I feel can be improved. 

The hostess are polite enough but neither of them in the numerous times I have gone have greeted me or thanked me for dining there. Every time I am finished eating and walking towards the exit, I am the first to say thank you, otherwise the hostess usually doesn't say a word. This isn't the biggest of deals but when you are spending decent money, I feel like the hospitality should be kicked up a notch.

On my last visit (two days ago) we dined late and were seated promptly. My date noticed that the floor was quite dirty with pieces of food and trash. She didn't make a big deal out of it, but I know this restaurant can do better. 

The food is fantastic, the hospitality and cleanliness could use some work."}
{"text":"The customer sevice and ambiance here are always great. The managers have always taken care of any issue we've ever had.

The prime rib is really, really good! So is the Steak Au Poivre!

That said, I have to admit that the rest of the food can be pretty hit and miss. I've never had  awful food here, but several disappointments. The managers and staff are so polite and work so hard to make things right that we keep coming back.

The pricing is a bit high for the inconsistent quality, but well worth the early bird and happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"Second review here. The food was mediocre on last visit. So I thought I would give these guys another chance.
Second time around was just as sub par as the first visit.
Ordered a steak medium well. Confirmed with the bartender medium well. And she said yes medium well. So I said do you guys typically undercook or over cook your steaks. She said we will cook it exactly how you want. 
Well it came out pretty darn rare. I could barely eat it. See pictures.
Manager did come over to make it right but it was too late and 2 visits too late. I won't be coming back again. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. You wont fool me three times."}
{"text":"While visiting the greater Phoenix area, we were looking for a good steakhouse. We found Firebirds on a Yelp search while driving around. The place was pretty busy on a Thursday evening. We were seated after about a 10-15 minute wait. Our waiter was a very knowledgable young man who was not only familiar with each item on the menu but the bar stock as well. He recommended a good gin for my martini which was perfect. I ordered a large cut prime rib medium rare and requested that it be braised over the wood fire. It came out absolutely perfect. My wife had the Mahi fish which she enjoyed and shared with me and I agreed, it was great. Good appetizers and salads as well. We will definitely be back next time we are in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"- Delmonico's Steak Sandwich!!! -

**Not kidding , this item will easily go on the list for the best things I've ever consumed!

Came in here during lunch hour, 20 minute wait so we sat at the bar.

The staff is friendly and attentive 

The clientele is mostly businessmen as this is chandler and lunch time.

The food is incredible and I would recommend the restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Normally this is amazing and our go to place with guests, tonight was slow and the service was terrible, slow, forgot our orders, disorganized, had to ask repeatley for refills and more drinks etc.
Where was the manager drop by or a thank you going home.
At least the food was awesome as always"}
{"text":"I came here Friday night for a work dinner and as always the food and service was fantastic. I've  been here a few times before and everytime I come here the food is always great and the staff is friendly. I was with a large party  and the servers who helped us was really nice and very on point. They made sure our drinks were never low and made sure our party was well taken care off. I ordered the surf and turf which had a small steak, lobster tail with mashed potato. Then my co worker and I shared the cream brûlée cheesecake which was  the perfect way to end our dinner :)"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Firebirds.  Cool atmosphere & you immediately know you're in a steak house when you walk in by the wood fire aroma.  I had the prime rib and it was one of the best I've had.  Price was fair, food quality overall was great.  The only thing keeping this being a 5 Star review was out waiter was rarely at our table, and another waitress was keeping tabs on our drinks.  Maybe they have a different way to handle table responsibilities.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"OK....there may not ever be a review I write that will be able to match the amount of pleasure and excitement as writing this one!

Firebirds is AWESOME...period!!

Have you ever wished for a restaurant that has the perfect atmosphere, perfect service, amazing menu, huge wine selection, did I mention perfect service, great prices...THE place to go when you want the best of the best???  Well my foodie friends, THIS IS THE PLACE!

I have been here probably 40+ times with as few as two people, and as many as 8 people, and have never ever had bad food or service.  In fact, it is always SUPERIOR!    

The food is fresh, hot and delicious, as well as inventive and portioned generously.  The atmosphere is fantastic....want a bar with food and tv's...they have it.  Want a softly lit dining room with a fireplace and good music...they have it.  Table, booth..it doesn't matter.  The servers are always super attentive, professional, courteous, friendly, and fun.  The wine selection is incredible.  The steaks are fresh and always cooked how you order them, the chicken is juicy and fresh, the hamburgers are mouth-watering, the seafood tastes like it was just caught, and the salads (especially the Colorado Chicken salad with goat cheese instead of blue) are huge, fresh, and tossed with the perfect amount of dressing every time.

Now, for all this, you would think the prices would be really high...they are NOT!  i have spent more at Chili's for far less!!

Whether it is a romantic dinner, casual dinner with friends/family, or a special place to take visitors from out of town, this is the one and only place I have been to in Charlotte that excels in every category time and time again!

Hats off to Firebirds for allowing me to spend a generous amount of my income enjoying the best food in my life there!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Texas I've had more than my share of steak (particular Prime Rib). At the request of a personal friend (also a Chef) I decided to dine at Firebirds just for the Prime Rib. After having my server check to see if they had \"true rare\" Prime, I ordered it. 
All that I can really say is that if you love beef the way I do, you wont be disappointed the least bit. I would even venture to say that it's in the top 3 best Prime I've ever experienced...including the one I make myself!"}
{"text":"Should be a 3.5 stars. We called ahead to be put on their wait list, was told they couldn't because no wait.  It was 530 pm. We thought Great! First time there so got there in 10 mins. Wait now 45 mins. Hmm..ok...that can happen i guess. We waited.  We were seated about 1 hour from walking in,  lovely place, but i noticed lots of empty tables and booths. Odd. Our server was wonderful! She was there seconds upon sitting, got us drinks, i had the lovely peach/raspberry margarita, family had tea and we ordered. 
I ordered small filet, to which i requested medium well, i know most people think that is bad, but i don't eat much meat and i explained to server, i just don't want it red and dripping. She offered to have it butterflyed, to which i was not sure of the benefit so i declined. My husband and son ordered much larger steaks both medium. Theirs arrived the way they like, pink through out and mine was butterflyed and rare. The plate literally was soupy in blood. I know many people LOVE that.  I am not one of those people.  When my waitress came,  i said i am sorry this steak is to rare, she stated that is medium well, i pointed to my husbands steak which was medium and said his is not that rare at medium. She was very sorry and took it back to kitchen, my family continued to eat and about 15 to 20 mins later she returned with my steak re-cooked and less bloody. It was not very good. Edges were pretty tough,  center was tender but this was not a big steak. I have never had a steak re-cooked that was good before. But i just ate what i could.  When waitress asked how things were, i said ok. I left all the hard areas on plate. Disappointing. My husband and son were fine with their meal. But for $120.00 it should have been a touch better than ok.
I might try again,  for lunch.  The staff was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Hello,
 I would give five stars but they don't give military discounts and being retired the selection of restaurants we usually go to are selected by cost and quality.
Honestly,the food was spectacular service was outstanding atmosphere fantastic overall a good five stars if they gave military discount I would have added the extra star.
Many restaurants throughout the valley give a standard military discount anywhere from 10 to 20% it doesn't make a difference We will be back to Firebirds restaurant just not as many times as we will be back to Red Robin which gives a good military discount."}
{"text":"Damn I failed my own suggestions. 

We had some drinks here... the billreflected it too. 

I had a burger, which was perfect. Baked spud. 1 Captain and Coke which seemed a little lacking, so I asked the waitress to have them make it a little stronger the next time. Yep... charged for a double. So MY drink tab was almost 20 for two drinks. 

My beautiful wife had a killer salad, added chicken and split a bottle of wine with a BFF. $34 for the bottle. 

Some how the bill was $95 including tip. WTF 
95
-20
-17
=58 For a salad and a burger??? I am calling the manager."}
{"text":"I only went here for tater tots...obsessed much! Anyway i got my tater tot fixed but then found so much more. Cocktails are so good here. I got Desert Pear Maragritas. So yum almost rivals Ztejas margarita. Also got mahi tacos...not my favorite but tasty once i fixed with more salsa.
Will be back to test out steak.."}
{"text":"I have been here many times.  And ironically, the worst meal I ever had from the place is the reason why I am writing a 5 star review.  Every experience I have had here has been great.  Their firebird chicken pasta is awesome, they cook steaks right and season them well, and the place is cozy.  A few days ago, I took my fiancee here and she got a burger and I got steak tips.  The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as I come to expect from the place.  I had no intention of complaining, or changing my opinion of the place since I've always had good meals there.  But, the manager came by to ask how the food was when we were finishing up our meals.  I didn't even know she was the manager, she just seemed like a nice person who worked there and was genuinely interested.  So I told her the truth.  

\"I've been here many times, I always enjoy it, and this meal wasn't bad, I just wasn't as good as usual when I come here.\" She asked if I had tried this particular meal before, and I told her I had not.  I even told her I don't mean to complain, because it really wasn't bad, and I certainly will be here again.  

After a brief chat, (she was super pleasant) my fiancee and I finished up and waited a minute for our bill. Our server came over and said \"Don't worry, this meal was compliments of Firebirds. My manager said you guys discussed your experience with her and were very friendly, and we appreciated your feedback and the fact you were really nice about it, and she wants to make sure you always get the best experience possible when you come here.\"

I was floored.  I even told him the food was not bad, and neither was the service, and she didn't have to do that.  He insisted, so I left him with a really nice tip and my and my fiancee walked out of there as happy as can be.  I was really impressed with how they handled my honest feedback, and I always have a good experience at Firebirds.  This place is managed right, that's for sure.  Extremely impressed!"}
{"text":"The place is overrated.  It is good food, but nothing special.  The glass I was drinking water out of had some dry white wax like food on the bottom side of it, disgusting, but at least it was on the outside of the glass.  The wait time is still about 30 minutes after the reservation time, however, the waiter did an awesome job.  The pricing is expensive for what you get, 20 to 30 dollars a plate.  The ambiance is decent, but nothing extraordinary.  My advice, go next door to Texas Roadhouse,  it's cheaper, huge portions, and you defiantly get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I use to work here so I may be biased but I love all there food!!!everything is made from scratch! I love the Blt salad with chicken it is awesome!cant go wrong with whatever you get there"}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal here. Started with their pineapple martini which was amazing. Followed by their coconut shrimp starter, tenderloin salad, and the chile-rubbed Delmonico steak (which is one of the better steaks I've had in a very long time). If I lived nearby, I'd probably come here regularly."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dining experience.  The onion rings were crunchy and delicious.  My steak was well prepared and cooked deliciously.  My husband's burger was quite good.  We were surprised by how well prepared everything was."}
{"text":"This steakhouse has an amazing menu, lots of variety but not overwhelming. I had the wood grilled salmon and my husband had the prime rib, and both of us were very pleased with our meals. Both of our entrées were perfectly cooked, and my mashed potatoes were devine! When I was not sure what kind of cocktail to order, our server recommended the house cocktail special, a pineapple martini. It was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the creme brulee cheesecake to share, again, delicious. Our server was friendly, attentive and kind. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The energy and ambiance was great. Greeted by bubbly enthusiastic hostesses. Once seated our server was very attentive to our needs. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. Party of three feasted on lobster dip, crab cakes, shrimp skewers, spicy green beans with pecans(more sweet than spicy but still good.) prime rib and baked potatoes. I would say the most surprisingly pleasant part of the evening was when someone other than our server came over and changed the remaining portion of the cocktails on tables to fresh chilled glasses. What was in the glass you might ask???? That pineapple infused vodka drink they serve. Not a drinker but I tasted it and my buds were quite pleased"}
{"text":"Went for celebratory lunch, Burger was amazing. Tater tots awesome. I don't expect much in terms of Arizona costumer service (timeliness, attentiveness etc). The service wasn't terrible but, it wasn't great either. Food was great, especially for the area. Service: average."}
{"text":"Debated between 2 and 3 stars after late dinner here on Sunday.

Called ahead to put us on the waiting list and informed it would be 50 mins wait. Arrived 30 mins after making a phone call, still told another 30 mins. Since a patio table was available right away, decided to take a patio table, I thought it was nice.

Service.... I think other server beside our assigned server was more helpful than her. She would often forget things, my glass of coke stayed empty for a while, just seemed overwhelmed and tend to not care about us on the patio. Other servers were nice.

Food.... I had blue cheese filet with loaded baked potato. Since they coated potato with so much salt, every time potato shifts on my plate, excess salt will get on steak, making my food overly salty. filet mignon was okay, had better cut. Blue cheese was nice, unfortunately it just got too salty from baked potato, I just couldn't eat anymore. Complimentary bread was actually very tasty. 

Nice ambiance, located near the Chandler mall, perhaps I visited during their off day, but based on my first visit, this place will not be my first choice of restaurant to eat again as there are so many options nearby."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was absolutely delicious!  You know the food is good when it shows up and everyone quits talking.  Everyone enjoyed their meal immensely and the server was also fantastic.  We will definitely be here again."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy!  We visited on a Sunday afternoon (1-ish) and it wasn't busy. We were seated right away by a wonderfully friendly Hostess. Our server was with us immediately and every time we needed her. 
I ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with tater tots. TATER TOTS!!! Delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly, juicy, full flavor and the tots were amazing! I mean, how good can a tot get?  This good. Order them now.  
My husband had the BLT Salad and a Turkey Club (and tots of course). Everything fantastic across the board. Ranch dressing was definitely home made and the bread to start the meal (although shaped like a butt - which I thought was hilarious, because apparently, I'm an 8 year old boy) was hot and delicious! 
We will definitely be back to try some of the other amazing things that people have been posting."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Firebirds at Northlake for dinner. It was crowded when we arrived, so we opted to sit at a table in the bar thinking we would get faster service and be able to keep up with the World Series on the screens. It took a few minutes for our server to approach us, but she was friendly when she did finally greet us. We ordered drinks which then took 20+ minutes to arrive even though we were at a table adjacent to the bar. Thinking they were shorthanded, I watched as the 3 bartenders yucked it up with the servers around the bar making martinis. When she finally came back, we ordered salads and dinner. We didn't see her again for a while, but finally ordered another round of drinks once our salads arrived...which took another 20+ minutes. Another customer across from our table was obviously complaining to a mgr during our wait, so clearly they weren't having a good night at Firebirds. Dinner finally arrived and we gave up on drinks and had water. We asked for and paid the check the next time I spotted the server. I asked her why the service was so slow and she responded \"she really didn't know, but maybe it was because they had happy hour?\" I asked what was included in happy hour and she explained \"house drinks and half price appetizers\"...who knew? We paid for our full price drinks and dinner ($100) and left. On the way out, the hostess asked how was dinner to which I responded \"unusually slow\". The mgr was standing there and said \"we are still learning\". What an unusual comment and clearly without a care that it will be a longgggg time before we ever return. Oh well, lesson learned! Poor service and customer relations for a restaurant that could easily have done a better job!"}
{"text":"I've been to Firebirds on Bell in Peoria twice now.  The first time I went with one of my friends from out of town, and the experience was one of the greatest I've had at a restaurant.  The server was exceptionally alert to our needs, and the food was amazing!  I ordered a steak rubbed with their special chili powder, and my friend ordered their baby back ribs.  Both were perfectly cooked and tasted awesome -- one of the best steaks and best ribs I've ever had.  

The second time my parents came into town and I took them there to celebrate my dad's birthday.  Again, the food was amazing and the service was great.  Portions are large (at least for steaks), and again cooked to order.  I also highly recommend their desert pear margarita... it's extremely refreshing, especially in the summer.

Bottom line -- one of my all-time favorite restaurants.  And my friend's only complaint was that they didn't have a Firebirds in Houston!  I can't wait to take my fiancee there when she comes into town!"}
{"text":"Staff incredibly polite and attentive. The filet was delicious, highly recommend it!! Also, the lobster cheese dip...yum!!!"}
{"text":"A few months ago, I was headed towards another restaurant to use my gift card, but wandered into Firebirds by mistake -- and what a happy \"mistake\" it was!  This has turned into one of our favorate places to go.  The food is consistently good.  By signing up to receive emails, we've gotten coupons for appetizers, desserts, and discounts. 

Someone else mentioned s/he wasn't a fan of open kitchens.  However, we do like that arrangement.  It's far enough away to not be intrusive.  The bar has a fireplace that's nice to sit by on chilly days.  

The fresh-baked sourdough bread is among the best served by any restaurant. The coconut shrimp appetizer was big enough for a meal, and the grilled tenderloin salad enough for a male friend of ours.  For dessert, I'm not usually a fan of brownies, but the salted caramel sauce added just the right touch."}
{"text":"Love this place! A new discovery we went recently and they inadvertently put bacon on my salad but quickly rectified it and we even tried the creme brûlée cheesecake yum! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try and it was very busy. People were waiting to get in for happy hour. I had made reservations and we were seated with no problems. My wife had salmon she said it was good. We were celebrating a anniversary but that was over looked, I guess the hostess never told the server. All I could tell you is the service and the bread was good."}
{"text":"My family went for my dad's birthday and was very happy with everything this place had to offer.  The hostess was very friendly and our waiter was attentive and kept up really well without asking us too many questions.  Our family had: the aged ribeye, New York strip, Kobe meatloaf, coconut shrimp and the grilled shrimp and strawberry salad.  Everything was flavored very nicely and fresh tasting. The meat was cooked to perfection and tender to taste.  The coconut shrimp was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The vegetables were crisp and fresh. The food was aesthetically pleasing and portions huge. I am very happy with this place and will be back again !"}
{"text":"Took our waiter about 5 minutes to come see us after we sat down. Order the onion rings for appetizers, along with our burger and steak. 45 minutes later. Just as we were about to walk out our burger and steak came. From a different waitress. We let her know we didn't get out appetizer she did apologize and brought those promptly. Our food was great. The manager came over and apologized and took the rings off of our bill. The people behind us had waited a while but their food was cold... Our waiter was gone the whole time. Since all of our food was good we will give it another shot"}
{"text":"Don't know what the food was like... we waited 15 minutes at our table and were never greeted. It was a late lunch and the place was quiet. Pretty disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  Enough said.  My kid who is a picky eater hammered through his food and wanted more."}
{"text":"This is a great moderately priced steakhouse. It's a little cheaper than in used to, as I usually only go to higher end steakhouses. It definitely has the wood fired feel, with brick/wood interior and a nice patio to the side. The servers are above average. They were a little slow when I visited, but nothing too terrible.

They start with cornmeal bread and soft butter. The butter melts onto the bread, and is so soft. I could eat four to five of these loaves and be one happy man.

Appetizer - lobster queso with homemade tortilla chips. Even though I'm not usually a fan of combining cheese and seafood, this was quite good. It also had a nice kick to it. The lobster was fairly fresh and cooked well.

Salad - wedge salad with bacon. Definitely a solid salad in my book. Nothing mind blowing, but solid quality.

Steak - 9 ounce bacon wrapped filet with a salted baked potato. For a more moderate steakhouse, it was really good. Sure, it's no Durant's, Ruth Chris, etc, but it was quite good for the price point. The steak was very tender and salted appropriately.

For a casual meal, this place is a reliable option."}
{"text":"The food is quite good here.  Essentially anything grilled is good.  Service has always been good if not perfect.  My only complaint here is that the prices do seem a little high for the value provided.  I guess that is the nature of a corporate restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went out to dinner w/ my best friend and her husband and I must say that everything from drinks to appetizers to my entree was absolutely to die for.

We indulged in the onion rings as an appetizer but that's not the highlight of my night.  I settled for the spinach salad w/ salmon and it was everything I wanted and more. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the spinach salad house dressing was out of this world!

Needless to say, I could not eat the entire salad because of the enormous portion size, but trust me when I return, I plan to make sure I have an appetite so that I can eat a plate full of perfection!"}
{"text":"Our family searched high and low for a place to eat late on Christmas Eve.  Since two of the members work retail, we were limited to whatever was open past 8pm, which turned out to be this fine establishment.  Even after numerous apologetic calls having to delay our reservation, the staff was more than pleasant and accomodating both on the phone and in person.  Not once did we feel unwelcomed.  Our waitress was very nice and all the food, from the lobster queso appetizer to the various steaks, were all cooked to perfection.  It all made for a very enjoyable and memorable Christmas Eve night."}
{"text":"Double black diamond was good! Nice and refreshing. I got it on the rocks. Jalapeño devil eggs were on point...bonus with the bacon. The aged ribeye was just ok as was the Durango burger and the sides. I would come back. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"First class service and outstanding food right here.  My first experience here and I was pleasantly satisfied.  They had no problem having 2 servers attentively handle 19 people.  Apps were spicy but tasty and the steak was perfectly prepared.  Must try the double black diamond pineapple martini!"}
{"text":"Nice dinner / service from Shannon was excellent. Would recommend the lobster spinach dip! Was disappointed with the bread, especially since many people mention how good it is. We had a variety of food ordered at our table - from high end steaks to a basic Chicken sandwich - and everything came out as ordered."}
{"text":"Christmas lunch with friends Glenn, Mindy, Collette. Always a good time. I had the prime sandwich with French dip and fries. Hot and crispy fries. The prime butter tender melt in your mouth with a soft roll. Key lime pie for dessert. Love this place. Always great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Firebirds and it will definitely not be the last. We started with cocktails and they were both great (I got the pineapple martini which was so refreshing and not overly sweet).

We started with the lobster queso which was so good. Not super thick but a perfect consistency and there were nice chunks of lobster. We then both got the spinach salad and every component was delicious. Lastly we both got steaks (me the ribeye and the hubby a chili-rubbed delmonico). They were both cooked to perfection and so tender and buttery. 

We were too full for desert but will try them out the next time. We will definitely will go back and try out other items."}
{"text":"We like Firebirds. Service has always been great, and food is very good and reasonably priced. The bread they bring before your meal is delicious, especially when is hot from the oven. 
I had tried the quesadillas, buffalo meatloaf, sirloin steak, and a pasta dish. The pasta was nothing to write home about.  My 1 1/2 yr old loved the mac & cheese, a definitely more upscale version than Kraft, made with penne and a white cheese sauce. I recently had the shrimp, strawberry and goat cheese salad and I really enjoyed it. The shrimp were a tad too salty, but over all it was very good. I loved the jicama and spicy pecans, it added a nice sweet crunch. 

I must say that during one of our visits I was going to order the peppercorn crusted steak and the server was honest enough to tell me: Unless you reaaaaaally like pepper, you should order something else. I appreciated his honesty, because I was not interested in having steak with my peppercorns:) and I like (actually expect) my waiter to steer me in the right direction if I'm going to order something less than appetizing."}
{"text":"I've only ate here once but the experience was very good.  We went during a week night in the evening with about 8 people and no reservation.  The place was pretty busy considering it was a week night.  Soon as we walked in we were seated --there was no wait for adjusting tables, etc..

The overall service was great.  Both drink and food orders were taken very promptly and the food was also brought out in a very reasonable amount of time, especially considering there were 8 of us.  Drinks were also refilled very promptly without having to bug the waitress.

I ordered the mash potatoes and filet /blue cheese, and side salad.  The steak was cooked just as I asked and was very tasty.  The potatoes and salad were nothing off the norm, but they were also very tasty.

This was a great experience coming here; however, I felt it was quite overpriced for the food you got.  Yes, the food was very good, though for the price it costs it really needs to be.

If I had a choice of 'anywhere' I wanted to eat, this probably wouldn't be on my short list.  If I was asked to go back, I would, but I wouldn't make the suggestion myself."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge servings, so plenty for leftovers. Vegetables were cooked perfectly! Sesame crusted salmon was divine. Service was wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I went with my Mom and Sister for a lunch on Saturday.  The decor in this location is so fun & inviting.  I like how the bar is illuminated with colorful bottles lining the wall and that the whole bar area is separate from the restaurant.  The ladies who greeted us were so warm & friendly.  The restaurant is really up to date and has a trendy look to it with some of the seat backs lined with colorful pillows.  The walls are lined with wine bottles and you can see the chefs preparing the food behind a glass wall in the kitchen.  Service is top notch and food was delicious.  Coffee is excellent here!!!  Can't wait to take my Husband!!"}
{"text":"An all around great restaurant.  The wood burning fire place is so inviting when you walk in.  Food and service are exceptional and consistent every time.  We have been going for years and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Really good food and ambiance. Great for business meetings or dinner with the spouse."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time tonight as they are participating in Charlotte's Queen's Feast. I was impressed with the number and variety of selection on their prix fixed menu, as well as the portion and quality of the food. 

We sat next to the wood grill and could see and smell the steaks cooking over the open flame. Our server was great. Timely, but not intrusive, if that makes sense.

Save room for dessert! One portion is enough to share and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Back again last night and no disappointments. Everything was great. Started with happy hour apps in the Bar (table was way too small for 4 people)  food was yummy. Tenderloin sliders, cooked to order with ahi tuna and sesame crackers and some chicken tenders. Drink were perfect. Then in the restaurant for steaks and BLT salad. Service ve 5 star,and food 5 star."}
{"text":"Ordered \"to-go\" from here on Friday. The place was busy, we weren't exactly sure where to order from but were sent to the bar and then told someone will come and take our order. That's how it works, you don't order from the bartender or the hostess. 
We got the tenderloin salad ($15) and the 14 oz NY strip (30$)- this came with a side and we added another side (mashed potatoes and mushrooms). 
It took quite a bit to get our food, but that's expected at a real restaurant like this. 
Taste= really good, price= kinda pricey but we were stuffed beyond belief
Overall= I think this is a great place to go if you have some extra cash and want a great meal."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and great service! Can't ask for more!! Gotta try out half priced wines  every Monday! Wood grilled salmon is my favorite, and for dessert the crime brûlée cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Love their salmon and bread. The blt salad is good but a little pricey as an add on. South west potatoes are sooo good"}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. I enjoy the dessert more than anything else on the menu. My low rating is a reflection of poor, and at times rude service. Went out with a few friends for some drinks and dessert. It was around 9PM so we were seated immediately. Our server was young, and it showed. He started off by discussing how ready he was to get off work so he could go out and party. To make things worse, he then rushes us through our drinks and dessert. He dropped off our check while we were still finishing dessert and we never saw him again.

Unfortunately, I have had poor service at the bar too on separate occasions."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today for the first time with a group of coworkers. It was amazing. The service was great we had 3 amazing servers that took great care of us. Everything came out perfect and in a very timely manner but at the same time not rushed. We had the lobster queso app as well as the coconut shrimp, both were outstanding! People ordered variations of pastas and steaks and salmon, I had the key lime butter salmon with a crab cake and sweet potato waffle fries as well as a BLT side salad (don't judge we were celebrating anyway) everything was cooked to perfection and full of flavor and you could tell how fresh everything was. I didn't have room for dessert but I wish I had it looked to die for. 

Parking is easy they have a semi private lot. Good for groups but I can tell they get extremely busy. A little on the pricy side but totally worth it."}
{"text":"We had a large family group of several generations. And I think everyone was happy with both food and service. Our server was a delight at all aspects of her job. We all enjoyed a wide variety of foods, from salmon atop salads, portabella sandwich which was mouth watering so many dishes, so many smiles! Although the hostess acted as though it were difficult to seat us. That bad vibe was smoothed out by the pleasant greeting and attitude of our server. This is our local but not our fave Firebirds, not as much fun as the Greenville,Sc location. But it was worth the visit.."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here with my wife. We have enjoyed both visits. The food was excellent and the staff was friendly and attentive. We made reservations both times and were seated right away. I would recommend Firebirds to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped with the family for a Sunday lunch while in town.  Very, very nice place. Our servers where great.  I believe her name was Charleen and she was perfect.  We had 6 adults and 4 children ages 2 - 6 with us.  When the children's order arrived at the table, she noticed my wife take the Oreo cookie off the first plate that was set down.  She then removed the cookie's from each plate and gave them to my wife so the kids didn't see their treats before they were done eating.  That shows me they look for the little things to make your visit the best they can.  Thanks again and we will see you the next time we're in town!!  

Oh, and I had the Salmon and it was great!!"}
{"text":"A special treat as it's a little pricey but love the gluten free options!  The ambiance is really nice as well.  When I've been short on time we eat at the bar."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have lunch or dinner. The hubby and I have gone to this location on numerous occasions and each time we never leave disappointed. I've tried the Delmonico steak sandwich which was really wonderful. I was worried that steak wouldn't work in a sandwich but much to my surprise I was delighted with the food. I've also tried the fish taco's and I was worried about them being too spicy. Our server was more than happy to make sure the sauce was on the side for me. This is one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Food is excellent, especially the ranch rings appetizer. Their spicy chicken pasta is delicious and service has mostly been good. Be sure to make a reservation or you may be waiting awhile."}
{"text":"Salads, seafood, deserts, and the lemonade....wonderful.  I take my clients, referral partners, prospective employees, etc because I know the service, the food, the atmosphere.  All the best reasons you select a restaurant for a business luncheon.  Then it all that and more for special occasions.  I have never had an average or less than enjoyable meal at Firebird's Wood Fired Grill."}
{"text":"Sesame Salmon was ok and so were the mashed potatoes but the side of fried spinach was completely pointless, tasteless and very oily. Will come back to try other items though"}
{"text":"The service here was good. Our server was on point by coming around at the right time and making sure we were OK and never had an empty drink. The reason they are getting 2 stars is for the food. I ordered the cilantro chicken and what I got was 2 frozen patties that looked like something you would get from McDonald's , smothered in a heavy cream sauce. For the price, I would expect better quality food.

My recommendation would be to go to another restaurant for the money. Charlotte has better options for what you spend at this place."}
{"text":"6/17/17
Had a great lunch today and the cute very small bartender whose name I forgot to get was Excellent
Really took care of the people at the bar as well as people at tables in bar area and outside patio
Food was great 
One glitch was when my food was brought out by what I found out a new waitress it was not mine and I asked her 2x's if this was what I ordered and she said yes!
I ordered Del Monaco steak sandwich less bun with fries and she brought me a cheeseburger no bun with fries!!
Then I showed my plate to bartender and she got me the. correct food
I understand being new but after asking 2x's the new waitress should have said she would check with chef not leave plate and hurry away
I will go back because the food is great and usually the service is great also"}
{"text":"6/15/18
Had a Great dinner here last night
The filet was excellent and cooked to perfection
My companion had the sirloin steak salad which was also excellent
We each ordered a glass of wine and waitress asked if we   
wanted a 6 or 8 ounce glass of wine I noticed on the menu the 6 ounce was $12 however when I got my check the 8 ounce was $16 that just seemed a little high to me Our waitress was very good server we had a great time we will gladly go back it's just I certainly didn't expect to pay for $16 for one glass of wine usually we buy a bottle however we were going to the movies and the  bottle wouldn't of been practical 
All in all this is a very good restaurant 





Had a complaint last time and this restaurant took care 
of it in a very nice professional way thank you 
Went back today and had the Colorado chicken salad 
and it was Great and had a ton of chicken with a excellent 
flavor and fresh lettuce and was Great !
They know how to take care of their customers and make you happy about retu"}
{"text":"It was a rainy Saturday night when we decided to visit Firebirds, so obviously the place was packed. We ended up waiting at the bar, which was quick and efficient.

We then got our table and were really happy with our server. Good service is always a plus in my book.

For dinner we chose the Pepper Crusted Sirloin & the Filet Mignon. Both tasted GREAT (even considering that we had to send the Sirloin back, as it was a bit too pink for us)!

Great Food + Great Service = Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Service is great, wine list is vast and hanger steak was so delicious, so tender. Mac and cheese was also phenomenol"}
{"text":"Visited Firebirds, at Northlake mall on a Monday and was overall pleased with my visit. I have visited this location in the past for celebration dinners and have enjoyed myself before. The restaurant is dimly lit with patio, bar and dining room seating. The wood fire grill is dining room facing and I assume the rest of the kitchen is behind that , so it's kind of neat to be able to see the chefs working on everyone's food ( if your table is closer to that side of the dining area). 

This visit the serving team was very prompt. We were met immediately by someone to get our drink order and she informed us that Monday is the day for wine specials ( 1/2 price glasses and bottles I believe). Then our food server brought us our drinks and took appetizer and entree orders . 

My husband and I ALWAYS get the buffalo wings when we come here , because they taste as good as they look ( see picture attached ). The bread they serve is also very delicious .  This visit I ordered a salad with chicken, cranberries , goat cheese , nuts and a tasty vinegrette. I highly recommend asking for the dressing on the side when you order. My husband ordered an end-cut piece of....cow??? ( I don't eat a lot of beef so I'm not so sure of the term, but he's says it's tender and juicy). His entree came with a dipping special sauce for the meat and a baked potato. 

Great place for date night, to grab a drink after shopping in the mall, family celebration, graduation dinner etc ."}
{"text":"Ill start off by saying I do not want to leave this review because I have happily dined at Firebirds near a dozen times before, which is a lot for my income/age range.

I took my new girlfriend there for the first time last night 4/20/17 while saying that it is a great place. I love the fresh lemonade in a sugar rimmed glass and the Pepper encrusted steak.

We had a 10 minute wait to be seated, which wasn't normal for the time on a Thursday but neither of us minded at all. Once seated we were greeted by our server who was training another server (she was awesome for being in training). I ordered the lemonade and my date was not given much time to look over the menu before being asked if we just wanted waters to start. I had not even had a moment to look at the drink menu which had been with our server. I was looking for the Double Black Diamond Martini which I didn't see on the table cards or food menus which we were already given. I thought it was strange we didn't see a drink menu until after we had ordered our waters/lemonade. Also, we never received straws for our drinks throughout our stay.

I ordered a Double Black Diamond Martini and asked for Bread. I had finished the lemonade and moved the glass to the far end of the table, expecting to sometime soon get a refill offer or the Martini I ordered or the bread I asked for!?!. I do not know exactly how much time had passed but I was irritated, looking around and trying to make contact with our server. My date asked if I just wanted to leave but I did not want to accept poor service and leave to find another place to eat. Finally I got up and asked the trainee if I could get the drink and bread I ordered. While I was up I went to the restroom if nothing more to give the server additional time. When I came back my lemonade was not refilled nor did my date say that it was offered but I did have my Martini waiting.

Bread came shortly before the meal arrived and I was offered a refill on my lemonade and if I would like another Martini (I had finished it already) which I declined. Once the meal arrived my date asked for her own strawberry lemonade, both of them came back about the same time. 

I was only able to eat about half of my steak before I asked to have it boxed up due to having a headache and not feeling well. I would have written something last night but I only wanted to get to bed and sleep off how I was feeling.

Overall I think I was very disappointed with this visit and it has left a bad vibe for me and my date who was there for the first time."}
{"text":"My personal favorites:

The fresh and crusty bread, served with real butter
The house martini! $10.00
The ginger/mango mojito! $10.50
The aged rib-eye, comes in three sizes (I got the 14 ounce)--have it cooked rare to medium rare. Any more done than this I think is overcooking a perfectly fine steak. The 14-ounce ribeye was $26+

So, for the food I think it deserves a 4+
And for the atmosphere, a 5 easily. It's very nice and inviting inside, and none of that snooty ambiance and attitude that I have come to associate with some high-end steak restaurants that I've been to. Besides, there's A Nordstrom in the same area, as well as an Ethan Allen across from the restaurant.

I am not sure if the Firebirds is a chain and if it is, that would be my only quibble since I would very much prefer to go to smaller and local places. 

All in all, my hubby and I had a very pleasurable dinner here, and we would go back for the ribeyes, of course!"}
{"text":"Seems I posted this review on the wrong restaurant therefore I will start over.   This is for Firebirds Wood Fired Grill.  We ate there on 01/09/16    We had a reservation for 715 got a text at 645 stating our table was ready.   We got there at our reservation time and had to wait 40 minutes.   The waitress was good but after we got our food she disappeared, one person in our group ordered their most expensive steak medium rare , it came out rare.   The waitress took the plate back to the kitchen and came back with the same steak well done.  The right thing to do would have been to bring the customer another steak.   Took forever to get our 360.00 bill, we will NOT go back."}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal (onion rings to start, new york strip medium, loaded baked potatoe, and garden veggies) and fabulous service (thanks Amy for a great dining experience!).  We keep going back when the craving for cow hits us hard!!!"}
{"text":"Some friends called while I was in the grocery store Saturday night and asked me to meet them there for dinner.  That changed my plans significantly for the evening.  Good thing I had not already picked up the salmon I was planning on.  Arriving about 6:30 you would never know there was a recession in progress.  Firebirds shares a lot with 3 other chain restaurants and I had to circle the lot a couple of times to find a spot.  Without reservations we were quoted 40 minutes which turned out to only be about 25.

Courtney, our waitress, was on top of her game.  She was right there with iced tea refills and knew the answer to every question we asked except one allergy related question and she was back quickly with that answer.  The folks next to us had a small child and she made sure the apps hit the table fast to keep the child, who was a perfect angel the whole time, busy and happy.

All of us were very happy with our food except for one minor thing.  I had ordered my blue cheese filet medium and it came medium rare which will quite often leaves the middle too chewy for my liking.  I pointed it out to the waitress and she immediately offered to take it back and cook it some more and in another minute the manager was there with the same offer.  As it worked out it was acceptable for a couple of reasons; it was a good piece of meat to begin with and because I had not yet finished my salad it got to sit a bit before I cut it open.  So I would not let them take it back.  They did insist on my taking a dessert to go and I got the creme brulee cheesecake which I used for a delicious lunch the next day.

Inexpensive this place isn't but it was an excellent dinner.  The service was great.  While they were quick to get stuff to the table I noticed they were not rushing couples that wanted to linger over coffee either."}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite at the bar. We ordered the Jalapeño Deviled Eggs and Seared Ahi Tuna. Great service, amazing food, cold beer and their Double Black Diamond drink is delicious! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the Double Diamonds. Our server Steph was superb, she has a great sense of humor, an excellent feel for her job and the company she works for, she definitely has managerial potential.
We tried the sliders, fantastic.
We tried the chicken strips, superb.
We tried the pretzel, good but needs more sea salt on the outside.
Don't pass up happy hour especially the Double Diamonds"}
{"text":"Mark me down as unimpressed.

We went on a late Summer evening, arriving about 6:30. The inside was a wait, but the outside was available, and for good reason: The outside pilars and ground was crawling with some sort of beetle infestation. They weren't poisonous or anything, but when we ate we could see them through the metal lattice table, strolling on the underside of the tabletop.

Our server was very good, but the kitchen staff was not. My wife ordered a shrimp salad with \"light dressing\", something the server repeated back to us from the order she had written down, and the salad arrived, soaking in salad dressing.

When the server came back to check on us, my wife mentioned that the salad was swimming in dressing. Our server immediately said she'd have the kitchen make a new one with light dressing. About 5 minutes later, the manager arrived with a new salad, with lettuce on top lightly dressed. Problem solved.

Or so we thought. It turns out, the kitchen staff had simply placed new lettuce on top of the salad my wife had originally had. When she got past the new layer on top, there was her old salad, still awash in salad dressing.

The manager returned, and offered another, new salad. My wife declined, saying that she was full at this point from the earlier appetizer and the lettuce and shrimp she had eaten from the first two iterations of the salad and couldn't possibly eat a third. Nonetheless, the manager returned about 5 minutes later with another salad, which we wound up taking home--she didn't really want it, but there was no sense leaving it behind, even though she said at the time they didn't need to make it.

A measure of a good restaurant is how it deals with mixups and mistakes like this. I confess, I thought the restaurant would have taken the salad off the check--we had ordered an appetizer, my meal and a couple of glasses of wine, so there was still a tab to be paid. But when the check came, the salad was on it. In their eyes, I suppose, their three attempts to get a simple request right was sufficient effort.

As for what I had...I have no recollection of what it was. That is how forgettable it was. I think it was a pasta dish. I know I was eating most of it alone, as my wife's food was off the table twice in the attempts to get her order right.

This restaurant clearly has pretensions of being an upscale dining experience. From what we saw, it has a long way to go before it can claim to have reached that goal. Both of us spent a lot of time that evening looking across the patio to the seating for Cantina 1511, wishing we had walked in their door instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I could not have picked a better place to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The staff was awesome the food was wonderful and the manager made sure to stop by and see that everything was right. There is something for everyone on the menu. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely will come back.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted very warmly and the service throughout our whole dinner was awesome.  Great manners and nice staff.  Not to mention the food was awesome.  The kids really enjoyed their meal also.  Very satisfying for all tummies."}
{"text":"Food here is always !  My third year for choosing this place for my birthday dinner with my husband.  I love the cabin-like feel of the place, including a fireplace.  Our waiter was great and very attentive.  The Manager also checked in on us a couple of times.  Their menu selections make my meat eating (by that I mean steak!) husband happy as well as my salad options! The bread they serve after you order is fresh baked yumminess.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you to our server Marissa, and the manager for making this experience great for us and going above and beyond for our family. The service at this location is impeccable."}
{"text":"***DON'T*** GO TO CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY.  I was floored! $135 in food for 4 people to celebrate my husband's B-day and they don't do anything, we would have gone to the Black Angus or CARVERS they are near the same area, just as delicious steaks *and* less money $!!  At least at those places we would get a candle in a brownie just so we could say that we had him blow out a candle for his b-day.  I can't justify $28 entries that do not come with a soup or salad in this economic climate, and NO hospitality, so even though the food is good we won't be returning because we really only go for special occasions go to Carvers or Black Angus or even Outback! Before we return here!"}
{"text":"Thai place has something for everyone. My husband and I have had every item on the menu and it's always good. Friendly staff and great bar area. Happy Hour here has a great menu. Love the kitchen in the back where you can see what's being cooked."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we go here & me being unfamiliar with the name of this restaurant &  what they offered and since I'm not exactly a Charlotte native...I wanted something different and thought it would would be cool to go with someone else tastebuds so,  I went with what my friend suggested. 
And I must admit it was as pleasant experience dinning here. 
On my visit there was no wait in line, the atmosphere was perfect, we had the best seat in the house by far...we sat at the north side of the bar at a table right next to the fire place...perfect for a romantic date. There were 3 friendly gentlemen which one I noticed must of been one the managers who was sitting right next to us...while he chatted with friends that came in. The atmosphere, customer service , food and drinks were outstanding. While I'm not a steak person...next visit I will indulge as there steaks and potatoes looked very tasteful.
As my friend chatted with our waitress I overheard that the owner of this restaurant maybe the owner and/or has/had ties with Longhorn. No wonder I got the Longhorn feeling but, on a Ruth Chris setting."}
{"text":"Found by accident, but really impressed.  Kobe meatloaf will bring me back.  Also the parmesan mahi very good.  Ate at bar and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and when we had one small problem they treated us fantastic. Our server Ashlee S was very good!"}
{"text":"Apparently Firebird's is a chain that I haven't heard of before, but I was pleasantly surprised when we went there for a business dinner tonight. 

FOOD
* Appetizer: Lobster Spinach Queso - FANTASTIC. You can really taste the lobster in the cheese dip. The tortilla chips that come with it are just aite. 
* Appetizer: Onion Rings with ranch dressing - classic. It's got a nice crunch and the ranch dressing goes well with all that is fried. 
* Wood Grilled Salmon - really nicely cooked salmon that is crispy on the edges, firm on the outside, and tender/moist in the middle. Came with DELICIOUS parmesan mashed potatoes with pieces of the potato skin adding a nice texture to the creamy mashed potatoes. 

ATMOSPHERE
* Reminds me of a mix between a pintrest elegant ski cabin with dark woods and grey rocks, a seasons 52, and a pinch of Cheesecake Factory. So.. quite nice.
* Slightly too noisy to be able to hear the person across the table. Had to raise my voice a bit.

SERVICE
* Disorganized. One waitress came to get our drink order and share the dinner specials, then another waiter came and did the same thing. Even though we had two waiters, they still managed to skip over taking down someone's drink order. Overall, service was slightly awkward. 

RANDOM
* Plating was awkward. It seems like they just put the food on the plate in clumps. The presentation was not very appealing. Some plates were too big for the amount of food on it. 
* It was happy hour when we got there, meaning cocktail drinks were only $5. Win!"}
{"text":"Five star lunch! Professional courteous staff! It was my first time so I ordered a spinach salad  & the Durango burger!  ....both were very large servings & absolutely delicious servings. The hamburger was cooked to perfection and I'd rate it a 10!  I had Alex's Fresh Squessed Lemonade wow! Refreshing! Unfortunately, I didn't leave room for dessert! 
Staff here are professional,  know when to interject & understand guests may be conducting business.  We left happy with our choices and Firebirds is my new favorite restaurant for lunch!"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for a conference and went here on Monday night for dinner. Amazing New York Strip Streak. Had to come back Thursday night for filet mignon. Best streak I've had. Oh, and great bread."}
{"text":"Came here for my sisters birthday dinner. It was a good time. My sister got the coconut shrimp dinner with a side lobster tail. She said it was all great.

My other sister got some kind of a chicken dinner with mashed potatoes. Her potatoes had cold spots throughout them but she said the chicken was good.

I got the prime rib and it had the potential to be good but it was cooked to well. I told our waiter that I liked it really pink and he said to order it medium then. It came with no pink but it was tender along the outside. The middle was dry and chewy. The horseradish cream was really really good. 

I will give this place another try but I would send my dinner back next time if they did not cook the meat how I asked. I'm sure if I had said something they would have taken care of it. When your out to dinner for a celebration you just don't want anything to spoil it though."}
{"text":"Inconsistent food, but mostly so, so. 

On several visits, they couldn't get the steak temperature correct. 

I ordered wine and received the half glass but was charged for the full. I prefer not to argue. That was our last visit. We went there probably five times before giving up on them."}
{"text":"Delicious as usual. Steak prepared perfectly and our meal was properly paced. Our server got a little busy with a large table, but her coworkers stepped up and took care of us. Great meal. 

Dined 1-28-14 at the Stonecrest location"}
{"text":"Prime rib was very very very good! After going to the kings kitchen this place firebirds was great! Shall keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin with this place? 
First off, the atmosphere is everything you would expect, very friendly staff, the food is out of this world, the decor is everything you would want, and the food is amazing!!! (I know I already stated that).
I ordered a cocktail red sangria and it was very smooth and I loved the bite size fruits I enjoyed after my drink. 

I was contemplating between the New York strip or the delmonico and I ended up ordering the delmonico medium well and it was so buttery and tender and juicy and I'm getting hungry again writing this post. 

The complimentary bread and butter is something so simple and what 95% of restaurants serve but they have a special kind of fresh warm sour dough complimentary bread. Absolutely amazing! 

Overall, YOU SHOULD TRY THIS PLACE! Promise, You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Always quality and the service is outstanding.  The salmon is incredible and they the steaks are awesome.  They are always accommodating if you want to split a meal. Everything will come out on a separate plate if you wish.  Good wine list and the like.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"*sigh*

- do not sit at the bar for dinner
- make sure the waiter listens to you and has the right order
- pricey food

We sat at the bar since there was a long wait for the regular tables.

Started off with smoked chicken wings, asked for ranch - instead got blue cheese! The wings were alright, nothing to rave about.

I love French baguettes! The bread that was given to us as a starter was warm and good.  The salted butter complimented well with the bread.

Prime rib was actually mediocre. It had some flavor, but it just needed just a tad bit more. I loved the au jus more than the meat itself. It was a let down.

Overall, I am not pressed to come back. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to bring friends to drink at the bar. The food, meh, I pass."}
{"text":"The first thing I thought when I visited this place for the first time during lunch was WOW. The interior is fantastic. It's like you're stepping into another world that's very clean and cozy. Loved the interior decor. 

Service was phenomenal. My server kept checking up on me to see if everything was okay. I didn't have to ask for much since everything was taken care of in good time. 

The food was just alright. I've only eaten here once for lunch, and the free bread was piping hot and super-soft. Very very tasty. I don't remember what I ordered, but the only thing I remember is my side of fried spinach was way too greasy and it felt gross inside of me. 

But besides, that, GREAT experience!!! I do recommend it at least a few tries."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinners very much. The food was great and the staff was very attentive. I had prime rib which was absolutely delicious and cooked just as I asked. My husband had the rib eye and the BLT salad. My daughter had the filet. We all enjoyed and will definitely make a return trip."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here to take advantage of their buy one get one free Veterans Day special. We were both so glad we did! We started off with an appetizer of their coconut shrimp and slaw. It was simply amazing! The slaw was a perfect accompaniment to the crunchy and slightly sweet shrimp. I opted for the bacon wrapped filet mignon with Parmesan mashed potatoes. My steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were smooth, velvety, and had the perfect combination of butter and cheese. Hubby went for the Chili encrusted Delmonico steak with a loaded baked potato. His steak was also cooked perfectly and I couldn't resist stealing a couple bites of his baked potato. Oh so good! We were too full for dessert but our interest was piqued when we saw the bartender making a cocktail out of a container that was filled with sliced pineapple. When she told us that it was their famous martini we just had to try one. And so glad we did! Simply delicious and very refreshing! This was our first time here but I can honestly say that it will not be the last. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner expecting a long wait so my husband and I sat for drinks while we waited to be seated. The martini selection was good, I have the pomagranite martini and my husband had the firebird (not sure of the name but it had a bird on the side of the glass). Service was good and food was good too. I had the sesame crusted salmon and ate all of it. This was our second time there and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"4th visit & again on point. The cuts of beef here are top of the line. I had the Aged Ribeye medium rare.  Perfect temperature & whatever they my rub it with is phenomenal. Dad had the prime rib & he was more than satisfied. The house made Caesar dressing is amazing. I wouldn't have ordered the Tenderloin trio appetizer if I knew I was getting steak but trying the different ways they prepare their meat was a great way to decide once you get the full menu. Cassie makes an incredible Cosmo & is so attentive I felt like we were the only ones at the crowded bar. Christian is a great conversationalist all while hustling out drinks all around the bar. Looking forward to my 5th visit. No room for dessert. The only thing they could do better is have a cappuccino machine."}
{"text":"I always forget to review this place!
I've gone for dinner 4 or 5 times in the past 3-4 yrs which makes it about once a year...definitely good enough to return (we went last Friday night) but I think the reasons I don't return more often are:
a) a bit pricey ($5 for a side of mushrooms is kinda crazy)
b) menu is pretty limited and nothing is spectacular or even unique
c) there are so many other restaurants--especially in that Chandler Mall area--that something else always wins out

That being said, I've never had a bad experience. Steaks/Prime Rib have always been cooked exactly as I ordered and the Salmon is wonderful too. Wish the dinners came with a vegetable or salad as well as the potato but, alas...

Service has always been attentive and the hosting staff never snotty. Like the dimly lit lodge look of the place as well.

Yes, I would recommend this place but with price/menu caveats mentioned above."}
{"text":"My family loves this place in Richmond, VA, so I was happy to give the Southpark location a shot.  There's nothing special here: it's a slightly upscale chain restaurant in an artificial \"urban\" shopping center.  That said, the food was pretty tasty on a tired Tuesday night.

I ordered the parmesan-crusted flounder with mashed potatoes and spicy pecan green beans.  Those beans were seriously good.  The rest of the dish played second fiddle but was still quite appetizing.  My wife had the wood-fired salmon with a loaded baked potato and it also received thumbs up.

The service was friendly but pretty slow; it took 10 minutes just to get him to return the check.  I guess other reviewers have noticed this as well.

I liked the place.  If I'm shopping in the area, I'll definitely consider it.  However, don't count on me driving over to Southpark just to go to Firebirds."}
{"text":"Very pleasant staff. We had a group of 10 and when two people couldn't attend, the staff kindly rearranged our table to have the remaining 8 of us all fit more intimately together at one round table. 

Menu has a good mix and variety of options from salads, meats, fish and appetizers. The side salad options are good portion- definitely try the side spinach salad if you like bacon, hard boiled egg and tomatoes. 

The baked potato was done just right and lightly salted. The simply grilled Mahi Mahi was fresh and grilled to perfection - slight grill marks on the outside and tend meat on the inside. 

Others in the group had filet, Prime rib (huge portion!!), sirloin and chicken. The crowd seemed pleased with their dishes. 
The staff was amazing at constantly re-filling up your drink! I think I had 5 club sodas during my meal! 

We sat inside, but the outside seating area looked private and cozy. There was also an enclosed porch area to dine that likely has heaters."}
{"text":"So I've been here 2x in the past few years [a lot considering I live out of state] because my aunt adores this place. I remember fondly my first dining experience, it was wonderful. The fish was quite amazing, but I couldn't remember what I'd had so I opted for the Aspen Sirloin & baked potato. My mom got the strawberry & shrimp salad to share at our table of 8. I honestly could've just eaten the salad itself (and a potato). My steak was amazing, but I just wasn't feeling it, I just wanted more salad!

We had reservations to sit outside but by the time that rolled around, the wind picked up and we knew it would be unbearable to sit outside... so our hostess got another inside table immediately for us. I felt bad for our intended server but she completely understood."}
{"text":"We visited last night for their steak special and was very impressed

Normally with specials they are small portions and leave you hungry walking out the door unless you drop twice the amount of the special price.

Our waitress was attentive and the food was good.  A tip make sure that you make a reservation as during the dinner hour the wait even during the week can get upwards to 35-45 minutes.

Will visit this location again"}
{"text":"My dining mates and I enjoyed everything about Firebirds. The food was excellent, plated nicely, good portions, seved hot. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The coconut shrimp was tender and not greasy with a delicious sweet tropical  sauce. My prime rib was cooked to perfection  with a creamy horseradish sauce  and my dining mates strip steak also cooked to perfection. The salmon was tender and moist also topped with a wonderful sauce . I ordered mushrooms in port sauce as a side for a potato substitute, very delicious.
 We would definitely return for another  enjoyable dinner"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service. I had the Parmesan Crusted Mahi, mushrooms and sautéed spinach and all were fantastic.  The shrimp quest sip was to die for as well.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, hubby and I ordered Firebirds for takeout. I picked it up and headed home. One of the entrees had bacon in it, even though we had requested NO bacon multiple of times. The manager who spoke to us was very kind and made a new dish, promised he'd refund the money because it was their fault (and it was, the order receipt also stated NO bacon). We never got the refund. Two weeks later, as we are in the area, we ventured in. The manager made us wait 45 MINUTES as he was \"trying to locate the order\" in their system. I had paid with a credit card and had proof. 45 minutes later, he tells us he cannot locate the receipt but will continue looking into it. At this point, I would expect the full amount to be refunded (nearly $70). Few days later I get a brief phone call from a different manager who tells me he has located the receipt on their end and will refund the entree. $19.76 refunded, really?! It took nearly 4+ weeks to get this ordeal cleaned up. We would have never wanted a refund if it was not first initiated from the manager. Why even say something that you cannot fulfill? In other words, we will never be back."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place.  Their black Diamond martini is amazing.  I've had practically everything on their happy hour menu and have never been disappointed.  Their tenderloin trio is amazing.  Service is great. I'm becoming quite the regular here."}
{"text":"Do and don'ts of Firebirds:

Do go to the bar and enjoy tasty adult beverges.

Do order the Desert Pear Margarita.

Do make a resevation.

Do not use the call ahead wait line system, it does not kick in until you actually check in, it is not a substitute for a reservation.

So, thank you and kudos to Christine Majonica who turned a frustrating situation and turned it into an unexpected treat.

The food was tasty, the service was top notch and well worth going to, as long as you have a reservation."}
{"text":"This restaurant has it all, great location, service, food and drink selections.  We decided to stop in on Saturday afternoon, the food was excellent and service was outstanding.  Chris the manager is very attentive he stopped by to check if our visit was going well."}
{"text":"I really enjoy firebirds. They can be a bit pricey at times, but the service and quality has been good to me. I've tried several items here. The lobster queso is pure greatness. The wings are a must try as well. Their deviled eggs were ok if you'd like something lighter. They also prepared my filet perfectly, but the grilled veggies were bland. I'd definitely go back just for a table full of apps!"}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out!

Just had lunch here with friends after church.  I'm not returning.
  
1.  Music was too loud!  How are we to converse?  It's not a Saturday night crowd, but a Sunday family time.  Awful!
2.  My salmon was EXTREMELY salty!  My husband said his steak also was  salty.  There's a difference between \"well seasoned\" and overly salty.  
3.  The zucchini slices were 3\" in diameter......awful!  Zucchini should be 5-6\" long and 1 1/4\"  maximum.  It should be for given to animals not to humans.  The chef should be ashamed.

We'll not be going back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to take my beau to Firebirds for months and I finally got a chance to treat him yesterday. Firebirds was everything I expected. 

I made reservations for 6pm for the two of us and there was absolutely no wait, especially since we got there early. Our waitress was really sweet. She had only been there a few days but was very prompt and sweet. 

We ordered the Sex and the Queen City martini and the Watermelon Margarita. Both were delicious and not very sweet. 

We ordered the chicken quesadilla, the prime rib, and the ribeye. The quesadillas came out very quickly. It was very fresh and had a southwestern kick to it which I loved. The prime rib and ribeye came out a few minutes after. We barely got a chance to finish our quesadillas. 

The prime rib was pretty massive. I didn't get a chance to finish it especially after stuffing my face with bread and quesadillas. It was cooked perfectly though and seasoned very well. I suggest getting the au gratin potatoes as well. They were delicious! 

The beau's ribeye was cooked perfectly. He enjoyed it very much. There was so much food he didn't even get a chance to tackle his loaded baked potato which looked phenomenal. 

There is absolutely nothing I can complain about about my experience at Firebirds. It was a lovely time and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The only negative thing I have to say is this place is really loud.  At 6:30 PM on Saturday night, the crowd noise was almost too loud to have a conversation across the table.  Bare wood beams and pillars with tile floors don't help dampen the noise.  Looks nice though.  Classic Rock music playing on the sound system only made the noise level higher - and I like Classic Rock.

I enjoyed a perfectly cooked chili rubbed Delmonico steak.  Great flavor but not much spicy heat.  It came with a southwestern potato gratin.  Very well prepared gratin that was spicier than the steak.   

Ordered a side dish of port mushrooms.  An easy dish to prepare, it contained fresh basil chiffonade that pushed it from good to great.  Throughout the dinner, there were little touches of cooking craftsmanship that are not often seen in most restaurants these days.

My wife and I split a Caesar dinner salad which was served on two chilled salad plates.  Each had a generous portion of shaved aged Parmesan cheese on top.  Another nice touch.  

Finally, we tried their chocolate brownie with salted caramel sauce.   Caramel sauce is actually easy to make but most restaurants buy the canned stuff.  This was scratch made sauce.   If you have ever tasted the real stuff,  commercial caramel sauce is pathetic.  This simple but great desert ended a wonderful meal.  

We were seated near the open kitchen.  It was interesting to see the cooks that were plating wearing gloves like they are suppose to.  The expediter was checking each steak that went out as well as tidying up the presentation.   

Attention to detail at every step really showed up in the food.  I am a classically trained cook and notice the details.  If you don't know how much work goes into preparing food properly, you will still enjoy the great results.

Our waitress was polite and attentive.  She actually knew what a Delmonico steak was (my question was a test).

This is not fine dining, but the food quality comes close.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Firebirds is a good restaurant to start a movie night (there is a large theater in the same shopping center). They have a great bar. Try the Double Diamond Martini. It is soaked in pineapple for 21 days. I always start with the Seared Ahi Tuna. The Chile Rubbed Delmonico hits the spot. If you are a big eater, they have lobster tail too. Leave room for dessert. I like their carrot cake."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have never been let down. The crab cakes are great,  steaks,  salmon... Never a bad meak...  The food is always perfect,  the service is outstanding,  great ambience....I appreciate that th servers make suggestions and very friendly. 

We went here for my birthday and I had the filet medallions with a wine portobello sauce with a green Chiles mac and cheese...OMG freaking DELISH and worth every damn dime. My boyfriend got the prime rib and swore it was the best he ever had. 

When the manager stopped over we ranted and raved about our server, Michael and how awesome our meal was and she offered us a free dessert.  When my boyfriend told the manger it was my birthday...my dessert came with a candle and the server created a card with highlighter markers and had all the staff sign the card....This place is one of my favorites but tonight showed me they ROCK! Super highly recommended"}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner with out of town guests.  We were seated immediately and our orders were taken shortly after.

The signature martini (made with pineapple infused vodka), was fabulous.  I had the sesame encrusted salmon, which was cooked to perfection.  The spinach salad was delicious.  However, I am not a fan of the fried spinach which was served with my entree.  

One member of my party did not care for his dish.  The manager came over right away and offered him another option or a credit for his meal.  He declined both, because he felt that the preparation was right, he just didn't like it. Besides he was enjoying my salmon and mashed potatoes!  He then ordered dessert, Key Lime pie which was excellent and even better, free.

I have never had a bad meal at this establishment and the wait staff is always attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"This is probably the nicest restaurant in the Northlake area. The menu is nice, but I find it just to be a tad on the pricey side. It's a nice atmosphere, but because of its proximity to the mall, the service can feel a little rushed. Overall the only word that comes to mind is, \"ok.\""}
{"text":"restaurant didn't seem to be that busy but it shouldn't take fifteen minutes just to get two lemonades and a water :/  

Placed meal in at 3:15 
took a 20 minute wait is alright 

Waitress isn't getting right simple things we are asking. Didn't seem to know much of what was going on not sure. 

The bread was okay but left crumbs everywhere 


Rates of this experience 1-10 
Mom said 6

{"text":"Filet mignon = yum-yum. Baked tater = yum-yum. Green bean = yum-yum too. Me likey. Yum-yum."}
{"text":"Bree, our server, was full of personality and on top of it!  Food was great!  We are visiting from out of town on business, and the hotel recommended this place when we asked about locally owned restaurants.  Our group had the Ribeye, Surf and Turf, Fire Grilled Salmon and the Prime Rib.  The Lobster Queso Dip was fantastic too!  Then, we rounded it out with tasty Key Lime Pie and Carrot Cake.  We had bunches of leftovers.  Everyone left happy and FULL!  Great experience!"}
{"text":"So we came here on a business trip and I was excited that we picked a place for steak.  I had the NY strip but prior to this started out with a martini at the bar.  Happy hour can be happy.  We were seated where I waited longer than I should have for bread I wouldn't eat because I am doing the low carb thing.  I had a glass of Cabernet but still waited a long time for the food order.  I finally ordered my strip asking for veggies only but they brought me some luscious potatoes anyway.  I protested and asked for all veggies again, such a shame to waste the mashed potatoes but my will power prevailed with only a minor taste.  The potatoes were good. The veggies were well, veggies. It kind of messes you up once you taste what you had tried to avoid but I am glad I did for the sake of this review that I did. So I say you should come here and give them a try but not with a large group.  It seems the service diminishes with more people.  If passing through Phoenix and in want of steak give them a try.  They do understand that medium rare is medium rare."}
{"text":"I took my husband here about a month ago for his birthday and I am not sure we will ever return.

It was a Friday night, so we assumed there would be a wait...but not an hour and a half.  We got to the restaurant around 7PM and the hostesses were too busy flirting with the other staffers and talking to each other to bother making a priority for their clearly busy dinner rush...They took my name and phone number and said we would get a text when a table was ready.  The girl said it would be about an hour and a half, but said it in a way that was like \"are you sure you even want to wait when you could go somewhere else...?\"  Having worked in a restaurant before, I know this is really poor etiquette for a hostess.  Your job is simple...smile, seat guests, smile, open the door occasionally...There were 4 girls crammed in the hostess stand and not doing anything.  Moving on from the poor first impression we got. ..

My husband and I went for a walk and planned to return back around an hour and ten minutes after waiting, which is what we did.  We went in and sat down on a bench near the hostess stand.  A couple walked in and the hostess offered to take them to the patio...uhh... if we knew this was an option we would have been sat already?!? So I went up and asked if we could sit on the patio instead of waiting.  The hostess seemed irritated and asked me to wait a minute.  Seemed like she forgot about us in the moment it took for her to get distracted by some gossip at the hostess stand...

We got sat out on the patio, offered some bread and drinks.  We got some appetizers, a salad, and some bread.  All was delicious and everything seemed to be getting better.  The table next to us included some ex-employees, which was obvious when everyone that worked there kept coming out to talk to them.  This is completely fine, but while you are on the clock and in uniform, you probably shouldn't be talking loudly about doing blow with guests in ear-shot.  We ignored it and kept to our own conversation and food.  We ordered some steak meals (both of us asked for medium steaks).  About 45 minutes after ordering...the food came out and my steak was cooked perfect...husbands was basically still mooing.  My potatoes were crusty like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.  Husband asked for steak to be cooked a little longer, they did. The manager came out to make sure it was cooked well and that was it.

Overall, the staffers, even the managers were unprofessional.  The food was mediocre at best (although the appetizers were really good).  The atmosphere was nice inside, but for the cost of the food, you would think they would be held to higher standards."}
{"text":"I've been many, many times and have yet to encounter even mediocre food or service. The setting is nice, but it can get loud during peak hours. They do always go out of their way to get it right.

Two can't miss menu items are the lobster-spinach queso and the Firebirds Chicken Pasta. Both are winners and usually my go-to selections.

Desert is a tad overpriced but if you sign up for their e-club you'll get $10 off your bill anyway, so go ahead and splurge. The creme brûlée is UH-MAZING. 

Firebirds is definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Your prime rib dinner is the best of any restaurant around. Keep serving it this perfect."}
{"text":"Staff and management are very nice and the food is usually well cooked. I think it's sort of pricy since two tiny small crab cakes that don't even equal one regular crab cake is 15 dollars, but if you're hungry and you know that their food is always going to be good and the staff always will be curteous then this is a great choice."}
{"text":"So I know Firesbirds is a chain but I've been eating at them for years now (even in Durham and Raleigh). Why? Consistency and quality of food is my main reason. They also seem to have a pretty high standard for the servers they hire as well. If you are ever unhappy with a dish brought to you, they will re-fire or replace it. Ever since I had a Chile rubbed Delmonico, I've been hooked.

Although I normally frequent the location at Rea Road, a couple of months ago this particular location reopened after a remodel and I had the opportunity to check them out. The large fireplace and seating area by the bar really draw you in; there's also a main dining room and patio seating. The signature cocktail, the Double black Diamond (a martini), is made with pineapple that's been soaking in vodka for a few weeks - it's high octane and delicious! (and only $5 during Happy Hour)

During the week there are \"bar bite\" specials and drink specials (and until 5 on weekends). The Jalapeno deviled eggs, Nashville Chicken Sliders and Sam Adams Beer Cheese (with pretzels) are the best ones.

Did I mention the portions? The Colorado Chicken salad (my favorite) is enough food for two people and the Ribeye Sandwich is pretty amazing.

If you sign up for emails, they will send you a coupon on your Birthday, let you know about special menu items and dinner/wine events."}
{"text":"Firebirds is consitent quality. Pretty good for a chain. My absolute favorite is the Colorado Chicken Salad. Love that it comes pre-dressed with the perfect amount of dressing. Pair that with a seasonal Sam Adams and I'm a happy camper. They have good appetizers; lobster queso and onion ring tower are pretty good. The creme brulee cheesecake with berry coulee is super yum. And of course burgers and steaks are good. Nice place for lunch in my opinion."}
{"text":"My salmon was cooked perfectly. Waiter was very attentive. I've been here twice now in the last 2 years. Will be back."}
{"text":"i wish they were closer to us we have to drive over 20 minutes so we don't go on that side of town very often. however when we do this is where we go. we were just there for my birthday last week :) the coconut shrimp is my favorite appetizer and for my main meal i ALWAYS get the firebirds chicken pasta. DELICIOUS!!! i have been getting this pasta since the day i tried it back in 2005 when my cousin introduced me to it. we came with a big group for our dinner before prom. the hubby likes the delmonico steak from here. wishing they would open a restaurant in scottsdale soon"}
{"text":"I did a 9 month project in Charlotte several years ago and this was my favorite place to eat.  I ate here about once a week for 6 or 7 months.  I grew up in Kansas and know what a good steak is and I think they have perfected a good steak.  

The place is very nice and I always had good service.  This would be one of the places that I would eat at if I ever make it back to Charlotte. 

They have added other restaurants around the country since I started eating there and I may have to find one and see if it is as good as the original."}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte, I had heard amazing things about this place. Was not disappointed !! Great service. Food phenomenal. My new must. Top shelf."}
{"text":"definitely wasn't in the mood to have steak until i got here. not too busy on a sunday night. i ordered the filet and shrimp. anything that has bacon wrapped around it is a winner. i heart bacon. my steak was perfectly cooked medium and it was a good size. the shrimp was a bit on the salty side...actually the whole dish was a bit salty for my taste. i got the fully loaded baked potato instead of the mashed and it was delicious. great service. all in all a very solid experience. =)"}
{"text":"Firebirds is one of my favorite date night places, and this night was exceptionally great!! My fiancé and I sat out on the patio in this beautiful weather, and had an appetizer (the pretzel bread and beer cheese is amazing!) followed by our entrees, and our server Laurin was amazing! Ask for her anytime you go to this firebirds location!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't think Firebirds is bad, I just really am not a huge fan of most of the menu items. Usually I just end up going with a chicken Caesar salad. 

I did, last time I visited, try their onion ranch rings, which were tasty. Their brownie for dessert wasn't bad either. 

The decor is just a typical smokehouse/tavern feel. It's kind of dark in there except for in a few areas. The bar is large and it looks nice. They have a huge variety of liquor.

Overall, I'm not opposed to going to Firebird's but I probably won't go out of my way to choose it over some other places."}
{"text":"I Had the 12oz. Ribeye, onion rings, and BLT salad. Everything was amazing. Steak was properly cooked (medium). We Came during the lunch rush. Service was great. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Okay, usually, I don't like chain steakhouse restaurants (ie. The Keg, Outback. etc), but I would have to say Firebirds is one of my favorite steakhouses by far. (both taste and price)

The services varies depending on the waiter/waitress, but food is very consistent. 

My favorite is their prime rib and fillet mignon. Also delicious bread (free!) is served. Good drinks as well (martinis)

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place has incredible food always but they just removed the coconut shrimp for some reason and that was a big mistake. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great steak, great service, great place to take my dad from out of town. Highly recommended for any after work happy hour or quiet dinner!"}
{"text":"Good food. Bad experience.

The good: The food was good. Well-cooked and tasty steaks. Pleasant service and a decent wine list by the glass.

The strange: I got a cocktail that was flat. I told the server. I did NOT ask for a replacement or for it to be taken off my bill. I discretely told the server to let the bartender know in case there was an issue. A manager came over (interrupting a conversation) to inform me that I must be mistaken, because HE tried the tonic water, and it was just fine. Well, thanks for telling me that I was wrong! 

I have tended bar, managed a bar and worked in the hospitality industry. As a paying diner, I LOVE being told that I am wrong! Thanks for letting me know that I must have IMAGINED my watery vodka & tonic! Next time I will know better.

BTW, the drink in question wasn't removed from my check. I was with guests so I just shut up, paid up and will vote with my wallet next time."}
{"text":"I love it here! 

The food is exceptional whether in the restaurant or at the bar. The atmosphere is fantastic and the service is as well. 

I've come here several times for business as well as personal occasions and have never been let down. It is definitely a place you will want to schedule a reservation for on weekends though, as the wait can become a bit long without one.
However, it is always worth the wait and a great experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went Wednesday night for my birthday dinner.  We had never been here before, but I had read a lot of reviews on Yelp and was really wanting to give it a try.  We were so glad we did!

We got right in and seated, we had Leah as our server.  She was very good and had a great personality.  Hubby wanted crab cakes for an appetizer but was worried about  getting filled up before dinner.  When Leah came to see if we wanted an appetizer, I looked at hubby and Leah started teasing him about what he wanted.  He went for the crab cakes, which we would split.  They were awesome, the sauce drizzled over them and the garnish slaw was incredible!  We almost licked the plate!  Oh, and the bread - butt bread as she called it (it DOES look like a butt!) was AWESOME!!!

For my entree, I had to select the Bleu Cheese Filet, so many had reviewed them on Yelp and I wanted to find out for myself how good it was.  As my side, I got the parmesan potatoes.  Hubby got the prime rib with southwest au gratin potatoes.  My steak was cooked to perfection - I like it medium rare, more to the rare side.  FABULOUS!!  It melted in my mouth and the blue cheese melted on top, was to die for.  Hubby's prime rib was also cooked perfect, also medium rare.  Not a lot of fat, tender and juicy - YUMMY!!  My potatoes were OK, nothing special.  His were much better, cheesy with some kick!  He out ordered me in the side dishes.  

For desert, which we took home, I selected the Key Lime Pie.  OMG....it was delicious!!!  Hubby chose the Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  Another winner!!!  Every item we selected Leah told us were their best sellers.  I told her I had read several Yelp reviews and I had made my choices based on the rave reviews.  We were both very impressed and will definately go here again on our next special occasion.  It is expensive, but it was well worth it.  Nice atmosphere, GREAT food, pleasant staff, you can't really ask for more when you want a special dinner out."}
{"text":"Great service great environment. 
The happy hour drinks were a great price. The double diamond pineapple drink was delicious but beware it is strong :) The waiter Tom was very patient, kind, and knowledgeable. He helped me select a great option the Filet Trio with shrimp: garlic mashed potatoes, steamed spinach, and shrimp on top of beef tenderloin. Absolutely delicious! My husband ordered pepper crusted  filet mignon with a loaded baked potato. He loved his meal as well both meat orders were tender and flavorful. This is a wonderful place to eat and the staff are great. We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, excellent service. Well staffed; waiters actually make eye contact with customers instead of looking pass them
 Seems like everyone is paying attention to your every need. Will definitely come back and highly recommend this restaurant and location."}
{"text":"Would be 2 stars for me but the cozy decor really helps the ranking.  I love the bar area and the fireplace found there.  Given a preference, I would always eat there in lieu of the regular dining room.

We dropped in for a late lunch and had salads that were fine.  The ahi tuna starter I had was actually pretty good and completed with a rosemary spice which I found to be refreshingly different.  

The service was a little all over the place.  I'm not sure if the bartender (our waiter) was just having an off day but he barely knew the beers on tap and seemed to forget about us after a while.  Again, it was an off hour for lunch so that might have been the overall issue."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Firebirds. The interior was clean and dark, reminding me of The Keg or a similar steakhouse atmosphere. The staff was very kind, and the customer service excellent. They had some good tunes pumped in as well. We jammed out some Boz Scaggs while dining.

As an appetizer, we had the coconut shrimp. They were cooked well, and were in a bed of unique citrus slaw, which was a hit at the table. The warm bread was also well received. The outside was crusty and the inside soft and buttery. My husband and I had the portabella sandwich; he with fresh fruit and me with tater tots (don't judge me) and a vegetarian black bean soup. The tots were hot and crisp. The fruit was, in fact, fresh, but was your normal fruit cup medley. The sandwich was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of balsamic - not too much to overpower. The rosemary focaccia was great, and absorbed the vinegar for a robust flavor. The vegetarian black bean soup was a bit too spicy for me, but packed tons of flavor. The first time around, I had to send it back because there was a giant unannounced ball of sour cream in the soup. I'm perplexed why one would list it as vegetarian, then drop a glob of animal product in there, which you find by surprise at the bottom of your bowl. I was disappointed in the ignorance of that menu move.

Our companions had the wood-grilled salmon with green beans and the pineapple chicken with garlic mashed potatoes. Both enjoyed their meals. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the beans fresh and al dente. 

Shared dessert was a warm carrot cake with warm caramel syrup. The piece of cake was huge... Definitely to be shared. The cream cheese frosting was utterly sinful. I had a cup of hot tropical green tea. They had a cute little box of Evolution tea. I enjoyed it greatly.

Lastly, I give huge props to our great server Aristotle. He was attentive and accommodating. He didn't split the bill like we asked, but that's not a big deal. My drink was always full, and an empty plate never stayed in the table for long. A replacement soup came fast and with apology, and leftovers promptly boxed and bagged.

For a party of 4, with meals, drinks, appetizers and dessert, the bill was around $150.

We felt thoroughly satisfied by our meal at Firebirds, and will certainly return in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary here with a delicious dinner. Our server was perfectly attentive. He was on top of things but not obtrusive in the slightest. I wish I could remember his name to give him kudos on here but its slipping my mind at the moment. The food was delicious and I thought the prices for the quality of food were very reasonable. The prime rib was awesome, which is hard to come by, and my husbands steak delmonico was wonderful as well. If you don't order the lobster queso dip then you are missing out. SO GOOD!  Not to mention all of the servers signed a card for us saying happy anniversary. How precious!"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday for my husband's birthday. what a great dinner we had. our server was very courteous attentive and suggested items from the menu based on our dinners what we might like. brought him a nice birthday dessert, but when they were packing up my leftovers dropped my dinner on the floor. they made up a new dinner plate for me to take home which we thought was fantastic. I had the Kobe meatloaf which was flavorful and light the Parmesan mashed potatoes and green beans were delicious. my husband had prime rib and said it was outstanding. our friends had center cut sirloin and there wasn't a piece left on their plates. highly recommend you try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Filet mignon was mouth watering. Server was polite and cheerful. It was one of our birthdays and they brought a card signed my several team members. Great experience."}
{"text":"I came here for Restaurant week and I was highly disappointed in our food.  I have visited this same location twice in the past for lunch and the food was superb.  I ordered the crab cake meal and the cakes came out hard, burnt and over cooked. I literally had to spit it out in a napkin.  My spouse ordered steak medium well and the server repeated.  It came out medium rare.  The manager offered to remake my meal but at this point, I no longer was hungry.  I did appreciate the Lobster bisque."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I usually get the strawberry and shrimp salad. The salad is pricey but it is delish. Service was average. But the few times I've been this place was packed."}
{"text":"Cam to eat here due to the reviews. They are GREAT here!! The service was fenomenal and the food was delicious. There was a delay with my food and they took great care of me. The server and the manager were very apologetic and went out of their way to make things right. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Went here during my lunch hour, food was excellent. There was an error with one of the condiments but the manager and the server went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. We didn't even ask for a manager. I highly recommend it and I will be going back. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to restaurants. The service is great and the food is even better."}
{"text":"I went to this location during lunch.  The food itself is pretty good,  not outstanding by any means but just solid, good food. I had the ribs, coconut shrimp, and crab cakes.  Ribs were a little burnt,  but everything tasted fine. I would have to say,  although very small the crab cakes were the best of the three.  For a mall restaurant, I love the interior. It was very warm and inviting...kinda reminds me of Bone Fish Grill's scheme on design. The only thing that bothered me was the lunch service.  I've been there during dinner and it was always great.  This experience left much to be desired. 

So my aunt flew in from out of town,  it was last minute and she wanted to have lunch and go shopping. It was also her birthday.  We decided to go to Northlake Mall because it was close to my house. Before she came over from the airport.  I called ahead and made reservations and even dropped off a cake at the restaurant before I  picked her up from Charlotte Douglas. I wanted to suprise her. The waiter was sweet but he looked lost and unorganized, he may need more training. Our water would remain empty for long periods without being refilled,  when food came it took forever to hunt him down for simple condiments such as ketchup for our fries,  and to top it off....when he dropped off the \"suprise\" cake,  he just left it on the table with 4 plates and left. How the heck do I cut the cake with no knife? Oh yeah how do we eat the cake with no forks? He forgot that too! SMH.....we had to flag down another waiter for what we needed. Took over 10min!!!!

He is lucky he had me as a customer because I was once a waitress in college so I was more understanding that sometimes you can have a bad day at work.  But I don't think I will be back anytime soon,  I was embarrassed that my Aunt had to sit through that experience."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. Half price wine, that could be a Monday thing,also had half price bar bites. Hamburger slider and grilled mahi tacos were excellent. Service was great also, poured or wine regularly, but not intrusive. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this one I've been to the one in Glendale and everything was great the one in Glendale they butterflied my steak well done I had no problems this one they said they couldn't do it and besides I had Montezuma's revenge after this meal!! Dont think i will return!!"}
{"text":"Firebirds was generous enough to donate food to our school for teacher appreciate week. It was absolutely delicious! We had the BLT salad, which was extremely tasty. I loved the salad dressing. I also had the chicken pasta, which was also delicious. I loved the applewood smoked bacon in the chicken pasta. I look forward to my husband and I going to their restaurant next time we are in Chandler. Thank you Firebirds!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice location. I went for dinner and they weren't too crowded. They had a long wait apparently get there early or make a reservation. The food was good and the service was nice."}
{"text":"Love the Prime rib, some
Of the best in the Valley.. very good wait staff, request Kenny when possible"}
{"text":"This place has awesome happy hours and Wine Down Monday is the best. The bartenders make awesome cocktails and the food is decent."}
{"text":"1. The food is great here. 2. The service is terrible. The service cancels out the good food in rating the dining experience.  It should be noted, that it is not the servers who have customer service issues, but the management! 2A. They are constantly surprised when they have a crowd. It seems to catch them extremely offguard and their response is to become snide and neglectful of their customers. 2B. They also will not seat you - no matter no matter how many open tables there are - until the kitchen has caught up with the orders. I thought that was very selfish of them. My conclusion: just order to-go. LOL!"}
{"text":"We visited on a cold and snowy night. Server was friendly but new therefore service was a bit rough around the edges. Everyone was satisfied with their meals however, my steak is advertised as a center cut and as you can see parts were inedible due the silver skin and sinew. It arrived pre sliced, what's that about. Their Key Lime pie is awesome..."}
{"text":"I've had really mixed experiences here. I've come here several times for lunch (with my white coworkers) and have been treated well. However, I came here once in the evening with my (Hispanic) husband and the hostesses were RUDE and treated us like lepers. I watched them seat several parties in front of us who came in after us, and when I inquired about it, they said they had reservations. Right then a male staff member walked up and affirmed - yes, they had reservations (without knowing who we were discussing, or why). I pointed out that, because I was sitting right by the hostess stand, I could hear them say they did not have reservations. The hostesses said they didn't know we would want to sit where the other parties were seated. WHAT?! That doesn't even make sense. I can accept that the hostesses just made a mistake, but to have *multiple* employees give the same defensive response, including the man who didn't even know the situation.... it just left a really bad taste in my mouth. We ended up leaving without eating, feeling pretty offended. 

I have eaten there with coworkers several times (when I didn't choose the spot, obviously), and the food is good but not necessarily anything above and beyond. The experience with my husband from several months ago has sort of ruined the restaurant for me."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.  My colleagues from out of town seem to gravitate to this place due to the location.

This place is jammed every time I have been.  Very popular place, probably thanks to its location in the North Lake Mall.  The decor and atmosphere are very nice.  It is a little loud. If you are looking for a semi-upper scale restaurant to take business clients to then this place works. 

Firebirds has a lot of steaks on the menu but I would not consider this a great steak place.  Just okay.  Steaks are along the lines of Outback or Lone Star quality.  They have lots of other menu items if you don't want steak.  My ribeye was tasty but not a great cut of meat.

Firebirds has a full bar (pretty normal these days) and a nice wine selection.  That said, not even the liquor could get me to add a star.  The service was very good so I got to give them that."}
{"text":"Very good food, just alittle on the expensive side. Atleast you get a decent amount of food for the money, service was kinda hit and miss but we were with a big party and were drinking alittle. LOL."}
{"text":"I have come to this location multiple times and it is usually busy but worth the wait the servers are always attentive if you come here be sure to try the BLT salad and the blue cheese fillet with the southwest potatoe au gratin it's the best thing on the menu"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses everything on the menu is good I've never really had a bad experience here"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from out of state and decided to try this restaurant out based on its good reviews.  We were a little disappointed.  I had a white sangria, the salmon with the mashed potatoes and veggies.  My husband had the prime rib with mashed potatoes. We were both underwhelmed.  The mashed potatoes were probably our favorite parts of the meals.  The rest, we agreed, was all pretty bland.  The service was okay, not terrific.  We ate several other meals in town that were much more flavorful."}
{"text":"Went to Firebirds on a Sunday night, around 8pm, just me & my brother, and sat at the bar.

We were greeted immediately at the door with a warm, friendly smile & given our choice of dining room or patio, but we chose to sit at the bar.

So glad they had Sam Adams seasonals on draught (i just missed the Cold Snap so got the Christmastime instead).

Our bartenders were Nathan & Katie and they were awesome! They weren't competing for our service, they had a nice, friendly tandem effect going on. Very informative, congenial, and not at all snooty or uppity.

From the reviews, i straightaway ordered the port mushrooms -- GET THESE! Soft, juicy brown buttons in a buttery port wine/au jus reduction. Paired awesomely with the beers.

To eat, we both ordered the 16 oz prime rib, med rare. Cooked perfectly (my steak *must* be red)! I also ordered the lobster tail as a side -- also cooked perfectly, soft n tender, not at all rubbery & over-cooked.

Sitting at the corner of the bar was an enormous glass jug of pineapple slices infusing in Svedka vodka. Apparently, this is their signature cocktail. Nathan hooked up free samples -- OMG! This was sinfully delicious & went down terrifyingly smooth!

I'm going back, but I want to go on a Monday for 'Wine Down Mondays.' Select wines are all half off.

It's a small corporate chain (i despise chain restaurants), but this has more of a lodge restaurant feel than a chain restaurant effect.

I'm going back again. When I get a bonus though, because it's pricey. (But *SO* worth it!)

(Take your lady here if you wish to dine finely & impress the girl!) Or treat your kid brother there like me, just a guys' night out.

{"text":"I have been to Firebirds twice now and both times the food and the service have been excellent. The first time was on Easter weekend. My daughter and I got dressed up and we felt right at home. Last week we went back. This time it was a party of four and we were dressed causal on a Thursday night. Again we fit right in. We went early because Firebirds offers a great early dinner meal from 4 to 6 Monday through Thursday. Everyone in the group was very pleased with their meal. The center cut sirloin is excellent. I also recommend the BLT salad. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations. A normal meal is a little more spendy than your average chain restaurant. The quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Make sure your license hasn't expired if you want to get a beer at this place. It doesn't matter if you've got a temporary license from the DMV, these guys won't serve you. Ridiculous. Makes sense that they had no wait on a Saturday evening at 7:45. Will never return."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place! I had the coconut shrimp as appetizers and they delicious. Then I had the Blue cheese Filet. Cooked to perfection. Even the manager or the chef (not sure)came to our table and asked if our steak was cooked properly. Then our waitress asked as well. The ambience was great and service was great. Pretty busy place and I can tell why, because this place is great. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of nine on a work trip. This place was recommended by a co-worker and I'm happy we came here.

Our waitress was super attentive, made great recommendations to the group regarding apps & main courses. I asked her to bring the group a good mix of the apps, and what great choices. Tuna, Shrimp, and Wings. For the main course I decided to take her up on the encrusted Prime Rib. The rest of my group ordered a mix of meats and fish.

Food didn't take too long to come out and let me tell you, everyone quieted down when the food came because it was very, very good.

My prime rib was done to perfection and I ate the entire thing.

Dessert choices were made...chocolate cake and pumpkin cheesecake.....recommendations again.....good ones!

Everyone left fat & happy. I would recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Firebirds in Arrowhead for 10 years now and they have just added in the last couple months the BEST beef and barley soup I've ever tasted along with their award-winning BREAD it is unbeatable. Try their Pecan crusted trout also five stars."}
{"text":"Well, I'll be honest: I was a little disappointed. I wish I had taken pictures but actually forgot.

I ordered the crab cakes with mango chutney and my wife got the peppercorn steak. The waiter, who was nice enough, asked if we wanted the steak \"butterflied\" which would reduce the time in half. We agreed. 

The wait was still close to 30 minutes or more for the two items.

Now, the crab cakes were good. And the chutney wasn't bad, but I think it was packaged so I don't know if I can rate it. It also came with a weird cabbage salad thing. This was very sour and I couldn't even finish it.

My wife's steak was overly seasoned and sorta dry. Now, I get it was a peppercorn steak, but the edges were crispy and dry.

Lastly, we ordered a warm brownie with ice cream hoping - just hoping - it would redeem some of the meal. And it looked good when we got it - but it wasn't warm at all. It wasn't bad per se but again, not warm as quoted. 

I feel like this place was trying too hard. I wouldn't say I hated it, but I don't feel ill be coming back soon. Especially for the price. I'll just go back to Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"At first when me and my girlfriend got to the restaurant the service was sub par. The hostess didn't open the door for us when we saw her open the door for everyone else. We had to wait for a table but that was fine. The only reason why we went too this place was because it is restaurant week so the desk wad not to bad. It came out to $30 a person. I ordered the steak kabob type deal and my girlfriend got the mahi which was the bomb. The streak wad ok but not as good as the fish. The waiter was good so we liked him. The desert was super good and the portion was so big we couldn't finish but that's a good thing because we like left overs for lunch the next day. Other then the beginning service we liked everything else."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here for lunch the other day and it was so-so. It looks like it should be much better. The locations pretty good parking was fairly easy and the decor of the restaurant is very nice. I had the ribs and they came out extremely charred. They were quick to replace them but the taste just wasn't there for me. We also had the coconut shrimp for an appetizer and they were little overcooked and I need to get very much for almost $12. To put this in perspective my main dish which were the ribs were only $12 as well. I do believe in giving places more than one opportunity to impress me so we will try it again hopefully it was just an off day."}
{"text":"If you want to spend a lot of money for a minimal amount of food this is the place to go. My boyfriend and I decided to try something different and go to Firebirds.  Our server was great! He seemed like a newbe but he was very sincere and always checking up on us, which we loved. The bread is pretty amazing but I've gone to cheaper places that have had just as good bread. 
Once our plates arrived the food was good but we didnt have very much food on our plates. I was very disappointed by the $$$ to amount of food we were getting. In addition to the food, it was VERY loud and I think a lot of it comes from the kitchen being right off of the dining room. 
All in all we will not be returning and we recommend you spend your money at Abuelos across the street. (Chandler Mall)"}
{"text":"I have dined at this place 3 different times now... every time is seriously amazing. I don't have 1 complaint there happy hour YOU CAN NOT BEAT. The service is great. I have had the prime rib which is amazing... the blue cheese bacon wrapped filet is it though!! idk if there is any topping that one. It was the best steak I have ever had. Lobster quest is to die for. The deviled eggs are amazing. I can seriously go on and on... I have lived in Arizona for 4 years and finally found my go to!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the sesame salmon and it was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant it has an incredible menu and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Seriously, eat anything and it's great.  I'm not going to tell you what to have or when to go.  Just bring an appetite, money, and friend to sample their choice.  I repeat, ORDER anything and it's good."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour for appetizers and drinks. The appetizers were excellent, as well as the service. You can have your fish or shrimp tacos with deep fried or grilled..a nice option. Check out this restaurant if you are in the area..you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I cannot really tell you anything about the menu in this restaurant because we eat in the bar during happy hour. The wings here are amazing. They are smoked which gives them a great underpinning of flavor, then seasoned with traditional spicy or BBQ sauce. You get about 10-12 bones for $5 during happy hour and then drinks are half-priced too. These wings are so good they keep us coming back week after week. Its our Wednesday night date night destination."}
{"text":"Here with my two daughters for Valentine's Day. The restaurant is about 60% full. Not very bustling for the \"most romantic night of the year\". First time here and I like the interior. It's like a nice upscale cabin. Very classy lumberjack.

My daughters ordered off the kids' menu (chicken strips and hamburger). Their meals look excellent for being kids' meals. They both got two sides (fresh veggies and fresh fruit, but could've chosen fries, green beans, Mac & cheese, or parmesean mashed potatoes). The burger looks good quality and chicken strips came with honey mustard and were delicious. Yes, I tried them. It was came with a small two cookie pack of Oreos.

I ordered a medium rare aged 14oz ribeye with a loaded baked potato. The loaded potato looked exactly like the one at Texas Roadhouse. I'm not opposed to that, but for $6 less, I could've gotten a bigger ribeye and the same potato. The ribeye was overcooked, on the latter end of the medium well side. Almost well done. Very little pink. Decent seasoning, but dry and chewy.

The service was very lacking. Our waitress was so hard to get ahold of that the burger went ketchup-less and my iced tea went sugar-free for about half of our meal. BUT, she was nice and apologetic and at least seemed genuine about it. Not sure why we were ignored though. 2.76489 stars but I'll round up to 3"}
{"text":"Great addition to Gilbert.  Great food and absolutely wonderful service. Our food was perfect.  I love that you can be on the patio in the summer, AC but open air feel. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Epic fail, ordered fillet med got rare. Friend ordered salmon, not cooked all the way. Terrible cooks, they will comp some cheap drinks but the $25 entrees were the problem! Never come back again peace"}
{"text":"I was talking with an Arizona friend of mine today (I have moved to WA state) and suddenly felt homesick...for Firebirds!

Another poster says that Firebirds is her favorite chain restaurant. I have to agree, largely because it never felt like a chain restaurant. The servers are friendly and attentive, the food is always good, and the ambience is pleasant - quiet enough to have a conversation without feeling like you are eating in a library.

For lunch, the Seared Ahi Tuna is melt-in-your-mouth good. The Firebirds BLT Salad is way too sinful to be called \"salad,\" but I will call it \"delicious.\" And the Durango Burger is to die for. It is piled too high for the average person to eat without a knife and fork, but I unhinged my jaw and took it down. Yum!

At dinnertime, I definitely enjoyed the Double Black Diamond Martini. Possibly a little too sweet, but really good just the same. You can't go wrong with the Sesame Encrusted Salmon. It was tender and juicy.

*Sigh* Now I am hungry. Time to plan an AZ visit and a stop at Firebirds!"}
{"text":"When Firebirds first opened in the Stonecrest Plaza we were regulars.  Both the service and the quality seemed to be very good.  However, as time wore on it became more and more disappointing.   We would stop going and then give it another try.  We would always come away disappointed.

I been to other Firebirds and the experience has been about the same.

Firebirds does have a hoping afterwork scene.  The bar and outdoor lounge are always crowded on Fridays and Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"Not a place I would put near the top of my list, but good enough.

Went for NYE 2015 as well as August 2014.  My dates/friends and I ordered steaks and cocktails each time without disappointment.

Outback Steakhouse is my barometer for measuring all steakhouses, and while Firebirds' steaks aren't much better than Outback's their ambience and decor is very warm, cozy and intimate.  

I'm not big on cocktails, but I can say that the martini with vodka was average."}
{"text":"We went to Firebirds with my Mom for Mother's Day this evening. We decided to go there because of the nice experiences we have had in the past. We considered Firebirds one of the better restaurants in the P83 area. Unfortunately, this was not the experience we had this evening. We don't know if Firebird's is under new management but the noise level made normal conversation very difficult. There was background pop music being played at a level that didn't help. Along with several of the waiter staff racing back and forth it made for a hectic atmosphere. My wife ordered her favorite BLT salad and gave up on it after a few bits due to it being almost tasteless. I split the cilantro chicken with my mom and the sauce was barely warm.  To top it off, our waiter acted like he didn't want to be there and his attitude permeated our overall experience. We feel sad that one of our favorite restaurants has taken a turn for the worst."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice now, and both times we weren't disappointed.  From the steak and burgers to the salmon and fries, everything tasted just as it should.  That might be a problem for some people who are looking for above average tasting food, but for someone who's just looking for a nice sit-down meal in a calm atmosphere after a long day, it's perfect.  Both times my steak was cooked just right, the fries were just crispy enough, the drinks (arnold palmer) were made with just the right amount of tea and lemonade.  J's salmon was flaky and his meatloaf was actually quite moist and delicious with the gravy.  

Again, it is quite average, there are no over-the top flavours here, but it is safe and comfortable and the staff is more than accomodating (sometimes to the point where you will have 3 people helping each other with their tables) in every aspect."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was bland boring and overpriced. Went for a business lunch and expected much more from their food. Wait staff was friendly and prompt but for $50 for 3 salads and fountain drinks I was extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"I love firebirds! Great happy hour 4-630 m-f . I only wish they had it on the weekend. Love the grilled fish tacos and sirloin sliders. Also the double black diamond martini is half off on happy hour as well as the kettle one dirty martini!"}
{"text":"The family came for Father's Day. The food is wonderful! You can smell the wood fired grill when you walk in. The waitress was polite and friendly. It's a little pricey, but so worth the splurge. The filet, shrimp, ribs, burgers and chicken pasta were all superb. We all think this was the best food we've had."}
{"text":"I haven't had firebirds in quite some time, as there isn't one where I live...so while in Phoenix, I think I will! 

Server was awesome. I wanted soup and she allowed me to sample the two they had for the day. 
She was also great with recommending I get the chili rub on my salmon! AMAZING! I never knew you could customize!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here.Everything was excellent. The customer service was awsome and the food was out of this world good."}
{"text":"My best friend took me here when i flew to visit her at Charlotte. The wait was a bit long (about an hour or so) but we took advantage of the bar and ordered a few glasses of wine. We had a great booth for just us girls and we  just kept ordering more wine...why not? we were celebrating! We all ordered the filet mignon cooked to medium rare. We kept on talking and drinking and never realized we were waiting more than an hour for our food to arrive. We only noticed when the manager came up to us to apologize for our long wait and he would grant us a free dessert. At first we were like \"really? for what\" and that's when we realized so much time had flown by. I give the severs props for being the first to admit their errors, without us asking for the manager directly. We really didnt care much though as we were having too much of a blast to even notice :)

I'll definitely be back to this place when i return to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I Called ahead on Saturday to make a reservation for some 20 family members for my wife's birthday on Sunday afternoon. Pedro the manager was enthusiastic in taking the information and said that he would make sure things were ready for the group. He even suggested that he may come in a bit earlier to assist and help us decorate if I chose. We arrived and everything was ready to go. The servers were Lauren and Yvette. The food and service was fantastic. My son stated the service was \"Seamless\" As \"perfect as service can be for a group our size\" We dine here or take out several times each month and always have enjoyed. But this experience was above and beyond. The Firebird's staff allowed my wife and our family to absolutely enjoy our get together. I would without doubt highly recommend this restaurant for dining at a reasonable menu cost! Thanks Pedro, Lauren and Yvette and those behind the scenes. You made this a perfect birthday event."}
{"text":"The great reviews brought me here while in town for work. I fluctuated between 4 and 5 stars. The food was good and the meat was cooked well, so 4 stars. The service was outstanding and would give 6 stars. Hence, the 5 stars.
I was seated quickly and the witness was prompt. She continually checked back and my drink was never empty. The table was cleared quickly after each dish. Food was prompt and never had to wait around. 
I had the rib eye, which was cooked well and great flavor. The grilled shrimp with chile was delicious. Salad and bread were good too. 
An overall nice dining experience. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food is great but I agree that the place can be loud, too loud, at dinner time. Great service though and great food, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday with a few of my co workers and while the place was nice, staff was friendly, I just feel they are trying way too hard. I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup and the sesame incrusted salmon. My soup came in time however no spoon. Was looking for a my server and she was busy, in fact the restaurant was packed, I even spotted her helping people at the table next to us and turned and so did my co worker and she saw us but still didn't acknowledge the fact that we may need something and when done with them she walked away. Finally I see another server and ask for a spoon. Soup tasted delicious but too bad it was cold. 

The salmon was great, I loved every bit of it but the fried spinach was very salty. I also substituted the mashed potato with steamed veggies and that was a very sorry looking dish. It literally came with 2-3 flowerettes of  broccoli and a couple thinly sliced zucchini sand 3 half circle red onions. I noticed that my coworkers dishes were somewhat similar (sides are very little), my co worker ordered a burger and he got fries with it and man they are stingy with the sides. Lunch Salads on the other hand looked great. This is the second time we do a co worker lunch here and we do those once every couple of months and next time I will opt out if they choose firebird. Not worth the money for me and taste is not WOW."}
{"text":"We had the coupon special $14.00 Rib-eye the overall service was very good! very impressed by wait staff, but our steaks were not good at all, kinda tough, and not tasty at all, just taste like grilled cardboard, not flavor of beef, hummm! not sure why, I've been to other firebirds and never had this to happen. We paid over $50 for our meal celebrating our 32nd year anniversary, and I felt cheated. I took my steak home to see if I can revive it to taste better, too much money wasted on it."}
{"text":"I started coming to Firebirds around 1999 - 2000, you know, back when I had hair.  Firebirds was the best place IMO to eat in Ballantyne back then.  Well, here we are 13 years later and I am about 40 lbs heavier, and my hair has fallen by the wayside and Firebirds still is a righteous choice for dinner.
I still remember the 1.5 - 2 hour wait so it was about 5:15 Friday night and we waltzed in and were seated promptly, I like that.  We were greeted by Debbie our server who was very attentive and took great care of us.  Appetizer of the Lobster Spinach Queso AKA \"App of the Gods\" which was chock full of lobster and cheesy goodness, it's a bit steep at $11.95 or so but well worth it.
As a purist, I ordered the NY Strip, loaded baked potato and Firebirds BLT Salad.  Being a customer 10 years ago, I remember certain things...the BLT Salad is one of them.  It's not the same as it used to be.  It was still good, but it was MUCH smaller than years ago and the $4.95 add on charge is way to high for less than $1.00 worth of salad.
The NY Strip was also tasty and the inside was cooked perfectly.  The grill was a tad bit hot and the outside of the steak was a bit charred for my taste but overall it was a solid steak that I enjoyed.  I enjoyed the potato also and it rounded out the meal well.
One of the highlights of this place, which hasn't changed is the freakin' awesome bread that is served with the meal.  it is an individual loaf of hot, doughy perfection and to cut out a middle slice and smear the salted butter that accompanies it is something I imagine I will be doing in heaven, if I ever make it there.
In summation, I must say I enjoyed my experience last night.  I realize some places change and restaurants must adjust to stay competitive, but Firebirds still offers a great meal"}
{"text":"I am very upset, because they took the chicken quesadillas off the menu AND the coconut shrimp.   Their quesadillas were the BEST!
The coconut shrimp were also delicious.  These are two of my three favorite items (chicken tortilla soup) on their menu that I have been enjoying for many, many years.  PLEASE BRING THE QUESADILLAS BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Unreal. We have been here so many times before and loved it. Tonight we came for my husband's birthday. We waited nearly an hour, approximately 10 mins or so more than we were told. We can understand that happens. Then we ordered 2 steaks medium rare. My husband's steak was rare... and when they brought it back out they brought 1/2 of it (note we hadn't eaten any of it). The poor waiter tried to make things right but management should have come to the table. We had to ask for the manager, he wanted us to pay for our drinks! Are you kidding me? We were there for almost 2 hours with zero food for my husband! I had to eat while watched him getting angrier and angrier! Terrible experience."}
{"text":"The salmon on the Strawberry salad is never completly cooked even if you ask them to make sure it is. Must be new cooks but mgmt needs to take notice since this can be a very dangerous meal to consume uncooked seafood that is not sushi grade. Ive told the manager on duty @ least 3 times so now its my fault for continuing to order."}
{"text":"Just came home from a fantastic dinner. The BLT salad is a must. Our server was Maggie who was attentive but not hovering. A great conversationist.  Mgr Pedro was her equal in all aspects. I hope he goes far with the corporation."}
{"text":"You shouldn't have both bad take out service and horrible food because one or the other needs to lure you back.  This is 3x too many which is sad because it's so close/convenient.  On hold 7 min, girl couldn't hear to take the order and it wasn't ready when we arrived at the appointed time so not sure how it was cold as ice in the 3 minutes it took us to get home.  The wood fired salmon was disgusting and not cooked as requested.  The spinach was beyond gross with something slimy poured over the top.  We will be driving a little further for decent service and food so goodbye Firebirds!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service.  I've eaten here twice this week while in town on business.  The main entree both times was just kinda \"meh\".  The first night, I had some sort of pasta dish; I can't remember what it was called right now, but it basically tasted like a poorly executed Thai panang curry, except instead of using noodles, it had ziti and it had bacon in it.  The second time I ate here, I tried the ribeye steak because my dining companions raved about how great the steak was.  The ribeye was definitely flavorful, but it wasn't at all tender.  It was pretty tough.  Kinda disappointing, actually.  

The highlight of my meal at Firebird's was the creme brulé cheese cake.  That's gotta be the best cheesecake I've had in a while.  So, if you like cheesecake, give this place a try."}
{"text":"We had mothers day dinner here. Got a table pretty quick and had an awesome server. We all enjoyed our food so many options it was hard to choose for everyone. Not one person had anything bad to say about our whole experience here. We will be back. There was a sauce with my crab cakes a mango jalapeno sauce that I was blown away by. I don't ever eat any kind of meat and was happy to see that they had crab for my once a year real proteins intake. All in all we were really happy coming here. Prices were normal for a stake house but it was worth it! The food is worth coming back and the atmosphere was very nice. Cool wood accents all beautiful."}
{"text":"This classy, mid-priced steak and seafood place in the Stonecrest shopping center serves up terrific dishes with friendly service in a relaxed and comfortable setting that's perfect for lunch, dinner or a round of drinks. Stopping in before a movie recently, my wife and I started off with the fantastic Lobster Spinach Queso appetizer, which was large and tasty enough to be a meal in itself. 

For my entree, I ordered the Parmesan Encrusted Mahi, which was good, though a bit lacking in flavor. My wife enjoyed a delicious Colorado Chicken Salad and a glass of wine from the restaurant's impressive selection. There's also a decent menu of local craft beers, although the options were a bit disappointing, considering the wide selection of breweries in and around Charlotte.

Firebirds is a decent spot for dinner and drinks in South Charlotte, although the beer menu could use some work. Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Each time we have gone to Firebirds, the food and service have been great.  Good craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food in a beautiful setting.  Only negative voiced by one of our diners was that the service \"felt a bit intrusive\" as they several times attempted  to clear our plates from the table before we were ready for that.  Restaurant wasn't trying to get us out faster, I think it was just that we had a server in training and he was trying to do a good job.   We loved this place and will return next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to come here to celebrate my 30th birthday. The food was amazing. I got the beef tenderloin with shrimp. It was so tender and cooked perfectly. I also ordered the double diamond pineapple martini and it was delicious! We finished the night with creme brûlée cheesecake which was the bomb. The service was fantastic, especially our server Jamie. She was on top of everything and made the night special for us. Thank you! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"So this is the 2nd time I have been to a firebirds. This one is way better than the last time. I was at a location in NJ that sucked. 

Service has been really good. She has a great attitude for a server. Her name was Krista M you should ask for her she was so nice and very efficient. 

I had the double diamond martini which is their 21 day pineapple infused vodka. It was pretty tasty if you like pineapple. String hit of vodka. 


I was seated close to the kitchen while it is nice to watch it is a little warm. 

I had the Delmonico and it was fantastic. With a side of au grautain potatoes. The cheese sauce was salty and good and so not healthy but yum. 

I wouls go back. Considering it is on restaurant row I was not sure if it would be good."}
{"text":"Last night I met a friend for dinner.  She had a coupon for buy two appetizers get a free lobster/cheese appetizer.  I arrived first.  Stuck my hand in something sticky, and the appetizer plate was dirty.  She arrives and immediately announces the coupon and orders.  15 mins (or more) passes and the manager walks over to tell us we must order from the wood fire grill to use the coupon - would we like to change our order.  She ordered two entrees and I ordered a salad $15.95.  No thanks!  (Mind you why did it take so long to put the ap order in to begin with).  Another 10-15 mins goes by and he comes back over to try and sell again the \"up order\" tells us there is nothing he can do.  I said, look I'm really hungry are you telling me you have still NOT put in our original entree order?  He says well, no!  We had by now been here 45 mins.  No aps and no order in!  He tries to explain this promo is being audited and he cannot do anything about it.  OK great.  Why are we still chatting and not getting food?  I got up and promptly left to go to Famous Daves.  Food-1/2 price and the place was PACKED and we still waited no time for really great food.
Mind you-I have been to Firebirds many times and have never been impressed with service but, this took the cake.  The food has always been good though.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"Nice setting, a little loud. My friend ordered the calamari and it was good - fresh, not overly fried. I ordered a mixed green side salad, grilled salmon, and mashed potatoes. It wasnt anything to write home about, but it wasn't bad. Our server was friendly and attentive. I would return to try a different menu item."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Just don't order the lobster. Super tough and chewy and I won t ever order it again here"}
{"text":"I don't like to leave reviews like this but I think that I should share my experience from last night. 
We came in for happy hour, around 6PM. Lucky us, there was a table that just left so we grabbed it. Everything started perfectly, great service, great happy hour prices. 
We ordered 3 cocktails, one of them was a berry Moscow Mule, it was excellent! So we ordered another one and weirdly it didn't taste the same, so we asked our waitress if it was the same bartender that made it, she came back and told us that actually they ran out of Ginger Beer so they put Ginger Ale instead. Seriously? That's horrible customer service and we felt like they were robbing us, it's like ordering a gin tonic and they only give you the tonic. We were very mad after this.
The waitress apologized and of course we didn't drink it. 
The waitress asked us if we wanted to take a look at the wine list instead, we did, and we ordered the Meomi Pinot Noir, she asked if we wanted a glass or the bottle, we said just a glass. Came the bill, the glass of wine was $16?! On the menu, there were 3 prices, $12, $16 (1/2 bottle) and $36 or $32 (bottle, doesn't remember). 
They took off $4 at the end because we told them it wasn't normal, poor customer service again.
Oh and I won't even mention the $1 surcharge to get my shrimp spicy (wth...) 
Anyway, not a great experience overall, I don't think we will be back. It's sad, because the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much to corporate for reaching out to me. I was able to go back to firebirds and have a great experience. I've actually been back a couple times since my last review. The thing I really like is that they not only listened to my concerns but said they would work to imporve them! Firebirds makes me feel like they truly do care about customer retention. Definitely will be a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"Bravo new Firebirds in Gilbert! You did it right! Great, comfortable atmosphere, excellent food and drinks. You had us at \"Now Open\"."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but we had an inexperienced server that couldn't understand our food allergy requests.  Nobody died, but food was mediocre and expensive.  Pass on this one."}
{"text":"We just had dinner for the first time here...and it was AMAZING. I love the atmosphere, very relaxing. Our server was amazing! Very attentive. All the entrees came quick and hot. And the lemonade was DELICIOUS!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"FireBirds is a great restaurant for families and romantic dates. The Delmonico Ribeye is wondeful. It's tender and seasoned perfectly. It's definitely elevated American style food add it's one of our go-to places for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and service was excellent. Good date night place. We had the prime rib, baked potato, chicken tortilla soyo, and augratin potatoes. Absolutely delicious. We will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great prime rib and half price wine on Monday's. This place rocks great food also. The prime rib is very tender and the baked potato is solid. Service is great"}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars because our Server was outstanding! I didn't get her name, however she was working Sat. night 10/25 - young blonde woman.
Anyway, the salads were fresh & crisp, our steak & prime rib were cooked to order & seasoned well - delicious. Food & drinks were delivered in a timely manner. We made some substitutes to sides that came with the meal and their response was \"my pleasure\". We were able to talk with our friends without shouting to be heard & the manager came to check our table. For a chain restaurant they haven't forgotten the personal touch and we will continue to frequent Firebirds as well as recommend it!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here one night and probably tried every cocktail they offer in one sitting.... Here is my sober review:

Favorites: cucumber martini, dirty w/ belvedere (blue cheese olives), the last coffee cocktail on the menu, one of the guys even ensured our cocktails were constantly in an ice cold glass -- that's what I'm talking about 

Service & management is great

Seasonal tuna salad w/ quinoa was perfect"}
{"text":"I visited Firebirds with my wife during the recent Arizona Restaurant Week. I didn't realize it was a chain until after I'd made reservations. This would usually be a nonstarter for locavores like us, but the prix-fixe menu looked appealing and it was close to home for a weeknight dinner, so we stuck with the plan.

The place is BIG. Claim Jumper big, but not obscene like Cheesecake Factory. This was a bit of a put-off, but the dim lighting and well-spaced seating made it feel a bit more intimate. The smell of wood smoke in the entryway was delightful and did a good job communicating what Firebirds is all about. Both the hostess and waiter were polite and knowledgeable. Service was attentive but not rushed on what appeared to be a slow weeknight; we spent an hour or so enjoying our dinner rather than feeling like a \"turn.\"

The Restaurant Week menu was a great bargain at 30 bucks a head for an app, entree and dessert. Learning that wine by the bottle was half price that night was just a cherry on top. They started us out with a nice bit of crusty fresh baked bread.

For apps, the boss had a crab cake and I ordered Firebirds' signature BLT salad. The crab cake was well seasoned, if a bit mushy in the center. The accompanying coleslaw was a split decision--I liked it, but she didn't enjoy the tortilla strips that were meant to add crunch. Honestly, the crisp purple cabbage provided plenty of texture. I'm not usually a salad guy, but the BLT was fantastic. The finely-diced tomatoes and abundant large bits of crisp thick-cut bacon appeared in every bite and it was tossed with just the right amount of creamy garlic dressing.

Our entrees were nicely prepared, which is a tall order when one of them is a pork tenderloin--a cut that's not naturally flavorful and very easy to dry out. Mine was done to a perfect medium (as promised by our waiter) with a moist, barely pink center despite a great char from the grill. Another half teaspoon of the glaze and it would've been perfect. The wife's sea bass was cooked and seasoned well, but the thickness of the fillet was inconsistent, resulting in slightly overcooked edges. The potato sides (chile cheddar mash for me and a potato pancake for her) were both excellent but overabundant. We sure would've loved some fresh veg instead of all those carbs (and plenty of butter, no doubt).

Our desserts were nothing to write home about. The flute of mixed fresh berries and cream was light and refreshing, but nothing more than you'd expect. The chocolate brownie a la mode was a bit dense and lacked the chocolate punch and fudgy texture I look for in a good brownie; it certainly didn't give the impression that it was baked in house.

With the exception of the potato sides mentioned above, portion sizes were appropriate--satisfying but not excessive. The prices listed on the regular menu for the items we ordered were pushing the limits of what I'd consider fair; they certainly wouldn't be what I'd consider a bargain.

Overall, we were impressed. This three-star review is in part a reflection of my personal preference for small, locally-owned restaurants with executive chefs you know by name. Compared head-to-head against its true peers (upper-echelon national chains), it's deserving of four stars and will be one of our go-to places when we need a safe choice for a nice dinner with a mixed group of friends or family."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, mine was really really salty.  Kind of an interesting place though, looks like a Colorado lodge but what's that decor doing in Arizona??  Looks like a good place to go after work for happy hour and hangin with friends, so-so for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Had wonderful food n drink at Happy Hour! Double Black Diamond martini delicious. Shrimp app cooked perfectly n BLT salad fantastic!"}
{"text":"Firebirds is pretty awesome. The food is good, the service is good and the ambiance is nice. There are moose heads on the walls and ridiculously high ceilings, so it's got that \"Classy Elks Club Hunting Lodge\" type feel to it...It's really open, yet cozy.  I like the wood grilled options on the menu (go figure), and their grilled chicken is especially delicious.

The ranch rings are um...stupid good. They are my favorite onion rings ever, and they're accompanied by the best ranch ever. So, it's pretty safe to assume that I recommend you try them if you like rings (and who doesn't like rings???). I also really like their salads, which you'll need to start eating more of if you order the ranch rings. Their ribs are also very good, and they make a pretty good burger as well.

The only downside here is that it's retiree central in this place. I don't know what it is about Firebirds, but old people flock to this place like it's Pensacola, Florida in November. If you dine here, get ready to wait for a little while and plan to stub your toe on a walker or two...

In all seriousness, respect the your elders...Also, Firebirds is a great place to get lunch or dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have always had great meals with good ambiance, not the case tonight. Service was slow and our waitress was indifferent at best. Food was overly salty, there was no difference between the medium and medium rare prime rib in cooking...Guess we will start looking elsewhere for our special dinners out."}
{"text":"Firebirds does it right. Au gratin potatoes are insane, they should charge $25 for those. Steaks are always perfectly done as ordered. Bread service, etc, but what sets them aside from others is their service. From host stand to dropping the check and the goodbye, they're all there because they want to be. We went there with 8 people a couple weeks ago on a busy Saturday night, it was flawless."}
{"text":"I'm just wrapping a great to-go order. 
Got the peppercorn + au gratin + crab cake + mushrooms & blue cheese topped. I was wondering how they'd handle this all and I must say I am quite impressed enough to stop and write an actual review. 

Yes, I've been more than 2x and usually Happy Hour - which is daily, in the bar and patio only. 

Y'all they packaged this Medium Well peppercorn 12oz cut in slices (which next time I'll request not to do) with the blue cheese and mushrooms separated in a ramekin. Crab cakes are like someone from home made them (insert googly eyes) as the crab is THICK and CHUNKY non of that cheap shredded stuff. Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Those boys DID THEIR THING. I debated on trying chicken as I've never had it here and I've had the salmon before and thought about it again but opted for the steak. 

No pictures, y'all. I thought about it but kept going as my greediness kicked in. Boom~ 

I must say, I'd rather have 2 sides because I can't resist the au gratin yet I'd love to try something else. I didn't see an option to add a side but they do allow you to add on soup or salad, lobster tail, crab cake, grilled shrimps..the usual add-on. 

Either way, I like AJ's management style here so yeah I mean to try other places but never get around to making myself go. 

I can't vouch for the pineapple infused martini as I didn't really taste any pina."}
{"text":"It's been open here so long, I forgot about it, but AZ Restaurant Week brought me back. Who knew they had Saturday Happy Hour until 5pm?! My $5 martini with house infused pineapple vodka was delicious. Many specials throughout the week. The best mashed potatoes I every had, garlicky, cheesy yum! Steak was cooked perfectly. Such nice decor and staff."}
{"text":"Great new place. Will definitely be back. Fall off the bone ribs. Great salmon. Super salads and good staff."}
{"text":"Firebirds.   I LOVE their lunches - Steak Salad (Filet Mignon sliced on a bed of greens) with an added round of grilled shrimp - delicious.  The Pecan Encrusted Trout is great as well.  Simply put, they have a lot of good stuff....at lunch.   Dinner however, well... 

.. Dinner - what is up with the chewy prime rib?  I wouldn't complain but this has happened more than once!  

This is sad because your lunches always hit-it-out-of-the-park...but your dinners always balk and foul.  

Now,I know what you're thinking; but, I DON'T send food back...too many reasons to list and I'm sure you'll understand..especially if you've worked in the restaurant industry.

Firebirds is a good name and concept.  Let's work to fix the evening meals.  Buy good meat in bulk for prep and resale.  Hit the local Costco if you have to...the margin will probably be in the 90% range!

Either way -  The wait staff is good,  drinks are good (a moderate pour), and the restrooms are generally clean.  

Due to the (emperical) fact that the place is wall to wall patrons every weekend evening, I highly doubt they'll address the sub-par meat issue.  We'll see...but at least put it in a crock pot....that tough meat will make good soup the day after!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Saturday night with my family and dad.  We had a reservation and were seated right away.  We were celebrating my father's birthday.  We have been to Firebirds around six-eight times with most of them at this location. Our server, Lauren, was excellent. One of the managers also came by to check on us.  I had the prime rib which was very good.  Wife had the Aspen Steak and father had the filet mignon.  My son had the prime rib sandwich and daughter had the kids sirloin.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The prime rib was a good sized piece and was cooked just the way i wanted it. The baked potato was very good too. I have never had a bad meal at Firebirds.  The only miss of the night was that I was surprised they didn't bring a comp dessert for my dad it was his birthday. I can't remember going to a similar priced restaurant and not receiving a little something for the birthday guest. But overall we had a great meal and service and will return."}
{"text":"Loved our late lunch the day of the Kentucky Derby. As on prior visits, the food and service were excellent but this time the Mint Juleps really made our day. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"I made reservations to take my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. Upon arriving, we waited around 10 minutes then were seated. We started off with the lobster queso appetizer after seeing countless reviews saying it was a must and it was incredible! We both got ribeyes and the overall quality of the meat was good and cooked exactly the way we asked. I got the Parmesan potatoes and those were great as well, will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have dined at FB's several times in various states over the years. After my last lunch there, I have to say that the quality and service at this particular location have gone  way down. I went here for lunch the week before Christmas with two other people. Initially two of us ordered soup and salad combo and added a crab cake to the salad, for an additional cost.  The other party got the chicken tortilla soup and I tried the soup of the day which was Black bean. 

When my soup arrived there were very few black beans in it, mostly onion, celery and tomatoes. I had to exchange it for the chicken tortilla which was tasty but could have had more chicken in it. The salads were okay but the crab cakes were very small and very bready, not much crab taste. 

The third person in our party ordered the the portabello mushroom sandwich. She expected he mushroom and tomato and onion garnishments to be grilled and warm. They were not.  The sandwich was cold. Also there was supposed to be feta on the sandwich and she tasted none. She sent it back and got a soup and salad combo.

We attempted to follow up with or waiter but he was not very attentive. Finally we contacted the manager. He was apologetic and took off the sandwich and did not charge her for the combo which we appreciated. He tried to make it right, and I give him credit for that.

We had dined here earlier in the year and had a disappointing meal. It feels like FB is cutting corners but not the prices. The food is not cheap but it is not of good quality. And there is really no excuse for poor service. You have to train your people to come back, check on diners, ask if everything is okay, refill glasses etc.  Our server was absolutely clueless. If serving is not your thing, you need another line of work. We typically tip 18-20% but this server was lucky to get the basic 15%. I don't see us returning there any time soon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, service and spirits selections was very good. Appetizer bread that comes out first is very good and might have been my favorite thing. Caesar salad was good, enjoyed the chili crusted croutons. Ordered. 7oz filet and Parmesan mashed Yukon gold mashed potatoes. Potatoes and steak were very average. Could not taste and Parmesan in the potatoes and really just tasted like MP with butter. The steak was so charred on the outside it overpowered any flavor the steak had. Also salad came out same time steak did. Typically there should be some time between the two so you can eat your
M salad first. Overall I think I would go back but would not get the steak or mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and our host suggested this place for lunch. What a mistake. Really slow service. I ordered a side Caesar salad to start and a French dip sandwich for my entree. My salad was brought out after my sandwich so I didn't want to bother with it and let my food get cold. I asked the waitress to box it to go. She said she would box a new salad and put the dressing on the side so it wouldn't wilt the lettuce. The sandwich was terrible. There was seemingly no seasoning at all on the meat. It was really chewy and unpleasant in texture. The au jus was totally flavorless. Massive fail. After leaving I noticed that there was no dressing packed for my salad. Talk about a disappointing lunch outing. We wasted almost 2 hours at this place and it was not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"This was nice. All very flavorful. Just as expected. Had a really good time. Only thing I would do is ask for my dressing on the side. There food has a load of calories but with the splurge. Request the bread. I liked the crab cake. Hubby ordered surf and turf and that was really good. Our son ordered salmon and it was really good too."}
{"text":"was pleasantly surprised but this place... i thought it was just going to be standard fare you would get at a BJ's or Applebees. 

Fully stocked bar with several beers on tap... they also had a bottle of king louie johnnie walker.... Very impressive to have on a bar shelf even know 99% of the people cant afford the $190 a shot price....

Menu was a little pricy too but had some good choices on it...  I ordered the ribeye with a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes cooked medium.. The steak came out perfectly cooked and seasoned... 

I sat at the bar and had my dinner there and the bartender was very courteous and attentive..."}
{"text":"Dined out last night and really enjoyed the food. Service was great although a little slow, but it was a busy Friday night.  I believe our server was Sasha. She was attentive and professional. I'd definitely go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Overal loved the ambiance, service, and food. I had the Wood grilled salmon and its was delicious along with the tasty veggies that came with it. I chose the mashed potatoes as a side and this was where I was disappointed. Their mashed potatoes definitely tasted like instant mashed potatoes! Super tacky. I'm a potato lover, especially French fries and mashed potatoes, so I can tell if they're real or fake. These mashed potatoes had the consistency and texture of boxed instant mashed potatoes- I was a bit disappointed, but I still ate them haha. Everything else was delicious. The Salmon? O.M.G. Perfect! Super tender and juicy! I definitely would order this entree again, just choose French fries or tater tots instead of the mashed. Oh, and the Lobster spinach queso dip appetizer? That was incredibly delicious as well."}
{"text":"I had their salmon and veggies with mouth watering potatoes...A fabulous restaurant with very tasty food. A place to go if you have money to spend. Great atmosphere and service. Delish!"}
{"text":"My wife, friend and I met for happy hour. It was the first time we were there and definitely give it two thumbs up. We had a couple of drinks each.  My wife had the fried up shrimp, I had buffalo style chicken tenderloins and our friend had the beef sliders. All appetizers were prepared perfect and tasted great. The margaritas also very tastey. Added to a cery good time was the excellent customer service we received.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The 4 star is for the food... But I'd give the wait 2 thumbs down! But once you are seated, some warm sourdough is offered to you which will make you forget about the hour long wait for dinner on a Friday night! Next time I'll come here when it's not so busy. Or call ahead to make reservations:p"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and our experience was excellent.  We both had the fillet with Shrimp.  The steak was prepared perfectly, and the bacon wrap combined with the seasoning made for a very palatable flavor.  The loaded baked potato was warm and tender all the way through.  The shrimp added an excellent accomplishment to the rest of the meal. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last week with family for my cousin's birthday.  The decor is surprisingly nice. We were seated at one of those curved booths for parties of 4 or more. The server came right over & took our drink order. We ordered the lobster fondue as an app, DELICIOUS!  The chef also came out & greeted us (which I thought was really cool). I ordered the filet mignon wrapped in bacon with shrimp & chile mac n cheese as the side, everything was wonderful!  The server provided excellent service and we never had an empty glass. I will most definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I love Firebirds.  Went to this location when I was recently up in Phoenix for work.  We have one in Tucson that is just as good -- chain but a good chain.  Great, solid service and friendly staff.  This location was just as good as my local location.  Had the cheeseburger -- was craving one and it was fresh and cooked to order.  Skinny fries on the side (yum) and you can add a small salad on the side for a few bucks more."}
{"text":"Firebirds is known for their warm hospitality, and inviting atmosphere. The food and service are top notch! I've dined at three locations in North Carolina (Raleigh, Ballantyne, South Park Charlotte).  I LOVE the South Park location, they offer a private room for small events. Check with management for details. 

The dim lighting, design, and decor make for an enjoyable atmosphere to be in. Menu prices reasonable, I would highly recommend trying their happy hour menu. Also, don't miss trying their signature martini, The Double Black Diamond! So Delish!!

Here's a list of all my favorite meals:
- Lobster Spinach Queso
- Smoked Chicken Wings
- Crab Cakes
- Fired Up Shrimp
- Grilled Shrimp & Strawbery Salad
- Pepper Encrusted Sirloin* AMAZING!!!
- Parmesan Encrusted Mahi
- Firebirds Chicken Pasta

Overall this is by far my favorite American restaurant. This establishment has met/exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I've been to Firebirds a few times in various locations.  My Fiance and I attempted to dine at this location. We waited for almost 1hr for a table---No, it was not busy. When my boss took everyone out for lunch, I was hesitant. 

Overall the food was good. The Cocktails are great! I love their signature pineapple cocktail......My recent visit, I ordered a Caesar Salad w/ shrimp, choked on a few shells.....should've looked before eating. Our servers took forever with our check. I could see my boss getting frustrated. 

Will I come back, probably....Like I like the food. It's good."}
{"text":"They must be making a killing.  This is in a stand-alone building near the mall, in an upscale area and the interior decor is very upscale, they call it \"polished casual.\"  The menu is oriented towards steak and seafood prepared with a live fuel or wood-fired grill.  I really did like the setting.  It also has a little bit of the outdoors or Pacific Northwest feel to the decor with the stone and wood as well as the giant Elk head above the entrance.
The menu has a wide variety of options with a lot of bold flavors like \"chile rubbed\" and \"au Poivre,\" \"key lime butter,\" etc.  My lunch entree was no different, a basic turkey club served on \"jalapeno bread\" with roasted red pepper mayo and applewood smoked bacon.  I also started with a cup of the everyday tortilla soup with sour cream and scallion.  The soup was excellent, I really liked the flavors and the tortilla's remained crisp.  Portion size was good for a \"cup\" of soup, really it was more like 12 ounces and nice and hot through and through so it contrasted well with the cool sour cream.  I did not think it was particularly spicy, but it was \"bold.\" 
The only disappointment was the sandwich, and that was with the jalapeno bread.  I expected a little more boldness out of the bread and possibly that it had jalapeno pieces in the bread itself, but it may have been dusted with jalapeno spice or such as you find on the jalapeno flavored potato chips at the grocery.  I really did not pick up the jalapeno flavor in any noticeable way.  The portion size of the sandwich was generous and cut into quarters, unfortunately, the ingredients were not distributed within each quarter in a consistent manner so it was like eating a slightly different sandwich from quarter to quarter, mainly with the amount of turkey, tomato and bacon in each (if any).  So I re-assembled and it was fine.  The tater tots were great, crispy and plentiful.  It likely is the case that upon serving the chef grabs a handful of tots out of the bin and dumps them on the plate in a scattered about way.  My guests had the smokehouse burger and the American Kobe Beef Meatloaf - both cleaned their plates, and reported it was very good.
Servers all wear black shirts and jeans presenting a polished look for the wait staff and everyone was friendly.  Bill was about $20 per person.
I'll have to visit my hometown location, just never have gotten to it due to traffic avoidance at its location."}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice ambiance. Great service. Excellent food. Extensive full service bar. Wonderful place to enjoy a date night out. Leave the kids with grandma, they probably wouldn't appreciate the experience anyway."}
{"text":"The interior is greatly decorated and the wood fire smell is inticing. The waitress we had was informative and polite but not as friendly as I would like. The wings were amazing, but my chicken pasta wwas over powered with bacon and although tasted good it was not something I would order again.  this place is just too expensive for the food quality we recieved"}
{"text":"I had heard some good things about this place so I figured I would pop in and give it a try. Right out the gate walking in I like the atmosphere, kind of a log cabin type set up. Our server was really friendly and helpful. I was a tad disappointed in the beer and mixed drinks selection. I had a filet mignon wrapped in bacon with some shrimp and green beans. All of the food came out promptly and cooked as requested. Not the best steak I've had but it was pretty good. I'd probably eat here again."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out with my sis n law n bro because they love it,  I however thought it was OK the meat was a bit too chewy for me but the flavors were delish. I was a little disappointed in the fact that I had to pay extra for my veggies not cool. Everyone has their own opinions so I say give it a try."}
{"text":"Have never been in before so we decided to try it. Boy were we pleasantly surprised! The bartender was friendly and helpful. She allowed me to try the black bean soup and it was amazing!! It had a little heat and tons of flavor! My husband had the Colorado chicken salad which was yummy. I had the soup and spinach salad with shrimp. Boy my salad was out of this world!! My shrimp was perfectly cooked and my spinach was chopped into bite sized pieces and crisp! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Firebirds is our go to restaurant for two reasons:1 the food is consistently fabulous 2:the service is on point 
My favorite is the Entree Spinach Salad with Ahi Tuna Yum!!!"}
{"text":"No stars!

My wife and I were looking for something different in Glendale \ Peoria area.  Lots of the usual chains here, and since we had never been in Firebirds, we might as well try it.  Mistake

It wasn't that busy and we were told by the door holder (can't call her a hostess since she was no host) said to sit anywhere.  We waited 15 minutes just to get the waitress to come take drink orders.  Not a good start.

Our Queso with Chips was cold when it came out.  Our meals were bland, greasy bar food.  My ribs tasted like they were bought from Safeway.  And service continued to be ridiculously poor.

Yelp makes me give it a star, which it doesn't deserve.  Spending $60 for dinner for 2 and having it be this bad an experience deserves no stars  

Do not waste your time at this poor excuse for a sports bar.  There are many better choices."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Beautiful and awesomely delicious food! Aged Ribeye steak and Caesar Salad. The staff is very professional, polite, and attentive. This is a must stop when you're looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday, had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. They have a Alex's Lemonade stand inside the restaurant which is cute so I donated $3 and had some lemonade while I waited.

I ordered the Pecan Encrusted Trout it was amazing and full of flavor. They don't do anything for birthdays so I ordered dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake it was decadent but sooo good! My server brought it out with a candle on it and gave me a birthday card signed by the whole team it was a very nice touch, I will return :)"}
{"text":"Wife and I tried them after reading all the good reviews. To start off, the service was not what we expected but we over looked that at the time. We ordered the Lobster Queso to start. Not bad actually. Then the salads, again not bad. Then for our Entrees, my wife ordered the Filet medium, and I the Prime Rib medium well. When the entrees arrived, her filet looked more like a charred hockey puck rather than a steak. When she cut into it, there was absolutely no juice what so ever. Dry as a bone. Needless to say she sent it back and did not want them to try again. My Prime Rib was gristly and had an odd texture like it has been sitting for a while. Not very appetizing. I took a few more bites and asked for a doggy-bag and took it home to my dog. On our way out I took a look around at the other tables. It appeared most people were having burgers. Perhaps that is what we should have ordered.... We will be going elsewhere next time we get a craving for steak. And I might add, we have had MUCH better at many other establishments in the valley. I'm sure you know the ones."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Nicole on her review.  Firebird's is a locally based chain but they haven't done anything to really set themselves apart in food from any other chain in the area.  

The atmosphere is great but with both appetizers and entrees, I felt like I could get the same quality of food for cheaper at a Ruby Tuesday.  

The service was great and very attentive.  Our server was always asking if we needed anything. But service alone isn't enough for me to want to come back here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with close friends for dinner and drinks. I'm a fan. At both visits, the waitstaff has been tremendous. On my first visit, we tried basically every appetizer on the menu. The wings, sliders, nachos and coconut shrimp were all pretty good. The fried chicken salad was enormous and very tasty. The chicken was great and the mixed greens were fresh. The bar is nicely stocked with a wide variety of liquor at various price points, and it looks cool too. Price for food is reasonable and they email you with discounts from time to time. They even have live music on the patio sometimes. It's pretty cool. If I could change something, I would have liked more variety as far as beers go, but overall I like it and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Almost perfect, 4.5. Accommodating hostess that allowed us to pick our seat. Server was personable and competent, offering to find out just the best tequila for the margaritas. Food was excellent quality, mine the colorado chicken salad.
A jarring moment was when a big arm reached across our table, after most of the dirty dishes had been removed and we were about to leave. He grabbed the random dishes, couldn't he wait a moment until we left. This guy came out of nowhere, no excuse me or nothing. He needs to show courtesy to the customers. The kitchen wasn't clamoring for our few dishes were they?"}
{"text":"This place originated in Colorado, & it really shows on the inside with its lodge type atmosphere. The lodge setting gives this place a feel unlike any other Charlotte restaurant I've been to as it's an open area with wood decor throughout. It's a stand along restaurant in a shopping center & a really nice treat if you don't mind spending the money.

I went here for lunch with work one day & I would definitely recommend this as a dinner/date night place if I were the one paying. But the food is worth the price you pay. Their menu selection is full of red meat, but also has enough other options for everyone. Portion sizes are huge, so bring your appetite along with your wallet.

The portions are huge, the food is great, the atmosphere is intriguing, & the check is big. I recommend Firebirds as a date night place where you don't mind getting your fingers & face a little dirty from their huge portions."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, from a small table to a large group and every time it has been amazing.  The atmosphere is \"lodge\" like and very warm feeling.  The staff is very friendly and the food fits perfectly with the feel.  It does get loud in there at times and the TVs are a drawback in my book and actually hinder conversation. This is a must go place, so go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Dinner Sep 15,
  What was Best in Class
    - Our server Dara, she was outstanding! friendly, funny, cheery, great disposition - she made everyone at the table smile and her recommendations were spot on!
    - Overall the entire staff was very friendly and happy!
  What was Above Average
    - The house side salad was very tasty and the pecans were awesome
    - The Ranch Dressing with the Onion Rings & salad was very very good
    - The Southwestern Au Gratin Potatoes were awesome!
  What was Okay/Average
    - Spinach Crab Dip was so-so.  The tri-color chips looked nice, but the taste was bland.
    - Liked the fresh baked bread, but the butter was hard as a rock and was impossible to spread
     - The Steaks were average, cooked as ordered, but I am just not a big fan of grilled steaks.  The others with me really enjoyed there steaks though.
  What I really Thinks Needs to Be improved - the noise level.  My gosh, we had 5 at our table and couldn't hear anyone but those at our sides.  Our poor waitress had to walk next to each person to take our orders.  Would  seriously recommend they hang some tapestries or something from the ceiling and/or add some decorations that will help absorb sound."}
{"text":"We stopped by Firebirds after seeing a friend in Peoria on my birthday last Friday.  To our amazement there was an open table in the bar on a slammed Friday night.  I'm not sure if it is, but it felt a bit chain-ish to me.  

We split a crunchy chicken salad and a burger and both were good, but not something I would drive back there for.  I liked the look and feel of the place, reminded me a bit of the NW.  Overall a nice dinner, but nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Before my wife got pregnant, this use to be our favourite place for summer cocktails. She loves the wood fired salmon. I switch it up between bacon wrapped fillet mignon and chicken or other. The BLT salad is incredible. The Tater tots are awesome, although my wife thinks they aren't super classy. :)"}
{"text":"Went to the Northlake Mall in Charlotte.  Stopped here for lunch at Firebirds.  Sat outside at first.  Flies aplenty!  Asked to go inside, place was empty and they wanted to seat us in the bar right next to another couple.  Asked for a real table!  Salad was huge, drenched in dressing.  Ordered grilled salmon on top.  Very disappointing.  Thin piece of salmon, stuck to the skin.  Either dry or not that fresh.   Waitress did as how we like our meal, told her \"eh\", but didn't have the time to switch it out.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Very modern decor with high ceilings and exposed beams.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere here.  It felt clean and well-organized.  I also enjoyed the view at the back of the restaurant where you could see the kitchen.  

I found the food delicious.  The bread was indeed a treat.

I went with the BLT salad and added wood-fired chicken.  The dressing was to die for! They didn't smother it and everything tasted extremely fresh.  The portion was a bit large though and I ended up bringing a lot home.

My boyfriend had their burger and found the bacon to be supremely seasoned and the perfect texture.   He is a burger lover and this one it near the top of his list.

Would love to return and try other meals here."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Stumbled upon it after leaving top golf and are so happy we did! My filet mignon was absolutely perfect and my wife loved her salad! On top of that our service by scott was top notch, and being a server myself i really appreciate it! Definitely will be back! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Coming from a yelper who frequents 5 star restaurants - this place is truly average. Nothing about the entire experience was extraordinary but it was still decent. But to be honest I'm not here to talk about the food, I'm here to make light of the female dress code. The staff is forced to wear silver concho belts that are distractingly trashy. It throws off the entire \"expensive\" vibe they're going for. Whoever makes the women wear these western dangly belts should be shamed. I know you're reading this thinking, \"who cares?\". Well, I cared enough to leave a review about it. I didn't have the guts to tell the manager how unappealing it was. It makes you feel like you're right in an Outback Steakhouse. I really hope the manager reads this and removes the belt law. I'm sorry for being judgmental but we are leaving reviews here."}
{"text":"We picked this place for a work dinner since the menu was extensive.     We ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees and I really can't complain about the food.   It was solid, not super fancy, but more like a Cheesecake Factory chain restaurant.   BUT.... I still dream about the Crème Brule cheesecake.  Holy cheesecake that is good.  We ended up ordering another cheesecake because I just needed to eat more.  Another standout is the lemonade.  It's not overly sweet and supports Alex's Lemonade stands.   Good lemonade for a good cause. Kudos."}
{"text":"Sweetie & I sat at a nice table in the bar area.  It gets busy in there, but the tables aren't on top of each other, so the noise doesn't get too overwhelming.  

The bar area also has a cushy bench by a fireplace for people to wait for their tables & it's away from the entry door, so that is a nice feature.

They brought out this bread that has a very distinctive shape to it which we thought was funny, but we cut into it, DELISH! & asked for another.

Sweetie had the small filet & I had the sirloin.  I like \"blue\" steak, so my rare came out perfectly.  Sweetie asked for medium, but his was as rare as mine.  His filet was seasoned better than my sirloin.  The spicy pecan green beans weren't spicy at all, which suits me & they were not too crisp with plenty of small chunks of the pecan.

The server was very nice, but she easily overlooked us even when we were getting the attention of the people she was currently helping, but not her attention.  That happened a couple of times and she disappeared for a good 20-30 minutes towards the end of our meal and we had to ask another server to find her for us. 

If she had been more available we probably would have ordered another drink and dessert & coffee, but we just didn't feel like hanging out anymore after that.

We would probably go again."}
{"text":"This is a nice little date spot.
There is dim lighting and the staff is always pleasant. 

I tend to go with the burger and green chili mac and cheese on the side but the last time I was here they took the mac and cheese off as a side with the burger :(
I liked the mac and cheese with a burger here more than I did from from rehab burger. 
The pasta is good here as well."}
{"text":"We coerced my mom into going to dinner here to surprise her with out of town family for a milestone birthday as she'd mentioned she liked the place. I thought it would be Outback Steakhouse-ish since it's a chain restaurant but was pleasantly surprised. Our waiter Tom was awesome - friendly, patient, and helpful. I was the one vegetarian at the table (*blush, cower*) and Tom suggested something for me that wasn't on the menu which was fantastic: vegetable skewers with a balsamic reduction and a side salad. The rest of the table had various cuts of steak and sides, and everyone was happy with their meal. All the drinks we ordered (a range of beer, wine and cocktails) were delish. They even brought out some ice cream with a birthday candle for my ma. The ambiance is nice but casual and there's a separate bar area. My one complaint would be it's pretty darn dark in there, I saw an older fella using his camera flashlight to see the menu :D I give this Firebirds location 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Visited for a late lunch last week and tried the Steak Au Poivre.  It came sliced, with an amazing peppercorn cream sauce and choice of potatoes (default is either baked potato or mashed, but I chose fries).  Delicious table bread and butter.  Friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp are amazing , make sure to leave enough room for the slaw that comes with the appetizer."}
{"text":"Firebirds is a solid choice for dinner in the Chandler area. Service is friendly and relatively quick. The restaurant is well maintained and clean.  They have a fairly diverse menu, but the most popular are steaks and seafood.  I usually get the sesame salmon, which is excellent. It comes with fried spinach (OMG!) and mashed potatoes. I love this dish! The steaks are pretty damn good too, but you can find better in the area. They have a nice selection of beer, wine, and cocktails and look out for the specials (1/2 off wine when we were there on a Monday night!). Prices are reasonable for the quality of food, atmosphere, and service.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Birthday celebration involved a large group.  Apps were good, drinks as well.  Service went downhill after the appetizers were served.  Couple of servers seemed to be inexperienced.  Ordered shrimp & chicken salads...nice presentation but took forever to get them.  Steaks were prepared correctly but seemed awfully small to be 7 oz.
Cheesecake was wonderful.
Biggest negative was the wait time for our entrees."}
{"text":"Pretty good shrimp and strawberry salad and steak in peppercorn reduction. They're next to the mall so I had lower expectations for them but was pleasantly surprised.

My friend's kid was all about their bread. He could not stop talking about it and I'll give him,  they had good bread."}
{"text":"Server was attentive, Kitchen was slow. Food was VERY salty. We sat in back next to kitchen and it's awkwardly set up so that I could see right into the prep kitchen and all the staff chaos. Five stars for our server and the bomb bread that looks like a butt."}
{"text":"Our meal was outstanding!!!  My steak was cooked to perfection and my family all enjoyed theirs too. We have never been disappointed by the food here and the service is always excellent. The ambiance is amazing and we'll be back."}
{"text":"First off, restaurant was clean and inviting.  We got there around 4:30 PM and was seated immediately. Even when we left around 6:30, there was still plenty of seating available.

Hostess was pleasant and friendly, server was exceptional.  Her name was Victoria and she did everything you would want from a server and more.  Didn't have to ask for drink refills, took our order and made sure everything was served to our preference, friendly, courteous, professional and yet kept everything real.  Victoria did not rush us, always asked if there was anything else we wanted/needed, and made sure we were satisfied. Stayed to talk about her and the restaurant at our musing but still kept a lively pace throughout the evening with all the other tables she was serving.

Watching the rest of the staff do their thing, this place got crowded and busier as the evening progressed.  Saw multiple servers serving an almost packed dining room and they didn't skip a beat.  The only negative I could give this place, if I had to, is that I didn't notice a manager or person in charge.  Maybe they don't need one, if everyone is doing their jobs so efficiently. It would have been nice for him/her to come around and say, \"Hello\" and see how satisfied we were with everything. We were ready to give rave reviews on every aspect of our visit!

As far as food is concerned...it was beyond words. We all wanted to try some prime cuts of meat so we ordered the ribeyes and, at the recommendation of Victoria, the prime rib.  Ribeyes were delicious.  Cooked to perfection, juicy, just the right amount of rare/medium rare you want to get the juices to work with the marbling of the cut.  Outstanding flavor and a good sized portion.

The prime rib...I don't know how to explain it.  I got the smaller cut because I also ordered the Caesar salad and a bowl of the clam chowder and had dessert before the meal.  Wish I had ordered the larger cut. It was out of this world delicious.  I have never had a cut of beef that was so tender, so juicy, so flavorful, so incredibly mouthwatering, so easy to cut (I was cutting it with my fork), so outstanding that I know where I will go out for steak/prime rib every time I am in the Charlotte area.  I didn't have to, but reluctantly shared a bite with my friends of the Prime Rib that they said it was hard to go back to their Ribeyes. The Prime Rib was so incredible, along with everything else about this visit that my friends and I joked about the Prime Rib is Victoria's Secret!

Absolutely, the best choice we could have made for our meals and the fortune to have Victoria as our server.  

Not only do I recommend trying this place but if you have the good fortune of having Victoria (or any of the servers, based on what we saw), you will have an incredible evening and one of your most fantastic meals of your life!"}
{"text":"Firebirds is always a solid go to! Never had a bad meal here! Slightly pricey but they do have some less expensive things on the menu as well!"}
{"text":"$7 for water & a Coke. Waitstaff was unable to assist in finding a menu item without dairy. Manager declined visiting the table when server requested it. Finally searched online and discovered even their fries have dairy. Kitchen was unwilling to discuss menu. This was at 3pm in the afternoon with a full staff and 90% of the tables open."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find a lunch menu that was affordable and tastes great. Took my team from work to lunch and even had dessert and didn't break the bank. Server (Kelly i think) was wonderful, and attentive and had an amazing table side manner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This gets my best salad in the city award.  their fried chicken salad is sooooo good.  topped with their home made balsamic and its just awesome.  They also have some other very solid food.  Great family atmosphere... its not gormet but I crave this salad regularly and have a great time there with the kids."}
{"text":"I love firebirds! Nice clean and friendly environment. Very fancy and you don't break the bank dining in here! One of the better places in town to get a steak. Try the cilantro chicken! That's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Not all that bad but not all that great. They have a pretty good deal on half-priced drinks on Wednesdays, and their wait staff is friendly and accommodating, however, if you make reservations, add about 15-20min to the time you reserved! Their host staff will forget you if you don't remind them you are waiting on your reserved table! Entree rank about 7/10. Okay for a date or group; not really a \"bar\" spot...bar isn't the largest to chill with a few friends; people waiting for their tables congest it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times, and have tried most of the menu. The hostesses are very friendly, and it is very easy to book a reservation. 
The waiters, and waitresses are very professional, and attentative. As well as very knowledgeable of the food and drink menu. The atmosphere is very calming, and enjoyable.
The food at Firebirds is always delectable and well prepared. My top favorites are the Mahi Mahi tacos, lobster queso, Delmonico steak, meatloaf, any hamburger, and the big daddy chocolate cake.

I hope you go relax, and enjoy your best meal EVER!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant while visiting my bestie in Charlotte.  It's a local chain from what I can tell.  Typical American fare.  We dropped in for Lunch on a saturday.

It's at the Northlake mall, so there is plenty of parking, albeit not close, but there is definitely PLENTY of parking.  There is also complementary valet parking out front.  But keep in mind, this is valet for two restaurants and anyone else at the mall.  We had issues when we were trying to retrieve the car because there was one guy trying to get the cars and park cars by himself.

Inside, the restaruants has tons of booths, rocky wall decor and very much like a fancy hotel in the woods.

After looking over the menu, all of us ended up getting a soup and salad lunch combo with a baked potato soup and a salad.  I ended up ordering fries to share as well.

Overall the food was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Service was EXCELLENT.  Our server was great with us and our separate checks and the baby in tow."}
{"text":"The mixed greens salad is a must, but I recommend you get the dressing on the side.  They are very generous with the dressing and if you are eating a salad you may want the nutrients but also the low calorie benefit.  With all the sauce I believe the calories are substantially increased, but so is the flavor.

NY Strip steak was cooked to order.  They overcooked the thinnest two inches of steak but the rest of it was properly cooked.  The dogs benefited from the dry portion as it ended up being fed to them.

The baked potato.  It took two tries to get it mostly right.  I asked for only one dairy - sour cream.  That means no cheese and no butter.  I got a potato with one dairy: butter.  I asked for a replacement and it arrived sans butter, and with sour cream.  It was also sitting on top of cheese.  Loose cheese indeed but it was stuck all over half of the bottom of the potato.  I was able to pick it off.  I wish a bit of attention to detail like not splashing cheese all over the plate prior to putting a potato on it was taken.

The waiter was very nice, drink refills were a bit slow, but I did have a real thirst on me that night."}
{"text":"I do enjoy Firebirds, it reminds me almost of a Flemming's or Keg but is just a bit more casual. I ordered the club sandwich with tater tots, the portion was HUGE! The average \"lunch dish\" is around $12-16 but will surely fill you up. We had wonderful service for a rather large group during the lunch rush and everyone really enjoyed their meal. They offer an awesome happy hour menu and have a beautiful patio. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Me and my family all came to firebirds for my girlfriends birthday the food was delicious but unfortunately my girlfriends step dad found a hair in his food killed the whole mood the manager did come talk to us and stated she would substitute the plate for another or something else but he had refused the manager did minus his plate from the bill this is the second time I've come to firebirds and sadly this may be my last it's sad great customer service great food great alcohol but I'm scared I might find a piece of someone in my plate:( firebirds unfortunately you get a 3 out of 5...you would of had a 5 out of 5 but your follicle ruined it D:"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this location for many years and I am new to yelp.   I felt compelled to write a review due to my frustration with the drink prices at Firebirds.   On a recent visit, myself and my wife split a NY Strip which was delicious and plenty of food for the both of us as we both ordered a salad.   The food here is solid about 80% of the time although I have had a less than adequate steak on occasion for the price ($28 for a strip).   However, my rating has been downgraded due the ridiculous prices they charge for a glass of wine.   My wife ordered two glasses of house merlot and when we got the bill, I was stunned to see the price at $11 per glass.  Never again.   What a waste for a below average glass of house wine.    Order a $6 beer instead."}
{"text":"I love Firebirds and now especially this location. I always go to Arrowhead because it is close to home but Chandler is close to work. I would like to say that the management at chandler does a fantastic job providing customer service and it shows by the attitudes of the servers and bartenders. I was very disappointed when the cucumber martini was taken off the menu last year (back now I understand) and the Blue cheese mushroom burger. I was told at Arrowhead (in a very unfriendly way) that I could not get the burger or martini anymore. However when I was at the Chandler location the bartender who was extremely customer oriented and provided high quality service, told me they can always make the cucumber martini and Blue cheese mushroom burger if requested. I already ordered my wine so I asked for the burger and it was make for me last week. Kudos to the staff at Chandler Firebirds. Maybe the management there can go up to Arrowhead and provide some customer service training."}
{"text":"I continue to enjoy Firebirds for Dinner and happy hours. I am hoping corporate decides to put the cucumber martini back on the happy hour menu. The bartenders and manager confirmed that it is popular for happy hour. Corporate must not understand that it can be the reason people like me stop in so often. Lots of good happy hours in the area so I may have to fine another regular spot to dine."}
{"text":"Wow. Excellent meal and restaurant. Beautiful atmosphere and the food! Wow the rib eye was great.  Coconut shrimp was delicious and the wait staff was outstanding.  Will most DEFINITELY come back."}
{"text":"On vacation and found this great restaurant on YELP.  We went back for a 2nd time before we left from Charlotte.  Both times were wonderful.  We had Rebecca as our waitress.  What a sweet waitress.  She was so nice and made the experience even better.  I had the salmon both times.  The salmon came with mixed veggies and wonderful parmesan mashed potatoes.  My husband had the French dip the 2nd time and loved it.  The bread comes out hot and is delicious.  The dessert is even more scrumptious!  We had the key lime pie twice.  So creamy and light!  Rebecca bought our dessert.  We were totally happy when we left as our stomachs were satisfied from the beginning to the end.  Very reasonable prices for such quality meals!  I was told they are opening restaurants around the US.  Will be looking for them & hopes they will be coming around us or some of our vacation spots."}
{"text":"I first learned of Firebirds a couple years ago by \"Lets try something new.\"  That new place because a favorite of mine in Chandler.  I would go as to say this is probably the best steak Ive had in town.  

When you first pull int the parking lot, you can smell the grill from a mile away.  Just an incredible smell.  Thinking about it right now makes me want to jump into my car and head over there.

The staff is very nice there and of course like all fine dining places, everyone there looks like they stepped off of GQ and Vogue Magazines. The place has a nice steakhouse feel to it.  Wood all over, deer head mounted on all, and you can see the cooks making your food right in the back.  Always nice to see what's going on with the food.  

The things I love most about this place is their bread.  Fresh sour dough loaves that come out piping hot with butter.  I call it \"Butt Bread;\" for those who have been here, you know why.  Best bread Ive had at a restaurant.

Another great addition is their BLT salad.  They have this great garlic ranch dressing that I have not seen anywhere else.  That with bacon bits, lettuce and tomato... delicious.

My personal favorite is their rib-eye and their dipped in, loaded baked potato.  I get the same thing every time now.  Yes I have tried other things and they were amazing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.

My parents went with my girlfriend and I once and my dad ate 3 loaves of the bread himself.  Yeah... good stuff."}
{"text":"After living at the location in Chandler (which i miss), we decided to hit up this location.  I love Firebirds regardless of location.  It's seriously the best steak I've eaten. (yea yeah..  I know I haven't been everywhere).  For a chain it's great.

We show up about 6PM expecting the \"OH it'll be 45minutes to an hour\" wait.. But they offer us the outside with heated lamps.  So we take it.  Ohhh those lamps were nice.  We sit down and our waitress quickly shows up and takes our drink orders.  I ask for extra butter for our butt bread.. Yes I call it butt bread.  If you've been to Firebirds, you know why.  Anyway, i love butter, and Firebirds bread is the BEST pre-dinner bread in the world. 

The three of us split the BLT salad and quickly devour it fast along with the bread.  Then we order our entrees.  I forget what my friends ordered, but I got my favorite; the Ribeye. Mmmmm.. With a baked potato.  Which are awesome.

When my food finally arrives, I quickly mash all the goods into my potato and start going to town on it. That's when I notice. \"wow.. this potato isnt that good.\"   The toppings were ok, but the potato just seemed a bit dry.  Something I haven't experienced in a Firebirds before.  So for the first time in my FB experience, I did not finish the potato.. :(
I hit my steak next and made quick work of it.

Good location, I was hopin for a yummier potato.  Is that worth three stars?  Probably not, but I can always change it later on right?"}
{"text":"Great food and drink... plus excellent professional service. Ask for Aristotoe or Kayelynn. Matt [GM] is quite cordial and helpful. The House Napa Cabernet Sauvignon Blend and Chardonnay are a super value... made by the owner's Napa winery. The early bird menus and Monday half off all wines is a steal. You won't regret dining here. We have entertained over 30 guests here this year, and they all loved it!"}
{"text":"Long a favorite, this week's visit was especially pleasing since we went on a Monday...  and hit half priced wines! Melissa was the perfect server; so I asked if she will be there on the 15th when we return with more friends. She is efficient and fun... always there at the right time with the service that makes a dinner really special.
We found Firebirds by chance and learned that it was founded and owned by a friend since we were 12 years old. Leslie Rudd also own a winery in Napa and had some of his wines on the list when we first visited for luncheon many years ago. My wife noticed this and asked about it... and as a result, we have been ordering his house red wine since... it is spectacular!
Also delicious and special is the BLT Salad... and most of their entee's. We devoured the tasty desserts. If you join their club, you receive special offers and bonuses... in this case a $10 discount. Also worth noting is the early dinner menu, which is quite reasonably priced and offers a generous array of meals... both salad an entree! Check out theit website... and then hop over to dine... and don't forget to request Melissa as your server!"}
{"text":"I love salmon, and this place had incredible wine for half-price on Thursdays. Put that with some good friends and great conversation, and I'll forever have a soft spot in my heart for Firebirds."}
{"text":"My last review for here was 2 1/2 years ago, I think it's time I updated it.  Well, we come here a lot, it's definitely one of our favorites.  We have yet to have a bad meal, or a bad server.  Today was no exception.  We were off of Bell Rd. and looking for somewhere to head for a late lunch.  We both decided to drive around the area and see what appealed to us.  As soon as we passed by, we looked at each other, and without a word, hubby pulled into the parking lot.

Since it was before 4pm, they were serving lunch.  Hubby went with a cheeseburger (they're always so good here) and since it was so hot out today, I went with the fried chicken salad.  Other than the pre-meal salad, I hadn't tried one of their salads as an entree.  Well, it was wonderful!  It's mixed greens, tomatoes, carrots, jicama, tempura chicken tenders and honey mustard dressing.  It came with 4 big tenders, which I cut up and mixed into the salad.  It was refreshing, and even with the chicken, felt very light.  Bonus, it's served with an ice cold fork!!  I would definitely get it again!

They've kept their track record perfect for us...we'll be seeing them again sometime soon!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Doug V. This place is great! I really need to find out what type of bread they serve, because it is heavenly!

I've had the NY strip and the hamburger. I have the hardest time deciding which I want to order because they are both excellent! 

There's usually a long wait on the weekend nights, but worth the wait for me. Call ahead if you are coming on the weekend to get your name on the list after 6pm.

There's another location at Northlake mall. I've been to both, and both are excellent.

Great spot for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Update 4/27/13
We visited Firebird's again this evening.  We had a wonderful dinner. My husband and I sat at a table in the bar area and were promptly greeted by our server. She was extremely helpful, polite and did not mind answering all our questions. We ordered some beer + a double shot of whiskey for my husband and champagne for myself for drinks with the lobster queso for the appetizer, which by the way was amazing. For dinner I had the sesame salmon and my husband had the 14oz NY strip. The salmon was some of the best salmon I have ever had, I was very pleased with my meal. Perfectly cooked with great flavor. My husband's steak was very flavorful, however, there was quite a bit of gristle which was inedible..... But the parts we ate were delicious. We were very happy with our visit this time, our server was excellent and the food was great. I'm glad that Firebird's were able to make things right and bring us back as guests.

Update 4/16/13
I was contacted by a representative from Firebird's, and was offered a gift card to make things right. Hopefully they come through and we have a much better experience on our next visit. Will update again after our next visit.

Original review 3/31/13
My husband and I came here for our anniversary. Food was good, I did not expect less for the price... So I'm glad the food was good. Service was lacking. Our server was slooooooowww, and nowhere to be found most of the time. She was so slow, our appetizer came out before our drinks. No sorry, not even any excuses. All the stars are for the food..... I used to love this place, but the poor service will keep me from returning."}
{"text":"In town for business and stopped in for lunch and was well pleased. 

Location-near downtown and inside was very nice. 

Service-Amazing waitress, she brought our group drinks without us asking and was very attentive to us. 

Food-smoked wings were very good. Bacon vinaigrette was fantastic and will order again."}
{"text":"I took my aunt there for Mother's Day. Our server was friendly and helpful. We ordered the coconut shrimp for an appetizer and it was great. We ordered filet mignon and ate their wonderful bread while we waited. My steak came out perfect but my aunt's was way over cooked. We mentioned it to our waitress and she offered to take it and bring a new steak. She was very pleasant. A few minutes later the manager came over and apologized and asked my aunt if she would like something while we waited like a cup of soup ot salad. When her steak came out, it was perfect. We enjoyed our meal and the courtesy of the staff. When our bill came, the manager had removed my aunt's steak from the bill. 

Every restaurant messes up but how they handle it makes a huge difference. I would recommend both the food and the service!!!"}
{"text":"Basic restaurant with decent service attached  to a mall. I mean really do you need anymore than that. Nuf said."}
{"text":"So let me start this review by saying, this was not my original destination.  I was looking for a good place to take a client for a business dinner and needed some very specific things.  So after searching around for a restaurant with good tables, Wifi and a Gluten Free menu, I came across Firebirds.  I called to verify the Wifi and Gluten free menu and see if I could make a reservation at a table near an outlet for the laptop.  They were extremely friendly about the request and very accommodating.
Our party arrived at the restaurant and confirmed the reservation at the front.  We were greeted by a friendly host and were seated immediately.  Initially, I like the look of the place.  I'm usually very critical of the architecture and design but this place a had a nice feel, it was not overly decorated and the lighting was well done and gave the right mood.
Our server was at the table very fast and got our drink orders going right away.  We requested the Gluten Free Menu for our client and the server was able to answer all our questions about the menus.  We all ended up ordering the Filet Mignon dinner and the waiter worked with us to find a Gluten Free cocktail for our client.  The food was out within a reasonable time and was fantastic.  All of us had nothing but good things to say about the steak, mine was one of the best I ever had and much better than some I've paid three times as much for!
This is where it gets interesting:  We had a catastrophe of epic proportions!!  Our client, mid meal, knocked his martini glass into his plate, shattering the glass all over his steak and spilling his drink all over himself.  He went outside to smoke and calm his frustration in himself.  While he was gone, the waiter came by to clear the mess and had the manager come over to talk to us.  They immediately replaced his drink, with almost no prompting from us, and replaced his meal free of charge!!  The chef personally delivered the replaced dish and the manager personally came by to make sure everything else was to our satisfaction.  When they delivered the check, everything was perfect and we were given a gift card for the trouble (trouble we had caused!).
In my experience, the customer service here was better than any place I've been.  I will definitely go back to this restaurant.  Thanks to the manager, Shawn, and our server, Corbin, we had a great experience here and they have our business."}
{"text":"We dined here on 1/21 for my birthday. We have been here a few times and they have been mixed experiences. This one was no different really. We had made reservations but showed up early, because our plans had changed a little bit. Well, we were told that we wouldn't be sat until our reservation time- which was going to be an hour after we actually arrived. I wouldn't have minded being put on a wait list or something, as if we hadn't made reservations, but the two hostesses were kind of going back and forth about it. They honestly weren't as busy as we expected so I 

Luckily, two spots opened up at the bar and we just chose to eat there and avoid drama. Just disappointing since it was a birthday dinner. There were three bartenders and when we first sat down we had to wait a little bit to get our drink order taken but other than that, they were all rock stars! They were all personable, made sure our drinks were refreshed, and didn't even bat an eye when I asked for something that isn't 100% on the menu anymore. As far as the food? It was PERFECT!!! I don't even have words to describe it other than that. Was just how we wanted it and was delicious!

If I had seen a manager, I would have mentioned the bad experience with the hostesses (I've been a hostess before and my husband has worked in restaurants too- customers shouldn't be treated like that) as it started our experience on a sour note. But the bartending/kitchen staff was awesome and redeemed my birthday evening!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I want to love Firebirds. It's within 10 minutes of our house and so close to Southpark mall, Earthfare and the Barnes and Nobles. But sadly, it has consistently fallen short when we don't just stop in for drinks. 

The positives - location, decor, and drinks. I've already spoken about it's convenient location. The inside decor is very nice and laid back, and I love the bar area with the fireplace that you can sit next to while enjoying a cocktail when it's chilly outside. The drink menu is also very good. You absolutely have to try the Black Diamond drink. If you've ever had a Stoli Doli from Capital Grille, it's the same thing but with Sky Vodka instead of Stoli. Basically, a juice box for adults. Love it...but be careful; they'll sneak up on you if you have more than one. 

The negatives - dining room service and food. The service at the bar is just fine, but when you get into the dining room, the service level drops off significantly. The food is also well below par for the price range. We started with the chicken quesadilla, which was okay, and I ordered the fish of the day as my main course. It Mahi Mahi and was to come with sauteed spinach and tomato and parmesan mashed potatoes. They brought my dinner out and it was literally swimming in tomato sauce (which effectively destroyed the mashed potatoes). The fish was prepared well, and the spinach and tomato pieces were also very good...I'm just not sure why they would drown it in tomato juice. 

In the end, this is a great restaurant for drinks and possibly appetizers, but I would recommend heading to another restaurant in the area if you're looking for a full meal with good service."}
{"text":"After a recent visit here with my parents, husband, and sister I just had to write an update and give them an extra star. In spite of a few picky eaters in the group everyone was extremely happy with their meals.  Even my 7 year old nephew! Apparently they have a great kids menu... who knew?

This is not really my go-to restaurant since I usually prefer more ethnic or unique food.  But their all-American menu with a wide variety of well-prepared dishes makes them the perfect place to bring out of town guests.  Steaks, chops, salads... and for lunch a variety of burgers that are all fantastic with those wonderfully tasty sweet potato waffle fries!  I also am very addicted to their bread and the lobster cheese dip appetizer.

The service is always good.  Competent and friendly but still formal enough that you don't feel like you are at TGIFridays.  Even the decor is sort of a chain but not a chain.  A few stuff on the walls to make it clear that they have a theme but not overly kitchy.  Over the last few years we have taken a lot of people here and everyone always leaves happy.

Well done, Firebirds!"}
{"text":"Four of us went there. One got the salmon. It was very good. Another got the filet. Overcooked. Another got the Mahi. Completely flavorless. I got the trout. Ate one piece, took the other one home so I can doctor it up and actually put some flavor in it. We let our waitress know and she said she informed the managers. Neither of them came to the table afterwards."}
{"text":"Today we went back to try lunch. It wasn't a total disappointment but still underwhelming. However I will say the customer service is really good. I appreciate that. I ordered the hamburger which is good,  my daughter the pasta which wasn't the best and my other daughter ordered their fried chicken salad..."}
{"text":"The service here was a little slow. The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was pretty nice. The food was very tasty. The hamburger here was good and I was pretty impressed. The bread they give you is addicting and you will keep wanting more. The pasta here was also above average and I would recommend it. The price was little high then most but not by much."}
{"text":"I chose Firebirds as my birthday dinner. It's a bit spendy, but not the most expensive steakhouse in the area. I promptly signed up for the email club and even though I got the birthday coupon for $10 off the night before my birthday, it still read, \"happy belated birthday.\" I gave it to the waitress and told her it's actually my birthday today, but she still kept saying \"belated birthday\" lol. So as for the experience and the food... We went without a reservation and got a table as a party of two in less than 5 minutes. It's dimly lit and looks to be more of a casual dress place. The panella bread with butter was delicious! Sure, it's not the soft rolls with honey butter from another steakhouse (my husband likes those better), but I think it's just as tasty! My prime rib was soooo good and the au jus was salted perfectly. I opted for a baked potato and sautéed spinach as my sides.  The prime rib comes with a potato already, but it's $6 for any additional side. I probably had enough to eat, but really wanted a vegetable (even if it was coated in oil and topped with cheese). The food and service were great and I even learned of a food I've never tried. Jicama. We thought they were onions and picked them out of the salad lol."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Great atmosphere, great staff and great food.  They have a good variety on the menu.  The steaks are good.  They have good burgers.  Baby backs are great.  My wife loves the salmon here and usually gets it with a Caesar salad."}
{"text":"A fantastic lunch, and my favorite was the amazing cocktail I enjoyed.  I cannot remember the name of it but it's the pomegranate drink under the martinis, not to be missed!  

My husband enjoyed a steak and said it was really good, my mom loved her pecan trout, but she didn't love the slaw that comes with it.  My son enjoyed his Chicken tenders, they even come with a little package of two oreos!  The potatoes are delicious!!! Oh and the bread that comes at the beginning of your meal is really tasty as well. 

I can't wait to try dessert next time.

Also service was AMAZING!  We will absolutely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Happy hour at Firebirds must haves: The Double Black Diamond; fresh pineapple infused for 21 days with lemon vodka, and the Passion Basil Mule; a delicious spin on the traditional Moscow Mule. The lobster spinach queso is by far our favorite starter to share!"}
{"text":"The place definitely has that franchise feel but I was really impressed with my meal at Firebirds. My husband and I both ordered the Prime Rib, I with the loaded mashed potatoes and he with a baked potato. It was honestly the best Prime Rib I've ever had! It was so flavorful and cooked perfectly Med-Rare. It was served with delicious au jus and a spicy horseradish cream. I also loved the mashed potatoes which came server recommended...and were worth every calorie (and boy was there calories!) 

They also had really great Wednesday drink specials including $5 martinis, $2 off draft beer. They had some local options which was great so I enjoyed a very-reasonably priced Bird Song IPA. 

I am excited to return and will happily get the exact same thing!"}
{"text":"I dont think the price is worth the food. I asked for my gorgonzola steak medium rare and got it bloody red rare. I would have asked them to take it back and cook it some more but the gorgonzola cheese would be an absolute disaster for that. Others complained about their steak.

I would rather cook myself or go to outback... or any other high end steakhouse in the same price range."}
{"text":"Love the bleu cheese filet and the bread!!! So delicious. I wish they had better desserts, but that's my only complaint. Good ambiance with low lighting. Did I mention the bread? Nom nom nom!!!!"}
{"text":"Two words: Awe. Some!

This place is great! Came here with some friends/co-workers for \"Wine Monday.\" The wine was great (and reasonably priced). I ordered the Pepper Sirloin Steak, and man was that good! Nice and juicy and full of flavor. I highly recommend it!

The ambiance is also really nice. It has this comfortable feel to it where you can sit there, enjoy your food, and visit with your friends. It is a bit expensive, but that's to be expected for food of this quality. The waiter was really nice and helpful as well.

Overall, I'd recommend this place. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I took my 3 girls to firebirds for a early dinner. Upon arrival, to the front, their was no host at the front. We waited and a host came to address us about our table needs. 
  We sat, and we waited for 5 minutes before our server came over. It wasn't a server but another service staff asking what we wanted for our drinks and your sever will be over shortly, which was good team work. 
      We ordered our meals and the server ask if we needed bread, not if we wanted bread. Any way we requested the bread, to discover it was the frozen butt bread, not made in house. So the bread was not good at all, and should not even been offered. 
    My children's food was not prepared correctly and we did not receive our requested condiments and we had to ask numerous times. Our meals took 30 minutes to come out, never saw a manager, speak to any tables at all to see how his guests were enjoying their meals. 
   Table Maintence was terrible with 3 different staff coming by, and not clearing unless I handed it them. This probably stems from lack of policy implementation.   So we will mostly likely not return,  with the poor service standards and sub par food."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch. Good for businesses or casual event. It could get loud though at times. Service is good and fast."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our 13th Anniversary but my wife was not feeling well.  We had planned to celebrate at Freebirds as we have been there often and always had great service and food. I did have a $10 coupon on a  $40 take out order and our bill came to a bit over $40.  Part of our order was a piece of key lime pie (theirs is great) which the manager threw in as a sort of a gift and he also honored the coupon.  As always the food, even for takeout, was excellent and we will be back often."}
{"text":"What a great meal!!! This place has a great atmosphere and superb food all around. I tried the crab-cakes on the recommendation of another on yelp and have to admit they were very good. The only downside to this dish, was that there were only two crab-cakes on the plate and when they were gone, I was left with a feeling that I wanted more. The sauce for the crab-cakes was delicious and blended well with the crab and was delicately adorned with cabbage and veggies (very nice presentation).  I ordered the Grilled Mahi for the main course that which comes with a pineapple salsa and a side of your choice (my choice was the vegetables). This dish has small chunks of pineapple, served over a perfectly grilled filet that was moist and very flavorful. 
The vegetables were tasty and not under or overcooked (perfection). The service was great too, and our waiter Isaac, was fantastic, prompt and friendly. The manager also paid a visit to our table to ensure our meal and service was perfect (quality control).  My wife had the Ribeye steak and she said it was one of the best she's had. Our two friends also had the Ribeye steak and they also said it was fantastic. This was a great dinner experience with great friends at a great restaurant (3 Gs).
I will definitely return to try other dishes on the menu and will put this place on the rotation. Easy to rate
this place with a perfect \"5\" Stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3x and never have been dissapointed.  It's a nice looking restaurant with a good variety on the menu.  I like that you can substitute sides with no charge.  I have had a hamburger here twice (top notch).  This time i had the parmesan crusted mahi and it was amazing.  The fish was cooked perfectly and a nice portion.  The butter sauce was the perfect complement.  I had the veggies as a side which were fine, but dull."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, but that's a good thing, right?  The food is a bit pricey, but consistently good - and I mean everything.  I'd like to see a few more wine selections, but the ambiance and great food is well-worth the night out.  I like to go there for special occasions - can't really afford it every week.  But I sure wish I could!  Everyone I have sent there has been soooo happy for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Ya know, I can't believe I haven't reviewed these guys yet but honestly it's because I haven't had a \"proper meal\" or entrée here to date. Despite that, I've been here at least five times and I owe them a solid shout-out.

You might be wondering what I've even had here since I've been so many times. Guys. It's the lobster cheese dip. I get it every time I go. And I eat like it IS my MEAL. It's so glorious. I've even gotten two before. I've been known to visit here with my dad and we would gorge ourselves on beer, dip and free bread. Wait, free bread too you say? Yep. Easily one of the best free breads out there for any restaurant. Olive Garden can take a hike!

The service is also stellar. I've only once had a bad experience with the dip - chips were soggy and limp and the dip itself was cold. They comped it AND gave us free desserts for everyone at the table. I mentioned beer above, but wanted to point out they tend to have a pretty good selection of the lesser known ones and local items on tap. If you want to dine here I suggest making reservations ahead of time but if you have a small group they have first-come-first-serve bar seating and high-top seating around the bar.

Last but certainly not least, be warned that there is a price to pay at this fine-dining chain establishment. But frankly, I promise it's worth it."}
{"text":"One word.  Amazing!!! Thats all you need to know.  The food here will blow your socks off.  The service was also great.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So my husband and I decided to go here for our wedding anniversary. When I called the hostess I asked if I could get a private table maybe somewhere in a more quiet area. We have two kids and we never get to have dinner alone and have some peace. Unfortunately they sat us right smack dab in the middle of the restaurant where it was pretty loud. Luckily I ordered the mahi and it was delicious. The mashed potatoes on the side were great too. I was thinking maybe we were going to get a free desert since it was a special occasion but we didn't.. I mean it's ok most other places typically do when you tell them. We will be going back but hopefully the hostess does a better job at following directions."}
{"text":"We had been here several years ago so were just trying it out again.  I had remembered we loved it on our previous visit.  There's a lot of difference in the setting whether you sit inside or sit outside.  We made a huge mistake sitting on the patio.  It was well after the lunch hour but long before dinner hour too.

There are speakers on the patio playing music.  I'm thinking more for a happy hour effect.  However, it wasn't happy hour and all the guests on the patio were trying to talk over the music that was playing.  It was very loud and we even had to scoot ourselves in to hear the two of us at the same table.   Besides that we were fighting flies and received several bites -- mosquitos or some type of biting bug.  We definitely would never sit on the patio again.

Food sizes are huge and very good.   Cole slaw sauce is amazing.  Service was very good except for when we asked for our bill.  It took a while to get it and that's when we realized we had to get out of there before we got more bites.

Menu prices were a little spendy for salads, sandwiches and burgers but then, maybe we didn't get a lunch menu."}
{"text":"The ratings for Firebirds depends on it's competition.  The Sharon Rd location has so much to compete against for the menu.  Difficult thing is, it is an odd niche.  Fantastic vibe to the place.  If the food quality was that of Sullys, Del Friscos, or that level, this place would be crazy good.  The quality of food for the money is good.  In that district, if they had the top teir food, the enviroment supports it.   If you have kids though and you want something nicer than the basic family spots, this would be a good fit.  It all depends on what you are seeking."}
{"text":"First visit to Firebirds. It was OK. My friend and I were seated right away. Although they weren't busy, it did take a few minutes before we were greeted by our server. She was friendly and she helped me decide what to order since I had never before been.

My friend ordered the meatloaf entree and I settled on the smokehouse burger. When my condiments were questioned, I requested ketchup and yellow mustard which were brought out in small receptacles. My burger then arrived without lettuce and tomato, which I though was odd, but apparently that's just how they designed that burger. I flagged down the server and requested those add-ons, and politely obliged.

We both enjoyed our meals. I also enjoyed the strawberry basil lemonade.

I would return."}
{"text":"had a great lunch at this place after some shopping on the black friday with the family... liked the food, happy with the service... loved the environment too!

for appetizers we had crab cakes and buffalo wings, both pretty good... their bacon wrapped filet with grilled shrimp was amazing... so does the fish and sirlon. the best is the desert i think! warm chocolate cake with the vanilla ice cream.... yum yum!

the bus boy dropped the entire order of the wings at our table when he tried to sit it down... then he said 'oh fuck... i am sorry' (exact wordings!) and then use his bare hands to grab each one, put it back into the bowl and say he'll be right back with a new order..... our waitress then found out the incident, just shaked her head..... i'd give this place a 4 star if she apologized for him and say it'd be complimentry, or give us the desert for free or something.... afterall, we watched a drama and had a table full of bufflo sauces.... but.... neh.... 

oh well, it was nice overall... liked it!"}
{"text":"I am normally not a fan of chain restaurants but Firebirds is definitely one I cannot stay away from too long.  When I first moved to Charlotte I worked at the Rae Road location for a few months.  I have pretty much sampled the whole menu and for the most part it is all top notch.  A few items I might stay away from would be the meatloaf (salty, nothing impressive) and the coconut shrimp.  I highly recommend the steaks, burgers (can get them medium-rare! Yum!), Salads, Salmon, and so on.  Of course anything is better when topped with Blue cheese and mushrooms.  I'm not sure why but they stopped serving the Blue cheese potato chips which is a huge bummer.  It was a great way to start the meal.  And if they don't bring the bread make sure you ask for it or you'll be sorry you didn't.  Very warm, tasty bread!

The service is great (should be because they only get like 2-3 tables per person) and the bar is fairly efficient for how busy it usually is.  Biggest recommendation is to call ahead.  It doesn't matter what night, they are typically on a wait and if you don't you will be waiting along time!  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Firebirds a couple of times - and those visits were probably a decade apart. But they were remarkably similar. This means either they have things down to a science, or I have hit on an amazing set of coincidence. Perhaps a bit of both.

The staff at Firebirds is friendly, and the inside of the place is definitely nice to look at - but there are plenty of places that are nice to look at. Doesn't mean you have to hang out there, and even less that you have to spend money there. Wait - I was talking about a restaurant, right?

Anyway - if you go for a drink, you may want to pump this up a notch, because it's pretty worthwhile to hang out inside when you're drinking. It's that nice. If you're there for food, it's a bit underwhelming. It's not bad, exactly, but the pace slows waaay down, the food is middling and the price just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"This place was packed for dinner on a week night so I sat at the bar. The first bar tender had no personality, and she couldn't answer my question about a wine recommendation. Another bar tender overheard it, and covered it perfectly. 

I had a delicious Sesame Salmon dish, which had an Asian flair. I wasn't too sure about the side, which was the fried spinach. It was like a crispy, oily type thing. Picture dehydrated spinach.

The bartender with zero personality was really snobby, but a second one was behind the bar and was very warm and sort of took over, offering me another drink, and preparing my bill. 

Also the 2 girls up at the front, (the hosts) were totally brain dead, snobby, and unwelcoming. The waiter who brought my food was rude and forceful also. Friendly wasn't really the vibe here except for one employee.

They have all of the ladies wear back slinky skirts and this biker sort of chain thing loosely around their waist. As I looked around I wondered what the business model was exactly. I was curious about what theme they were going for. If you were to watch a Firebirds training video, or read their mission statement, I guess maybe you'd see words like \"cool\" or \"sexy.\" maybe that's (supposed to be) the whole idea there. 

Hmm, anyways it was okay. If you are with a group on a weeknight, plan on a 45 minute wait. They can page you on your phone when it's ready."}
{"text":"Kaitlyn was an absolutely incredible server!  Let's start there because we all know a server can make or break one's dining experience - and thus the establishment's Yelp rating.  My son and I brought my hubby here for a birthday lunch so the great service was a welcomed addition to our little celebration.  The food was good - no real complaints there either - but hands down its the experience that made this a positive outing for us.  Thanks, Kaitlyn!"}
{"text":"Looks very busy on the outside but once we got in we sat at the bar area. Atmosphere was nice and warm. Our server was very nice but one thing I noticed was everyone around us had bread but we never got any bread. I got the chicken pasta and it was so delicious!! I would definitely get it again. I liked how the chicken was flavorful and almost shaved. The green onions added a great touch. Boyfriend got the steak and he wasn't very fond of it. He got a really fatty piece and asked for medium rare and it was still really tough to cut. He wasn't impressed with his steak. But I will say, the chicken pasta was awesome! We also got the onion ring appetizer and it was good enough for a table of 4 to share."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick meal at the bar.  Good food and good service.  Decent happy hour."}
{"text":"Recently came here to enjoy a drink with a coworker. Let me tell you! The atmosphere was great and the waiter was on point. He was stalking our cups and making sure it was full the whole time. I ordered a drink (can't remember the name of it now), but it was good and stiff! I left there nice. I had the buffalo chicken tenders whatever, and man was it good!!! I had a great time there. I'll definitely come back. 

S/N: the price was right. Not expensive at all!!"}
{"text":"Me and wifey ate dinner here Memorial Day and took advantage of the free meal for A Veteran. I had the ribs and wife had a salmon dish that was very good. It was some kind of encrusted Salmon that was so good I wish I would have got it instead of ribs. Not taking away anything from the ribs (which were also very good) but should have got the Salmon this trip. The waitress we had was super! Very attentive, in fact she suggested the Salmon dish to my wife who loved it. We started outside and moved inside right when our food came because it was getting dark quickly. I'm glad we moved because it started to rain shortly after we moved. The food was good the service was good, all is good."}
{"text":"Ate dinner at this location last night. Our servers name was Evan and he was great, even with the restaurant packed. This visit was nothing but a positive experience from start to finish. Firebirds made it right. We will go back. Thank you Firebirds!"}
{"text":"Great food. Period. The New York strip was nothing less than amazing BUT I don't think the atmosphere/service matched the price of the food. The food is that of a high-end steakhouse. The atmosphere is similar to a bar or soup kitchen. This place is just plain noisy (people shouting, loud music, and tons of pots clanking due to the open kitchen). It's cool to watch your food being cooked I guess but I really don't want to hear it, especially when I'm paying almost $30 a plate."}
{"text":"Seriously all around great experience- food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better, from the hostess that found us a spot at the bar to our waiter that recommended the most amazing salmon"}
{"text":"Loved it! Bread is hot and delicious, Ceaser salad had amazing croutons and dressing flavor, and the filet was spot on!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary, so we decided on Firebirds.  Hands down Firebirds Wood Fired Grill  in the west valley! Everything on the menu is amazing! 

We got there around 6:30pm hoping that we could be seated before our 7:00pm reservation.  As we walked in the restaurant was PACKED, and people were waiting.  We thought as soon as a seat opened up at the bar we could have a drink.  We did just that!  The bartenders (male with redish hair and a beard and female with long brown hair) were sooooo friendly and fast, even though it was a packed house. You both are a reason why my husband and I will definitely be back just for drinks.  BTW you were right about the double black diamond.  It snuck up on me. Haha!  It was such an amazing drink!!! 

Finally we sat down for dinner and our food was so delicious!! We ordered crab cakes for an appetizer, we will definitely be having that again.  My husband ordered the kabobs and shrimp with mashed potatoes and I had the rib eye with a baked potato (best baked potato ever).  

The last thing I wanted to talk about was Breezy's service. She was such an amazing server.  She was friendly, fast and always had a smile.  I watched her with all of her customers and it was that way all around.  I also wanted to say thank you for the anniversary card which you wrote out in this pretty blue ink.  I loved how you personalized it by wishing us a \"Happy 3rd Anniversary.\"  It made it even more special.  So thank you for that.  

So thank you again to everyone at Firebirds last night for making our night wonderful!"}
{"text":"The good: Monday is half-priced wine night for some types.

The Meh: Who needs another average \"executive\" restaurant?  While I wouldn't ward anyone away from Firebirds, I've never walked away saying that I had to return.  While the atmosphere is good, the food is just average and expensive.  Plus, the portion sizes are insane!  No one needs to eat that much!

Smaller portions, lower prices will allow your patrons to live longer and return to eat again.  Or bring a friend and share a meal."}
{"text":"It's a very nice place. The lobster queso was delicious! It's a must try. The prices here were pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Our fav stop to/from Phoenix to Casa Grande. Food, ambiance and service are great! The Chicken Pasta, Turkey Club and French Dip are our favorites. Can't wait until next spring when they open the Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"I came here to dinner last night and it was my first time dining here. Our server was great and the food was really good, but I was confused about the bread. It was hard as a rock and when I asked the servers they didn't know if it was supposed to be like that. Another thing is that my glass was broken by the rim and I noticed after I was drinking from it. Disappointed that a manager never came to to validate our experience because they would just stand around."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the west valley. The steak is top notch and I highly suggest the creme brule cheesecake. It blows away The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"One of the best Happy Hour spots in town! My friend and I came here for the first time today. We were pretty impressed with their selection and pricing for Happy Hour. We liked mostly everything we had:(drinks $5- $7) Double Black Diamond, Flirtini, Passion Basil Mule. All the above drinks were flavorful, sweet and had the right amount of liquor..where you couldn't really taste it but know it's there. (Food $5- $7) Crispy Shrimp Tacos, Pretzels and cheese, Jalapeño Deviled Eggs. 
The only thing I didn't care for was the beef sliders. I felt that it was lacking flavor.
Our server was Samantha. She was great! Everything she recommended was good when we were unsure (I should've asked her about the sliders).
I would definitely come back. Even for the regular dinner menu. I do recommend coming to the restaurant before 530 for Happy Hour. I went on a Wednesday and it started  getting busy about 530pm."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom while we were in town and most of the experience was good. First, our server looked less than pleased to be there (or at least to be serving us). I dont remember a warm greeting from him or anything of the sort. As I saw other servers checking in on their tables and being friendly with them, that was lacking from our experience. After the meal came out, there was little to no communication until it was time for the check. I would understand if the restaurant was busy but we went around 3pm and it was near empty. 

As for the food, we got the 7 oz bacon wrapped filet Mignon with their steak fries and the sesame encrusted salmon served with mashed potatoes and fried spinach. The food was delicious. I probably wouldn't go for the fries with the steak. Although it was good, I much prefer the mashed potatoes. The salmon was perfectly cooked. It was soft and fell apart when you cut into it. But the fried spinach would be something I sub out next time. My mom enjoyed it because there's a bit of a crunch and it tasted good and was seasoned well but it seemed like it was just encased in oil with each bite leaving a film of it in your mouth. 

I also had the strawberry basil lemonade and it was good. It had a rather strong basil taste which I enjoy but if you don't, I would stay away from it. 

Overall, it was a good meal. Very filling and I would say worth the price. But hopefully you have better service than I did. It did seem like it was just this server and maybe he was just having an off day."}
{"text":"We made it back here to give them another try. While the food wasn't terrible it wasn't amazing either. I stand by my original review. I had to add salt and pepper to my steak because it lacked flavor. Also this piece of prime rib was mostly fat. I cook steaks at home and know all about marbeling and how it gives flavor but there needs to be an even balance between the fat and meat otherwise you just feel ripped off. I still feel going to Outback Steakhouse will give you better tasting steaks with lower prices. The location on Chandler Blvd had never disappointed. Sorry Firebirds you're just not for us."}
{"text":"We went here for New Years Eve. Place was of course packed. We were seated at a small (REALLY SMALL) table pushed into a corner. Had to slide it around and take care to it not hit the guests next to me. Took a really long time to get served due to the day I guess. When I spend that kind of money, definitely expect much more. Could have gone to Texas Roadhouse three times for the price and had much better care with similar food. Not happy."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant anywhere.the best prime rib ,iced tea, and the best cheesecake anywhere in the United States. We went to New York City in December tried every cheesecake in Manhatten  and Little Italy  they don't even compare to Firebirds . We go out to dinner literally every night this restaurant has the most fabulous food.you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Service was also great! Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Ruth and I had lobster queso, BLT salad and prime rib and filet. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food but very noisy! Impossible to have a conversation. Other than that, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"1st time at Firebirds the other day for lunch.  Wasn't too impressed when I walked in. Lots of people, poor acoustics.  Was seated with no waiting which is a plus.  Tried the colorado chicken salad and was very happily surprised.  Tasty.  Service was good; Michael was very attentive to our threesome.  Will try it again."}
{"text":"1st time customer. Sat at bar and ordered 2 black diamond martinis which was incredible.  Food subpar. Ordered the chili delmonico but wasn't expecting a baseball size one.  Service sucked and bartenders were overwhelmed and slow as a turtle. Would not visit again. Sad to call yourself a 
\"Steakhouse\".  Take a pass and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great location if you're coming from a spring training game at Peoria! We each ordered a burger and both were delicious. I liked the seasoned fries, but I want to try the other options next time to see what I was missing. The best part of the meal though, was the fresh out of the oven bread they gave us as an appetizer. I could've eaten the whole loaf myself! :)

Our server was very attentive and refilled our waters repeatedly and without complaint. We enjoyed ourselves and I can't wait to go in for a steak!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Firebirds location a few times, and it is very solid overall. In my experience their steaks seem to be very good, the burgers are awesome, and the meatloaf is excellent. The service is pretty average usually and prices (aside from the burgers which are surprisingly cheap) are a little higher than what's justifiable. Overall not my favorite option at South Park but a solid choice."}
{"text":"Visiting the 'rents for the weekend in good ol SC and they took me here for dinner! This place was very busy and very delishous! The bar was hoppin but the wine we ordered was awesome. Monday is half price wine night so duh! I ordered the Lobstah Spinach dip and the woodfired Salmon. Super good! Get the pecan stringbeans. They were amazebslls. Service was excellent too. We'll def be back to this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but I LOVE Firebirds. I changed it up a little bit and started with a house salad instead of the BLT salad. It was tasty, but I prefer the BLT.

Firebirds is the one place where I always, ALWAYS order a drink. And it's usually the same drink: the black diamond martini. It's a pineapple martini and is made by soaking wedges of fresh pineapple in vodka for like 7 days. This is my favorite drink of all time. 

For my entree I went with my all time favorite: the wood grilled salmon, Parmesan mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables. The salmon is so delicious. It was a huge, thick piece of salmon with absolutely fantastic flavor. 

Graham had one of their specials, a Santa Fe style pasta. It had shrimp, chorizo and scallops in a chardonnay cream sauce. This was exceptional. Chain restaurants usually have tiny, sad little scallops. These were huge, and perfectly cooked. I'm a sucker for the dish I ordered, but this was as good as mine.

Everything I've ever had here is very good, the service is always good and I've always had a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Yum!! Some great food here!! Service was great and the food was really good!! Our cuts of meat were cooked to perfection!! Staff was quick and friendly. We would come back anytime and would highly recommend this place if u want a great steak at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"It's a bit disappointing when a restaurant (or a person, or a job, or a movie, for that matter) doesn't live up to its potential. This Firebirds has a lot going for them: decent sized menu, great location in SouthPark, pretty outdoor patio and nice, attentive service. But even with all of these seemingly nice features, the main component - the food - falls short. 

I enjoyed a lunch on the patio and while it's lovely, there isn't much of a view. Maybe I'm just too short, but all I saw were shrubs in my face. I ordered the fish tacos made with Mahi Mahi, served with roasted almond couscous. Sounded pretty damn tasty, and for $11 I went for it. 

While the couscous was generous in portion and toasted almond-y flavor, the fish tacos (the entire point of the meal) left a whole lot to be desired. For one, there were two tiny cubes of fish on each taco - I ate much more slaw than fish. But the main issue? The fish was incredibly salty...so salty I was downing my water and could hardly taste the flaky Mahi Mahi underneath. Sad fish. I ate the couscous instead. 

I think I'll head back to Firebirds for a cocktail at the bar...that seems to be more up my alley!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely in \"like\" with Firebirds...not in love. The service is great, the Northlake location is easy to get to with plenty of parking (and valet, if you so choose). 

Inside, the restaurant is full of big booths, a decent sized bar and plenty of seating options. While meeting a group of ladies for lunch, I went with the strawberry and grilled shrimp salad - a tasty mix of fresh greens, grilled shrimp, strawberry slices, jicama, candied nuts and a hefty helping of crumbled goat cheese. It was a very delicious choice, especially with the balsamic on the side!

Prices are agreeable for standard, sit down lunch fare. With a fairly diverse menu and solid service, this Firebirds is a solid choice for a Northlake meal."}
{"text":"Super pricy but super worth it. 

Came here at lunch time, so it was not as pricy as I thought. I got a seared salmon thing and a salad with grilles salmon. They were delicious. I saw some others get steaks... so next time I come back, it is steak time for me."}
{"text":"Ate here for be very first time recently and wish I would have known about this place sooner! The lobster dip with chips and bacon wrapped filet minion was a savory meal, one of the best filets I've had in awhile! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time for a holiday party and we had a great time. They had very friendly staff that were very attentive with our large group. They have awesome steaks and the calimari was amazing. The double black diamond martini is the best!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. The Double Black Diamond Martini is one of th best drinks. Their vodka is infused with pineapples for days so it has such an aging unique flavor. They have amazing bread to start off with so come hungry! My favorite dish would be the chicken with the pineapple salsa! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and was a little disappointed. I called and even spoke to a manager to make a reservation for a large party of about 20 . made the reservation a while before the event . when I made it nothing else was asked of me other then my name and amount and time I had asked about their prime rib since I had read it was good and this was my whole reason for chosing this place they raved about it and mentioned nothing else. The day of the event I was approached by a different manager as we waited for our seat . he asked some small talk type of questions but then asked something that had me a bit confused, he asked if we had done or requested a particular menu. This had me worried and I knew something was gonna be up since no onenhad mentioned that to me. We got sat down and most of it was lovely the bread was good . they had two waitresses that took care of us that did a good job . but no one mentioned anything about menu items. Our reservation was a bit later but still several hours before they close. When it came time to order meals I ordered the prime rib I had been waiting for . only to find out they had ran out . at least 5 others in my party were also trying to order the prime rib and this was very upsetting that even when I was making a reservation and specifically asking about the prime rib did no one mention to me it was limited per day and would be out long before we arrived . or that there was an option to request a specific menu so maybe they could hold some for us ? Not sure how that would have worked cud no one explained it to me . but this experience which other wise should have been fine was ruined by this. The steak I did have was alright . not amazing but not what I had been craving for a month. The service its self was good for the large party we had the wait staff took care of us well. You do wait a little longer for things but its to be expected for a place like this. Just kinda put a bad taste I'm my mouth and could have been handled much better."}
{"text":"Place is awesome!  Tier 1 food.  Staff is great.  Megan was an amazing waitress.  Fast, funny, great smile and good recommendations.  Terrific ambience.  A little pricey so bring your wallets gentlemen.  It will be a good night."}
{"text":"Our group of six sat out on the patio on this beautiful fall evening. We used the valet service because parking can be tough. 
We were seated right away  Service was fast with our drinks and the kids got covered plastic cups    Server was nice and seemed to know the menu
Plenty of selections on the menu 
My mom went for the meatloaf. She said it was good, a little dry,so she asked for more gravy
The salad with steak was cooked just right and big  bowl of greens  Salmon was good, cooked just right. The prime rib was good but not memorable. It comes with only one side , expensive for only one side
Margaritas cost $10.00, no happy hour prices here!
Our server made the experience very pleasant but the food was too mediocre for any more stars. 
This is not on my top ten or twenty but the patio is nice"}
{"text":"My family and I had a great dining experience on Friday night from the moment we walked in until the time we left. Moments after we were seated, our server Hailey came to the table and took our drink order. We skipped appetizers and opted for salads instead. The BLT salad was delicious. It was fresh, crisp and flavorful just like a wedge salad. I ordered surf and turf and it was cooked to perfection. It came with a bacon wrapped filet, 1/2 pound lobster tail, and loaded baked potato. I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor. My wife had the 12 oz prime rib, which came with au jus and horseradish sauce. She thought it was very tasty and had a baked potato with side toppings. My kids had the coconut shrimp and baby back ribs and were more than satisfied. The desserts were fabulous as well - creme brûlée cheesecake, flourless chocolate cake, Big Daddy chocolate cake, and Key Lime pie. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for the menu choices. I would also like to mention that their service was par to none. We haven't experienced this level of excellence in food service since we moved to Charlotte 10 months ago. The manager, Ian, came by to chat and we told him how pleased we were. We can't wait until our next visit!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and thought that it looks like a nice place.  So I googled the menu and it looked fabulous, so I thought I'd give it a try. Traveling alone on business can be uncomfortable but I was greeted nicely and I sat at the bar and the bartenders were fabulous and it's reasonably priced and the food was amazing, and it had great energy I will definitely go back.  It's really seemed like the employees enjoyed each other and there was no tension and a good flow, overall just a great experience.  Happy hour was priced amazingly and it was packed at 4:30 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Our experience here was absolutely fantastic! Our server was Leah and she was exceptional as well. She was very timely and handles things with great patience and kindness. One of our meals was slightly not what we were expecting and they replaced it with something different free of charge. They went above and beyond with their service! I'd recommended this to anyone and especially if you have a large group."}
{"text":"I was in Glendale for work from Seattle and I have to say, this was the best restaurant/Bar I visited while in town. I will definitely be back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Since Sarah left this place has gone down hill. I thought they could recover; but when Sam left it was disaster. The food was cold and the fish smelt bad, service sucks and they only had 6 martini glasses for the entire restaurant. However, Jenny saved the night! She could sense our concerns and like a true soldier took care of us."}
{"text":"Had the Honey Jack BBQ burger and it was delicious. The guy who served us had about as much energy as a dead man but hey the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.  Food was really good.  I had chile rubbed delmonico steak and husband had new york strip.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Mine was so tender...practically fell apart.  The warm chocolate brownie for dessert was insane.  Warm salted caramel sauce....need I say more?  Our waiter was Tom.  He was great....a perfect waiter."}
{"text":"Had a great meal and friendly prompt service. Prices were in par with my meal. As a matter of fact it would have cost me the same amount or more to cook it at home without the smoked flavor"}
{"text":"Did I get sick here? No.
Was the food knarly? No.
Did the waitress dis Coke products ? (How uncouth!) Yes
Was I charged for food we didn't order? Yes.

Will I ever come back to Firebirds? No."}
{"text":"Great environment. Service was fantastic. Very considerate. They didn't come and ask us every 3 min how we were doing. Food was cooked perfect. Portions were above average also. Not to pricey but you get what you pay for. So I think it was well worth it. Kids were satisfied with their meals."}
{"text":"I would love to give more stars but the expectation was much higher when I walked in. The food and cocktails is not that great. Service was not really good. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Had a reservation and we got there a little early, even though it was packed we got a seat at the bar, ordered drinks and were seated at our table shortly after earlier than our reservation! Our appetizer was awesome! We got crab cakes and it was fabulous. 
Our server was awesome. Very attentive and nice. 
My husband ordered surf and turf and I had the salmon. My food was good. I could tell the veg was frozen. But my fish was good. My husband... his steak wasn't medium rare it was raw. He sent it back and when it came back it was half cooked. And the lobster is frozen so his lobster was very rubbery and over cooked like they tried to cook the frozen out of it. A bonus is that our server was so attentive she got the steak recooked(not successful) and the manager did apologize and confirm the lobster is frozen. They were very apologetic and did assist with cost for an uncooked meal. I have to say the food wasn't great but from other reviews undercooked steak is kinda a pattern. But the service there was amazing."}
{"text":"Solid Peoria option, good menu selections for this steak-and-seafood restaurant that is walking distance from the Peoria Sports Complex and Mariners/Padres spring training games. We were looking for a restaurant within the Arrowhead complex that was still open, found Firebirds, and their staff could not have been more hospitable despite our arrival just 30 minutes prior to their 11PM closing. Our server, Kenneth, was really good, just the right amount of being interactive and informative while adding a really good personality. We enjoyed our main courses, both seafood options (grilled salmon and a terriyaki salmon dish), and they were cooked perfectly with tasty vegetables and well-presented. Despite our timing, they made it a very positive experience for us. Extensive wine list, lots of parking surrounding the business. Will definitely return again, although next time we will make sure that we have a little more time on the clock!"}
{"text":"First time visit. It was a toss up between here and the Elephant Bar next door and at least on the Internet the menu looked way more appetizing from the Firebird. 

Monday at 5pm so no wait. Menu is pretty simple but classy. You can still get anything from a salad or burger to a nice slab of prime rib or lobster tail. The decor was warm and inviting with high ceilings brown tones of a hillside hunting lodge; down to the 6x6 bull elk mounted on the wall. 

Jen ordered a salad and I added the quesadilla and onion rings for appetizers. I am a huge fan of battered apps not breaded. The onion rings here are battered but very lightly then coated with some panko breading. New to me as I am set in my beer battered ways, but very very good. The quesadilla was decent but since I am not a fan of mushy black beans which in this case were an ingredient, I wasn't in awe but figured it want horrible. Another positive is they have the really good creamy ranch not the knock off crap. 

Next up was the prime rib. I was really torn from what I wanted going back and forth amongst the lobster and bacon wrapped filet, the prime rib, or a plain ribeye. They have literally, an actual wood fire grill which I love and almost mandates you order at least something from the grill. 

Both mine and Jen's prime rib was cooked perfectly and oh so tender. She was mostly full already so barely touched her green beans but agreed the prime was delish! My side was seasoned steak fries which were as awesome as we all hope they will be when we order them. 

The highlight was our server Pedro. Perfect timing, very polite, non-intrusive, and silent service when applicable. I preached silent service for twenty years to my staff advising you don't need to interrupt the guests constantly. Its priceless and oblivious to most servers and guests. Loved this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars due to the food experienced my wife had... She ate the chicken pasta and it was not that good. I had the 14oz rib eye it was good. However I don't like the fact that it's an a la carte type of place. They only offer a baked potato with the steak and it wasn't even loaded. Needed more sour cream. Each additional side is 5 bucks for a small amount of food. Aside from that my dish was great. I also ordered a caesar salad and it was BOMB!! The steak was very juicy!!"}
{"text":"All around: excellent. We made a reservation, the customer service was on top of things, friendly, fast, and efficient. The ambiance is nice, played nice music, not too nice where it's not comfortable. But the food! Oh my gosh. Down to the bread; everything was excellent. I got the center sirloin- amazing. But if you get the sirloin as well, make sure you get a side of mushrooms. The combination in your mouth is magical. The loaded baked potato was good. Caesar - good. Everything. Good."}
{"text":"Really enjoy eating here every time ive been. Cant say that ive got a bad meal from here. I get the filet more times then not and love that they have newcastle on draft. One of two great joints in the northlake area"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the ratings, prices, and happy hour menu. Should've read some of the reviews to save us the headache. For the breakdown:

Misters in the patio keep you cool during the Arizona summer. The 360 misters in the middle should be re-thought out as they create puddles of water in the center of the patio and the puddles attract mosquitos.

I called in 20 mins ahead to see if they allowed dogs in their outdoor patio and if they had room available. The host answered promptly and accurately and seated us as soon as we came in. The waiter was attentive and made sure to correct any issues we had. Manager was also a pleasure to deal with. (More on that later)

I ordered a Tennessee Summer, which came out watered down. My boyfriend had the signature Double Black Diamond Martini, which I ended up drinking since it was too sweet for him but palatable in comparison to my drink.The bread and salad get 5 stars. Boy, do they try to get you with that complimentary bread! You know...sometimes we base a place off their apps and Firebird's bread will surely have you fooled. Definitely thought that the rest of my meal would be amazing after trying their bread. NOT 

We ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and beef sliders off of their happy hour menu, as well as a wood grilled sirloin steak with a loaded bake potato. I had half a grilled shrimp taco and my boyfriend ate the rest of them, we agreed they were subpar. Although they were overcooked, I liked the concept of the sliders served only with mustard. They reminded me of my favorite homemade grilled cheese that uses the same key ingredients: cheese, onions, and mustard. 

Out comes the sirloin with the extra salted loaded baked potato. Had to scoop the butter out of the potato and brush off some of the salt and after that it was quite tasty. Made the mistake of ordering my sirloin Medium knowing very well that the steak continues to cook as it sits on the plate and sure enough it came out close to well done. I took the blame on that one, but wasn't accepting any excuse for the disgusting taste of that steak. You could immediately tell that the steak had been cooked on a surface that just had salmon on it, almost as if it was cooked in the fish's oil itself. Needless to say, I thought about feeding the rest of it to my dog but I wouldn't even give him what tasted like tainted meat. I brought this to the attention of the waiter who sent his manager over and they kindly said took care of it and asked if I would like another plate. 

Kitchen needs to put a more Love into their food."}
{"text":"An absolute gem nestled outside of Charlotte. I had the Prime Rib medium rare and it was perfectly cooked. Most tend to overlook medium rare out of fear I suppose. The atmosphere was lively and surprisingly packed at 6 PM on a Tuesday. Definitely get a reservation. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night with some family. Made online reservations and while finding a parking spot was an excursion, we were quickly seated. The place is gorgeous both inside and out. The waitresses were all super friendly. 

We got the lobster spinach dip as an appetizer...amazing! I got the Durango burger. It was cooked just how I asked and was delicious. One family member got a steak that was fantastic and the other got the Parmesan crusted flounder and an extra crab cake. I tried the crab cake and was amazed at how good it was. The flounder was also amazing, light, full of flavor and moist. Nothing about this meal was disappointing!

The only downside other than the parking was the cocktail menu. A little high and not what I would call a great selection. However, I'm sure that anything from the bar would have been great as the bar was visibly stocked with everything under the sun.

I will DEFINETLY be going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The atmosphere is incredible, service is great and food is well price and excellent. I always get the aspen sirloin with sweet potato fries. It's my favorite. Also, their kind of wedge salad is very good, not to mention the warm bread they bring to your table as soon as you sit down. 

It kind be crowded. Make sure you make reservations or call ahead, if not your waiting time can be up to 2 hours. I always go to the one located in Stonecrest. 

Their cocktails are out of this world as well."}
{"text":"Here's something weird.

I love Firebirds.  The food is usually very good, and the prices are not ridiculous.  You can get a great steak without paying DelFrisco's prices.  
Last night, my girlfriend and I dined at this Firebirds.  We had the lobster queso, split a BLT salad, and I had the bleu cheese filet, while she had the chicken pasta.  
Everything was spectacular.  Bottom line.  However, a couple hours after eating there, she started feeling nauseous.  About an hour after that, I started feeling the same way.
Her suffering was much worse than mine, but something we ate simply didn't agree with either of us.  I'm blaming the lobster queso, simply because it's incredibly rich, full of cream, and we both ate a lot.  Plus, besides the bread and salad, it's the only thing we shared.  
Another thing I should mention is that we both had a double black-diamond martini; these are absolutely heavenly.  I sure hope they didn't have anything to do with the GI distress, as I'll certainly have more in the future.
I'm treating the stomach thing as a fluke, as this is my 5th or 6th trip to Firebird's, and I've never had a problem before.  I'll add another star after my next pain-free visit.  :)"}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews, I should have been excited to go here. We went for a family birthday dinner, and it started out looking promising. I had been told that it was on the level of the Keg, which I love. But then I got a laminated menu like I was at a diner, and my opinion started to change. Their menu was quite limited - for example: I think there were only 2 \"side\" items that weren't potato. But despite the small variety of choices, I chose a rib-eye steak, which I love, even at lower priced venues such as Texas Roadhouse. I also got a salad to start. My husband ordered the steak Delmonico and a salad to start. My father in law and brother in law ordered the same dish, a medium Filet. 

Three of us ordered salads, and even though they had good flavor, they were completely overdressed. My salad which was just a mixed green salad was chopped in such a way that it was very very difficult to eat. It wasn't large enough to stab with my fork, or scoop up either. 

There were seven of us at the table, and when our food did come out, they had a lot of difficulty figuring out who got what dish. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but it did kind of kill the mood as far as \"here's your food, let's eat!\" The other confusion came from the fact that my husband and I had the exact same cut of meat - both medium well rib-eyes. Despite the fact that I had ordered Medium rare, and he had ordered a medium rare Delmonico. (and yes, I know that there is differences in thought about what that is, but it should have not been the same cut as mine) My father in law had a nicely medium filet, but my brother in law's was medium rare. So out of 4 steaks, they only cooked one correctly. At a steak house, I would NOT expect 75% of the steak to be the incorrect temp!

Not everyone was disappointed. My mother-in-law liked her salmon (after she was told that they didn't have her first fish of choice), and my sister in law enjoyed her trout.  And of course my father in law enjoyed his correctly cooked steak. 

None of us sent our food back, as it was edible, but I know that after this experience, I will not be back. This place was too high priced to be this disappointing. There are many other restaurants within walking distance that are much much better, and personally, I would much rather have a cheap steak at Texas Roadhouse where I can have a large variety of choices for sides, as I know that it will be the correct temp. If I'm looking for something high priced and delicious, it will be the Keg or Flemings - definitely not here."}
{"text":"Had our 2nd good meal there. Staff and food is great. We have had Angela and Diamond so far and both were great."}
{"text":"Found this place while at the mall trying to eat up time (no pun intended) waiting to check into a hotel nearby. Left Charleston this a.m. due to Hurricane Matthew and found myself in Huntersville, NC. Anyhoo...new town for me....new restaurant for me. I ordered the WOOD GRILLED SALMON*
Basted with Key lime butter, served with parmesan mashed potatoes, fresh vegetables. And the vegetables which consisted of broccoli, squash & red pepper were oh so fresh!! I cleaned my plate & it wasn't because I haven't had a real meal in a couple days. Well maybe that played a part...but the salmon, mashed potatoes & veggies were seasoned well & just delicious. My server Kendelyo was very pleasant as well."}
{"text":"We went there last night with a friend that was visiting for business in from California. Wonderful atmosphere, our server Theresa was excellent. So personable and friendly. The food was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the restaurant Week special which included an appetizer of wonderful hummus, prime rib with Parmesan mashed potatoes, and then we were so busy talking after I take pictures except for dessert which was a brownie with ice cream. Which was literally to die for."}
{"text":"highly recommend the chicken wings - they are grilled and have an awesome flavor.  Also the BLT salad is wonderful.  Don't miss the Black Diamond Martini - pineapple martini's to die for."}
{"text":"We go here all the time - it is one of our Phoenix Favs - I love the chicken wings - they are smoked - very good.  I also love the BLT salad.  Steaks are all good. The Firebirds Chicken Pasta is AWESOME! Service is always good, atmosphere is really nice and cozy. GO"}
{"text":"Great place. The steak was FANTASTIC. Cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and tasted delicious! The wood fired grill taste really comes through. The staff was hip and very friendly."}
{"text":"Love eating here. Great food and service. Be sure you make reservations for evening dining at the Stonecrest location.  Very poplar restaurant. We have never been disappointed. Parking can be a problem at times although they do offer Valet parking."}
{"text":"Drinks were strong and amazing tasting, the wait staff was super educated on menu and helpful, he was personable and great, I had 3 apps , not single handed lol I had help. Coco shrimp, deviled eggs, and tuna , all of which had great sauces and full of great flavor, I went with surf and turf, everyone enjoyed their meal, they made a great time even better"}
{"text":"It's not often I'm in the mood for a steak. Having an ovo-icthy-lacto-vegetarian wife will do that for you. But even she found something to enjoy here.

I had the chili-rubbed steak and the side of southwestern scalloped potatoes. The steak was excellent, prepared as requested. Loads of flavor. Just the right amount of marbling. Oh, and it was huge. As in... huge. Did not leave hungry. And I don't think I had but a single slice of the bread beforehand.

My wife had the seared ahi appetizer and a baked potato. Yes, an odd combo to be sure. But she enjoyed it completely. Didn't even give me a bite.

The service was excellent, going so far as allowing my wife to sample a wine. It wasn't to her liking -- was mine, but I wasn't in the mood -- and our server didn't even bat an eye when she opted for a glass of iced tea. 

A solid rating. I saw many other tasty items on the menu and look forward to my return!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Firebirds! I had a blueberry twin tequila margarita it was delicious!! I ate a BLT salad & had the filet & lobster tail with Parmesan mashed potatoes.. it was very good , too stuffed to try desert! It was a nice new place to go ... ! Will be back to enjoy soon."}
{"text":"I have worked in restaurants for more years than I care to admit.  I have worked casual to upscale and everywhere in between.  I know good food and I know good service.  Firebirds never ceases to amaze me.  The steaks (particularly for the pricepoint) are expertly prepared and the sides are on point.  Wine and spirit selection will please any pallette.  As for the service, I am always impressed.  We've been a few times and most times have been greeted by a manager at some point during the meal to inquire as to our satisfaction. In other cases I found the servers to be engaging and friendly without being annoying.  I've been to both the Southpark and Stonecrest locations and the consistency is precise.  You really can't ask for much more from a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good variety of dishes and can accommodate diverse palates. We came for dinner and tried the crab cakes. Decent amount of crab meat and the mango chutney sauce was good - but why tortilla slaw (just soggy tortilla chips)? I ordered the grilled shrimp and strawberry salad. Too bad the shrimp was overdone and was a little too chewy for restaurant standards. The combination of goat cheese and strawberries and spiced pecans can not be beat. The quantity was great - I could barely finish. I also tried the chicken pasta, which came in a ginormous portion as well. It was tasty. I think people really just come here for the somewhat upscale casual atmosphere - the food is okay but not exceptional. Service is standard."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Firebirds and see locations all over Charlotte, NC. Can't say I was overly impressed with the food/drink selection but the service was great and very friendly in Northlake."}
{"text":"Overall, Firebirds (Peoria) is a pretty good place, but there are some downsides.  The wife and I had been there 4 times, and now it's finally time for quick and simple review! :-)

THE HITS:
+ A bar area is available to wait before being seated
+ The bar area has relatively quick servers and bartenders
+ The bar area has fairly ample seating--you're bound to find a place to chill, even if it's by someone else (socialize...it won't hurt!)
+ Happy hour specials are good
+ Most entrées are tasty with good size portions, e.g. big cuts of steak
+ Once prime-time-dinner-time passes, the place can clear out pretty quickly
+ Coupons and discounts available, e.g. scratch-offs and birthday coupons
+ Big dining area
+ Casual (or dress-up) dining/drinks with an overall good atmosphere

THE MISSES:
- The place can get busy, even on a Monday night, so that results in a wait
- \"Incomplete plates\", e.g. only two items with a steak dinner--the steak and one side.  Though the steaks are big (12-16oz), it seems that an additional side, like a vegetable, should be included as well, especially for $23-$30.
- So prices a little on the high side of the \"$$\" rating.
- Exposed kitchen so ambient noise can get loud, e.g. clanking dishes, pans, etc.
- Steaks and beef cuts are good but not great, e.g. the prime rib can be grizzly, and the New York Strip can have tough marbling

If I can think of more to add to the list, I will update my review.  Basically, if the steaks were of higher quality and an additional side would be included, or the prices reduced bringing more value to the table, then I'd give Firebirds another star.  For now, it's going to hang out at 3."}
{"text":"Firebirds is very good!  This is probably the nicest restaurant in the Northlake area.  I've eaten their filet mignon and the burger from there.  The staff is always very friendly and professional.  You also get bread before your meal there which is a super bonus for me.  I love bread!  They also ask if you want more bread if you finish it before your meal comes out, which I love to get more bread!  The food is very high quality and fresh here.  The cocktails are very good, I had the margarita and loved it.  The drinks however are a little bit pricy but that pretty standard at a nice restaurant.  The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is that two of the times that I have been to Firebirds, my order has been wrong.  Nothing huge but small stuff like the wrong side item, and cheese on my burger when I ordered no cheese."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. 
Our server was Abdullah, very pleasant.
Started with the Arnold Palmers to drink. It was so sweet we had to ask for water to dilute it. Our waiter was very accommodating with that.
Appetizer wings were just average. The dipping sauce tasted like a ranch/ blue cheese mix & was extremely salty! 
My daughter ordered the Durango Burger, beautiful presentation & over all a good burger. It was a fair size that she couldn't finish. However, pretty pricey at $13.50
I had the Peppercorn Steak. $ $23.95. I was somewhat surprised that it came \"pre sliced\" in strips not as a whole steak?! The Peppercorn Sauce was ok needed a bit more salt & more of the sauce on the plate. I had to ask for a side of steak sauce. You'll have the option of a side excluding soup or salad, that is an addition cost. My first thought; was to go with the Parmesan Mashed Potatoes but asked the server about the Au Gratin & which he preferred. So, Au Gratin it was! Disappointed they were overcooked. It's offered up in a small ceramic dish separate from the steak. All the cheese had melted off & just the over broiled bubble residue coated the sides. It was oily & lacked in flavor.
I will say the customer server was good. We were visited by the manger who came over & greeted us and was engaging. Our server was professional, but the overall experience wasn't impressive for the experience & price."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my lunch. I didn't realize that my salad came with the dressing already on it...and they drenched it in a ranch that had no flavor. I was very nice about it when sending it back saying, um so sorry..but I didn't realize the dressing wasn't on the side...he comes back 5 min later..with the dressing mixed in again...ugh..I didn't want to be THAT customer to send it back again, so I just ate the mediocre bland chicken tenders and left the rest. My husband loved his burger but I didn't enjoy my lunch whatsoever. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to Firebirds for a company dinner and they had no problem taking care of such a large group. Service was quick, orders were all perfectly correct. I had salmon which was perfectly cooked. The crab cake appetizer was fabulous. Happy hour really was great, half priced drinks and appetizers. The cherry limeade alcoholic beverage was delicious!"}
{"text":"The prime rib was 5 stars. YUM. (Note: I'm easy to please and also like Outback Prime Rib). Apologies for comparing it to Outback, it's definitely more upscale and with mostly higher quality ingredients.

Spinach lobster queso dip is just one of those things you can't mess up. I've had few places botch this one up, definitely something I would get again if I'm looking to fatten up a bit. The wings were ordinary.

The shrimp skewer (add $5) and lobster tail were tough; eating them is like gnawing on rock salt. Totally not worth the extra money, but it's all good because it was sponsored by my company (YEAUHHH BOIII). 0 stars for this one.

The creme brulee cheesecake was like crack - a huge portion of awesomely rich and creamy  cheesecake, topped with a thin layer of crystallized sugar. Could not stop gorging myself on this. If you like Key Lime Pie, you would love the one here, creamy and tangy, also served in generous portions. The brownie a la mode was decent, just stay away from the chocolate cake (dry and just bleh!).

Overall, great service, (mostly) great food... don't forget to try their pineapple cocktail! Points deducted for the horrendous wait for a table and that they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 8."}
{"text":"Always good food. You get a lot of food for the money and great building next to movie theaters and desserts"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years, but was in the neighborhood and a few of us wanted to grab something to eat.  It was an awkward time - 4PM.  You're either that young, cool professional who was too busy to grab lunch and grabbing it now, or that 83-year old man having dinner at his regular time.  Okaaaay, so moving on...

Service - We had a good server that was nice and attentive and answered our questions.  The only thing that was kind of weird was that he'd get up in your grill.  When he asked me what I'd like, I looked down at the menu, and when I looked up, dude was like 6 inches from my face.  Felt like it was Les Phoenix in France or something where personal space is tight.  Other than that, really solid.  

Food - Get the chile mac'n'cheese, and you won't regret it.  Pasta was cooked just right, and the hint of chile gives it a little heat.  Coconut shrimp starter is pretty big for six shrimps so I'd prob not order the main of it.  Prime rib was just okay, but it's more of an excuse to dip my meat in things... like pho-king, the restaurant where they serve vietnamese food.  #nicesave

I'd come by again at 4PM.

dmo out."}
{"text":"Never heard of Firebirds until last night. We had a company team dinner here and I'm always game for a free meal. So what the heck. 

Walked in and there's a small hostess stand with the bar just in sight which makes it very inviting. The dining room reminds me of lodge with a big deer head hanging on the wall staring at you. The place was packed on a Tuesday night and loud. People just talking and having a good time. Didn't see lots of kids so I would say it one of those adult type restaurants. 

Anyways, I had the prime rib. They only serve 12 or 16 oz. Thick piece a meat that was cooked really good. Let's say perfectly cooked with very little fat. Just how I like it. So tender and juicy. Really good prime rib. It came with a fully load baked potato. It had butter, cheese, bacon, green onions and I had mine without sour cream. Baked potato was really good except I'm one of those guys that eat the whole potato including the skin. They put a ton of salt on the skin so if you don't brush off some of that salt then it can be a little too much. This was a really good dinner with a big portion. 

We had 11 people in our dinner party and they were pretty good in welcoming us, getting us our drinks and refilling our drinks. Took awhile for them to take our order, bring us our food, and bringing the check. Little slow but I think that was okay because Firebirds is a place to relax and have a good conversation at your table. 

Now I know about Firebirds and they have a nice menu beside steak which includes fish, pasta, sandwiches, and salads. Good variety. I'll probably be back to bring my family. Enjoy and Cheers."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my husband. It's got a nice atmosphere and a good place when we want something close. Casual dinning with better food that most chains. It can be a bit loud but we tend to go earlier in the evening so it's not as bad."}
{"text":"To sum up our dining adventure, my husband's comment as we left was \"Well, that was a totally forgettable experience\".    I had a glass of wine, and wanted another glass to go with the actual meal........the waitress never returned.   Even though I had an empty wine  and water glass and my husband's ice tea was empty.   Overall, the food was fine, but at the prices charged, one should not have to be looking around, hoping to spot their waitress in order to get a beverage refill.    

I ordered the bleu cheese filet and it was delicious.   My husband ordered the Delmonico steak, cooked medium well.   It was definitely done WELL, no pink in sight.   He ate it anyway, since no one checked on how it was and he was hungry.

Would go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Victoria our waitress was fantastic. Never needed wanted or waited for anything. Steak was a little over cooked. Also got a half rack of ribs and hoped they would be off the charts but not so much. Wife's Parmesan Crusted Mahi Mahi  was cooked perfectly and was an excellent choice. Will come back and order something different next time"}
{"text":"Came with parents on the last sunday I spent with them in Arizona. 

Pluses:
- Spacious parking lot
- Fast seating and Courteous staff. seriously, all of them were so friendly and definitely worked to keep their customers happy.
- Food is amazing and comes in generous portions (always the best)! They are really generous about specific requests you have with your order. 
- meats are cooked just right. you know when you ask medium rare for something but they cook it medium or medium well?? yeah, none of that!
- They congratulate birthdays/anniversaries with a free desert/candle. it's sooo cute and sooo good. We got a huge slice of cheesecake. By this time our stomachs were literally about to explode.

Why it's not a 5?
- They have an open kitchen and although it's not that big of a deal (since you get to see what foods they serve for future reference), im just not a big fan of it
- Lighting is too dim for me. Yeah, it sets the mood but it doesn't have to be thaaat dark"}
{"text":"Sort of like a poor mans version of Ruth Chris's steak house  or a rich mans version of Frasher's steak house.  Food was good but not great. Service was very good.  Plenty of wine choices but very limited beer menu. I find it a shame when you have a nice place that thinks that wine is cultured but beer is not."}
{"text":"I must upgrade the review based on excellent customer service follow-up by both Leslie M., the Business Customer Service Rep, and by Michael Wolf, the Regional Manager...within hours of my review!  Wolf also offered an apology, willingness to improve by providing feedback back to the restaurant, and even offered to send me a generous gift card to any of the Firebirds' locations.  Am most definitely impressed with their first-rate customer service!"}
{"text":"Great value and accommodating to big families. Needless to say the food and service very good."}
{"text":"Thursday evening isn't a day you would consider to be a busy evening for a restaurant so I was surprised when our party of 3 were told there's a 20 minute wait or sit at the bar. We took the bar option.

Our waitress was friendly but kept disappearing. Our food which was basically 2 sets of three sliders, fish tacos and pretzels took 35 minutes to arrive and this was just appetizer food.

The food was ok. Nothing great. I wouldn't expect much from app food to be honest so I can't knock them for that.

It seemed everyone's food was slow and that everyone had complaints."}
{"text":"Crazy almost all the time. . .but staff consistently friendly.  One of the most popular places with the Ballantyne set for salad lunch and steak dinners.  Wood fired.  

LAST TIME WE WENT THEY DID OFFER \"CALL AHEAD\" SEATING, which saved a LOT of time.  

Food is standard fare mid-range \"steakhouse\" with loaded baked potato, house-made yeasty bread loaf with crazy-big Australian Steakhouse style knives.  Good selection of steak rubs.  The coconut shrimp app makes for a satisfying dinner.  Ribs nice too.    

Bar area is almost always jammed.  Wine selection is ok; could be better could be worse.  The price mark-up for champagne obscene, but they carry veuve-clicquot. . .so what can you say?  Lots of martini drinkers.  

Managerial staff goes out of their way to be friendly.  Friday and Saturday nights are exceptionally busy; but, it's a fun people watching location, with a lively clientele where everyone seems to be having a good time talking, laughing and catching up with one another."}
{"text":"Firebirds is a SOLID lunch/dinner option in Ballantyne. They're always able to provide great service, food is seemingly fresh and portions are plentiful. Our toddler is always excited to go as they provide 2-packs of Oreos with every kids meal. I absolutely adore the Firebird spinach salad with Chicken! (YUM)! It's not an inexpensive option but dependable for sure and it's refreshing to go to a place where they truly take service seriously. I have NO complaints!"}
{"text":"Better than the Firebirds I went to in Charlotte.  The tortilla soup is pretty flavorful.  Not sure why the ribeye was 1/4 inch thick.  Ribeyes should be at least 3/4 inch thick.  Might have something to do with using a wood fired grill instead of a broiler, but still a bit odd.  Very tasty steak.  My wife loved the brownie dessert with the special sauce."}
{"text":"I just wasn't feeling it here.  The steak was ok, although the bleu cheese sauce was very nice.  The sides were uninspired.

The service, as is usual in this area, was very good."}
{"text":"Local favorite. Mid scale pricing with incredible food. Just fancy enough for a nice date night without really breaking the bank. Great for a double date, holiday, birthday, Valentine's, bringing someone there who's not from town. It's got a little for everyone. Perfect for anyone!"}
{"text":"The bread is really good.

The food is not bad, but a bit overpriced vs portion size. I love their salads.

The service is just plain awful. I have no idea why I bothered coming back to this place, thinking the service would get any better, it never does. I've been here like 5-6 times with different people at different times. The service has always been terrible every time. 

Why do I always end up with Food Servers with an \"I don't want to be here\" attitude (maybe it's a crappy company to work for?) who keep you waiting to take your order, never clear away the dirty plates, never refill your beverages, and disappear when you need to pay for your check? I get better service at a buffet!

I think I'm done coming here."}
{"text":"I ate here recently on a trip to visit family in Charlotte.  I was very pleased with my meal.  I ordered the salmon and had fries and a veggie (can't remember which one) for my sides.  The salmon was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I'm in town on business I eat here... Almost always the colorado chicken salad... Sometimes ADD sirloin!! And usually buy another salad to go for lunch at work. HH is decent, too. MGMT ALERT--- great that Keith is a Jets fan, but insulting the customers because he saw their team logo on something just doesn't work. After 3 separate comments about what he Would've done to my food if he'd have known my team, I asked if I should send my food back. His reply? \"I didn't do anything to it cuz I didn't know before I handed it to you!\" 
I'M SORRY, WHAT???"}
{"text":"The first thing that I noticed as I walked in, was the smell.  It was a gloriously wonderful smell, similar to liquid smoke.  The atmosphere was dim and rustic, yet elegant.  I could tell that I was in for a treat. How right I was!

The free bread was amazing.  It's bread! Who would get excited about that?  I am shocked that bread could be this good.  It really makes me wonder what it was I have been eating with my PB and Js all these years.
For the entree, I had the 9oz filet and the Parmesan mashed potatoes.  From the moment the filet hit my tongue, the flavor explosion that hit my mouth was intense.  Hands down, the best steak I have ever eaten - even better than those in the Midwest.  It was cooked perfectly, had an amazing crust, and simply melted in my mouth.

I had the brownie with the salted caramel sauce.  While this was good, I feel the salted caramel could have been a little more flavorful.

I am surprised that I haven't gone there sooner.  This is definitely my new \"go-to\" restaurant for all special occasions."}
{"text":"We usually eat here twice a year - for birthdays - because dinner for two of us with drinks is like $80 (plus tip) and so it's kind of a special thing. We usually go around dinnertime, so yeah, it's crowded, but the most we've ever had to wait is like 20 minutes.

Our server this past week was Katie, and she was SUPER nice and very upbeat, and pretty much her attitude was what every person in the service industry should have. 

Steaks - delicious. But what rocks my socks are the Parmesan mashed potatoes. I could eat a BUCKET of those things. Ah. MAY. Zing. 

Ironically there's a LoneStar or something right next door which I'm sure is cheaper but seriously spend the extra cash and go here instead."}
{"text":"The martinis are always smooth and top notch. The blue cheese filet with mushrooms is so delicious, my entire family now orders that every time we go!"}
{"text":"My quick summary: Fabulous dining for any reason.

My fiance and I usually go here in the evenings for date nights.  But yesterday my 10 coworkers and I went her for a work lunch.  I was amazed at how smoothly the service went for 11 people.  Our waitress was fantastic and the food was amazing, as always.

Since I've dined here before I had to switch to a gluten free diet, I'll just go ahead and tell you about all the food, versus just what I ate yesterday.  They start you out with loaves of fresh baked bread and butter.  The crust is crispy, perfect, divine & I have no idea how they accomplish that.  I wish my baking experiments came out that well.  They were more than willing to bring out many, many loaves for the carb addicted hordes at our table.

The appetizers the table shared as a group were the lobster spinach dip, smoked chicken wings, and onion rings.  I, myself, have only tried the lobster spinach dip.  It is hands down the best I have ever had.  It has just the right about of lobster so that you actually can get a bit in every bite.  I did not get to try the onion rings or wings, but they looked amazing.  There was no excess oil or anything to make either appetizer looks slightly soggy.  Everyone raved about how wonderful & perfectly cooked everything was.  I got to sit in watch in extreme envy.  Woo boy.

For my entree I had the Aspen sirloin and loaded baked potato.  I ordered my steak medium rare, and shockingly, it was a true medium rare.  Most places overcook it and bring out a medium.  Not Firebird's.  And it was so juicy and delicious.  The baked potato was also amazing.  My only complaint was that they outside was pretty salty.  But, unlike most people, I am not a huge salt person.  I like spicier and/or other flavors, not so much salty ones.  So I chalk this up to my own personal taste.  It had bacon, chives, sour cream, cheese, all the goodies.

I also have to rave about their pecan crusted trout with peach salsa that I've has before.  I'm not usually a fish person, but I am a salsa person so it caught my eye.  And I ate every bite.  That fish & salsa is addictingly good.

The group ordered an array of dessert combos and there was no complaints from anyone.  They even brought one friend a small bowl of vanilla ice cream because she wasn't hungry enough to eat a real dessert, the wimp.

Best of all, the service was continuously prompt.  Our waitress checked on us every couple of minutes for drinks, etc.  And they delivered all our dishes within moment of each others, so no one was watching other people eat, etc.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"One of the things my wife and I are huge on is customer service.  Ever since we have been to this establishment, we have been treated like family.  The managers make us very comfortable and even have special dishes prepared for us when we come.  Waitstaff is always pleasant to work with and know us quite well.  

The best thing I have eaten there was the Delmonico steak and the grilled flounder (not on the menu, but it should be).  But even if you don't get a custom dish, their regular fare does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The food is okay but it's probably frozen. It's a nicer version of outback. Atmosphere is decent. The bar area looks like it has locals that hang out on weekends."}
{"text":"Now with TATOR TOTS!!!

Here's some misc tips:

Ask for bread soonest. And, I'm pretty sure crab cake salad is new to the menu, regardless of what people say. Also, call-ahead seating, especially for lunch. And, all the bar half-booths are open seating."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Firebirds Wood Fired Grill for the first time. Unfortunately, I was greeted with a somewhat horrifying experience. First, my party and I went to this restaurant for Happy Hour and was told that there was not enough room for us to indulge in the Happy Hour festivities as only those sitting in the bar and patio area were privy and both aforementioned areas were full. We then managed to talk to the manager and sit at a regular booth and enjoy Happy Hour drinks and food. The first drink given to our table was supposed to be a Jack's Honey Peach Tea, but upon receiving the drink, it should have been called Pink Sludge. The drink was full of clumps of an unknown sticky substance. The waiter's two explanations was that it could have been either fruit pulp or egg whites in the cocktail. The drink's description did not mentioned fruit pulp or egg whites. So, with that being said, there has to be a problem with cleanliness. The food was mediocre at best. I will say the waiter was very charismatic and took care of my party and I. As a result of this experience I ended up with food poisoning and multiple trips to the toilet to throw up. I would not recommend Firebirds after this experience, unfortunately."}
{"text":"So far my favorite place to eat in Chandler. Great apps, the bread is very good, and everything I have had so far has been delicious. Large wine list, good drinks, and don't forget the dessert. Creme brûlée cheesecake is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to the Northlake location once and tonight I visited this location (Sharon Road). Both times, I have left thinking that I could have gotten better food elsewhere, especially for the cost. Tonight I ordered a kids meal for my niece, which was cold when it came out and the mac and cheese, in her words, \"did not taste like anything.\" She was content with her burger, though. I got the Parmesan Mahi which came out hot and delicious. I was very happy with my meal. For a tuesday, they were pretty busy. Our waitress seemed to have a lot going on. We were checked on a couple times and she did a decent job considering how busy she was. 

Overall, okay experience but will probably not visit again."}
{"text":"Had the mixed greens salad, signature coffee and portabello sandwich. Everything was fantastic. Salad was fresh. My company was happy with her salad, chicken dinner and mixed drink. Food was very promt. Minimal lag time the entire meal. Great experience. Only wish I loved closer so I could become a regular!"}
{"text":"We had happy hour in the bar recently and were pleased with the food and drink choices. Lots of good specials, you can make a huge meal out of a few dollars per plate. The waitress was super-nice and very attentive, really good service. The only thing I wasn't happy with were the loaded potato skins (they were bland) and she happily let me trade it out for something else.

Although attached to Northlake Mall, you access the restaurant from the outside with lots of easy parking at the mall. Great ambiance and decor, think classy wine country-esque eatery with stacked stone fireplaces, nice wood, gas lanterns, etc. Great for date night or a special occasion."}
{"text":"As usual, Firebirds didn't disappoint us on date night. This is a great place to go for a nice date night, not too casual, and won't break the bank either. We usually venture out to the location in StoneCrest, however, SouthPark is now closer and we will definitely be back!

The bread that comes out to the table is a serious crack addiction. I can't get enough!!!

I started my dinner off with their signature martini, The Double Black Diamond (fresh pineapple infused for 21 days with Svedka All Natural Citron Vodka and garnished with a sweet pineapple slice). If I could have, and I quite possibly might do this one night, I could have sat at the bar and ordered these all night along with the bread and been perfectly content. Such a delicious cocktail, well balanced, and smooth. 

For dinner, I opted for the parmesan encrusted Mahi with tomato basil buerre blanc and the sautéed mushrooms. The fish was cooked perfectly, the seasoning complimented the fish, and the mushrooms were so tasty. My husband had the rib-eye steak, mid-rare, with steak fries, and according to him, the steak was cooked to the perfect mid-rare, and was seasoned well. 

Our waitress was so sweet, and attentive (gosh I wish I could remember her name). The restaurant itself had a nice crowd, not too busy, and was clean and well-staffed for the amount of tables seated. 

We will be back for their wine nights to try that out, and the SouthPark location is now our new fav. 5 stars, job VERY well done! Thank you for starting out our date night right!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Wait staff (Ian) was very knowledgeable and helpful. Management (AJ) was very nice and a pleasure to talk too.  My wife's Filet Mignon was the best she has ever had, it melted in her mouth. We had Ranch Rings which were very good. My Kobe Beef Meatloaf and beans were very tasty. The garlic potatoes were a little dry for my taste and I did not like them. The chocolate cake delicious . We will be back. It was worth the trip from Rock Hill."}
{"text":"We don't come here often due to the prices.  However, with tonight being the last official day of summer for the kids (school starts tomorrow), my ten year old loves the mac n cheese and my sixteen year olds love of the baby backs, we thought we would treat them.  The service was great and the food for the most part was good.  I had the kabobs and the hubby had the rib eye.  Although I was super happy with mine, the rib eye was not so good.  Fortunately, they were both cooked medium, however the rib eye was really tough.  We eat rib eye all of the time as it is our first choice for steak.  This one seemed more like a sirloin.  Definitely not worth the $25 spent on it.  We usually really enjoy our meals here, not sure what went wrong this time."}
{"text":"I like this place. Good atmosphere overall. Don't sit close to the open kitchen-it can get a bit warm.  Most of the time the service and food are really good. Steaks good. Hamburgers good.
Like the \"Buttbread\" well enough. Love the salads,my favorite is the BLT salad with garlic ranch dressing! They have a good side of mushrooms that go great to make the steaks even better."}
{"text":"Finally, a place to get an exceptional steak without going to one of the 'Prime' restaurants.  We've been looking since moving here a few years back for a descent steak & I've had some good ones but none as good as here.  While it won't rival the prime cut steaks, it is quite close and at only $21 for a 12oz ribeye and a loaded potato, what a deal. My wife had the spiced chicken pasta bowl and I'd give it 4 stars too, though I thought a little more chicken and less pasta would of been the perfect touch.

The onion ring appetizer is very nice as is the ambiance & service.

While its a 25 minute drive for me, I'd make the trip again and again."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, clean, smells nice, friendly staff. 

Ordered chicken tortilla soup.. had literally no wait and it came out hot, seasoned nicely but not overly done. 

Main course was a rib eye steak which was well prepared and not covered in a bbq sauce so it was very enjoyable. The side was the garlic mashed potatoes... they had a nice flavor but weren't creamy. 

My wife had the prime rib which she really enjoyed and the kids had the kids steak that they inhaled.

Desert was key lime pie and cheesecake, each was delicious and big enough to share, thank goodness for kids coming with lol. Kids meals came with mini oreo packs.

Waitress was Mary, very nice and attentive, generally had my water glass filled before we had to ask and thought to clear the small plates and bread pallet when our dinner came out(something commonly skipped but the extra room for dinner plates make it so much more enjoyable so it was appreciated.)

Only reason for 4instead of 5stars was the potatoes and the fresh bread had a very flaky crust. So much so that upon cutting it the mess  of flakes and crumbs were everywhere... maybe a differing plate or something but the bread itself was fresh and warm."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but it's just always OK. The staff is very friendly but the food is just a little on the disappointing side. 
We ordered the ribs and chicken pasta. Ribs were so cold - and we were there so early and was one of the first people ordering dinner I don't know how that could be. The waiter was so nice I felt bad sending it back but they really needed to be heated up. They were straight out of a fridge cold. The chicken pasta was decent - but very heavy so wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch on a Saturday. Our goal was to have some good food and conversation. The restaurant was so over the top loud that we could barely hear each other speak. We almost left after we were seated because of the noise. From the outside and other reviews we had expect a nice-ish adult type restaurant. The place was filled with children including several that were running around the table next to us. I am a mom and I have no problem with family restaurants, but that was not what we were expecting or wanted for the afternoon. We stayed because we were starving and heard the food was good.

My husband ordered the mahi special which he greatly enjoyed. I ordered the French Dip. The first half of the sandwich was OK, not great, but not bad. The fries were delicious. The cider slaw was not for me but was not bad. The second half of my sandwich was not edible. The meat was too chewy and full of gristle. All of the meat on the sandwich was well done which would not have been my preference if offered a choice. 

The service, however, was excellent. Our waitress was attentive and the manager took my sandwich off the bill.

I doubt my husband and I will return mainly because of the noise level and lack of ambience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get steak. The Delmonico is amazing. Service is usually pretty good. It can get busy at happy hour and on weekends, but hey that's a good thing."}
{"text":"This review is based on the French dip! Awesome,Amazing,and simply delicious! For lunch $17.00 is steep. But well worth it. I can compare this to the Whaling Station in Monterey California. There is prime rib French dip and there are roast beef dips. baby this is prime rib French dips! An overly generous portion of shaved tender delicious slices of prime rib is a crusty roll and the perfect au jus. Not overly salty! Thank you! And also to a wonderful server Stefani, what a doll! Keep her! We will be back soon for more good eats!"}
{"text":"One star for our server. This used to be our go to place. The last 3 times have been the ultimate fail! They recently changed their menu, and now think they can charge 30 bucks for a steak and a side the size of my pinky toe.  Your restaurant is in a mall!!  GET A GRIP!!  Not to mention,  the precious 2 times, the bartenders tried to charge me for a bottle of wine vs a glass while waiting for a table.  Totally clueless.  The last time we were there the hostesses tole us 20 minutes for our table, while we ended up waiting almost 2 hrs for a booth, which I requested upon arrival, but they obviously weren't listening while they gave our table away multiple times. the only reason we went back tonight was bc the manager that night was very nice and tried to make it right.  But tonight at 600 pm on a Friday, the food was crap!! Smokehouse wings-NOT!!!  Fried, with smoke flavor!! My husband's porterhouse was not worth 30 dollars, and I think my son's cheeseburger and my side salad was the best thing we ordered!!  I will also say our server was on point also, hence the one star..never going back...3 times is a charm after being in the business for 15 years.  over it now."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review! At first I did not have the best experience here but after putting in the review firebirds reached out to me and completely fixed the issue and I was very impressed withy second visit o this location. Food and service were amazing and I will be coming again! I'm glad they reached out so I could have a better experience."}
{"text":"Great location. Well staffed. Descent food. Nothing spectacular. Cilantro chicken had good flavor. I had to the mashed potatoes returned because they were cold. In order to have a vegetable, I ordered a small salad with my entree. The salad arrived approximately 1 minute before my meal.  I always enjoy complimentary bread. Service at the bar wasn't very good. They were too busy making drinks to check on me. All in all, a good restaurant in a sea of good restaurants."}
{"text":"First time here, & I was definitely satisfied. First off, the service was fantastic. Not only was our waiter knowledgeable and extra friendly, but so were all of the other staff. I ordered the filet mignon with loaded baked potato, & my boyfriend ordered the coconut shrimp with steak fries. Everything was going great, but then we realized we had been waiting quite some time for our meal to arrive--about 30-40 minutes after ordering. We didn't say anything about it, just kept chit-chatting to fill the time. Our food finally got there, delivered by the manager. He apologized to us for the wait, let us know that our entrees would be free, and asked if everything looked okay. Then our waiter came by right after and said that you should never have to wait that long when you come to firebirds. We were very thankful for this, and went on to enjoy our meals thoroughly. Everything tasted great! It was so nice to have our meals taken care of, especially since we didn't even have to point out that the wait was too long. We will definitely be returning to this chain whenever possible!"}
{"text":"The service was beyond impeccable-it was genuine. My husband and I went for our 20th anniversary-I had to call last minute as our daughter is in the hospital, and we had family come to be with her. When we arrived, the manager we had spoken with had let the staff know this was a special occasion under very special circumstances(our daughter was in the hospital dealing with a serious illness, one of us is always with her). As soon as we walked in, we felt welcome and extremely taken care of. They had a table ready and waiting-with a anniversary wish-everyone went out of their way to wish us a happy anniversary, the meal was one of the best I've had-a mouthwatering crab cake to start, a delish steak, cooked perfectly, with the port mushrooms and mashed potatoes. My husbands prime rib was PERFECT! It didn't stop there-the creme brûlée cheesecake was sinfully delicious!! 
Then, as we were getting ready to leave, the server, Janel, came over and said they would like to send a meal back to the hospital with us for our daughter! Who does that? The amazing staff at firebirds. We have always enjoyed their restaurant, but this was an experience, food that filled our bodies and kindness that filled our hearts.  They made the time we were able to steal away from the hospital feel like a whirlwind real get away, a true celebration of a milestone in our lives. AMAZING food, even better people! Thank you Jason, Janel, Corey and all of the rest of the staff-what an amazing atmosphere and service you provide, truly a class act. If you are looking for a top notch meal, great atmosphere and truly great people, Firebirds is your destination!"}
{"text":"Had both the wood smoked salmon and the bleu cheese filet. They were both cooked very well and a good sized portion. Service was also great. The waitress made sure we were always taken care of."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great company. The steak burger was part of a great combination with the fries and and honey mustard. The charred steak had a great crunch that was a bit salty but to my preference. The fries were fried to a great crunch and a salty finish:) great place."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my first visit here. The managers were kind enough to take notice of my review and cared enough to reach out to me, which I found extremely wonderful in this day and age. They mailed me gift certificates to come back and try the restaurant. They made me feel like they actually cared, something I don't see very often anymore and I was very appreciative to them for taking time from their busy schedule to address me. My second time around, I had a sirloin, which was very good. The service was great and I also enjoyed a nice dessert which was delicious. I thank the management and staff at Firebirds for truly reaching out and caring for their customers. Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Came to celebrate my birthday! All the food was so delicious and the service was pretty spectacular too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is really good; very rich!
We had prime rib & the portions were large & we took some home..
The service is great...
The restaurant is loud- so be prepared for that..!!
I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is simply outstanding!  I've had a few meals here an all have been awesome. Try the COLORADO salad, big sky burger, or rib eye. All great. The bar is great when on your own. Great service, fun people, awesome food. This place rings all the bells."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars based on the hostess/reception at this location. Every time I've tried to call ahead, I get a really snarky response when I try to make a reservation. This has happened over the course of several months at various times of day. For example, called and asked for a table for 3 on a Thursday. Hostess asked \"For tonight?\" in a very non-friendly tone. I respond yes, to which she goes \"We don't have anything unless you want something for 9pm.\" in a very rushed, irritable voice. I've eaten here a handful of times and like the food okay, but it's a real turn-off when they act like your phone call is such a huge inconvenience. It's honestly prevented me from considering dining here as I've called other restaurants nearby and they are always very friendly even if they're busy. Just know what to expect when you call."}
{"text":"Service is great; but the quantity of the food didn't match its price... It was an overall good time with good people."}
{"text":"I dropped in on Tuesday afternoon to grab a salad with a protein.  I ordered the ceaser salad and chose what I believe was yellow fin tuna... the salad was good but the tuna seemed to limp and almost slimy.  I was very disappointed and fondly remember Firebirds standard being exemplary."}
{"text":"This was the first visit for my family and I.  What prompted the visit was a gift card that I had recently received.  My wife and two small kids visited mid-afternoon for lunch.  The service was excellent and very prompt.  I ordered the 12 oz. Aspen sirloin with a loaded russet baked potato.  My wife ordered the 7 oz. sirloin with the sweet potato waffle fries.  They had an excellent kids menu, my daughter ordered the small sirloin and my son the chicken fingers.  They had a great selection of sides for the kids.  

My wife and I thought our meals tasted incredible.  The flavor of the steak was excellent!  My wife and I both thought our meals were phenomenal!  

Our server, Joey, was very attentive the whole time and took good care of us.

We will be coming to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on chain restaurant, but I've been really impressed with Firebirds and can't say I've had a single bad experience.  The service is top notch, the prices are reasonable, and the food is unique, fresh and tasty.

I love anything with their java BBQ sauce, especially the baby-back ribs.  Don't be narrow minded- chains can be good too."}
{"text":"Had the spinach salad with seared tuna added for lunch. Portion size was great. The spinach was fresh and the bacon and dressing were a great combo. The tuna was great by itself but a nice addition to the salad.
Service was attentive and efficient with 100% accuracy in the order. There were 5 diners over the lunch hour.

We had reservations do there was no wait. I can't think of a reason to not give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dining experience. Food, atmosphere and service were good. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Kudos to management. Visited Firebirds last night (Wednesday), which is one of their busier afternoons. I was sitting in the bar area near where servers picks up drinks. My guest and I were behind about 6 waiters and no one had bothered speaking to us. The manager saw this, came over immediately, and asked whether we had been helped and what drinks we would like to get us started. He then introduced us to our waiter who was standing right there already and went about his merrily way. This was excellent management, addressing a problem before it became one.

Afterwards, I ordered the chicken quesadilla. As a whole, it exceeded expectations and was very flavorful. However, the chicken in it was bland and definitely not wood fire grilled. If they prepared the chicken like it was going to be eaten alone and added more seasoning, they would have a perfect dish. Nevertheless, I recommend you order this. It could suffice as a meal alone."}
{"text":"Firebirds is on the Chandler Mall property among the other chain restaurants.  Like Rockfish, they have a great patio with a fireplace.  I've been a few times for a glass of wine, but the best time was on a cold rainy night.  Wine, a fireplace...who could ask for more.  

Well, one could ask for better food.  The food was okay...they have these yummy fries with blue cheese on them.  That was probably the best thing I had.  The three stars are mainly for the ambiance and wine...and the wine list isn't that great.  It's nothing more unique than you would find anywhere else.  And there are better places to go for steak, which is what my dining companion had.  

If you are down at the mall and just want food, and want something a little better than Chili's head on over.  If you are looking for a good meal that you will remember, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a dinner date there last night and the double black diamond martini was a big hit.  My date suggested the steak salad and it was fantastic too.  I usually eat at the Stonecrest Firebirds, so this was my first time at the Northlake location and it was great.  Our waitress Dawn was fantastic and would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary and restaurant week. Food was great. Our server ( Stephanie) was awesome"}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews, this place must be great for dinner. For lunch, not so much. On the plus side, the waiter was very considerate of our sleeping baby. My wife had the roast beef sandwich and regular fries. Sandwich was good but not $15 good. Fries were fries. Now the negative; my burger was not good. It was the firebird special cheeseburger. Not sure what made it \"special\". The secret sauce was about as secret as Big Mac sauce. The burger was so watery it soaked the bun and basically fell apart. I asked for medium well, it was medium rare. The flavor was good, it just wasn't grilled properly. I would have sent it back but when the baby allows you to go out for lunch, you don't push your luck.  The sweet potato waffle fries weren't warm. I didn't finish my meal.  Service was 5 stars, wife's lunch was 3, mine was 1.  Maybe we'll go back for dinner and try the steaks."}
{"text":"This place should start doing reservations because the wait times are getting out of control and people who do the call ahead often call the wrong restaurant.  The cheesecake brûlée is to die for!  If I die young bury with that cheesecake and the filet & shrimp!  It was my first time having smokey tasting food but I thoroughly enjoyed it! The place was not overly expensive either compared to Morton's and Ruth Chris you get a break on price but the same quality."}
{"text":"Decent food, nothing super special.  Not sure why but they crowded us all into one area of the restaurant when there were plenty of tables on the main floor.  Nice atmosphere but would have preferred not to be crowded into the one area on the side. A bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this one. Good food, good service, good drinks. Nothing that stood out as amazing or awful. It's overpriced for what it is.. a chain. I wouldn't go back, not because it's bad, but because there's so many other better options."}
{"text":"Not sure if service is always terrible or if we were discriminated against due to our race... We went for my sisters birthday and we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. When we arrive 15 minutes before our reservation time we checked in but was not seated until 20 minutes after our original reservation time with no explanation... Others were sat first and I was confused as I'm sure they didn't have a reservation at the same time as us. To blow off some stress and kill time while we waited I decided I would go to the bar while we waited. The bartender told the only 3 empty seats were taken for some regulars who will be on there way shobeing reserved for some one coming shortly... I thought that was odd but I said forget it and  just got my scotch and went to our table because it was finally \"Ready\". When we sat no one acknowledged us for 15 minutes and I tried to get everyone's attention but no one even looked our direction. When a waiter finally did come we asked to speak with the manager who immediately made it seem like we were being impatient but said I'll switch your server anyway. I was heated at this point so I walked out and have no intention of going back.

The only reason I think it has to do with our race is because my sisters and I were the only black People there, and it just didn't feel right. No one else was sat 20 minutes after their reserved time, no one else was told you're not allowed to sit at the bar, and no one else when we tried to address the issues get ignored and spoken to like your opinion is not validated"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the food is worth every single penny. Lobster dip was an amazing appetizer and the lighting/decor is very comfortable. Great place for business lunch"}
{"text":"Shame on me!! I've been to this restaurant a few times and I forgot to review it. I have to give a shout out to our server Victoria she,  was a doll!! First of all the ambience is really nice and cozy and pretty. Get your ass early there because you will have a wait or you won't even get in. The bar gets packed and the drinks are flowing and they are delicious and make sure you get the double diamond martini that comes from the giant pineapple that sits on the bar. Ok, they bring out some bread and butter on your table and it's homemade and it's delicious and soft and crusty but way too small for my fat ass bread appetite. You have to order the prime rib. This prime rib is succulent, meaty, a little fatty in the right spots and it comes with an au jus and horseradish cream that is to die for! You get a choice of garlic mash or a baked potato or roasted vegetables,  but choose the garlic mash. I just started a low-carb a hydrate diet so I had to spinach salad with the bacon and the little tiny bits of tomato in it and I think it's some type of a balsamic vinaigrette. I I added on some salmon to mine and it was scrumptious. The piece of salmon is a little bit on the small side that they give you however the salad is so big I didn't even end up finishing the salad or most of the salmon, which by the way they ask you how you want it cooked. The salads are a big deal here my friend had the fired shrimp salad and hers was delicious and my other friend had the fire grilled chicken salad which was delicious as well. The apps are always good. Nobody can make a crabcake like BRAVO for some reason but theirs here aren't bad at all. Overall it's a great place to have a cozy dinner or romantic meal,the service is great, the servers are friendly and informative and the place is just so pretty."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner- I love the sesame crusted salmon with the fried spinach and parmesan mashed potatoes! The salmon is fresh and flaky. The fried spinach is like kale chips- a bit oily, but delicious. I've had better mashed potatoes though- they weren't as creamy as I like them to be. Service is kind and attentive. It can be a bit loud during typical dinner hours (busy!). I want to come back and try one of their steaks next time!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 6 and were promptly seated upon arrival. Our server was fantastic! I had the blue cheese filet (wrapped in bacon) and it was absolutely delicious. Had a bite of the key lime pie and it was wonderful! I had two Black Diamond Martinis and probably should have only had one - super sweet! 

We are looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Service was great and drinks were spot on. The food was uninspired and bland. Food quality was suspect. The price was decent but you get what you pay for i guess. This is off my list, way better options. I can see maybe dropping in for lunch and grabbing a burger but that's it."}
{"text":"Firebirds, how I love thee? You deliver the perfect piece of meat everytime - whether prime rib, sirloin or ribeye. Because of this, I don't even know what other proteins you serve, nor do I care. You always have room for me to sit near the grill where the smell is devine. Your wait staff is well-informed and happy to be at their job. But surprisingly, my favorite thing about you is your loaded baked potato! I'm not sure how the skin is so crisp and salty, and the toppings more fresh and mouth-watering than your steak. Yes, you are expensive and I do not care for your fat-ridden del Monaco. But we should love our favorites unconditionally."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting great staff and the food was even better. Our waiter, Daniel was outstanding and had recommendations ready when asked. The filet was perfect as was the baked potato. My wife had a perfect filet and shrimp that was flawless. The house wine was excellent. The whole experience was top notch would recommend firebirds and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came to Firebirds for lunch after seeing a movie.  We sat at the bar and ordered off the bar menu.  Crispy Cauliflower and Beef Sliders.  My husband loved the sliders and said they are exactly what a slider should be.  Cheese onion beef, pickle and bun.  They did taste homemade and in a good way.  Must be that wood fire grill.  I won't order the cauliflower again.  There is a pretty good but sweet martini.  The Double Black Diamond Martini is vodka soaked in pineapple for 21 days.  21 days is also the same amount of time they age their ribeye steak.  I will be back to try the Seared Tuna Superfood Salad and maybe be back for happy hour.  A lot of older diners but it was midday."}
{"text":"Favorite steakhouse! It has a Ski resort feel to it, so you feel like you're in CO. The salads, steaks, and seafood are all amazing. My family and I have probably been here at least 50 times and the staff is always the best. If you haven't been to Firebirds.... go!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The mashed potatoes are great! I also had the chicken wings and steak and was well done. The service and efficiency from the staff is also great. Chocolate cake is must a get item. So good!"}
{"text":"Great location, friendly and accommodating staff, and delicious food is how I would describe this place. My favorites are the salmon, prime rib and coconut shrimp. For dessert, the Big Daddy Chocolate cake slice is the way to go. It's melt in your mouth incredible!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. First off, the desserts alone are worth the trip to Firebirds, they are absolutely amazing! We also tried their wings as an appetizer. If you are a wing lover I would definitely recommend trying them. They are wood fire smoked and then seasoned, loaded with flavor and their homemade blue cheese is amazing as well. The service is great and so are the steaks!"}
{"text":"Seating took a few even with a reservation.  Service started off kinda slow .  But after finally getting our drinks and taking our order it picked up rather quickly.  Food was very very good .  I will come back."}
{"text":"Had some friends in town and we decided to give this place a try before they left.

Location & Aesthetics -- located off N Arrowhead Fountains Center Drive (on the right) if traveling south, and opposite the Harkins theater.
Not difficult to find as the area is well lit (including the parking area) at dusk with good signage.
Lots of available parking with their own dedicated parking lot/area.
Exterior of the restaurant -- very clean.  Indoors -- very clean and well maintained with subtle decor.  Tables were cleaned promptly from my observations.
Noise level average for a restaurant with the music playing in the background.  

Service -- staff were friendly, polite, accommodating, and helpful from the ladies at the front desk/reservations area to the bar staff and waitstaff.  Very professional and courteous.
We were checked on frequently during our meals and even prior to the meals arriving to let us know that it's coming soon as some (within our party) ordered steaks.  
Even as we were waiting for our meals to arrive, we were given extra complimentary bread to soak up the alcohol.

Menu -- very straightforward - a one-page, back and front.  The same goes for the drinks menu. 

Food -- food was top-notch and very well prepared and presented with more than adequate portion sizes!
Drinks were appropriately made.  I had a couple vodka martinis and they were very smooth -- not too dry or wet.
I had the NY strip steak with fresh vegetables.  The steak was cooked to perfection, not charred, with some pink, juicy and well seasoned.  
The vegetables were fresh, cooked well, appeared to be steamed, seasoned appropriately, and crunchy.
After, our party opted for desserts, I had the creme brulee cheesecake and it's really do die for.  Very light and airy with a lightly crusted top that was probably flame-seared, served with whipped cream that nicely light and airy as well.  It was very decadent and should definitely be ordered on your visit.

Overall, would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here a few months ago for a happy hour drink with my husband. We loved the bar area and atmosphere, so I took him back this month for a birthday dinner.

It's a little loud for our taste, for a Thursday night the place was packed. Our server was awesome and quick and attentive. Our food came fast, refills were quick, and the manager stopped by our table to check out our experience. 

We ordered a shrimp appetizer and several cocktails. We both had salmon entrees. I ordered the crispy fried spinach leaves, and it was the best thing I've ever eaten. I was thoroughly impressed with everything. It was a little pricey but I feel it was well worth the bill! We will be back."}
{"text":"Other than a few small things, this place was really good. Here's the run down:

Pros
-the steaks were great! I had filet. My guy had the prime rib and we both thought it was delicious. 
-my baked potato was aaaaaaaa-mazing
-my boyfriend really enjoyed his mashed potatoes
-he also had the BLT salad and loved every bite
-the creme brûlée cheesecake was super yummy

Cons
-the pours on the wine were really small. Not a great value for the money. 
-my boyfriend initially ordered the macaroni and cheese and it was gross. The waitress happily exchanged it for mashed potatoes, which ended up turning out well (see above)

Best steak place in Charlotte? I ain't saying all that. But a good spot? Yep. Just stop elsewhere for wine before dinner."}
{"text":"I was taken here by some locals. I don't give out the 5 stars too often but this place for the food and the money is very good. I wouldn't put it into the best dinner I have ever had but I have to say the Filet I had was up there one of the best and for the price it was a good value compared to the usual high priced chain steak houses like Morton's or Ruth's Chris. We had a party of 12 with pretty short notice and they got us going and the service we excellent.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here on a business lunch deal. You can tell EVERYONE goes here for business lunches. Got the Salmon which is around $13 dollars. The salmon was very good but the piece of meat they give you is very small. I guess in this situation, it's worth $13 bucks.

I also got the creme brulee cheese cake which was very good. Cheese cake was rich and the crunchy creme brulee topping makes an excellent sound when you crush it with a spoon."}
{"text":"Bug infested patio.  Do not eat outside, have been there twice in the past two weeks and ate outside, received dozens of bites.  When called the manager to let him know he explained that he was not responsible for the conditions of the patio.  It was spayed for bugs periodically and he would look into having it sprayed again.  No apology at all.  Horrible customer experience.  This place needs a serious visit from the public health department.  What a shame for a nice restaurant to be so bad at customer service."}
{"text":"The lobster spinach queso is a must!

I've been here 3 times and never been disappointed.  I've also tried something new every time.."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and was not disappointed! The private firebirds blend label is awesome! I highly recommend it! I had the chicken Colorado salad and it was to die for! The apples is a nice touch! The dining room is beautiful! If you're thinking a dinner night out then leave the kids at home!"}
{"text":"We will be back! Thank you for a great dinner! The first experience at another location was not that great. But the management team was persistent in trying to reach me. I am glad he did. This dinner was much more enjoyable! Highly recommend Firebirds!"}
{"text":"Great girls night out... totally forgot what I had but my friend had the salmon and it was great Oh I had a steak and it was yummy....hot fresh bread was a big hit."}
{"text":"Beautiful steakhouse located near a mall.  We were seated and greeted immediately.  Staff was friendly and service was great.  

Ordered the ribeye wrapped in bacon topped with bleu cheese and mushrooms. Very rich and decadent.   Cooked perfectly 

Southwest rub ribeye was delicious.  You could taste the spice and paired well with the steak. 

Thank you for a nice dinner In az!"}
{"text":"This spot is great. Great for family/entertainment/social gathering and even birthdays. Food is good, service is wonderful and the ambiance is special. Next time you decide to have date night or a meet up place, Firebirds, is your spot."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Very accurately cooked and flavorful steaks, wonderful salmon and good coconut shrimp.vthe mashed potatoes are memorable and even the frenchfries are notable."}
{"text":"If you would really like to be 100% disappointed then look no further then eating at Firebirds. We wanted to have an early Mother's Day lunch and the food came out just as cold as the drinks. It took to calls to be able to talk to the manager who has yet to do anything.
One of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.

So here is an update  Management thought it was ok to serve cold food instead of hot or even warm food. And offered to replace half of or bill... just a slap in the face would have been better."}
{"text":"I've dined at Firebirds a number of time since moving to Charlotte and always return. It's a bustling spot, usually crowded at peak hours, but it's worth the wait. The menu is small but hits all the high spots - burgers (excellent!), steaks, salads, fish and chicken. I've tried the steaks, burgers and fish. I love the crusted salmon with the fried spinach - enough for dinner and leftovers. The triple diamond martini is insanely good (and at the price they charge, it's good that one drink is all you need). The prices are a touch high, but the food is consistently good and there's always leftovers. I will note on my last trip, I ordered the crab cake salad and discovered the crab cakes, though good, had been changed since my last visit. Too mushy and too much filler now for my taste, but other than that, go, eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"BEST burger I have ever had! Shredded cheddar, applewood smoked bacon...always amazing, I come here regularly."}
{"text":"I must say I was pretty impressed with Firebird's. I prefer this location better than the one in Southpark. The decor is trendy and the atmosphere is great! Be careful though, I've tried to go over lunch a few times and the place gets packed. During dinner I got a filet which was fantastic. The service was great. I honestly don't have anything to complain about except it gets quite busy. Which obviously is a good thing in general!"}
{"text":"I haven't been there in quite a while but I usually get their BLT salad and double black diamond martini. Both are excellent. I honestly can't remember much else about the menu and it's been a couple years since I've been. Probably have to correct that oversight."}
{"text":"Food was great!
Service needs work!
Where to begin...

1.  Water never filled unless asked.
2.  Courses were not marked.
3.  Bread plates never provided during bread course.
4.  Steak knife was flicked off bread plate prior to entree delivery and we were abruptly told to keep our knife.
5.  Wine was not topped off.  Ever.
6.  Backhanded during all food delivery.

Worst of all, the manager was \"supervising\" and patrolling the dining room and let it all happen!!!

Firebirds - love the food, but you need to work on your service.  And fast."}
{"text":"We have eaten here about five times in last couple of years. Each time it's better & better. They now entertain reservations not just call ahead. One of our favorite selections  is tender & delicious Filet Mignon and loaded baked potato. Way better and way cheaper than Ruth Kris. Staff is excellent. Bread board is superb and wine list is decent. No complaints from us."}
{"text":"Visited this new establishment Friday night for the first time. Good crowd and energy. Pleasant greeters, waiter, and knowledgeable management. 
Spinach salad was delicious!  My wood grilled salmon was perfectly seasoned, with tasty sides. The baby back ribs did not disappoint my husband. They were fall off the bone and tasty. I would definitely visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Should be 4 1/2 stars. It's close to 5 but I believe there's always room for improvement. I have a new favorite steak house. Where do I start? To begin, a special thank you to our server Tanya-21 for making my Birthday Dinner special. Service was great. While the atmosphere is not intimate, it's comfortable and the food is exceptional. CAUTION: unless you're hungry or with a group; an appetizer & salad will be too much. We started with the Wood Grilled Shrimp. This has to be one of the tastiest appetizers I have had in years. We even finished the slaw/salsa. For the entree's we had the 12oz pepper encrusted sirloin. Again, the best steak I have had in years (the sauce put it over the top). The piece de resistance: Creme Brûlée Cheesecake. Not to sound like a broken record, another home run. A truly memorable meal. Thank you very much.i"}
{"text":"Firebirds is a solid place to have lunch with coworkers or friends, albeit a tad on the pricey side.  My service has never been poor, and often been exceptional.  And there are several menu items I rotate through, so they're far from a one trick pony.

Their Delmonico Steak Sandwich was delightful from the first bite.  Juicy with char grilled flavors that cascaded over my tongue, I found this to be a very satisfying lunch option, especially when paired with the sweet potato fries... and for $12, not a bad price.

When my Grilled Tenderloin Salad arrived at the table, it was visually underwhelming, lacking the creativity I've grown accustomed to with other restaurants.  Essentially lettuce and tomato with some bleu cheese crumbles, with a steak on top.  Thankfully I had the foresight to add egg, which didn't really jazz it up all that much.  However, once I took a bite of that steak, I was completely impressed... with the taste.  At $15.95, it is pricey, but the meat is worth it.

The Bleu Cheese Burger is a must try for anyone who can appreciate mushrooms and roquefort.  A delight for the senses, my friend.  For my side, I went all-out Napoleon Dynamite and had the tots.  They were perfectly crisp... almost too crisp.  This was a completely enjoyable entree regardless.

And if none of these options appeals to you, check out their menu, which is modestly diverse."}
{"text":"I've been to Firebird's twice now.  The first time, I tried the pepper crusted sirloin.  I really wasn't impressed, and questioned whether or not I should even come back.  The steak seemed overcooked, and was very salty.  I had also tried the seared ahi tuna, which was outstanding.  

I would say their beer selection is lacking.  

The second visit, I had the seared ahi tuna again, smoked wings (very good as well, very tender), coconut shrimp (eh, I'm not big into fried things.. I could do without, nothing special).  I then tried one of their specials, flounder.  I was really happy, and the serving size was huge.  Maybe it was all the appetizers .... (heh), but I was stuffed half way through.  

I had a friend who had a horrible time, had to send his steak back twice.  

All in all, I think the food here is decent, stay away from the steak, stick with the fish."}
{"text":"Ate here on 7/2712

Always delicious !  BLT salad with added chicken is so yummy ! Great food & service cannot complain. Is pricey so cannot come here often,but wish I could ."}
{"text":"The food and service was superb. We came for a gathering where they put us in their large backroom, its a nice area with closed doors for privacy. Add that with good food and friendly service and you have a winner."}
{"text":"I had the best salad today it was large portion and very tastefull .waiter was also great today very attentive .my daughter had their chicken  cesadillas which she loved .highly recommended"}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour price wise. Food is nothing to write home about. Bartenders are dull and boring and not much to say.

Its basically a place for old folks to enjoy an early bird and leave.

Skip the sliders on the HH. The dinner ones are good so these ones will pale in comparison. A few nice draft beers for $3 at HH which is very nice. Wish the staff was a bit cooler.

Oh well."}
{"text":"I've been here before and coming back in itself means something.  I can eat anywhere when I travel so a return visit is a good thing.  Ordered the 7oz filet & shrimp because I was watching Forest Gump before I came out.  
Well I can certainly recommend THAT!  Delicious filet, buttery shrimp and subbed the potato for veggies. 
ILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and our waiter Adam did a great job. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Review for happy hour only:

This place was packed on a weeknight and I can see why. They have a good beer selection and their smoked chicken wings are about the best I've had anywhere. They're smoked so they have the smoky taste you usually get at a BBQ place but they also have the buffalo wing flavor you want in wings. 

I'm not always a huge fan of wings but really enjoyed these and would be back here for some wings and also check out a meal."}
{"text":"I recently ate here with two friends, their toddler, my husband, and we had our three month old son with us. We called ahead and made a reservation. I love that they call or text when the table is ready. You could be waiting in your car or somewhere nearby and not have to worry about going out of range. The service was great and the food was delicious. I love that the lemonade is fresh squeezed and $1 goes to a good cause. Also, my husband was a fan of their mojito, which it is difficult for him to find a good one. But, the main reason I am writing this review is my diaper bag. I had a diaper bag with me and a small cooler for the two bottles I brought for my son. I fed him while we were there and put the mostly empty bottles back in the little cooler and sat it in my diaper bag. When we left I thought my diaper bag felt light, but didn't really think anything of it. When I got home, I saw that the cooler wasn't in my diaper bag. So, I thought, maybe it felll out in the car. The next day, it was not in the car. So, I called to see if someone had found it since I had to have accidentally left it at Firebirds. They said they had it. I went to get it and was so  happy to not have lost two good bottles and my bottle cooler. But, when I opened it to check to see if the bottles were there, I was shocked. Not only were the bottles there, someone had washed them. I could not believe it and just had to write a review. I never would have expected that and was very grateful. Of course I rewashed them at home, but was very grateful to not have rotten breastmilk sitting in them. I will definitely return and will recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Staff worked hard to accomodate my party of 44. Service was fast. Food was delicious. Could have cut my filet mignon with a butter knife."}
{"text":"I've had Firebirds multiple times and as usual they knocked it out of the park. Starting with crab cake appetizer and a double black diamond martini kicked the meal off wonderfully. I will say, I used to love these martinis but the last couple of times they have been extremely weak to the point of barely tasting alcoholic. 

The crab cakes were good but the slaw and mango habanero chutney really took this appetizer to the next level. The flavor profiles complimented each other perfectly. 

The dinners we got were the delmonico with a loaded baked potato (perfectly cooked medium rare) and the Parmesan crusted mahi with Parmesan mashed potatoes. The potatoes were average but the mahi was mind blowing. Probably the best mahi I have ever tasted and would recommend anyone wanting fish for dinner. We finished the meal with a alcoholic dessert drink called a flannel pajamas that was absolutely delicious and is not too sweet or too strong. Perfectly balanced coffee and chocolate flavored. 

The food and drinks were awesome but the real reason this was a hands down five star was the service. Our server, Jimmy, was attentive and extremely helpful with menu choices. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My wife loved it. We both had the entree surf and turf which is a lobster tail with a filet mignon with baked potato with everything in it. The cheesecake dessert is the best I ever had from anyplace. I am really wanting to bring the entire family and try the rack of rib. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable! She never missed a beat or an opportunity to improve our service. My food was delicious! Tater tots yummy! Got the grilled chicken sandwich. It tasted amazing and ingredients tasted fresh! The ambience was nice. We were there for lunch and really enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The firebird chicken pasta... IS. TO. DIE. FOR!!!!! And the service is excellent! Our server was quite charming and thoughtful. The entire staff was friendly from the time we walked in til we left. 

I would definitely recommend this place to any and everybody in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love love this place for the prime rib dinner. My wife and I go here for special occasions usually to enjoy the prim rib and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at Firebirds and we were highly disappointed! It was recommended by our hotel unfortunately. The service was basic at best and the food was lukewarm. Our server was not attentive at all! The drinks were horrible. Is there anyone in Charlotte that can make a proper Old Fashion?!?! We went here in hopes of celebrating the new venture, instead we spent the evening waiting for the server. Our appetizer took forever to come out to the table and once it did, it was taken to another table by accident first. Our salads had brown lettuce in them, which was obvious to even a blind person. My steak was overcooked, so I switched entrees with my friend and she even felt it was overcooked and she eats her steaks med-well. Her pasta on the other hand was decent, but it still lacked one of the main ingredients, THE CHICKEN!!!! I had maybe 4 pieces of chicken at most and it was not because she had picked through it. Neither of us finished our meals and we were never offered desert. Keep in mind, the server rarely checked on us, except to pass us on the way to check on the table behind us. But please believe that her presence was felt once the check was on the table. She came by the table more then to see if my card was in yet then she did the ENTIRE meal!!!! We even had to wait on water refills. If this is the type of service that paying customers should expect, I suggest no one ever dine here!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. We have wanted to try this place and, finally got to. We made a reservation cause the place is always packed. We will be back."}
{"text":"Me and My Boyfriend wanted to go out for a nice dinner, he had never been to firebirds so I wanted him to try it. We walked in there was a 20 minute wait. We waited patiently than we were sat and the lady walked up didn't even introduce herself just asked what we wanted to drink. Then she dropped off the drinks and walked right away, when she finally came back she asked what we wanted to eat, my boyfriend ordered steak and I asked her what does she recommend, she was no help she just said steaks are good salads are good, ect. So i ordered a salad with chicken. Our food comes out and I take my first bite and then i notice there is a hair in my food... so I sit patiently not eating my food and my boyfriend started to eat, she walks by and asks my boyfriend how his steak was but didn't acknowledge, so I told her there was a hair in my food, she replies do you want the same thing or something else? no apology...  Than the manager brought me my salad and than apologized. She came by a little bit after and said I hope it wasn't a hair from my pony tail, you don't make jokes about something like that.  Its hard for me to go anywhere because I work in a restaurant but I try to be fair. This was the absolute worst service Ive ever had... ive had better service at chick fil a. Will not return."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service.  The salmon was perfectly grilled and needed nothing else. The vegetables were sautéed to al dente. The steak medallions melted in your mouth. Combine that with a comfortable atmosphere and Firebirds is a winner!"}
{"text":"Very good food and good service. Extensive kids menu as well."}
{"text":"Love Firebirds.  We have been going to their other locations for years all over the valley.  This is their newest location and is close to home.  First impression is a very comfortable and familiar environment like the other locations.  We went on a Friday night in prime time and the service was great from the hostess stand to the bar staff and the wait staff.  Food came out a little slow because they were busy but two different managers visited our table to apologize for the delay.  We were not in a hurry so it was no problem at all.  Food was great as we have come to expect from Firebirds and we are thrilled to have one close to home."}
{"text":"i gave them another try for happy hour with a friend a couple of weeks ago. I believe firebirds redeemed themselves and i would probably return.  the martini's were perfect and service was very nice and pleasant.  we also shared an appetizer and it was yummy. just to play it safe i will upgrade to 3 stars and increase after a few good visits."}
{"text":"The service was top of line. My steak was amazing it was so tender it fell apart without even using  knife. The salad was one of the best ive had. Its a little pricey but you def get what you pay for!!!"}
{"text":"I know they just opened so I'm going to say they have time to work the kinks out.  
We had reservations the Friday before Father's Day thought we would beat the crowd. 
They were busy and the hostess wasn't the most pleasant. But the gal that sat us was friendly. I think the hostess was a lead or something since she was telling the others how to fix how tightly wrapped the napkins were at the tables. 
Anyways. We waited maybe ten minutes and got sat. Our server was great! He had great energy and recommended the spinach lobster queso to start. He told us it was full of chunks of lobster and homemade chips so we were sold! It came out very quickly and we were quickly disappointed. It should just be spinach queso because it was super tasty but there was literally two pieces of lobster in it. 
My dad ordered the house salad with their special cilantro lime vinegarette. It was pretty good sized for a starter salad. Then we waited. And waited. 
Finally just under an hour later we got our entrees. Husband has a burger with literally five fries. Five! Granted they were thick cut. But really? I joked he must have ordered the kids meal. He ordered it medium well and it came out well done and dry. 
My dad ordered the delmonico with a baked potato. His delmonico was super grizzly and fatty. Half of it wasn't edible. But the potato was large in size. 
I ordered some kind of Asian sesame salmon with a side of seasonal veggies. Salmon was super salty. I'm guessing soy sauce was in the marinate. Thankfully the sauce it came with helped. But what bothered me was it was overcooked and the salmon skin was still on the bottom.  The entree came with fried spinach? Which was just wet greasy inedible and the side of raw carrots and raw snap peas. 
Then more waiting. And finally I ordered what I had wanted since I got there. Creme brûlée cheesecake! Now this did not disappoint!! 

In the end we spent 2.5 hours there. Not because we were socializing and enjoying drinks. But because we were just constantly waiting. I was surprised we never once had a manager stop by to say anything. Our server was great and dessert was delish. 
Hopefully things get better for them."}
{"text":"Love Firebirds on Rea.. Food has always been great.  Salads are cold - as well as the silverware. It's the small things that make this place so great. Love the Double Black Diamond martinis.  The Salmon, Delmonico, and ribs are fantastic."}
{"text":"Very good. When I want to meet my friends who live in the city for dinner, we often meet here. Options for everyone on the menu, healthy (if you wish), and great service. It's a chain but with great food and service. Food is tasty and I just about always try something new. As such, I don't have a favorite but I would recommend it. It can be pricey though - for me (alone) I usually pay about $40 for an entree, shared app, and drinks."}
{"text":"We have never had anything not delicious from this restaurant.   The best prime rib, the best salads, you name it.  Firebirds is well worth every penny! Great service as well.   I do wish they would bring back the desert pear martini though.  That was my favorite drink in the city!"}
{"text":"Solid meal. Huge portions. Ask for sauces on the side, otherwise you'll drown."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place when we want a nice dinner in a casual atmosphere. A family favorite is the ribeye, but they have excellent salads and the salmon is delicious as well. You HAVE to try the fried spinach, too.
This place gets pretty crowded during peak hours. I personally don't think it's worth more than a 20-minute wait, but I'm impatient.
One thing I have to say is that they are very customer service conscious. During our most recent visit, when the manager came to our table to ask how everything was, one person in our party mentioned that her steak was a little overcooked for what she had ordered. He took one look and offered a new one. When she refused, he had 2 desserts ordered for the table instead. Also, sign up for their emails and you get discount coupons in the mail and something special on your birthday."}
{"text":"I ordered a BLT Salad to start. The BLT salad was served with ranch dressing. I ordered a Slow Roasted Prime Rib encrusted with fresh herbs and pepper. Also, served with housemade au jus and creamy horseradish sauce.  My prime rib was served with a loaded baked potato. I wanted a lean cut of prime rib and they still gave me a piece that had a lot of marbling.  In any case, I still enjoyed the prime rib. I just had to eat around the fat.  I also ordered a Creme Brulée Cheesecake Squares with blueberry and red fruit sauce. The meal was very enjoyable.  Equally important, I had a server that was pleasant, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great environment.  Friendly, attentive service. Good food.  Definitely a 'go-to' for those times you want a good dinner experience without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"The steaks here are always flavorful and grilled to PERFECTION! Also, we had Debbie as our server and we couldn't have asked for a better one! She is was extremely accommodating to all of our requests! All of the managers at this location are so awesome as well! I come here every time I vist!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great staff. I had the Kobe beef meat loaf, with spiced pecan green beans, and garlic mashed golden potatoes. Also started with lobster spinach ravioli. All great food and great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Although i had a to go order. My service was better and my food was hot and ready. I order my favorite BLT Salad with Salmon,carrot cake, and warm chocolate brownie... I thank you Firebirds for your attention to my last review. Im pretty sure my next visit will be a sit down and will be just amazing as in the past minus my  other encounter.."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to say that after our last subpar experience we were contacted by Rita in the corporate office who went above our expectations and invited us to return for a meal on the house. So yesterday (5/14/16) we gave Firebirds another try as we were celebrating the birthday of my fiancé. We had amazing service this time with Sierra and tried new dishes we fell in love with. Then as I was hoping they remembered that we were celebrating  a birthday and gave my fiancé a free dessert and a bday card. The manager came by and checked on us and it was a very lovely experience for us both. We will definitely be back!! Thank you Rita!



(My first experience): Amazing food but I was really disappointed in our service! We went there to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and told the hostess. When she sat us she said enjoy and happy anniversary NONE of that info got relayed to our server. We were sitting there almost 6 min without any acknowledgment and after looking at the menu we already knew what we wanted to order. 

We ate our amazing food and enjoyed our time together but prob won't be back because the service could have been better. :("}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers while training in NC. Seemed like the spot for Cisco workers as there were about two other tables of various sales managers having dinner meetings. Had some sort of steak which was good but forgettable (Longhorns was better), but what rocked my socks was they Double Black Diamond cocktail which was pineapple infused vodka with more pineapple. So good, I think I had two!"}
{"text":"I love firebirds and eat here often, they have one of the best hamburgers around if you are willing to pay the $$ also addicted to their house salad... great specials during the week and the bar area is a nice place to relax, especially when its cold and the fireplace is going."}
{"text":"Went to soft opening and food was amazing. The crab cakes were probably the best I've ever had. Our steaks were amazing, no sauce needed. I had the French fries and husband had mashed and both were great. Would come here again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and got carry out the third time. The food is good. The service has always been great and the restaurant is nice. The bread they give you in the beginning is delicious seriously  delicious! Will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Bad service and subpar food. - Although I'm late getting this review up, it is based on a summer visit in 2015.

Sorry for the poor review, but beware of terrible bar staff and over-priced food. The website images portray something completely different from our experience. It looks fancy on the website, but I feel sticky and dirty when here. It's casual, regardless if everyone who works there does wear black.

We sat at the bar and ordered beers and waters. We got the beers but not the waters. No problem, we moved seats to get out of the doorway breeze. Our new seats had an adjacent seat where a customer just finished and the dirty plates and glassware sat there the whole time we were there. When we asked again for water - we never got them. Then I feel we were personally ignored except when we called over the bar tender to order the pretzels. We again asked for waters and again did NOT receive them. Third time's NOT a charm. We took a couple of bites of the pretzels and lame cheese and decided to pay for our beers and leave. Since it took 15 minutes after requesting our check to get one, I feel this review is fair. The food was subpar and the service was horrible. 

This wasn't even our first time here either, so please do not think this is one isolated event. There is also sometimes a smell, like sulfur which can be avoided by pouring water down the drains. It gets strong, so in the past we've had to just leave because I can't stand smelling that and trying to drink beer or eat."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite restaurants around - I meet up here for my girls night out and it's always  good food and wine and ambiance. You have to get the filet mignon kabob - one of their best dishes!"}
{"text":"Great salad with candied walnuts or something in it.  The filet mignon was also very tender and very tasty.  Great dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a celebratory dinner here last weekend. Great prime rib, good service, no wait to sit at the bar and we both agreed it was more fun anyway. The garden salad was actually amazing and the key lime pie was pretty good too. I would probably get the sweet potatoes over the baked potato next time, but will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A good friend and I meet at firebirds a couple of times a year. Most recently we went on a Monday night. They half-priced bottles of wine on Mondays.  We got the ahi tuna appetizer. It never disappoints. The spicy mustard and the mixed greens salad pair perfectly with the tuna. We also had a blt salad. That dressing..yum! 

For my entree, I tried the sesame crusted salmon for the first time. It was perfectly cooked. The greenbeans and mashed potatoes we're fab too. 

Try the cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"Lobster Queso Dip and the BLT Salad! Amazing!  Make sure you save a little bit of the fresh baked bread for the bottom of your dip bowl....yummmm!  Bravo Firebirds"}
{"text":"Great Experience at this location. What originally attracted me to this place was the drink special that they have on Wednesdays (which essentially marks certain drinks down half price). I would have given this place 5 stars but when we originally arrived we were told by the hostess that unless we had a reservation, we had to wait over 30 minutes to sit even though there were many empty tables available. So, after sitting in the parking lot for a while I decided to check on yelp to see if I could book a reservation through open table. I did and there was a reservation for the exact time that we were trying to be seated. So basically, the hostess lied. 

Aside from that, the customer service was great. The bartender was super nice about explaining the menu and letting me make last minute changes. The chicken quesadilla was really good and I like that the sour cream came on the side just in case I wanted to take it home and had to reheat it. The beef sliders were really good as well and there was a bar bites special for those.

The entire night I stuck with the double black diamond drink which was described as fresh  pineapple infused for 21 days w/ New Amsterdam and garnished with a sweet pineapple slice. It doesn't sound all of that great, but it was one of the best drinks I've ever had. And it was only $5 on Wednesday... I drank at least 3 or 4 because it was that good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is art. I order the aged ribeye medium cooked perfectly taste amazing. I can taste the wood in the steak and full of flavors. Our waitress Abdullah was amazing with the best service. I strongly recommend this place since it is my best steak restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Absolutely had a great dining experience tonight. Food and service was excellent!!! The staff was very friendly, even though they were very busy. I had prime rib, and would definitely order it again. Next visit I'm going to try a filet ( my friend had that tonight and loved it"}
{"text":"This place was great! Nice atmosphere friendly staff. Food was amazing...very impressed with my peppercorn crusted sirloin as well as the green chili mac n cheese. The food did take a bit longer then expected and our server did seem like he had a bit more then he could handle. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I took my brother and mother here for his birthday and her mother's day dinner tonight. The service was great and all but the appetizers and entrees took a long time to get to our table. Also, when I ordered my steak I asked for medium well. They gave me a steak that was more than well done.. It was burnt, very dry, and hard to cut into! I complained to my waiter Daniel saying it was burnt and he apologized. He told his manager and his manager gave me the steak I wanted which was medium well. I was still a little disappointed because I waited half an hour for it to be cooked. My family was already done eating so I just told them that I'd take it to go. I was expecting a little comp for their mistake. Usually a good restaurant will do that when they make a mistake obviously this one didn't care.. I don't think I'll ever be back here and I didn't even enjoy my dinner with my family. If you dont wanna wait long for your food please dont go to this restaurant well at least this location."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this restaurant. Ordered take out when we had company, called at 6:30 and was told 25 min, arrived at 7:00 and was told by the hostess our 'server' would be with us shortly. Stood there until 7:10 and asked the hostess about our food and she seemed surprised no one spoke with us yet (while I was standing in front of the hostess stand the whole time).  Finally got the food at 7:18, paid and left, we ordered two of the pineapple chicken entrees - got home and saw it was just plain grilled chicken - they forgot the pineapple salsa on the pineapple chicken! I wish I checked it before I left but after waiting almost an hour for a take out order that was supposed to be ready in 25 min I just wanted to get back home. Meanwhile the food was COLD so I'm pretty sure it was ready when i got there at 7:00 and they just didn't get their act together to bring me my order. It was so embarrassing serving cold food to our guests and 'pineapple' chicken without the pineapple!"}
{"text":"We wanted to go out for a family dinner (my best friends, their kids, and I) before I went to the airport and headed back to Vegas. We came in here because they (the fam) had always had a good experience and, I heard, the food was good. 

The kids had the french dip and raved about it. The baguette was toasted and buttery, the generous portion of steak was tender and juicy, and the au jus was perfect. They raved, too, about the crispy steak fries that came with it. I tasted the slaw and liked it, though the kids didn't care for it. I am going to go with personal preference on that one. It wasn't too sweet and, I thought, complemented the heaviness of the rest of the dish. 

I opted for the Caesar salad and the crab cake appetizer. The \"small\" Caesar wasn't small at all but a good portion of fresh romaine, thinly shaved (melt in your mouth thin, amazing) Parmesan cheese, and a robust, flavor-packed dressing. I opted out of the croutons but said yes to the fresh-cracked pepper. Very, very good. 

The crab cakes were a bit on the small side for most people (I don't eat that much so it was fine for me, but I can see where others may want more). They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with a good portion of real lump crab. I wish there was a little more crab and a little less of the breadcrumb-mix-filler. It wasn't bad, but - and in part, because of their smallish size - the delicious lump crab texture and flavor was a bit of a tease. Focus more on the crab, less on the cake. 

That said, the mango chutney that came with it was great. A nice contrast, it was sweetly tart made with real fruit. The slaw that was included, a little different from that the kids' had with their sandwiches, fell flat. The nut seeds and tortilla strips made it too busy. Stick to the plain slaw and it will be that much better. 

The Mr. and Mrs. each had steaks, a ribeye and a sirloin, respectively. His was, as ordered, a perfect medium to medium well (blasphemous, but that's not the restaurant's fault). Hers was ordered rare (cool red center; I love this woman) but came to us more a medium rare. Add to that it seemed it didn't rest long enough, she explained to the waiter that the flavors were amazing... but it wasn't cooked to order. Not only did they give her a new plate - including a fresh serving of the roasted pecan green beans we all helped to devour - the manager delivered it himself. The new steak was cooked perfectly, rested properly, and tasted great. 

Side note: When the steak was returned, it was great to see the staff huddle and talk about it. Obviously we couldn't hear the interaction so what we viewed as them using this an opportunity to learn and improve the service may have been a discussion on how horrible we were... but I doubt it. ;) The staff was amazing, they took the time to do it right, and no one seemed put out or offended. This was a big plus! 

And then... dessert. Three words: Creme. Brulee. Cheesecake. The cheesecake was light and flavorful. What made it special was the real brulee-style, hard sugar crust on top. Not only great in texture (and, a bit of a novelty on a piece of cheesecake; *thwack, crack!*), but it had a great, fresh flavor that went well with the rest of the dessert and fruit accompaniments.

Definitely a great meal in a great atmosphere with great service. A few little things aside, we will happily return.

----

Full disclosure: The manager took care of the Mrs.' entree. The rating comes from the food, service, etc., not from this. It was a nice, unexpected surprise, especially because they replaced it quickly and it was perfect. Still, important to be noted."}
{"text":"Great for a fancy dinner! This place is great and I always end up taking the rest home. Pretty good customer service. Although it may take a bit for the food to come out, it is worth it! I recommend this to families that want a fancy dinner!"}
{"text":"For a while after I discontinued being a vegetarian due to anemia, it took me a while to become accustomed to eating any type of meat again, but this was especially so for red meat. I would crave a steak though (once in a long while) and where would I venture to? Firebirds, of course! I've been here countless times and the service I receive is always top-notch. Servers are always knowledgeable about the menu. The ambiance is a bit more on the intimate side: lighting is definitely low. We usually order bottles of wine when we come here. My dad usually takes care of that though, but always ask your server! They are quite knowledgeable about their wines, as well. 
So okay I had one mishap here once. We had a man serving us and I can't recall his name (this was post-veg) but I remember him being so sarcastic and rude about me ordering my steak not medium or even less cooked. Sorry, I'm eating it. I'm also paying for it. So if you have a problem with that, you obviously have way too much time on your hands and need to invest it into something else besides trying to facilitate what I am consuming. 

Anyways, besides that, generally everything goes well here and I never saw that server again so maybe he isn't around anymore. :) 

Oh. Order the brownie. I know you'll be stuffed after your phenomenal steak with potatoes, but this brownie is truly to die for."}
{"text":"They never disappoint. I dine here regularly and my go to is the shrimp salad. The staff is ALWAYS thorough and very warm."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here for the first time with my girlfriend. We were seated right away, the staff was friendly, service was on top of it and the food was amazing. I'm one of those people who like my steak well done and don't want any blood and typically do not get the exact steak I'm looking for. so I'm hesitant to try new places when it comes to steak. Not only was my steak cooked to perfection but it also was oozing with tons of flavor!! Just how I like it! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Firebirds is one of our go-to restaurants for a \"Mommy minus kids\" night out with girlfriends!  

The servers are always knowledgeable and courteous!  If you ask for any suggestions or what new menu items are like, they're always right on.  

One of my favorite items to order is the Lobster Queso for starters!  It's yummy...nuff said.  I also always get the BLT salad with my meals, it's one of the best!  Bread is always fresh and yummy!!

I usually order the Prime Rib dinner and it's always cooked to perfection!  I have also tried their burgers and many of their sandwiches and they are always good too!

The most favorite thing I love about Firebirds now is that you could make reservations online!!  I always avoided Firebirds on weekend nights because I knew there would be at least a 90 minute wait (if not longer) before we were seated!  Now that's fixed and it's always my first pick when asked \"Where should we go?\"!"}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers during lunch and was pretty disappointed. First off, I've heard from friends and colleagues that Firebirds is pretty fancy which is why it took so long for me to eat here so I did have high expectations. 

Service was great for our party of 6. I had no complaints on that end. I'm not sure what the party size for gratuity is but we weren't charged so we all tipped well since the service made the lunch. 

I ordered a burger thinking that it cannot be messed up. The burger was a little more firm than I prefer. It also wasn't juicy at all. It had the appearance of being handmade but tasted like it was shipped frozen. Also, the buns were stale. My coworker ordered a chicken sandwich of some sort and got her bun switched out. When she received her new sandwich, they literally put chicken on a warmed bun and took it back out. She was missing all her toppings like cheese, sauce, etc. I didn't want to even bother switching mine out at that point. Another coworker ordered the shrimp tacos and raved about it. The other coworkers ate but didn't comment on the food- guess it wasn't anything special.

If I do return, I plan to get a drink at the bar. They looked really good."}
{"text":"We got there at 4pm and it was very quiet.  There just a handful of patrons.  The outdoor patio was empty.  We were meeting a friend for \"Happy Hour\".  One draft beer, one diamond cocktail  (pineapple based) and one margarita later we were ready to order a second round and some appetizers. JR ordered the beef sliders with parmesan garlic fries, Ron got chicken tenders buffalo style with the parm/garlic fries and l got the shrimp appetizer.  The boys liked their food. JR thought the beef sliders were over-done, thus dry. Ron enjoyed his chicken tenders.  Chicken tenders are made ready to please most guests as it wasn't spicy  (Rom prefers spicier flavors). My shrimp was not my fav because it was smothered in warm thousand island mayo.  By 5:300ish, the house was packed, patio filled up, it is definitely a popular joint!  I give very high marks to the waitresses who attended to our table, they are outstanding, personable and we couldn't have asked for better service!  Food is in my view very average 2.5 to 3.0.  Beverages were very tasty.  Atmosphere is very inviting, comfortable, a very nice hang out at the end of the day, say... Friday, TGIF!  I can't review their dinner menu at this point but l hope it is better than their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for Father's Day dinner.  We called at 4:15 PM and told them we were on our way.   They added us to the list.  When we arrived we were told it would be about 15 min.  The place was packed so I never thought we would get seated that soon.  

We sat at the bar and a very friendly bartender took care of our cocktails.  The recommendation for a white wine was spot on.  Excellent, friendly service.   Fifteen minutes later we were seated.  We were so impressed. 
 
Our waiter, Tom, was wonderful.  He explained the special and answered our questions.  My husband ordered the black pepper sirloin steak.  I ordered the pecan crusted trout.  Our meals were piping hot when served.  The food was amazing.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  The trout was such a large serving that I ended up taking half of it home.
  
My husband's favorite dessert is Key Lime Pie.  Firebirds had the best Key Lime we have had in a long time.  

Even though it was a holiday, Tom never rushed us and checked on us several times.  He was so attentive to anything we asked for.   We had such a nice time."}
{"text":"Having been to another Firebird's location in the past I was looking forward to checking out the Southpark location and enjoying a good steak.  We were greeted by a waiter, who asked for our drink order, I asked for water to look over the wine list, when another server arrived and asked for our drink order.. Should have known there that this night wasn't going to be so great.

After placing our drink order our waitress returned every 2 seconds to see if we were ready to order, which by the third time in less than 10 minutes I felt compelled to place our order, yet still somewhat undecided.
We ordered the 14 oz Prime Rib and the Surf and Turf entree. The Prime Rib was excellent, cooked perfectly and served with a light au jus and horseradish on the sade. However, the filet was very rare for my taste, after requesting medium, so I did send it back. Returned a perfect medium, which I enjoyed than very much.  As for the lobster, grilled to perfection, although no butter dipping sauce, bummer!
The food was good, but would have expected better for the prices and some of the other reviews. 
Unfortunately the service was the most disappointing part of the evening. After being stalked for our order at the beginning of the night that is all we really saw of our waitress, Adelene.  We never saw her again until one of the other waiters told her we were looking for our check, ridiculous! I had to flag another waiter down to have my steak corrected, and another waiter to order a second drink.  I wish she focused more on customer service rather than whatever it was she was focused on..I think it would have been a much better experience."}
{"text":"My first visit here was great !! I ordered the meatloaf which was great with one exception the gravy was too salty. Margaritas were also great !! My friend had the spinach salad with beef tenderloin which was fabulous. I can't wait to go back and try other specialities.. I will definitely recommend this place to others great setting and great food!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and appetizers.  Prices are right and a little more upscale but casual."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to frequent the Firebirds in Ballantyne quite a bit.  Loved the \"aspen\"-like atmosphere and wood fired cuisine - so we were stoked when they opened the second location in South Park, about 2 miles from our house a couple years ago.  

At first it was great, just as good as Ballantyne, but my guess is that  a different manager took over, because it simply is just not as good as the Ballantyne location any longer.  Everything has suffered, the food quality is less, service is meh, and you just get the impression whoever is running the place is trying to turn it into an Applebees - seriously... an Applebees.  

Seriously?  Buffalo bites on the menu?  Balloons tied to the tables for Valentine's day?  c'mon, this place is supposed to fall somewhere in between Outback and Ruth's Chris, and instead of moving their offering towards the prime steakhouses, they're falling backwards!  

I will say, the lobster queso appetizer, even though over the years has steadily decreased its lobster to queso ratio, tastes great.  They have a salmon entree that's also delicious.  Also when order a steak, you can get a \"side\" salad for like 5 bucks - which is huge, definitely big enough to share with your date.  

My problem is, I want a steak when I go there, and the meat quality at the South Park location is bonk - even compared to the one in Ballantyne.  I can say that about the small and large bacon wrapped filets, the prime rib, and the ribeye - all have gotten tougher and grizzlier over time.  

Honestly the best part of this place is the bar area - it's a great place for drinks after a day on the grind.  This place is being relegated into \"lunch-only\" territory for me."}
{"text":"I really like this place. We came here for my wife's 40th birthday with my in laws. It is a nice and dimly lit restaurant at night to help set the mood. The staff was very friendly and we were seated in a timely fashion. Our server was very attentive and we never had to wait for refills. The only reason it is a 4 star review is that my steak was overdone and the bottom bun on my son's burger was toasted solid. They fixed it quickly and comped those two meals. Even though we had a few hiccups, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This review is for their brownie and coffee only. Their dessert is fairly good. The BF took me here for a treat, as I've been craving chocolate all week and haven't had any. The brownie was alright, a little dry around the edges, but it came with a salted caramel sauce that was veeery tasty. The coffee was also fine, and the service was good. I'd think about coming back here for dessert again, especially if it is late ish at night, since they are open until 10."}
{"text":"I went here last night with the BF and his parents, and overall it was a good experience. I had made a reservation for 7, but we got there at 6:30, so we had to wait. Luckily, it was happy hour! We got two margaritas (some specialty margarita with agave nectar and deliciousness), a miller lite, and a blue moon. All of that for 17$....pretty good deal. They sat us a bit before 7, so that was nice (especially because the wait time was 60-70 minutes without reservations). Our waitress was very nice and helpful. I had the delmonico steak and it was delicious! Spicy and perfectly cooked.... It came with southwest au gratin potatoes that were just ok.... The BF and his dad got prime rib, which was good (but not nearly as good as mine). His dad really likes this place because they will give you real horseradish if you request it (not just the sauce). His mom also enjoys this place despite the fact that she is a vegetarian. They are very accommodating, and she got a salad and a potato and was happy with that. Oh, and I had a 10$ off coupon they sent me for my birthday through their e mail club...so definitely sign up for that. 

Despite the fact that this place is a chain, I would come back here...they have quality food."}
{"text":"Me and my lover came here for New Years Eve dinner. We basically just found it on Yelp and made a reservation. 

It was packed when we arrived but not overwhelming. The place was decorated so nicely for New Years with balloons everywhere. I started off with the Mirassou Pinot Noir wine. This was delicious and extremely smooth. For our entree, I ordered the Filet Mignon, medium. When they first brought it out and I tried it, it didn't taste medium at all. It was actually more well. Our waiter took my plate back so they can re do my order. A few minutes later the manager came over to apologize for the inconvenience. When they brought out my new order again, the manager was there to make sure it was exactly what I wanted. 

Even for a medium, I felt like the Filet was a bit dry. However, they have spectacular customer service. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 6, Olivia was our waitress. She was sweet and she recommended some great food. My steak was wrong and I don't really like to send things back but it was well done and I refuse to eat anything over medium. She took it back and had them make me another, the manager was also very nice and offered to get me anything else I needed while I waited. Overall it was a great birthday dinner and my friends and I really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not given one of my favorite restaurants a review!  

Firebirds provides a great balance of quality, options, class, and price.  It's not a high end steakhouse, but provides a more relaxed approach to a similar meal.  Their prices are also closer to that of an Outback, though they cost more, the food can't even be compared to the standard chains.  The service at Firebirds will be great - they have the place overstaffed with very friendly and competent servers that will stop by just frequently enough to ensure you have what you need.   

For an appetizer, get the lobster queso.  It has chunks of claw meat in it, definitely worth grabbing to go with the warm bread that comes out.  

Their steaks are good, the wood provides a nice flavor and they get the temperature good, you won't go wrong here.  Their fish has always been tasty, flaky and well prepared.  I have not had a piece that had a fishy taste to it yet.

Sides are standard - baked potatoes, tasty salads, fries, etc.  One thing unique is Fried Spinach - it's definitely worth a try as it's crisp and melts in your mouth, but not very filling, so I'd order it as a la carte for the table to sample.  

One of my favorite things to do is to stop by for lunch and get a burger.  For the price you'd pay at Hickory Tavern/Chilis/etc. you get a large juicy burger that barely fits in your mouth with a side, AND you get good service!

Wish they had slightly better beer prices, though they do have half priced bottles of wines one day a week - how about half priced pints?"}
{"text":"Great place for business lunch at Firebirds Wood Fired Grill at Chandler Fashion Center. First time here.  Very good service, had the Delmonico Steak Sandwich with tater tots. Excellent cut of meat, very tender and ample portions. Upscale dining experience. Noise level was not excessive and great ambiance. Lots of dining choices in area. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming to firebirds
I will consider myself an official fan of theirs. So, tonight was the last night of Restaurant Week ..I ordered chicken and corn chowder( starter) the salmon w/veggies and polenta (entree) and brownie Sundae (dessert). I enjoyed everything...my friend ordered the tortilla soup..I will be trying that next time.
I pretty order salmon everywhere I go..I will say that the encrusted salmon on there traditional menu beats out the one I had tonight..although it was great..the other one is better.
I could have done without the dessert..mediocre..could have saved the calories..
The waitress Indya was great."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our first trip to firebirds. I was disappointed with the filet and my husbands del Monico was grisly. I loved our waiter Donald. I knew him from another establishment. He is awesome! The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing. The bar area is gorgeous. We'll come back sometime and try something else. It was quite pricey though. So we'll see."}
{"text":"What a great experience surrounding a perfect dinner. F a friendly hostess met us at the door and introduced us to our waitress Bridget. Bridget by the way is a very personable waitress who demonstrates experience well beyond her years. Her recommendations were spot on, perfectly appointed and well paired. My main course was a chili rubbed Delmonico steak. I am a steak snob as a majority of steakhouses fall short of meeting my expectations, Firebird not only met, but exceeded my expectations. I was blown away by the flavor and tenderness of the steak first bite to last. 

A testament to a good restaurant is whether you would go back. I can say that I will without a second thought."}
{"text":"I set up a lunch for a small group with a set menu.  Worked with Michelle Rodgers, the food and service was wonderful!  Everyone enjoyed the food and our two servers were very attentive! I highly recommend Firebird's!"}
{"text":"Update.....I was contacted by management and invited back to rectify my horrible experience and I was absolutely impressed with the service and food. This is what I expected to experience the first time. I am extremely happy with the way management listens to feedback and understands the importance of customer service.  Our server Jayme was excellent.  Thank you. We will be back.


Went for an early dinner on a Saturday night.  It was my daughter's birthday as well. Was disappointed with our server because we ordered light dinners instead of their steak dinners and felt ad soon as we placed our order we were treated differently....even caught him talking to another server shaking his head then turning and looking at us. I was very upset. We still ordered soup, salad, a burger meal and a kids meal not like we split one meal with 3 people. I have gluten allergies as well so am limited to what I can have. Anyways. We will NOT BE BACK"}
{"text":"Firebirds was our third choice for lunch after the first two places were closed for the holiday weekend. And I can see why those places were closed, as there was very little going on today. We were one of only three tables occupied the whole time we were eating our late lunch.

We opted to skip an appetizer and enjoyed the tasty bread while we waited for lunch to arrive. It didn't take long. My wife had the French Dip which had a nice big bowl of jus for dipping. I had a standard cheeseburger (I think the waiter misheard me as I wanted the blue cheese burger, but it worked out okay). Both came with awesome fries that were perfect. I mean, really, really perfect fries.

Nice comfortable restaurant. Enjoyable."}
{"text":"I meant to give this review awhile ago and I'm just now getting around to it. We went to Firebirds South Park. For my birthday a couple months ago and it was my first time dining here. We were greeted and sat promptly.  I'm a server and I have to say our server Joshua gave the most outstanding service I have ever had. He was imformatibe, engaging and funny,  attentive and was just on point. I don't like cake so all the servers signed and gave me a card which I thought was a really nice touch. The food was excellent as well. We will definitely be back! Of course I would love to have Joshua as a server again. The whole experience, from the food to the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Met my cousin for dinner the other night. Very attentive service (I love having my water refilled without asking), but my burger was very ordinary for $11, although my wife's spinach/salmon salad was good. This style of restaurant is not usually my forte anyway, and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about how great this place is so I decided to try it out for myself. First impression was terrible because of the snotty attitude from the host. She did not bother to even say the usual \"Hey guys! welcome to Firebirds\" or any of that. Just grabbed the menus and started walking towards a table.. that just brought the entire vibe down. 

When our waiter came, we got the same negative energy from him but he warmed up a little towards the end. Seems like they were all tired and ready to go home. I can say the coconut margarita was amazing and the food actually made up for all the bad attitudes we received. Might go back again but not to this location."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Service gets an A+. Food is amazingly excellent (try the green chili mac & cheese!). The bar is also very good. The Black Diamond is excellent & so are the margaritas."}
{"text":"I just ordered takeout. Wonderful experience while I was picking up the food. The food was delicious I didn't even have to heated up because it was still so hot. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the the wood grilled pork tenderloin medallions with polenta! Was really into the meal and didn't get the young man server's name, sorry dude! When the whole staff works together like they do here,  it is great! 

I usually eat alone and often get token service...but this was not the case at Firebirds!! The hostess, server, cook, and the manager all did everything possible for a tasty, relaxing dinner and I really appreciate it!! KPZ"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD. REALLY a good lemonade. This is one of my favorite new place to eat. The atmosphere is great. Elegant and I like coming here. It make me feel good and the service is good to. Its one of our top 5"}
{"text":"Being from Texas we like our steaks.  This place had a great cut of beef, I had the 9oz FILET MIGNON.  HArd to go wrong with this tender cut, and there was nothing wrong with the steak but I ordered medium rare, well when the steak is 4\" tall it is rather hard to get it cooked, and it was completely raw and cold in the center with being very rare all the way through but the outer 1/8\".  If it wasn't such a great grade of beef I would have sent it back but it was still good, just under cooked.  My suggestion, cut the fillet a little thinner to cook or butterfly it if the kitchen can't get the center the right temp.  There is always using a thermometer and lowering the cooking temp too.  Other than that, no complaint."}
{"text":"The service was actually quiet good, they were attentive, polite and knowledgeable. So I guess your asking why only two stars? They basically got the two stars because of the service. The food was awful. 

We had the Lobster Spinach Queso, which tasted like it was nothing more than melted Velveeta, completely absent of any additional flavor. For my entree I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Fillet (medium-rare) and the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes. The potatoes tasted just like the queso with the only difference being the excessive pepper they mixed in for flavor. 

As for my steak, I knew I was in trouble when I asked for Bearnaise Sauce and the waiter responded they don't have that on a regular basis (although to his credit he did ask if they would make it special). When the steak actually came the piece of bacon that was wrapped around it was actually 100% fat (yes I know bacon isn't the leanest cut of meat- but they could have used better) and the medium-rare was actually closer to blue-rare (110 degrees F not the 145 degrees it was suppose to be). 

To summarize, I am sure it is a great place to grab a drink at the bar, but as for the food- there is a Wendy's right across the street."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and went to Firebirds based on Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed.  Great food selection.  We enjoyed the bacon wrapped filet with blue cheese topping.  One of the best I've had.  Service was good and we lo ed the environment and atmosphere, casual but classy.  Best mango mojito ever!  Highly recommend Firebirds."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was fantastic! I ordered the pineapple Mahi with pecan green beans, the green beans were to die for! Cocktails were delish too! Even has a small patio to sit outside. Very cool place."}
{"text":"Another update:
Had a need for a steak on Saturday night and because I had not eaten since breakfast, I stopped in around 5:30 PM for a quick and early dinner.  As usual, the food, service, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Never heard of, similar to Woodfire? Not sure, have not been to Woodfire either. Visited for a business dinner, the sesame salmon was very tasty, would order again. When I asked if the fish was wild, the answer was sort of. Sort of means not farmed in land, but apparently a contained area in the ocean? So an ocean farm? New one on me. I particularly enjoyed the side of fried spinach, you do not see this often and it is not always done well. The atmosphere is conducive to date night, business, etc, slightly more than casual and the service is good. I will look to see if there is a location in chicago and I would return to try more."}
{"text":"We went and have a wonderful dinner.  We liked everything about the restaurant.  Upon arrival, there was a line up, but fortunately I called ahead and we were immediately seated -:) - The appetizer Lobster Spinach Queso was amazing !, The waiter was really patient with us, he brought us a few tasters until we found what we liked, then we ordered our bottle, and the salads great too !..   The steaks... WOW, each one of the 3 of us had it cooked to perfection.  If I was to say anything, upon entry, it was loud...the music a touch too much so... but when we were seated in the pit, the ceiling was so high, the sound was not overwhelming at all. My husband is a pretty picky steak eater.. and he'd definetely go back !  Joyce H."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a rare kid free date so we decided to try Firebirds. The menu options look all sound with really decent pricing for a steakhouse. We tried two appetizers- the ranch rings and jalapeño deviled eggs. Both super delicious! For our entrees we had the delmonico and the pepper crusted sirloin. Loved both especially the delmonico! Super flavorful. Honestly probably my first time eating steak without some kind of steak sauce. Side dish was the Parmesan mashed potatoes which were also outstanding! We'll be back to try more menu options! Service was adequate though could have been a little better. No major complaints though."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I have never, ever had a bad meal here, and I have dined here at least 10 times...maybe more.

The food is wonderful...freshly made to order, consistently excellent, and the bread always arrives hot, fresh, and ready to slice.

If there is anything wrong with Firebirds, it is the service.  It's TOO eager.  I was asked no less than 4 times during my lunch if \"everything was okay\".  Once or twice is enough.  

Other than that, the food, atmosphere, and price were fine.  It's really my favorite place to dine in Chandler."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch or dinner... Inside area has a Houstons type atmosphere and there is generous seating on the outdoor patio. Visited ths week for lunch, service is very good and friendly. Lobster cheese dip was excellent choice for appetizer. Spinach salad extremely good. They hv a nice wine list with 5 or 8oz pours and priced accordingly. The restaurant is located in the busy Chandler Mall area and there are alot of nice eateries to choose from but this is one of the nicer ones."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and i have to say i am hooked on their steak burger! The only place that actually serve a steak (not ground beef patties) on a burger.  If you are craving for a steak and burger all at once, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Prices here seem to always be higher than my last visit. That being said, they have to have the best ranch dressing in the world! Try the BLT salad with a chargrilled chicken breast on top. Delicious."}
{"text":"I went to Firebirds last night. 

I called ahead just to see what the wait was like and they said at the moment, there was no wait. As soon as we got there, we were seated in a booth (of our preference). Our waiter was very nice. He even remembered the person with me from the last time they were there. Since it was my first time there, it meant a lot to me to see that type of appreciation. 

I ordered the BLT Salad which has so much applewood smoked bacon on it that I was in heaven. Prior to that we had the Lobster Queso appetizer which, to be quite honest, I wish I could have eaten like soup with a spoon. 

The atmosphere was pleasant. Business casual type of attire. Not an incredibly romantic place by any means but still would knock a dates socks off if you took them there. 

Overall, if I could give this place more than five stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on our wedding anniversary. Had steak. It was a little on the salty side, but cooked well. There was nothing that really stood out about the restaurant other than that. I'd go back when I want a little more \"upscale\" meal."}
{"text":"Been here several times. My best experiences have been with the meatloaf. The last two times I've ordered a ribeye cooked medium-rare. Both times came out rare and bordering on bleu. The manager noticed me eyeing the steak this time, and he insisted I let him take it back. They cooked some of it to mid-rare, but the rest came out medium, which I was afraid of. My wife's salad with shrimp and goat cheese came out without goat cheese. They corrected it. This is a good restaurant, but I can cook a way better steak at home. I'll stick with the meatloaf from now on."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of other firebirds and they're all good but the service here was amazing. Sat at the bar. Bartender (Candace) was very knowledgable about wine and made a great pairing suggestion. We had seared ahi tuna and mahi grilled tacos. Outstanding. . We joined the inner circle and can't wait to come back. Very highly reccomend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Well, since I signed up for their email promotions when we were there for Yelpy happy hour, Firebirds were kind enough to send me a $10 off coupon for my birthday. So I took them up on it yesterday, my birthday. 

Got there around 2PM solo and sat in the bar to watch football. I ordered the Grilled Tenderloin Salad:

Grilled and sliced beef tenderloin over a bed of mixed greens tossed with bleu cheese crumbles, diced tomatoes and a tangy balsamic vinaigrette with a glass of Simi chardonnay. I also opted for some bread since I was going to do without dessert. 

Can I just tell you how freaking much I loved this salad! And their dressing was so yummy, I was think of do shots with it! 

The meat was cooked to my perfection (med/rare) and Simi wine was de-lish. Oh and their freshly baked bread should be banned! I could have eaten several of them, but I was good since I dieting. 

I can't wait to get that salad and wine combo again - maybe I will use my VIP card they handed out at the Yelpy happy hour. 

Oh, and my waiter/bartendar was fab as well!!! 

Thanks Firebirds!"}
{"text":"Not sure what it is, but I most def prefer the other location - much more intimate. Also the salad was smaller here... The steak a bit more rare than I like, but ate it nonetheless. 

I sat at the bar to get my steak salad and glass of Simi chardonnay -- it was a bit drafty, I was a bit cold - it chilled my steak. 

I think I will stick to my regular spot.... But still love the salad! Thanks"}
{"text":"I came here by myself because non of my fellow conference peeps wanted to walk 10 minutes to dinner.  I'm glad I made that short walk to here because I enjoyed eating their prime rib.  It was cooked just right and it was rested correctly.  Needless to say, I was so stuffed that my 10 minute walk became a 15 walk back to the hotel."}
{"text":"Really 3.5 star...but solid, sometimes excellent food with great atmosphere and decor.

Why the average review then (By the way I still go once a month due to it's convenience)

Prices are maybe only $5 bucks cheaper than a  Mortons or Ruth Chris steak...and the quality of the meat is not even close...again the flavor of the steak is good.

They do the community waitstaff strategy....I get that the restaurant gets extra turns that way....but I HATE it....I purposely have to slow down to enjoy my $120 meal with my wife.

So really good, really convenient and good ambience...yet overpriced, rushed, and leaves you feeling empty inside...kind of like making out with your ex.

FOLLOW UP 2/13:   On a very good note, they did contact me regarding my review letting me know they appreciate the feedback...not sure if it will change anything but very nice touch."}
{"text":"Steak was wonderfully aged and melted like butter.  The grilled vegetables were awesome.  Service was very pleasant.  Would go again"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable place to eat! 

We decided to stop at about 730pm on a Friday night and while it was very busy were weren't waiting long for a table. We sat at the bar and ordered some Blue Moon drafts while we waited. Very tasty. 

We were seated about 15 minutes later at a very comfy booth. I ordered the 22 oz prime rib. My guest had the grilled shrimp and strawberry salad. 

We were brought fresh bread, still hot from the oven, to enjoy while we waited for our entrees. There's really nothing better than fresh bread, in my opinion. 

The entrees were a little slow to come out but my guest was very pleased with her very beautiful and tasty salad. My herb roasted prime rib was delicious as well and came out cooked exactly as I had requested. The mashed potatoes I had as a side were very tasty as well. 

If we disregard the time it took to get our entrees, I would say the service was fantastic. She was very attentive and seemed to be conscious of not interrupting the conversation. 

The price was reasonable for a steak house type dinner and I most certainly consider this place as superior alternative to Outback Steakhouse or Black Angus type of restaurant. 

I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Their chicken caesar salad is one of the best i've ever tasted. You can definitely taste the wood grill flavor in the meat. Wouldn't recommend this place for a family dinner that includes kids but It would be a good place to go for a drink, their bar is impressive. Casual ambience as well. Overall I was satisfied with my visit here."}
{"text":"This was my first time to firebirds and I must admit it was a pleasant experience dinning here. They sat us immediately, decent pricing and good variety on the menu. Atmosphere was nice and warm. The only issues we experienced were my chicken pasta had bacon in it and I don't eat pork but they corrected the issue right away. Also my friends steak was really fatty and tough to cut. I am not a big fan of grilled steaks so I couldn't really judge, it looked tasteful to me. But I will say, the chicken pasta was awesome! The manager came and chatted with us and made sure we were satisfied. I would not hesitate to go back to this place, if I ever come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Hey I love the steak sandwich and pineapple martinis. Great atmosphere, the people are friendly, the lines are long but worth the wait, and the food is very good. Also the bread they serve before lunch or dinner is incredible. This is one of those places you have to go so you can wonder why you've never gone before."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely AMAZING! We had delicious steak, outstanding service and an overall wonderful experience at this place. We were very impressed and would definitely eat here again. We took the kid with us and she ordered off the kids menu and was very happy with her dinner. Husband ordered a rib-eye and I ordered prime rib. The prime rib was to die for and is their specialty. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a good steak and good service and feel free to bring the kids along... It's not that kind of stuffy steakhouse where kids are looked down on. Another cool thing that they do is they have a call ahead service to get on their wait list. We were not aware of this since it was our first visit so we waited about 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday night, but many folks walked right in and were seated as they had called ahead. It's in a busy area with many choices of restaurants, but this one definitely will be one that we go to again."}
{"text":"Food: everything was really good except my French fries. They were undercooked which is a misstep on their part. There were four of us. Three of us started with the chicken tortilla soup. Delicious. Probably not healthy as it is served with a small dollop of sour cream in the middle, but definitely delicious...and I'm not a huge soup guy. Entrees included the blackened tuna tacos, grilled shrimp tacos, some salad with fried chicken on top and the seared tuna. No complaints by anyone. I had the shrimp tacos and I'd definitely get them again.

Service: fine. We didn't really test them, but everyone was polite and attentive.

Atmosphere: casual, bar restaurant feel, think of an Outback Steakhouse type of setting.

Misc: I'd gladly go back. I doubt they'd undercook fries next time."}
{"text":"So far so we have been waiting for more then the told 40-45 minute wait by I take it the head hostess girl who was in front of computer.The hostess is rude and very impolite she asked for name and then number and could careless so she asked for name again. 

when I asked about how much longer she was very rude.

The waitress was pleasant and the food was decent.

It's just a big turn off when the hostess has a careless attitude when asked how much longer I was treated like I was being annoying to her.

Tip to the management to train employees to have a professional attitude and remind them what their job is."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a early dinner here while I was in Charlotte with a friend on a Monday evening. As expected it wasnt busy. We were promptly seated.

Half price cocktails and wine on Mondays! So of course that made me extra happy lol

We started with the Lobster Spinach Queso, served with tri-color tortilla chips. This never disappoints. Most of the lobster drops to the bottom so dig deep for the full experience. 

Our server was friendly and prompt. Our water was always topped off and promptly refilled also. Nice hot bread too. But it wasnt busy so I didnt expect anything less. Great service! 

I ordered the Wood Grilled Salmon with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies (squash, onions, carrots & broccoli). The salmon was impressive and it was well seasoned. I would say that salmon is on the list for best salmon from a restaurant... and the portion was perfect. My meal along side a nice glass of wine really made my dining experience memorable. 

My friend ordered Grilled Chicken Breasts (don't know the menu name...) which was served with mashed potatoes and garnished with two huge onion rings. She said the chicken was moist and delicious, so I would recommend her meal also. 

I wish they had Firebirds in Maryland.... *sigh*. So the next time I'm near a Firebirds I hope to get similar service and great food!"}
{"text":"Long live Firebirds. I have been coming to Firebirds for years but never the south park area location. The bar set up here is awesome compared to the other locations i have gone to . I brought my mother here for a mothers day lunch.We started off with the strawberry basil lemonade which was oh so refreshing! Of coarse for some strange reason i don't care how many times i come here i always get the same dish which is the  encrusted salmon with friend spinach and mash potatoes. My mother had her heart set on ordering meatloaf so meatloaf it was for her. She mentioned the meatloaf was very tender and she would definitely order that meal again. I would be shocked if anyone that has been in Charlotte more than a year hasn't been here, if not make your way there."}
{"text":"It was ok. It was very loud and echoed. So the ambiance was just ok. I ordered the sirloin the waitress said it was good a choice since I wanted a leaner cut. The steak was tough and didn't have a lot of flavor.  The baked potato was fine a little light on the butter and sour cream. The outside was covered in salt. The creme brûlée cheese cake was very nice. The staff was nice and we had good service. I am not dreaming of going back but maybe some day I will try it again."}
{"text":"Way over priced for what you get. My chicken dish was very dry & the ribs definitely were not fall off the bones...very chewy. Service was terrible. The bread was still frozen in the middle when we FINALLY got it...drinks didnt come out together...2 came pretty soon & the other 2 we had to ask 2 more times before we received them. All 4 of us were disappointed & I doubt we will go back....too many REALLY GOOD restaurants to choose from in Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service and food.  I usually get the Coconut Shrimp or BLT Salad both excellent.  Carrot cake is to die for!  Mary in the bar is the BEST!"}
{"text":"I feel like there's not much to say for me so far as Firebirds is concerned. I have been a few times, both when I ate meat and didn't, and each time I've walked away relatively satisfied with the experience, but not blown away.

This time, I went for my younger brother's birthday dinner. It had probably been a couple years since the last time I came and so I went in with an open mind. We got the onion rings and some bread for the table, both of which were enjoyed by all of us. Apparently the ranch was to die for, but I cannot personally vouch. 

We then moved on to the main course, at which my family got steaks, and I got vegetarian kabobs. Although they are not on the menu, my waiter kindly informed me that they are an option to ring up, which was definitely good to know. The vegetables were good, although I didn't think the grilled format worked super well for the zucchini or squash. Still, the balsamic glaze pulled the dish together and it definitely did the job.

One of my family members did have to send their food back because it was cold, but the restaurant handled it well and we all left happy. The mixed drinks seemed good and the salad my family got was enjoyed as well.

Overall, decent food and great service. Better local places to get a meal though."}
{"text":"Third visit to Firebirds.  First two times for our 33rd and 34th wedding anv and totally loved the place. Food and service was outstanding.  This year we returned to celebrate a birthday.  First of all the food was outstanding, the lobster queso amazing,  the prime rib the best I've ever tested , the carrot cake awesome.  So food was great but this time a couple of glitches with the service.  1. Ten minutes after we were seated before our server arrived. 2. Turn down the volume of the background music please. Place is already noisy enough with folks conversation.  3.  Our main course was served to us 5 seconds after our salads arrived.  A big big no no.   
But overall a good experience and we'll certainly be back"}
{"text":"Oh crap.

So good. So good that I kept saying \"This is so good...so good...\" while I was allowing beautifully moist, perfectly grilled, and flavorful pieces of Filet Mignon dissolve on my tongue. This was in between happy bites of grill lobster,  rich and buttery.

Yes, this meal was a bit pricey - 39 bucks from the Surf n Turf, but if I was gonna do it? I was gonna do it right. I recently started eating meat again, so we came to a Steakhouse. Sorry cows...

Anyway - Service was great, the drinks were tasty, and the food was incredible.

I recommend ending with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake for dessert, and starting with a well crafted cocktail.

Boombastic fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's a little more pricey than I'd prefer but, the atmosphere is good and the waiters are definitely a sight for sore eyes. ;)"}
{"text":"My mom and I went for lunch Thursday. We sat in the bar area. The spinach salad is my favorite entree at Firebirds. It was delicious. Our waitress was very friendly, attentive, and fast. My mom likes the bread & butter served prior to entrees. My mom likes the hamburger & Tatar tots."}
{"text":"Service was excellent but the steak was pretty chewy. My colleague ordered a steak medium rare but it was served medium. I would go here again but probably order another cut of steak."}
{"text":"Dinner with my SisStars. I ordered the smokehouse chicken sandwich and tater tots. Both were prepared well but the tater tots were a rare treat! The bread prior to dinner tasted good but was so hard, I actually felt it was ridiculous to have even served it! They tried three times to bring softer bread and failed each time. Over all, a strong 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love Firebirds! In fact, I love it more than a lot of the Upscale, more expensive places such as Ruth Chris. The Lobster Spinach Queso is so good with the homemade chips and also the Ranch Rings. My go to meals are the Salmon and the Ribeye!! So flavorful and the portion sizes are sure to fill you up! Their steaks are so tender. If you ask me one of the best steaks around. They also have really good drinks. I suggest the Sangria and the Pomegranate Sunrise. Service is always fast and they are always friendly. Once I baked a cake for a birthday dinner and they put it in the Refrigerator for me. My cake was falling apart because I didn't let it cool appropriately before leaving the house. When I asked for them to bring it out, they put candles in it to try to make it look as presentable as possible. It wasn't necessary as we just wanted them to bring it out but it was soo hilarious!! It looked so ridiculous, We loved them for that. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Lots of good memories in this restaurant.  I know it tends to get crowded at times, but I think my family and I have lucked out (or we either plan for an early dinner when we come here).

Our server Nadie was awesome on Friday.  We had a large group of six and she was very knowledgeable about the specials and also the wine list when we asked for recommendations.  I had the Chicken and Pasta... which she warned me about the spice.  I told her to \"bring it on\" and the pasta, chicken, and sauce were excellent.  Our table also tried the lobster queso - which was scarily addicting... watch out or you may fill yourself up with bread and this appetizer dip.  It comes with chips, but the bread dipped in it was the best combination ever.

I don't know what came over me, but I finished my entire portion.  I did run a 5k the next morning, and felt a little on the heavier side when I woke up, but it gave me some good fuel to burn off."}
{"text":"I've been to this Firebird's a few times but this review is based on my most recent visit on May 11, 2010 for lunch.

There were 8 of us for a business lunch.  4 of us are larger than normal men.  We were placed at one of the round tables that may have fit 8 smaller people comfortably but we were all uncomfortable at this table as there was no room to move once we were seated.

The should say something when they give your drink orders that it's going to be a while until you see a refill.  Eventually everyone received a refill except for me.   What's so hard about refilling unsweetened iced tea?  

On the meal, i asked for a side green salad without the pecans that came with it.  I watched the server write this down so something got screwed between typing it into the ordering system and the preparer because the salad came out with pecans on it.  I'm allergic to pecans but I picked them out anyway the best i could.  I should have sent it back.

At this point I'm still waiting for a refill on my tea as the rest of my table gets refills on their drinks.  

Finally the meal comes out and I am able to snag another server to refill my tea.  

I ordered a pasta dish.  Well the penne pasta was undercooked.  At this point I feel I'm a customer at Hell's Kitchen.  So I drink my tea.  Wrong move.  

The server came around to check refills on drinks and was noting everyone.. Twice I had to tell her to refill mine as she missed it the first time she marked it down on her mental list.

Finally a refill.  But it was gone in no time.  Do I dare ask for another one?

Well I wasn't paying for this meal but I were, I wouldn't have tipped well and it only instance of bad service for me to stay away.  This may be it for me."}
{"text":"Hard to believe it has been two years since last visiting Firebirds in Chandler.

Last night's visit was just as spectacular as the first one.  The food was impeccable, service outstanding, and comfortable just doesn't seem to fit properly to describe the venue.

I had the beef kabobs, medium, which came perfectly grilled and removed from the skewer.  The grilled vegetables had just the right amount of scar on them.  Outstandingly sweet tomato chunks and other fresh vegetables on the second skewer.  The green chile mac and cheese was perfect, just the right amount of heat in an oh so creamy cheese sauce.  My side spinach salad was wonderful, perfect amount of dressing and the right mixture of ingredients.  It will be my main course the next time we are there.

There were six in my party last night and every food item was prepared as good as it gets.  The crab cakes were packed with 80% crab and 20 percent crumb at a minimum. I'm glad to know my second choice of entree would have been divine too.

Finally, Kelly was our server and boy did she shine.  All of us at the table love to banter and get to know our servers.  She held up admirably and made our night that much better. Her kindness and desire to make sure we did not want a thing was exactly what I would want in all of my restaurant visits.  Thank you Kelly for being the outstanding person you are and stay in school to help assure that bright future ahead of you.

Folks, this is a great place to kick back, get a glass of wine, some appetizers and then the full meal deal.  It's cozy, warm, and inviting.

P.S.    It was my birthday and they helped me celebrate by having everyone sign a birthday card and bringing me a candle to make a wish on.  It almost felt like home, really.

Go Now!"}
{"text":"I went here the day before Christmas and they exceeded my expectations.  We made last minute dinner plans so I thought there was no chance I could get a reservation a few hours in advance.  However, they scheduled a reservation at the desired time and sent me a confirmation text.  The weather and traffic were nasty so I arrived about ten minutes late.  The place was packed so I was sure we would have to wait some.  But we were seated immediately.  The food and service was great.  The entire staff was friendly and delightful."}
{"text":"For my first time at the restaurant I had a very nice visit. The staff were polite and the food was amazing. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good meal and great atmosphere you can't go wrong with Firebirds.  

We go here annually to celebrate my husband's birthday and the food has been consistently good.  We just went tonight, and although walked into the restaurant at 8pm on a Monday night it felt like we were walking into a party at 10pm on a Saturday night!  The place was hopping!  When we go we are always seated promptly and the service is really fast.  

My personal recommendations are the filet, the ribs, and the flourless chocolate cake.  The cake is a MUST, it's really that good!"}
{"text":"Great lobster queso appetizer and creme brûlée cheesecake for dessert. We always eat here for special occasions. Entrees are all great, depending on your taste and the service is always great as well."}
{"text":"This was a great dinning experience as we had a 40th birthday day party and it's one of their favorite restaurants, and they come all the way from Queen Creek.  

Our first time at this concept, we decorated our table to the hilt, we were early and the Chris, the manager and staff were very helpful as we set up for the memories for tonight.

They do what more restaurants need to do and have two servers assigned to the large party and service goes twice as fast.  Our servers, Linda and Ahmad were very good, he was a little slow getting the checks to us and processing.

Surprised they needed more check presenters too.  Also a little annoying to hear expeditor in kitchen calling out orders and we were at wine bottles across the room

Food was very good, our meatloaf and my favorite, the salmon was excellent.  Excellent onion rings without the oily after taste.  The steaks, ribs, and chicken were all well received by our gr

We look forward to our next visit and the opening of a Firebird in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go.  I almost always have the Filet with a loaded baked potato and a glass (or two) of merlot. The staff is always courteous and quick, the food is always cooked perfectly- it is a little on the pricey side though...Especially if you have any drinks while you are there."}
{"text":"Did I just eat at a Michelin star restaurant? No ,but we where treated like it. Alex is a fantastic associate ! And the entire staff are phenomenal, from the time you walk in to the time you walk out 100% satisfied with the meal you ate to the money that was spent on it. 

I had my wife's surprise 40th birthday here ,I had one of my wife's friends flown in and we had her dress as a server for the big Surprise.  the staff went above and beyond to make sure it happen as planned, from turning her into a server, hiding  her in the back until all our party had arrived. Could not have been happier with the outcome. 

This is our favorite restaurant,  and hope it will be yours. 

Thank you Firebirds !!!!

{"text":"I have been to Firebirds many times and will continue to go.  It is a delicious steak house that has many other items that are great for the whole family.  We always start with the ranch rings. They are perfectly breaded and crisp and come with a garlic ranch dressing that everyone in my family loves.  Every time we go my daughter can't seem to get enough of the wood fired salmon.  The best part is that the salmon is on the kids menu so it makes it a little more affordable.  For dinner I have had the Firebirds Chicken Pasta, it was creamy and full of flavor.  Cilantro Grilled Chicken breast that was perfectly cooked with the parmesan mashed potatoes I couldn't get enough of the jack cheese sauce.  The Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon with mushrooms and bleu cheese was so good that when I was finished eating it I could only think that I wanted more.  My niece recently tried the Sesame Encrusted Salmon with the parmesan potatoes and fried spinach.  The salmon left the plate quickly between her and my daughter, who helped her eat it when her salmon was gone, the fried spinach was something of a mystery.  At first when the spinach enters the mouth there is a crunch and then it just melts away leaving a salty taste that soon disappears.  Odd yes delicious yes, it was great with the salmon, or at least my daughter thought so since I don't like fish.  Mr C got the Baby Back Ribs and enjoyed them making a perfect mess of himself.  They brought him a warm wet towel to help clean up, thank you.  The Chile Rubbed Delmonico has this delicious rub that makes the meat melt in your mouth.  The meat itself is very fatty which I normally wouldn't even try but the rub gave it a flavor that was worth the fat.  Everyone in the family has tried this and most everyone has ordered it at one time or another.  To finish the meal we always get the creme brulee cheesecake.  The crunch sugar top with the soft and creamy cheesecake and the graham cracker crust with blueberries and strawberries and a strawberry sauce makes this a beautiful end to a perfect meal.  We have never been dissatisfied and have always received great service. They have a great wine selection, with beers that satisfy my beer snob husband and coffees with liqueurs that help to end a meal on a high note. The price isn't bad for the food that you receive.  Take family or friends and enjoy a night out."}
{"text":"When man invented fire, this was what he intended to purpose it: Perfectly grilled meat! An online banker buddy from San Diego was in town for training, so I decided to meet her for dinner. This restaurant was across the street from her hotel and sounded really interesting. Turns out, I was right.

Since neither of us are big eaters, we decided to split and entree and add a side. We were both eying the blue cheese filet medium rare (great minds think alike!) Sara mentioned that sprinkling some of the blue cheese over sweet potato waffle fries is terrific; I thought the addition of green beans would help balance the meal. They actually brought out our meal on two plates (perhaps this is common now, but I remember having to portion split meals myself). The filet was perfect. Perfect!! The blue cheese slightly melted into the meat, crispy bacon tucked around it all. Adding a bit of the cheese to the fries were phenomenal (seriously, you have to give this a try). The green beans with candied pecan pieces added a nice fresh crunch to the dinner.

As much as I *hate* to drive long distances, I really would consider returning here just to have what I'm certain would be another terrific meal. Thanks, Western Union, for picking up the majority of the bill."}
{"text":"Mainly for our server, Abdullah!!! He was so great, we showed up at happy hour and he gave us the best drink recommendations. The food was awesome. I order the sesame encrusted salmon and it was so flavorful and a great portion. My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with baked potato, and he stated it as \"a classic\". Abdullah provided us with a complimentary cheese cake dessert that was glorious. We will
Be back!!"}
{"text":"Ate there during the last restaurant week.  Good food...had a blackened steak....vey good.  Have tried to go back on a Friday and/or Saturday...too many people to wait though.  I generally take this to mean the food is good.  Having said that I'm not willing to wait, so I move on."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this is an amazing place for a dinner date. My girlfriend and I had our first date here, and we loved everything. From the Filet Mignon, the Chicken Pasta, and the Caesar Salad. Surprisingly the Caesar Salad was perfect, I've never had a salad that made me say \"Wow I could eat this for every meal\" before this. Something about the fresh ingredients and the right amount of pepper and dressing made it so perfect. My girlfriend enjoyed the Filet Mignon, a perfectly cooked medium-rare center, which I've had a problem with most places when ordering their filet mignon's where they aren't properly cooked through. The wood fired grill could really be tasted, a nice Smokey flavor that was cooked right into the meat that made it just that much better. The chicken pasta that I enjoyed had perfectly cooked chicken, which I've found to be not so common in chicken pastas. I usually get dry or wet chicken, or even undercooked or burnt chicken. I didn't find one flaw with my dish, and it came at a price of just seventy dollars for our meal. It's not extremely pricey, and it's a perfect night out. I would surely recommend this restaurant to any prom couples."}
{"text":"Love love love their \"usually\" fresh bread and their food is fantastic. My husband and I frequent here a lot and have seen some horrible servers and a lot of turnover, but the food is always magnificant!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waiter came by one time to take my order and bring me my drink. I saw my food on the counter sitting for ten minute before it was brought to me. I have eaten here a few time but this is so far the worst. It might be a bad night for them but it was on a Wednesday and it was not busy."}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant. Service was great. Prices weren't bad at all. Food was 8/10. Maybe it's what I ordered but the Diablo Burger (I think that was the name?) was just ok. It was flavorful but a little dry. Our fries were cold but they were quick to correct the problem. Would try this place again once they get some of the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Um, this time around was disappointing. 

Decided to enjoy some dinner here on a Friday evening and surprised that it was only a 30 minute wait. Once I was seated, I was excited to get my drink order in and order an appetizer. Our table was finally greeted by our waiter for the evening, James. We received drinks and he said the he would be back with straws... after 12 minutes, we got those straws. Afterwards, he walked off and proceeded to help other tables without even stopping by to see if we were ready to order or answering any questions we may have. I also now realized that we were informed of any specials, as he'd done with other tables. Finally, I was over it and called him by name the um-tenth time that was preparing to walk past our table and asked if he was ready to take our order. We placed our orders and he walked off. By this time, I'm not happy at all because I've frequented this location numerous times and never experienced such awful customer service. Meanwhile, we never received bread... it was only after I pointed it out to him that we'd not gotten any that he said, it was in the oven only to return 1.5 minutes later with luke warm bread; must've been an easy-bake oven. 

The straw that broke the camel's back for me...after consistently walking past our table, he proceeded to take a group picture for the party next to us and stepped between my seat and the wall... unavoidably bumping my chair and holding the phone over my head to take the perfect shot! No, sir! 

Let me tell you how the manager, Jeremy SAVED this location from us WALKING OUT and gaining 2 stars for an already 1 star review I'd drafted on my phone!!! 

Jeremy walked over to ask if everything was ok (by this time we'd received cold Lobster Spinach Queso from our waiter)... I introduced myself and informed him of the unpleasant experience my table was having so far, along with needing a refill and being used as a standing point for a photo-op. Jeremy apologized, replaced our appetizer with a warm one and stated that he would inform our waiter to correct the errors made. Our waiter promptly returned to ask if we needed anything but I was seriously just over it! There was clear bias with how our table was treated versus those that he assumed he would get larger tips from. As a reminder, great tips are generated from great service, but I digress. 

Thank you Jeremy for representing the level of service all Firebirds staff should be performing, unfortunately it may be a while before I visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I've visited Firebirds before but never this particular location. The ambiance is a standard setup - lights low, dark wood and well lit bar. 

I spent some time with my mom here and due to the 90 minute wait, we decided to grab a seat at the bar. Our server/bartender was Mary and she was really nice and super fast when it came time to make our drinks (after a long week, bartenders like her can become your best friend in 2.5 seconds). 

I enjoyed my favorite dish in their menu - Firebirds Chicken Pasta - it comes with thin slivers of chicken and real bacon bits in a spicy cream sauce over penne pasta. If you're indecisive on what to get, you can't go wrong with that. For two people with a few drinks included... $80. Total was not budget friendly, but neither is treating my mother (lol, don't tell her I said that). 

The only turn off with this location... is the parking. To save yourself the headache you can always valet park for $5 (don't quote me on the cost), but if you would like to park your own car then you will have to join the scavenger hunt along with the mall goers.  

No worries, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place!

 I love the rest of the menu... My wife and i travel 20 plus miles multiple times a month and have brought many people here just to get one of any different things as long as we get the worlds best sweet potato fries... are you tracking ? 

Guess what they took off the menu and replaced with tator tots !? You guessed it they killed the sweet potatoe fries !

Big companies do stupid things and this company lost a loyal customer. The deep fried greasy tots are nasty  ! 
 Bye bye ;(("}
{"text":"If you love prime ribs and seafood as much as I do, this is definitely a place to be. This restaurant is well decorated, cocktail is delicious and definitely gives out an relaxing atmosphere to hang out with friends or your love one (date night is highly recommended). 

To start off, I ordered a \"Firebird Signature Martini\" ($10). I am not a big drinker, but generally prefers fruity cocktail that is not overly sweet. This drink is delicious especially if you like pineapple flavor. The complimentary bread was still hot when it was served (best way to start off your meal on a Friday night). For appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes and came with two pieces. The dish was well decorated and goes great with the orange sauce. If you plan on ordering this dish, don't forget to pile up the veggies in the middle of the plate and eat that with it. Your taste bud would love experiencing different flavor all at the same time. 

For main entrée, I ordered a 12oz Prime Rib (medium rare). It was so juicy and tender I literally finished it within 15 minutes (or less). My friend ordered a filet mignon a side of lobster tail. They messed up the order and brought us shrimps as a side instead. We waited an additional 15 minutes to get it corrected and they were apologetic. Filet Mignon was also tender and juicy. Personally, I will still choose prime rib over it (personal preference). When the meal was finished, I was so full and simply do not have any room for dessert. 

I did see the waitress stopping by the manager to see if he could do something about the bill due to the mix up. Unfortunately, they've decided not to comp anything (perhaps throw in a free dessert?). I was not there expecting anything for free, but we were definitely shock that they did nothing. I guess they would only comp customers who throws around an attitude, screaming and yelling when the meal was wrong. Since we were being nice about the whole mixed up, we ended up getting nothing. 

Other than that, our experience here was wonderful. I'll definitely come back here for another cocktail and delicious meal with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"They have the best chicken quesadillas has down. I was not expecting that flavor explosion that happens in my mouth. Can't stop thinking about it"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here last night.  Service was great, food spectacular, no room to improve my experience.  I ravaged the delmonico and my wife loved the cilantro chicken.  Martinis were also very good.  Shared my comments with manager Corey."}
{"text":"Everyone busted their fanny to make our experience fabulous. It was!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner there last night. Our server Zach was awesome. The other server in our area was mr social and found his extended conversing loud and irritating. The food was lacking. My husband had steak which was tough, not a prime cut by any means. I had the braised tenderloin pasta which came out barely warm, beef was mushy, and peppers were completely raw. Very disappointing."}
