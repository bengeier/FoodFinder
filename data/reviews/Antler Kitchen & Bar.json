{"text":"After seeing such glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to check it out.

Went with a group and shared some appetizers and entrees - some suggestions from the reviewers and recommendations from our server.

Apps:  Duck heart yakitori, Jamaica Patty and wild boar gyoza.

Entrees:  chestnut gnocchi, rabbit pappardale and rack of deer.

My faves was the duck heart, pappardale and the rack of deer.  

Love the concept, atmosphere and the food; and definitely great place to share with friends or family.  And the portion sizes are large enough to share family style.  If you go as a group, they can even split the bill evenly.   I can't think of one bad thing to say about this restaurant except the noise level, but that's common with most new restaurant  designs. 

Thanks to Antler and a few other restos that specialize in game meat, I'm a huge fan now of farm to table style!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and even better food!!! The ambiance is warm and cozy, with great cocktails and well thought out dishes that are sure to impress. The personal touches from chef Hunter make all the difference and make you feel like you're at a friends kitchen table. Will be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"Ok, so as I've mentioned in previous reviews, I don't typically bother unless it's one of the best places I've been to or one of the worst. 

Have been looking forward to eating here since it opened and last night we finally made it around. Have to say, that almost everything was done perfectly. If we're going for an overall score, with everything in mind, I would've gone with a 4.5 star, strictly because they need to figure out their front door situation in the winter. We were about half way into the restaurant and every time the door opened there would be a freezing cold draft that would come in and chill my girlfriend and her wonderfully pregnant friend. So minus half point for that, but otherwise amazing. 

First off, they offer you a water that has been filtered through a maple tree. We never go for anything other than tap so we passed, until... our pregnant friend showed up and we figured \"hey, if she can't drink these delicious cocktails with us, why not get her fancy water\" and DAMN was it actually really amazing. It taste like maple sugar water, which may sound gross but it was actually amazing. Worth $10... debatable, but really good. If you do get it, I'd recommend having at least 4 people to split with. 

The apps: we had the boar and sweet potato gyoza... amazing, everyone enjoyed. Then split the Jamaican venison patty... even more amazing, wanted to eat like 4 of these.  

Mains: my lovely GF and her friend both had the chestnut Gnocchi and it was unbelievably tasty. My buddy and I both had the rack of deer... I cannot express in words how unbelievably good this dish was, I would've licked the plate had it been acceptable, but instead I settled for scraping it with my fork until nothing was left. Such a perfectly put together dish with amazing flavour profiles. I'm typically a rack of lamb kind of person at restaurants, and this was so much better than any rack of lamb I've had in the city. Hand down my favourite dish of the year so far and easily would rank among the top 3 for all of last year. To put this into perspective, my GF and I eat out 3 - 5+ nights a week in varying restaurants and takeout places because we both have little time to cook. 

Dessert! We weren't going to get dessert, but after a bunch of delicious cocktails and some wonderfully paired wine, we ended up ordering all 4 because everything else had been so good. Their was a \"spruce ice\" dish or something along those lines and it was the only one that was underwhelming. I think this may have been because it tasted a lot like a frozen version of the maple water that we'd been drinking, so didn't stand out as much. Still enjoyable though. The cheesecake was, by the end, the favourite. The apple tart with vanilla ice cream was also incredibly good and the chocolate brownie was also good. 

Almost forgot to mention the service! Our waitress was playful, nice and joked around with our table even though the place was busy. Was very attentive, made great recommendations and she genuinely seemed proud to be serving everything that came to our table. 

All in all, our bill wasn't cheap by any means (about $120/person after tip and only 3 of us were drinking), but it was WELL worth it and we'll certainly be going back because I'll be dreaming about that f%$#@$ rack of deer and Jamaican patty until I'm ramming it into my face once again."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Food is amazing. The ribeye was the best I have ever tasted and I have had tasted many. I used to think that ribeye steak should have the bone in, but not any more.
The Jamaican Patty was a tasty appetizer - not too spicy which allows the flavours to shine through. The yakitori with Duck Hearts took some courage as the texture is different, but if you can get past that the flavours are incredible.
My companions had the Rainbow Trout and Wild Boar Ragout and they both gave rave reviews.
All this in one of the coolest areas of town.
Don't miss this recent addition to the Toronto food scene."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Their menu is incredibly approachable. I think everybody can relate to and appreciate the menu here. Their dishes are all essentially familiar dishes but elevated with a wild twist, or \"game versions\" of classics. I think Antler is an ideal place for people who have tried and love game, as well as those trying game for the first time. My favourite dishes were the Wild Mushroom Tarte Tatin, Ricotta Cavatelli, Game Burger, Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer, and Warm Chocolate Brownie."}
{"text":"Well how do you get more Canadian than au pied de cochon (refer to last review)... you don't

But you definitely try at Antler kitchen and bar. 

When looking at the menu, you get the sense you hunted/gathered everything yourself (you didn't) because everything comes from products that are proudly Ontario/Canadian 

Venison tartare: something about raw diced deer meat makes me feel like a kid again (apologies to Bambi). Seasoning was just right, very plain and simple, letting you taste the fresh flavours of the deer. 

Rack of Venison: a damn good looking dish. Perfectly cooked on a charcoal grill but really tiny. Like I know deers have more than one rib.. give it to me already. Spice also takes away a lot of the gamey flavour of the deer, but it gives it a nice crust. Served on a bed of mash peas and braised deer shoulder, which has the same texture as pulled pork tbh

Bison ribeye: well kill me now and put me in a coffin. Hands down better than any beef ribeye Ive had in a steakhouse. Holy moly, and if you get it with the foie gras, it just adds another level of ecstasy to the dish. Very nicely salted and charred on a charcoal grill to allows for the crusty shell on the outside. And inside, perfection if asked for medium rare / or bleu

Outstanding place that gives a new meaning to our license plates that read \"Ontario: Yours to Discover\""}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at antler, everything from the décor to the food and service is amazing such a warm friendly atmosphere 
we made a reservation last minute and they were super accommodating, 
we sat at the bar and had a great time , the bartender was so helpful and all of his suggestions were excellent.. highly recommended to all! 
finally a place with a warm atmosphere, without the pretentious scene."}
{"text":"The husband and I went there for date night after hearing so many good things about it! All of the food was amazing; the wild boar gyoza was awesome and the rabbit pappardelle was even better. However the seared duck breast was tough and a little chewy. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Our group of 4 had the Charcuterie, House Smoked Mozzarella  and the Harvest Salad to start, the mozzarella and harvest salad were very similar and we regretted getting both. Of the two, we all liked the Harvest Salad better. 

For our mains two of us had the Chestnut Gnocchi and the other two had the Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer. Both of these dishes were phenomenal! SIze portions were perfect as well.

We each had a cocktail, I had The Hunter which was so good, and I was told the caesar is great too. We also ordered two bottles of wine, i did find their wine list a little underwhelming, there weren't any I that blew my mind.

We tried two desserts as well, neither was mind blowing but I'm not a huge dessert person anyways. 

In terms of service, we unfortunately had a waitress who was new and not cut out for fine dining. I won't go into detail about the many many mistakes she made and things she forgot but it was bad. Towards the end of the meal I approached the manager to let him know about our unfortunate server and he said he had noticed a lot of what she had done, he also said every table complained about this poor girl.  He was extremely apologetic and i could tell he felt awful. One of the owners was also there and come over to our table later to offer his apologies as well. They then offered to VERY generously compensate us because of the bad service we had received. As far as I know the said server no longer works there and the management really went out of their way to make up for the poor service we had received. They went above and beyond actually.  

We will definitely be going back to Antler in the future."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Myself and two others had dinner here about a month ago on a saturday evening.  The menu is creative and is definitely something that would appeal to any game meat enthusiast.  We collectivetly ordered the deer tartare, jamaican deer patty, braised rabbit parpadelle, bison steak, game burger.  The food was well prepared, though I didnt think the game burger had a flavour that differentiated it from a traditional beef burger from other restaurants. 

Our service was polite and efficient.  I will say the food is priced appropriately for the creativity and quality being served.  The atmosphere is cozy and great for small groups or pairs of diners.  

Overall i did enjoy the experience  and would return, if only to try some of the other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner at Antler. Food was really beautifully presented and tons of flavour. For a fine dining experience with big portions go here!"}
{"text":"Husband and I really enjoyed our meal and experience. Really great server who gave us excellent recs on our meal. We both loved the pork lumpia and even though I am not a huge steak person, I ordered the bison and it was fantastic. The drinks are also unique and delicious and included something for every taste!"}
{"text":"I had a perfect dinner. The service was friendly and helpful. I think it was the owner or perhaps just the manager but either way he was on top of making sure we were happy with everything. 

Drink recommendations were great. I loved the music and the decor. And the food was just fantastic. I'm still thinking about that venison shank and it's 12 hours later."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and ambiance! Only critique would be the noise level...not a lot of material in the decor to absorb the sound from other tables so, be weary of who is sitting near you. 

Would recommend making reservations if you are planning to visit on the weekend. Sat at a table near the door and watched many disappointed and hungry patrons get turned away. Even the bar was reserved. 

Jamaican Venison Patty (3.5/5)
Mushroom Tarte (5/5) HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE
Deer with crusted ash (5/5)
Burger with truffle fries (5/5)"}
{"text":"Went here on the basis of previous Yelp reviews, and because the concept looked cool.
Were not disappointed!!!
We had the Charcuterie board, game hen, and spice ash rack of deer - and everything was superb, as were the prompt and pleasant service and cocktails.

Would definitely come again and recommend!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday and the place was filled so a nice atmosphere. Service was excellent. Wine selection was very good and multiple price points. Their specialty cocktails were interesting and the same price as a glass of wine around $12-$15. The Himalayas. Did not enjoy it tasted like perfume. We shared our appetizers and mains. Food was fresh and almost all were excellent. Excellent apps were Charcuterie and Game Tourtiere. The Wild Boar Lumpia was ok. For mains the Rabbit Pappardelle and Crispy Duck were great but the Bison Rib Eye was ok. Dessert was delicious. It was $100 each but worth it. Would recommend for a group of 4 and also a romantic evening out."}
{"text":"Wild meat burger was awesome. Best burger I had in TO so far."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I initially saw this restaurant on Yelp as we were driving around and decided to try it on a Friday night. They were completely booked, but within ten minutes they had a no show and were very accommodating! We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly, catering and made some mean cocktails. We ordered a foie gras appetizer on a biscuit, it was a special and it was very good, the foie gras was cooked perfectly and the cherry compote went very well with it. I had the rack of deer, which came on a heavenly braised neck meat, which was very succulent. The deer itself was cooked a perfect medium rare. 

Definitely would come back, very lively, great atmosphere, knowledgeable staff and very passionate."}
{"text":"Antler has been open for a few weeks and what I can say that it was pretty darn good. My partner and I went late last night.  We had a reservation for 9 pm... and the restaurant was full with other diners still coming in after us.

First of all, they take reservations! Which is fantastic for a more mature crowd that refuses to wait in line for all of the new 'hipster' restaurants that don't take resos. 

The atmosphere is simple, cozy, and generally comfortable. There is ample seating at the bar and I noticed there was bar-style seating at the front window. We had a table, but if you want to have a more informal meal, the option is there.

The service was really friendly and their timing for everything was actually perfect. So, thumbs up here.

And the food! They emphasize 'foraged food' and I would have to say they did a good job.  Everything had a genuine taste to it and wasn't overly contrived, so I was able to taste the raw ingredients (and I can really appreciate that 'food honesty').

Overall, a delicious and healthier meal where we were able to leave and feel good about the experience. We paid $130, including tax/tip.

We had:

- beet salad
- wild boar gyoza. (tasty!)
- chestnut gnocchi. (lovely presentation and mixture of tastes - great dish)
- rainbow trout. (perfectly cooked with a variation of purees to savour with)
- cedar gin sour  (the hint of cedar was a nice touch)
- big rock beer

Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures at this meal, but I can assure you that it is a pleasant experience if you are looking to have a quality meal.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"The service cannot be beat. They accommodated us coming in after they had finished serving their dinner menu and never made us feel rushed. Our waitress was so lovely. We started with the wild mushroom tarte tatin and venison tartare. The tarte was so delicious. I enjoyed the venison but had a little bit of trouble with the texture. It's not the restaurant's fault - just a function of it being deer as opposed to beef. It was still flavorful, and I kept eating! We had the deer ribs as our main. We really enjoyed it - tender and flavorful! We will definitely be back here next time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is relatively small with an intake decor. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. I followed the recommended dishes. First the appetizer which had an array of very interesting items on it. The most notable was the smoked deer heart. The pates were also very good. Very nice presentation as well. The main course was a ashed deer loin on a bed of braised pulled deer neck meat and vegetables. This was an outrageously good dish. It rivalled some of the best food I have had in Europe. This dish was the absolute highlight of my trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"The bison prime rib was out of this world. The charcuterie board (something I never usually order) had unique offerings, meats cured in house, and was delectable. Also shared a trout dish with roasted sweet potato, pretty much a dish made in heaven. Ok, on to the drinks... we sat at the bar and got to watch the bar tender in action, setting fire to cedar for infusions and concocting hipster extrordinaire cocktails. He attentively listened for what we liked in a taste profile and whipped up some world class drinks. Also gave a great wine pairing recommendation for our meal.  Can't say enough about this place. Go! Order something you usually wouldn't. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had our girls night out and started our night with dinner at Antler. There were 5 of us and we sat at a table by the door. It was a little chilly when people opened the door but it's not a big deal. 

The restaurant is small and cozy with a warm vibe. We opted for the maple water instead of regular water as it was recommended by a friend. Who doesn't like antioxidants in your water?! 

Our server was friendly and prompt. We were greeted as soon as we sat down. Our drinks came quickly as well as our appetizers. I got the duck heart and it was really tasty! Others ordered some sorts of salad (boring!) and with no complaints. A few of us ordered the pappardelle with rabbit as entree and it was amazing!!! However I wish I ordered the featured duck breast...I sampled a piece of duck my girlfriend ordered and WOW! It was so juicy and flavourful.   

Their food is at a higher price point but we definitely got what we paid for. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch (their dinner menu is a little too $$ for me) and I've enjoyed myself both times. Last time I had the eggs benny with pork belly and just today I had the game burger + the egg on top and it's AMAZING. I would go so far as to say it's the best burger in Toronto for a sit-down restaurant. AND I'm not usually a burger person. 

Can't wait to come back next time!"}
{"text":"Get the game burger!!!!! Enough said. 

We came late on a Saturday night around 10pm and we had to wait for a table. We ended up sitting at the bar because the tables were very close to each other and it would've felt like we were on a triple date with strangers. 

We ordered 3 food items and beer from the late night snack menu. Venison heart peppers and wild boar corn dog were good - nothing spectacular. But the game burger was absolutely amazing. I read reviews below where a lot of people said it was the best burger they had tasted and thought they were exaggerating. I completely take that back & I actually agree with them 100%. It was so delicious and juicy - I was sad when I finished it lol

But seriously - try the game burger! Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"The burger is nice and juicy. The eggs benny looks unbelievable- the Americano was on point. I would absolutely suggest brunch here."}
{"text":"Excellent vibe, helpful staff and a very tasty menu.
Got the trout which was fantastic.  I guess I played it safe, with a menu full of game meat I chose the fish, glad I did and would probably do it again.  The real winner for me here though which is hard to say because everything is prepared so amazing was the wild boar gyoza.....This place stands out in the city due to its unique menu, worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful presentation, cozy atmosphere! Our waitress was extremely nice and genuinely helpful. Our mushroom tart, bison cavatelli and rack of deer were amazing. I was just closing my eyes and savoring every bite. The only complaint, if any, was that the cavatelli had very few pieces of bison but still VERY delicious."}
{"text":"Great cozy spot perfect for carnivores and vegetarians alike. I love the variety of game dishes which are prepared beautifully. Great cocktail and wine list with a lot of wines by the glass which is so very appreciated as I'm a wino. Love brunch their too."}
{"text":"We first heard of Antler through all the recent media attention, and it is so worth it.

We love trying new things, and locally sourced fresh ingredients is always a plus. Game may not be for everyone, but really mostly for not having tried it.

We started with the charcuterie plate and cheese tray, along with the boar lumpia (think spring roll). They had wild blueberries to go with the cheese tray (far superior to the larger farmed ones...intense flavour!! Ah, the childhood memories!).

The wine list is OK (we had a bottle from rioja), but their mixed drinks are interesting and tasty.

We had the bison steak and boar ragout, while our friends had the venison and also the bison.

For dessert we had the literally smoked mouse and the crabapple semifreddo. Both were delicious.

Service was good. It was our servers first night, and she was great. Friendly and attentive.

We will be back. Give it a try - you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Both my husband (who is vegetarian) and I loved the food!  Service was friendly and fast.  Food was delicious and innovative.  I had the duck hearts and my husband had the mushroom tart as appetizers - delectable!  He had the Chestnut gnocchi and I had the rack of deer - again both were fantastic.  We were impressed that this meat themed restaurant excelled so well with their vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"Meh.  Maybe we expected too much? Great concept but lacking in execution. We expected rich robust earthy flavours but most of the dishes seemed to be missing something. 

STARTERS: The VENISON TARTARE was tasty; a good solid starter, if a touch too much dijon. The WILD MUSHROOM TARTE TATIN was overdone (almost burnt), the phyllo pastry far too thick, and the mushrooms too dry. The FOIE GRAS was strangely stringy though the preserved cherries and spiced wine reduction was a perfect woodsy compliment and the toasted buttermilk biscuit (though too much carb for the dish) was also quite nice (but really, half the biscuit would have been more than enough).

MAINS: The PAPPARDELLE with braised rabbit was good but very mild.  The rabbit meat was tender but could easily have passed for shredded turkey. Tastiest part of the dish was the parmesan. SPICE ASH CRUSTED RACK OF DEER was delicious!! Smoky, earthy, gamey, rich venison atop pulled braised shoulder, beautifully wilted chard and velvety parsnip puree. By far the best dish of the night. Dont bother with anything else just order this one dish!

Was also a bit disappointed they didn't do anything special for VDay.. Felt like just any old night out."}
{"text":"4.5/5

Everything is delicious. Staff are friendly and helpful. Cute place to go if you enjoy wild game. 

Only knock is that they'd offer more local/Cdn wines and esp so by the glass in line with the theme.

Make a reservation. And use Dinr to find last minute availability."}
{"text":"Flavorful meat with excellent service. Try sitting in the Chef's Table. Will visit again in no time."}
{"text":"I think this could be a good place to go if you are local and can go frequently or are a friend of the chef, as the quality of the service is not consistent- to the point where the chef actually sat in my husband's chair, while he was in the bathroom, to talk to his friend at the table next to us with zero acknowledgement to me!  Food was interesting but with the exception of the slow cooked venison in the mac & cheese generally unexceptional. Maybe I've been spoiled with prior game meat meals and farm-to- table restaurants but I'd say Antler is definitely only average."}
{"text":"I would call this 'forest to table' eating.  The meats are gamingly deliciousness (Yes, I make up words when I get excited about chomping on good food). On my visit I got:

1. venison patty - think gourmet Jamaican patty with a pie-like crust served with a spicy sriracha tasting dipping sauce 
2. venison tartar - very good but nothing extraordinary
3. braised rabbit pappardelle - so delicious and highly recommended,  pairs well with the main course meat plates
4. Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer - the chef's signature dish. It's served with braised neck,
 parsnip purée (so yummy), and swiss chard

Best cocktail on the menu and one of the best in the city - the Smoked Barrel! Scotch (yess!) chocolate bitter (sweet!) maple syrup (Canadian eh?!) and the best part - a cinnamon smoked glass (fancy!)

If going as a pair I highly recommend reserving the chef's table - it is the only seats that looks right into the kitchen and they often give you extra goodies to sample."}
{"text":"I went for brunch with my brother last weekend and am STILL thinking about it. Definitely in my top three brunch spots now. I ordered the French toast and he got the eggs Benny. Both were really fantastic. The eggs were perfectly cooked and I couldn't help but steal a few bites. French toast was perfectly cooked and the blueberry compote was a nice addition. Staff were friendly and service was great. Prices are a little higher than your average brunch ($17 for Benny, $14 for FT) - but I'm happy to pay this for a good meal with good ingredients. Annnnnnnnd they take reservations  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The deer and rib eye entrees were superb. Cocktail list was fun, and the wine was well paired by the sommelier Steven. The staff were friendly and cheerful.  Recommend to anyone looking for a quality meal in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"So many great choices, a fantastic menu with many options.  Halibut & risotto were spectacular, as was my venison rack.  Custom stout was also delicious; special thanks to our server for providing my mother with a special \"grandma\" serving of stout.  My only constructive feedback is that I wish their pasta portions were larger, they're so good!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant 3x and it has become one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The service is great and that charcuterie board is to die for. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Antler yesterday last minute for a celebration. We called for a reservation, and they only had a window seat (kind of bar seating) or the bar. We opted for the window, but they moved us to a regular table soon after another couple finished up so that was nice. I was a little disappointed as the menu on their website had several veggie mains, but at the restaurant the menu only had one. So instead I opted for the soup and a salad and my husband got the cavatelli with boar ragu. The soup was AWESOME, stinging nettles and fennel. The salad was good, but the soup was definitely the best. My husband really enjoyed his pasta, but definitely stated that the portion size was too small for almost $30. It was overall good, but what really brought things down was that when the bill came we were charged for water! I'm sorry, if you're going to charge for water, you should let people know - it's not Europe."}
{"text":"Excellent from the service to the food. Relaxed casual ambience. Toronto needs more restaurants like this one! The rack of deer and the mushroom tarte tatin are top notch."}
{"text":"My husband and I came on a Sunday and sat at the bar. Service was excellent. The food was mouth watering! We would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

Had a great experience dining at the chefs table. Kitchen staff worked very well together and were efficient despite the small space they had to deal with.

A favourite dish of mine was the braised rabbit pappardelle. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce married well with the rest of the ingredients.

Dishes were well thought out and executed with finesse."}
{"text":"I've been here THREE times - twice for dinner (July 2016, July 2017) and once for brunch (December 2016) - and Antler Kitchen & Bar has never disappointed me. 

I love Canadian cuisine, especially Antler's Canadian cuisine. I love the foraged concept, the wild meats, the regional ingredients. I really love the decor of the restaurant. It's small, which goes well with the theme and the exposed brick walls. It's all a very wild concept and I can't get enough of it. I follow Chef Michael Hunter on Twitter, on Instagram. I follow the restaurant on Twitter, Instagram, and I think even Facebook. 

Yeah, so if you see KELLLSIFY liking things on Instagram and Twitter, and I don't know, Facebook, THAT'S MEEEE. 

Here are all the items I've ever ordered:
1. The Seasonal Soup (I don't remember what it was called, but it was tasty!)
2. Charcoal Grilled Yakitori - Chicken Thigh, Wild Mushroom, and Duck Heart
3. Pappardelle (First time I tried rabbit!)
4. Roasted Duck Breast (I love duck, it's probably my favorite protein, but damn, that butternut squash pure is something else)
5. Eggs Benedict - Pork Belly
6. Foraged Cedar Infused Ice
7. Some sort of cheesecake, it had pistachios and berries I think (Off menu as of July 2017)
8. Maple Toffee Pudding (WOWOWO THE BEST. My BF loves ginger ice cream and the wild ginger ice cream got him wild. I will never eat ginger ice cream the same at any AYCE sushi joint now).
9. The Himalayas Cocktail (Pink and tastes sweet and delicious) 

Attention: You must try the Maple Toffee Pudding. 

I've ALSO tried bits and pieces of their Game Burger and their roasted deer during Taste of Toronto.  

Everything I've mentioned tastes like 100%. (The Maple Toffee Pudding maybe 100.1%.) I personally would choose the Duck Breast for you, but I think they're most known for their Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer.

And because yours annoying truly takes pictures of almost all the foods she eats, I've uploaded pictures of most of the items I've listed above. 

I will try my best to eat all the items in Antler during my life here in Toronto. 

Of course, no restaurant is perfect. 

Some things to consider:
1. $$$$$$$$. If you want to enjoy a drink, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert, you're looking at an upwards of $50 for sure. The last time I came here, the bill came out to be around $110 in total for me and my boyfriend combined. 
2. Make reservations ahead of time because the restaurant has limited table space. The first time I came here, my friend and I got seated at the bar. The second time, I got seated at the bar-like tables facing the windows. I asked really politely the third time, and they gave me a table. (I almost got stuck at the bar again.) 

If you keep those two things in mind, you're bound to have a FRUITFUL time and meal. 

TLDR; COME EAT HERE. TRY OUT WILD FOODS."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best meals I've had in Toronto in a long time.

My one complaint that if you had been to (and loved, like I did) the long gone \"This End Up\", which occupied the same space, you feel like you're dining in a ghost: the decor is almost identical, the layout the same, the only difference is a few (not surprising) antlers hanging from the wall.  

They would do with up dating the decor to match the price point and food quality.  This could be a really great romantic dinner spot, but it sort of feels like a casual neighbourhood spot, versus a destination to go west from downtown.  

Now, onto what was great.  The food.  OMG the food.  We had venison patties, wild boar gyozas, and the mushroom torte to start.  All three were amazing, but WAY too much food.  I had informed our server (who I loved, by the way) Ely that we wanted guidance if what we ordered was not the wisest choice.  It would have done him good to let us know that's way too much food you will not want to keep eating. In retrospect, despite being delicious, I think we would have been fine with the torte and the patty, although they have a similar flaky crust.  My dining companion liked the patty the best, but that mushroom torte....even though Antler is a game meat restaurant, this vegetarian beauty was just perfection.  I adored it.

We brought our own bottle of wine (corkage is $25) so I can't speak to their cocktails.

For our second/main course, we had the deer and the rabbit pasta.  Oh, how I wish I had been hungrier - that deer.  That entire dish.  It was amazing.  Cooked perfection, the kind of dish that's improved by picking up every taste/sauce on the plate.  The pasta was also delicious, just the right amount of toughness and pasta to meat ratio.  I'm drooling writing this.

And then, of course, we had the cedar ice to finish which was also the best amount of palate cleanser your stomach could hold at that point.

I really can't rave about this place enough.  Go.  Go before it gets so busy you'll never get to go.  Go for your birthday, your anniversary, or just a random beautiful night.  (PS I saw a lot of other people eating different dishes than us, and the ribeye and the burger both looked stellar)"}
{"text":"The food at Antler is amazing and I love that the meat is all naturally raised (meaning no hormones or antibiotics!) They have managed to take unconventional ingredients (game meats) and transform them into delicious dishes that will please any palate. The service is friendly but not exceptionally fast. The atmosphere was pleasant. Not too loud, not too cramped, but it was a tad hot in there. 

I made a  reservation a week in advance with Bookenda and was seated at the bar. I was surprised they'd seat us there as most places use the bar seating for walk ins,  but they explained they book every seat in the restaurant-- be aware of this if you are hoping for a table. You may want to call them to book. 

We had: 
Foraged mushroom and caramelized onion tart - 5/5 this is heavenly. The mushrooms are so delicious. It's quite rich so I recommend sharing this dish. 

Spicy Venison patty - 3/5 This was good, but to me it just tasted like any curried meat. I wanted to try it, but I don't think I would order it again.

Ash crusted deer - 5/5 I've never had deer meat, but was a bit wary because I am not a fan of moose meat. This dish however is fantastic. The deer is not at all \"gamey\" or strong flavoured. The texture was tender. I loved the root vegetables it came with. 

Cornish hen - 5/5 OMG this was fantastic. The chicken was so succulent. Perfection! 

We were too full for desert. 

I recommend Antler!"}
{"text":"Only took me a couple years but I finally made it. To say I was excited for my first Antler experience would be an understatement. I was counting down the days for this moment. 

Antler's received quite a bit of publicity (or notoriety, depending on whom you ask) in the past few weeks so I was half expecting some craziness. Thankfully, the meal was the only thing that had my attention all night... and maybe my friends. 

I walked in for my 8pm reservation and was promptly greeted my one of the staff. It's a fairly narrow space with no host stand but the staff do keep an eye on the front door to make sure no one is waiting. The place was completely booked up for the night. 

They have a fairly straightforward menu with meat, veg and vegan options. Our table opted for apps to share - foie gras with house made biscuit, large charcuterie board which included some really unique cured meats and pâté, and game tourtière which was a mix of deer, duck and wild boar.  The tourtière was probably my fav, really good flavours and buttery crust. We scrapped every last bit of that off. Seriously. 

For mains everyone chose something different. I opted for the venison. It's was a mid-rare filet on top of a ragout with parsnip purée. The filet was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. I will say that if you're a bigger meat eater then the bison might be more up your alley. The burger looked really good too and much bigger portion than what the pictures make it out to seem.  I honestly don't think you could do wrong ordering any of their entrees. 

All in all I had a really great experience here and now I've got my eye on that Antler brunch so I hope to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The second I walked in everyone made me feel very welcomed! I started off with the beet salad which was absolutely delicious! I had the game burger for an entree which has wild boar, venison and bison. That was one of the best burgers I have ever had! It was so juicy and tender! For dessert I had a strawberry tart which was a great ending to a fabulous dinner!"}
{"text":"So unique. So yummy. Worth your money. Expect to spend 250$ for 2 all courses tax and tip.

A thousand percent worth it. Super memorable food."}
{"text":"I'd known of Antler for some time, but finally reached the tipping of finally going due to the publicity of the anti-meat protesters. Apparently protesters like the weekend off too, since none were to be found when I came, but for the staff at Antler - it was very much an ideal Saturday evening due to a packed restaurant.

I'm very comfortable and happy to share plates whenever I can, so I was happy to be with a group and split appetizers and entrees as well. The appetizers ordered were: foie gras, charcuterie board and the pheasant pot pie. Based off of these - the former two in particular, I would say there is more emphasis on the experience of taste rather than being filled up in regards to their appetizers. The foie gras made sense given the richness of it - and I loved it's pairing with the cherries; and though I enjoyed the charcuterie board, I found it a little sparse in terms of quantity. The pot pie was really enjoyable and I appreciated enjoyed the taste of the fennel in particular.

If the appetizers were a bit on the lighter side, the entrees ensured that you wouldn't leave hungry - all the while have wonderful taste and prepared with great technique. I split the Bison Rib Eye and the Game Burger with someone else. Though the rib eye was the highest priced item on the menu at $45, it was still more than a fair price for a very large plate. The rib eye struck a perfect balance of the unique taste of bison without veering into being too gamey. The polenta was near perfect, and it didn't even feel as though I was splitting the greens and mushrooms since there was a such a great quantity. The red wine jus that had soaked into the veggies made them nice and savoury and ensured that eating veggies was certainly not a chore.

The game burger was very enjoyable, and I would even say surprisingly good value at $19 considering the patty was large and made from a blend of bison, deer and and boar. Naturally, you couldn't pick out a particular meat, but they combined to make a great taste and it was surprisingly juicy for a patty that consisted of wild game.

It was a great experience overall, and a nice balance of appreciating finer tastes along with having a hearty meal. Good value for your money, and I'd certainly recommend going as a group and sharing in order to try as much of the menu as possible."}
{"text":"One time for Yelp guiding me to this hidden treasure. We were leaving Caribana and looking for a great meal to finish the night. Everything in the nearby vicinity of Lake Shore was jam packed with crowds leaving. That's when we realized we needed to get away from the area. A quick look at the photos of food from Antler and I was sold.

The street that it sits on is not a restaurant hotspot. It looked like the typical local neighborhood, with dry cleaners and fast food. Inside was another story. Great atmosphere, dim lighting, and early 90s-mid 2000 hip hop/r&b playing. That's all I could hope for. Then the hostess asked if we had reservations and we were instantly deflated. Luckily there was space at the bar and we were seated immediately.

The bartender (who made a perfect old
-fashioned and instantly gained all credibility) walked us through the menu and his favorite selections. Most of his choices aligned with ours and was affirmation of our yelp photo scanning skills. We decided to share plates and  the Wild Boar Gyoza (pot stickers for us less cultured folks) were a nice starter. I preferred them without the accompanying soy sauce, so the flavor isn't drowned. Next we had the pappardelle pasta with rabbit and apricots. Oh my...I wasn't ready. I should have been prepared for how good this tastes but I wasn't. I blame myself for years of ordering pasta with red sauce. We finished off the food order with the Bison flank steak and frites. And by finished I mean I wasn't hungry but I still finished because it was that dang good. 

If you have the chance, you owe it to yourself to get here. I'll be back the next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Ended up here after a long day exploring the city. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more attentive and we were offered several recommendations. The cocktails are both interesting and equally tasty. I enjoyed the Blood Fashioned and also got to taste the Kordonis, which I never would have ordered, but ended up being quite good. 

We then tried the Gyoza, which was delicious, as it was pan fried, rather than deep fried.

I had the chestnut gnocchi for my main dish and this proved to be the highlight of my meal. An excellent combination of ingredients made each bite worth savoring. Great blend of different vegetables and cheese. 

Finally, we opted for dessert, which was the correct choice. The chocolate brownie/mousse combo was not over sweet nor too rich. A perfect end to a really great meal. 

Atmosphere was great for dinner, and the restaurant was full but not over-crowded. Music was right up my alley (R&B with some other classics mixed in).

I hope these guys keep working on their craft and look forward to a return the next time we are in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here twice & enjoyed it both times. The duck is a beautiful dish - so tasty and tender. the duck heart yakitori is a must try! Their pastas are so flavorful as well!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, and fantastic Venison. Tried the Venison Tartar, the Jamaican Patty, and the rack of Deer. They like serving things family style, so feel free to split starters and mains and try something new. 

I sampled the mushroom tart, which was hearty and tasty, and the stinging nettle soup, which was delicate and satisfying. Honestly, nothing matched the Venison Patty though, the kick of spice in that delicately stewed meat was fantastic. The Venison Tartar was exquisitely tender and flavourful. Definitely worth trying out if you are ok with raw meat. 

For a knock your socks off main, the rack of Deer features two chops sitting on a stew of braised deer shoulder. What a great way to taste two different styles/cuts. Have no fear, this meat is not at all gamey, it's tender and tasty. 

I tried the fish and the burger, but neither held a candle to the deer. This is a place to drink some stiff cocktails, red wine and eat some fantastic game meat. I'd honestly overlook the safer options. This is a place to take a risk at. 

FYI the place is tiny so reservations are a must. The atmosphere is laid back, and not too fussy. Prices match the quality."}
{"text":"Honestly the only reason we went here was because of all the vegan whining and protesting about this place. I really don't care if somebody wants to be a vegan, let them eat what they want. But when they try to force others to not eat somewhere just because of what they serve, then I have a problem with it. 

We managed to get a reservation which was good because it was filling up fast and I have to say that it's good. We had the charcuterie plate and split the wild mushroom tart. Delicious. 

I had the bison and she had the trout. Both dishes were done very well and yes, they are a bit on the pricey side but every so often it's not a big deal.

Service was great. The atmosphere was good and all in all there were no issues with the food, the service or the restaurant itself. 

We'll definitely be back at some point. So I'd like to say thank you to all the vegans that protested this place. It tuned us into this great little restaurant that we will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Mmm, this next dish was where I was definitely impressed -- the Ricotta Cavatelli with Wild Boar Ragu was surprisingly so delicious and tasted amazing!!!  The pasta was handmade and there was tomato braised wild boar, Parmesan, and basil.  The Parmesan cheese was the key ingredient that absolutely made the dish and tied everything together.  I am a huge cheese lover and this was the epitome of perfect cheesy goodness with delicious handmade pasta and bits of tomato infused wild boar!"}
{"text":"All of the vegan publicity made me seek this place out. Was a bit of a wait for a reservation. Had to sit at the bar. Protests were apparently good for business. 
Enjoyed the charcuterie plate and bison rib eye. Food was great and the server was very pleasant. Not cheap. Dinner for two with a nice wine and a couple of cocktails came to $300 with tip."}
{"text":"Came here for a late birthday dinner on a Saturday night. We reserved for 7:15PM but arrived at 7. Luckily they were able to accomodate us. However, they reserved seats at the BAR for us .... Which was odd considering the restaurant was only around half full with regular tables available. Those were later given to walk-in customers. It wasnt too big of a deal though but I'd recommend to be specific about where you would like to sit or else they will just place you at the bar. 

I was excited to try the unique meats that Antler served as it would be my first time trying deer and bison and such. We ordered wild boar fried gyoza ($11), venison tartare ($18), rack of deer ($44), and the bison flank steak ($30). 

Everything tasted awesome, the gyoza was yummy and didnt actually have a game-y taste, it basically tasted like pork. The tartare was awesome! Delicious and nicely mixed with the raw egg. 

As for the mains, the deer did taste a bit different but still similar to beef. It had more a chalky texture, similar to liver if that makes sense. The green paste underneath the meat tasted really flavourful and unique, Im still not sure exactly what it was but Im glad i tried it! I sort of wish there was more meat in the portion, especially compared to the bison which had a lot more meat but costs significantly less. 

The bison was my partner's dish but I managed to get a taste of it and it was cooked to perfection and of course, very very similar to beef but still a nice change in cuisine! 

We also got the antler sangria ($8) and another cocktail for i think $15. I can't remember the name but it was quite fruity and had japanese liquer in it. 

We also tried the cedar shaved ice with blueberry for dessert which was a very unique taste. It reminds me of an air freshener haha but not in an unpleasant way. I'd say to give this a try! 

Overall, a quaint restaurant serving unique cusine in Parkdale with attentive, friendly staff. Great for a date night or an experience to try some unique cuts of meat."}
{"text":"Antler is a restaurant that specializes in game meat. If you do not like game meat, you will not like Antler. It's also not a restaurant for vegetarians.  If you enjoy game meat, then Antler is a great restaurant for you to try.  

We tried the boar ragu which came with tomato braised wild boar, parmesan and basil ($26). It was delicious. The cavatelli was fresh and cooked well (al dente) and paired well with the boar meat.  We also tried the roasted duck breast ($35) which was cooked medium rare to perfection. 

The service was attentive. The atmosphere was modern with a touch of rustic vibe. The prices are a bit high for the portions. The prices charged seemed like prices that one would expect of a restaurant in the financial district. 

Overall, I would recommend Antler if you enjoy game meat and / or Nouveau Canadian cuisine."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night w/ my bf! The staff were very nice and courteous. The restaurant is casual and cozy but gets VERY noisy. We ordered the boar dumplings, spice ash crusted rack of deer and the bison flank steak. Dumplings were delicious. Deer and bison were cooked perfectly but lacked a bit of flavor. Portions were very small as well and the sides weren't adequate, also quite an expensive meal! Worth a visit for the exotic meats if you're willing to pay a lot!"}
{"text":"Small and intimate locale with some good eats (and some misses). My bf and I came based on a friend's recommendation. 

For appetizers, we got the wild mushroom torte and the wild boar spring rolls. We wouldn't normally get that much before the entrees but I was starving that night and just couldn't wait! The torte was a bit bland - I think it would have fared better with some sort of sauce accompaniment. And the spring rolls were a bit burnt. I think the issue was that their spring roll making technique was off.  It was made too loose, causing the filling to be exposed to the hot oil, resulting in it being oily and slightly burnt on the ends. 

The saving grace were the entrees. I ordered the Cornish Hen, which was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, and paired well with the roasted heirloom carrots, bitter greens, roasted potatoes, and roasted onion jus. The bf ordered the pappardelle, with braised rabbit, buttered leeks, apricot preserve, parmesan cheese, and sautéed greens. 

All in all, based on my one time experience, if I were to come back, I'd probably opt for the entrees and pass on the appetizers."}
{"text":"Had the trout and the risotto and was so disappointed. It was super dry and just not tasty, over done w the salt..Not worth even the one star"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here! From cocktails through dessert, everything was top notch. 

The ingredients for each dish are carefully planned and it really shows. My favorite was the Chestnut Gnocchi, but other highlights were the Gyoza appetizer, the Smoked Mozzarella, and Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer.

The service is friendly, attentive and had great timing. The house sommelier was helpful in making a decision on what wine to pair the deer with too. The atmosphere here is cozy - we were able to talk and enjoy each other's company, just the right amount of \"busy\". We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You can thank the protestors for our wonderful meal. The Bison Rib Eye was easily a top 5 meal in my life, and that is saying something because I have been to some fantastic establishments. The restaurant is small but it has a really good vibe inside. The service was top notch and I would recommend to any travellers in the area."}
{"text":"Borderline 3.5-4/5 
Thanks to the protestors for introducing us to this restaurant. I thought the food was pretty decent and the service was great. The venison and the beet salad were my favs but a bit disappointed with the pheasant pot pie."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday afternoon for brunch with 3 friends. It's a small space with a cozy, warm atmosphere. I really liked some of the wall decorations (such as the antlers; how fitting). There were a couple of other tables in the restaurant but lots of open space. 

Our server was extremely friendly and accommodating, so props to her. The food didn't take too long either which is always a bonus when you're starving. 

There are about 6-7 options on the brunch menu. My friends opted for the Eggs Benedict and I got the Omelette with cheese, mushrooms and caramelized onions. I also added pork belly bacon.

Honestly, I wasn't crazy about the brunch and neither were my friends. It was expensive ($17+$4 for the bacon) and I feel there are much better, cheaper brunch options in the city. The omelette was good, but very rich (too rich for me at breakfast) and a little greasy. The potatoes were delicious. The bread that came with the brunch looked homemade and was phenomenal. None of us really liked the pork belly bacon. 

The service was great and it is a cute venue - so I would be open to trying Antler out at dinnertime. I feel it is more a dinner place than a brunch place based off other people's YELP dinner-time reviews."}
{"text":"The co owner is a legend, he was preparing meat in front of people protesting killing animals, you sir deserved my respect"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Food and service is amazing!  Ambiance is perfect for the theme.  You have to get the wild mushroom tarte tatin and rack of deer.  One of the best meals I've had in a while.  Go here!!!"}
{"text":"Brunch like whoa.
Had the pork belly breakfast sandwich ($8) and absolutely loved it.
The homefries ($5) were well cooked and even the crispy dried up bits were still delicious.
Even a simple order of the toast w/ blueberry compote ($4) took me to next level flavour experiences. 

Seriously can't believe I slept on this place as long as I did, it's a new favourite."}
{"text":"We visited Antler in January for the first time, having stumbled upon it accidentally. We were lucky enough to get a seat and are so thankful we did.  This was our second trip, as we live in the States and can't get back more frequently, and both times the dining experience has been 5 star.  From the vibrant atmosphere, to the friendly service to the out of this world flavor of each bite served to us, Antler is everything you could ask for.  Over our 2 trips we have enjoyed the Wild Boar Gyoza, Foie Gras, Venison Tartare, Wild Boar Cavatelli, Spiced Ash Rack of Deer, Cedar Infused Ice (truly an experience) and the Smoked Chocolate dessert.  With every bite of each dish our eyes rolled in the back of our heads.  We also had the same staff both trips - Eddie is a ROCKSTAR! He remembered us, what we ordered, where we sat, just an all around incredible addition to their staff.  He made us feel like regulars!"}
{"text":"Nice novel place to try but don't know if I will return. The burger did not live up to expectations and our other meal was not made as specified. It was pretty much completely raw instead of medium."}
{"text":"This restaurant I highly recommend. A must visit and experience the great food, atmosphere and service. Have tried all appetizers, 3 of the pasta dishes, 3 mains. Was not disappointed. Every dishes had wonderful favours.  Will go back and bring more of my friends and family. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner! Once on a Sunday night and the restaurant was fairly full and on a Tuesday night which only a few tables were full and you could probably walk in without a reservation. 

For appetizers I had the cheese and charcuterie board. Good selection of both, the cheeses were quite mild including the blue but the blueberry compote was perfectly sweet. There was some interesting gamey meats, the tongue was very tender and rarely seen on charcuterie boards. 

The Heirloom Tomato Tarte Tatin was good, the tomatoes were fresh but the pastry was slightly soggy and i wish it was crisper. The Jamaican Venison Patty could be passed, wasn't outstanding. The Venison Tartare was good, not much different from a regular beef tartare but maybe even better because there's a stronger meaty flavour to it and it comes with lots of grainy mustard. 

The Spice Ash Crusted Prime Cut of Deer - OMG this was amazing! if you are going to get anything on the menu this is the THING TO GET! The night I went it was the rack cut. It was so tender, not chewy at all, perfectly cooked, juicy inside nice smokey crust on the outside and it comes with 2 slices. 

The braised rabbit Pappardelle - AGAIN SO GOOD! definitely my second recommendation, it was so satisfying, thick handmade noodles with great chewy texture, umami savory sauce, soft rabbit with just a little bit of bitterness from the greens . My god im drooling just thinking about it. 

Bison Rib Eye - Meaty deliciousness, again perfectly cooked but it was a little bit tougher than the deer. And unfortunately the Bison Flank Steak was quite tough and dryer compared to the other meats. 

The sticky toffee pudding dessert was good, it's served warm with a scoop of ice cream. The ceder infused ice was refreshing and tasted like nothing else! it didn't taste like a tree it was slightly sweet and comes with the same blueberry compote as the cheese board. And the star, the chocolate mousse! Once they start bringing it out everyone gets intrigued. It comes with a dome filled with smoke, and when the server opens it the smoke puffs out, its quite a visual experience. The mousse itself was dark and the crunchy caramel added a bitterness, good dessert for someone looking for something not that sweet. 

Service is always great, friendly and they explain the menu well. There is a $3 charge per person for water though. It's not the cheapest, but very much worth it!"}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot - worth the trek out west (and in sub-30 degree weather at that!). This resto looks small from the outside but it's a rather long space with trendy decor (ie exposed brick, wood finishing). 

Our table of 3 tried the burger, the eggs benedict with pork belly, the foragers omelette and french toast. First comment? WOW, such generous portions!

I had the game burger and it was stellar - tender, juicy, flavourful! It was paired very nicely with the house-made bun. I went with fries on the side... no regrets! 

I look forward to returning to Antler for dinner!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch. And that is exactly what we got.

I had the Eggs Benedict with the pork belly and side salad. All in all - pretty damn good. The only negative comment I can muster is that the pork belly was a little too crispy for my liking, but even that's me being very picky. The EB was cooked to perfection and I enjoyed every savoury bite.

Also, I'd like to mention that brunch isn't all that expensive. Don't be turned off by the dreaded \"$$$$\" rating that you see up there. For 25 bucks, you can eat like a king (between the hours of 11:00am and 3:00pm, of course). If you're around the Little Portugal area, I'd definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in a while in Toronto. The service was exceptional and the food presentation was great! I got the Rack of Deer, the meat was tender and melted in the mouth. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a delicious meal. We got a last minute reservation on DINR and ended up being seated at the Chef's Table, which you otherwise have to call and make a specific reservation for. It is a high-top table that faces the kitchen. This was my first time doing this at a restaurant and I was impressed at how masterful everyone was at their craft. It was quiet yet intense and efficient, like a well-oiled machine. The chef also slipped us a free taster dessert :D

Now onto the food. We got several starters including the house made bread and charcuterie. No need to order the extra pate with the bread, because the charcuterie also comes with pate. These were both so delicious but their bread serving is VERY GENEROUS so realistically you could probably just get one of these. 

We got a skewer of the duck hearts but I didn't love them - a bit thrown off by the unusual texture. I much preferred the smoked duck hearts that were offered with the charcuterie. Surprisingly my favourite dish of the night was the pheasant pot pie - a warm hearty ramekin of comfort food. So good. I also loveeeed the rabbit papperdelle. The venison steak was delicious and tender. 

I didn't love their semifreddo dessert - choose the smoked chocolate mousse instead. 

Overall I loved this meal and would definitely go back. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Great food with a cool Canadian theme of forest to table fare. Presentation was excellent. We started with the Charcuterie platter and artisanal cheese. For mains we had braised rabbit pappardelle, spice ash crusted deer, game burger and cod. All were very good. Service was very good. The only downside was their A/C is not enough / a few fans did nothing but push around hot air.  It was around 25 Celsius (80 degrees) inside which is unacceptable for a restaurant at 8:00 at night. We won't be back unless they fix this."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! If you like gamey meat then you need to come here ASAP. It's a small place with nice, simple decor. Named one of the best new restaurants in Toronto in 2016 and definitely deserving of that title."}
{"text":"This is a place for having semi-exotic meats. You've got your selection of rabbit, duck, boar, deer, and more. The waiters are friendly people and not in a rush. Also, this is one of the few places I've been to where many people wear business suits for dinner."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Co owner Jodi made sure we had all we needed to enjoy a great meal.  The service staff are friendly and always up to chatting. No pushy meal service here.  

Our snacks consisted of charcuterie board with beef tongue, deer heart, sausage, duck pate and fois gras.  We also had the wild mushroom tarte Tatin and venison tartare to start our appetites.  

Our mains were their popular spice ash crusted rack of deer, roasted duck breast and Ricotta Cavatelli with Wild Boar Ragu.  The pasta plate was a little light on meat and the serving was on the light side as well; Otherwise a tasty dish. 

Overall though, we definitely recommend Antler for their amazing skills with meats and rustic sides.    We will be back for another taste !"}
{"text":"The co-owner and chef is a legend for the way he dealt with the vegans protesting his restaurant. They wanted to complain and call the cops.....well how bout you don't interrupt a man's place of business and livelihood"}
{"text":"3.5. Antler is a unique restaurant focusing on 'locally foraged' ingredients and specializes in some rare meats. The vibes are great and staff very nice and attentive.

We started off with the Fior do Latte salad. The cheese was a little bland, but the olives were terrific. Very fresh salad and great way to start the meal. 

For the main course, we got the Rack of Deer and Duck Breast. The deer was pretty good, the first piece was really juicy and tender but the second turned out to be a bit too dry. The dish was quite salty but paired well with the sweet carrot/turnip purée. 

Overall I think the dishes were good, but not amazing. I would come back to try the Game Burger though, which looked and sounded amazing."}
{"text":"It's hard to exaggerate just how amazing this restaurant is...a few comments:

1. Virtually every dish on the dinner menu is just plain delicious. The pastas (wild board ragu, rabbit pappardelle) are spectacular. The Rack of Deer and Bison Ribeye are the stuff of every meat-lover's fantasy. And the appetizers alone are addictive enough for me to drag friends in off the street, just to have a taste (wild boar gyoza, venison tartar, and charcuterie are MUSTS). Those who love wild game should also try the Game Burger.

2. Cocktails are high quality; carefully prepared, by bartenders that know their craft and take it seriously. The quality of cocktail here is on par with places like Barchef or Toronto Temperance Society.

3. Meals are *always* brought out fresh. This is a pet peeve of mine with many fine dining spots; they often leave meals sitting in the kitchen for far too long and by the time it reaches your table, the temperature is no longer optimal and quality of food suffers.  Antler *never* makes this mistake. The wild board gyoza, for example, is brought out almost immediately after it's been prepared; you generally have to wait a bit for to bite in. Same with the pastas.

4. Service is world class. Always.

5. Consistency.  This is perhaps the hardest thing for any restaurant to achieve; I've noticed that even the most expensive spots in the city (eg. Jacobs, George, etc) will have 'off nights'. That's just never the case at Antler. I've visited at least a dozen times, on different nights of the week. Sometimes the restaurant is packed, sometimes not. But no matter how busy, the quality of food and service is consistently great.

Some spots are so great that you just leave feeling guilty for not having tipped enough.  This place is one of those; a gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"I heard about this place because some idiots were protesting something so we decided to come check it out.  It great!  They say meat it murder, well maybe it is... tasty, tasty murder..."}
{"text":"I am not an innards kind of girl. I avoid eating hearts, livers basically anything that taste bloody or gamey. But man, the way they prepared each dish, you can't event tell they are organs. The deer heart was smoked to perfection, you can't even taste the minerals. Beef tongue paired so well with the toasted bread, yakitori skewers were so flavourful! 

Stand outs were the mushroom risotto and the wild boar spring rolls. The desserts were whimsical,  cedar flavoured ice was so refreshing and the presentation on the smoked chocolate mousse was out of this world! Everything was tasty, bold and flavourful. Service was amazing! Claire was incredibly personable, witty and knowledgeable. It was a fun and enjoyable experience. Thanks Chef Michael"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place in the heart of Toronto. The manager greeted us right away and sat us at the bar while our table was being prepared. We showed up half an hour early to our reservation at 9 on a Sunday night. The bartender was quick to serve us with our drinks, and 10-15 minutes later we were moved to our table. We ordered the \"Our Own Bread\" and tartar for appetizer. The bread basket comes with 4 pieces; 2 white and 2 sourdough, with a jar of delicious light patè and very creamy (& yummy) maple butter. The tartar was also served with four pieces of bread, and it tasted fresh and tender. I ordered the game burger, made up of bison, deer, and boar game meat, with cheddar cheese and fries. It was full of flavour and sauce. The patty was dense and thick, with fresh tomato and cheddar cheese grilled with the bun. The fries were crispy and light. 

Although we had to wait a bit longer than usual for our meals, our experience was wonderful. Our server was quick and nice, and made great food and drinks suggestion. Overall would definitely come here again. 

TLDR; delicious meal for a carnivores date!"}
{"text":"WOW!! One of the best experiences we have had in a while . Sat at the bar and Bobby (incredibly knowledgeable about spirits) took great car of us. The cocktails were wonderful, and they have a nice selection of \"barrel aged\" drinks; had the Boulevardier and it was the best I have ever had. We split the tartare, fois gras (melt in your mouth good) and a meat pie...each bit was food porn...truly cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Great service and food quality. Always excellent. Delivers great food. Meat paradise. Amazing cocktails. Elk is the way to go when available! Their burger is also an incredible dish as well as their pastas."}
{"text":"If you want food that feeds the soul, Antler is where it's at! It's a cool bar/resto with a fun vibe. They specialize in gamey meats so be prepared to indulge in some tasty protein! The venison tartare and wild boar gyoza were finely balanced. Be sure to ask for their in-house hot sauce to kick it up a notch. Also, the bison ribeye and the wild boar burger were super juicy! There aren't that many tables so reservations are recommended. Prepare for a feast and enjoy every bite."}
{"text":"Visited this place last night for my husband's birthday dinner. Had made the reservation in advance and thank god I did that because the restaurant was crazy busy.
Service was great!! Our waitress was a very friendly and gave us suggestions about what we should try from their menu.
Their menu is great and has all the different kinds of meats you can try like Venison, Wild Boar, Bison, Rabbit etc which are very rare to find in other restaurants and the prices are not crazy high. They have a couple dishes on their menu which are $40 and above but that's alright because you are getting to eat venison for that price.
We started with a charcuterie board and got five meat. yumm!!
For the mains my husband ordered Bison Rib Eye and I ordered Pappardale. Both the dishes were delicious. 
Bison Rib Eye was cooked perfectly to medium rare as asked by my husband in creamy polenta sauce, foraged mushrooms and red wine jus. He really enjoyed the dish and I am glad that he did because it was his birthday. 
Pappardale was also delicious, cooked with braised rabbit, buttered leeks, apricot. It was just amazing. They make their pasta in house and it's yumm. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Came in on a Tuesday night with no reservations, they sat us at the window which was fine with us because we could people watch while we ate. 

We had previously looked at the menu and we're excited to come in. Drinks were promptly served and food came quickly even though the place was packed. 

I ordered the ash crusted deer which was amazing and cooked perfectly. 

For appetizers we ordered the wild boar gyoza and the wild mushroom tarte which was unreal. Everything tastes fresh and not too rich. My father ordered the rainbow trout and enjoyed every bite. The cocktail menu seemed good even though I stuck with wine. They have a decent beer list. 

I'd love to come back and sit at a regular table."}
{"text":"Good service. Good casual dim lighting atmosphere similar to Enoteca Sociale but perhaps with a bit more privacy. Open kitchen, overall nice environment. 

Cocktail was yummy, not too sweet, just perfect for me. 

Gyoza wasn't that memorable to me. 

Mushroom tart was yummy, the pesto/sauce that came with it was too overwhelming for me

Chestnut gnocchi - yummy the garnish/ veg that came with it was unfortunately the same or too similar to the beet salad we ordered so we were both disappointed that it felt we doubled up nothing special. I know it does stand out as a different kind of beet salad out there .. maybe i had high expectations and unfortunately tonight we didn't order any actual meat entrees. 

I will come back to try the meat and hope I will enjoy the food more next time."}
{"text":"Brought my parents there this weekend, and they were also blown away. We ordered the bread, the charcuterie board, bison rib eye, venison sirloin, the game burger and the rabbit pappardelle. 

Yeah that's right, bread - and we got two baskets of them. It was served with this maple infused butter that we just cannot get enough of! 

Charcuterie - beautiful presentation of different game meats. It was a perfect platter for those who wants to try different smoked meats, pate, foie and you name it. Again, devoured.

Bison ribeye - beautifully seared and charred on the outside and medium rare tender on the inside. It is gamey, juicy and absolutely delicious. 

Game burger - still can't get over it, even though we've had it quite a few times now. 

Rabbit pappardelle - al dente pasta topped with a very rich, velvety cream sauce. So guilty, but SO GOOD. 

Venison - perhaps this was the only dish we felt was only okay. The cook on the venison was perfect, seared nicely on the outside, medium rare on the inside. But keep in mind venison is a leaner meat, so the texture is completely different from a rib eye of a bison. The meat itself is not as flavourful and gamey as the bison. If you were to ever try this, I recommend you eating the venison (leaner sirloin steak) before eating the bison ribeye (fattier cut).

Again, parents were super satisfied and so were we!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch today at Antler. I've been here twice before, and it has never disappointed me and is always a treat. I had the Himalayas drink today, well balanced and not too sweet with rose gin, lillet, lemon, violet and a couple other ingredients, not overly flowery, beautiful. My partner had the game burger and claimed it as the best burger he's ever had. I had the in house smoked salmon eggs Benedict and it was perfection - beautifully gooey yolk, excellent hollandaise, not too heavy, just right. Nice fluffy English muffin and the in house smoked salmon was melt in your mouth smokey savoury deliciousness. We've been for dinner before and the food was outstanding - as well as the smoke barrel cocktail is such a good drink, I've never tasted a cocktail like that in the city, so beautifully balanced. I could go on raving about this place, I'm excited to try their lunch options as I've read they soon will be open during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Keep up the good work boys. The owner of this place is an exceptional human being. Expect a wait but it's well worth it. Getting in can be a little tricky but chin up. A fantastic experience awaits you and your guests at Antler."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and fantastic service! Our waitress was helpful in recommending what's good on the menu and very friendly. Atmosphere was casual and warm. We went in the summer and they had the windows open. I'd definitely return to try out some of the other items."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from me and is already one of my go-to's for a nice date-night dinner without having to trek too far. Service is always excellent and I have yet to order something I don't like. That they actually make my Hendricks gin and soda with a cucumber earns a star itself. I never specifically ask for the cucumber when I go out for drinks but I always appreciate a bartender who automatically knows to make it with one. Details. 

Last time, I tried the rabbit papparadelle, and while it was more rich than I was anticipating, it was delicious and even tasted good as leftovers the next day. I also fell in love with the rack of deer after stealing a bite from my partner's plate. After all this talk of their food I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Antler is one of those restaurants that I really wish Yelp would give the 0.5 option because they were actually on my 3.5 list (on the basis of service - read on if you don't want to freeze while eating your meal).  The reason why we decided to visit Antler was all the hoopla about these protests and we were genuinely curious.  We also looked into their menu and found it quite appealing.  I made the reservation approximately 3 weeks prior to going (on March 28, 2018...according to my records on my e-mail). 

When we arrived, we were seated pretty much at the worst possible table right in front of the door.  It was a very cold day and I knew this door was going to keep opening and closing.  I then politely asked our host if we could be seated in the many other empty two-person tables inside and they said that they were all reserved well in advanced.  He also swore by the fact that this curtain they had in front of the door would protect us from the harsh windy elements.  I shrugged it off thinking that it was a genuine answer (even though I made this reservation 3 weeks in advanced).  

We ordered their charcuterie board, their bison steak, and their burger.  The steak and burger were quite good. The broccolini on their steak was quite old and bitter but everything else was cooked very nicely.  The chacuterie board was lacking a bit in variety but it was passable.  Throughout our meal, our server was friendly and polite.  We ended our night with a toffee pudding dessert, which was quite good.  

Honestly, when i'm dining though, I like to dine in comfort and the whole time, my boyfriend and I were freezing our butts off.  The server/host swore by the fact that this curtain they had in front of their door was going to ward off the harsh elements.  Wrong.  It totally didn't.  It made our whole dining experience actually quite unpleasant.   Water service was also quite slow because we were allllll the way at the very end.  

As time passed (and even towards the very end of our meal), these two-seaters were NOT filled.  In the middle of our meal, this cute tall blond girl came in for her reservation and she was seated in another table close (but not directly) at the door and she asked for a seat change and was promptly given one.  I think that was the snap factor where I thought that that was pure prejudice.

The moral of this story is that no matter how good your food is, the service is what counts the most and what could have been done was that the host could have at the very least offered an inner table and given a time limit.  We would have taken it.  This adamant refusing of giving us another table and giving some Caucasian, blond a different table at the snap of a finger was completely unfair.  For that, they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I found a hair in my food, the service was terrible and so was the food. It took me at least 25 minutes to get my drink and double that to get my food. It wasn't busy so I'm not sure what was wrong with this place. Overall, it was a terrible experience. There is a lot of other restaurants I'd recommend over this place. The only thing that was decent was their homemade bread."}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal at the Antler. One of the best new places I've tried in a while. We ordered:

Farmers Market Salad - shaved local Ontario vegetables, spring greens, sunflower seeds, fresh Portuguese goat cheese, sumac vinaigrette

Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer - braised shoulder, parsnip purée, swiss chard

Rainbow Trout - celery root purée, charred kale, caramelized kohlrabi, swiss chard, salsa verde

The venison was amazing - A MUST! The other two dishes were delicious as well. I will be returning to the Antler Kitchen & Bar - guaranteed. I would like to try their burger...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: I returned to the Antler to try their burger and it was spectacular; gamey meat with the gamey taste - a must try:

Game Burger - wild boar, bison, deer, hot mustard, garlic aioli, house smoked cheddar (add foie gras)

Side Note: I also tried the Jamaican Venison Patty & Wild Boar or Sweet Potato Gyoza which are well worth the try..."}
{"text":"Steven the head bartender here deserves recognition, he was extremely knowledgeable, on point with his services, and gave off great vibes. We decided not to take all of his suggestions, but we opt for the gyoza (wild boar dumplings) which were full of flavour and apparently only made by ONE of the owners, then we shared the mushroom tarte which was good (I felt like the crust to stuffing ratio was off and it needed a bit more filling). The beet salad was great, the fried capers really added to it. The spiced ash rack of deer was SO delicious, unbelievably tender, along with the plate pairing I thought it was a generous serving of braised shoulder. For dessert you MUST try the (unique) cedar ice (cream) and the crab apple pie (with cheddar in the crust). Interesting cocktails were being made the entire time along with premium liquor and a decent wine selection, tried the Caesar and they have house made concoction they add to the Clamato. We'll be back for sure. (Trying the patty next time)"}
{"text":"Locked coming here. The game and meat options are first class and perfectly  prepared. 
I was blown away by the deer main and the mushroom app. 

Wine selection is excellent and a lot of great options. 

The smoked dessert was mind blowing."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday. In general the food is really good. Everything was tasty, gyoza was OK. Good service, takes a little bit too much time, but not terribly long. Pastas are really amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely going to this place soon, I hear it's fantastic! The protesters are giving tons of free publicity And so I look this place up in the pictures look sensational so on our next northern trip I'm putting this on the list for sure!"}
{"text":"Antler is excellent. Brunch or dinner, everything was delicious and I would highly recommend to anybody that is game for some game ;)
5 STARS"}
{"text":"Ethically farmed meat and tastes delicious"}
{"text":"The most unbelievable food. The spiced ash Deer is out of this world. Seriously, no question, one of the best restaurants in Toronto. It blew my mind.
Knowledgable staff and great service. Intimate and perfect for dates or small group of friends."}
{"text":"What really caught my eye about Antler was their menu featuring regionally-sourced foods.

My mum and I made our reservations awhile ago and we finally got to visit on a Sunday evening.

We ordered the wild mushroom risotto and venison tartare which were both really good. The mushrooms in the risotto stood out for all the right reasons.

For dessert we had the smoked chocolate mousse which completely blew my mind: it's brought to you inside a glass dome filled with smoke. Not only was the presentation creative, but it also tasted out of this world: The smokiness really added another dimension to the dish. I also loved the walnut crisps.

Our server was really nice and let me sample some of their wines before making a final decision."}
{"text":"Rudest service ever!!!!! this place is overrated for a brunch spot, mildred's temple kitchen is better! The waiter (tall mixed hipster with glasses) actually told our group to keep our voices down and be quiet; it was 12 PM with hardly anyone else there. I guess it was OK for him to act like a dick considering he already had an automatic 18% tip added on the bill."}
{"text":"Great find outside of downtown Toronto. Would love to have sampled more but only tried the Vennison Patty and Ricotta Cavatelli with wild boar- both were well above average with the pasta in particular being a standout. 

Wine and ambiance was also great though can see this place getting busy on Friday/Saturday (I went on a Sunday). 

Well worth a shot and will be coming back again at some point myself."}
{"text":"I visited Antler for dinner and it was a fabulous meal!

Antler is all about gamey meats. I came here specifically for this and it certainly did not disappoint! 

Me and my dining companions had:

Venison tartare: A great appetizer for sharing

Charcuterie plate: With duck pate, deer heart, beef bresala, duck and pork terrine. Delicious!

Roasted deer leg: Succulent and tender. Came with asparagus and corn bread. Good!

A bison steak: With morel mushrooms and rapini. It was grilled to perfection and delicious!

Spiced ash crusted rack of deer: Visually stunning. With fiddleheads, pea and foraged stining nettle puree. This was amazing!

Priced were not cheap, but given what we got, we though it was justified. We decided to skip on desserts and walked to Bang Bang instead.

Overall, big fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Delightful spot for brunch! Good food and service, and appreciated the beautiful window seating area. We got the forager's omelette with home fried smashed potatoes, eggs Benedict with salmon and green salad, and a side of the house made pork belly. Everything was a great, though I did wish the hollandaise sauce had been hotter and the potatoes smaller and more bite size, but these are obviously not big complaints. The Caesar I had was also a real treat, beautifully garnished and perfectly boozy. The smoked salmon on the benny just melted in your mouth and the mushrooms in the omelette were supple and delicious.

Only real bummer was that we were surprised by a charge for the water that was brought to the table, added an unexpected $9 to our bill. Nothing crazy, but wouldn't have had it if we'd known. 

Will definitely be back in any case!"}
{"text":"Sous-vide poached eggs!?!! Say no more! 

This was my first time trying it and it won't be my last!  I'm not sure if it's the method of poaching the eggs or the eggs itself but what I got was two perfectly poached eggs with uber yellow-orangey yolk running down on wild smoked salmon and crunchy English muffins, it was literally heaven in my mouth.  I haven't had salmon egg Benny this good in a while.  It had the perfect mixture of flavours and texture.  For the sides, you can choose potatoes or salad, I chose the salad after a weekend of dining out.  I loved the dressing on the salad, it was a creamy dressing that really enhanced the flavours of the egg Benny. 

Our second order was the blueberry french toast, it was just ok to me. Their coffee comes in 2 sizes served from a French press.  The $4 will give you 1.5 cups while the $6 will give you approximately 3.5 cups. 

Good brunch without lineups is rare for the Toronto brunch scene. Better get to it before everyone else finds out about it."}
{"text":"A friend and I made a reservation using OpenTable, which apparently also means OpenBarStool, because they sat us at the bar close to the dishwasher, which wasn't a great experience. My experience with making reservations a week ahead of time online is that you get an actual table. We did not get a table, we probably got the worst seat at the bar near the dishwasher. It didn't help that there was a group of 8 bros behind us bumping into us, communicating in the audible broey fashion that bros like to communicate with each other in, and putting their empty drink glasses in front of us at our table. We could tell they were belligerent and annoying the staff, and when I politely asked if they could ask them to stop crowding behind us, yelling in our ears, and bumping into our chairs, one of the staff said there's nothing they could do because they were waiting for a table. I think the organization of taking reservations and seating people while they're waiting for the table needs improvement. 

The theme here is forest: game meat, foraged mushrooms, and the taste of trees. I liked the theme. I'm a fan of game meat and the taste and smell of trees. 

We got some cocktails. They do a good job with the cocktails. Interesting ingredients and processes, like smoking things, infusing their own spirits, etc. The cocktails were well-made. 

We had lots of servers, maybe 4 in total. We were ignored for much of the time, had to fill our own water (which I don't terribly mind), but when we needed something we basically had to yell at whoever was behind the bar at the time because no one really came to check on us near the beginning. 

I ordered the bison rib eye. It was ok, nothing special. It was tender like I would expect a bison rib eye to be, but it tasted pretty generic as far as steaks go. The accompanying hedgehog mushrooms were ok too. The sauce or seasonings weren't special. The polenta base was unique, though. There was a lot of fat on the steak, in the middle but also along the edges, so much of what came on the plate was waste.  It looked like I was throwing out half a steak but it was fat. 

We ordered dessert. While waiting for our dessert they gave us what they called a palate cleanser. It was a sample of one of their dessert items, the cedar ice. It was lemony sweet ice with cedar, topped with either a wild blueberry or black currant reduction sauce. That was actually quite good. 

The desserts we ordered included the sticky toffee pudding with pine needle ice cream, and the chocolate brownie. The sticky toffee was quite good, but the brownie dessert was dry and unoriginal. 

Overall I felt the food was pretty average, the cocktails were the best part, and the service was poor, especially considering the reservations and the group behind us waiting for their table.

The bills were like $80 per person after tax. I didn't feel the experience warranted the price paid so I find that I didn't get good value out of the experience. 

If you still wanted to go, I would recommend calling and speaking to a person to ensure that your reservation is at a table and not at the bar. I feel like where we sat and how poorly executed the waiting to seat people process was was a huge reason why my review is so low. If it was based on food and cocktails alone I probably would give them a 3."}
{"text":"Small intimate restaurant that packs a huge punch in flavour. We sat by the window as we were lucky enough to get a last minute reservation.  The staff were so accommodating with such a great attitude. They were so helpful with the menu and suggested that I try the wild boar gyoza and venison Jamaican patty and the game burger, and my husband ordered the rack of venison. It was the most delicious meal I've had in a very long time...so very impressed, we cannot wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about Antler we wanted to give Antler a try. 

We ordered the pheasant pot pie and game burger for dinner, we started with the delicious house made bread.. one basket was not enough. The pheasant pie had a really nice flavour and was served piping hot. Although it was an appetizer size I was quiet full. ( my plan was to save room for dessert) the burger was said to be \"the best burger ever\" juicy and flavourful but extremely filling!! ( no room for dessert) 

The dessert was a smoked chocolate moose with berries and whipped cream the wonder of ordering this dessert is it comes to the table under a cloche filled with smoke and the dessert is relieved as the smoke dissipates. 

It was certainly not all \"smoke and mirrors\" the dessert was very delicious, and hit the spot of my rather large sweet tooth. 

Overall the experience was delightfully the atmosphere is casual but refined, the service was impeccable. The owner makes a point of checking in with all the tables and personally thanking you for your business. And although the price is steep you are receiving an experience well worth it. 

There commitment to local, farm to table cooking is something all restaurants should strive for.  

Only tips I have, make sure you book your reservation ahead of time Antler is small and intimate. Perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"Brunch 5 stars
Dinner 4 stars
Overall is 4.5 stars 

My first review is of the brunch experience which is worthy of the trek to Dundas West!  Definitely well done and food is great.  Dinner is also good here... would it compare to my other 5s (Buca, Boralia, and Grey Gardens), not quite but that shouldn't take away from the fact I did like my dinner here.

Similar to brunch, the dinner menu incorporates game meats and local vegetables to craft up an interesting menu where have lots of interesting choices as a carnivore or vegetarian.  There are GF free options here too so they're on point for noticing different dietary needs.
Service here was casual and friendly... a tad less attentive than our perfect service at brunch but still good nevertheless.

We decided to order 3 appetizers and 2 entrees with a very good cherry based cider from a local brand West Avenue.  Pacing of the appetizer was nearly rapid fire where all 3 came within minutes of each other and we didn't clear the first apps before the another one arrived.  

Venison Jamaican Patty - An interesting twist to the Jamaican patty where I get flashbacks to university days of dried out patties sat in the cafeteria.  Well Antler puts that old memory aside!  Tender crust houses a moist and flavourful venison that would surprise most people as it not dry or gamey.  I know some people think game meat is pungent or too lean.  Not here!  The venison is bordering on a tad too soft but I'm wondering if its cause it has a decent amount of sauce in it?  The scotch bonnet sauce that comes with it is REALLY good.  The patty is a solid 4 but the sauce is so good that I wanted to dip everything in it.  So I'm bumping this up to a 4.5/5 

Tomato tarte tatin - Tarte tatin is usually a dessert on menus so was quite interesting to see this take.  It is with smoked fior di latte, 2 types of tomatos (a heartier heirloom tomato and the sweeter smaller cherry tomato), pickled onions, and a pastry base.  Someone commented how its almost like a pizza and I have to agree... if France took a pizza and made it their own, this is possibly how they would do it.  When you put all the components together, it made for a nice bite.  The pickled onion cut through the gooey richer cheese while the 2 types of tomatoes gave a nice sweetness and lighter vegetal acidity... alllll on top of a flakier crust.  I do recommend eating this one a bit quicker cause the tomato are just exploding in tomato juice and makes the pastry become a west sponge later.  Another little note, the components are all plated nicely in their own section of the tarte... It made it harder to get all the components in one bite without mushing up the entire tart.  4/5

Sweet Potato Gyoza - Pan fried dumplings that had mashed sweet potato with their own sake soya sauce blend to dip.  I'm not gonna lie, the gyoza tasted better with the scotch bonnet sauce from the Jamaican Patty.  It really needed that kick of flavour to make this one be better.  Still from a cooking perspective, nicely crisp dumpling skin so it's well executed.  3.5/5

Farmer's Market Vegetarian Gnocchi - This was explained as being a Parisian gnocchi made with ricotta to add lightness instead of the usual potato and flour combo.  I've made ricotta gnocchi Parisian style at home and normally they're pan fried with butter at the last moment.  These weren't so I'm not sure how these are Parisian.  Also these were much denser and chewier than my own ricotta gnocchi.  Aside from those 2 issues, the dish had a decent variety of different vegetables, it had pattypan squash (squat and tiny squashes that look like fancy spinning tops), asparagus, zucchini, radishes, and some sauteed greens (broccolini?).  It's all brought together with a good pesto.  This is a decent dish but could have been elevated a bit more by having the gnocchi lighter and actually be pan fried Parisian style 3.5/5

Bison Flank Steak - This is a good looking plate with a really nice flank steak.  Similar story to the venison, there's no gamey flavour.  It is leaner cause it is game meat but flank steak is normally lean anyhow.  They cooked it really nicely to a medium and I would say that they did an great job on it.  Juicy and tender and making good use of the red wine jus to up the flavour.  It came with a smear of creamy polenta, fresh peas, mushrooms, and a few sprigs of sauteed broccolini.  I felt the bison flavour was fairly mild so it really needed the red wine jus... it could have perhaps benefited more of a stronger flavour sauce.  Comparing this to another game steak (Elk at Boralia), this was good but just didn't have the flavour pop as much. 4/5

Overall, this is a good place to enjoy a dinner that shows a bit of Canadiana and an excellent place for brunch.  Service can be good to great and just adds to the overall nice atmosphere this place brings.  Definitely grab a spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and a great concept for a restaurant. 

I have been wanting to go to this place for a while and finally got the opportunity. Sat at the bar with my girlfriend on a Saturday night and was not disappointed. Restaurant was fully booked and it's no wonder why. 

Their theme is wild and foraged ingredients selected by the chef. Ordered 'The Hunter' cocktail which was delicious. My dining partner ordered some type of beet-sage cocktail which she also thoroughly enjoyed. 

We had a wild mushroom tart as an app recommended by the server/bartender. It had a great earthy mushroom and garlic flavour perfectly crispy and flaky. 

We shared a venison rack and rabbit gnocchi. The venison was to-die-for. Perfectly cooked at the chefs recommendation and extremely succulent. The rabbit dish was also tasty - complimented by fresh leeks. 

All the food is very rich. I wish i could remember the dishes to describe with more detail but I left in a food coma so my memory is hazy. 

I would highly recommend to any foodie or outdoors person."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, amazing food. Overall an excellent meal. But there's no air conditioning and we were there on a 40 degree day so it was really really warm inside and I sweat alot...

Foraged cedar gin sour: not sure cedar adds much but its a beautiful drink and very easy to drink. Not too sour.

Melon in the woods: easy to drink and sweet.

Charcoal grilled yakitori duck heart: so tasty, really enjoyes this wish there was more :)

Wild mushroom tarte tatin: this was so savoury and flavourful. The crust was so good and went well with the wild mushrooms.

Spice ash crusted rack of deer: really tasty, didn't know it could taste this good.

Pappardelle: this hand made pasta with rabbit meat is probably the best pasta I ever had.

Peach tart: really sweet and a great mix of soft and crunchy.

Brownie and ice cream topped with cedar: cedar feels kinda gimmicky but the warm brownie with ice cream is a good mix."}
{"text":"It pains me to give them such a low rating as I had such a high expectations. I made a reservation for brunch on a Saturday, and when I arrived with my friends they had completely forgotten to save us a table and told us to wait for a 4 person table to open up. This took more than 15 minutes which I would have been okay with if the server was apologetic about making us wait despite having made a reservation. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and when we finally sat, we ordered right away and still waited more than 30 minutes to get our orders....the wrong orders at that. My friend and I ordered  the smoked salmon sandwich which consisted of a fried egg and smoked salmon on an english muffin, a dish we both did not expect would take so long to make and when we got the wrong order...i knew my experience at the restaurant was pretty much at the lowest. It definitely affected how the food tasted, so I admit that thjs review is very biased against the food. The redeeming factor at the end was the manager coming over to finally apologize and comp us our sandwiches. It's hard to say how much better the food would have tasted if everything had gone more smoothly, but overall the sandwich was just a-okay"}
{"text":"I love game meat and was very excited to eat at Antler! The selection wasn't the greatest - was expecting a wider variety of game meat. Quality of the meat was excellent. Style felt a little uninspired. In the end it was not worth the money. I'd rather buy good quality meat and cook it myself."}
{"text":"Well worth the long walk from downtown. While the wild boar gyoza was just OK (should have picked the sweet potato) the Cornish Hen was cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of crunch on the skin yet moist and tender inside. And the accompanying veggies were almost better than the meat. The Antler beer brewed specially for them had a nice touch of smoked wood once you let it warm up a bit.  Will definitely visit again to try more entrees. And those sweet potato pot stickers!"}
{"text":"It's a brunch gem in the west end for sure! Nice atmosphere and the crowd is hip. Food was really good especially the sous vide poached eggs!"}
{"text":"I'd give this 4.5, but it deserves closer to 5.

The food was excellent.  I ordered the rack of deer.  It was served, plated, and prepared, like a 5 star restaurant.  My friend had the ricotta cavatelli - wild boar ragu, which was also very good.  The wild mushroom tart was a standout.

We sat at the bar, and the service was professional, a little unpolished (one of the servers was self-admittedly new), but still friendly & eager.

The space itself has a great vibe. 

Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"One of the best meals/ dining experiences I've had in awhile.

Went here with an old colleague for dinner and drinks. Cocktails are pricey (but similar to most other downtown restaurants) but delicious. We ordered the Wild Mushroom Tarte Tartin (incredible! highly recommend), the Papparadelle Pasta (also amazing), the Rack of Deer and the Vension Tartarte. Everything was impeccable. 

Our server was a lovely gentleman who provided some great recommendations. Nice vibe in the restaurant as well - not overly loud but still had a good vibe. 

Overall, a truly wonderful dining experience. Have recommended it to a lot of friends and will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, really great find and local restaurant. The restaurant is intimate, but with a great vibe and the decor is modern and clean. Great menu choices, we tried about half the menu and really didn't have anything we wouldn't have ordered again. Nice surprises were the Jamaican beef patty with venison, wild boar gyoza (with a very delicate wrapper) and they do a really nice job with the charcuterie and the cheese plate.

For dinner we had the trout, special linq cod and cavatelli. Everything was fresh, beautifully plated and very well composed. The linq cod came with a beautiful squid ink sauce with romano beans.

Desserts were good, not quite as great as the earlier courses, but nice inventive options. Folks at the table talked about great cocktails as well.

Our waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Great dinner for all! It gets busy though so make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Good canadian eats with a focus on game meat. Great attention to sauce flavours. Ginger ice cream and apple tart phyllo pastry was a good ending."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner and it was off the walls amazing. Our server James (also bartender)  was super kind and helpful and makes the best drinks! The cedar gin sour was amazing, I wanted 5. I had the mushroom risotto and I thought I went to heaven, the boyfriend got the game burger and that was awesome too. 
This place rocks, everybody should go  their mushrooms are soooo good.
The guy next to us got a bison steak and just the smells coming off of that thing was to die for."}
{"text":"Outstanding food with a great deal of farm/forage to table options. Really fresh and seasonal.  Service was excellent as were the cocktails.  Our table of four had various dishes and all were excellent - we ended up passing plates around so people could taste everything. Strongly recommend Antlers."}
{"text":"VERY LOUD. Not a soft surface in the place. The service was good as were some of the dishes. There was a very loud (read yelling), obnoxious, and racist table next to us. We asked the manager to address it, but he was not willing to ask the table to keep it down - so sad! Overall, it ruined our experience and we would not bother to return, especially since it's a bit of a trek from downtown. Too bad, we were really looking forward to eating there, but simply can't recommend it."}
{"text":"Many have hyped up this place has Toronto's version of a Joe Beef or Au Pied De Cochon; but Antler is a grower and not a shower. Fairly new, Antler shows potential, but is still far from the hype. 

Drinks are below average (the worst Moscow Mule I've ever had). The portions are rather small, especially for the entrées. Price wise, it's a bit pricey considering you might have to swing by McDonald's for a few double cheese burgers to fill you up."}
{"text":"Antler takes the farm to table template and escalates it to woods to table ... sort of. Because of laws regarding serving game, the \"wild\" game here is farm raised. Other ingredients are likely \"foraged\" from a similar setting, but it matters not - this is unique and delicious. 

We toured the menu, starting with venison tartar (excellent) and wonderfully seasoned wild boar dumplings. I recommend both. 

Cocktails were also had:

The Rusty Antler is a single malt Highland park, with jerky infused drambuie (more smokey than meaty), and black walnut bitters (Fee's I presume). It's a smokey but remarkably balanced drink. Very earthy. 

The Kordonis is gin with beet purée, sumac, basil, and Demerara syrup. First stip goes into boozy gazpacho territory, but a few sips in it really comes together. Another creative earthy drink that fits the menu. 

The oddball, just because it was unique to the very game centric food we had, was their take on the gin sour (complete with foraged cedar). It was excellent, just contrasting the others. They have a fish dish. This would be a good pairing with that and some vinegar forward appetizer. 

The main courses were rack of deer and bison ribeye with foraged mushrooms in jus. The deer was just alright. Tad on the bland side. It was probably hurt by how amazing the ribeye was. This is a must have and my wife, having tried it - felt let down returning to her deer. This is a must have, though if you don't like rich meats than you may prefer the deer. 

Desert was a walnut brownie. A sweet ending, but maybe anticlimactic ? Possibly I was just having diet guilt. 

The coffee was fantastic. Americano or press available. 

This was a great meal. Nice staff. Nice music. Cool decor. We will be back and recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"All good was amazing! Appetizer - charcoal grilled yakitori, all three - duck heart, wild mushrooms and Chicken thigh. Everything was perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth. Mains were Bruce country Ontario venison and bison ribeye. Both dishes were delicious. The only thing we both didnt like is greens that come with bison. But greens are not our thing in general. If I could choose I'd put asparagus there instead. Dessert were Ontario strawberry semifreddo and smoked chocolate mousse. Chocolate mousse is brought out under a glass plate with smoke underneath it, so if you want a video, be ready with your phone. Both desserts were very delicious. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I visited Antler in mid-February, when a friend from Switzerland wanted to try something 'Canadian'. The place was fully booked, but they had space at the table in the window by the door. It was a freezing evening outside, but the curtain managed to keep out most of the cold when the door opened.
The server was a lot of fun and we shared many laughs.
The food was absolutely delicious! I had the Venison Tartare and the Cavatelli with Wild Boar, while my friend had the Mushroom Tarte Tartin and the Rainbow Trout. The flavours were great and we were impressed to hear that the chef uses local ingredients. I definitely want to go back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for our wedding anniversary last year and I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to write this review. If you love game meat as much as I do, then this is definitely for you. 

We ordered the venison tartare, the wild boar and sweet potato gyoza, the pappardelle with braised rabbit, the spice ash crusted rack of deer and the foie gras. Everything was delicious! It is a place that we will definitely go back to and will most likely make it our anniversary spot! It's that good. Again, you must like game meat to really appreciate this place.

It's a pretty small restaurant so definitely make reservations if planning on eating here on a busy night. We had prosecco that evening so cant really comment on the cocktails, but they sound and looked delicious."}
