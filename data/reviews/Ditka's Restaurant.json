{"text":"If only it wasn't in a casino, I'd give it a 5 and come back more often. Thankfully, no smell of smoke inside.   We were seated promptly at a booth and had a good time. Came here expecting over priced, bland food. Apparently I was in for a surprise.  Our server was prompt and nice. Hubby gave him 8 out of 10 rating (we ran too low on drinks once). The foooooood.....best calamari ever! Crispy, soft, and TASTY without the deep fried oily feeling. Don't usually like tartar sauce but loved this one.  Linguini was delicious-nice, subtle zing and scrumptious prawn.  Steak was succulent and delectable. We didn't have room for dessert because the portions were huge.  Reasonably priced for great food and large portions."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Ditka's. Started with a Shrimp Cocktail which was actually pretty good.   Followed up with the crab bisque. Had to ask for cracked pepper instead of the server asking. Really needed something to add flavor which was lacking.   Ordered the Prime Rib 16OZ cut rare but it came medium. Again No flavor. Definitely needed the au jus provided.   Wife ordered the Filet and Crab Cake (pictured). I guess their idea of a filet is actually just a medallion.   All this for the fine price of around $140 including tip. Not really worth it unless stuck with nowhere else to go."}
{"text":"It is in the casino, the decor is nice with big half moon booths and linen on the table. The food was ok. The server was nice but was very new at waiting tables and got flustered a couple of times and forgot to bring drinks at the beginning. I thought that maybe the manager that was lingering at the hostess desk should have been making rounds to the tables and checking on the server (especially since she was new) It was ok."}
{"text":"The prime rib is great, which by itself makes it worth going, the fish Friday is pretty good, avoid the meatloaf, it is dry and has a layer of bread in the serving, which makes it a bit difficult to eat, we love the Friday night $5 martinis they are reasonable size and fun for dinner if you don't usually go for that you should give it a try, the mud pie is big but covered in candy which sucks and makes it really hard to eat if you wanted ice cream and not candy, always friendly service, and last very poor beer selection, when will restaurants realize there is this craft beer thing going on and put some on tap?"}
{"text":"Made reservations for our anniversary. My wife ordered the shrimp and chicken pasta dish and it was ok nothing special but ok. I ordered the $43 bone in prime ribeye med rare .... This thing comes to me fresh off the hoof ... I mean it's almost mooing. .. Another waitress seen  my disgust and offers to send it back which I decided no . ... Cuz now I know I am going to get shoe leather back if it goes back into that kitchen. ... Now we are off to desert creme breule. ... We don't really notice until biting into but the sugar on top is burned we work are way around it and when our waiter asked how it was I said burnt. .. He looked at it  the at me at it again and said yup it's a little over done there  ... and still charged me for it LOL ..... I'll never go back not even for a free dinner. ..."}
{"text":"The experience at overall at Ditka's was not something that was worth the time nor the money. The service was among the worst I've had at any restaurant. In between each course there was little to no attention given over the course of nearly two and a half hours. The salad given didn't come with the dressing listed and created a bland starter. In addition the sweet potatoes that came with the main course were far too overcooked to the point they were unedible. The lobster that was part of the Valentine's special was far too overcooked and became rubbery and difficult to eat. Our waitress never asked how things were and the restaurant was not busy. Every other table looked upset as well with the overall service. In addition with the special there was desert but the wrong one was brought out. The mango sorbet that was brought on accident tasted overtly sweet and was inedible. I imagine that with the proper staff this could be a decent place to go but I wouldn't recommend it for the experience we had."}
{"text":"The food here is marginal compared with other high end steak houses in town. Went there a couple weeks back with my wife. Both entree's were undercooked and had to be sent back.. Ordered a white russian for a before dinner drink that didn't taste anything like a white russian should taste. Service was ok. Atmosphere was nice I'll give it that. Now we can say we tried it once but no plans on going back."}
{"text":"Atomsphere and food runners were the only good thing about this place. Waitress was rude, and passive aggressive. $38 dollar steak over cooked came with no sides. Waitress said \"well it'a a steak house\" I've been to many steak houses they come with sides. Steak was bland had no flavor, I've had a much better steak at Denny's Dinner. Waitress threw some wicked shade when we said no to desert. Overall just a horrible experience ruined our night."}
{"text":"My husband made dinner reservations for 2/15/14.  We arrived 10 minutes early and were immediately seated.  The waiter came along and placed napkins in our lap and said he would be right back.  We thought, wow this is going to excellent.  15 minutes later the waiter came back to take out drink order and let us know he would be back to take our order and go over the menu.  It took 10 more minutes to get our drinks and after being there for 40 minutes our dinner order was finally taken. We ordered the coach's special which was a 4 oz fillet, a lobster tail and asparagus along with a cup of Lobster bisque.  The bisque came out within 5 minutes and was absolutely wonderful and we thought maybe this was worth the wait.  Our meal was brought out and our steaks were overcooked, my lobster was very bitter.  My husbands was lobster was good.  Not one time during our meal did our waiter come over and ask how our meal was.  We left the restaurant 1 hour and 20 minutes after arriving and left completely let down.  The restaurant was not packed at all, in fact it had many empty tables.  I have searched everywhere to find a place to contact Ditka's directly and have been unable to find a way.  I am not attempting to get a free meal as I will not be going back and I am not trying to be reimbursed.  I do feel that Ditka's should know just how horrible the food and service was."}
{"text":"I went to Ditka's last night with my boyfriend and his mother to celebrate his birthday. We made reservations at 8 but we were able to move the reservation to 7. It was not crowded on a Thursday night.  We started off with the pot roast nachos. The pot roast itself is delicious but on the sweet side as it is made with merlot. I'm used to a more savory pot roast but it was still good. The chips are made in house but I found nothing special about them. Tomatoes, jalapenos, cheese...what you would expect on nachos.  I got the perfect raspberi margarita. It was strong and not as sweet as I thought it would be. Not tart but sour. My boyfriend got the Southside cocktail which was too overwhelmed by the mint but he loved it. He also got a mojito which was good. The drinks were very strong! We both got a buzz off of them. I got the crab bisque which was very tasty. It had a LOT of cream so it had better be! Lol My boyfriend had the French onion and he said it was very good (I did not care to try it). I ordered Mike's salad and was brought a MONSTROUS salad! It was very good but I was already stuffed and could not finish...or even eat half of it. It had plenty of goat cheese and cranberries...but it had four tiny strips of the chicken. I'd have to take a star off for that. My boyfriend ordered the coach's meatloaf. He loved it! It was also a gigantic portion! Its all piled high on a plate...bottom is the cornbread and then the bbq coated meatload, then mashed potatoes, and then fried onion rings. His mother ordered  \"da pork chop\" (single boned). It came with at LEAST a pound of sweet potato mash. The cherry jus was different and she said the pork was very tender for the size of the cut. Lastly, we had a free chocolate cake slice to celebrate his birthday.  It was a very good dinner. Probably the nicest restaurant I've ever been too lol We had a nice time but I don't think it's in our budget to go more often!"}
{"text":"Ditka's had a nice atmosphere, comfortable seating, good service, reasonable prices for a fine dining steak house and most importantly, delicious food! I ordered the bone-in filet, oscar style. It was wonderfully flavorful. Other guest at our table had \"Da Pork Chop\" , filet medallions with crab cakes and  filet medallions with shrimp scampi. All of the portions were very generous and everyone said the food was great. If I had to critique, the restaurant temperature was very cold. Also myself and another guest ordered Grey Goose cosmos and they definitely weren't cosmos. They were more like lemon drops, but either way they were delicious and we each ordered seconds. Overall I was very pleased. I would recommend Ditka's and I hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Great food. A little pricey but very tasty. I kinda wish I didn't have to order a huge side dish to share because it was a little too much but overall a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Went for a special event to meet Coach Ditka. Fantastic pork chops with this amazing side sauce. Also the mashed sweat potatoes rock! Not the best filet I've ever had... But a good cook, sear and all. Good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went out to VQ simply for this restaurant. The service was excellent, and the wine was great as well. However, the food was lack luster at best. We had the bruschetta for an appetizer and split the seafood tower for our entree. Maybe our mistake was getting the seafood tower at a steak place, but it isn't worth the $60 for the tower itself.   The atmosphere, service, and setting were all spectacular."}
{"text":"Not the most convenient location.    The first 16 miles of the hike over South Mountain from Ahwatukee is scenic, peaceful, and enjoyable.  But the last couple of miles of trail off the mountain to the restaurant and casino are not well marked, creating an unnecessary detour to reach the restaurant.    Worse, the restaurant does not clearly advertise that they are closed on Tuesdays, leaving you mighty hungry for the 18 mile hike back home."}
{"text":"Ordered their aged steak... Ordered it medium rare... Wow that was horrible. The steak was charred on the outside and didn't have any flavor to it. I also added on the lobster tail for $38 extra and that too was horrible. On the bright side their hamburger was pretty good. Well that is what my cousin told me. I will not be going back at all.  Save your money and goto Flemmings or durants."}
{"text":"I imagine this being a place Fraiser and Niles would eat at. Leave Daphne and Martin at home with Eddie and get some filet with crabcakes."}
{"text":"My husband and I and 3 of out best friends went to Ditka's to celebrate our anniversary and Valentines day.  We had reservations and our table was waiting for us.  We were even seated early.  The service was excellent, and so was the food.  Two of our steaks were slightly overcooked, but not worth complaining about because they tasted so good.  When the manager learned they wern't cooked to perfection he offered to bring two more steaks.  Because the steaks were almost eaten, two new steaks were declined.  They said the steaks were delicious even though slightly overcooked.  The manager ended up taking the two steaks off our bill...  Now that is excellent service....  Everything else was perfect.  We will definitely eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a date night. The place is very nice! Our server was very attentive and even complimented us on our attire. We were immediately seated and started looking at the menu. We had to go with the classic steak. We ordered medium rare and I must say it was delish! The steak literally melted in your mouth. I wasn't too impressed with their baked potato but overall it was a great experience! Plus it's inside the casino so we got to gamble for a little right after dinner."}
{"text":"Went to ditka's.... It was good. The food was wonderful.  Shrimp cocktail was perfect. Pork chop was wonderful. Burgers were great. Dessert tasty.  The chef is totally on the ball...  Unfortunately our waiter was horrible. One of our party arrived first, waited 10 min before approached! Beverages took forever, a beer was ordered 10 min later it arrived. Had to ask for bread. Waited 10-15 min to give dinner order. Had to ask for beverage refills. Gave the order he wrote it down.... Then we added a salad, which he did not write down....you guessed it, salad never came. The good thing was we weren't charged for it.  Thank goodness the meal was comped.... I would have been totally pissed if I had to pay the $100.25 bill with the waiter we had.  When your in an upscale restaurant you should NEVER have to ask for anything. (Period) no excuses. Good food, bad waiter. Would give 2.5 if possible for the food only. Take a chance... Eat in the bar area, dinner specials inn bar not available in dining room. My family usually eats in the bar and they say the waitstaff is great in the bar."}
{"text":"Try happy hour you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"There were five of us.  I only gave them 4 stars because service was slow.  There was only one other couple there.  Lobster bisque and the combo sliders were outstanding.   French onion soup very good.  Impressed how good things were.  We will return."}
{"text":"We have been here before, and in fact its our 3rd visit. The service this time has been the worst! We had to get the busboy to bring us our drinks. The servers were more occupied at their stations on their phones! When we inquired we were told that they had to help them close out a large party!!!! It was bullshit cause they werent more than 6 people!!!! At first they seemed to be swarmed but when you saw the amount of people, that wasnt possible!! Last time we will be here! Our group is usually 12, and believe me we would give ya business! Not at Ditkas!!"}
{"text":"Went for thanksgiving dinner here and I'm very thankful I got to celebrate thanksgiving at such an upscale restaurant, but unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.  The food was cold. The menu online did not reflect the menu in person. The server was very clumsy (dropping and spilling items) and absentminded (had to keep coming back to ask again what or how something was to be ordered. Or not remembering what was on the menu. The place had maybe four tables filled). Lastly I was charged $20 extra on my bill when I checked my bank statement. When I called to tell them of their error, they replied, \"oh sometimes that happens. We'll charge extra and then you'll see it fixed in a couple days.\"  Makes me wonder how often this happens to others."}
{"text":"We went to Ditka's for dinner before playing in the casino.  Not sure I would make the trek out there just for Ditka's, but since we wanted to go to a casino it worked out.    We had reservations at 615 and walked in and got seated right away.  Complimentary bread is served, it was good.  Food was really good.  I had the Da Coachs Meatloaf.  It was yummy and a lot of it!  Presentation was impressive.  My husband had the filet and crab medallions.  The filet was cooked perfectly medium rare.  The crab was flavored well.  Sides are purchased seperately.  We ordered the corn tamale cakes and we're not disappointed!!  They might have been my favorite part of the meal!    When we arrived our waitress asked if we were celebrating anything.  I told her it was my birthday.  After our meal I was presented with a slice of triple chocolate cake with a candle.  It was beautiful and delicious!  And a huge surprise!    Overall, the service was good, food was great, plus yummy birthday cake.  The prices were right in line for the quality of food we recieved.  We will eat there again if we are going to the casino."}
{"text":"We had the meatloaf which was really good! Nice dining area, it is separated from the casino so the smoke smell is not in the restaurant. Wait staff was very nice and service was good."}
{"text":"This review is hard to do because I love the 2 Ditkas in the Chicago area. The food was just not very good. Had the meatloaf and it was dry and not flavorful. We love the pot roast nachos in Chicago but here they were awful, little pot roast and served cold. Wife said her burger had no flavor.  This place is not worthy of the hall of fame coach!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am a easy grader but this restaurant is worth my 4 stars not 5 stars. First of all, when we walked in there is nobody at the front desk to great us.. AWEWARD.. for a $$$ restaurant (but we was over there like 8:15 pm if that matter). However,  after that everything is fine. Food is good we had a 20oz bone in ribeye, burgundy mushroom, corn tamales and steam asparagus... The server was attentive enough...Even though everything worked out fine but there is still something missing for this restaurant to be a fancy $$$ steakhouse. ."}
{"text":"This was my first time and probably last time at this restaurant. Overly priced for the food. They're trying too hard to be a nice steakhouse but can't even cook the steak right. I spent $40 for a New York strip medium rare, it came medium and charred all over. Tasted burnt. I've had $25 steak at longhorn and 5x better. The service was good at least. Our server was friendly and took excellent care of us as we were a big group. My friends roasted chicken was good but still a bit over priced for a piece of chicken. I love steak and I left wanting a real piece of meat. $40 for a dry piece of over cooked meat. I rather eat the gift shop"}
{"text":"Was completely let down by this place. My husband and I spent our valentines Day dinner here and wow where to start. First off upon approaching the restaurant the door man was so busy speaking to the hostess that he completely let the door close on my face. That wasn't a big deal to me. I can open a door right? Next we were seated the restraint it self is very nice the lighting white linen table clothes. Quite romantic. After our server took our drink order she said \"so are u guys here for that Valentine's day special\".... Nothing really harmful about those words but I think it would've been more appropriate to educate patrons on the special. we received salad. Two lobster tails two steak medalions. and my husband ordered the prime rib on the side. We also received mashed potatoes and asparagus. everything was either over cooked and under seasoned. just blan. blah blan. my favorite part of the meal... was the bread basket we. revieved. now I'm not some. snobby wife who has to have everything her way but I was let down. longhorns steakhouse has prepared a better. meal then ditkas. don't waste your money. or time"}
{"text":"Came in around 5 on Friday night 5/18.  We were a party of 9 and they were nice to accommodate and pulled tables together for us as we wanted to sit in the bar area. There were no other customers in the restaurant... and their service were inattentive and slooooow! We had to flag them down for everything from water refills to our bill. Wait staff were often standing in a group chatting. Food was ok but not impressive."}
{"text":"Un-be- lievable in every conceivable way. Food, service, atmosphere. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday last night.  The restaurant is out of the way and located inside of Vee Quiva casino.  However, the smell of stale smoke and sound of bells and whistles on slot machines do not carry into the establishment.  Definitely a plus.  The ambiance was very nice and relaxing.  The service was very pleasant and attentive.  There are some higher prices on the menu but the Coach's Hall of Fame trio cannot be beaten for the price.  I had the Delmonico steak with red mashed potatoes and asparagus and my with had double crusted filet red, red mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  Let me tell you that the red mashed potatoes are out of this world.  The steaks were tender and full of flavor.  The asparagus was crisp and perfect.  The crab bisque I had for a started was very creamy and full of flavor.  There was even chucks of crab in it lol.   We also had calamari. I have had better however, the breading on this was very light and they serve them as rings so it's calamari rings.  We ended our meals with desert.  My wife had the raspberry cheesecake which was a round, and high piece of cheesecake and bursted with flavor. They brought me out a creme brûlée with \"happy birthday\" written in cursive along the side of the plate and a candle burning in the center.  The server said they do not sing happy birthday there, and would leave it up to my wife to embarrass me.  Pictures are on my phone I will see if they can be uploaded later.    All in all dinner was phenomenal. When it was all said and done we spent $100 and that included tip.  Perfect amount for a lovely dinner.  Then you step out of the restaurant and back into the stale smoke smell of the casino.    We would definitely go back, however you have to be coming to gamble or something.  It is so far out of the way you would not just stop in per chance."}
{"text":"How convenient that you don't have wifi or service here. What a travesty. 1st my rare or blue as I asked for was (I'll be nice Medium Well). Then I get it as I asked for (with a very cold center) #learntocook #letthemeatrest  Thanks for making my birthday the best. I was already having a problem with your douchy bartender (sucks)  #youaretheslowestbartender and I know your kind.  I've been here before and the one in Chicago.  Unless I get lost in Laveen next time I will never be back! Good ridense to bad rubbish. The server \"Charles\" was great! Thank you.  You should get a job where people care about what they do."}
{"text":"Nothing  special  here besides  the  the name. The  waitress  wasn't  really  interested  in working  and the food  wasn't  good.  I had the rib 's and the birthday  cake tasted just like the box it came out of.  I give it two stars  just because  the place  has a  nice look but we came for the food."}
{"text":"Ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it came back at least well done. I brought up with the waiter and he said he would see what he could do. Came back 20 minutes later asking if everything was ok and if we wanted more drinks. He completely forgot about me."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, prices are reasonable, service is terrible! Slow as molasses, no one will make eye contact which makes it hard to get the attention of someone when in need. I am unclear as to if no one cares about the poor service or if no one sees they give bad service. Either way, it was not pleasant. I'd go back and try it again for the food. Perhaps I will update if better in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is straight up five stars, waitress could of been better, but I think she was new, food is really good"}
{"text":"Ok have been to this restaurant about 5 times.  The steaks have gotten progressively worse.  Texas Roadhouse is half the price and better quality steaks.  Do not recommend this place way overpriced"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times and our company Christmas party was held here.  The food is very good, the service is on point.  I think the only thing I have as a criticism is that the sides are priced separately so they aren't included with the meal.  Other than that, It's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"*** HAPPY HOUR REVIEW ONLY ***  We have been to Ditka's twice for happy hour and really enjoyed each visit! Both times the service was excellent, and most of the food was delicious - and an even better bargain!  Food. Almost all of their appetizers are available for $5, which is a significant discount as this is not a cheap place. Our favorites are the lightly-breaded, perfectly cooked calamari, bruschetta with brie and marinated tomatoes, and the beef sliders. We did not care for the roast beef nachos as the beef was slightly sweet, which we don't care for.   Beverages. The house Merlot and dark beer were both excellent - and a steal at $3.  Service. While the staff could have been snooty at us for making a meal out of their appetizers they were not - both were personable and very efficient. And the manager stopped by to check on us - a nice touch!   Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here so we just had appetizers but this was the worst service ever and I had calamari and it came out smelling so fishy I shouldn't have ate it but I did anyway and threw up all the way home this was the worst experience of my life"}
{"text":"Very nice place - friendly staff, attractive setting.  And like some reviewers have said - mixed feelings about the food. Four of us went last night.  Our friends both ordered the fried perch dinner and both thought it was excellent.  My wife and I ordered their featured burgers - medium rare.  The burgers came well done.  We sent them back, the manager came to our table to apologize (very apologetic about it) and the next two hamburgers came back medium well.   I must tell you, the manager checked back two more times and told us he was taking both burgers off the bill.  We were very impressed by his concern and reactions.  His name is Shane Driver and he is an excellent representative of Ditka's! Oh, the calamari appetizer - excellent!  Lightly breaded and cooked to perfection.  Same for the onion rings.  We will go back - just won't order burgers!"}
{"text":"Adrienne Scott waitress was absolutely horrible! She stood at the front at the hostesses booth gossiping about customers. She knew that my salad was soggy and frozen but she quickly stopped by our table avoiding the fact that I didn't touch my salad! Won't be eating here again ever!  Adrienne Scott is super lazy and should try a different career!"}
{"text":"We went for supper last night 09/25/2014 and we were really surprised because it was 5 stars for us. Showed up at 7, didn't have reservations and were seated right away. The atmosphere is very nice and surprisingly quiet...and no smell of smoke (we were seated in a booth).  Bread was served almost immediately with water. Our waitress (Sariah) recommended the Raspberry Smash for a cocktail, it was great and like she said...a little sweet but not too much. Hubby had the epicenter house beer said it was \"okay\".   Started with the fried calamari which was super crispy...this was not served by our waitress so we weren't given appetizer plates.  No prob, she came by, we asked and she brought them asap.   Then, cup of Lobster Bisque for me, If butter has a cousin...this is it. My husband had the french onion soup...super cheesy and the broth could be served in shot glasses.  For the entree: I had \"Da Pork Chop\" single and my husband \"Da Pork Chop\" double. Was cooked to perfection. Neither of us like overcooked pork...a little pink in the center please. I thought mine \"might\" be slightly over my personal preference since it's a single but no. (We had actually tried this at a cooking festival last summer and I obsessed over the cherry jus...I was not disappointed!) My husband picked the Charles Krug Cab to go with our meal...was perfect. There's a lot of flavors on the plate so the two go really well together.     We weren't going to have desert since we were both full (and had doggy bagged our meals) but yes...we shared the creme brulee. Good idea. It was a great ending to a super supper....crust was warm, crispy and tooth sticking and the custard was perfect temp (just slightly above room temperature)."}
{"text":"It was average at best.  I had the lake perch. The side dishes the rice pilaf and the coleslaw  were actually awesome. The servers were more interested in talking amongst themselves then to the customer. My experience was not great."}
{"text":"Who would have thought you could receive such fantastic service and have such delicious food at a casino in Arizona. Lesson learned, you can. We stayed at the Vee Quiva resort and opted to eat at Ditka's  for dinner. At first glance of the menu, it looked a by pricey but because it was closed off from the cigarette smoke of the casino (unlike the other food options) we decided to have a seat. I am thankful we did. My brother had the chicken entree and couldn't stop raving. I had the French onion soup an a wedge salad, and my mom and I split the filet sliders. None of us were the least bit disappointed. And too top it off the service was wonderful. The general manager stopped by a few times to make sure we were enjoying our experience and the chef even stopped by to see what we thought. I have to say, if you are looking for a night out, take a ride down to Vee Quiva and enjoy dinner at Ditka's. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"my wife and i made reservation for ditka's on 3-27-15 at 5:30 pm.  we don't go to casinos often and this was our fist time in vee quiva.  we arrived a couple minutes early and it took the staff about 5 minutes to seat us.  we were on of the first guest to arrive.the hostess staff were friendly.  our server was very helpful with the menu and that made our experience all the better.  as far as food goes i'll be honest and the best part of our whole dining experience was indulging in the corn tamale cake!!!  holy batman!  we ordered the \"kick ass\" paddle steak 20 oz ribeye steak, bbq babyrack ribs with a side of corn tamale cake.  for drinks we ordered an arnold palmer and lemonade.  we ordered a triple chocolate cake for dessert.  the ribeye was 4 star and the ribs were 4.5 star and the cake was 5 star and the corn tamale cake was 10 star.  the food was above average and reasonable priced.  our meal for 2 adults before tip was $92.  the service was above average.  i got the feeling like i was not in a fancy steak house.  not sure why.  but overall we had a great experience.  i would definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"To be honest, I ate at Ditka's tonight to meet Da Coach. But I left pleasantly surprised at the food and service. The salad, bone-in pork chop, and wine were tasty.  Our server was genuinely friendly and very helpful. Needless to say, meeting Mr. Ditka was a thrill!  He actually meets with each table, takes time with everyone, signs items, and takes pictures. Class act. My experience at Ditka's was truly awesome.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"We ordered the Prime rib and the King Crab legs, Mike's salad, and baked tater.  All was very good.  The Prime Rib could have been seasoned better but the meat was very tender.  It is over priced especially the wines by the glass.  I ordered the Ditka \"Icon\" cabernet and it was $18.  I could buy a better bottle for that price. The service we had was excellent.  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable on the menu.  We saw the stacked meat loaf with mashed potatoes and onion rings on top it was huge and looked like awesome.   I am sure it's a heart attack on a plate but I am ordering it next time just to give it a go.  They also have Ditka Chop (pork Chop) that is a popular item.  We had coupons from the casino so our meal was half price. That was a great thing."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service. I had the NY strip it was cooked a little under what I ordered but still very good. The wifey had twin filet cooked to perfection. Definitely will be coming back, thank you Melissa"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at this place.   We sat at the bar and ordered ribeye steak and double stuffed potato.   The steak was delicious. Cooked exactly right medium.  Was very hot, flavorful.   Double stuffed potato was also very good.   Salad was excellent.   Honestly, overall I am very much surprised. I expected a standard steakhouse but they exceeded my expectations on every level. The service was prompt and they were very polite.   I will be back for sure.   Good job, Ditka's."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago and have eaten at Ditka's out there many times. It is a great place, wonderfully formal but comfortable atmosphere, and when you take a bite of your steak you understand why you paid $50 just for the meat. Sadly, none of this applies to Ditka's out here in Phoenix. The fact that it is in a casino isn't terrible. But it is only a glass wall separating you and the slot machines eating pensioners life savings. It does nothing to block out the noise either. Then you have servers with spiked hair and large ear gauges. That's fine if I'm at an Applebee's, but not a supposedly formal steakhouse. The \"formal\" part of this is completely wiped out by the lack of any dress code. No requirement for at least a button up shirt. I had the pleasure of a large man in a very dirty jersey sitting at the table next to me. But all this pails in the quality of the steak. Just like Chicago you are paying $50+ just for a steak so you know it has to be good, right? Wrong. My girlfriend and I had to refuse these dry, grissly, flavorless hunks of roadkill. These \"things\" made a Denny's t-bone taste like Aphrodite herself was pouring ambrosia down your throat. Heartbroken is the most appropriate description I can give. The best steak I have ever had was at Ditka's in Oakbrook, IL. The worst was at Ditka's in Laveen, AZ."}
{"text":"Sports bar turned classy joint. Steve the bartender MAKES this place. He was a GEM! So nice and helpful :)"}
{"text":"Great food ant excellent service!  Ask for Charles for your server!  Fish and chips on Fridays is excellent!  Deserts are just the right size too!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the service was really s...l...o...w......  Not the fault of the wait staff, they were overloaded.  When we came into the restaurant the hostess asked if we had reservations, which of course we did not.  There were no walk-ins being taken in the dining room, but we were welcome to sit and order from the bar area.  In theory, this was good, in reality all the overflow from the restaurant dining room now fell on the hapless bar staff.  For the quality of the food the prices were reasonable, and there were selections on the menu from just over $10.00 all the way up to $60.00 or more.  Drink refills were slow in coming, our food did arrive cooked perfectly and hot, but any other attention was rare.  It took over 15 minutes to get our bill settled.   So, make reservations or be prepared to wait.  I think Ditka's is a real nice place to eat in that part of the valley."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I made reservations for 2 for 5pm. They waited until 5:11 to open the doors. The place was empty. No problem. However, my Filet medallions with shrimp scampi were overdone. The shrimp was hard and chewy and the Filet was well done, not medium. For the price, I expected much better."}
{"text":"So i had looked at the menu ahead of time, and my husband and I were going for a 10th anniversary, my husband was going to get the prime rib and I thought I would get the Southern Fried Chicken. The Southern Fried Chicken is not on the menu it's an error on the menu my husband's prime rib was okay but not great but my chicken which ended up being chicken piccata was dry and overcooked. We did get a lovely piece of cake for our 10th anniversary which was complimentary of ditkas, but would we go back again probably not"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Ditkas. I had Prime Rib and it was cooked to perfection and just really delicious, as was the asparagus and potatoes.  They had a few good craft beers and I also enjoyed that and the desert was a chocolate cake with a raspberry drizzle... always a great combo, but the quality is key. Everything was really good quality. A very enjoyable meal and the service was fantastic too."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. For a casino steakhouse the prices are very reasonable. As far as the food not very good. I'm not sure if the chef taste the food when it comes out but he or she should start! Cocktail sauce that come out with our seafood tower was over powering with horseradish, which is a understatement. If you have a clogged nose I suggest having some. It will clear that right up. The one thing I will say is the waitress did tell us that there was a lot of horseradish in it. I figured ok a little bite to it I prefer it like that, but whoa you couldn't eat it! The ahi tuna looked and tasted a little suspect. They did substitute some shrimp for it. Crab legs are split and cold. Problem is think they keep them on ice. The bottom part of the crab was literally frozen. Ok on to soup and salad. Prob best part of the meal. Entrees there was 4 of us 2 of us are pretty picky so surprise surprise of course we didn't like it. But the 2 that weren't didn't like there's either. Prime rib was tuff not like a prime rib should be. Even the au jus came out luke warm at best and flavorless. Fish had no flavor. One got NY Strip and asked for Med-well (which I think ruins it). That came out charred on the outside and med-rare. The sides weren't even good. Asparagus overcooked and way to much lemon. The \"smashed\" red potatoes temp wise were closer to the cold side with no flavor. I will say the service wasn't terrible and the manager did take his time to stop by and talk with us. Overall wouldn't bother wasting my time there nor would I suggest you waste your time or money, even if the casino is going to comp it!"}
{"text":"Honestly if you're coming here for appetizers do not bother they are in such a small quantity that you could have gotten six times the size at fat burger and the naturals are seriously the size of a tostada"}
{"text":"I've visited Ditkas before, so I knew what to expect. I've never had a bad meal here and they have a fantastic selection of whiskeys and wines. We sat at the bar ready to eat, drink and watch the Gold Cup soccer match. The bartender seemed lost and disinterested in what we wanted. She had 3 customers seated and took her time bringing a menu and searching for the game for us. After 10 minutes of this we left. If I return and she's behind the bar, I'm not going to waste my time again"}
