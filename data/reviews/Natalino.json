We sat outside on the terrace overlooking the water with soft music playing in the background, incredibly romantic !!! this is my new go to restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant, if you are looking for delicious food, wonderful staff great service and want to feel as though you're in Italy along the Mediterranean Sea, this the place to go !!  Thank you Natalino for making my evening very memorable."}
{"text":"Nous y avons mangé samedi passé. Très bon repas, bonne portions. Les serveurs et serveuses très sympatiques. Agréablement surpris, à quelques kilomètres de l'aéroport.  Nous y retournerons."}
{"text":"Where is the 10-star option? We arrived on a cross-country flight to Montreal at 11 PM (en route to our home in Vermont) after the hotel restaurant was closed and were given a take-out menu for what looked like a greasy-spoon pizza place. We Yelped and found Restaurant Natalino, which was about to close. To our delight, the owner/manager (?) took our order and agreed to deliver to us -- even though the hotel was farther than he realized. Above and beyond service with a delightful delivery guy AND THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! We split Caesar salad (fresh, crisp) and chicken Parmesan with pasta and vegetables. And good Italian rolls. We've decided we're going to drive back up from Vermont just to go to the restaurant. Well, not tomorrow, but what a great experience. Thank you from two hungry and satisfied traveling customers."}
{"text":"This place needs more reviews - I am the fourth.  I had a decent meal here while in town for my company.  I might not have stumbled on this restaurant if it hadn't been for a coworker who ate here previously.  It is basically an old house near the water (is that a lake or a river across the street?) converted to a restaurant.  They can host groups on the second floor.  We ate downstairs and it was pretty dead for a Wednesday night during winter,  I sense that they may be busier during the summer/warmer months.  The overall theme is italian and they have several varieties from the \"boot\" of Europe.  They have different variations of red sauce, plus olive oil treatments, with different pastas.  They offer chicken, veal, seafood and steaks.  Oh and they offer pizzas, which we decided to share a pizza (they are personal sized) and then have entrees.  The server brought a \"free\" appetizer of small sliced bread with melted cheese and tomato sauce on it.  I don't know when these were made, but after one bite I wasn't going to spoil my dinner with this free offering.  I had a glass of the house Chianti, which was quite flavorful.  However, the second glass I ordered with my meal tasted quite a bit different - a bit musty.  I asked our server - nicely - if it was the same bottle, or even the same wine.  I think I flustered him because he stammered out \"bien sur\" (of course).  Beyond the margarita pizza, I had a fettuccine with gigi sauce.  It really was the highlight of the meal.  The pasta seemed fresh and the server said it was homemade.  I can't say I would make this an out of the way stop, but I don't recall many other choices in this area of the Island of Montreal.  I feel this place strives for something better."}
{"text":"Had two different homemade pastas and was disappointed. Very very salty and nothing special about the pasta itself. Mussels were a bit old."}
{"text":"This is my dad's favourite place to eat. I've been here a number of times over the last decade with him. If you're looking for a good meal in Dorval and you like Italian food this is the place to go. It's a quaint little restaurant off of Lakeshore where the service is great and the pasta is delicious. They offer half plates of pasta which is a desirable option for me because I can never eat an entire plate to myself."}
{"text":"Great ital food and service. I am a chef and travel extensively.  My best meal in Montreal through 3 trips. Pasta al dente. Wonderful bread."}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant,on mangent très bien et un service impeccable,la nourriture super bonne peu importante le choix de notre plats.Merci de votre accueillent ."}
