{"text":"I've only been there for breakfast, which was great.  I love their pecan waffles, and my husband likes their omlets.  The portiions are more than enough and the wait staff was very prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time.  Had a terrific breakfast along with great, friendly service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I would go back to this place ! The food was good and the service was great. Didn't wait long for my food and the breakfast was the bomb!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved west from Lakewood, and we were looking for somewhere for a good Sunday breakfast. We came across this on Yelp, and we were not disappointed. Good portions and good food. The wait staff couldn't be more pleasant and the customers were down to earth."}
{"text":"Just passing thru on long road trip. Food was delicious! Service quick and friendly. Prices excellent. Definitely a good place to stop"}
{"text":"I've taken way too much time to write this review. Not often do I visit for breakfast but it's always great. I asked for my eggs over medium, my wife requesting over easy. Both were done correctly.

Usually I'm there in the evening when 3/4 of the time I get grilled pork chops. They're always tender and nicely seasoned. Try their soups, different each day and always home made.

Ambiance... well, it is a diner. But it is neat and clean. Booths on the sides, tables in the middle, and they're happy to pull tables together for a larger group. Service is friendly and attentive, and Tom demonstrates pride of ownership."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My boyfriend lives nearby and has never been so we decided to check it out. The omelets and waffles were delicious. The portions are large and filling. I highly recommend City Diner for a quick, inexpensive, and tasty breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a great price. We had a wonderful lunch on our trip through North Ridgeville. Jessica was incredible to all of us, but especially made our children feel welcome. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I struggle with the 5 stars.  Not because it is not deserving, but it might bring more people here and the secret will be out.

I can only speak for breakfast which is AWESOM.  Our server Allison was amazing.  Extremely friendly and helpful. 

I had corned-beef hash, two eggs, biscuit and home fries.  The hash was some of the best I have had, and I love hash.  Wife had biscuits and gravy and it too was fantastic.

This is simply one of the best experiences I have had in a while.  So glad we stopped."}
{"text":"Six of us had breakfast here on Memorial Day. Pancakes, sausages, omelettes, and coffee. 
When one of our party requested an egg white omelette, the waitress came back from the kitchen and said they couldn't do an egg white omelette because of the holiday. (?)
When we objected, she went back and then said they would accommodate our request. 
One of us found the pancakes \"chewy,\" but my fried eggs and hashbrowns were just as you would expect.
When my three year old asked for a pancake with a face, the waitress brought back a pancake with a whipped cream smiley face. 
Just your average neighborhood diner I guess, which is just what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant for years. Breakfast is always great and very fair priced. Service is outstanding and very friendly place to eat.  Their dinner selection is very good and again fair price.  You cannot go wrong with this restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had low expectations when I arrived but this place truly impressed me! 

I had the Italian sausage with marinara sauce and the cheesy fries as a starter. Both were incredibly delicious. 

I would have given them 5/5 but the soda (diet coke) was terrible :("}
{"text":"Yay! Stopped by for the first time with an old friend. We both had the chicken Marsala and I must say it is perhaps the best I've ever had. It was tender, juicy, and the Marsala sauce was excellent. Our salads were fresh and tasty. I live about 30 minutes away but I will definitely be back! I wish we had this diner in Amherst!"}
{"text":"Went Friday for the fish fry.  It appeared they were baked not fried.  The fish were very thin therefore had no flavor because there was no flesh.  I gave it a 3 star as the servers are always nice. The soup was tasty.  Have been there before the best meal they serve is breakfast."}
{"text":"My family eats at City Diner 2-3 times a month.  I would say that it has more of a neighborhood family restaurant feel to it than a diner, as its name would suggest. 

The food is above average and the portions are generous. Prices are reasonable and they have specials that are usually a very good value. They have had a $9.99 steak special that is a great deal. The steak was somewhat under-seasoned but not bad considering that I don't think that I could have made one at home for that price. 

The service has always been good. The servers are friendly. Food comes out of the kitchen very quickly. Usually this would cause alarm for me because it makes me think that everything is precooked and that they just reheat it when you order, but somehow they pull it off. Breakfast is especially fast (as it should be). I once ordered breakfast and then went to the restroom to wash my hands. When I returned to my table, my food was already sitting there! 

The whole restaurant is clean including the restrooms. I have seen several employees cleaning various areas of the restaurant when they were not busy."}
{"text":"This place is your standard American diner with decent food at a decent price. It has the feel of a nursing-home cafeteria, just because of the majority of the clientele in that area. My biggest downside as a vegetarian is that I have literally two menu options: spaghetti (not the meat sauce please, and no meatballs), or standard breakfast-fare (eggs, pancakes, can I switch the bacon for a different side). My fiance enjoys their burgers and other meat-dishes. Overall, we come here if we're too lazy to cook and the pizza shops aren't open yet. Note that they close ridiculously early (like 6 or 7pm), so even though they \"serve dinner,\" it's more intended for your grandparents who dine at 4pm so they can hit the hay by 7."}
{"text":"This is for breakfast. Pancakes are great. The blueberries are fresh - not sugary canned stuff!! Waitress was 5 star. Clean and open areas to eat."}
{"text":"Very nice place very clean great service I have a hamburger with fries my wife had the meatloaf both were very good. very well seasoned. will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"The owner Tom is great and the waitresses are the best! Come on Tom give them a raise. Your food is the best !"}
{"text":"Nice place for a simple American breakfast. Taking off 1 star because they always have Fixed News on the televisions."}
{"text":"I like this place, a friendly neighborhood restaurant, not pretentious, good food, good prices, not crowded.  Been here for lunch many times: make sure to check the specials. The style is American food, the wait staff is friendly, and it has music playing, but quiet enough to talk.
Not a \"destination\" restaurant for impressing your date, but a good place to have lunch with friends"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem of N Ridgeville. Very clean and good food. Good staff. And decent bar. This place should do more biz then it gets. Had the country fried steak and eggs for Sunday breakfast. Best breakfast in town. Good prices."}
{"text":"Very nice diner / family restaurant, with a decent variety of no-nonsense  tasty grub that is served hot and quickly, and is much less expensive than the ripoff national chains.  The service staff is friendly and efficient to boot.  I learned a long time ago that you can always rely on locally run diners for affordable, quality food with good portions to satisfy the belly!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive... good service... good food... cant really ask for more!
check out the chicken parm and spaghetti or the chicken romano pasta. delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the reviews as I'm coming from out of town. Everything was okay, the interior is multifunctional with a bar near the front."}
{"text":"Friendly service and really good server. The owner comes to the tables asking how everything is. So many choices for breakfast and great prices. The portions are generous and the place is packed. I chose cheese omelette with mozzarella cheese  and came with toast and home fries. Husband chose corned beef and Swiss cheese omelette with home fries and toast. Would definitely recommend this diner is you are in North Ridgevile area. We live in summit county and both love to venture out"}
{"text":"Very low quality breakfast.  Not sure how this place averages so many stars.  I would rather make this breakfast in like 10 minutes at home."}
