{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on a weekend and the place is pretty nice. The place was pretty small but done up quite nice. I ordered the carbonara which was really good. I haven't eaten at a ton of pasta places in Toronto yet but I am definitely a fan of this place.  I don't know the name of the waiter I got but based on the other reviews it is probably the same person. The guy is really chatty and incredibly nice. He did a great job of having a long conversation with one of the other people eating at the restaurant and was also good about looping me into it."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service! Loved our waiter Larry and Loved our evening."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss but the food is amazing. They serve delicious Italian food with super fresh ingredients. Maybe the best pasta I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went there for the Thurs/Fri 2 for 1 Prix Fixe special.  The place reminded us of some little mom and pop restaurant that you'd find in the country somewhere.  Cute small dining room, talkative staff and food that really tasted home made.  Unfortunately we were in downtown Toronto where there is lots of competition, so it was a bit harder to look past the faults.  Wine glasses that were quite dusty, wine that somehow seemed to be above room temperature, meat and cheese plate that didn't come with any bread and then to top it all off, the bill came with tax and 15% gratuity already added to the full price, and then the price of one dinner subtracted by hand at the end. The table beside us of 4 had to call Larry over twice to get him to explain it so they could try and figure it out between the 4 of them.  Having it all automatically added on for just the two of us seemed underhanded and ended with the meal costing us a fair bit more than we were expecting. With all of the other options around, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Foccacia is located in the Yonge and Bloor area. Upon first entering the restaurant, you feel a little bit like it's a candidate for the show 'Restaurant Makeover' - the space is small and the decor is quite plain and a bit on the worn side. However, I'm not going to judge a place based solely on decor.   When we arrived the restaurant, it was about 60% full (maybe 15 people). There was one waiter - Larry who was looking after all the tables. Larry was quite the character like previous reviewers have described - he was talkative, friendly and seemed to know a few of the customers. However, he was quite unhappy with the number of Groupon customers in the establishment and wasn't shy about letting people know. Clearly the restaurant had oversold on Groupons and even though it knew about the number of customers, they did not bother to have more than one waiter on staff. We waited quite a while for menus, drinks and it was hard to get Larry's attention because he was looking after so many tables. A nearby table did not have a Groupon voucher and they appeared to get bigger portions and more attention from the waiter. Clearly is the restaurant was not going to use the opportunity to use Groupon as a way of attracting new customers.   The food itself was nothing to write home about. I ordered the Penne Pollo and my friend ordered Spaghetti aglio e olio. Sadly the portions were no bigger than something you'd get a food court establishment like Piazza Manna and not even close to being better. There were a few pieces of chicken in my bowl and my friend received about 5 thin slices of sausage on his. The kicker was that they seemed to be using dry pasta and the Parmesan cheese we were offered wasn't fresh - think of the stuff from Kraft you buy in the pasta isle at a supermarket. The flavours of our dishes were bland - no detectable spices or flavours to make the dishes interesting.   I doubt very much I will be returning to Foccacia, I just can't find a reason to. There are other places in the city that are adequately staffed and serve better (tastier) foods. Heck, Jack Astors up the street has a pasta dishes for the same price, the portions are bigger and they're rarely short staffed."}
{"text":"Like others, we used a $20 groupon for two that includes two salad/soup and two pasta dishes. The restaurant was empty on a Thursday night. The service was decent.  Both of us had Cesar salad as the starter, for entree we had the shrimp Alfredo fettuccine and spicy sausage spaghetti.  Salad was ok, the Alfredo fettuccine was too oily and heavy for me. The spaghetti was very appealing and tasty!!  For the price, the outcome was decent. If I want a quick Italian meal next time, I would go again for sure (if the Groupon is still active)."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon (2 course dinner for 2 for $20).  The waiter/matre'd is very friendly, but, unfortunatley, the food is, at best, so-so.  The menu is dull: saladas for first course and past for second.  My past was way over-cooked - a definite no-no in an Italian restaurant. My wife's pasta with eggplant parmigiana was just not very good (a strange combination also).  Even chain Italian places will do a better job.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I love their lamb!! It tastes so good. But I don't like the fact that they serve minute mate orange juice...at least serve tropicana!.....  I think they have specials now on Thursdays and Fridays(buy one get one free, i think...) So try to go there on a friday:)"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting this restaurant for the last nine years, the first time being when our daughter was six years old.  With many restaurants in this area being geared more to a young single clientele, it wasn't easy finding one that welcomed children while still having great food and a quiet ambiance.  Bill the owner and Larry the manager/waiter always make us feel at home.  We have been here countless times and are never disappointed.  Delicious food, friendly and attentive service, and an unpretentious warmth are what make Focaccia our favourite restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Business closed even though inside business hours!  I attempted to go to this restaurant twice to use a Groupon. Both times the business was closed, even though their website and the phone automated machine confirmed that it was supposed to be open. Horrible experience considering the walk to this restaurant is 30 minutes both ways in the freezing cold!"}
{"text":"So underwhelmed. So.  Upon finding this little hideaway I'd been pretty excited; it had the trappings of a hidden gem, and the waiter was plenty jolly. The appetizer salads were pretty decent, but upon trying the pastas, my friend and I deflated with that sad, slow fffffffshhhhhh of helium balloons with the air let out. The fettucine alfredo we each observed to be like mac n cheese with overcooked (to the point where the pasta is mushy and clumps together) fettucine, and the so-called carbonara was, in my friend's words, a sort-of-Italian take on cheap dry, chow mien with no noticeable cheese or cream and sad bits of egg. Even the bacon in it wasn't very good (and that, my friends, is very. sad).  The pastas are priced at $15-16, but I don't know if I even would pitch $4 for a plate of that quality. It was on par with mediocre buffet food. My only caveat is that I've been here once, so maybe the food is just completely inconsistent (I cannot imagine how it has positive ratings otherwise). I'll give a couple sad stars (like my sad food) for the service and the OK apps though.  Disappointed. Will not be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night, staying at the Marriott Bloor-we were looking for a nearby Italian restaurant, not over priced. This place was great! The waiter was warm funny and entertaining from the moment we stepped inside!! His name is Larry. The food was delicious too!"}
{"text":"The food at this place has always been great.  Been there several times, and the food is always delicious...prepared by the tiny kitchen you can see from your table.  Always really interesting soups and sides, and the mains are delicious as well.  I'm not sure if it recently changed owners or management, but they've made some big changes sometime in the last few months that make me like this place even more.            Larry no longer works there, and while he was a nice guy, he was too talkative for my ideal dining service.  I avoided going to this place because it was difficult to talk to my friends/family because Larry kept interjecting.              They also expanded their menu slightly, adding several pasta dishes, and fixed up the interior.  It used to be kind of dark and gloomy, but they've really brightened the place up.  It still has a small intimate feel, but no longer feels like a cave."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a Wednesday. Unless you sorta knew this place existed before coming, you might totally miss out on it since its located in a small nook. Really homey atmosphere! The server greeted us with complimentary bread accompanied with olive topping.  The food was good, especially for the price. We had the Spaghetti Carbonara and the Linguini Pescatore. $15 for a plate was totally worth it considering that the portions were just right, and the taste was on point."}
{"text":"I came here with some out of town coworkers last night.    I ordered the spaghetti carbonara.  It was average.  There wasn't much bacon, taste was a bit bland and the pasta itself wasn't thend greatest.  It reminded me a bit of pasta I get at chains such as Jack Astors or Kelsey's.  I'm not sure if it was made in house, but it didn't taste or feel like it though.  The dish was around $15 I believe and if it were my money and not the company's,  I might have been more annoyed.    There are a few saving graces though: -Service is nice -We had some sausage and calimari as the apps and both of these were delicious.  Verdict: I'm not super impressed by this place and they need to step up their game as there are plenty of fine Italian restaurants in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon and try this restaurant. Food is pretty. Service is very good. Just the atmosphere isn't what I expected. Maybe not enough people here. Overall it was good."}
{"text":"The place is really small, but I like ambience. Really good for chatting and drinking wine.  Food was okay, we had 18$ set menu that we upgraded to Caesar salad instead of house salad, so we paid 2$ more. But for 18$ you really got a lot of food, really worth it( 1 appetizer and 1 main course). I had penne pollo along with my Caesar salad.  Service was okay. You do have to let them know ahead if you want to use Groupon though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and a groupon.   The place is a cute little restaurant near construction (what isn't near construction in Toronto). I wasn't expecting too much from this place considering it was from a groupon.  I was blown away.  Caprese Salad. was my starter salad. It was tasty with lots of flavor from the cheese and dressing.    For the main, I forgot the menu item, but it was a calamari pasta. It was creamy and it was a good portion just for lunch.  The server was also really nice and attentive. The ambiance could of been better, it is a bit empty in the restaurant. I still think this place deserves a 5/5 for their effort though.   I would definitely come back for lunch if I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"I've been to Focaccia several times now. (It's the sister restaurant to Bloom, another favourite place of mine.) The place is tucked away on Hayden St, in what looks to be an old house. The dining room is fairly small and cozy. (There is a larger dining area up stairs for private functions.)  The service is great. The host is always (as far as I can tell) Larry, an (incredibly) friendly waiter. If you don't like having conversations with the wait staff at places you go, then this might be a place to avoid. The food is Latin American and sort of Italian in style. I've always been impressed with what i've had. The menu changes with some frequency. Prices are pretty reasonable for a place of this caliber. They also serve brunch, which is pretty fucking awesome. The place is probably worth going to if only to try brunch there. (Picadillo empanada Chilean style FTW!)"}
{"text":"I used to work in the area and had lunch here at least once a week!! The owners are so nice and very friendly!! The restaurant is a small intimate setting and a good spot for a nice dinner date. The chicken meatballs are SO delicious! They have awesome sandwiches and rose pasta as well."}
{"text":"Focaccia is a tiny little restaurant just south of Yonge and Bloor. The Restaurant is family run. Just looking at the chef (who they call Papa) and speaking to him, I knew the food would be traditional Italian food. I went into the establishment and it made me think small business. When I see a small businesses I think about all of the older generations that have worked hard to provide a better future for their family. I sincerely believe Papa was part of a family that is a prime example of that.  When I came in Papa greeted me politely and sat me down. He provided me with a menu and fresh bread with tapenade. He then brought me a house salad for an appetizer. Kinda glad he chose that over the Caesar salad since you can't trust romaine these days. Finally I received my Spaghetti Aglio e Olio which was spaghetti with sausage and rapini. The pasta was al dente and perfect. Kinda wished it had more of a sauce to it though.  Jordi (owner's half brother) stepped in half way into my main course and cheerfully greeted all of the guests. We had a nice chat and he verified that it was a family owned restaurant and mentioned I should visit the sister restaurant Bloom. I will come back and visit this family owned restaurant and probably will head over to Bloom as well. JimStar Out!!!"}
{"text":"It's always nice to find a restaurant gem based on others'  online reviews. Staying at the Marriot Bloor-Yorkville, we  wanted something within a short walk and had Italian on our  minds. Soon to be dwarfed by a high-rise accross the street, if  you didn't have the address  you might walk by.  A small, but  cozy dining room was staffed by Larry who was both courteous  and social. Mona was in the kitchen, producing perfect pasta  dishes, with steak and chicken also on the menu. There are very  reasonable bottles of wine available, so why buy just a glass?  We both opted for the Caesar salad which was fresh with a  light, not overpowering dressing. Save room for desert, as  there are some nice specials; we shared banana ice cream over  chocolate cake. We'll definately go back on our next Toronto  visit."}
{"text":"Had an awkward experience at the start as the front door was locked when we came at 5:45pm on a Monday evening. Then the cook spotted us and started to slowly approach the door to open it for us after a good 10minutes of us standing outside and exchanging looks. The server apparently did not come in until after 6pm, so we waited with the cook until he arrived. When the waiter finally arrived, we were supposedly given the wrong menu. Larry, the waiter, was nice but seemed unprepared when he had to rush to serve us and change into his uniform in the middle of dinner. Restaurant said it was open 11:30-9pm, I couldn't imagine what would happen if we came at 5.    Bread was offered with a chickpea, parsley, and tomato dip, which was surprisingly refreshing (and i don't usually like hummus!). We ordered the caesar salad and the lentil soup which were both mediocre, but our expectations were not high at this point.   For entrees, we ordered the spicy sausage rapine spaghettini and the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp. The spicy sausage pasta was delicious but the fettuccine was quite bland/oily and lacked a shrimp or ten.  All in all, with the groupon it was worth the meal, but would not pay more for the quality of our experience as the restaurant needs to be more organized."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to this restaurant. We went here after a friend raved about this place. I've been to many Italian restaurants so my expectations are high. What I found here was basic Italian food done poorly. I ordered the veal parmigiana and found it to be unnecessarily greasy. I would have liked it better had it not been swimming in oil.  From the time we stepped foot in the restaurant to the time we left the waiter talked to us non stop. I can basically write a book about his life story. However he didn't even seem to know the menu. We were the only ones in the restaurant which is indicative of the demand for what it has to offer. I was paying someone else would walk in just do we would be left alone by the waiter.  I don't mean to bash this restaurant by any means. Just wanted to share MY experience. My friends actually liked this place but again I've been to many Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"Our group of six had a great experience. We booked to go before going to the theatre. All of our meals were excellent, and served in short order. Larry our waiter was great, very entertaining. It is a small place but was full by 7pm."}
{"text":"Mom and Pop shop feel, great food and awesome takeout specials! (Pasta all for $10) great deal when I want a hearty dinner or lunch!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with an offeron coupon and had a great time!  Friendly service by a very chatty waiter named Larry.  He was super nice and I enjoyed his friendly conversation.  He was helpful in regards to the menu and wine options.  We ordered the salmon and chicken supreme and both were great, my salmon was amazing.  We were too full for dessert but i would've had one  otherwise.  Overall a nice little restaurant with good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant. Food is delicious and our server was very attentive. Will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"unassuming tiny place, easy to miss if walking by, but don't! Simple menu and extremely fresh.All 4 of us had something different and agreed outstanding food."}
