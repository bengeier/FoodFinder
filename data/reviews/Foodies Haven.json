{"text":"Awesome Filipino food place! After mountain biking ride at South Mountain, me and my friends decided to give it a try and eat there. Majority tried the topsilog (pork tocino and eggs). but I was starving so I went for a real meal...2 entree combo for $7. I had this mongo and dinuguan. The mongo was freshly cooked...with leafy veggies...pleasant savory taste . I would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Really? Menudo and Adobo puro matamis. They put sugar on everything? Please don't do that. You can not put sugar in all your recipes !   This is the second time that I have been there and I have not yet found a reason to be impressed.  Banana fritter ( Turon) was mostly wrapper.   I will give your resto another try one of these days. I like supporting local business.   Please give me reason to NOT stop coming back.  Thanks - Veronica"}
{"text":"This was literally the very best place to get Filipino food, and they were only open for less than a year. I don't know why the best Filipino places closed down so soon. Everybody who eats Filipino food, they go to the worst places. Like halo halo kitchen in Glendale, or that at my place café in Mesa. At my place Café used to be manila sunrise gourmet, and that was literally my favorite Filipino restaurant that has ever existed here in the Phoenix Valley. I'm so tired of the great Filipino restaurants closing down. I wish one with just open up, and stay open forever. One that will give you a lot of food for good prices, and with the best service. Foodies Haven was definitely top-tier."}
{"text":"This place is always closed at erratic times and they never pick up their phone. They've completely lost my business at this point. Three days in a row I have tried to contact them before I make the drive over there and no one picks up the phone. Good luck with your business!"}
{"text":"Some of my Filipino friends have been constantly raving about Foodies Haven nonstop for a month so I decided it was time to check it out.  I went during my lunch break on a Monday early afternoon and it was pretty empty with the exception of 2 other customers.  I quickly scanned the food they had available and went with one of my favorite Filipino dishes, Dinaguan.  I'll save you the culture shock and leave out the description of what is in the dish, but it's a huge Filipino staple and a very common dish.  I figured it would be a good dish for me to compare against other Filipino restaurants in the valley since I'm pretty picky with the flavoring of this dish. I must say they absolutely nailed it!  I quickly finished my meal within 10 minutes (and I'm a slow eater) because it was so scrumptious!  By the time I was cleaning up and ready to leave the restaurant was getting pretty packed.  And not with just Filipinos!  All different races were coming in which made me pretty happy for the owners.  Go local businesses!"}
{"text":"Awesome food,  they had traditional filipino dishes like bopice and dinyaguan and the pancit palabok were the bomb!!! I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Foodies Haven. I didn't know about it until I asked siri for directions to the nearest Filipino restaurant. I was craving Filipino breakfast. The longanisilog hit the spot. Delicious! Also, after finding out they have sisig and the cook is from Pampanga, I will be back. I can't wait to try more items. I went back for lunch and brought friends. Very disappointed. They were out of many things listed on Today's Specials. They didn't take order clearly and missed part of it. Disorganized. Not well run. Pancit bihon just ok. Lumpia was good. Out of lechon kawali. Crispy pata was bad. Philippine bbq was just ok.  I will not go back. I'll drive the extra 20 miles to go to Halo Halo Kitchen where I've never had a bad thing."}
{"text":"Very good flavors! On our first visit we ordered crispy pata, sisig, pork bbq on a stick, spaghetti, turon and lechón kawali. Everything tasted like home to me.   It's a small place, and there's not a whole lot of food options but the ones I picked were perfect!   Make sure you get their atchara. Delish!"}
{"text":"Great new Filipino joint!  Prices are very low and the portions very large.  The food was wonderful as well as the owners.  I had the lechon kawali, pancit palabok, and the lumpia and it all tasted awesome.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"$5 combination plates. Wow what a deal! I'm not sure if this is truly a foodie's haven but they do give you large portions for a fair price.   This tiny little hole in the wall offers a small selection of Filipino favorites. Most of the food will be preprepared in trays and you pick out what up want. When we came here there were about 6 items available in the serving trays. Dishes seem to rotate on a daily basis so each time you are here there will be a different menu. When we went we had 4 out of the 6 available: dinuguan, pancit, lumpia, and sinigang. The food looked like it had been sitting in the trays all day so I tried to steer clear of anything that might not keep well over time.  Each plate comes with a mound of rice and the portions were very generous. The lumpia was very crispy but there wasn't much filling in it so all I could taste were the crispy outer layers. The sinigang had a hearty savory/sour taste to it with slow cooked pork and vegetables. It was good for the first few sips but I got a little tired of the taste after a while. The pancit was great. The rice noodles were well cooked and it came with shrimp and vegetables with a slice of hard boiled egg on top. I also enjoyed the dinuguan, an earthy rich pork stew that had a hint of spicy kick to it.  Drinks are by the bottle or can and are in a small fridge off to the side.   Overall it was a decent experience. I do prefer the ambiance of At My Place Cafe though, which is in the same shopping plaza and also offers Filipino food. I've only tried At My Place Cafe's breakfast though, so TBD which Filipino main dishes in this plaza reign supreme!"}
{"text":"I can't even rave more about this place! It's Amazing! The food is on point with the traditional Filipino recipes. The Crispy Pata is to die for and the sisig is top notch! Thank you to Angel and his staff you guys are truly great, and passionate about your love of cooking. I recommend this place to anyone who seeks authentic Filipino food! We will be back for more! - From your friends at Goodyear AZ. :)"}
{"text":"We are sitting out front on Tuesday, August 9, at noon and they are closed.  No message on the phone answering machine and their Yelp page says \"Open\".  Bad business."}
