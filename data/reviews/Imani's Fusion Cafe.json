{"text":"I was so disappointed in the service I received this past Sunday. After waiting for a cumulative of 2 hours only to be told my order was \"sold\" to someone else was very disheartening. The food looks and smells amazing but the lack of service will keep me from ever coming back."}
{"text":"Yes, the location is a little confusing but it's worth the visit.  This was a fantastic meal.  I had the pork chops and a pineapple upside down martini.  Very delicious!   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This food is great. Feels like some upscale homemade cookin and the servers are cool. I fux with Cha!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Food was terrible. Had two different orders and both came out burnt. They even messed up my egg white omelette. How do you burn egg whites?? Won't return"}
{"text":"This is 3.5 stars. Not to take away from the food, maybe to take a little from the atmosphere and location. It's the kind of place you really have to stumble upon. It's kind of like a hospital cafeteria, being that it's at the bottom of a medical building. I'm not sure how I came across or heard about this place or how they advertise with such an odd location. I stopped in for lunch with a co-worker on a Wednesday, not crowded at all. They offer sandwiches, soups, salads, breakfast (before 11 and they have a great breakfast selection), hot dogs, chicken tenders, and sides like fresh fruit (extra charge), mac and cheese, fried okra, french fries, and other things. The soup of the day was gumbo...not really. It was soup, that was just warm, with okra and sausage. It had good flavor but it was pale in color and had no rice. Not gumbo. I had the chicken tenders (like a kid) with a side of okra with a water for 7- almost $8. I hate to make these comparisons but, I can buy a whole bag of chicken tenders from Wal-Mart for $7! I only got three tenders and a small cup of okra. O_O For the type of place that Imani's is I would expect more or I would like to pay less for what I got. To me, that was a $4.75-$5 plate of food. I could go right down the street to chic-fil-a and get three tenders, a side and a drink for less. In defense of the chicken, it was fresh (not frozen) and hand-breaded. Just needed a little more seasoning. The very BEST thing we had was the AMAZING bread pudding. It is truly incredible. Everything bread pudding should be. Moist, great texture, great flavor, with a great sauce. A MUST have when dining at Imani's. They do brunch on Sundays with live music. Not sure that this would be a brunch destination for myself, but I would go back to try the breakfast when in the area...and definitely to get some of that bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Quick question, have you experienced a whirlwind of emotions from sampling fantastic cuisine? If not, your taste buds are about to be dining at the top of Mt Vesuvius whilst it is erupting. Imani's food is a flavor punch in the mouth with deliciousness. If you don't order jerk chicken waffle sliders your family should disown you your grandma will stop sending 12 dollars on your birthday. You are no longer a valid citizen in this democracy if you take one bite of these and don't immediately order more."}
{"text":"As first time visitors we did not have a pleasant experience. My husband and I just left the restaurant and we were highly disappointed. When we arrived there was no one in the restaurant yet customer service was horrendous!! When the server approached us he asked for our drink orders and then walked away and did not return. We saw him talking and laughing with another patron at the bar who arrived there after us. The Wendy Williams show was on and was very loud and the booth behind us was covered with papers and a laptop... It appeared to be someone's office. We waited for a while and finally left. As first time guest we would never recommends this place to anyone and left before even trying the food because the customer service was horrible!!! Thinking about trying it out????? Beware... Don't!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Worth the hunt to find this place. Excellent service and delicious food. 5 star presentation yet caters to business park lunch clientele.  Tried brunch and will be back as a regular."}
{"text":"I initially went here for chicken n waffles when they first opened and something happened with the waffle mix and ended up with wings only and bread pudding, a year or so later I return to try them again having the catfish strips, collard green cornbread, shrimp n grits ands a breakfast plate for my son.  The catfish was pretty good, but everything else was pretty average.  I really want to like this place so I will try once again to get that waffle...."}
{"text":"I loved eating at this cafe. The food was amazing and the prices were excellent. I tried the collard green muffins, crab cakes, jerk chicken waffle sliders, as well as jerk shrimp and grits. My eperience was great! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Friendly place hidden in a medical plaza celebrating 3 yrs.  Follow their signs and park at the far side of the building--easy, peasy.  My server. Khirston could not have been friendlier expertly answering questions and making suggestions.  \"K\" knows her stuff and is an asset to the owner, Imani (which means \"faith\" in Swaheli).  I ordered the Fusion Omelet and it was cooked perfectly to my liking:  gently scrambling the eggs and folded cozily in an omelet with all the good parts each peaking out saying \"pick me!\"  The swamp grits are TD4--creamy and el dente.    An added bonus is a free mud of Joe upon Yelp check in.  All this for $6.99!!  I'm in and I'm coming back with friends.  Good job, Imani and K!"}
{"text":"Brunch: I tried the salmon croquet, scrambled eggs, jerk shrimp & grits, chicken & waffle sliders, crab cakes, a collard green cornbread, and mimosas. Everything about the food exceeded expectations as far as portions, flavor, combinations, presentation, temperature, seasoning and even smell. The food was amazing. I'll be recommending this place alot. I'm really glad I came across it.  I wish I could afford to donate some better artwork for them though. It wasn't week decorated but that didn't get in the way of the food :)"}
{"text":"I'm struggling with this review.  Let me break it down:  Service: 2 star Food:  Mixed bag,  I think I was the one most pleased and I rated it a 3.5, the rest of my party probably rated it a 2.   Please note this restaurant is in the basement of a medical building.  It does feature windows and OK décor, but still, in a office plaza.  They do a decent job of updating signage though.  I was never confused on where to go.  The  service:  The servers were very pleasant, but everything was so slow.  We missed our movie thanks to Imani.  I guess scheduling an hour for what is basically a cafeteria isn't adequate.  They were fully booked, and had three waitresses.  I understand that the kitchen is small,  the waitress told us as such, but that's not an excuse for being slow on drinks, order taking, or getting the bill.  They servers were quite nice,  I'm not trying to slam them, but I call a spade a spade.  The Food:  I had the red velvet waffle.  Far superior to Terrace Café.  Yes, I said it.  The marshmallow fluff was awesome and the waffle was quite good.  The chicken wings that came with it.  Nothing special.  The greens, probably the best thing on the menu.  I enjoyed the cornbread muffins too, but I think I was the one who was most impressed with them.  One of my dinning companions had the fried green tomatoes.  She indicated they were good,  the other companion had the curry chicken.  It smelled good to me, but she said it was nothing spectacular and it was luke warm.  Also weird is the fact that it was billed as a 'special'  but was clearly available every day on the menu.  So to recap - I don't wanna trash the place.  My food was OK, but the negatives of the slow service just made me not want to come back.  Sorry Chef Imani.  Though I was encouraged to see the tables all booked, so hopefully this place will thrive and maybe work out the kinks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a healthcare building. We waited 45 minutes to receive our food. Average food, nothing to call home about"}
{"text":"Let me say the brunch was really good. We had the French toast with butterscotch syrup and the red velvet waffles. Both were delectable and the fried chicken wings were some of the best I have ever had. Could not give the establishment 5 stars for a couple of reasons one being the Mimosa and Chardonnay were not served at the proper temperature.  Our waiter was very friendly however it was a very busy day, several large parties, so service was not optimum. Minor challenges that day do not deter another visit as the food is better than several top notch local restaurants."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the food.  I am not crazy about the location.   They definitely could use another staff person to seat the patrons."}
{"text":"I told my friend I was craving chicken & waffles and she took me here. I can say the place needs a little update on the interior design but the food was absolutely amazing. The chicken was well seasoned and the waffles were fluffy and buttery. We had a guy server and he spoke to us like we were family which was a nice warm feeling . I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes ."}
{"text":"I thought his place was great. Food was on point and the staff was patient and friendly. I just wish it was more out in the open for more people to see."}
{"text":"Great hidden Gem off of Randolph rd (has a randolph address, but you have to turn on to Billingsley Dr, then make your first right.  Tucked below an office building.  We had their Sunday Brunch and everything was amazing!  It's Soul Food with a little bit of Caribbean spices and fusion!  We had the crab cakes, Collard Green Muffins (amazing).  Make sure you try the Candid Yam butter on them.  We split the Salmon Croquettes entree.  It was really good, especially the flavorful crust.   To finish it off, i had some of the best Bread pudding i've ever tasted...and i've tried a lot!    Small intimate atmosphere with friendly service.  Single chef owner who highlights his own recipes!"}
{"text":"Ok. This is hard for me because I'm a HUGE advocate for supporting black owned and local/small business.   Basing this off of food (2 stars), service (2 stars), and location (1), Imani Infusion takes all when it comes to the food. The taste and presentation were great. The jerk shrimp and grits is to die for; I dissect everything I eat and once again, I cannot figure out what they use specifically in the sauce for this dish. The best version of this dish I've had to date. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken strips and waffles. 2 full stars for the food.  The service gets 1 star. A half really but I don't have that option. The hostess was nonexistent. My party along with 4 other parties stood outside the restaurant looking at 2 available tables. This place clearly was not ready for the influx of business. And the waitress made that clear when she stated they sold out of chicken wings, and have no ice. \"We've never had this much business.\" You probably need to better train your staff. Also the service is very slow, not that it was my main concern. I had time. My worry here is when the waitress  randomly came over and stated \"his food is ready but yours isn't.\" She was just 18, I get it. She was nice. And I am happy to see us helping employ our own but please better train the staff.  The location is confusing. It's in a Medical park so there's no way to get business from people who are just driving by. And when we got there we couldn't get in so we had to circle around to the back and ask another party we saw leaving.  Overall, the flavors were so amazing I can't help but consider giving them another try, but I def urge them to work on the service/management of this place."}
{"text":"We decided to try Imani's Fusion Café out for brunch after hearing a lot of great reviews around town.   Once we arrived there was only 5 people in the restaurant, so we received the full hands treatment displayed to us.  Our server was Alexis, who was very friendly and showed tons of personality.  She stated that we could sit anywhere and we took a booth seat.  After reviewing the brunch menu, we decided on the fried green tomatoes, crab cakes, chicken & waffles, jerk shrimp with grits. Once the appetizers came out Alexis stated to us that she made a mistake with our crab cakes by giving us the larger portions.  She stated that we would love the mistake jokingly and said she would check back with us in a few.  After trying the larger portion crab cakes, we both notice that they were a little under cooked and cold in spots.  Which was a disappointment but we went on to the fried green tomatoes. The fried green tomatoes were ok, just was excepting more.   So on to our main courses and I must say I enjoyed my chicken and waffles but my lady thought the Jerk Shrimp & Grits was okay.  She had to do a lot of work peeling the shrimp but I knew she wasn't going to complain because she was hungry.  I shared some of my food with her and she also thought the Chicken from the Chicken and Waffles was good.  The chicken was seasoned perfectly and saved the experience in my book. Once Alexis brought the check out I noticed that the crab cakes that we were going to \"love the mistake\" for the larger portions we were charge $8.00 instead of $6.00.  Not cool in my book especially when it was an error on the server and not us.  So, our total came to $41.00 but don't think it was deserving of it.  Maybe their lunch and general breakfast items are better than brunch but who's to say.  Therefore, I gave it 3 of 5 stars, pluses where Alexis upbeat personality and the chicken."}
{"text":"Came down for CIAA 2013 weekend and discovered this hidden treasure. I loved the live jazz played during brunch and service was superb. From the coconut cake balls to the crab cake with mango sauce. Definitely can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"Came here for a Groupon for Sunday brunch and it was fantastic! Good soul food style. There were 5 of us and everyone greatly enjoyed their meals. Service was great. Imani's is a hidden gem and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was there again with the Ladies for Brunch Take Over. Oh my the first time visiting was good but the second was better. The Collard green muffins with the sweet potato whipped butter had me the first time. The second time well let's just say I was hooked the first time. Shrimp and grits. Who knew? Who knew? I know so I'm spreading the word. Make your way to enjoy the food with his unique fusion. I shall be back. Did I mention the collard greens? So good they make you hurt yourself."}
{"text":"Can we say YUM!   Before I elaborate on the deliciooooous entrees, let me say , this place is totally not visible from the road and if it had a sign , people would definitely stop in more .  We arrived at 11am Sunday and there were no other customers . I'm ok with that , you mean my food will be faster *high five. *The decor is very outdated,simple , and nothing to photo , but if it's clean I could care less. \"Your know why I'm here \" in my Marshawn Lynch voice.  The customer service was great , the young lady had a pleasant demeanor.  We started off with the cornbread and collard green muffins , omg these are so scrumptious , the collard greens alone were seasoned to perfection,  I have to get them as a side next time . I ordered the curry chicken with yellow rice , my daughter and love ordered the jamaican shrimp and grits . We ordered the Jr. Waffle with eggs for the little one.   First, best shrimp and grits I've had in Charlotte. Bursting with flavor, this is how you cook southern shrimp and grits and bc it has that Jamaican jerk flare this made the flavor even more robust. My teen and my toddler ate every last bit of their meals .    Last but not least , because I'll be back.  My curry chicken smelled great, tasted great, was a great portion size , and it had the right amount of all white meat chicken breast cubed with curry seasoning, and accompaniments of sautéed onions and green peppers. There were 2 nicely fried plantains to garnish the meal as well.   I'm not sure how the traffic is here during the weekdays but this is definitely a go to brunch spot for me and my family . You gotta love good \"homemade\" food that's unique and actually taste good."}
{"text":"Expensive, slow service. Repeated mediocre experience. I live across the street. Sure wish it was better."}
{"text":"My staff and I have been ordering from this place since it started from park cafe and Nikki's now to Imani's fusion cafe and the menu has carried over with all the name changes, nothing new just different seasoning. The food is excellent Imani is a very tallented Chef and a very polite individual he and the other cooks are customer friendly. However the lady operating the register is very RUDE and has a nasty attitude not cutomer friendly over the phone and neither in person. It is very disheartening to have this happening to several people who come there and order from the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had the buffalo chicken wrap without bacon and it was pretty good. The Mac and cheese is ugly but taste good. A little confusion upon walking in. You aren't sure if you seat yourself, walk up to order, wait for a hostess, etc. Cozy environment. Excellent service. Not a hard location to find but can be tricky because you can't see a sign from the road."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It is a strange location, behind a some medical offices.  You would have no idea that its there if you weren't specifically looking for it.    The décor is certainly not going to grab you.  But that's not why I go to Imani's.  The food is fantastic!  I have been very happy with everything that I have ordered.  They do have some standard brunch fair, but I can't imagine why anyone would order that when they have such great Caribbean dishes.  On my last visit we ordered the chicken curry that a wonderful bright fruity flavor that blended very nicely with the richness of the curry.  We also had the jerked shrimp which was also great.     This place has it's own unique vibe with a definite ethnic feel to it.  That's part of what makes it interesting.  The service is fast and friendly, and the prices are reasonable.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered from a Foodie Call and was looking very forward to the bread pudding and the pork chops. I was disappointed. For one, looking at other pics of the pork chops it seems I was cheated of the sauce that belongs on top and perhaps that would've calmed some of the overdose of other flavors I got. When I got my order the mashed sweet potatoes and chutney were turned upside down so needless to say half of it was spilled into the bag (but that could've been done on the delivery end so I deduct no stars for that). I don't know if it was just an off day or what because everything was over seasoned and that's saying a lot for me. I have to chew my food to oblivion and by the time I'm done chewing and ready to swallow, the flavor is gone completely. However, the pork chops were salty even after all that chewing. Like need a glass of water to prevent dehydration salty. My mashed potatoes were super sweet and the same with my bread pudding (with or without the rum sauce). If you're diabetic it may not be the move for you. If you are a chef, tasting your product is key to making sure it's consistent and perfectly seasoned. I might give them another shot with a different dish. I really can't say but I couldn't finish this meal. It ended up in the garbage. $15 wasted. Geesh!"}
{"text":"They have the best cornbread collard green muffins, chicken &I red velvet cake waffle! I and the butterscotch French toast is amazing and huge!!!!! Everything tastes so good. It's a hidden jewel!!"}
