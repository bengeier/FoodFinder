{"text":"Food is good.  Wings are huge and beer is cold.  Place has bands on Fri and Saturday nights.  Great little place in Broadview Heights to listen to some good old bands and enjoy friends.."}
{"text":"I was right. Court foreclosed this winter. Perhaps it will be replaced with a Planet Fitness"}
{"text":"Good food.  Good beer selection There on a Saturday to watch the OSU Michigan State Game. Crowd dwindled after game.  People smoking inside. Owner ( female) came by, I commented about the  smoke.  She ignored me, did nothing, I continued to smell smoke 10 minutes later.  Enough for me.  Any reasom I have to come home smelling like an ashtray? No thanks. Not going to make it with that approach."}
{"text":"Waited nearly two hours for food. Can't comment on the food because we left before we were served. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I worked tonight and never saw you, Barry. The food and service is a million times better then what Wing Warehouse ever was. They are family owned,  and care about quality. We also have bands on the weekends and run daily dinner specials."}
