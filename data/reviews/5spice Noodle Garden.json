{"text":"This place is amazballs!  Food is so authentic and fresh,  you've got spice crunch (my husband loves extra spicy I'm med and kids aren't spice fans but they have all levels) didn't know these combination of flavors existed!  My kids love the beef wraps!  We adore the servers here service is excellent and ambiance is exceptionally clean!  I give this place 5stars and two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch here, trusting the many stars bestowed on this establishment by the good citizens of Yelp-dom. I got in at the peak of lunchtime and there were several empty tables. No biggie, on to the review. 

Service: 5/5 Just the way I like it. Polite, attentive but unobtrusive

Decor & ambiance: Clean and airy. The tables are not as tightly packed together as is common in small eateries. Nice art, good lighting, no complaints from this dinner

Bonus: they have a liquor license!"}
{"text":"If your in Calgary this restaurant is a must visit if you love authentic Chinese food. Every bite was a rush of flavours. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Really, really good. I'm actually a little worried about them because it's always empty, but it is fairly new. They deserve to be \"discovered\" by Calgary's foodies.

First off, this is actual Chinese food, not Chinese food for white people... however, I noticed they have recently added a small menu of westernized dishes like ginger beef and mu shu pork to entice a wider clientele, which is fine as these dishes are just as tasty as the main menu. Particularly the mu shu pork--probably the best I've ever had. The steamed buns are great too, with lots of ginger.

As the name would suggest they have lots of different noodle options but plenty of other stuff as well. The food is served family-style, so everyone is meant to eat from each dish rather than everyone ordering their own (with the possible exception of the soups). Everything is fresh, with lots of flavour and seems skillfully prepared. The service is very friendly and fast, and it's as clean and inviting as a place in an Ogden strip mall can be. Definitely worth a visit to taste for yourself."}
{"text":"The service was great. Super friendly and nice. They accommodate any requests to the menu and like others posted will make dishes that aren't on the menu. We came for dinner to have Vietnamese noodles, and noticed right away something was different. 

The restaurant is clean and fits about 30-40 people I've never seen it full or that busy. 

We will be back. I had the Singapore rice noodles and they were really good, lots of little pieces of meat and veggies. 

My son had Vietnamese style noodle bowl with pork, spring rolls and yummy sauce. It was great! Better than the Vietnamese restaurant that used to be there. 

And my sons friend had the special which was soup and beef rolls. Really good and authentic. A little bit of a kick in the rolls. 

We started with the steamed pork dumplings. They were piping hot and very flavorful, not greasy or anything. 

Anyway, definitely 5 stars, no complaints at all. Service was great, food was delicious  and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Sadly, I stopped by the other day and the restaurant was closed and a new pho restaurant appears to be opening. Too bad, we enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect coming here but we wanted a casual place to eat at a decent price and Yelp steered us here to the SE.
It is a Chinese restaurant and my fave part of it was the service. Our server was a lovely lady who had a great sense of humor.
The Jasmine tea here is free, love that.
The place was clean.
Only 2 and a half months old.
We ordered spring rolls (5 in an order). Well rolled, crispy and thin. A great choice.
I ordered one of my fave dishes, Singapore Noodles, extra spicy. They gear everything to medium heat here so make sure and ask for your preference.
My meal was good. Well seasoned with a nice balance of noodles, veg and egg. I had to add extra chili oil for more heat but overall, enjoyed my meal and took half home with me.
Hubby had fried rice with beef and pineapple. He gave this a 3 star mainly due to lack of seasoning. I argued with him that that was so he could put soy sauce on it and season it himself. I liked his but in the end, he stated that he would stick to chicken with his rice as his preferred protein. Our meals did come out at different times, I guess encouraging one to share.
The restaurant at 6pm on a Sat was surprisingly dead but it was very nice out so maybe that was a factor...
I would return here for the service alone.
Great place for take out orders and the chef will cook things to order even if there is something you want that you do not see on the menu IE Pho soups, ginger beef, etc.
For the lunch go-ers, no buffet here (I prefer a la carte personally) but there are daily specials for weekdays up on their board.
Go and relax in the quiet atmosphere (soft music, no hustle and bustle) and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great soup!  Nice and clean! Not western Chinese food ! Reasonable price! It a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese noodle in town. Amazing soup noodle and quality Ingredients. Super clean and nice people. It would be nice if I could ask for extra meat for meat lovers like me. Very authentic even compare to Toronto."}
{"text":"Really tasty!!!! Super clean restaurant very friendly staff! I ordered the duck noodle soup to go, and a Vietnamese coffee- it was great the soup was HUGE! She gave me an extra bowl so I could make a lunch sized portion at work. The noodles come in a separate container so they don't get soggy. The duck has bones just as an FYI. The only thing I didn't like was the CILANTRO but I had no idea it was in there going in so next time I will ask for it without. Otherwise very tasty not like PHO but it was great. I'll be back for sure and the lunch specials seem really awesome too! I just wish they were more active at updating them on social media."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is definitely worth trying!  The service was exceptional and the food was A+++++ The spiciness was perfect and they had FRESH Asian pickled mustard green.  It was ahhhmazing with the noodles :) They have plenty of options from gluten free, vegetarian and non spicy dishes! I will be coming here more often when im in town!"}
