{"text":"Awesome Chinese, ordered today for the first time and we all loved it! It's our new go-to - food arrived hot, fresh and delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is great. Really is some of the best Chinese food in the City. We are lucky it's in our neighbourhood! They also have a Thai menu that's excellent as well."}
{"text":"Although we didn't actually eat here, we opted to have our food delivered from here. We ordered online and were quoted 60 minutes for delivery time. It arrived within 45 minutes, so yay! We ordered our usual Chinese food favorites: hot and sour soup, fried rice, cashew chicken, ginger beef and squid. We were very impressed! Everything was so flavorful and delicious. Portion sizes were on the larger side too...there were only 3 of us and we'll have leftovers for days. This is probably going to become our new go-to for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it was delivered piping hot in about 30 minutes!  The food was delicious!  We have found our new go-to Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Chinese in all of Calgary.  If you like ginger beef you have to get it from here!"}
{"text":"Really the best Chinese take out in the area in my opinion. \"The area\" for us is as far north as Beddington Trail and as far south as 20th Ave NW and as Far East as Deerfoot and as far West as 19th St. I can honestly say we have eaten Chinese food from all the local take out joints and they have been pretty shockingly poor in general. Some hits and misses in the same orders but this place is awesome. I was really impressed with the quality of the food, the fresh vegetables and the sheer volume of food for a very reasonable cost. On another note cheap and lots for us is not a sign of quality as we've often paid more for better quality and been happy with it but this is delicious and lots for very reasonable cost. It will be our go to place for Chinese take out in the future. I don't know that I'd eat in restaurant as the \"dining room\" is a little dingy and not very comfortable in appearance. The service from the people in this restaurant is friendly and convivial. The value is awesome. Check it out.....! I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes my pants tight... And not just because it fills me up. This is the best GD Chinese food I've ever had! This makes my former favorite - whateveritis on 4th - taste like it was cooked in the sewer. The \"homemade dumplings\" will make you wish you grew up in a different home (and country!). 
Fresh, so tasty and the delivery guy was super friendly. BAM!"}
{"text":"The portions are really good and the food is always fresh, the soups are excellent especially the hot n spicy I am making myself hungry writing this review. The online order is really convenient and perfect for a lazy Sunday this has become my place to go for a quick munch without having to leave the house. Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"Got delivery, came quick, well packed. Surprised by the amount of food, I have enough for a couple days. Ginger beef was amazing. Good spring rolls too. Will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh and tasty food! 
Delivery guy was super friendly..
not cheap but worth the extra dollars to have good size portions of real chicken , fresh chop sueuy, spring rolls, crispy ginger beef and perfectly seasoned curry muchroom fried rice.
Will order again!"}
{"text":"Oh Peking House 98, how I love thee...and your Hot & Sour soup!!! Last Saturday had marked one month of this lousy cold so it was time for measures of last resort. (Hot & Sour soup is my secret weapon when I'm sick, so it needs to be really good.)

I've ordered from here many times in the past and can't believe I haven't reviewed them before. There wasn't even a listing, despite the fact that they've been in Hidden Valley for many years now. 

The dinner for two was more than enough to feed three adults and one five year old. They even allowed us to substitute one of the predefined combo items for Salt & Pepper Squid. The other items were Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour Pineapple Pork, spring rolls and, of course, Hot & Sour soup. All I have to say is that my sinuses were very happy and all tummies were full. The squid was absolutely perfect - crispy, without being overly salted or spicy.

They only do take-out or delivery, but let this restaurant live in your bookmarks for the next time you need great Chinese food."}
{"text":"They have about 6 tables to eat in. Excellent food everything was fresh awesome server portions we perfect! 

We had the palace style chicken perfectly done I have never had better! Curry chicken lots of chicken and perfectly cooked vegetables., fried rice 

Long drive but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese takeout. You can eat in but it's just a few tables. They always deliver on time or before the time they give on the phone. 
I love the dumplings and salt and pepper chicken.  I've never had the Thai but it definitely satisfies when you're craving Chinese takeout.
I find them very honest, always quoting the delivery charge on the phone. There are no surprises here, just good, consistent food and delivery service."}
{"text":"Really? Thai food? I don't think so.. not even close to Thai food taste. Had a delivery of Hot & Sour Coconut Soup (allegedly a want-to-be Thai's infamous Tom Yum) - has flat taste of coconut and chili pepper.  Entree was a Traditional Thick Noodles with Chicken & Prawns (a wannabe Pad Thai). You get better street food than what I got from Peking House 98.

And shock - My order of $35 CA dollars was charged $6.00 delivery because it's downtown order, what? The website deceived me - $35 dollars + orders were free delivery. 

I can't even express how dissatisfied I was - the food went into garbage. Dinner spoiled. Total scum."}
{"text":"Best take out Chinese I've had in years. Arrived hot. Delivery guy was polite and friendly. The whole family loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. We usually get a take out meal for two which comes with fried rice, wonton soup, two entrees and fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Very polite staff. Very large portions. We ordered dinner for 2 and it was enough to feed 4-5. We ate as much as we could and the rest went to waste. I recommend smaller portions a bit cheaper menu. 
The ginger beef and sesame chicken were extremely greasy and extremely sweet. I won't be ordering these two items any more. Delicious but very unhealthy."}
{"text":"Love love love this family and their restaurant!!! Great food all the time and so fresh and hot!! If you want great Chinese / Thai food, you must go here!"}
{"text":"We've ordered take out from here twice now, and have found  our new favourite place for Peking. Best ginger beef I've had in years! Generous portions, piping hot, friendly staff, and their online ordering system is very easy to use."}
