{"text":"Great food! QUICK service and always a good option for late night eats.  Prices are fair but have a good selection of a different korean dishes."}
{"text":"24 hours. This North York location has an extensive menu. Most everything is reliably tasty.  BUT YOU MUST GO BBQ OUTSIDE.  Out back. It opens after 5pm.  You. Must. Oh, btw, there's free parking out back as well..  That is all."}
{"text":"This is the only location I go to.  I've been to the other location and the service , food and broth are not the same.    We shared    Pork bone soup.   Meat is very similar in quality as all the other korean placea in gta but the broth is a little more tasty  LA beef ribs.    Good  but just average  Deep fried pork.  Worst dishof the night.   Very Dry and tough.  I had much better in the area.    Free side dishes are very basic and they only give them to yiu when they serves your food.   It the only korean place that pratice that.  I guess they don't want to to get too full on the free sides and then take you main meals home or too order less.    They open up a butcher next door but it is always empty.   I would go rather go  to galleria  nearby at steeles but more variety and I assume better prices"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Subpar food, small portions, stale decor. The only redeeming factor is its average menu price."}
{"text":"Service very cold, food ok, price more expensive than average, no tax given on receipt."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is not the best but I still like it. One thing I don't like about the pork bone soup is that's no protein. It's like eating a soup with a bone in it. There's hardly meat at all. Well on bright side meat is unhealthy especially pork so I tend to think oh well I ate less of  bad thing. .  I came here with my sis 2 am in the morning it was fun experience lol... there were other people as well so it wasn't awkward. the pork bone soup tasted better than when we ate at lunch or dinner for some reason.  ( we weren't drunk for one thing) I think if there are less orders in the restaurant the food tends to be better.   I recommend this place XD"}
{"text":"I'm giving this poor rating based on the take out order I received today. I placed an order for pork bone soup for takeout (not the first time I've ordered this either in store or take home).   I expected a fresh meal, straight from the kitchen but what I got was a not so fresh meal, straight from the freezer.   They gave me an order of pre made instant pork bone soup - something you can purchase from the grocery store. On the lid, it clearly says \"keep frozen until ready to eat\" then gives the instruction of microwaving it for 5 minutes for a quick and easy meal. A photo of it has been uploaded.  I cannot believe I was charged full price for something they sell at the supermarket in the frozen aisle. This exact product has been spotted in the supermarket on sale for $3!!!!  Very disappointed. Now wondering if they even cook their own food for their in restaurant patrons or if they just microwave these instant meals."}
{"text":"Food poisoning from the bibimbap! I came here to eat with my friends on a late Thursday night as this is one of the many places that are open 24/7. The day after eating here, I had gotten a big stomach ache and spent most of my day in the washroom. Luckily I was the only one who got the bibimbap since the rest of my friends got either the gam ja tang or the bulgogi so nothing was wrong with them (don't know why I didn't just stick with the pork bone soup). I got the stomach ache Friday morning and its Sunday today yet I'm still feeling the stomach pains. The bibimbap wasn't even that great either - really bad experieence for me. I am definitely not getting any more bibimbap, EVER!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to when hungry at night with a group of friends. The food is pretty good, but nothing too special out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to give these guys FOUR stars.  Pork Bone Soup = Garlicky, spicy, boiling goodness.  Probably not the healthiest thing you can eat at insane 3am hours.. but it seems like what my Korean friends like to do.  Sing karaoke, drink soju and eat pork bone soup =)  Their crispy deep fried sweet & sour pork with apples was yummy as well.. no idea how they got it so darn crispy.    I have to say the banchans are pretty decent too... it seems like the more you drink, the better stuff you get on the house.  And I thought the menus were rather interesting.. combos??!!  You order a dish, and either five bottles of beer or a bottle of soju for a set price.  What a brilliant idea for the alkies!  The little button on the table to call the waitress/waiter was funny but a good idea.  But the loud Korean Justin Timberlake on TV... not so much."}
{"text":"I wish one of the other Korean spots on Bloor was open 24 hours. Or until 2 am. I keeping thinking it's a good idea to go here late at night, and being disappointed with the stews and soups. I had kimchi pork stew last night, and I couldn't finish it. The broth and pork bits were tasty enough, but kimchi wasn't great and the rice it came with had a couple of specks in it that made it look old. The banchan were also not the freshest, particularly the bean sprouts, which are usually my favourite. I'm not saying I'm not going to go back, but if I do, I'm only ordering dumplings, rice cake or japchae.   The service was friendly though, and I really enjoyed the rotation of K-Pop music videos. The fact that they have an ATM kind of makes up for it being cash only."}
{"text":"READ THIS BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO ORDER.  So as i am writing this review, I am lying in bed recovering from food poisoning. I am usually a big fan of OWL and fancy going to their Mississauga and Bloor street location but this time around I was in the uptown area and decided to order some tofu soup and spicy rice cakes.  Well that was a mistake. I knew that when I first received my meal from the over exhausted/rude waitress this was not going to be good. I ate it anyways seeing as I had already built my trust up with this restaurant chain. My experience this past monday night was not too pleasant as well. We got seated by their waitress station and every 2 minutes a waitress would swing her cart full of hot soup in my direction. Literally at face level, bowls of hot soup being swung as she prepared side dishes for another table. And yes, you heard right monday night... it is now friday, a whole week off of work and doctor visits.  I typically only use these review sites to post wonderful comments about restaurants I find and not even food poisoning would urge me to make a post but if it wasn't for their lack of precautionary measures I wouldn't be here writing this today.  I understand that they use the carts to be more efficient but you should train your staff to know that customers do not appreciate scolding hot soup being swung in their direction. The cherry on top is the fowl (insert pun here) smell of everything being fermented/pickled.  As for the food poisoning I got from eating the seafood tofu soup... I would avoid it so your stomach doesn't hate you for the rest of your life. I am also not surprised that other yelpers have posted reviews stating that THEY TOO had food poisoning. Some scary practices are going on that should be brought to the managers attention. Don't get me wrong food tastes good and prices here are amazing but the effects of cross contamination is not fun."}
{"text":"Great location for lunch or snacks or midnight fix (open 24h, which really adds to the appeal). Food is flavourful, consistent, and good portion size. I love the bulgolgi."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner with my boyfriend and I tried a new menu item, it was a kimchi fried rice dish with vegetables. It was quite delicious and the portion size wasn't enormous, which I liked.   The ambiance is nice and casual too, a bit on the noisy side but that's because they are extremely busy. When we arrived we were lucky to get a seat because every table was full. I would advise to bring cash just in case, they normally take credit but on this particular day their machine was down. I didn't have a problem, since I took out cash beforehand.   I'd definitely come back, the place is nice and cozy and the staff are polite. I'd like to try their spicy rice cake dish next time."}
{"text":"The worst service you will ever get! We were in a group of 5 and went there around 1A.M, the waiter did not care about us at all. We had to walk to the counter and ask for paper and pen to write our order down ourselves and sent the paper back to the waiter. Our water cups were never refilled and the food were slow. Then we were charged for 15% tip in our bill, and the owner said they have to charge 15% tip at late night when the customers in 5+ group. We told the owner about the poor service we got,and she said,:\" I will waive the tip for you this time, but it's 2 in the morning. What do you expect?!\" Why would any customer has to put up with this attitude? Does that mean all customers have to serve themselves at all late night restaurants? This is not the first time that we received this shitty attitude from this restaurant. On our last visit, the waiter was watching soccer match on TV and did not respond to any table that was in need of service. We paid the bill with 15% of tip last time and this time too, but this time is our last visit to this restaurant. We will not come to this restaurant ever again and we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup they serve here is among the best meals I've ever had. It's a humongous meal with a flavour I haven't tasted in any other meal. The lines out the door are for good reason. My friends and I come by frequently, whenever we're extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Awesome it truly has  amazing foods I Really love it the porkbone soup to die for and allso rice dishes highly recommended. Great place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It's never closed and the staff are friendly. The food is delicious and served in large portions. Order anything from the menu and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fresh and nice food ! Fair prices and good customer service . I would DEFF recommend this places to anyone ."}
{"text":"This has been a favourite for over 4 years. I love the bulgogi!! If you like spicy food you can always request that they make it spicey. Staff is cheerful and adds to the experience. Another bonus? It's 24 hours!!!!"}
{"text":"I like how they're open late. I've tried many things there but I would only recommend getting their pork bone soup (besides, that's what they're famous for!). Their bulgogi is alright, but I prefer the bulgogi from a restaurant across from them. Owl is definitely a go to spot for my friends and I when we need a nice-hearty meal!"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup for the price is one of the best.  I can't say I order anything else here."}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats the stir fried glass noodles and kimchi pancake. I was so excited to eat these but they were both incredibly salty and awful tasting. I am not a picky person at all and have eaten lots of Korean food. These were greasy and salty and I could barely eat them. I was so incredibly disappointed. Will never return."}
{"text":"It was really loud, but the gamjatang was good, except for the soup. A lot of tender meat, enough veggies and a potato (\"gamja\")  was there. The broth, I could taste the MSG, so I didn't drink.  But I got food poisoning. So did a family member of mine at this location, years ago. Both times, it was the gamjatang. Those who ordered anything else were fine. Weird.  I know tons of people have had the gamjatang, and obviously, many others didn't have this problem. However, the family member and myself are very healthy individuals who have never had any reactions to MSG, and this is our only food poisoning in years. So I guess the food isn't very hygienic? I don't know. But I know I got sick from the gamjatang.  If I ever get sick from your food, I am going to give you lowest rating possible, hence the one star."}
{"text":"I love the variety here. They usually have all the things I'm craving but the only thing I wish they had was jajangmyeon. But the food is good and satisfies my cravings with good moderate prices. Plus the service is nice and helpful, plus a short wait time even on the weekends."}
{"text":"A small spot in A Chinese hub and was quite busy at any given time. We decided to have an early dinner/late lunch and thought would avoid big crowds but we were mistaken. The place was packed even at the odd time in the afternoon. We had the Bulgogi, LA Kalbi, KamJaTang. The food was good although the general feeling while we were there was hurried and fast. Wasn't a long wait for the food and it was reasonably priced. Would probably go back again just to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is good for one thing and one thing only. If your head hurts and you need a cure... go down to this restaurant and order kamjatang and i guarantee that pain will go away!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Open 24/7 is amazing, especially with their 5 beers and a main for $20 combo.  My girlfriend is gluten free, and so is the Bibim Bap. Score.  Sides are yummy, kim chi is spicy, and service is fast.  Interior is pretty hole-in-the-wallish but good food at good prices and lots of booze makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've gone there a bunch of time and the food is good but the customer service is horrible!! They are so rude and even tried to charge us for the side dishes when they're free... very unprofessional, I recommend Nuri Village instead, better food and better customer service."}
{"text":"Visited here with my mother two ago for an early lunch before heading to Btrust for some groceries.    This was my first time trying out this place as I am a big fan of Korean Food. Let's say this Owl of Minerva didn't really meet my benchmark of what great Korean food is.   Starting with the service.  It was extremely slow, the girl who was serving us was extremely rude.  She just carried an angry face with during the whole time I was there with my mother.  She was very hesitant and didn't even want to get what we wanted - which was hot sauce. It took almost 25 minutes to get all the food out and waiting an extra  5 minutes for the bill since the waitress was busy eating her breakfast at the table.  Not to mention, there was ONLY 1 waitress.    While the food itself, it lacked in portion size.  The flavour and the extreme grease was there but for what you're paying for a plate approx $10 and above, it's really not worth it.  Also, the menu itself - there isn't a great  vast of selection of Korean dishes compared to other Korean Restaurants.   I expected much more from this place but it is overpriced and the service isn't that great.  Hopefully I will give it a try once again another day and will update again."}
{"text":"24hrs, quick service, good food. But, over priced... Must try the Pork bone soup (Kam ja tang)"}
{"text":"??????????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????? ??????????????????"}
{"text":"Whenever I come back to Toronto, I always have this on my list of \"good, cheap, open late, comfort food\" spots. I like this place because it does all 4 consistently. No more, no less. They're not into the fancy fine dining nor are they a literal hole in the wall giving you hole in the wall food you could cook better yourself.  The pork bone soup (gamjatang) here is phenomenal. If you want to eat with your hands, dive in. The pork bone meat just falls off the bone and sucking out the marrow while your friends watch in disgust (especially non-Asians) is still one of the best shock value moments you'll get that day. It also comes with the staple Korean pickled and spiced sides.   I've yet to venture out to try other things on the menu because I know what I like from this place. But I will eventually.   I also almost always get lost coming in through the rear entrance of the restaurant from the parking lot. I've wandered through the kitchen a couple times so watch out for that if you're parked out back.   Other than that, go eat some quality gamjatang here for lunch, dinner, or hell, even 2 am snack!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Far from some of the white washed restaurants you'll find. Weird tv shows usually playing, but that adds to the charm if it. Word of warning: if you order spicy be ready for really spicy, they're not messing around. If you have time to kill or aren't too concerned about when you catch your train this would be a must eat before you leave Oakville. There's also a Owl of Minevera in Toronto, but it's hard to go back knowing the dozens of the other resteraunts, plus it's out of the way."}
{"text":"This is my \"Go To\" when I'm craving Korean food. I miss it when I'm away from Toronto. It's always reliably delicious and consistent in it's quality, flavor, and service. It's cheap and cheerful. The service is quick. I eat the Kimchee Chigae (pork), or the Bulgogee (spicy) which arrives sizzling on a hot plate. My husband orders Pork Bone Soup (Gam Ja Tang) or tried something new and it's always tasty. Parking in the rear, and BBQ tables during the summer on the back patio. MY ONLY WISH is that there were more appetizers on the menu - less expensive and smaller portions - so I can try more items without ordering the full meal version of them."}
{"text":"I like coming here for a quick sit-down place. The place is very convenient when I want something quick.   I normally won't purposely come here if I wanted good korean food. There are many other korean restaurants in the area that I would prefer to choose over this place.  Overall, it is a solid place if you want korean food quickly"}
{"text":"Owl is always good for a late night snack.  With this place you are never disappointed as you know exactly what you'll get - not the best but pretty good."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup in this place seems to be the specialty.  but after eating at other places, this place is just OK.  The price is around $7-8 as well and the apetizer served were good but not that memorable.   I went with my cousin and her hubby.  As I looked around the restaurant and saw that everyone had ordered the pork bone soup I figured this is the thing to order.  I also saw a friend of mine with a girl that is not his gf!   The dish itself tasted good. It came in a piping hot broth topped with bean sprouts, potato, and chives.  It also comes with a dish of rice.  The ambiance is good.  Clearly good enough for my friend who appeared to be on a date with a girl who is not his gf!  But this is also the guy who got photographed at a nightclub and published online with another girl who is not his gf.  So lesson learned, do not go to this place for a covert date and definitely order the pork bone soup."}
{"text":"The decor ok, the tv was too pound and they sat us there even though they knew we did not understand Korean. The service was just ok, the men's washroom was one the worse I had a snow shovel and mop bucket with dirty mop beside me. My wife and I have been 2 other Owl of  Minerva locations and they were way better than this one, the food was ok. Will not be going to this ever."}
{"text":"Reading up on all the hype surrounding the pork-bone soup, this was obviously what I was most excited about when coming here. I will say that the pork-bone soup was very good. The pork falls right off the bone and the soup is the right level of spicy. I saw almost every other table had ordered pork-bone soup too. It was a hit, to say the least. The soup was the only excellent part of the dinner.  I was with a group of six and we ordered everything to share. The other dishes were good and I was full very quickly. I'm going to attribute that to how oily and fatty most of the dishes were. It was that kind of full. I was expecting that, but I still don't enjoy the feeling.  I didn't have high expectations about the service considering this place is so cheap. However, there were two things that didn't reflect well on the service that I'm not going to let slide:   1) We ordered beers and the server kept bringing them over without opening them. And they weren't twist off. Were we supposed to use the table to open them? One of us had a bottle opener on a keychain so we managed. This is a simple thing that shouldn't have been overlooked by our server.  2) They never cleared our food. We were clearly done and had been for a while. When you're super full the last thing you want to look at is the remnants of what you just ate. Our server even gave us our bill, which we had to flag her down for, and didn't clear our plates then either. Baffling.  If you want delicious fall-off-the-bone pork bone soup, I would suggest trying it here. Don't expect miracles with most of the other dishes or the service."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean, authentic food, clean place , nothing fancy , but definitely good food - open 24 hours is a plus.. Pork bone soup is a must ..."}
{"text":"Do not go here for porkbone soup.  Any of the surrounding area porkbone soup is better than this place.  Also the Owl location at Christie and Bloor makes it properly.  Porkbone soup by definition should be a spicy broth rather than almost clear like this location preps.  If you ask for it to be spicier they simply put in thinly sliced green chilli peppers which I find simply insulting because it's not how it should be prepped.  I'm not sure why this location doesn't offer porkbone soup with a spicy broth.  Secondly as with all porkbone soup offered at Owl locations it's very heavy on fat.  Typically there's not as much fat present if you ever tried in Korea.   The other dishes at this place is just average.  But porkbone soup is simply prepped incorrectly here."}
{"text":"Great for late night meals. The food is above average compared to casual Korean restaurants in the area. The prices have gone up a little in the last year of so, but are still competitive.  The service is fast, even if the servers seem like they have not slept in a few days.  A big plus is the heavy amount of garlic they put in their dishes. The portions are also above average."}
{"text":"Decided to try this joint cause my usual spot (Ka Chi) was closed. I heard good things from other peeps so thought it was a worthy alternative for Pork Bone Soup. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed and still prefer Ka Chi.   There is however......A BIG HOWEVER. The place is open late (last call at 1:50AM) and something on the menu caught my eye. A bowl of Pork Bone Soup and 5....i say again...5 bottles of beers and all for $20. If i'm ever in need of a late night spot to throw a few back I'll be there!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was really not friendly. If  u only had 2 people,they will not let u set a table for 4."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were thinking where to eat and I thought I'd like to try this restaurant. It was my first time here and I ordered the pork bone soup as my friend recommended me. My boyfriend had the BBQ L.A beef ribs.the food was okay, it wasn't that bad for a first time.  I just think they need to make the place more inviting and they should replace their plastic cups as they look so old. Also, the pathway from the parking lot at the back going to the dining area is not so clean. I can see the staff cooking and preparing the food which they should be more careful. Because I would question if the food is clean."}
{"text":"Visitation was in a group of 5, Monday weekday around dinner time.  Ordered the pork bone soup (share-version), dumpling soup, spicy calimary stir fried dish, kim-chi pizza., and a spicy chicken on rice.  I haven't been to the other Owls, so I lack a frame of reference.  For a Monday night, they were not dead-still, which is a good sign.  The sole waiter was busy, but not so much that we were ignored for very long.  He was rather accommodating for various requests when we required additional items or water/tea or what not.  This is actually in contrast to a lot of other reviews I have seen of this place.  The food arrived hot and sizzling.  For the spicy dishes, the spiciness was definitely there, but not overpowering.  There was plenty of food for the 5 of us, including a lot of leftover rice.  I'm not a fan of the Kim-chi pizza, but the other diners thoroughly enjoyed it - personally I found it somewhat tasteless and doughy, although fresh cucumber strips were a nice touch.  The dumpling soup had a lot more rice-flour slices than dumplings, which themselves were somewhat thick in the wrap.  The core of the dinner should have been the pork bone soup.  Unfortunately, I found this dish was rather bland, plain, and not dripping with pork-bone-fat and flavour.  The large hotpot had about 6 bones - meaty, but not quite as much as other places.  They also filled the pot with a lot of, again, rice-flour discs.  Overall, it's nice to see more Korean options, especially for that pork-bone-soup staple.  I'll probably have to give it another go for the individual portion to make a more definitive judgement, but as it stands, I'd still rather drive a little further to Man Doo Hyang (http://www.yelp.com/biz/man-doo-hyang-mississauga) for a hot steamy bowl."}
{"text":"Love this place for late night or shall I say early morning pork bone soup.  Parking out back. Daily specials. Open 24hrs.  Generous portions. Tried pancakes. Kimchi fries rice. They are tasty. Bulgogi & Spicy chicken are alright.  Services is good. Nothing to complain about.  This place seems to be packed 24/7 doesn't matter if I come at 10pm or 2am."}
{"text":"Sh*tty, sh*tty service!!! So much so we could not enjoy the food. Not good enough to forget the awful service and there are other great Korean restos that are worth going to than having to experience another one like this."}
{"text":"Ok korean food place. Got the pork bone soup, my go-to whenever I come here. I guess most people like it here because it's conveniently open 24 hours, but I think that can affect the food quality. While I thought my pork bone soup was okay, my two friends didn't really enjoy their dishes as much. Prices were okay, some dishes are kind of overpriced."}
{"text":"Kam ja tang is a must try. Bibimbap is slightly oily. The side dishes here are not as plenty as their branch in Chinatown. Overall, just okay but I think the owl in Chinatown is better than this branch."}
{"text":"The food here isn't anything special however I would say that their service is top notch (all the waiters/waitresses also have flawless skin! omg Koreans!!) Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the food, I actually liked it but nothing really stood this place apart from all the others.  Oh also, they put on Music Core! For all them k-pop lovers (heart)   Anyways, pretty good bang for the buck and there's a reason why they are always so busy and you need to sit and wait when you first come in for a table.  Will be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"What to say...Pork bone soup is good but I won't go there again."}
{"text":"24hrs open, good sercive and affordable price.  hot soup is good for a man with cold."}
{"text":"Cold noodles....awesome!  I happily finished the bowl and could have had more!  And yes the pork bone soup is excellent as well but I feel like the weather in the summer is way too hot to eat something like that but hubby had no problems chowing down on that big pot of stew.    Spicy squid noodles was okay as was the seafood udon noodles.  But for me the winner was the cold noodle soup.  So refreshing!!!  Try it you're in for a treat!    The place is tiny.  Go for an early supper or a late night dinner.  By the time we left around 7:30 pm there was a line up.  Also there's only one high chair so if there's another kid using it you'll get a booster chair."}
{"text":"So great to have a place like this in Mississauga. Late night eats can be kind of slim pickings in this city, so a place that goes 24/7 is an amazing find. Some of the other reviews knock this place for its customer service (or lack thereof), but it's hard to do that for a place that's never closed.   I usually go with the gamjatang (pork bone soup) but on my most recent visit I went for some bibimbap (mixed rice with meat and veg). The quality is never a let down, and always delicious. Great value as well!   If I'm ever craving Korean food, this place is 100% my go-to!"}
{"text":"I first came here with my coworkers for lunch after setting up for a Korean festival (how fitting!) in 2011. It was here that I tried gamjatang and blood sausage for the first time. Being the inexperienced one, of course I'd be nowhere finished when everyone looked at me... Maybe I shouldn't have doubled my efforts to finish and then walk back to the festival...maybe I was feeling dangerous.  I fell in strong like with gamjatang. Blood sausage, meh not so much... /storytime  From the 1st time I've come here to the previous time (it's all a blur...), I will always remember the ultra busy staff who will try to accommodate you IF they have the chance. And if you speak Korean. But mostly if they have a chance -- it's always a busy place!   The portions are fulfilling (not too big, not too small), though a little on the salty side. Price is reasonable, and the staple gamjatang (which thankfully has no staples!) will always feature meat which can slide off the bones...and noticeable amounts of oil.  Beef bulgogi's sauce was a little on the syrupy side."}
{"text":"I honest don't know why people continue to go to this junk while there are many other cheaper, better Korean joints available two blocks north.  The food here is subpar with very limited side, and very overpriced!  Service is non-existent and customers are treated like shit.  I would have given this junk zero star if I could."}
{"text":"In Roman mythology, the Owl of Minerva or Owl of Athena symbolized wisdom and knowledge.  What that has to do with Korean comfort food served in a diner-like setting is beyond me - perhaps the food is meant to make you smarter or perhaps it's simply a wise decision to eat here if you are craving hearty Korean food served efficiently with no fuss. The restaurant is open 24 hours and is consistently busy.  There isn't much to say about the ambience or decor other than to say it's functional and diner-like. The service is prompt and efficient which is what you would expect. Generally, we come for the dish that this restaurant is probably best known for which is the Pork Bone Soup.  I have found that the quality of this dish has been consistently good every time I have ordered it.  There are good portions of meat on-the-bone which is easy to remove given how tender it is.  The flavour of the soup is fairly rich and good although I remember it being somewhat spicier in the past.  It is quite savoury and besides the meat, the soup has potato, vegetables, and perilla seeds.  It comes with a bowl of rice and you also get the obligatory side dishes which tend to come with any Korean meal.  For the side dishes or Ban Chan, you tend to get Kimchi along with 2 or 3 others. I have never been disappointed in ordering the Pork Bone Soup as it always leaves me satisfied and always hit's the spot when I am craving some hot, hearty, comfort food.  It also always leaves me quite full. The prices at this restaurant are very fair and just about everything on the menu would be considered a good value for the price. Lastly, the restaurant is licensed as they serve beer and soju. Perhaps the name is appropriate after all, as deciding on a meal of hearty Pork Bone Soup with a nice beer, can at times, be a wise choice indeed...."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre but the SERVICE WAS BAD. The older lady gave me attitude when I ordered and when I asked a question she rolled her eyes at me... Ok"}
{"text":"Owl of Minerva is exactly what it is expected to be. Its mediocre service and fairly decent food don't make it too memorable but its all-night service and big portions make it somewhere that my friends often frequent after a night out. If it's 3am and you're not sober, definitely recommend. Any other time, I'd say go try Ka Chi just down the street."}
{"text":"Gamjahtang = good cheap eat!  1) It's open late 2) It's comfort food that will taste the same every time you go 3) They have the best kimchi 4) It's quick, cheap and delicious"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for the first time for both of us. We arrived at 7pm on a Thursday night and had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The place was packed for a weekday evening. The decor is not fancy, just tables and chairs with two big tv screens showing CP24, a smaller tv with a changing screen of some of the food items on the menu and one wall with approximately 12 pictures, each displaying I guess the more popular food item with names. The menu was very pictorial so if you don't know the name of what you want, there are plenty of photos to help you.   We ordered the small kalbi (#7), a ground beef and egg with veggie bimimbop (#5) and a bulgogi mushroom soup (#13). The food was hot and delicious. The small kalbi came with two bowls of steamed rice and a miso soup. We got three or four large pieces on top of fried beansprouts. The broth in the bulgogi soup dish was a delicious sweet flavour. The bimimbop was colourful with a variety of tasty vegetables. We also got the usual sides dishes of kimchi, pickles, beansprouts and potatoes  .   We received two hot drinks which I thought was water but tasted more like rice tea. All the food coming out of the kitchen looked really delicious. I will definitely be coming back to try other dishes too."}
{"text":"Delicious! Came here with my family while visiting Toronto and we were definitely not disappointed. I'm gluten free and could eat the bibimbap no problem. Everyone in my family loved the bone soup. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Korean food and I'm particularly obsessed with ddeokboki (spicy rice cakes) so when I found out they have it here I was super freaking excited! This place is always very packed which meant service was slow and interrupted. They also got my order wrong twice which was unfortunate. However the ddeokboki was AMAZING so that made up for all the waiting. Definitely recommend if you're familiar with Korean food and looking for a quick fix for those cravings."}
{"text":"Haven't tried to dine in, so I can't really say how the service is. We only ordered take outs. Dishes taste really good and authentic. Also there portions are very generous. My favorite dishes are the kalbi, spicy rice cake and also the gamjatang is good too (I think this is one pf their popular dishes)."}
{"text":"The Owl in North York was a real treat with lots of good Korean food, so I was thrilled to find another Owl closer to home. Nope... not nearly as good. For starters, this place is in a Chinese mall, and I guess for that reason, many of their dishes are Chinese. That's disappointing for me because I love different Korean dishes, not just the pork bone soup and bibimbap, and they didn't have many Korean options outside of those. If I recall correctly, they didn't even have Korean chopsticks, and I saw the staff eating store-bought kimbap (wouldn't a legit Korean restaurant be able to slap a kimbap together with typical kitchen ingredients?) The prices at this location are also higher than North York. I found the dining space kind of cluttered, but the service was pleasant and efficient. The parking lot is a nightmare so make sure you wrap your entire vehicle in industrial-strength bubble wrap so you don't get it scratched by people backing out of spots without looking."}
{"text":"The quality of food compared to takeout is quite different. I enjoy eating the beef bulgogi which tastes really good, and also the pork bone soup. It is a good place to eat late at night but sometimes the service is lacking, and they forget stuff. The place isn't that clean but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Price: 4/5. Pretty decent for the amount of food you get. It's filling and it comes with 4 appetizers dishes.    Atmosphere: 4/5. There's a lot of sitting area. I've been here a few times for dinner and only had to wait for a table once.   Service: 4/5. The people that work there are super nice. Always comes around to see how the food is and for refill of drinks or appetizers. We got our food pretty fast too.   What we ate: 4/5. We got the seafood tofu soup which comes with rice. It's one of my favourites. We also got spicy bulgolgi which also comes with rice. It's delicious and we are always satisfied. Yum."}
{"text":"This place was open until 2am so my friends and I decided this was the place. We got one of the combos, fish roe soup and a bottle of soju, side of spicy rice cakes.  Food was SO spicy. I can hands spicy foods and go out for Korean frequently but this is the first time I couldn't handle it! I was disappointed since I could not eat my meal. Soju was okay, my friends liked it more than I did.  The staff was nice. It wasn't as packed as the place next door and they also we're cheaper. I wish they had different spice levels, would have given them a higher score.  The place itself is fairly clean... it could use a good rub down, the floor mainly. Bathrooms we're fine though.  Also, I LOVED that they had a tv playing Kpop MVs, though I didn't see any big name groups."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite korean restuarant. The service is good and the food is to die for. Would highly recommend to friends trying korean food for the first time."}
{"text":"Kam ja tang Kam  ja tang kam ja tang!   Everytime I come here I get the pork bone soup. One of the cheapest items on the menu but has loads of pork in a nice large spiced broth. Mind you its messy, but its a staple for me here. I've also tried the tddobokye.  (horrible spelling) its the rice cake and fish cake appetizer. It dressed in a nice red spicy sauce that goes great on your rice.   Ps this place is always busy so that's a good sign. But also only cash for less than $20 orders. Also doesn't take MasterCard. But visa and debit."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch. We have to say we may not come back. There are lots of other better choices in ktown. I had pan fried glass noodles with extra vegetables. It had a weird flavor of heavy cream.  My friend had their most famous pork and potato soup, that was not hot enough, piece on the very top was even cold."}
{"text":"RUDE STAFF. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND NOT MAKING THEIR CUSTOMERS HAPPY.   Waited in line to be seated just for the staff to let a group of customers who just came in have the next available table. Her reasoning was she cant give us the table coz there's only 3 of us and there's 5 of them. Not going back there!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem for Korean food! There's a reason why there's always a line up to get in - 2 things - pork bone soup and la Kalbi beef. So flavourful without being overpowering! DEFINITELY worth the wait!!   I've also tried the rice cakes which are also stellar. The servers are attentive which is a major plus!"}
{"text":"There a bunch of Owl locations in the GTA, so if you've been to one you know what to expect. I've only ordered the gamjatang (pork bone soup) and I find it a little too salty. Also the portion is smaller than other places (usually 2 bones instead of the standard 3+) and they only give about 4 side dishes. But it's open 24/7 so if you're looking for food late at night it'll hit the spot. Overall if you're looking for lunch or dinner I think there are better options for Korean food in the area."}
{"text":"Environment:  A place for food fast, very busy, pretty loud. Real authentic Korean food.   Food: Heard about owl but food just As good as other Korean place, nothing stand out."}
{"text":"this place is good, and open 24 hours I believe. Great atmosphere, kinda crowded but cozy. Food is what I would imagine Korean comfort food is like. For my first Korean food experience I was pleasantly surprised, I got a dish that had spicy fried rice, rice cakes, pork and a fried egg on top and I highly recommend it. I also love the variety in the menu and the bottomless green tea offered. The meals come with some sides like kimchi. (speaking of the kimchi fried rice is incredible). You pay up at the counter."}
{"text":"Among my friends I'm probably the only one who really really likes this place. The food is always fresh and they're open 24/7. I have tried this place at different times and different hours and every time I was given the same good quality Korean food. This is a very reliable Korean restaurant that caters to a lot of Korean locals, and for a non Korean I find the food very tasty.   My favorite is Combo #1, which is a soup with a lot of meat. This is really famous and it's a big portion. My second choice is the sizzling chicken plate.  Be sure to ask for the vegetable plate as well (this is part of the combo if you're there for lunch and early dinner)  The only thing you want to consider is to bring your google translator (on ur phone) with you if you don't exactly know what you want to just level the language barrier."}
{"text":"Great gem in the middle if Mississauga. They are open 24 hours . I went there at 1pm.  Great staff very friendly and super fast. The restaurant was clean . I had Gamjatang or pork bone soup . It was a great size meal . Very tasty the only down fall it was not spicy enough.  I will return there are many items I would love to try. Lunch was $7.99 with a tea . See picture."}
{"text":"Main dishes are tasty and the environment is pleasantly familiar; however, the best thing about eating at a Korean restaurant are the quality and quantity of the side dishes. At this restaurant the quantity and quality are just not there. Side dishes are bland and tasteless, gives you the impression that some teenager who didn't want to do the chore was given the task of preparing them. I have visited a couple of the other sucursals of this chain and it's the same tasteless side dishes, I never touch them. Anyways, if you are looking for a hangover soup this is the place, and it's always open, which is a serious plus and a high five."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Owl of Minerva chains now and it is what you would expect from a chain; standard and consistent quality. Having been introduced to Korean cuisine scene in Toronto for a while now, the banchan that's offered definitely feels underwhelming in terms of choice, flavour and variety. The spicy chicken that I ordered was quite tasty and you'll definitely feel the spice! I wish they served it with the multi-grain rice without the premium charge."}
{"text":"This was an excellent find for us!! The food was fantastic, the service was prompt and friendly, and the portions are huge and well-priced. The kimchi is really good (they give you kimchi and assorted pickled veg as sides, and bring you more if needed. We got the kampung ghi (hot and sour chicken, my spelling is probably way off!), the fried beef dumplings and the bulgogi. I've had better bulgogi, but it was still excellent. I don't know why so many comments said the staff aren't friendly- we were greeted with a smile, the servers were fast, and super nice. I love that it's 24 hours, we will definitely be back. Our entire bill was $45 with tax and it was a LOT of food!"}
{"text":"This 24-hour chain store has been so successful, they're opening their own meat shop next door.  Owls is most known for the Kam Ja Tang (Pork bone soup) and for the fact that they're open 24-hours. The dish itself is A-OK, and comes out pretty fast since everyone is ordering it.   There is parking at the rear, or you can opt for street parking. I believe they also offer delivery services since I see vans with their company logo zooming about the city.   Overall, Owls is a safe bet if you're getting hungry late at night."}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty.  I've had a few of their menu items including the famous Pork Bone Soup and everything is reliably good.  It might be a bit salty in general, not good if you're trying to limit sodium intake.  But other than that, I think this is the perfect meal for a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"it was not as great as people say it is, i had the gam ja tang bone soup and it was very bland and plain, not filling at all, i was hungry after still"}
{"text":"A good run of the mill Korean eat and go restaurant.  Nothing fancy in terms of decor and layout.  It's a place you come and grab a bite not to have a nice romantic dinner.  The seating is very closed together so if you are not comfortable possibly bumping into your neighbours then this place might not be for you.  It is a very busy place especially on weekends. They are open 24/7 so it is very convenient if you need a late night snack.  Don't expect fancy service but they are fast and friendly.  English is not most of the servers first language but they don't have problems taking orders.  With all the boiling soups, it could get pretty hot in there especially when it's hot and humid outside.  Although their most tasty pork bone soup (Gam Ja Tang) makes it worth the sweat.  This seems to be their most popular dish as it can be seen on almost every table.  If you like Korean food, this is definitely a place that will satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food.   Warning, cash only but there is an ATM on site.     Delicious simple freshly made Korean delights.    Had the bulgogi and it was delicious"}
{"text":"No wonder this place has low rating.  We were gonna go to paldo besides owl, but it was fully booked so we went to owl instead. Owl is always good we thought. Wrong! The menu were different from other owls we've been to. I thought it is cool to try out some different dishes, so I ordered a mushroom and squid(there's option with bulgogi) stew. I wasn't expecting much, but when I got he stew I was pretty disappointed. There were \"sprinkles\" of squid in it, probably 2 tablespoons of it, and very few thinly sliced mushroom, I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a full mushroom in it. Then the rest were tofu, bean sprout, lots of onion and some zucchini. Why is it not named bean sprout and onion stew?!?!?!? Also, it was supposed to be a stew, but tasted very light like vegetable broth. Paid 10 bucks for this, pretty pricey for what I got.  I could've gone to bukchangdong soon tofu(which was across the street!) for a better tofu stew that actually taste amazing and cheaper with fast service.  The stir fried squid was not bad, it was weird that they don't have stir fried chicken which is usually a regular dish at owl.  The service of this place was good, but the food took pretty long, around 20mins. Banchan were not served until 5 mins before the dishes came, not a big deal though. The food though...made me double check if this was an owl knock off. Really didn't like my food, will not come back again."}
{"text":"It's a pretty packed place, however, the service here is friendly, fast (it's a very go-go-go type atmosphere), and attentive (they kept refilling tea constantly). Don't think it's the best Korean food in Mississauga (in my heart that title goes to Buk Chang Soon Tofu on Hurontario and some other local joints on Dundas St), but definitely offers a lot of variety and satisfies my craving.   Their specialty is Kamjatang (pork bone soup) as others mentioned, however I did not try this! I saw someone order Kalbi and it looked good!  I ordered Ramen ($5.99) and Japchae (~$8?) to share. I liked the Japchae, and the portion was pretty big too which is good for sharing. The ramen was fine in flavour (not as spicy as I thought) - the pot was a bit shallow and so the portion was smaller than I expected. Interesting that it says it has beef dumplings, but when it came, I only saw 1 beef DUMPLING (singular).   It's not expensive, but I think there is a slight markup compared to some other Korean places (ie. Kamjatang is $7.99 compared to maybe $5.99 at local joints). However, if you're in the area and crave Korean (and there's not too much of a wait), I would say this restaurant has enough variety to keep you happy, especially in the cold winter months."}
{"text":"Always quite busy at Owl of Minerva (North York) and right in the heart of Koreatown. Pork bone soup is definitely the fan favourite and it is very tasty, the broth is flavourful. They also have quite a few other food items that I have yet to try. It's 24/7 so I come here whenever I have the munchies or am just looking for a late night meal with friends. They serve alcohol such as beer and soju, so that's a plus. Also told there is free parking at the back. The service is really quick and the only downside is they accept debit/credit with orders over $20. You will definitely come out smelling like Korean food after!"}
{"text":"I always get the pork bone soup and can never go wrong with this. I come here once a week and even though it's so busy, it is totally worth it. It's reasonably priced and the staff are super nice! I've become a regular! The pork bone soup is a perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants I've been to, this place has the WORST customer service! My friends and I (a group of 6) are waiting at our table to be served for about 10+ minutes! The restaurant wasn't even busy! I guess their only excuse is the fact that they are open 24/7 so they must be really tired. If they can't handle the hours, then they shouldn't be open 24/7.  The food is average, mediocre at best. I ordered 2 dishes: the pork bone soup and bulgogi (grilled marinated beef) which was okay but I've had better. They also provide you with appetizers such as kimchi, radishes, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. One of my friends ordered the ramen but he was really disappointed because it was just instant ramen with meat and vegetables thrown in.  When the bill came, we asked for separate bills but they said they don't do separate bills. It's also CASH ONLY. This was really inconvenient because some of us have cash and the others have debit/credit. They have an ATM machine but it charges you a fee when you withdraw money.  I'll probably never come here again because of the terrible customer service and average food."}
{"text":"Owl of Minerva is a solid no frills Korean food that's open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Everyone from Toronto knows about this Korean chain and it's numerous locations (K-town, North York, etc). It's not fancy by any means, but the convenience of its many locations and flexible hours makes it a huge draw, especially after a late night out.  They have a pretty extensive menu with pretty much all the Korean food you could possibly think of. I would describe their food as \"basic\", but in a good sense. Nothing fancy, simple presentation (only 4 ban chan dishes are included), but solid taste-wise. I tried their beef bulgogi which was decent. I liked the fact that there was some jap chae noodles and vegetables mixed in with the meat.   The pork bone soup is where it's at though. During my last visit, I think 75% of the restaurant customers ordered that dish. Sadly, I haven't tried it for myself. The ban chan is disappointing though, with only 4 offerings: kim chi, sprouts, cucumber and pickled radish. You can't really complain, because the pricing is fair and food comes out quickly.   *3.5 stars*"}
{"text":"This is a reliable place to go late at night for a warm bowl of pork bone soup.  The soup is tasty, the side items are a welcome addition and value for the dollar is top-notch.  If it is late and I want Korean, this is where I go."}
{"text":"Ok here it goes.....   I came here a while back.  I remember ordering chap jae ( Korean noodle dish) from here, without meat.  The chap jae tasted ok, but what turned me off was the grease. I tilted my plate and you wouldn't believe the amount of oil that came out. I just could not eat  the dish because I know I will get an upset tummy later from the grease. Even the person I was dining with was shocked by the amount of oil too. I have not gone back ever since. Everything on the menu is practically meat (good to know if you are vegetarian).   The good things: 24 hrs which is convenient, and the staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Got some amazing late night food from here, would try it again as their menu offers a wide selection  of different Korean and Japanese food. Friend, fast and since this location is open 24/7 it's definitely a gem."}
{"text":"There's a 7 foot tall air conditioning unit tucked by a corner with a piece of paper taped onto it which reads; \"DON'T TOUCH!\" There are boxes of cabbage lined by the rear entrance which anyone can just take and run. There's a huge BBQ and a patio space at the rear entrance which is not used..ever. Owl of Minerva, everybody knows this place, am I the only one who notices that it's falling apart, with completely under-utilized real estate?  This is a 24 hour restaurant, and it doesn't get going until the wee hours.  Some people come here for Korean dishes, most just come here for the pork bone & potato soup...kamjatong I think it's spelt.  It's messy business, but somehow it fills you, and the price ain't anything to lose sleep over.  I am just glad that it's uptown where its impossible for the hipster to pedal their vintage bikes to.   The door chimes each time it's opened, and there will always be someone to greet you from far back behind the counter...unless you're homeless. I once witnessed a drunk man who was probably homeless dressed in dirty clothes enter the door, and the Korean woman emerged from behind the counter charging at him with great authority, and literally shooed him out like a raccoon!   \"No...NOO!\" She shouted, waving the back of her hand as if gesturing to a dog. My friend and I burst out in hysterical laughter at the sight as the man was humiliated back onto the street to which he came.  Then the lady smiled at us sightly embarrassed, and went back to work. It was Gangster!    Most other times it's a slightly mundane atmosphere, as most patronage are of the after hour slightly intoxicated night-life bunch,  but I did come here a few times for leisure.  I remember ordering the popular Korean alcohol beverage Soju once, and the waitress lady asked me which kind.  I didn't know that there were two kinds, and for a moment I was speechless.  Then I reached up and pointed to the advertisement poster on the wall with the famous Korean female pop star holding her bottle and I said; \"Hyori!\" Everybody laughed, I was corrected on my pronunciation and she went along to retrieve my drink with a wide smile spread across her face.  I must say, that was a moment of genius.   The fried dumplings are pretty good, I just usually stick to that and the kamjatong.  This place is kind of a last resort for me, but among last resorts..Owl comes first...."}
{"text":"Bless this 24 hour establishment! Highly, HIGHLY recommend the sizzling beef short ribs! One of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Got the pork bone soup and the spicy beef glass noodles. Taste was meh. And the place looked dirty. Came home and felt really nauseous a few hours later. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Korean food, but I love owl! There dishes are tasty! Pork bone soup is a must and it's one of the cheapest dish on the menu. And my second favourite is their kimchi fried rice. Yummmm! Their service is 3/5, but all the boys servers are extremely polite."}
{"text":"I changed my review to 1 star as I have tried every single Korean place in K-town and have discovered many places that are FAR better than here. Their food is subpar, but bonus is that they are open late - except many places are also open late in the same area, so I'm not even sure if it's worth it."}
{"text":"YES!! They have finally opened an Owl in Mississauga. Though it is not yet comparable to it's downtown and uptown counterparts, it still has the same great tasting gamjatang as the others. It is not open late like the downtown location though."}
{"text":"The 9 of us came by for a late dinner (12am) and lucky us, got a table immediately. I remember loving the pork bone soup (10 years ago) so naturally, 7/9 of us got it. I am definitely disappointed. It wasn't what I remembered it being! It was so flavourless, not spicy, meat was soft but no pork flavour. I hope this is a one off because where else am I going to get PBS at 3am!?"}
{"text":"Me and my friend ordered beef ribs (LA Kalbi) last week and it was just perfectly done. The chicken sizzler I took was great too, with the right combination and amount of side veggies. The warm herbal tea was one of the best I tasted and complemented the food."}
{"text":"It used to be great.  I used to order just 1 big item to share but the last time I did that the waitress/busgirl/owner gave me very dirty looks and charged extra for sharing.  When I protested that this had never happened before they just dissed me off by not speaking English.  Loved the food and still do but it was very uncomfortable from the moment we ordered.  Unfortunately we won't be coming here again.  By the way, their TV volume is way too loud."}
{"text":"24 hours, fast service, delicous pork bone soup and Korean tv.  I've been going to this joint since I moved here, and it's been the food that keeps me coming back.  Don't bother ordering anything except the kam ja tang, or pork bone soup, as it's what they do best, really it's the only thing anyone orders."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is that it's open 24/7. When nowhere else in Mississauga is open, you can still get comfy Korean food here. It's a great late night spot, and still very family friendly."}
{"text":"Though it's probably not one of the most authentic around, you can find me here slurping on the SoonDaeGuk, SoonDubu, and sometimes the BiBimBap and Spicy chicken. This place is 24 hrs which makes it a go-to for Korean by default. The service is quick and pretty courteous and food quality is consistently savoury.   No qualms about this place except that side dishes could be served as apps instead of with the meal."}
{"text":"The side plate smell like sanitizer??The server  has wired attitude. The side dishes just a little types?and tast not good?The pork bone soup is okay."}
{"text":"Tastes very different from the ones in dt. The pork bone soup is 7.99 which is more expensive than other locations and seemed lack of flavor. The place is packed everyday right now since it just opened, so dinner time would be a 20min wait. Also the day I went, they only offered two side dishes which is different than the 4-5 dishes offered at other owl locations. Finally the restaurant is only open till 10pm on Sunday-Thursday which is very early. I would recommend the korean town owl over this one."}
{"text":"One of my favorite 24h places in mississauga. A welcome alternative to fast good on late evenings. This is a typical Korean place (actual Korean,  not Chinese pretending to be Korean) with many traditional dishes. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. When I am not too hungry, I get the dumplings. When I feel like eating more, one of the various \"boqoki\"  (or however it is spelt)  dishes are my typical pick. I enjoy the spices dishes, but my stomach does not agree, so I usually get the less than spicey variants. This decore needs work, but for the price, it is sufficient. Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to the Owl of Minerva for an early dinner while he was visiting the North York area. It was around 6:00pm, and the restaurant was reasonably busy but not incredibly packed.  Ambiance: Casual and fairly noisy, considering that the restaurant was not even full yet. I believe there were two televisions in the restaurants, both tuned to the same show on a Korean channel. The walls are covered with photos of their dishes, which is actually quite helpful when trying to decide what to order.   Service: The staff were quite friendly, and the service was pretty speedy and efficient. There is a bell parked beside the table to call the waiter, although I didn't need to use it that day. There are a number of quirks about this restaurant, but not enough that I wouldn't come again. One of these quirks include the fact that they do not allow you to split the bill (one bill per table) and I'm not sure why this is the case.   Food: The food was piping hot, and everything turned out well. I had the JeYukBokeum (stir fried marinated pork with spicy sauce on sizzling plate) and my boyfriend tried the Dolsot BiBimBap (vegetables and ground beef with rice in a hot stone bowl). The pork was really flavorful, served with a generous amount of vegetables (green peppers and onions).   Great Korean food, right in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup here is very good. The meat is meaty, as opposed to fatty, so there are no chunks of fat floating around in the broth, just good meat. It comes with rice and two side dishes (kimchi and radish). I got it to go and it was packed well. Super cheap as well ... $10 and change.  It's not the best gamjatang I've ever had but it hits the spot."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten something so spicy that you felt like you were transported to another dimension? Last night, I had an out-of-body experience when I ate the kimichi jigae. My husband loves this place. In fact, he had the kimichi jigae just a few days previous to last night. I decided to have a go. I ordered the kimichi jigae without tuna or pork. Maybe they figured that as a subsitute, I'd like more chilis or maybe because I'm asian, they figured I could hack it. They don't have the heat rating like Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. If they did, I would've ordered mine a couple notches above \"white\".  I don't tend to sweat a lot and I came into the restaurant feeling really chilly. After eating a few bites of the jigae, I had beads of sweat forming on my forehead and my nose was leaking like a drippy faucet. How is spicy food suppoed to be an aphrodisiac? What's so sexy about sweating from every orifice and having a runny nose? It tasted good though although I did lose sense of my tasebuds after awhile since the heat killed them. The little free appetizers helped cool things down a bit.  My husband told me that you can get beers here and they leave the beer caps on. Good idea if you've missed the boat on the beer store. just grab a bunch of beers and take 'em to go with your kimichi jigae. you'll need it to cool your tongue down!"}
{"text":"I love pork bone soup. The pork bone soup in Toronto is actually better than the ones in Korea. There were times where I ate pork bone soup three times a day at Owl of Minerva. That being said, I haven't been to this location for many years mainly because you can get pork bone soup anywhere now days. Yesterday I decided to take my family here for pork bone soup. The food quality was on par with other places but the price was on the stiff side. The price was over $12 for a pork bone soup before TIP. I understand that minimum wage has gone up but the cost to make this soup is less than $2 a bowl. Pork bone soup used to be more like $6.99 before tax and tip. When I started eating pork bone soup back in the days in Korean town (Christie) they used to give extra meat and rice for free of charge. It's kind of sad to see the value proposition on pork bone soup has changed entirely. It's supposed to be cheap and filling food! I hope the owner of Owl of Minerva realizes the true strength of this soup."}
{"text":"It's honestly not the best looking place, nor does the food look AS appetizing, however I will say, you can't go wrong with their pork bone soup for $9.99 which actually comes with a LOT of meat. I would say the meat to rice ratio was definitely off - I finished my rice before the meat which tells you there was plenty to go around.  The reason for my rating is due to its unappealing aesthetic and the service was pretty lazy - asked for napkins, didn't come. Asked for water, didn't come until asking a second time for each. Wouldn't really recommend this place since there's TONNES of better Korean places to eat."}
{"text":"I first started coming to this location a few years back because I used to drive near here a few times a week. Now I don't visit here anymore because it has gone completely downhill.  It gets way too busy on the weekend and holidays. The service becomes lazy and they forget about giving you drinks and appetizers.  All their food no longer acquires the taste and flavours it once did. Their soups lack salt and spicy pepper. The pork in their pork bone soup has more bone than meat. If there is any meat, it's just not fall-off-the-bone anymore. They skimmed out some of their seafood in their Soon Tofu Soup. Just an awful way to turn away loyal customers. That's why I haven't bothered to upload any photos here. But hey, if you're in the area at 3am and hankering for some late night Korean food, they are open 24 hrs for your convenience.  Trust me when I say that the Oakville location is far better and yes I have written a review on them - with photos.

{"text":"Whenever someone tells you \"you must try\" the pork bone soup at the Owl of Minerva, kindly ask what time they ate there.  Sure, the Owl serves a decent pork bone soup. But it's only really worth a rave after 2am (when the better spots a few metres away close shop) and after a few drinks. Kinda like a lot of 24-hour joints, availability plays a serious factor in rating the quality. And I don't know of a lot of 24-hour Korean places if you catch my drift. Still, if you have a hankering post-bar, GO! You're sure to have company, since I've seen people through the window slurping up the (overly clear) broth as late/early as 5am. Personally though, I'd rather a snack and wait for one of the many, many better options."}
{"text":"Love how they are open late......pork bone soup is so amazing after a night out!  It's a bit too salty but honestly, at 4am, you don't really care anymore haha...."}
{"text":"There should always be rating perks for 24-hour operations, not to mention the gamjatang is truly delicious, especially late at night.  Special note to the pork shoulder combo - that's good chow for middle of the day."}
{"text":"We came on a weekday and waited for the order for 30'. We asked the waitress about the food and she kept saying that it was coming. Many people came after us finished their meals. They didnt even give us the side dishes. Very bad service and the food quality has gone down compared to before."}
{"text":"Their pork bone soup is really good and served bubbling hot.  Service is usually really fast."}
{"text":"There is no better place for late night Korean food after a club.  The food here is authentic Korean and everything from the side dishes are delicious!  My favourite and the most famous meal on the menu here is their pork bone soup.  It comes with a select amount of side dishes such as kimchi, potatoes, bean sprouts, etc. and they refill them as you eat.  The pork bone meat is fall off the bone goodness and I often pick every last bit as it tastes so good!  All in all they are a great place to eat and very inexpensive for a Korean restaurant in Toronto.  Probably my favourite Korean place to eat and the fact they are open late night all week is a bonus.  Can't wait for my next trip back here!"}
{"text":"I had a spicy grilled chicken meal. Problem was, the meal was almost all onions and green peppers with very little actual chicken. I estimate 4 small pieces of chicken.  I've been the Owl of Minerva in the downtown Koreatown and it's fine. But up here, they skimp on the meat and screw you.  Never again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was good. I always choose to have korean food every time I come to use laundry service at 24 Hour Coin Laundromat. What kind of food I should eat in this area right? Korean food is inexpensive, fast and comes with small side dishes which are my favourite. I usually stick with my tofu or kimchi soup. I like spicy and sour taste. So it was perfect for me, especially in the winter. I also got a stir fried squid dish this time. It was very tasty but I couldn't finish it. The server was polite and helpful. I hope I will get this kind of service again when I come back next time. PS. I asked for more side dishes and the server gave me a lot of them! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Seems like the place to go after a late night in Korea town. Came here on Friday night for a feast, with the Pork Bone Soup, the Pork Belly Sharing plate and the Sausage thing. Everything was good with lots and lots of spice and service was prompt! Lots of good banchan as well."}
{"text":"I checked this place out with my wife. She got the beef soup and I got the pork bone soup. Both were good. I would definitely make this one of my must go spots for Korean food!"}
{"text":"Cheap food, check. Popular with the locals, check. Good portions, check. Parking availability, check? Well, it was definitely a check for us when we showed up and there was street parking right infront of the place.   Owl is a staple for my visits to Toronto. Now with several locations open, you can easily get pork bone soup whenever you want and where ever you want. They used to have the marinated sweet potatoes as a side-dish, but didn't have them this time around. Regardless, food portions are great, and prices for their all day menu is more than reasonable. Plus, they're open crazy late, so when the craving hits, you know you've always got a friend at Owl! But not a really long term friend, since they kind of rush you out. Just saying."}
{"text":"This place is closer to 3 1/2*. The Owl is a restaurant known for Korean comfort soups and stews especially their Gamjatang (Pork Bone Stew). This restaurant is located in a very busy area with limited parking in the back lot and street parking only available during certain times of the day. They also have other locations throughout GTA and surrounding areas. This place is open 24 hours. The later it is, the busier this restaurant gets. You could be waiting to get seats during their busy times. Service is okay and even though the place is not dirty, it doesn't feel clean either.   I come here for their Pork Bone Stew. The dish is very good and it is the restaurant calling card. It is well worth it to come to try it out. They are very generous with the meat and the broth is very flavorful. They also have other Korean dishes like bibimbap and naengmyeon. The customers are not mostly Koreans so it should tell you about the popularity of this place."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is so bad. Never saw such bad attitude before.   Basically no service. I have to fill up water by myself. I even have to ask for spoons.  Won't come here anymore."}
{"text":"This is the best late night Asian food in Mississauga. Everything is tasty, prices are great and everyone is friendly. Place is a little tight and I feel like it could be a little cleaner though.  The pork bone soup and the Kalbi beef is the best."}
{"text":"This has always been my go to place when I was still going to UofT downtown.  Still a go to for late nights Pork Bone Soups and Spicy Tteok-bokki (right way to write \"Dukbokki\" according to Korean friends) or Spicy rice cakes   However the soups have been consistently getting less and less flavourful and even when I asked for spicy - it wasn't even spicy... weird right? Not spicy spicy Kamjatang. Tsk tsk  But I will still comeback at 2-3am and get it."}
{"text":"In search of the best pork bone soup in downtown Toronto I head to The Owl of Minerva in Ktown, or \"The Owl\" as it says on their sign outside. Their pbs is definitely one of the meatier ones I've tried. The broth had a nice hearty flavor and the meat was fall-off-the-bone good but there were no veggies like the typical potatoes or cabbage in most pork bone soups to balance it out. The place only takes cash but is open 24 hours so it's a great late night place to get some pretty decent Korean comfort food."}
{"text":"I've been to a few koren and tried a few dishes. My friends brought me to Owl, which I really enjoyed. Bi Bam Bap in a stone bowl is a delicious and healthy choice. I've also tried their Pork Bone Soup which is filling yet satisfying as well. If you're in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"First of all this place is in dire need of some renovations. Upkeep of a restaurant is very important to me and this place just looks run-down and messy. The furniture is run-down, the walls are run-down and the floors are run-down, just horrible! Even the dishes were falling apart.  Just ordered the pork bone soup, honestly nothing special just standard stuff. I feel like the prices have definitely gone up and I believe the pork bone soup is cheaper at some of the neighbouring places. I couldn't even find a piece of potato.  The service was really meh. You can tell I really don't like this place. They have a small selection of side dishes (This is why I come to Korean restaurants, side dishes!!!) We came in from the back entrance and it smelled kind of funny. I really hope I don't have to come back because someone in my group thinks this is the best place for pork bone soup!"}
{"text":"At around 12midnight, we were hungry  and was craving for anything soup. Yelp brought us here and couldn't be any happier. Thank God they are open 24/7. We got here and to our surprise there's a lot of people dining at that time. We still can't get over how cheap the food is in Canada so we found the prices here to be really cheap. At least compared to what We're used to. So we got their popular #1 which is  pork bone soup that's a little spicy with potatoes and rice and some veggies in it. Omg!! This is super flavorful. The bones had so much meat in it. It was just perfect. The meat was literally falling off the bones. We also got their small kalbi which is still a huge portion. The meat was cooked well and very tendet. And we got the donkatsu which is breaded pork. Unfortunately we only got to eat a few pieces of this because we were already full with the rest of our order. The service was great. The food is beyond excellent. I highly recommend it here and will be back when we're in Toronto"}
{"text":"Backyard free parking is awesome.  Service is sweet.  Soup is gorgeous and fairly priced."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was decent. We ordered the spicy rice cakes and a few meat dishes. You could definitely find better, but that doesn't make the food here bad. What can be really terrible here is service. We were here twice (though to two different chains), the first time a Korean friend ordered in Korean and the second time we had to do without a native speaker. The second time was at this spot. Water was never refilled and it took over 30 minutes to catch someone's attention so we could pay. I will say that our order came quickly though. This would be 3 stars for food (it's a-okay!) but considering service, a 2 seems about right."}
{"text":"Food is soooo good!  Grabbed takeout, got spicy bulgogi...a bit oily which is why I had to give it 4 stars but still always good!  Can't go wrong with 24 hour Korean food restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food after a night out drinking. The pork bone soup is hearty and delicious. Really great on a cold night as well.  Ambiance is definitely not 5 star but it's do-able."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in for dinner as we were starving! We got sat quite fast considering the restaurant was busy. My girlfriend ordered pork bone soup which was the main reason why we stopped by, because she loves it! :) so i tried a new item on the menu and an app for the both of us. Food came really fast both the app and the main entrees.   The app was good, my girl friend finished her pork bone, but i didnt take more than 4 bites out of my noodle soup. It was bland and tasteless. I forget the name of my entree but it read noodles,mixed veggies and chicken broth. It was like ordering water off the menu for $8.99 because the soup was like water, no flavour at all, chicken broth i got in my noodle soup was certainly less than an ounce which is really misleading and annoying. It was like 5 pieces of chicken the size of your pinky nail... I told one of the servers about my experience with the meal and he obnoxiously, rudely and un hesitantly said I can't order something on the menu and say you dont like it.. He insisted that i had to pay for it and made a scene knowing the restaurant was kinda packed. I of-course felt uncomfortably and did not want to pay for something that i did not enjoy and on top of all, it was a new item on the menu. Service went horrible after that.. We left no tip at all. Ruined our day because the server attacked my girlfriend with the same speech..  After an annoying lecture about what we ordered and what WE did wrong.. We decided to pay for the bill and leave no tip.  Definitely not coming back here EVER.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for more than 10 years - yes, no exaggeration, I have been living in the vicinity since 2000 and this is the go-to restaurant for me like many. It's not bad, but more like hit or miss. Most of the time I would just go for the Pork bone soup since it's cheap and fast - let's just say the difference between hit or miss is more like day and night. Sometimes it is absolutely amazing, fresh and tasty, so savory that I wouldn't trade it for almost anything else. Sometimes it's tasteless, over cooked, and a complete bowl of cabbage and minced potato (or no potato at all). Honestly it depends on the time of the day, number of customers present, or I guess the mood of the server/cook? Anyhow, at 11:00 pm tonight it was an absolute disaster, I would guess more than 500g (and yes that's a complete bowl) of cabbage, I'm not even kidding, check out my picture. There was like no spice/red in the soup (I'm guessing it has been so long since it was cooked that everyone else got the spices?). Jesus, you gotta be kidding me, owl. You make so much money that you even have frozen meals at T&T supermarket! If the soup has been there for so long, throw it out and make another one could you? I mean it's like your signature dish that is lit in neon on your window for over 20 years, at least don't screw up this bad. Anyway, sometimes I would just go next door since they have more side dishes and although don't have that \"high\" of a ceiling but more often than not would not be such a disaster. Won't be back for a while but I'm sure I'll visit again. Peace   P.S. I'm sure the first time I visited the owl, I didn't even speak a shred of English. And now I just wrote the pants off this review. Thanks Owl, I salute you."}
{"text":"Open 24hrs a day Friendly service They make a mean bowl of Gamjatang  Yummy Soondae Reasonably priced  I really like this owl location over the one dt, its close to home, and I can get my groceries at BTrust after having a hearty bowl of Pork Bone Soup."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is ok, but I can get the same at a lower price at food court like First Markham Place. Besides, service is horrible. The old waitress here is rude. She insisted to take my credit card and pay the bill by herself.   Horrible service! Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there with my Pork Bone Soup buddy, since like many of you, we are in the look out for the best PBS place in the city... fail to find that, then for the best and most convenient to get to PBS place in the city. So it is a win-win!  So we tried this place a while back. What a dumpy looking place, it really looks like... what am saying this places is on par with most places on Korean town.  However, who cares about the decor when we are looking for quality, comfort food. I mean, if I had my way, I would show up in my pajamas, just have the soup and then head back home, and flop the couch and enjoy a lazy Sunday afternoon reading.   Anyway, one thing I have noticed with restaurants is that all of them have  their own take on this staple Korean dish.   For example Two Thumps up is big on the peppercorn, Ka-Chi is big on the potato, Seoul Restaurant for example uses less peppercorn and some ginger, while Owl of Minerva forgoes the Ginger and focuses on the stew, low fat pork and with the peppercorn. By the way, I cannot stress how little fat (and my soup in particular less meat) than expected the way it is made here.   Personally, I am not a huge fan of peppercorn even though I do not mind it. Did I find the soup tasty? Yes, I did.   Would I come again? Yes. Especially if I get a craving at 11:00pm+!"}
{"text":"Best korean food out there! I've been there countless times. The food is worth the price, the portions are filling. Service is fast. Highly recommend this place if you're craving korean food, or if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and you're a late night kind of individual than this place is worth checking out. Don't expect much with their service bc you will be disappointed. They're open 24/7.   Personally, when I find a dish I like I just stick to it. My choices are bulgogi and their seafood tofu soup. They also give you free small side dishes, I don't like kimchi or any of their sides except their pickled cucumber which is so good. It's pickled and the cucumber is so crunchy and refreshing. Also, I like multigrain rice and they have it here for an extra charge.   Their prices are a bit high but that's like any shoppers that's 24 hours...its jacked up.   I've eaten at a few Korean joints and other owl minera and find the food here suits my taste buds best."}
{"text":"I used to love this place till they decreased portion and jacked up the cost of everything. Its now unaffordable for me and im sad :( good food tho"}
{"text":"Does one get a prize for visiting all the Owl of Minervas in the GTA?   I was having my monthly pork bone soup craving and just had to check this one out. It's steps from Christie station and open 24-hours.   Pork bone soup: tastes exactly like all the other locations. AMAZING. My friend ordered the pork hock which turned out to be slices of salty, pickled pork hock on top of the bone. It was a huge pile of meat. I thought it was too salty, he loved it.   The atmosphere is busy and there's constantly a lineup of one or two people. Luckily, most people come to eat and run, so the wait isn't more than a few minutes. Like the other locations, there's a TV showing Korean variety shows on all the time.  Also, of you get a spot by the wall, there are a few electrical outlets, say if your iphone runs out of juice and you just happen to have your wall charger with you..."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Yonge and Finch location religiously. This is the first time I've gone to the Bloor location. Customer service here is MUCH better - very friendly male workers. However, the pork bone soup wasn't as good (still enjoyable though) and I was disappointed that they didn't have the pickled cucumbers like Yonge and Finch location has. They only accept cash here."}
{"text":"OMGGGGG the besttttttttt Korean food I've had so far. #16 and #19 is a musstttt try. I was full 20 minutes ago and can't put my bowl down. MUST TRY. Going to be coming here alottt."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed things about Owl so I decided to come here and give you all the real deal: my review! I came here solo during lunchtime and was seated right away. I got the kimchi stew with pork (you can also get it with tuna). The banchan was: kimchi, pickled radish, pickled cucumber, and bean sprouts. Each side dish was delicious and tasted just a little bit different from its squad.  Onto the star of the show: the kimchi stew. I am a huge fan of kimchi stew and I've had it enough to recognize the do's and don'ts. Do's: put lots of fresh kimchi and pork. Do put in rice cakes. Don't overcook the kimchi until it's mushy. Well my stew had very soft kimchi although most were not yet mushy- they were getting there. Even so without the rice cakes, the portion was pretty good and I would return! Service was solid.  Washrooms are upstairs. They 'don't' have wifi but I see a wifi: OWL NORTH and tip: the wifi password isn't their phone number, Minerva, or 'pls.'"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Even tho the services always so so, but we do love the pork soup, been there for years. But today was our last time. We r 4 ppl, ordered 4 pork soup. My two kids only like the cucumber side dish, they don't eat the other two kinds if side dishes. After we ask the server to gave us more cucumber dish, he said the side dishes r limited, refused give us more. I do have Korean friends, they always tell me, if u order the side dishes, that means u love their taste. They will more happier to give u more. But not the case in this restaurant. My husband and I already lost appetite, so we stopped eating. But my kids were still eating. The freaking server just put the bill on the table! I was so mad! Never go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hrs which is awesome as there's not too many late night restaurants in mississauga. Although I have not visited the other owls, I have gone to many other different Korean restaurants and this place is my personal favourite for Korean cuisine. I've seen some reviews saying the food is too expensive but many of the meals are $10 or below and can still fill you up, and that's a pretty good deal. I recommend the pork bone soup which is delicious and only 7.99. And if you go in the summer time, the spicy cold noodles are also very good! Only drawbacks I find is that it can get REALLY busy sometimes and they can be understaffed so it may take a while to get your order in and your food but nothing ridiculous. You can really tell they are trying to accommodate everyone as quickly as possible. Also, there are only 3 side dishes which is a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Whenever we passed by, this place is always packed. We ordered pork bone soup, spicy squid and japchae (noodle). I enjoy the pork bone soup as it was nice and hot. The meat felt off the bone and soup is just right (I wasn't as thirsty as I usually get when I drink soup with msg in it). The spicy squid was alright... If you like spicy, I wouldn't recommend it as the looks isn't spicy as it taste like, rather sweet. As for the Korean noodle, it was at our taste! The side dishes which came with the meal wasn't as good as other Korean places... They should marinate a little longer.   I will go back again... Maybe when other restaurants are closed. And I wouldn't wait in line to dine at this place."}
{"text":"I can't say they have the best pork bone soup- though that is what they are known for BUT I LOVE their Kimchi Chigae and ONLY their big portion version!  The two people serving of Kimchi Chigae offers more: dumplings, pork belly, rice cake, and some veggies. w/ two bowls of rice.  It it served in a large pot on a gas stove, which keeps cooking so as you eat the flavors continue to come out. There is actually a huge difference in taste compared to the single portion. Give it a try! I make it at home occasionally, but it really is delicious here.  Every week or every other week my bff and I will make it a mission to come share the big pot together. We are always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Excellent side dishes, and really good portion sizes. The prices are fair and they have quite a large menu. There aren't too many vegetarian options, so I recommend this place only to meat eaters. They also have combo options and can sit large groups. We ordered beef bulgogi which I was told was very good. I ordered japchae which was a bit on the oily side but packed full of vegetables. The fried dumplings were okay, but not the best compared to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Sometimes I work in the area and usually visit after the lunchtime rush, but before the dinner rush. Usually no lineup and the food tastes good.   Yesterday was a little bit different. Went with my brother and two kids. The food wasn't as impressive. My order of the pork bone soup was fantastic, but my brother's tofu soup wasn't as good. There was a thick layer of spicy oil right on top, and the tofu didn't taste fresh. Also tasted like there was sand in the soup. We assume that the oyster/mussel wasn't cleaned enough, but that is a guess. I will still  go back, but my brother not so much.   Pro  Tofu soup was bubbling hot Pork bone soup was up to par  Con  Tofu wasn't too fresh Seafood in the tofu had some sand in it. We assume it was from the oyster as it may not have been cleaned properly"}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed this location of Owl. Although it was busy and there were probably 5 or 6 parties ahead of us, we were seated in about 10-15 minutes on a Saturday night.  Generally, the safe option is their pork bone soup (#1 On the menu, $10.99). The pork bone soup is always flavourful and the pork bone is soft and tender.  I also really like their spicy Bulgogi ($14.99 + tax). The dish comes out on a sizzling plate and it's a mix of beef, glass noodles, veggies and a few slices of rice cakes. It's slightly saucy and mildly spicy. There is the hint of sweetness you would normally get with a regular bulgogi. It's one of my favourite dishes!  Both these dishes comes with a bowl of rice and you can choose to upgrade to multigrain rice.  The free appetizers are usually the same 4: bean sprouts, kimchi, spicy cucumber, and radish.  Overall, this location of Owl is consistent and the workers are quick to turnover a table, so no need to fret if you see a group of people hovering around the door."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the girls. Food is good but service is horrible..witnessed another lady walking out frustrated af 'cause they weren't helping her. Sighhhh again"}
{"text":"Had the Kam Ja Tang (pork bone soup), and wouldn't order it from here again. Meat was pretty good but broth was way too salty. By the end of my meal, all I could taste was salt. Sides were just ok as well (potato, bean sprouts, kimchi, radish, and pork skin).   Besides the food - service and atmosphere was good. Open 24 hrs which is a plus. However, there are so many options in koreatown that are so much better."}
{"text":"Our experience is very good. Staff is nice, joint is a bit tight but clean, we enjoyed the food we ordered. Will likely come back to try other foods."}
{"text":"It's not amazing food, but it's good for late night quick munchies.  If you want something comforting and tasty, this is the place to get Pork bone soup. I don't know what it is, but every time I get the pork bone soup here, I instantly get addicted all over again! The soup is not to spicy but full of flavour. The pork is soft and tasty. This is pretty much the food to get here. I haven't really ventured out to other food items on the menu.  Service is okay. The place is always packed so service is quick. Don't expect the service to drop by your table every now and then.  Portions and price are good for what you're getting. The pork bone soup is a good size for one person and can easily fill you and for under 10 dollars, you can't go wrong with that.    The only thing I would want to see more of are more varieties of side dishes. I've been to other korean restaurants and they have more and better side dishes to offer."}
{"text":"I always come here, this is my go to place for a late-night of Korean craving.   For 8-15 dollars you get...  FOOD: the food here is delicious. It's a quick, readily prepared and well seasoned. I've been to korea before and trust me owl does a nice job of suiting both European and Korean taste buds. I appreciate the consistency of all their dishes, and their menu changes, I'm glad to see some of my favourites being added into the menu.  SERVICE: The service is fine, they're willing to suit your needs and get you more apps if you ask. ofc this is a fast pased restaurant so they aren't going to stand and talk for too long.   ATMOSPHERE: really average, no added style just looks like an average restaurant. I mean got the price you pay don't expect to be dining in some 5 star restaurant. it's meant to be fast east and cheap."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always good. However, service has declined over the years. There used to be a server that worked there with orangey-red hair and he was always on top of all his orders.  He no longer works there and ever since then I've noticed the new workers are slacking.   Today, I ordered take-out for the first time and waited 20 minutes and it wasn't even busy at all. There were two other tables that came AFTER me and they got served their food before me. I asked the server where my order went and he looked like he forgot to check the back to see if it was ready...  I finally got my food 20 minutes later!! Not only that, another server kept telling the customers to shut the door because it was cold.  Ummm last time I checked this was supposed to be your job. Plus, the restaurant is super tiny it's not like they have to go out of their way to close it themselves. Before I left the restaurant, I saw a lady come in and the server goes \"shut the door\" and she goes \"excuse me? Shut the door?\", the server then said \"you're cold aren't you? So close it\".   Talk about rude.   Again, no complaints about the food...but there has to be something done about customer service."}
{"text":"Owl used to be my go to place for some late night Korean after a heavy night of drinking, when I was younger of course, now, however, I've come to appreciate this place during the day. Not sure why this place is so heavily criticized by some, the flavours of all the food that I've tried have been terrific. Pork bone soup is well seasoned with hefty amounts of meat on the bones, served with equally satisfying amount of potatoes and you don't have to pay 2$ for a side of rice like some places make you do, all that for only 10$ is a steal. Soon dae (blood sausage) was probably the best I've had that wasn't home made, wasn't over salted and doesn't have a jelly consistency on the inside, the rice that's stuffed inside with the meat hasn't become too soft, meaning the dish is relatively fresh. I could go on about each of the dishes but this review would be far too long, in short, The quality of the food at this location is very good. Where they fail, at times, is in the service. When they're busy a lot of tables seem to be overlooked, but thankfully they have a big red button that you can push to get a waitress/waiter to help you out."}
{"text":"The side dishes are ALWAYS fresh, that's enough for me to keep coming back.  Can't go wrong, the value is hard to beat for fresh veg with a flavourful entrée.  Friendly and fast service.  Oh ya, open 24/7, thank you Owl!!"}
{"text":"Just went back last night around 9:10pm. The place was bustling as usual. We were seated within a minute of arriving and served hot tea.   Food: I got the seafood tofu soup (soon du bu) and my friend got the spicy pork stir fry. We also got the deep fried Mandu which wasn't as good as last time and ended up making us both sick.   Let's start by saying we didn't get our ban chan till our food arrived. Generally this is served prior to the food coming but oh well - it was yummy.   My soup - was boiling hot, packed with seafood (oyster, clams, one mussel, one shrimp and lots of chopped squid. It wasn't overly spicy but the seafood flavour and the delicious silken tofu was immaculate. Next time I really want to try the multigrain rice.   My friend said the pork Bokeum was very good as he finished his entire plate on his own.   Those dumplings - those made us very bloated and sick. They were fried to a crisp which I loved however the filling fell abit flat and they were abit oily. The last time they were incredible and extremely juicy.   Overall - I would go back. I knocked one star cause of the Mandu and cause I got sick but the food is incredibly worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dinner. It has a cozy feel to it, although a pretty good size restaurant for ktown.   I ordered the beef bugolgi. It was strips of sirloin with mixed vegetables and rice cake pieces. Mostly all dishes come with a side of rice. The meal was good! Very hearty and filling. It's tasty, but not mindblowingly delicious, although I have absolutely no regrets.   I got to try my mom's pork bone soup and my sister's soft tofu soup with seafood. I didn't really like the pork bone soup. It was overly salty and had a bitter taste to it, I've had better. The soft tofu soup was yummy! Has a homemade authentic taste.   Service was alright, they were pretty friendly. Cash only, they have an atm in the restaurant. Would come again."}
{"text":"Enjoy their food a lot! This is a place we frequent. It's the easy choice; great food and friendly staff (with a few exceptions here and there). They do tend to get quite busy especially in the evenings. I notice their food changes from time to time but hasn't been deemed as terrible by any means. One of the better owls in their chain and it's a plus that it's opened 24hrs. Recommendations include kamja tang, kampung gi, beef soups, and noodle soup. Comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"I prefer Ka Chi over this place. The pork bone soup is not as good here. Not bad but not that good.   The place is kinda small and little run down. For some reason there is always a line up. If you are hungry I wouldn't go to this place. There are plenty of Korean restaurant around this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Owl is always busy, and it seems like there isn't enough servers despite how busy the place is. I don't usually come here, and I was craving bibimbap. Bibimbap here was not bad, comes in a standard stone bowl which in my opinion will fill you up. Don't expect to have top notch service, they don't exist here. Prices are a tiny bit overpriced. But it's 24/7 so perfect for those that want a late night meal."}
{"text":"Love the food here!   The setting is more of a diner than a restaurant but no big deal. Great food and customer service. The wait time is AMAZING. We ordered deep fried dumplings, spicy fried squid, BBQ Ribs, and deep fried dumplings and waited no more than ten minutes. Love the fact that each dish comes with rice and you don't have to pay extra like other places.  We also got some well made cabbage and cucumber that comes with every dish.  The only thing I found strange was when we asked for our take out trays they said we couldn't take the cabbage home cause it was sold from there. What? LMAO. It's my food! I ordered it. I can take it if I want. That was weird so it got 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out from this restaurant for almost a year and have always ordered the same couple meals. There has been constant issues with this place as they've forgotten to put in side dishes or the rice in the takeout bag and sometimes the pork meat tasted really tough.  But I still contined to come as I did like their dishes.  However, the way they dealt with today's problem made me decide to stop supporting this place. I had ordered the spicy pork for take out and the order was confirmed by the lady on the phone. When I get there after driving 20 minutes, I'm told by the male waiter that the menu item was removed and the lady made a mistake.  I understand that these things happen but the thing that pissed me off was that it seemed like no takeout receipt was placed for it so they must have realized there was a mistake soon after my call but decided not to bother to call me back and let me know that. In addition, there was no apology. The guy just told me I have an outdated menu (even though the menu item is still on their website) and then left me at the counter so he could go back to the kitchen. So in addition to your staff not knowing their own menu, they have bad attitudes too. Great."}
{"text":"This is another spot that I really enjoy going whenever I crave for those sinful midnight food...I know it should be just a snack because it's after midnight already.. but.. I know that I wouldn't be able to sleep anyway  if I'm not going to give my tummy of what  it's craving for so.. diet can wait when  I'm ready... yeah right!...:)   My favorite dish to order here is bulgogi..  It never let me down. Ive tried other dishes as well..only a few  might make me want to order them again... bibimbap, hmm I'm not that impressed.pork bones soup is ok..  Kalbi  on the other hand is good.. i love love love the smell of it especially when they serve it on a hot plate with all those smoke coming out, that i know is not from the meat but from the sauce that they put as a final touch before it goes out of the kitchen....jeezz..... it makes me smile all t time...it makes me so happy.. you know how some scents affects your emotions.. like.. it can make you smile when something  smells  good or you'll automatically frown when you smell something awful.... anyway,..Food  here is good.. price is good..they're  open 24  hours.. plus you can have some soju if you're lucky :)  they are fast and friendly.. so...those of you who have not tried it yet.. what are you waiting for??? Oh..BTW. . The place is a little bit rundown.. nothing special.. but they try to maintain  the cleanliness.. and they are always nice..and  for that 2 thumbs  up!"}
{"text":"Gamjatang rules like everyone said, the pork was really tender and the stock had a hearty, meaty taste, not just spicy water. Bulgogi was alright, especially the quality of the beef, just served on a normal ceramic plate though. Came with mandu. Banchan not too out there - kimchi, namul, bean sprouts, and chili potato. My date had their japchae, which he liked, but I didn't try here. Service was warm. Bill came out to 25.40, so definitely a good place for students!"}
{"text":"I rarely have Korean food and when I do, it's usually Korean food at those Japanese-Korean sushi fusion places.    I tried the Pork Bone Soup, which I found very flavourful and lots of fall-off-the-bone meat.  It was excellent and for $7.99, still a decent price. If I had this alone, I would give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the bimibap wasn't the greatest. The egg was over-cooked, so it didn't ooze yolk like it should and had limited meat.  So this dish brought it down.  Overall, I would try it again though."}
{"text":"We all have certain boundaries when it comes to trying different types of foods.  I have very few.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone says they dont like something yet they have never tried it.  I will give everything a chance then decide weather I like it or not.  One of my friends has been ranting and raving about this bulgogi thing.  Well for months I thought this was the name of the restaurant.  I come to find out its the name of a dish.  After months of hearing about it my buddy took me for the first time.  I didn't know what to expect.  When entering into the plaza I thought I was in China.  Felt like I was in a totally different world.  As we are parking I ask where is this place.  He points to this restaurant tucked in the corner of the plaza.  There it is.  At last my first experience at Owl of Minerva to try this bulgogi.  We were served quickly, order was taken and food was brought to our table in less than 10 minutes.  Now about the bulgogi.  When the plate was in front of me I can smell the goodness of all the spices.  The meat was super tender and the dish was bursting in flavor.  The end of the dish was soon to come and I found myself wanting to lick the plate for how tasty everything was.  I will be back to Owl of Minerva and here is the better part its open 24 hours.  You may find me there randomly in the middle of the night LOL."}
{"text":"My Korean buddy brought me here one night because I told him I wanted to try some Korean-style soup. I got Pork Bone Soup which is their famous menu. The dish was okay. I liked how the pork was soft but it was so hard to eat because of the bones. The place did seem a little unhygienic for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for the kamjatang (pork bone soup) which is my personal favorite Korean dish. Although i was starving it still tasted mediocre. The broth was salty with not much other dimension to it. The pork bone was decent, meat was tender. I've definitely had a lot better but you can't beat that cheap price.   Also got JeYukBokeum which is a stone plate with pork and vegetables and spicy sauce. This was decent but again, maybe because of the kamjatang, everything just started tasting salty. Ended up taking the JeYukBokeum home and remaking it for lunch the next day. Probably won't go back unless I really had no other choice."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable ramen it was delicious, open 24/7. Very wide variety of food and good prices!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great spot to hang out with friends for some late night food, but service seems to have gotten worse with time.   I went with my friends at 10:30pm on Thursday. It took over 30 minutes for the first dish to finally arrive. When we asked the waiter if we could get side dishes while we wait, he refused and told us that it would come with the dishes.   When the food did come, they did not ask us who the food was supposed to go to; they simply put it down on the side closest to them. For the third dish, my phone was on the table and the waitress tried to move my phone with the dish in an attempt to place the dish down.   Needless to say, I was not impressed with the service and will not be going back."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS experience here.  We were in a cab around midnight after days of working a convention and many nights of hitting events/parties - and very hungry.  The cab driver randomly dropped us off on the street with a bunch of Korean restaurants - and this place had a glow that drew us in.  We took a chance and gave it a try.  - Hole in the wall - Cash only - Good food/menu - Has beer - Comfort food/good banchan  We had naengmyun (cold noodle), haemul pah jun (seafood pancake) and the duk bokki (spicy rice cakes).  All of it was delicious - I think my favorite was definitely the duk bokki.  Would definitely return next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love how it's 24hrs even open on all holidays. I go for Item#1 The Neck Bone with potato soup. So filling all the time. Love the short ribs too. Pretty cramped so be prepared to share a table with other people. Weekends there are line ups so be ready."}
{"text":"Is it the best Korean food you can get? No. Is it incredibly comfortable seating? No. However owl is always there for you, anytime of day, literally every day of the year. And it is a genuinely good restaurant, given the context it is absolutely amazing. The service is fast, the food is delicious, is consistently good and freshly prepared, and the space is cozy. When looked at it in the correct context, one of the only 24 hour places in mississauga, owl is literally perfect in every way"}
{"text":"Some decent korean food, ordered the pork bone soup (gamjatang) and bulgogi and the only problem that I had was the fact that the soup consisted of many small bones in the soup and not much meat. In terms of the atmosphere, it wasn't the cleanest place but it was enough to make you feel comfortable. The staff is friendly and very nice, as when I asked for extra side dishes several times they were happy to give me more unlike other places I have been too where they begin to get annoyed. Very good prices and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I used to love going to the Owl. I am caucasian and have been going here since 2010 and tonight I just went with my boyfriend, and this is the last time I will ever go there!!!  I experienced a night that topped the last time I had been there when we were seated by an older lady and then yelled at by another that wanted to seat an Asian group before us instead. So we had to get out of our seats after being seated and relocate. That was last time, this is what happened tonight (2 weeks later)...  The new waiting staff is SO RACIST!!!!!   My boyfriend and I asked for a side of rice and soy sauce and a Budweiser. I was so tired from working today that I forgot how late it was (past 1:30 and that restaurants stop serving alcohol after 2), and the older lady with the short hair and plastic surgery that has served us before and seated other people before us, pretended not to understand our order and refuse to serve us certain items, asked us what we would like. My boyfriend ordered the beer and 2 side orders of rice with soy sauce, since I wasn't hungry and he doesn't have a big appetite.  The lady instantly refused. She told us she couldn't do it, so she got the younger guy, with glasses, about 6'3 (new management waiting staff) and I had seen him before, he has given me very racist service as well and very judgemental to me and my Dad in the past. The minute he walked up, he barely greeted me, and we placed our order. He then said,   \"No, we cannot take your order. Please leave, we are not a bar, we are a restaurant, its 2 am. Please just leave.\"  I completely understand that it was past the time. I was too tired to realize what time it was, if he could have just told us that in a kinder way. But the way he \"assumed\" we were white trash looking for a \"past the hour drink\" and dismissing us to leave was remarkably rude and racist! We were just thirsty and walking around after work. The entire new waiting staff is extremely racist. The old waiting staff were so kind :( I miss them dearly. One of the ladies I used to see all the time at the night shift would comment on how nice my makeup was, the other young man working there would give my Dad and I extra side dishes when we needed more, and the old tall young man would joke about how us Canadians are so polite. What happened to the old staff? They were incredibly sweet. Everyone now working there has treated me and made me ashamed in my own skin.  My boyfriend and I left the restaurant immediately, I was so embarrassed by the way we were treated in front of him.   Shame on Owl of Minerva for hiring these people!!!!!!! We take the time to learn about your culture and treat you respectfully and politely, and with curiosity and an inquisitive mindset, but you come into my country and treat us Caucasians like complete trash!!!!!   SHAME ON YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hot Korean food open 24 hrs. I wish there was one nearer to my side if the GTA. I was starving at 12:30 a.m. when we walked in the door. This place is a godsend to late night owls.  I ordered gamjatang which already came with rice. The meat on the gamjatang was simply falling off the bones. For the price this place is definitely worth it!   Service was fast & easy, will definitely be back in the future for more!"}
{"text":"So where to begin.. I am a big fan of Owl of minerva.. my first choice was to go to the location in mississauga but unfortunately it was packed.. so my partner and I decided to go for a ride and go to the other locations that's 24hrs..  yes there only 2 locations that are 24hrs mississauga and North york.   So this is what I can say about this location.. nothing too bad but I do hope they improve it. They only have 4 sides, kimchi. Radish. Cucumber and seaweed  they were ok expect for the seaweed for some reason tasted weird but their kimchi was awesome stuff very spicy so that's a plus for me.  Service was ok they came to the table with chopsticks spoons scissor and cups and water right away they didn't give hot tea which I was shocked about especially last night was a cold night they gave icy water.. I can only say they lack on service is checking if their customers are òk not all tables have those special buttons to call for service so we had to ask the table next to us if we can borrow their button to get some service cause they didn't look in our direction which was next to the entrance.    WHAT WE ORDERED: YukGaeJang  ???? Beef with vegetables in hot spicy soup, rice   *hmmm not a fan of it this is what my boyfriend ordered I tried it I  was spicy which is good but for me had a odd taste like I was tasting soup of roots like it wasn't a earthy taste all I can say it was odd my boyfriend didn't really finish it so.   BulGoGi Busot JjiGae  ??????? Bulgogi and mushroom soup with sweet soy sauce    * and this is what I ordered this is my favorite dish so I was really expecting it to taste the same it didn't lack some flavor but still good I would say they didn't put enough of the sweet potato noodles compared to the other location but I did finish it..    Overall for two people the bill came us to $30 for 2 dishes and I gave a $4 tip even though  think they deserve a lil less cause of their service but I don't want to be chased down for a tip cause it has happened to me before in that area so didn't want to risk it. Would I go back not sure lost likely I'll go to the mississauga location I rather be loyal there"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Seriously...  I also feel like the pork bone soup isn't as good as it was before. It just seems like the place is only popular because of its 24/7 standing.   It isn't worth It. There are so much more better Korean options around Mississauga."}
{"text":"Try the Tofu Soup it is delcicious, also the Kalbi is very good."}
{"text":"We frequent this place during the winter months for kamjatang (pork bone soup).  We love it and is consistently good. There is a new bbq pork chop we discovered today and the meat was so tender and delicious! Came with a bowl of steamed rice. Only down side for me is I wish that the onions and bean sprouts underneath the pork chop had cooked down more on the sizzling plate.  Bibimbop was good. Shrimp fried rice tasted good but quite oily."}
{"text":"One of my favourite late night stops on the way home from a long night out. Always lively, loud, and the food fresh. The menu is not very big, but no matter. Most people go for the pork bone soup, and can't get enough of it's flavour.   For the price you pay, it's well worth it. There's a reason why this franchise has become so popular recently."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in Toronto.  The mixture of flavors make for spectacular dishes!  The shared items are worth getting if you're in a group of 3 or more. You can get a good deal on beer and it is relatively inexpensive and definitely filling.  The staff was even kind enough to assist us when we ordered an item that nobody knew how to cook!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this restaurant and I specifically came for the Pork Bone soup.   It was exactly what I expected; delicious and filling.  Couldn't have asked for anything better.    My boyfriend ordered the spicy seafood soup and found it too spicy but this being his first time, I'm not sure he knew what he was getting himself into and should've requested it to be less spicy.  I on the other hand didn't mind it since I love anything/everything spicy =)  Aside from the soups, the menu has quite a few things to offer but alot of it would suit a certain palatte in which I do not have.  Of course I wouldn't mind trying any of the deep fried chicken dishes that are offered. I'm sure I shall when I visit again.    All in all a great restaurant if you know what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I could just eat pork bone soup everyday of the week if I lived close by...  This is by far my favourite location of the two:  - ample parking out back - open 24 hours - larger seating area  - detailed menu with photos     I hadn't realized there was a second location (as I had been always visiting the one near Christie and Bloor) until a friend had informed me otherwise.    It's crazy how I had driven by so many times 20th out this knowledge to stop by.    As you have already read.. I always get pork bone soup.  Tried been bone once by accident and it could not compare.     Last time I visited, we decided to try the egg roll.  Legit it was an egg patty rolled up.  To me, it looked like it very much resembled an omelet that was rolled up.  It had different flavours that wwre unfamiliar, which was nice.    I also learned that I have liked kimchi all along."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Wicked kimchi, pork belly you cook table side, jap chae is BOMB and my favorite-Korean short ribs- one of the best in the city. Sometimes slow service and super packed. They are open late"}
{"text":"Went here because my girlfriend was craving for pork bone soup on a cold rainy day. We sat and gave our order in the first 5 mins.  Then we waited, we saw 3 tables sat down after us and get their food.  That is when we asked about our order. Turns out the server did not punch it in and forgot. No one even bothered or cared that we were sitting there for a long time. We promptly got up and left.  Food: would not know Service: very poor Price: did not pay Return: no"}
{"text":"I dislike owl of minerva. I was dragged here against my will after a night downtown... my friends and I staggered into this shop (not drunk, just dead tired). The restaurant is dingy and dimly lit, with dirty looking linoleum and crusty looking chairs. It's way past it's time. Signs on the wall read \"No separate bills. One table one bill\" um, a little inconvenient but that's okay I guess..   The food at owl is kind of overpriced, a dollar or two above average from other korean places.. $6.99 for a bowl of 'ramen' aka instant noodles with the powder mix from H-mart across the street? No thanks. (My friend caved in and got this though) Bi Bam Bap was $10.99 and I didn't realize how much of a rip off that was until I went to another korean restaurant today and got a similar portion of bi bam bap for $7. The side dishes are sad and it's only pickled cucumber, kimchi and some other hard thing.. carrot? The meal was unsatisfying and I couldn't finish the food. Slightly lost my appetite after it came. I can't complain about the service too much. There are waiter bells and they came immediately every time after I pushed it, which you don't see a lot after it's past 2am.  The crowd here is really divided, a lot of quiet koreans that live in the area and then there's the loud douchey arrogant fatasses that think they have the right to yell across the restaurant and be rude to everybody else eating. It got so annoying to the point where my friend said \"is it ok if I take my pot and eat it outside?\"   Don't think I'll be coming back here, ever. Or any other owl."}
{"text":"I've been to the Owl many different times and location. I am a fan of their service because they make my friends and I feel special every time we go, even though they probably do that for everyone. Favorite one is by Young/Finch, they have a free parking lot behind it, open late and is not badly prices.  Their portions are great and the traditional Korean side dishes are really yummy, which they refill when I quickly finish some lol  Of course i order my \"GamJaTang\", table cooking style and it was a good portion and yummy! They gave us a free appetizer of mushrooms and vegetables! They also have purple rice =D They also had a beer deal which was great 4 for $10 or something.   They beef ribs are meaty and yummy and rice cakes are a good deal.  Apparently Korean will be the new Thai, if so I hope Owl opens a few more in the West end (BRAMPTON) lol where there is no korean restaurants :("}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I went around 5AM with one of my friends who decided he was just as hungry as I was. Finding this place was just a tad bit hard as we were not from the area, but once we did find it, we were amazed. Walking in, the restaurant felt a little lousy, but the best part about it is we were seated promptly and were given our own pitcher of water to serve ourselves. Checkmate! I don't remember what I ordered but boy was it delicious! The flavors in the bites of chicken were definitely spicy but I did ask for a ton of spice! My friend ordered one of their well known breakfast items and actually had trouble finishing it because he was full! Overall, this place is a really nice 24 hour restaurant hidden in the nooks and crannies of Mississauga. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always love going to Owl of Minerva for good Korean food. Ordered the Kimichi Fried Rice and it came out relatively quickly. Service was good and the food was pretty good. It's always a great place for getting relatively cheap Korean food in a nice place."}
{"text":"24 hour Korean food - the only one in Mississauga, as far as I know. It's very popular, but you shouldn't have trouble finding seating, regardless of when you go.   Most people order the gamjatang (pork bone soup), or the bulgogi (grilled marinated beef). I've also had the spicy ricecake and the khampunggi (hot and sour deep fried chicken). Owl is very consistent with the quality of their dishes, and I would be confident ordering anything from their menu, which is comprised of around 50 dishes.   When ordering, consider what type of dish you are ordering. Some of them are meals that come with rice, and some of them are dishes that are meant to be shared.    The service at Owl is quick and consistent. Upon being seated, you'll be given water or hot/cold tea, and after taking your order, they will bring you a series of appetizers - kimchi radish, kimchi, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. These will keep you occupied as your dishes are made.   My recommendation is to definitely try the staple dishes I mentioned above, but don't be afraid to venture out into the other offerings (and try the kham pung gi, it's transcendent).  --- Cash Only under $20"}
{"text":"This place is hard to find.  Of course, I didn't have the address.  My friend just told me that they are on Yonge and Finch.  The pork bone stew was okay.  Not great.  However, I was looking thru the whole bowl and can't find any damn potatoes.  Isn't this suppose to be pork bone and potato stew?  Also, only kimchee as the side dish.  I know they only charge $6 for the bowl of stew, but I expected a little more side dish.  How about adding some bean sprouts."}
{"text":"Solid Korean food in a cozy setting. Tried the Gamjatang hotpot and flavours were good, but could be more tasty. Very good value in terms of prices!"}
{"text":"We ate gamjatang and suedaebak soups. It was filling. But the suedaebak did not have enough meat.   The side dishes were ok but they did not have seaweed.   Overall it was not bad."}
{"text":"Food is good but not excellent. Often very busy at lunch times and especially on the weekends.  Please carpool if you plan on showing up with a crowd, seating is limited and so is parking.   Bring a jacket if you are here during the winter, there is almost no insulation at this establishment.   I've always liked Owl's service, they're fast enough to keep up with the pace as it always does fluctuate uncontrollably at peeks."}
{"text":"Excellent service provided by Jayo when we went there on Sunday night. Very friendly and cheerful guy. It looked like he was having a good time doing his job and it added to the positive vibe of the place. When we told him that we didn't wanna have the kimchi side dish, he offered to replace it with any other appetizer we like. No one's ever offered that before eventhough we always refuse the kimchi everytime we go there. Love their Bulgogi and L.A. Kalbi but their Pork Bone Soup is the real winner. Gotta say it's the best we've had in the GTA that's why we keep coming back. Only reason why I don't give this place 5 stars is because it needs to be renovated. It's outdated, too cramped and always cold (winter or summer)."}
{"text":"This is a quality Korean joint, next to Buk Chang Dong Soon  How is this place listed as \"Owl of Minerva\"? A bit misleading.  Sure, the signage is in Korean but how does referencing an owl let you find this place. Look for the \"E-Mart\" sign and the two \"booungee\" signs, right above it, 2nd floor, you're there. If Buk Chang Dong is full and the crowds come here.  Some places are just about one thing - here it is the pork-bone soup.  Huge portions, fall of the bone, spicy and tasty. Great in winter. A must try and likely one of the best dishes that really put Toronto on the map for it varied ethnic cuisine.  Otherwise, the rest of the menu is solid Korean fare. The bibimbap is solid and flavourful and a few other soup dishes were deliciously heart-warming. Let me repeat though, pork-bone soup!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we've ever gone with our newborn when he was only 5days old.  They have always been friendly, accommodating and helpful and especially with my little guy who is now 2.5yrs old.  I'm not sure why the bad reviews on service.  They were always quick and the food has always been consistent.  I think we've only been here a handful of times when it wasn't packed.  Meaning, be prepared to wait or go before the rush.  The pork bone soup is the best.  I'm not an expert but I've had a few from different places and I've found their's to be most flavourful.  The spicy rice cake is also great.  The large Kalbi could be a bit bigger portion, especially for $24.99.  Although, it is quite tasty.  The cutlets, bulgogi and japchae are standard from most Korean restaurants we've been to.  The dumplings, I have to say, are pretty bad.  Also not a fan of spicy pork bbq, a bit too fatty of a cut."}
{"text":"We ordered beef deep fried dumplings, spicy seafood soup, hot, sweet and sour chicken there. They were great and we enjoyed our meal very much."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was so delicious, a must buy if you come here. The kimchi jiggae was okay... This is a really good restaurant to try!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Overall experience was an epic fail, from their un welcoming staff, there's this old lady that was very rude, she did even bother to greet, their place is a mess, it stinks and their food is over priced compare to other korean restaurants thats clean, cozy and accomodating..   This place is not recommendable.."}
{"text":"The place didn't look very clean or inviting. Water glass had marks and had to be returned. Service was ok, but they don't allow splitting the bill and no credit card below $20 i believe.  Shady practices in general; We had the spicy squid and fried chicken, none of it was bad but wasn't great enough for us to ignore the other things i mentioned."}
{"text":"Now this is a cute little gem I've been meaning to try. Korean food is awesome! So when I walked in to this little place tucked away in an obscure plaza, to find a huge line up, I was pleasantly surprised. How have I missed this quaint little restaurant.   My friend had the bimbim bap (hope I spelled that right lol) and I had in house made noodle soup which was delicious. The staff was attentive and friendly and the food was great! Complimentary and unlimited corn tea, kimchi as well as spicy pickled cucumbers, bean sprouts and radishes were awesome! The best part? The prices! Super cheap and fairly decent portions.   I highly recommend you give this place a try if you're in the area.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I found it very cramped and there was no place to wait for your table, everyone is kind of just jammed in the doorway with only 2 chairs for waiting. So in winter I'd imagine that would be a deciding factor for me, if I would go there. No one wants to wait pushed up against someone else or worse outside in the cold. Overall! Don't miss this place, if you can get a table fairly quickly, give it a try!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I ate with my friend and I remember getting bibimbap with some side dishes. The food is really good and comforting and the staff is really nice as well. I had good experiences with all of their branches I visited and I recommend coming here if you want a good korean food fix way late at night or whenever you want if your in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Always busy, food is delicious portions are great. I only order the pork bone soup, why mess with a good thing. Actually I have cravings for it from time to time. Not a huge fan of the tea, I ask for water to quench the spice of the kimchi."}
{"text":"I love this place. Could use a bigger seating area, but it works.  I wish there was more parking."}
{"text":"Cheap prices, great food, open late, I actually don't mind this place (I'm stuck between a 3 or a 4 star).  With mini Korea Town (Yonge and Finch area) being filled with Korean restaurants, this place is actually pretty cool.  Definitely not a fancy place but if you're coming back after a night of clubbing or are just really hungry and want to have a drink you can get it here. Their stew is really good and watch out for their chicken feet, SUPER SPICY (it'll be a good challenge to see how many you can have). They have combo's for $20 that include food and 5 beers or a bottle of Soju which isn't a bad deal.   The waiters are nice but the place gets packed late at night so be ready to wait a bit sometimes. All in all a decent place with decent food but nothing special."}
{"text":"The bibimbap picture was a lot better than what was served, almost zero beef, had better at least 6 other places in Korea town. Would never return, was tough on the stomach, gross. Nice sign though, i like owls."}
{"text":"I love going to Owl of Minerva on cold days. Owl is known for their pork bone soup which comes with a side of steam rice. I find that this is the best location out of all the owls in the GTA. I tried at other locations and find that this one has most flavor in their dishes and always have fast service.   Pros : - Fast service   Cons: - Rather small restaurant, limited seating  - There is very limited parking. They have a small private lot at the back but it is shared with other neighboring stores. There is street parking but you would have to pay."}
{"text":"As a chained restaurant, I am impressed by the consistency of customer service and food taste. I wouldn't say this place serves the best Korean food. However, based on its scale and the location, this is a go-to Korean restaurant in town.   This time I ordered the Chicken Dupbap and my partner had the BoSsam. My dish is a bit spicy and sweet. It comes with a fried egg, stir mixed vegetable with chicken and rice. The BoSsam comes with cooked pork slices, lettuces (using to wrap the meat), garlics, green peppers and special sauces. I had chance to wrap my preferred ingredients with the pork meat.   We were so full after barely finishing both dishes. The servers were friendly and came to refill the tea for us without even requesting.  Please keep the good service and the tasty food!"}
{"text":"Definitely an amazing late night eat. There's one close to my crib at Finch so I'll be popping by there in the near future.  I didn't try their famous pork bone soup but i did try the following:  - Korean Spicy Rice Cake (Duk Boki) - so saucy. I don't like this stuff, i just don't like the rice cakes. They're chewy and the sauce they come with is too sweet for my taste. Sometimes too much sausss is not the best thing?  - JAPCHAE NOODLES!! with beef. Ommggggg the thing that Nak Won is lacking, just a Japchae dish, nothing on the side. It was amazing, I can eat this stuff until I literally collapse and die.   - Banchan were meh, the potatoes were small, and there were only 5 of them. Kimchi was pretty standard and they had another type of kimchi-like raddish, larger pieces, fermented in what looks like the same kimchi sauce.   - Deep fried dumplings were amazing too, there were 10 or so and they're big and juicy and crispy and just friggin delicious.  I will definitely come back here - it's cheap and it's yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup disappointed me a little. Food is a bit pricy, I've had better Pork bone soup in Christie Toronto with lower price and tasted so much better."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and at all hours of the day. Considering Korean and Japanese food is either hit or miss in Canada I have to say that this restaurant is a step above most other places.  Though it says Japanese cuisine it's primarily a Korean joint. Which is fine because all the food tastes great. Nothing beats a good soup for breakfast. Anyway if your looking to get your Korean on the Minerva is the best place for that at all hours of the day."}
{"text":"Owl of Minerva is one of, if not the best place for Korean food in the GTA. Everything I've had from them has been above and beyond expectations and has been worth the price (although it has great prices). I'd highly recommend the bibimbap and bokeum ramen."}
{"text":"I went to this place a while ago, and all I see was the whole staff just sitting there taking about 1/3 of the restaurant eating.   We had the tteopokki (spicy rice cake). And even though, I never really tried it before, I didn't like it. I might come back here later on just to try some more of their other food.  Their side dishes were okay. nothing too great to talk about. It was just cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi and beansprouts. But, the cabbage kimchi had a slight weird after taste."}
{"text":"This place is opened 24 hours, which is great if you're craving for Korean food even in the the oddest hour. There's parking at the back of the restaurant but if you go at night, there's barely any light there, so because as people are walking around in the back as well as pot holes.  The parking lot leads to 2 different Korean restaurants, make sure you enter the yellow sign , it does get a little confusing.   Service is minimal, basically give you what you need, the menu and water when you sit, chopsticks and bowls after you order. They don't check up on you or interact anyhow.   Prices have gone up slowly since a few years ago, so certain things are still worth eating but certain are considered over priced. They also cut down on the amount of side dishes they offer now and I don't believe you can ask for refills anymore.   The consistency and quality of the soups still tastes the same.  This is my only choice if I'm hungry at night but don't want fast food as an option."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to their infamous pork bone soup on a cold night (early morning?) shortly after an evening at the club. Of course not this location but their very first one at Yonge and Finch area. This stuff was addictive. Hot soups, cold nights, cheap bills; you can't really ask for more. This was probably one of the new addictions at that time, kind of like having your first slice of pizza ever!  Years have past and imitators, innovators and copycats of this stuff are in abundance. They have since expanded their menu significantly in order to stay relevant and with that prices have also gone up significantly. There are many Korean restaurant staples; soups, soups, rice and various meats slathered in spicy, greasy sauce; delicious stuff.  This is probably one of the first pioneers of Korean cuisine in Toronto. They really have done a commendable job of ushering in all the quality Korean restaurants we are seeing today. Unfortunately, they have also fallen behind in the process.  All in all, I wouldn't necessarily avoid this place nor would I recommend it. It's kind of like McDonald's... It's not great but somedays you just want to eat it. Make no mistake about it, this is late night drunk food at it's finest unless of course you prefer hotdogs at 4am."}
{"text":"Ive had great experiences here. Servers were always nice, and food was always good. From the Porkbone soup, to bibimbap, etc. As a 24 hour location, its hard to complain."}
{"text":"I've been curious about the origin of their name. Not many owls or Minervas in Korea. But the wise dinner looking for good Korean food for a great price would fly to the Owl. Nothing new or remarkable on the menu. Just solid standards done right and for a good price. It fills up quickly mid-week by the dinner hour. Despite North York being one of Toronto 2-3 K-towns, I've found the Korean food up here generally shit compared to the more establish Bloor/Christie stretch. Owl is the odd duck here.  My lovely dining companion had a hankering for pork bone soup and she seemed to get a massive and tasty bowl. I ordered off menu (I feel like John Hamm in 30 Rock) the tteokbokki (aka ddeokbokki, dukboki, etc.). It's a simple mash of tubular rice cakes, fish cakes (odeng), onions, gochujang (red pepper sauce), and sugar.   Service is typically k-style. You're ignored until you flag down a server or ring a bell. THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RUDE SERVICE. It's just the way Koreans roll in restaurant culture. Look behind your table for the bell."}
{"text":"The food is okay. It's late night and the family there seems sweet, but I just didn't like the food all that much. I need a little more flavor, and it's a little pricy. Portions are giant though, so only get one dish per person."}
{"text":"ITS CASH ONLY  But it's so damn good, you may not care about the service fees for using the in-restaurant ATM machine (which I'm sure they get paid from)"}
{"text":"If you want korean food, i do highly recommend this place. I was glad thay they opened a branch in mississuaga because i usually go to the spadina location in toronto.    The food and service here are always 100%. Never lets me down. I come here during sundays with my parents after church.  Its pack during lunch time cause of the lunch rush hours. Sometimes you're lucky enough to get a seat right away.    The manager of the restaurant, or maybe i think its the owner always helps the other servers when they're busy.  Sometimes there are servers thay forgets to bring you side dishes that you ask for.  Usually its the younger girl servers that forgets. But then again its not a big of a deal.   I usually order the same food or sometimes i switch up. If you people have not tried their cucumber side dishes...you really need to hit up their restaurant.  I would probably just go to their restaurant and order a tun of the cucumber side dish; which you can for $5 and they give you a large tub.   The food price are reasonable. Like i said, who ever has not come to this restaurant; needs to come and visit. It would not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Looking for a savory Korean boiled broth with meat falling off the bone and relatively cheap? This is your place to go for Korean pork Bone soup. (Kam Ja Tang)   Although this franchise is less flavorful than the one downtown near Spadina and Dundas, it still hits the spot for authentic pork bone soup or kalbi which is grilled short beef ribs. There's a better Korean tofu soup in Mississauga (called Tofu House) than Owl if you're craving that, but otherwise this meal is hearty, warm, comes with cold side dishes that can be replenished for free, and abundant in food for the price you pay. Approx $10 per person+ tax and tip.   Sizzling short beef ribs that has a lingering aroma spread over a bed of Asian bean sprouts, coupled with a pork bone soup that's been marinated and stewed for hours on end, sided with refreshing cold side dishes.. What could go wrong? Feast away my friends."}
{"text":"If you were hungry in the middle of the night, they will serve you, they open 24 hours. Good Korean food, free side dishes, price is good, service is good. I like spicy pork bone soup, Kam Phung Gi (sweet and spicy chicken) and seafood udon with red sauce."}
{"text":"Came here late Friday night with some friends for pork bone soup ($9.29).  The restaurant was about 95% full and we were lucky to get a table right away.  The pork bone soup tasted similar to what you get at many other korean restaurants.  The bones I got had an average amount of meat on them but most of it was between the bones which made it difficult to get access to.   The side dishes were all good and they also refill the side dishes.  Also note that they only accepted cash.  Would probably visit this place again for future late night treats."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm starting to lose track how many times I've had their Pork Bone Soup. On any given day I am craving it! There has been a few times where the pork meat wasn't good but I continue to order again as the other times it makes up for it. There is so much meat to the bone, the broth, everything is delicious.  I've gotten a few friends hooked on this place as well."}
{"text":"I've been to other owl's ... and this location is by far the worst. Although their food is decent their service was horrible and it was really dark in there today - the only lights that were on were the ones on the wall which were pictures of their food...and I know they aint trying to set the mood and be all romantic lol. We had to try to flag them down multiple times to order. They would take orders from other tables who arrived after we did. We ordered kimchi fried rice and kalbi. The kimchi fried rice came out..and we starting munching on that....and we got through half of it...and called the server over ...and they totally forgot about our order of kalbi. They even forgot about the order from the table next to us as well. The button on the wall to call for service obviously doesn't work. The ladies serving look miserable and it's starting to show in their service."}
{"text":"This is the only 24 hour Korean restaurant, famous for their pork bone soup - I don't recommand anything else from here - it's pricier because of the convenience factor, not the taste. But their Pork Bone Soup is amaaaaazing!!!!  It's another \"boon shik\" (a fast food), which is a poplular style of restaurant  among working class and students, as we view eating out as a socializing ocassion not so much an event.  Their menu has changed a little bit since the last time I went - the pork bone soup used to be brought only with Kim Chi sides, but I see that they bring \"variety\" these days.  The soup is hearty, meat falls off the bone and even when you are very full, you are tempted to eat more of it because it's so good. Pork Bone Soup has been reviewed by papers as \"Korean chicken Noodle Soup\"  except this one has nutrients - I've used it as such and it  seem to work.  The service is slow and really, I've wanted to walk out so many times- but never did because the soup makes me come back sooner than later, especially during the winter months.  One thing I caution is that the soup is made spicy.  In fact, most stews in Korean cuisine are spicy - that's why you get rice and other things to neuturalize it. Don't eat all of the sides first ;tht is meant to be eaten with the rice and the stew - korean cuisine doens't come in structured order, like appetizer, entree, dessert. They usually come all at once. If you do eat it all though , they will bring you some more."}
{"text":"Came in here during a snow storm the other day. This place was still busy regardless of the weather. I ordered the pork bone soup as I do usually when I do come here. But did they add more things on their menu. I remember it being just 9 items. Now it's like pages of items to choose from. How about that pork bone soup? Why did they make items like potatoes an add on? I guess I do enjoy more meat but I wish they didn't change a thing. I must be getting old since I don't like the change ."}
{"text":"The Owl of Minerva is a Korean restaurant on Yonge Street, a little south of finch station. If you're driving, they have parking in the back.   From first glance, it's a very small tiny restaurant. One of my friend's and her fiancé brought me here, telling me this is amazing Korean food. I thought, why not?!  When you first walk in, it's very packed and squished together. This is also a 24 hour restaurant, so I'm guessing since we went around 11-midnight, it might've been one of their late peak times. Upon entering, the waiter already knew to get a pitcher of water to guess us started and appetizers came fairly quick, considering the amount of business they had.   I ordered a dish called \"Dolsot BiBimBap  ????\" (taken straight from their website). I'm usually used to burgers and fries, maybe some sushi but this was different for me. Nothing on the menu looked appetizing to me, not that I'm saying it wasn't delicious because it was AMAZING but it wasn't what I was used to.  They have a new \"house\" rule, one bill, no splitting, which we found was very odd but I paid the bill and it was a fair amount for the food we got. We thought it was pretty good.  I paid with my credit card and the lady accidentally hit \"okay\" for me, missing the tip section, I had no cash on me and they wouldn't swipe my credit card again to tip (because it costs to use my card), so I don't know how she expected me to tip. Tipping is optional but I eventually got a little cash from a friend and tipped.   They were pretty quick with service but it seems like they're always focused on something else. The TV plays only Korean TV but it'd be nice to have the news on both sides of the restaurant, for one person facing the west and one facing the east.  Other than that, it was a pretty average meal!  3/5"}
{"text":"It's nothing that I'd go out of my way for but as there are limited places that are open 24 hrs in Sauga, sometimes you gotta go where the drunk crowd goes.... It's in an Asian complex near Central Pkwy and burnhamthorpe in a non-descript area... Pork bone soup is decent, my go-to here is the fried dumplings ... Hard to go wrong with fried right? The servers are fairly efficient if not the friendliest.   So if you need a break from tremendous or get urge for Korean food at 5am... decent place to go"}
{"text":"A little overpriced for what you get. My gf and I aren't big eaters but an order or kalbi $14, bibimbap $8 and chapchae $8 cost us close to $40. will NOT be back unless the gf begs me to"}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant has the best pork bone soup. I have been going here since high school and the taste hasn't blemished one bit. Lived in Korea for a year and still the best I have tasted. And the icing to the cake, it is truly 24/7. If you don't want a big mac and, would like to enjoy a nice meal during your mid night cravings or munchies after long run at a bar/party. This is definitely the place to be.   Thank you for all the good years!"}
{"text":"I must admit: I am not a huge Korean food fan. Aside from the usual Korean instant noodles made by NongShim and perhaps the usual Korean BBQ, I usually do not eat any Korean Food. During a cold, freezing afternoon, after spending minutes deliberating on what to eat for lunch, my friend suggested Owl of Minerva, a authentic Korean restaurant located yonder at a local plaza. My friend insisted that I eat more Korean Food, I haplessly agreed.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted with a long line-up of folks with the same mutual hunger and thirst for Korean Food. The hostess took our number and assured us the wait will be worth our time. After several minutes of waiting while watching some nice individuals slurping down some nice noodles, a waitress took us to our table. She gave us two menus for a table of four. The tables were a bit crowed for us to move around. After getting settled into our table, I sat and deliberated on what Item I should order. I decided to play my cards safe and eat a Ramen. My friends also decided to order rice cakes as a side dish for everyone to share.  On the side, free of charge, was a traditional Korean tea. I must be honest: the tea was unbearably bitter. I ordered a glass of cold water instead, which proved to be boon since the food was spicy. More on that later.   After several minutes of waiting, our dishes came steaming hot. My mouth salivated at first sight of my amazing dish. My ramen was placed in a metal pot or some kind of contraption. My ramen was made with your typical NongShim noodles filled with a spicy broth mixed with mushrooms, ricecakes, onions, and dumplings, and topped of with an egg. Look at the picture for some visual aid.  I eagerly grabbed my chopsticks and picked up a handful of noodles with some mushrooms and rice cakes. I slurped down everything between my chopsticks and my mouth. The spiciness of the broth hit me instantaneously. My mouth burnt like molten lava burning through a building. I reached for my cup of water and chugged down the entire cup. 4/5 stars for the noodles and the mushrooms. Deducted 1 point off for the spiciness, but that's largely from my inability to handle spicy food. FYI: I finished to ramen, albeit in excruciating pain.   The texture of the rice cakes tasted a bit odd and off-putting. Not something I would eat again. However the broccoli in the dish tasted amazing. 2.5/5 stars for the broccoli, but deducted some grades off for the sweetness and rice cake itself.    Owl of Minerva served some delicious food with flavours of spiciness, sweetness and saltiness all in one bite. Although I was not fully satisfied with my meal, my friends, who are Korean Food fanatics enjoyed their lunch. With that being written and signed off, I myself am satisfied and content. 4/5 stars, for the reasons that the ramen was delicious, spare the spiciness level and the rice cakes. Full disclosure: many of my opinions of the restaurant are subjective personal tastes. Many of you folks who are Korean food lovers will disagree with me. But I'll let posterity be the ultimate judge."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Was craving a pork bone soup at the Owl of Minerva. Was it the Owl? I don't know.   But the kamjatang was insanely good.   Perfect combination of broth, meat and potato. Despite being photographically compatible, the taste was absolutely spot on. Huge portion of meat, soup broth was amazing.    All in all a great experience.   Tip: cash only."}
{"text":"Was my first time here. Not a big fan of ethnic chain restaurants. Would rather have a ma and pa cooking some amazingness in the kitchen. With that said, this place was great.   Got here at feeding time. The place was packed. Regardless, the service was spot on. Ordered the pork bone soup. It was dope. Lots of amazing flavours in the broth. Ample amount of meat and heat. It was really really fantastic.   I'd definitely go back here soon and try some other wonderful creations.   Sheesh - I need to stop eating out :s"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Pork Bone Soup at Owl of Minerva. It's rich with flavour and usually has lots of meat. The service is usually fast and efficient.  Tonight's experience was different from my past visits, and not in a good way. The servers were not very friendly. The food was not as hot as usual. The service was very slow. We had to push the call button several times before a server came over.  We came here, out of our way, becuase we wanted a good bowl of pork bone soup. We ordered four bowls. I was hoping to capture a picture of the steam rising from the bowl, as I had in the past. These bowls were not sizzling hot, like I'm used to from every Korean restaurant, or even like the bowls on the table next to us. Only one of the bowls had potato. I can forgive that because there was a generous amount of pork in each bowl.  The soup still tasted good. So did the side dishes. We never got the Kalbi that we ordered and we weren't going to wait around for it. It took a few more hits on the call button to get our bill. Good, they didn't charge for the kalbi. They totally forgot, even though our order was confirmed in the beginning. The service tonight was a big fail.  If you think I'm being too harsh, consider this - a couple sat at the table right next to us about five minutes after we arrived. They got their sizzling bowls of soup before we even had a chance to order. They were done and gone in no time. That's what we expected."}
{"text":"24 hours of pork bone soup goodness. I cannot complain."}
{"text":"They have real authentic Korean food, and it's REALLY cheap as well. Had the bi bim bap at the First Markham location - really delicious. The kamjatang at the Yonge and Finch location is AMAZING (and it's opened 24 hours too!) People there are amazingly nice as well!"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup is quite plain, not enough salt. Seafood tofu soup is really disappointing, not much seafood, too much tofu."}
{"text":"I love this place for Korean food! The small, tasty and complimentary appetizers are so good. My favourite is the potatoes in some sweet sauce.  The pork bone soup is filling, cheap and since Korean food is known to be spicy, this one is mild and great to eat when it's cold outside. I think their sticky rice is pretty good too.   They have on the menu a Korean beer, \"Hite\". It's smooth and not a bitter beer. If you're ok with spending a little more, try it with a Korean pancake or the rice cake options. The rice cake is spicy.  The Kimchi fried rice *kisses fingers and throws them in the air* is very yummy!"}
{"text":"Yummy!   We ordered food to go: - bibimbap (3/5) Pretty good but I guess not the best take out option - bulgogi (4/5) Very yummy and not overly greasy - glass noodles (5/5) Delicious! I would order this again for sure. FYI has a lot of the same ingredients as bulgogi so Id get one or the other  The only thing bringing the stars down is that.... they forgot to pack the kimchi, which made me feel very very sad.  Ill be back, and I will double check my take out bags!"}
{"text":"I don't get why this place has so many locations when the food is sub par compared with other Korean places. Big menu but most of the items are lackluster. I'd go elsewhere for my fix of Korean.   Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu on Hurontario is a far better option even though their menu is smaller, at least the items taste great."}
{"text":"I love their spicy rice cakes and glass noodles! I would come here with my boyfriend for late night food. They don't split the bill here so sometimes that's hard to coordinate with friends. Other than that, the food is great! I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend this place for inexpensive, no-nonsense Korean food. The staff are friendly, and the prices are fair. We usually order the Bulgogi, Gamjatang, or Bibimbap, which are all reliable favourites. For two people, our bill never goes above $25, and the complimentary pickled cucumber side dish is one of my favourites. Please note that on Friday and Saturday evenings, the place is packed, and you should expect to wait. However, other than that, I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout here and the food was pretty average and bland. I don't think I'd order here again but I was happy with how fast the service was.  I had the steamed dumplings and bulgogi beef entrée. The dumpling skin was pretty thick and the filling was very bland. It tasted like someone boiled some vermicelli and pork bits and wrapped it with the dumpling skin.   The bulgogi dish was average but had a good proportion of peppers, onions, and beef. The entree also came with a side of rice and kimchi which tasted ok. The bulgogi sauce was really watery which didn't appeal to me.   Overall, aside from the fast service, everything was quite average. There is a slim chance that I would go again given my experience with the food but the place seems to be packed during lunch hour."}
{"text":"The seating is too crammed for comfort. For ambiance and seating space, it will not reach 2 star.  Food quality is moderately good. I had the BulGoGi, the quantity was not that generous, but quality wise it was definitely good and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is not spacious. It's too crowded. It doesn't have the best decor. But I guess that's the drawback of having good food and 24 hours service. It's really a nice place to get a fill without having to spend so much money especially coming from a night out. Me and my friends keep coming back every now and then to try the same thing or to try the other food items. When you come in and and just want to get some good food, you won't really care all about the other problems."}
{"text":"The only thing the Owl has going for it is its late hours of operation. For a convoy of Koreans looking to soothe their soju-filled bellies, this place is a beacon in the night with its offering of Kam Ja Tang (pork bone soup; because in Korea nothing is more soothing to the stomach than boiling hot spicy liquids?).  I always love starting off a meal with a decent hammering of banchan (those small little appetizer dishes), but the Owl sucked it up with only unremarkable radish and kimchi on offer.   My girl and her cousins (read: lots of Koreans) all ordered the Kam Ja Tang, but weren't too impressed. I usually eschew Kam Ja Tang (who the hell wants to deal with all those bones?) for Yuk Ke Jang (spicy beef soup), but as yelp laments about two stars: Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Mostly consistent Korean spot that's 24/h. Good food in Toronto is very hard to find after midnight believe it or not. You can come at anytime and you can expect a nice hot bowl of Pork Bone Soup served to you in minutes. Strangely enough, all of the Owl of Minerva's are very inconsistent with one another. I would say this location has the best Pork Bone Soup and selection of side dishes. I always avoid the Spadina location even though it's a lot closer to me."}
{"text":"midnight starvation up late in mississauga will lead you to owl  red and yellow paint part of their branding i guess it's not too pleasing  decent korean love the extensive menu soups, apps, rice dishes  owl's food isn't tops depth of flavour is lacking but it's not the worst  at 2am though, maybe after a party, it does hit the spot"}
{"text":"We came on a weekday evening and only waited for a few minutes to be seated. We ordered the Jap Chae & Kalbi which was enough for 3 people. Both tasted pretty good although the Kalbi was more chewy than usual. Might come back in the future to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me. Solid late night option when you want to get your Korean food fix. My favourite dish to order here is the kamjatang (pork bone soup). They give you a good portion of pork along with potatoes and kimchi and a bowl of white rice. They also give you a variety of banchan (side dishes) such as kimchi, radish, spicy cucumber and bean sprouts. You may also ask for more side dishes at no extra cost.   There are a wide variety of dishes to choose from here such as kalbi, bulgogi and green onion pancakes. I recently ordered a combo consisting of spicy bulgogi, rice and a fried egg, solid but not spectacular. For a place open 24/7 you could certainly do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Had the pork and kimchi soup. It came with rice and some other small side dishes. Very reasonable prices. Will definitely return to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"This location is good - my go-to spot for all my favourite Korean dishes. I love that they have a daily special every day for $6.99. But my favorite favorite dish will always be their Gam Ja Tang (Pork Bone soup with a bowl of rice). I can't never finish one myself, but when I take it out of the fridge the next day, I know it's made well because it's all gelatine i.e lots and lots of pork bones used for soup base and not fillers.  Also, the price is decent too."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I even begin? I'm going to put the same amount of energy and thought into writing this review as they did preparing my meal.  - horrible attitude from the staff team, not a single trace of politeness (slams menu on the table, rude comments and demeanor,  etc) - dish came in a dirty bowl - was the standard for hygiene this low? (See picture below)  - dish had a distinct taste of cigarette ash - I paid in cash and before I was able to collect my change, the waitress tried to take the money away and asked (still rudely) if I was going to leave her a 40% tip. After I told her no, she was literally moving the tip tray away from me as I was gathering up my money (I ended up tipping 20% which was against my will) - I felt immediately sick after the meal   Save yourself the money, headache and stomache, and go to another Korean restaurant that treats you with basic decency and serves better food. Owl of Minerva? Pass."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup at 9:30am? No problem! Since this is a 24 hour restaurant, you can really come anytime. I thought I might be the only one in the restaurant but when I arrived, there were 3 other tables, and another 3 groups got seated while I was there. Everybody needs a bowl of meaty, spicy, soul satisfying soup on a cold Toronto morning! Owl saved my random craving once again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Although there is a wait but it is to be expected as the food is good. The pork bone soup and kalbi is tasteful. The only thing I can mention they can improve is their location and space as it is right beside Asian supermarket which is almost impossible to find parking. Otherwise, this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"Very flavourful food !! BBQ beef spicy and nice. Quick service and prices are good too !!"}
{"text":"I go to this place often because it's open late.  Their pork bone soup with tofu and kimchi is my favourite out of all their dishes.  I've also tried the dumpling in soup and bulgogi.    They're not always consistent.  Their side dishes vary, which is alright but their pork bone soup also varies in quality.  Sometimes their pork bone soup is not \"falling off the bones\", which how it should always be, IMO.  The restaurant is very simple looking.  For their low prices, I am willing to accept that this place kind makes me feel dirty.  I don't think they take debit/credit but they have this ATM machine in the front, the kind that charges you a few dollars to withdraw money from - so try to bring cash  I'd definitely come back for those late night fixes though."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time I ordered the yukgaejang which is a spicy beef stew. However, I do not see ANY beef in the soup. Only veggies. And the price of that stew was not cheap at all. The second time I ordered gamjatang, which was pretty good. The meat was tender and there was a decent amount of meat. Both time, the service was fine, wasn't very attentive but wasn't really bad.  50-50 chance of coming back"}
{"text":"Okay so I confess, I am an Anglo background white guy who was brought up on boring old meat and potatoes, but as you can see from my other reviews, I far prefer ethnic cuisine. However some parts of the critter (not sure exactly which parts these were or which critter they were from) just don't seem to belong on my plate!  it started out well as I was delighted to find 24 hr Korean at 1 AM-ish! Started with #2 Bulgogi which was excellent and I would highly recommend. Then moved on to #20 Soondaekuk which is allegedly \"Korean style sausage soup, rice\". Either they gave me the wrong item and just didn't want to own up to it, or it is the strangest sausage ever that looks like innards and soup that smells rather unappetizing.   When I questioned whether I received 20 they insisted I had, even though sausage/miscellaneous critter tidbit, looked nothing like the item pictured on the menu. Although I do enjoy spice, it was actually quite spicy, which seemed odd as the spicy menu items said spicy. When I pointed this out and they said that it was supposed to be spicy and if the menu says spicy then it means really spicy!?  I eat at A LOT of restaurants and can count on one hand the number of times I've sent back food. I said I wasn't happy with the item, but not wanting to be a dick, I offered to pay for it anyway, but said I would be much happier if they let me order something else instead. After a few iterations of them insisting it was 20 and me explaining that I was willing to pay for it but not eat it, they offered to let me choose a substitute. I said I'd take my replacement dish to go as the soup debate allowed my brain time to realize my belly was full. I waited another 10 minutes and then received the bill for the one item I had eaten and neither received, nor was charged, for the replacement item I ordered??  Would I go back? Hell yes, #2 was delicious and even more delicious for a random 1 AM find on yelp! I would just be much more careful what I ordered and absolutely avoid anything which didn't specify which variety of critter constituted the carnage!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed owl before!  This is one of my favourite places, it's so convenient close to home and open 24/7! It's a good place to go for any meal especially breakfast as they're a lot less busy in the morning. Past 10PM there is always a line out the door.  I always order the spicy beef bulgogi and it's excellent! I've had bulgogi at other places and this place is excellent! It's always loaded up with glass noodles and meat. I also like the spicy chicken it's great as well I could have both, but I could never finish eating both. Both are huge dishes!  The service here is always quick and efficient, can never complain about that. I've also had take out from them a few times, they're quick for take out and it's always hot.   This is definitely one of my favourite spots in Mississauga I could come here everyday!!  I can't speak for their other locations as this is the only one I've been to."}
{"text":"Those familiar with Mississauga will understand when I say this: Owl of Minerva is the Korean \"Tremendous\". But since it is Korean and not Chinese, it's a much healthier option, just less fun. If you're a fan of Kimchi, they have a quite lovely one here that you can even buy directly from them."}
{"text":"I always remember this place as a 4.5 star restaurant.. been coming here for years and years and years. But it's a bit sad to say that the quality has been dwindling over time.  But still by far my most favourite place for Pork Bone Soup!!! Maybe because the soup has an extra kick that no other Toronto Korean Restaurant has... for some reason all other restaurant's Pork Bone Soup all taste the same.. but this one is different. It just tastes better.. lol, end of review.  One more thing, you must have Pork Bone Soup here even if you prefer other Korean dishes over Pork Bone Soup."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not great either...so mediocre it is!  One thing that makes me not enjoy this location is the seating.  It is BEYOND dreadful if you get seated in the middle of the restaurant.  They squish in tables so close together, you can literally be eating next to strangers as if they're part of your family!  To me, this means only one thing...turn-and-burn!  (If there's a fire and you're one of the unfortunate ones sitting in the centre, God help you!!!)  Prices aren't cheap, a PBS is $10, Bibimbap is $12, etc.  Very standard pricing.  Side dishes are also very standard:  kimchi, sprouts, kimchi radish, & pickled cukes.  Service is alright, not super friendly, not rude.  I think their job is to get as many people in as possible and out just as quickly.  This location is busy merely due to the convenient location.  The fact that it's open 24-hrs doesn't hurt either.  Nothing that I ate can be described as \"delicious\" or \"I can't wait to come here again\".  There are much better options in the area!"}
{"text":"Good decent amount of food and quick service. Beware of the cashier tho, she can be rude sometimes. LoL."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different other than Kai Chi so on a whim popped in here. Decor pretty pedestrian but staff nice and service good. Lots of tvs with non stop Korean music videos , fun to watch . Food was very good , plentiful and prices cheaper than Kai Chi. Even asked if we wanted more kimchi. Cash only . No draft beer which is a bummer but bottled beer is reasonable. Next time will head to Clinton for a pint first. Had pork bone soup. Resolved now to try every Korean restaurant in Seaton Village as we are on a roll."}
{"text":"I've been to this place more times than any other restaurant and I absolutely love how convenient, affordable, and accessible it is.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and my favorite dishes are bulgogi and kam ja tang. Both are very filling, with the kam ja tang being a little spicy. Definitely try these two!  Of course, the service isn't amazing. They serve you some side dishes after you're seated but after that, you're pretty much left on your own and it's hard to get their attention.   Nevertheless, I love this spot. It's one of the few places open 24/7, which makes it perfect for late night meals."}
{"text":"Let me start off with saying that before I went to this place, i didn't really dabble my palate in Korean Food.   With that said, I have, however, went to quite a few other Korean restaurants since (not around the area though), and my experience with those other ones were different in terms of palate than this one. but that's another story.  I went there with my family because my mom heard from her friends that this was a great place of pork-bone soup. So that's what we ordered. The price was a little...pricer than we'd liked, but w/e, if it was good food, then it'd be worth it. But unfortunately, it wasn't great. I'm not sure if it's because the expectations were raised higher due to people praising how good it was, but I didn't enjoy the broth, or any part of the dish, actually. it just wasn't as flavorful as I'd have liked. It was simply really spicy without the aroma and flavor that should've come out if you cook the broth with the bones/meat for a long time. (i have tried pork-bone soups at other places since and they were actually great, so I'm pretty sure it's not because of the \"recipe\" or how it's just supposed to be).   Maybe it's just me. Maybe it just doesn't suite my palate and I just don't like something if it's only spicy with no other flavours. but if you're into that, then this is for you :)."}
{"text":"So I'm nocturnal and this place gets 3 stars for being open 24 hours and NOT being a Coney Island. Woot! Woot! Owl of Minerva is a small restaurant in North York that serves up Korean food. We ordered the pork bone and potato soup  along with GunManDu (deep fried Korean dumplings).   The soup is quiet large, there is a massive pork bone bathing in pork broth. The meat is so tender it's legitimately falling off the bone and the broth wasn't too salty. The soup is garnished with peppercorns and onions. Alongside the soup they provide a small dishes of rice and three different types of kimchi that accompany the meal, all of which were really tasty.  The GanManDu was great. The dumplings had a great crunch to them and the meat tasted spiced and juicy.   The prices were decent. They have a special where you can order a dish and 4 beers for $19.99 which is a good deal considering each beer is $3.50 without the special.   I'll definitely be going back there for some late night grub."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Service was even worst...When we asked the waiter if there are any side dishes , he replied with \"do you see I'm busy?\".The waiter was absolutely rude. Will surely not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"There are many better options for pork bone soup in Toronto. Most reasonable Korean will admit this place is a dump. It does not classify as a hole in the wall mom and pop shop as it it has several locations but they continue to serve the same awful gruel. This place is near the bottom of my list of korean restaurants in TO. Sorry did I call this place a restaurant? I meant this dive."}
{"text":"Got here at about 1am last night. To my surprise, the joint was fairly busy and there were only 2-3 empty tables. We sat and we're served promptly. I ordered the famous pork bone soup and was not disappointed at all. The soup was hot and the meat was soft and tender. It wasn't quite 'fall off the bone' as i usually like it but for a 24 hour place, I can't complain. My friends ordered the spicy rice cakes. It came in a fairly big portion and boy was it spicy. If you enjoy spicy food, it's a must order.  Altogether it's a great late night place if you're looking for something cheap and quick.  I'd give it 4.5 but Yelp wouldn't let me."}
{"text":"OMG I set there for bloody seven minutes, while the waitresses were talking to each other so happily. They didn't even give me the menu. So, I stood up and go. I will never go there anymore."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall. This place is relatively busy throughout the night. Late at night, the party crowd is here. Its fairly noisy and crowded, but I have never had to wait a significant time for a seat.   I remember when they basically had 2 things on their menu, and now has expanded to many things. You don't really come here for the ambiance, but for 2 main dishes: (i) pork bone soup and (ii) LA galbi ribs. Both are delicious. I've been to Owl at its various locations many times and always come back.   Pro tip: if you come here with a few people, get the pork bone soup that comes comes on the stove."}
{"text":"One of my favourites in mississauga! Love that its open late of course and the food is really great! It's got that home cooked meal vibe - recommend the udon, jap chae, and pork bone soup :)"}
{"text":"The customer service here isn't that great, but I'm a strong believer in the idea that if you're looking for excellent customer service you don't really go to a hole in the wall type of restaurant. You go to Owl of Minerva for the food and the fast turnover in tables, and because they're open 24 hours, not fine dining services.  Anyways, love the food! Great place to go if you just want to stuff your face with yummy carbs. The servers look tired and don't say very much, but I don't really care. Give me my food, let me enjoy it, give me the bill. It's a win-win situation."}
{"text":"The Owl Of Minerva is open 24 hours, I give them props for the dedication. :-) I recently ordered the Dolsot BiBimBap and the BulGoGi Busot JjiGea.  The BBB was I thought not very tasty, all the vegetables tasted roughly the same with the buttery taste, and overall the dish was mediocre. That being said, it was a tiny bit of ground beef with vegetables and an egg on top. So Blanche is to be expected. The BGG was completely the opposite. People should order this dish more often. It's got this awesome sweet soup that is filled with sweet meat, mushrooms, some noodles, and a few greens (leeks?). I would have loved a little more noodles in this dish, in fact, a little more of all ingredients would have been awesome (except the meat, there was a good amount of that).  If you have had enough of the Beef bone soup try this one, so tasty (you might just have to order two!).  I plan on going back and trying a few other dishes and updating as necessary.  BBB-2/5  BGG-4.5/5"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and quick service. The fact that they are open 24/7, it's definitely a place that I would recommend to all of my friends and family"}
{"text":"Its nyengmyeon season (lengmian).  Mmmm.  Try their bibim nyengmyeon - gorgeous home-style gochuchang, not too sweet.  Mmmm, noodles nice and stretchy.  The kimchi in this restaurant is fantastic.  I can go through 3 panchan bowls myself ....  Love this place.  They also serve a lot of difficult-to-find ttukbegae here -- different beef broths, etc."}
{"text":"Confident place for a late night snack. This place is open 24/7. They have a variety of Korean food and soups.   The pork bone soup and kimchi stew here is delicious.  Overall, the foods average. Just like any other Korean restaurant.   Cash only if your bill is less then $20.  But there is credit and debit available for bills over $20"}
{"text":"Power was out and I was starving so decided to go to Owl. Place was extremely busy as always, so I got takeout. Pork bone soup of course! Delicious and just the right amount of spice. Incredibly fair value for price. I normally get the kalbi too as my go to orders. Both come with plain white rice and kimchi sides. Plenty of food with all that. Deducting stars for atmosphere (cafeteria like), service (brisk but abrupt..definitely trying to get through the customer queue). Good place to go for a fill your stomach type meal."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is pretty good! (Price is $7.99) Try to come here before 7pm for dinner or else you might be waiting in line."}
{"text":"Good authentic Korean. Service was slow and our server didn't speak English. She knew some words but very broken. I like how this place doesn't try to be Japanese and sticks to only Korean dishes. I really enjoyed the little free apps they serve consisting of kimchi, sprouts etc.  They're open late and prices are reasonable. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Thankyou OOM for always being a drunken late night option. Reliable, dependable, you're the only thing that matters at 3am."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup broth was a bit bland... The meat was impeccably soft though  Dumplings were great, short ribs were full and flavourful... I was pleasantly surprised  With so many bars around I'm glad this place is 24hrs"}
{"text":"The food is good for days/nights when I don't feel like cooking and/or when in the area and it's lunchtime! Service depends upon the wait staff. The English speaking ones are pretty decent and have no issue with fulfilling requests, whereas the two older women who appear to run the establishment get angry when asked for things. One day I did take out and asked specifically for banchan; I was told I'd have to pay extra. If dining in, that would have been served to me regardless but apparently it was a problem for them as I was taking my food to go! Slightly annoyed, I asked what the difference was between dining in and take out. Probably concerned I'd make a stink about it, they packed me some.  Have ordered and eaten the following items at both the Mississauga and Toronto locations: Bulgogi, JapChae, Dolsot Bibimbap, Ojinguh Bokeum (which is really good!) and their lunch specials.  Meals are tasty, filling and affordable."}
{"text":"Love this pork bone soup since university, still the best in town after 12 years, this is must go in tdot."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. It was packed! The food was okay,  HUGE portions though. The service was okay. I feel they were over worked and a little tired from the lunch rush.   One word of warning, this place doesn't seem to have AC. It was brutal."}
{"text":"Went for a girls night! So packed but really home-y and lively in there. Great service, fast, chaotic yet orderly. Good price too. Bought KamJaTang (pork bone soup) $8.99, Ramen and L.A Kalbi Beef (s) $15.99. Didn't really eat the side dishes though. Food was fulling and good."}
{"text":"This HAS been my go-to place for korean food. They only take cash which sucks, and they have an atm inside. I've been there many times after a good dirty drunken night at the dance cave.  HOWEVER... Last night I did not have a good experience here. We came in as a group of 4 and were seated immediately, there were about 3 other groups there.  Usually when you have more than 3 people, you get a larger sides of banchan. We were given 3 tiny little dishes with no kimchi or plates. As a Korean, I know how some of our people can be, and it seemed to me that they made this assumption (about not wanting kimchi)  because I was the only asian person in the group... I tried several times to get the attention of the waitstaff, and they both (two men) walked by me several times ignoring me. When I finally asked, the waiter said \"You'll get plates when the food comes.\" ..umm what? I asked him for plates and he basically said no. Then he and the other waiter stood at the back of the room, texting and talking bullshit. If a customer asks for plates, fucking bring plates. It's not that hard.   The food came shortly after and the waiter brought the kimchi along with it, after we asked for it. We all got very tiny little bowls as dishes, and once again, for the bill and the take away box, we had to try to get their attention multiple times.  This experience left me feeling uneasy and embarrassed that I brought my friends to this restaurant. The waiters were complete dicks, and I got the feeling they didn't like our group because we were of mixed ethnicity. All of the other seemingly Korean people in there got large dishes of banchan and better service."}
{"text":"The odd time I crave Korean and pork bone soup. I use to live at Yonge and Finch where my friends and family would frequent the Yonge location.   My family decided we wanted a good pork bone soup. We arrived to the restaurant and the restaurant was about 70% full. We were quickly seated and served a cup of tea to start. We looked at the menu where there was plenty to chose from. My sister wanted to get the pork bone soup for my mom where she thought my mom would enjoy pork bone itself.   The prices were a bit high compared to other Asian cuisines.   We order a variety of dishes from pork bone soup, rice cake, sesame noodles, and Korean rice dish.   When the food arrived we were pleased with most of the dishes but we found the pork bone soup was a bit salty. My mom preferred the soup base to be less infused with spices and salt.   Overall, if you are looking for a hearty meal of spice and flavour - owl serves that purpose"}
{"text":"AWESOME late nite / 24 hr  KALBI TANG or KAMJATANG place is a lil dirty, service is slow, but for 3 am yum at a decent price this place is the place to be in north york (even though the selection of late night places in the area are very slim - subway is open till 3am across the street) i give them props for dealing with all the drunken stupers though, who roll in there wanting some home style korean!  kimchi is very spicy! i choke everytime. hahaha, but they do give you as much as you want."}
{"text":"I think this place is ok. Usually don't go to other owls but Oakville doesn't have many choices . the food is fine there"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to Korean restaurant! This place is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The food is authentic tasting, very similar to what I had tried in Korea. I have tried most items on the menu and there was no dish which was disappointing. The service is always good, as the waiters are very kind and helpful.   The interior of the restaurant is not fancy but rather more casual and relaxed. During the busy hours, tables are combined and you may share a table with others. Starting from 8pm to 12am, it is very busy and the wait time can range from 10 minutes to 20 minutes.   Whenever I am craving Korean food, this is the place I go. The food is amazing, and not to mention that the price is very affordable. They give you many side dishes of kimchi, bean sprouts, radish and cucumbers free of charge! I would recommend this restaurant to a friend and definitely revisit."}
{"text":"1 point for being open 24/7 1 point for having pork bone soup with rice & sides for only $8.99!!  -1 for THE LOOOONG WAIT  -1 For freezing dining area -1 for Large Kal Bi (5pcs) which cost $21.99 (+tax) It's craaaazy!  Would I come back? Yes! For late night pork bone soup craving!!!"}
{"text":"I Love this place. The food is great. Best place to chill with friends. It's my favorite Korean place bc I use to come here and friends. I cant wait to go back even tho I go alone I can't stay away from the wonderful food."}
{"text":"I used to come here every time I had a craving for pork bone soup. That dish is absolutely amazing and typically everyone is very nice and friendly.  However, my most recent experience was beyond horrible. I will not be returning.  I took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he ordered chicken broth soup with noodles. That dish probably had less than 1oz of chicken and the soup was very bland. He took one bite and didn't like it. He didn't tell me that he didn't like it, but I noticed that he wasn't eating and he eventually told me it was horrible. We sent back the dish and in doing so, was treated like garbage. The servers kept asking us what my boyfriend wanted her to do about it even though he clearly stated he lost his appetite. Another server proceeded to raise his voice at us and told us, \"You should read the menu. You can't do this at restaurants\". I defensively replied back and stated that my boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry (cook and server respectively) and he stormed away.  I am beyond mortified at how unprofessional they are at handling guest complaints and therefore will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location of Owl of Minerva since they opened and have observed a few things.   This place is also open 24 hours!! And no MSG added to the dishes is a definite plus.  In winter, this location is FREEZING cold! We visited twice last winter and had to keep our winter coats on throughout our entire meal.   When they're busy, they try to rush you out the door the second you finish eating. They'll come over and start clearing and cleaning the table while you're still sitting and will even take away your tea glasses without offering a refill.  Having said all that, I can't give it less than 4 stars because the #1 (pork bone soup) is freakin' amazing!!!! The broth is so tasty, the pork bone meat is so tender and soft and the portion is huge for such a reasonable price.   The waiters and waitresses are quite friendly as long as it's not too busy. In fact, on our most recent visit the waiter was really nice, asking us questions and being very solicitous.   As mentioned, the pork bone soup is our favourite but there are other delicious menu items. We particularly like the kalbi, bibimbap, spicy bulgogi and the side dishes are plentiful and refilled if you ask.  The restaurant is quite clean and so are the washrooms although there's only a single washroom for men and one for women, so you may have to wait when they're busy."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time as I would have a huge craving for their Gamjatang or Pork Bone Soup. First and foremost, this place is open 24/7 so whether you are with your family or you are drunk with your friends, this place is 101 comfort food. The prices are cheap and the sides are alright, essentially they are different vegetables with spicy sauce smothered on.  Foodwise, this place has a variety of korean dishes including their famous pork bone soup. I must say, their pork bone soup is absolutely delicious, however if it is your first time eating it, a word of warning it is quite difficult to eat as there a lots of bones you must pick through to get all the meat (hence the name pork bone soup). One complaint I do have is that although it is comfort food, the pork bone soup is actually very very fattening. I brought it home once and kept it in the fridge to save for the next day and when I took it out the next day the soup had turned into a jello like substance meaning it must have been FULL of fat. However, if you don't mind this fact, the food here is still very good and if you are looking for good korean food this is a good place to go (not as good as the tofu place right down the street).  Service is fantastic and generally very quick. They are very friendly and there are little buttons on the side in which you can press and servers come (fantastic system should be like this everywhere). If you are looking for cheap and soupy comfort food, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and ordered the pork bone soup, chicken with egg on top of rice and squid noodles. My husband and I loved the pork bone soup. It was delicious! My daughter liked the chicken with egg on top of rice. The squid noodles were good. Service was friendly and food came out very quick. Will definitely return when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"It's open 24/7 and they make/serve really quick, which is really convenient if you're a night owl (hence the name Owl of Minerva i'm guessing), but i found the food to be pretty bad..  Got the bulgogi which was soggy and drenched in oil.  My friend got the pork bone soup and said it was good, definitely not breathtaking. Portion sizes were average and price is pretty cheap.  There's so many amazing Korean restaurants in the area i wouldn't bother with this one. It's like Korean fast food IMO."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their Pork Kim Chi stew! That's what I always get when I go to Owls. I also love that they are open 24/7 so no matter what time I am craving for some kim Chi stew, I know I can get it :P   I've also tried their Pork bone soup which was delicious but I don't really like getting my hands dirty while eating in public LOL their chicken rice and spicy rice cake is also very good! That's the only things I've ever tried but I was satisfied with everything I've ordered!   3 stars because service is a hit and miss. The ladies are very nice and sweet. I usually ask to add glass noodles in my kim Chi stew and it was no problem. However when I get the guy server he's really adamant that they don't do that... anyway, also 3 stars because there's so many fruit flies!!! It's so annoying trying to enjoy my meal and swapping fruit flies away at the same time. Dear god help me if I've ever ended up eating any fruit flies here   Id still return just for the kim Chi stew and the convenience of it being opened all the time!"}
{"text":"Service was good and food came out fast but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Mississauga has a wealth of great Korean restaurants and often most of them are so reasonably priced that you often feel like it's the best deal ever.  It's a comforting and homey cuisine that is presented out in the GTA West.  Owl of Minerva has many other restaurants across the GTA and their Mississauga one just lacks the same flavour profile that their North York and downtown Toronto has done.  This is a busy busy place... and perhaps this is where it challenges the staff in providing good service.  I found them to be aloof and not quick which resulted in luke warm food being served.  In addition to lacklustre service, the restaurant environment feels a bit aged and not quite maintained.  It's 'clean' but I detect an oily film that makes the table top feel grimy.  The menu reads like most Korean places... meat dumplings, hearty bone soups, cold noodles, tofu soups, bim bim bap, etc.  Our order is placed (1 Pork bone soup, 1 spicy tofu soup, and 1 mandu dumpling order) and we see it sitting at the pass.  Our dumpling order is not as good as the ones we have at Hurontario and Dundas Korean restaurants.  The skin is thicker and doughier (not in a good way) and slightly smaller than other places.  Because it didn't arrive hot, it just didn't have anything going for it.  The pork bone soup wasn't bad but my tablemate mentioned that it was a bit light on the flavour.  It felt watered down or didn't have enough time to extract the pork flavour while making the broth. My spicy tofu soup isn't bad but it certainly lacked in content.  It had tofu but little to nothing else.  For the price point, it's ok but I feel like you can just go east for 10 minutes for much better service and food that truly shows how yummy Korean cuisine can be."}
{"text":"I was here last night for the first time ever and my overall experience was OK.. my boyfriend had been here before so i assumed it wasn't a bad place to eat. he had bulgogi (korean beef) with rice, and i had gom tang/ gomguk (like assorted beef soup with rice) i was not impressed with my gom tang, it hardly had any taste to it. literally it tasted like water, not that water has any taste - but that's my point; it tasted like nothing! I still ate it however i did add a lot of salt in the soup so that helped somewhat. the service i would give a 2.5/5 because the employees don't respond to you, even if you wave down a waiter they'll just ignore you.   i did find my bf's bulgogi dish appetizing, along with the kimchi.  although my gom tang wasn't as expected, i will probably be back here on a random night craving for some korean food. i am pretty sure there are better dishes they have to offer.   pretty convenient that there's a private parking lot. (that's a plus for me bc we hate looking for parking and paying the ticket in general)"}
{"text":"This was the next on my list of places to try pork-bone soup.   Upon walking in, my first impression was \"Do I REALLY want to eat here?!?!\" Wow. The place definitely has a hint of sketchiness. I can't quite pinpoint what gives, exactly, but there's some sketchy vibes going on for sure.  No air conditioning - not sure whether it was just broken or they don't have it. You can feel the slight tinge of humidity in the air and the low buzzing sound of fans whirling.   Each table and set of chairs are kind of kitschy - random and do match others, as if collected from various garage sales.    I sucked it up, noticing the place was pretty full (surely for a reason) and grabbed a table.   Service was very prompt and friendly and my order (pork bone soup, of course) was taken immediately. Appetizers were brought to the table straight away. Soup arrived a few minutes later, delivered on a plastic push-cart (cute!)  I got 5 appetizers so I was pleased, most places serve 3 or 4.   The pork bone soup itself was good. I liked that the broth was not oily/fatty (Ka-Chi's is tastier, yet often bubbling with lots of added oil). The meat here was good - tender and fall off the bone, I didn't have any problem with bone shards as mentioned by another reviewer. The soup didn't have the usual sprouts and cabbage added, but it did have some green onions and whole white pepper corns sprinkled on top which both looked and tasted nice.  This place just has the real genuine FEEL of being in Asia. I immediately felt as if I had just stumbled in to some roadside restaurant after a 12-hour-overnight-bus-ride-from-hell packed with chickens, goats and onions. Loud Korean love songs were playing and a few families were laughing together and enjoying a cheap meal. I've been do at least a dozen places in Korea Town and this is the first time a place has made me feel this way!!  I would go back, just for the ambiance.   Cheap too - $7 including tax."}
{"text":"We used to love coming here at all sorts of hours of the day for pork bone soup. Now the portions got smaller, takeout portion super small and prices went way up!!! $$$ we don't go here much anymore. Today yuk kae jang + pork bone = 29!!!! What a rip off. Sorry owl, we don't love you anymore."}
{"text":"It's been a while since i was last here and the price definitely went up. I remember it used to be 6.95 per dish and now it's about 9.99 for most of the dishes.   My friend who lives in the area is a frequenter and we went in through the back to get take out, only to walk by the back terrace with people eating Korean stone bbq outdoors...so cool! We said we are going to come back for this and kept going with our take out.  We ordered the Spicy Pork, Chap Jae (Clear noodles), and Pork Bone Soup. The portions are pretty small. Note that if you get take out, they will only give you two side dishes placed into the same bowl: kimchi and the spicy radishes.   The spicy pork was really good, the pork bone soup was as good as i remembered it, but the noodles were a little bland.   This is the go to place for a lot of ppl who are done clubbing so if you com here at 2-3am on a weekend, you will see a lot of tired, drunk, scantily-dressed Asian girls with mascara running down their eyes.   How do I know?  I was one of them...(a long time ago)"}
{"text":"For the bbq is kind of cheap but idk why i didnt feel interested in it. They just have the pork belly for bbq only, more than 20$ but a lot, if we compare w other restaurants, it is cheap! They also serve u with 2 pieces of butter, very small, didnt make the meat change to be more tasty.  Banchan is normal as others one and ofc u can refill for free.  The soup was okay, but i dont know why wasnt hot enough and make me felt \"hmmmmm, miss sth, i need more sth \"  The servers were ok, but if they smile, become perfect!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a really big fan of this place since it consistently provides good food at affordable prices.  I usually order the same dishes with a few new ones just to explore different Korean cuisine.  L.A. Kalbi and Spicy Seafood Soup are my regulars, and recently I tried the Fried Pork Cutlets, and Pork Bone Soup.  One thing I really like about Korean food is that it gives off the impression of being really healthy since the dishes consist of great vegetable portions, in addition to the fresh banchan.  I can't wait until the summer to try their Cold Noodle Soup (Seasonal Availability) as I've heard good things about this dish.    Service here is pretty straightforward; staff will come to get your order and bring out dishes, and whenever you need them, they are relatively easy to call for.  No complaints, except for the lack of freedom in tipping for larger groups.  They do charge 15% auto-gratuity, which I would have ended up giving always, but this can be a problem for others.  I think it was cash only for $20 and under orders (I don't remember clearly though)  Atmosphere is a basic asian restaurant, not very modern or sleek, but it is well-kept and clean.    Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to those seeking for consistent high quality Korean dishes at affordable pricing!"}
{"text":"This is a packed little restaurant, with parking in the back (and you can also come in from the back, just don't get lost and trek through the kitchen). For a group of 4, we got the family size Gamjatang (pork bone soup, comes with 2 rice) for $23;99, japchae (glass noodles with veggies) $8.99 and beef kalbi (small, $15.99, comes with 1 rice). The kicker is that the delicious little side dishes are unlimited, so we had tons of picked cucumbers, spicy potatoes, bean sprouts and kimchi. And man, their kimchi is INTENSE in a good way - you'll be breathing fire all night!  The pork bone soup comes in a large table-stove, and come with about 6 pieces of pork bone, varying sizes. Nice and tender, and the broth is delicious. There's rice cakes and other goodies floating around in the soup too. The server said it's good for 2 people, but comes with a lot more than 2 person portion - just think of it as proportional to the individual pork bone soup (8.99).  Japchae was yummy, but there's no meat in it. The kalbi was also good, and sizable for a \"small\" - overall a good meal but nothing fantastic...likely will be back in the future. More of a 3.5 star but rounding up to a 4."}
{"text":"What it lacks in service, decor and ambiance it makes up for in being open really late and being *totally fine*. I like their pancakes, their bibimbap doesn't hold a feather to Luck Soon's but is acceptable, and their pork bone soup is fine if you don't look at it!  Basically the Owl is greasy chopstick. Accept its flaws as laws and eat. You know what you're there for, and it will do.   Soft soft points: Owl of Minerva is where, at 4 am, I first said the L word to my boyfriend.   (Lesbian.)"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Owl because of the many good things I hear about it. I came here for dinner with one of my friends today. My friend ordered the pork bone soup and I ordered the ox tail soup. Both soups came with white rice and a few side dishes.   I did not expect the ox tail soup to be BLAND. The first sip of the soup tasted like water with a hint of ox tail flavour. Just a tad hint! I had to spoon in some salt and some spices they had. After flavouring the soup, it just tasted like water mixed with salt and a bit of spice. I was not impressed. I tried by friend's pork bone soup and it was delicious, however I've had better. (My friend said the same as well). The side dishes were not that great either...  Another obeservation I've noticed is that the soup was not that hot even though it was served in a stone bowl. Usually, when soup is served in a stone bowl it's super hot to the point that it burns your tongue. The stone bowls help conserve the heat while you're munching away however, in my case... it didn't own up to its responsibility.. ): Perhaps, the soup was not served hot to begin with so I shouldn't be blaming the stone bowl haha.  Nevertheless, it was an inexpensive meal. The pork bone soup was about $8 and the ox tail soup was about $9. I might visit Owl again, but for now... it's a low 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get some Korean comfort food in a casual and comfortable setting. A quick survey of the adjacent tables will tell you that the pork bone soup is their specialty.   I am not a fan of the loud Korean pop music, the tap water served in aged plastic bottles, the sticky tables and the heavy use of oil in pretty much all their dishes. I do like the quick and friendly service and the fact that they pretty much never close.   Contrary to other reviews, I find the portion sizes to be smaller than what you get elsewhere. That is certainly true about the banchan. I believe they are better Korean options in the area for the same price."}
{"text":"This is now my go to place to get pork bone soup  or spicy pork with rice.  Very good food but I wish they accepted debit since I pretty much only walk with plastic, so it's actually affected how many times I choose to go to Owl- I'll opt to go to Kachi or Mom's in the area if I don't have cash instead."}
{"text":"If you care about decor then maybe you might want to try someplace else. If you want good gamjatang then well you're in the right spot. you only catch me at this location on an early sunday morning for Gamjatang (potato soup) cause it's really the only place open before the usual 11am restaurants ( ie pho). this place is 24/7 cause well for people like me who get hungry in the early morning after a night of gallivanting the streets of toronto. Ive been here for the soup many times only once did it come out luke warm. So im usually happy with owl. i dont think ive been here on an evening but im guessing its a comfortable place to sit and hang with some friends and soju. who wouldnt want to hang with soju anyway.   oh and on a side note there is this small korean grocery store just below owl where you can pick up some banana milk. that stuff is da bomb!"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is amazing!!!  Only $8.99 as well!  Looking around, it seemed like 85% of the other customers at the restaurant also ordered the pork bone soup. XD The pork is so tender. The broth is delicious.  The service was fast and decent. There can be a little bit of a wait since this restaurant can get quite packed!  I will definitely come back again for their PBS."}
{"text":"Came here last night a little after midnight and it was completely packed! Just finding parking was a mission. When we finally got in, we waited maybe 15 minutes before we got a table which was fine since turnover here is pretty fast. We all ordered different dishes that my Korean friend recommended and I thought it was pretty good. My friend thought it was pretty authentic for what you could get in the area and everyone was happy. Its a very casual place, which was nice for what we were looking for but its a lot more casual than places I would normally go. We also got a bunch of side dishes and I really liked the cucumber side dish :)   Nice place to get something hot and yummy and hang out with old friends late at night."}
{"text":"Have come here quite a few times- it used to be after clubbing in my 'younger' days, and now I've been coming here in a more sober state. Maybe it's because I'm more sober during my visits now, but I've noticed their quality in their food has started to decline. Most recently the khanpung-gi (spicy sweet and sour chicken) came with hardly any chicken, too much batter and way too deep fried. I still enjoy their Budae jigae (Korean stew with kimchi, sausage, spam, ramen noodles, mandu) - salty but that's the way it's supposed to be! Cheap beer, and they give you lots of panchan dishes to start. They don't hesitate to refill them when you ask."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week to get my Korean fix. I love that the dishes are always fresh, and that the service is quick (most of the time).  Beyond the ever-faithful KamJaTang (Pork Bone Soup), my favourite dishes include the JeYukBokeum (Stir fried marinated pork with spicy sauce on sizzling plate) and KhamPungGi (Deep fried chicken with hot sweet & sour sauce).  My only reservation about this restaurant is that they do not serve a lot of banchan, i.e. korean side dishes. They typicaliy serve bean sprouts, kimchi, pickled cucumber, and picked radish. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place if you're looking for some Korean goodness at any time of the day (literally - they're open 24hrs)."}
{"text":"Awesome late night korean food as they're open 24/7.  My favourites are the pork bone soup, sweet and spicy deep fried chicken. sweet and spicy squid and the kalbi ribs. They also give a variety of banchan, but of those the potatoes are the best."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty full during peak time, but otherwise there won't be a wait.  Definitely my favourite place to go to satisfy my pork bone craving, although sometimes the meat is dry, and for a decent price. Other notable dishes include the kalbi (korean short ribs), sweet and spicy fried chicken as well as the sweet and spicy squid."}
{"text":"After a night across the street at Clintons my friends and I stumbled in here to fill our bellies. I've been wanting to come here for a while and I wish I hadn't been so drunk when I finally did. Based on what I can pull together, the food here was great. We had some sort of spicy chicken dish, pork belly, and something else of which the memory was clearly soaked up by alcohol.   Big props to the staff member who stood at our table to cook the pork belly for us. I don't know if this is standard operating procedure or if they were just worried that a bunch of drunks might burn down the place."}
{"text":"A 24-hour Korean restaurant? YAAASSSSSS.  I was in Toronto for 1 week. I ate here twice. No regrets. It was delicious. My Korean friend said this place is known from its pork bone soup, but I can say that the bibimbap and tteokbokki were sooooo good."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and had a great meal. The restaurant was packed when we arrived but were able to get a tabla in about 10 min.  The dishes came out very quick. We ordered the  stir fried ramen,  pan fried pork dumplings, and DakChulPan  Stir fried spicy chicken on sizzling plate. Overall the food was very good.The ramen was ok , a tad bit on the expensive side at $8.99 for a small portion.   Will definitely come again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Me: What's the most popular Korean restaurant in Mississauga?  Response: Owl of Minerva! This is the response I get every time I ask the aforementioned question. Basically it's popular for the fact that it's open until late at night and is affordable, serving hot comfort food.  We entered to a fully packed restaurant and luckily didn't have to wait too long for a table. The fact that it was so busy resulted in a lack of friendly or attentive service. The server left the menu and walked-off, then arrived 10 minutes later, which is when we had to request for tea and the banchan's, rather than them serving it on their own will. They lacked much vegetarian options, so my friend got the glass noodles, which we do love whenever we get them as banchan's at Song Cooks. I actually wanted the cold noodles, but that was only a seasonal menu option so it wasn't available. I had no option but to get the seafood jigae, which I honestly was not in the mood of eating at all but couldn't think of anything else to order. The food didn't take to long to arrive. The glass noodles were pretty bland, not at all like the kind we were used to from Song Cook's. My jigae was okay...I've had better. Maybe we just ordered the wrong choices...but there surely is a reason for people going crazy for this place. But based on my experience from the service (or lack of) and the meh flavours of the food, I wouldn't really choose the place again when craving Korean food."}
{"text":"Owl of Minerva sets the bar pretty high when it comes to Korean dishes. Their pork bone soup is top notch. I also recommend their spicy pork. I also like their quick service. Now for the cons. The space is tiny but they will try to squeeze you in between two strangers on a six-seater table. They also give you that look that makes it more awkward to enjoy the delicous meal."}
{"text":"2.5 star  2 star + 0.5 star for opening 24/7   Owl of Minerva was the only restaurants that was still open for business when we dropped by around 10:30 pm looking for food. And being opening 24 hours, it was packed even on a Thursday night!  Service was a little disoriented and staff looked a little tired. We ordered:  Gom Tang (Beef Bone Soup) - My friend ate the order without much complaints but I guess he was hungry? All he said it tasted really beefy.  Chicken Kalguksu (handmade, knife-cut wheat flour noodles)  - I love noodles but this bowl of noodles might be one of the worse one I had. The broth and the chicken was good but the noodle has this gluey texture and nasty after taste.  $20 or more total bill for Credit/Debit card use."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to late night food visits. Being open 24 hours, even at 2 am you will find the night owls out there eating away.  The food comes relatively quickly and steaming hot! The soup is actually still boiling when it comes to your table!  We usually order one of the ramen soups and the kalbi which my daughter loves. All meals come with 4 free small side orders of bean sprouts and kimchi cabbage and pickled cucumber.  It's funny because we are so used to only coming here at night, we will not ever have lunch here!"}
{"text":"Great korean restaurant with tons of delicious food. This chain restaurant opens 24 hours and there is always a line"}
{"text":"This place is CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM but on the say we came their machine was broken. Fortunately, Sugar Marmalade (right next to Owl) had an ATM and had kindly let us use theirs.  Ok, on to the food! The short of it is: Food was delicious. We had the pork bone soup, bulgogi, fishcake udon, ddukboki and calamari. Every single one was so yummy we were all really happy with our orders. The banchan was really good too.   The servers were verh nice as well. Very sweet. They informed as that they would be taking credit cards that day because their machine was broken. Which I thought waa very considerate.  Overall we will probably come back. I've been to a few Owls and this is probably the biggest one. Less cramped. Not too loud. Great food and friendly servers."}
{"text":"We came here several times (5-6 times) and every time we come here, the place is packed so we had to wait 10-15mins every time, which is understandable considering the place is pretty small....and food is amazing so I see why the place is packed.  The place may be bustling, but the place is really clean which is impressive since once the customer is out of the table, they clean the table right in front of you and we were seated a minute later.   I've had several things like fishcake soup, bulgogi, spicy bulgogi, spicy pork, gyoza, spicy rice cakes and one more thing on the menu I honestly forgot what it was but the one dish i forgot was not my favorite so probably that's why I forgot what it was ( :P )  Overall, anything that has at least one spice on it was tasty. The one with no spice mark next to the dish is in my opinion, a hit or miss but is worth a try.   The food is filling, affordable and fast service.  I would want card payment and expansion of the place though it would be useful.  I would go back there any time."}
{"text":"I have been there a lot because I am a night owl myself. The place doesnt have a lot of food choices and I often order the kamjatang (pork bone soup) Overall is good I think, although dont expect too much side dishes. They only have 2 to 3 kind avalible.   The only benefit is that its opened 24/7... so when u get hungry, its always ready for you. Also, its more enjoyable when its a cold winter night, a hot steaming pork bone soup will do the trick"}
{"text":"We went at 6:30pm and got the last available table; by 7:00pm the line-up was out the door. The restaurant is in dire need of a facelift, the oldness makes it look dirty even though I think the place is pretty clean. They have a call button at each table so you don't have to wave down a server when you need something. At first the servers came immediately when we pressed the button but as things got crazy it understandably took a while longer. They offer bottomless free kimchi (awesome) and cucumbers, sprouts and something that was like potato but not potato. They have several TVs showing K-pop and some other channels. It is pretty cramped, very loud and it's and in-and-out sort of place. The parking at the back was full to overflowing so we parked right in front on Yonge Street for $3.25 for an hour and a half I think. If you are willing to walk there is free parking on the residential side streets east of Yonge. Everything was too spicy for me but the others in our group loved everything. Portion sizes were good, we had a pitcher of water and tea at our table which was great, but I personally don't think I'll be going back, I'd like to try some other places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"If you're really craving korean food late at night, then Owl will do the trick. But other than that, there are better options around. The food is not bad, but not particularly great either.   I recently had the Dolsot Bibimbap. The portion is decently big, but flavour is just okay. Not enough meat.  I also had the jeyeukbokum  (spicy pork on hot plate). Consistent with the rest of their menu, it was just okay. I've had better, but I've also had worse.  Their prices are just standard too, not cheap, but not expensive either. You could find higher quality korean food for the same price. I'd say their highlight is their gamjatang (pork bone soup). Everyone loves it and I think it's great too. The price is also quite cheap, only a little more than $10.    All in all, it's a decent restaurant thats quite convenient since there's so many locations open late at night. The servers are nice too."}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre. Barebones atmosphere and below average Korean food and I usually like most Korean restaurants! Bimbimbap, pork bone soup, etc.. all the staples were bland and forgettable"}
{"text":"Menu is much more extensive than before -- they have many different dishes available now.  But I still go there for the Gamjatang (spicy potato & pork bone soup), which is great.  Dolsot bibimbap was okay, nothing special.  Kimchi and other side dishes weren't so great.  4 stars for the gamjatang"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came by late night one day because I was extremely hungry and craving some soup.  I ordered the Seafood Tofu Soup and he ordered the Soondaeguk? (SP) I like the kimchi here, it's more fresh than pickled. However, I wish they had better side dishes. Not as good as the Korean food in Toronto but good enough to satisfy the cravings. The prices are more expensive than what I would usually pay for soup but only a couple dollars more.   The service was nice, however it was late at night and a lot of people were just standing around chilling. So that may be a factor.   Overall it was a good experience. Nothing I could hate about the place. I would totally pick Toronto Korean food over this place though."}
{"text":"The foods great here but the service is not the best. The staff looked miserable and annoyed with us. My boyfriend and I had to ask for water 3 different times from two different servers and it still took them 20 min to bring us the water. We even asked the same waitress twice, she came by our table three different times and forgot everytime. My boyfriend and I were happy with the food but he was not too pleased with the service. When he went to pay for the food he didn't tip and the man who was cashing him out called him out for it telling my boyfriend \"You're Canadian you should tip\". My boyfriend and him got into a bit of a spat and then we left. I can understand being frustrated about not receiving tip however getting into an argument with a customer about not giving a tip is completely inappropriate. You want good food and service go to SongsCook."}
{"text":"unassuming place on the first floor of a building I never even noticed when passing by. cash only, there was plenty of places to sit on friday night. appetizers were okay, the dish I saw online wasn't in their menu at all so I just got a bibimbap which was okay but didn't have enough meat in my opinion. price was okay. don't think I'll be back because there are so many places to choose from. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we crave pork bone soup.  Place feels comfortable like home and friendly service."}
{"text":"Good but we prefer the one at christie and bloor :) friendlier service and even though theyre both Owl for some reason the pork bone soup at the one at christie and bloor is better."}
{"text":"Night healthy snack soup with beef and squid but it missing seasoning. The waiters pushing cart on small alley between customers chairs, keep bumping customer chair and the cart. The food is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I go here just for the pork bone soup. It's good, hearty and a perfect fix for some comfort."}
{"text":"My friends and I only get the pork bone soup or the chicken ginseng soup whenever we are here so my 5 star review is only based on those two things.  But man, they are amazing especially during the harsh Toronto Winters.  I still dream about it all the time since I live in Vancouver and I haven't found anything here that compares to it :("}
{"text":"* Delicious Korean food! - Our favourite place. * Fast service! * Reasonably priced! * Ample parking space at the plaza * Come early for lunch and dinner coz they are such a hit! They need to expand. Lol..."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place a few time late nights. There was one night I came with me & couple of friends. Our night went pretty well until my friend saw a mouse running by around the restaurant. We couldn't believe it and we were screaming. We would like to enjoy our food but at the same time there was a mouse running around. At that time we were waiting for our food to come as well so we rush quickly to leave and we also let the server know as well and they denied there was one. Couldn't find it. Anyways I really enjoy there soups and the rice cakes."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is awesome, and that's it!!! Actually the rest part of the restaurant are not that much great, but it's cheap, and ORDER THE PORK BONE SOUP!!! If you are trying stuff like tofu soup, you should go somewhere else, but if you want to have pork bone soup, this is the place you should go. Also, the seafood pancake is also good, haha. The TV is always showing Korean musical shows..."}
{"text":"The food itself is pretty good here - taste and portions. Another plus cause it's one of the only Korean restaurants you can go to late night/ early morning. However, the service is TERRIBLE. My friends and I arrived around 1am. There was one waiter running the whole restaurant. We had to seat ourselves. After waiting 10 minutes, my friend walked over to grab the menus for our table. Another 10 minutes later, the waiter came over with menus, but ended up taking our order right then and there. We ordered the pork cutlet, squid fry, gamja tang, and jok bal. When the food came, he didn't bring us the jok bal so we assumed it would take longer to cook, but it ended up that he never took our order. I can't blame him that he's working alone but they seriously need to get him a helper."}
{"text":"If I can give 0 star there won't be any star to this place. Service is so rude! They put us on a table and then told us to move. Told them we don't want to and chase us out of the store. Don't know what kinda customer service that is. Never had A/C in a summer day. Room is filled with smoke."}
{"text":"I heard so much about Owl,  and was pretty excited to give them a try.  Before entering the restaurant, there was a notice that said, \"cash only\", so my friend and i had to go in search of a bank up and down Bloor.   Once paper money was ready, we went back to Owl.  We were excited for soup as it was a cold day.  My friend ordered tofu soup with seafood, while i ordered pork bone soup.  I wanted to compare pork bone soup from this place to the other places to see how it was.   The server brought 3 side dishes,  but my friend noticed that kimchi was missing, so we asked about it.  She then brought 2 more dishes over, one of which was the kimchi that Korean restaurants are known for.  My pork bone soup arrived, so i eagerly dug in.  The taste was ok.  It was pretty mild compare to other restaurants.  The bones were not as meaty as i have experienced in other places.  For $10.99, i could get the soup elsewhere for cheaper and better tasting."}
{"text":"Ordered the ramen from the menu and they didn't have a spicy indicator nor did they ask what spice level I wanted. Bloody thing was so spicy I couldn't even eat it.  Then they were telling me next time to let them know. I said \"no problem, I just won't eat it\" and I was just going to wait for my colleagues to finish their orders while my tongue was just recovering.  While it was recovering it gave that numbing sensation I usually get with MSG.  Though it's pretty mild so it may be a false positive, but I only had a couple strands of noodles.  After a minute or so they said they'd make me another one and I asked for plain, no-spice.  Too bad my old go-to place Sogong-Dong Tofu House is gone now, though based on the more recent reviews it had gone downhill too.  However, I did recall they asked it explicitly.  Anyway when the ramen arrived it came in some really scalding hot bowl.  Thankfully they provided a small plate that I can transfer to.  I yelled \"ouch\" when a drop of the soup fell on my arm, it was that hot temperature wise.  The ramen noodles are pretty firm considering how hot the soup was, so I was happy about that.  The ramen came with a piece of dumpling and some rice cakes which make it a bit more interesting.  The egg was pre-dropped into the soup so by the time I got to it, it was already hard boiled.  I kind of wished it was put on the side so I can add it in myself and stir it because I kinda like it mixed with the soup base.  The soup base itself was VERY salty.  I drank a bit of water to flush it down.  However, from what I can tell, I didn't detect any MSG related sensations when the soup base was plain so that's a plus.  Not sure how much my colleague tipped, but I would likely not come here again for a while.  I decided to give it a chance as normally I wouldn't eat at any Owl of Minerva locations after my bad experience during my pre-Yelp days."}
{"text":"Minerva only has three stars on Yelp? The nerva!   This brightly lit, slightly dirrrrty dame is my friend. She's always there for me, no matter the hour, and she always feeds me quickly. Her deep fried dumplings, her hot pots, her shockingly good pork fried rice. It's all good.   Do I order her more authentic dishes? No. I'm very confused when it comes to ordering Korean eats, and I've accidentally ended up with some pretty questionable (for my taste buds) pickled squid soups before, so I stick to the Canadian-ized faves. But boy are they faves!   Their dumps are cash only."}
{"text":"Was here again for the hotpot. Hit the spot but that's about it. The Bossam was better before.  The waitress brought us the dish with a mountain of pickled radish, another waitress passed by and said ohh and took it back and returned with a smaller one.  Not impressed with that move. Didn't expect much from the service but my company and I enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Nicest place you can find for Korean fare. They are pretty busy for dinner and even more so on a weeknight. Gotta get in early and be patient.  They have many popular dishes, bulgogi and bipbimbap come to mind. I ordered ramen this time and my friend got spicy stir-fried chicken. They will serve you tea while you wait for the food.  Remember to bring cash, they don't accept credit card for bills under 20 dollars.  It's also open late - so you can get your Korean fix on past midnight."}
{"text":"I don't know about you but I'm too overwhelmed by choice when I'm in koreatown. I don't know where to go or what to have. Or where to even begin. But after some dancing at Clintons, my friend and her hubby were grabbing some grub. I took advantage of their knowledge and joined them. They have been coming to this joint for a while and know their    cuisine. We had some spicy pork, squid and beef short ribs. Plenty of rice and water to tame the spiciness. Now that I've been introduced, I'll have to come back again and try some other dishes. Don't except friendly service. But it's quick, efficient and decent value. Also I think they're open 24hrs. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"We visited Owl on a busy Friday night for some Korean food. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated. Most of the time we were waiting (waited to order, and waited for the food).  He got the bibimbap and I got the pork bone soup. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the pork bone soup. It didn't taste spicy to me which I was glad. There was enough meat for me to get full without eating all the rice. Writing this review has me craving for some more!  Although the service wasn't great at least the food was!"}
{"text":"Poor service, busy, noisy, food was mediocre and SLLLLOOOOWWWW. The entire restaurant was fairy dirty as well. A server also spilt something on me, which they did apologize for, but it was gross and I feel like they should have at least given us a small discount on our meal.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's OWL time!  Not to be mistaken for the other famous OWL logo'd restaurant and bar - though it would probably have been way more fun!  If you've been to one Owl, you've kind of been to them all.  Expect this one is 24 hours of PBS fun!  Yes...Pork Bone Soup, not the television station.  Ahh...PBS.  The single meal that has taken Korean gastronomy to new depths.  Gone are the days that people ask me, hey know any good Korean BBQ places?  Love that Galbi and Pork Belly on the grill!  Now it's all PBS and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and Soju - I soju...do you soju too?  This Owl is located south of Finch on Yonge Street.  Smack in the middle of the K-Strip - Yonge and Sheppard to past Steeles Ave.  Street parking is the best you will get here.  The place is lively and filled with people looking for a cheap fill up and PBS addicts.  Also, late night food vampires are found here in droves as they need to get something to take the alcoholic edge off when then get kicked out of the nearby bars.  The food is basically consistent with the other Owl locations.  I do think that the price is a bit higher here than the ones in the outskirts of town.  Decoration - lack there of - is the same.  Walls plastered in handwritten specials in Korean and English \"sMelling Pistakes.\"   Service is prompt and unfriendly - as expected.  Food comes out at a rapid-fire rate with expectations that you will eat and go at the same furious pace.  I won't be coming back to this location as it is chaotic.  I much prefer ChoSunOk than the Owl anyway but sometimes when in Rome...ho hum.  2.5 stars.  Cheers."}
