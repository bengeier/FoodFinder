{"text":"Pretentious to say the least. I asked for water with my drink and she brings out bottled water, I said i didn't want bottled water just a glass (like any restaurant including any 5 star restaurant would bring). She told me they don't have tap water. Really? You don't have tap water? Makes me think what's wrong with you plumbing and what the hell do make your rice with. And if you're going to act all pretentious at least serve high end water, not cheap nestle bottled water. I lost all interest in this place after that. Their food is nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I've tried almost all Persian restaurants in Toronto and by far Darbar has been the best one! It was my third visit here on Saturday. As usual, my husband and I ordered the Soltani dish to share. The Barg tenderloin veal was juicy and delicious. Kobideh was good as well, specially I like the herbs they mix with the ground meat.  Prices: The prices are higher than all other Persian restaurants by around $10, however, I believe the food quality and the vibe of the restaurant is superior to other Persian places and because of that I don't mind paying $10-$20 extra when I am there.  Portions: I am not sure if I am right but I think their portions have shrunk since the first time I ate there two years ago! Correct me if I am wrong! :)   Will go back maybe in a couple of moths."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricy side but large portions on the main courses  and great quality food and friendly staff.  Great for special occasions ."}
{"text":"very good high quality persian food, it is just a bit pricy, so be prepared for that ;)"}
{"text":"Just amazing! The best Persian food I have ever eaten in my life. The meat was very delicious and juicy. The barg was very soft and melted in your mouth. The kabob was just very juicy and full of taste. The rice also gives a lot of taste with the kabob. The chenje was one of a kind. That had to be the best thing here and I have never had one that was close to this one. BTW: Go to the new location not the old one."}
{"text":"Staff were very friendly. We had a new waitress that was in training so when she had trouble answering some of our questions another woman (possibly the owner) came over to help. She was very willing to give us lots of details about the menu and recommendations and even offered that if my husband didn't like his meal she would switch it.   The three of us are familiar with other forms of middle eastern food but hadn't specifically had persian food recently. Most of the restaurant patrons seemed persian, which is usually a good sign.   I had a grilled chicken dish with rice, the other two had items from the \"stew\" section of the menu. We also had an eggplant appetizer. The appetizer was excellent. My chicken was very juicy and came with a plate of rice. Portion was huge. I guess this is probably typical of persian food but I was disappointed that there were no vegetables or no option to have half the amount of rice and add a salad. I like variety in my food so eating an entire meal of just rice and chicken isn't my style. My husband and friend were satisfied with their meals but definitely weren't raving. Based on the yelp reviews, I thought this would be a place I would be running back to but it wasn't. If you like traditional persian food, I'm guessing based on the other patrons that you will be happy. If you are looking for something unique,  or like a lot of variety in your meal this place probably isn't for you.   Overall, a solid meal but not somewhere I will be rushing back."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner and really enjoyed the food. Had beef kabobs and lamb, along with some salad and yogurt spinach. The portions were very generous and the food was really flavourful. Not sure how long the place has been open but really enjoyed the venue; the staff was attentive and the decor was modern. Would recommend this place for groups as well as a romantic night out."}
{"text":"It was the best iranian restaurant that I have ever seen in Canada.In this restaurant,everything was  good but the price of wine was so expensive. I recommend this restaurant to all the iranian."}
{"text":"It was my first time visit of this Persian restaurant. It is located on restaurants district on Eglinton West and Avenue road area which is a trendy and nice area. Once I entered the place I found it more upscale, spacious and odor free than I imagined.  The host and the waiters were extremely polite and careful. We ordered \"Mirza GHasemi\" for appetizer (a famous Persian appetizer made of smokey egg plant and dried yugurt). It was well smoked and appetizing. For the main course we ordered a Kebob Koobideh and a Kabob Barg and both of them came with the customary mountains of saffron rice. Both Kebobs were delicious, tasteful and flavorful. The meat perfectly spiced, even the tomatoes were good. The host told us that they only use top and bottom sirloin for their Kebobs. The rice was cooked perfectly, but it was served a bit cold. I would loved to see some  \"Tah- Deek\" (crunchy rice chip like shape) with my rice or as a separate house complimentary! Maybe the \"Next time\" !  I am definitely going to put this place in my seamless rotation! This place filled my craving for Persian food for a Monday night!"}
{"text":"Good decor, good food. But honestly, $45 for a soltani is borderline theft, if you ask me! Go to North or some other Persian restaurant which is as good, and save yourself $20. At $45 for a meal, you can get a decent steak at a steakhouse. With apps and a drink, you're paying close to $80 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"I lived in LA for many years and loved eating kebab barg (beef tenderloin); however, when I moved away I was always disappointed...until tonight.  The barg at Darbar was absolutely superb--tender, juicy with just the right amount of seasoning.  The eggplant appetizer was also delicious, as was the ground beef.  The service is top-notch and the atmosphere very pleasant.  I plan on becoming a regular there!"}
{"text":"Excellent food ! The service and ambience was great . The kudidehs (both chicken and beef) were excellent .. I have been to many Persian places in US, And Dubai but this is one of the best so far .. I would highly recommend anyone looking for Persian food .. One of the best thing is that they serve alcohol !! They do have nice collection .."}
{"text":"Great meal, made and served with care and attention. Great environment. Great service. A fabulous experience. Believe all the other 5 star reviews, and check out this place."}
{"text":"The best persian restaurant in Toronto. Amazing food, great service and professional staff allthough the prices is a little bit expensive... overall 4 stars experience"}
{"text":"Excellent service; tasteful and authentic food. Staff are very friendly, polite and professional. Very relax and clean environment."}
{"text":"Great customer service but the food is just average their kabab torsh was horrible the worst I had but their barg and jooje are average.  . and the price is too expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations and the service and the food is very unreliable. The food is so overpriced for the quality and the service they offer I am shocked at how people continue to go there. At times the food s decent but it still doesn't justify the prices which are comparable to upscale steakhouses such as Michael's on Simco and such without the actual quality of food, the ambiance, the wine list or the service. The place (both locations) are poorly designed and decorated and the music is just irrelevant. The kashk o bademjan o two occasions was bitter which is a sign they didn't taste the eggplants (which is a must for anyone who makes that dish) before making it or they knew it was bad and they made it anyways. The koobideh was stale and smelled, and the meat in the baghali polo tasted and looked like it was from days ago."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Persian restaurant in Toronto. Everything is perfect here from food to service and atmosphere. If you like to treat yourself to a high quality meal this can be an excellent option. If you're not Persian and it's the first time having Persian food go for Barg and you wouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going to darbar for a year now and every time i go i have a good time. The food is a bit pricy but worth it. Its dim and dark at night time."}
{"text":"The food and service at Darbar have been consistently superb. I've been here around ten times and have always been impressed by their hospitality and the quality of their food. If you're into succulent Kebobs, then you don't have to look any further."}
{"text":"The food was really bad! It was too expensive!! 180 for 2 people. Not worth it. Also the customer service was awful"}
{"text":"This is such a welcome to the Eglinton West restaurant scene. The servers are very patient. They explained all the menu items. The servings are generous. We had three apps: Persian salad, BBQ eggplant with yogurt and fried onions, and the stuffed grape leaves. All extremely fresh and flavorful. My favourites were the grape leaves and the eggplant. For mains everyone had various meats with rice and roasted tomatoes. The waitress recommended the veal which others really liked. I had their signature dish of  lamb chops, shishlik I think. It was cooked perfectly. Most of the clientele seemed to be Iranian which says it all about the food. When I return I think I would make a meal of the appetizers. They were so interesting I found it hard to choose. Reservations needed on weekends."}
{"text":"No reservations.  Prepare to wait if you show up.   Place looks like a bar that is now decorated for fine dining but can't quite make it. So it's half trying to be fine dining but really it's -at best- a lounge.   Good date place and good for family if you don't mind waiting.   Try the Baghali Polo & beef Koobideh (OMG! SO YUM!) don't order the white fish - it's horribly dry. the lamb shank is excellent.  Sabzi Kookoo -  A cutlet made of spinach, dill and cilantro is good but nothing to get excited about.  The Persian tea is yummy but not like the regular chai. Try the baklava - they make it in house and it's much softer.   I heavily dislike the bathroom and it's always questionable when a restaurant does not invest in the bathroom.   The prices tend to be a bit on the high side so be prepared. Considering there's much better places, I wouldn't come back here.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"A little on the higher end side, but completely worth it! Beautiful, intimate restaurant but not crowded at all. Food is delicious and service is great. However, I would not recommend the dessert - the saffron pastry was too sweet and not very good, and two small scoops of saffron ice cream costed 10$. Overall, I would go again."}
{"text":"friendly staff, best Barg (tenderloin) kabob in town, best yogurt drink, very delicious ground beef kabob. would definitely go there for Persian food."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and stopped by  darband to get some food.... It was clean and nice... Also staff were really friendly Kale pacheh was really good Ash was really good too"}
{"text":"This is a classy restaurant with delicious Persian food. The décor is beautiful. There is a nice wine lounge and the servers are polite and helpful. This restaurant also has a calm and relaxing atmosphere. I recommend their chicken Sultani kebab which comes with chicken fillet and chicken koobideh. Their kebab Torsh is also very juicy, tender, and flavourful. The barberries that you can add to your rice are very tasty as well."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Darbar restaurant. Went there for lunch few days ago for the first time. We were greeted and welcomed. Then I asked for some water but was brought bottle water and was told that \"the tap water was not healthy due to construction\"! Really?! That was the weirdest thing I had ever heard!  We were brought some bread which was not very impressive compared to North restaurant or Gilaneh restaurant that bring hot freshly made delicious bread! Then looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed was the high prices, which I think was the highest I had ever seen in a Persian restaurant. Looks like the prices have gone up about 1.5 times since it was opened 2 years ago, based on the menu I found online. To be fair, the portion was big and 2 people with average appetite can share it. I had Soltani kebab and the quality was very good. I just think that at least for lunch the prices need to be more reasonable. They could make the portions less I guess and bring the price down too. Overall I am happy I tried it but don't think I will go there too often."}
{"text":"I don't know about the food because we were not welcomed here. Today at noon we were walking by and saw the open sign on the door. My wife and I walked in and said hi. Two staff members were talking to each other. They saw us but they did not respond. I said Hello!. Again they looked at us and kept talking to each other. We ended up walking out the restaurant. The food might be good but I am sure the service will not be friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I treated a small group of family here for a special event and spent well over $400 for dinner. My 19 month old daughter was also present.  First - just for any parents of young children planning to dine here: It's incorrect to say this is a family-friendly restaurant or 'good for kids' when basic amenities like a change table are not available. Having high chairs isn't enough to warrant that claim. I was forced to change my daughter in our car across the street in 0 degree weather.  The ambiance is ok, I guess, for a Persian restaurant attempting to stand out from other take-out ethnic restaurants in the GTA. Our waitress was polite and well-informed, although she was only really attentive when she was trying to get us to buy the overly-expensive group platters and then seemed to disappear when I was trying to figure out why we had all ordered promptly yet waited over 45 minutes for our meals. It was busy, granted, so we didn't say anything, but there were people (with five to six people in their parties as well) that came after us, were seated, and got their appetizers AND entrees before us.   The food was not bad, as far as Persian food goes, I guess. Just dump a lot of butter on the rice and kebabs and you're good to go. I was surprised  a bit by the things we got charged for - for example, flat water that was part of the table. What high-end restaurant charges customers for flat water? It was misleading and I feel like for a place where we were clearly going to spend so much money, it makes it seem sort of cheap and off-putting.  From my seat at my table, I also noticed a tupperware container sitting on a shelf near the kitchen entrance filled with what looked like boiled hot dogs the entire night. Totally random - but why was there a container full of hot dogs out there the whole time? LOL It just confused me. Staff continuously went back and forth from the kitchen and the bar area with more Dollar Store tupperware filled with sliced salad ingredients...again, just looks off and such a stark contrast against the classy feel they are clearly aiming for.  I think this is one of those unjustifiably expensive ethnic restaurants that is not worth the hype. If you're not familiar with Persian/Iranian food and don't mind long wait times, maybe you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, skip this wannabe pretentious stuff and just find a good Afghan kebab place where your belly will tell you how worth it was."}
{"text":"Easily the best Persian food I've had in Toronto.  I came here for a special occasion and I was not disappointed.  The interior has a more upscale steakhouse feel to it than the other Persian places, and the service was attentive.  We had the Kashkeh Bademjan, an eggplant dip to start with some flat bread.  The layers of ingredients were layered into the bowl and you could taste all the flavours in there as you dip.  Next up is the Fesenjan, a pomegranate and walnut chicken stew, with chicken that was fork tender and a sauce with a nutty flavour that went well with the Persian rice.  Finally the Kabab Torsh was expertly grilled.  The slices of veal were very tender and topped with a pomegranate sauce with a side of grilled tomatoes, jalapeño peppers, and a pomegranate sauce.  The sauce bordered on sweet, but the meatiness of the veal complemented it well.  Will definitely make this my recommendation for Persian any day."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom, sister and friend; I really have nothing bad to say about this place, which is odd as I always do.  It's a great date night restaurant; as well as, a family place. The atmosphere was very warm welcoming, the service was amazing, everyone (including the owner) were very attentive and made sure we were always happy. The food was very fresh and cooked to perfection.  I would go here again and again and definitely recommend anyone craving hearty Persian food to go here. What I liked most is the proximity to downtown; I don't have to travel over an hour for great Persian food, this was better than most Persian restaurants in Richmond Hill.  This is a must go!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place several weeks ago and had already gone there 4 times.  The fesenjan and the chicken breast are out of this world.   The flavours are just spectacular!  The persian tea is the best I've had in Toronto and the mint tea is made with real mint -- which I always appreciate.   The service is always great and the atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect -- it's quiet, twilighty and romantic which to us is important -- I like to be able to hear my companion when I go out to dinner."}
{"text":"For sure it does not worth it. It is not just the expensive menu! You can choose to eat or not but the thing is you should keep this on mind they screw the bill by adding nonsense items which is not regular at Persian restaurants. Even once does not worth it to try. Trust me.  They charged for a free item in all Persian restaurant \"Tahdig\" $23 (everywhere this is free) !! And they charged extra $8 to exchange the rice type which is not an option!!!"}
{"text":"The best Kabab Barg I've ever had in Canada.  The best service, polite staff, cozy place. I'll recommend you this place."}
{"text":"It's like going over to you Persian aunt house for dinner.  Family run, excellent service.  Try the stews!  Somehow the prices went up, still good but pricey."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of five for a friend's birthday on Saturday. We had reservations for 5:30pm to 7:30pm, the only time slot available due to a week's advance booking. Once we've got there, I understand why? It's a small restaurant with about 20 tables' tops, meaning very limited tables for large groups.  So make reservations!  I've had Middle East cuisine before at pot lucks and small take out shops. Never in a restaurant, if you count \"The Sultan's Tent & Café Moroc\" and \"BerBer Resto Bar Lounge.\"  The ambiance was surprisingly delightful because it wasn't your usual mom and pop shop; it was upscale and modern with nice touch to details (china, place mats, decoration, and lighting) A place to bring newbies to experience Persian cuisine, great for dates.  The Service was gracious and attentive since most of us have not had Persian cuisine, being an Asian group of girls it was obvious that we didn't know what to order. Our server was happy to explain and elaborate the items on the menu. He provided lots of suggestions around what our group liked to eat and recommend what type of appetizer, entrée, and salads will pair well together.  The amount was generous and great for sharing; we ordered 4 entrees and 3 appetizers.  For appetizers we've ordered 2 Mirza Ghasemi (smoked roasted eggplant, tomatoes, eggs, and garlic) and Stuffed Grape Leaves (similar to Greek Dolmades) as appetizers. The eggplant was creamy and dressed with finely chopped mint and shreds of caramelized onion with smoky flavour/taste. The grape leaf was warm and tasty (I don't normally like Greek Dolmades, but this was delicious) because it was doused with honey and lemon juice that gave them a little sweetness. They also provided complementary pita, honeyed walnuts, feta looking cheese, and fresh parsley and mint on the table.  For our entree we've ordered the Sultani Kabob Combo (Persian style barbecued lamb, chicken or beef), Shishlik Kabob (all meat, all fat, or alternating pieces of meat, fat, and vegetables such as bell pepper, onion, mushroom and tomato), Chicken Leg Kebob, and Fensenjan Stew (pomegranate juice and ground walnuts) The kabobs was moist and nicely spiced to my liking, nothing like the ones you get a Mr Greek or Friendly Greek. You can taste the spices, especially saffron and lime. The kebobs came with 5 half cut roasted tomatoes. The roasted meats definitely made my day! As for Fensenjan stew, it wasn't your typical western stew. I couldn't tell if there was meat in the stew because there was nothing visible to the eye (not sure if it was blended but it was lumpy and possibly some kind of ground meat) We had mini lamb chops (think it was part of the combo) and it was cooked exactly to medium rare, didn't have the nasty lamb smell. With the entrees, we all had a generous plate full of basmati rice with saffron (fluffy and airy) which complemented the meat and stew wonderfully.  For beverages, they had a great selection of wine however no beer on tap. Just bottles, didn't bother me that much. I ordered Organic Mill Street beer. Would've preferred a bottle of wine but my friends don't drink.  To end dinner, we brought homemade/decorated cupcakes for our friends' birthday; they were generous with keeping it aside for us. We ordered Persian tea (black tea with cardamom and saffron) to complement the cupcakes which was a perfect match, didn't even need milk or sugar. But if you're a tea drinker, you don't need anything in the tea. I was stunned on how good it was as a combo with black tea, cardamom, and saffron.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience and food. The service was impeccable; our waiter was attentive and informative. The bill came to $146.90 which was reasonable. I would defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"Really good place for the food but what i loved was the service. I was waiting on my friends to arrive so I was sitting at the table all by myself. The waiter brought me over tea while I was waiting (on the house~~~)! So Persian! That little act made me so happy i really enjoyed the food"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when we were looking for a different restaurant in the avenue/yonge/eg area.  I should add this is my first time trying Persian food.  Rolled in an hour before close and they were happy to serve us.  This place deserves the high ratings.  Service is amazing.  I believe this is a family run shop, but our waitress was very helpful in explaining the menu, knowing it was our first time, and extremely courteous.  I was recommended the barg by a friend and it did not disappoint.  You get a giant bed of basmati rice (which I inhaled) and the biggest slab of veal I have ever seen.  The meat was super tender.  My girlfriend had the fesjani (sp?) and it was good too.  I'll admit it was a new flavour for us; think of a sweet chicken stew, but typically I'm pretty adventurous and enjoyed it.  I also recommend the grape leaves appetizer.  I'd come here again.  It's also reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  I also tricked my mind in telling myself that I worked out, so eating a huge slab of protein is good for me."}
{"text":"If you want lots of grilled meat and rice, this is a good place for you. Meat was juicy and good. If you like a bit more variety, and vegetables, in your meal, this is not the place for you. They were sold out of grilled vegetables when we arrived for dinner at 6 pm.  As a restaurant, how do you run out of veg? They were also sold out of whitefish. Left with the option of a heavy looking bean stew on a hot night I ordered chicken kebab and a salad. The salad was tiny and boring. Chicken moist, but nothing interesting going on flavour wise. This place is not cheap, for the same price you can get amazing middle eastern food done creatively at Byblos."}
{"text":"It's a nice and clean place. The food quality is good, but not perfect. Price-wise, it's almost about every higher-than-average Iranian restaurant; maybe a tad higher. The ambient was good. Waiters care about the customers, but they care way too much. I mean it would be nice if they came to our table few times to ask if we needed anything, but going back and forth to the table every few minutes and commenting about every single thing was a bit annoying. It got to the point that I totally felt like they were faking attention in order to get higher tip, which was really annoying. That's why I'm giving them 4 *'s. I will go back again but I hope to see a more natural attitude and more dignity."}
{"text":"We used to go to this place a lot for a descent Persian food, but the quality didn't keep up with the prices, so we decided not to bother any more. The food was of highest quality and also the most expensive in Toronto, but the quality kept getting worse. Another thing, the last time we dined in, the staff recommended the appetizer platter (which was not on the menu) and charged us 50 bucks for it. Seriously !?"}
{"text":"Restaurant has nice setup as fine restaurant with low profile service.Today I had a chance to visit it. Well, they have to update their address on yelp ! Which is at:  2015 Avenue Rd, North York    Their Welcoming service for 2 families was ok as they picked immediately high chairs for the little ones. However, after we seated; we waited for menu's for more than 10 min.   There were nice 2 small plates of cheese and walnuts with bread baskets no one asked to refill.  Strangely and all of sudden we received big plates where all orders was in !!!! We asked politely to reserve it separately again. They reserve it in 2 sec .    We had vegetable soup was nice and tasty enough for 2. Skewers size was good . We had kupaidah, chicken, Sultani and especial DarBar skewers. All were amazingly tasted very good and grilled in very highly professional way. Plates comes with nice basmati rice with saffron, grilled tomatoes and grilled jalapeños. chicken and pomegranate stew not really recommended!   At checkout no one asked to try their dessert menu or to come again as fine restaurant expected good bye greeting. Which make their price more inconvenient.   Darbar Restaurant in all and Washrooms was cleaned.   Maybe will give it another chance for the taste? Not in near future!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Very good food and very good service...I'm Persian and i can compare Darbar to Tehran restaurants"}
{"text":"Ghormesabzi & Tadig to die for...excellent atmosphere and courteous staff...a bit pricy but worth every penny for the quality of the food you get. Depending on the time you go there parking maybe an issue"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! unfortunately the service is ok. been there 4 times, our bills were mixed up 3 times! Once they totally forgot to bring our drink (Dough)!"}
{"text":"When they say location is key, they knew what they were talking about! Darbar adds to the diversity of the many independent style eateries that line Avenue Rd. The venue is formally decorated from the minute you enter to the tables filled with the \"tools\" needed to enjoy your meal. Shucks they even have a fireplace, in the TV screen though! The menu is filled with authentic Persian cuisine and the prices tend to be on the high side, but portions are large and are all accompanied with mounds of rice. The quality is above par when comparing to local, low budget places and the leftovers I ate the next day tasted even better.  Our party of three ordered a mix platter of various meets including kobehdi (spelling?) , chicken and a tender fillet of beef. All were amazing! We also tried a pomegranate skewered beef dish but it was highly sauced and not my favorite. Plenty of naan style bread and dips added to a great meal. Alcohol is offered and prices were reasonable for drinks. We couldn't do dessert as we were all full but managed to enjoy a delicious cup of persian tea to end the night! I'll be back when I feel like spending like a persian prince! Total for the evening about $225."}
{"text":"One on the best Persian restaurants in Toronto! I always craved the homemade stews my friend's mom use to make at their house and was never able to find a place that could replicate that taste until now. It's pretty easy to find a place that makes a decent kebab but stews are another story. We ordered the ghormeh sabzi , fesenjan and the white fish between two people. Everything was so flavourful and delicious! The service was also very impressive. Super attentive and they really try to cater to you. I would definitely come here again and again!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Persian food and this place certainly delivers the best I've ever tried.    The place is so elegantly decorated without being too much.   Staff are really nice and attentive.    Food overall is delicious and so flavourful.. so many different things put together are so inspiring to my palate I can't wait to go again!  Had the Darbar kabob with rice and some appetizer plate to start.  Worth going back for for sure."}
{"text":"I have to catch up on a few reviews for places I have recently enjoyed...  I had been looking for a good Persian place to try fesenjan, and I was in the Yonge/Eglinton neighbourhood recently, so I walked over to where I had seen Darbar Persian Grill from the bus a few times. The restaurant had a warm feel inside, a little up-scale, the lights were low and some quiet music was playing.  The appetizer was greens with walnut and feta cheese, and there was also pita bread. That was all fine. Bottled water for $1 is a current trend that I do not care for, but it seems to be everywhere nowadays. The fesenjan (walnut and pomegranate stew with chicken) was excellent, and it came with a plate of saffron rice. Overall very tasty, the chicken was well-cooked, the rice was neither sticky nor stiff but just right for my taste. I finished with a glass of Persian tea. Total bill was about $30.  The servers were very pleasant; although the service seemed a little slow at the time, I will assume that they were taking their time to make everyone's meal from fresh. Overall, I very much enjoyed my visit, and will have to return at some time to try their kabobs."}
{"text":"My favorite Persian restaurant in Toronto and believe me the best in Toronto!  I tried the old place once couple of years ago but it was a disaster! (Read my prior post). I am happy to say not only they moved to a new place on Avenue Rd but they went through massive change for good!  The new management has made all the difference and are amazing!  I have been to Darbar few times since they moved both with Persian and Non- Persian friends and it never disappoints! The staff are super pleasant, attending to you and respectful. The interior has gone under significant change with lots of room and nice interior design.  There is paid parking available.  The appetizers are amazing. I would suggest the platter if you are going with a party of 4 or more otherwise try the Kashk-o-bademjan. I like the kebabs, especially the Sultani. Not a big fan of kebab torsh but heard good things about it. Baghli Polo Mahicheh is amazing.  So to give a short update and summarize, I would suggest Darbar 100%. The only draw back I should admit is Darbar is on the pricier side of most Persian restaurant but have to admit the quality of food worths it."}
{"text":"We stopped there after a family photoshoot. My husband had heard good reviews from coworkers. Not only they had a friendly and fast service, the food was out of this world. One of the best persian food I have tasted in my life even though I have  been in many persian restaurants in GTA. We were impresed with portion sizes, taste, and quality of the service. Perfect place to invite friends for fancy dinner or a date night. I highyly recommend Darbar to all my persian friends."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Nice staff. Very friendly and professional. The food was really good and in big portions. So if it looks pricy the portions made up for it.  At the end the Iranian deserts (saffron ice cream, falloode, tea and persian sweets) were really delicious. The only little negative point was that some of the foods were a bit salty.  Overall if you want to take foreigners to a place to taste persian food I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not bad, definitely overpriced compared to other persian kebob places around the city. Food is good, but nothing outstanding. Decor is nice, and staff is friendly. They shouldn't bother serving alcohol. They market themselves as an grill/bar, but served me a dead warm beer, and my girl a dead warm glass of Pinot grigio. They have several beer taps, but only for show, they don't work. Clearly, they have no clue what they're doing in the bar space, so they should concentrate on Making the food more remarkable."}
{"text":"Decor - the place was very clean and well put together, however, the dark lighting coupled with the music choice resulted in my partner and I almost falling asleep before the meal came.  Food - We both had the rice and chicken breast kebab plate.  The rice was devoid of any flavour and the chicken was fairly greasy but at least it had some taste to it.  Service - very friendly and helpful.  The woman serving us was very helpful.  Price - paid about $60 for two kebab plates.  Much more expensive than typical Persian restaurants but unfortunately the food tasted worse than the grease joints north of yonge and finch"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my friend.  We were totally impressed at the food & service. This place doesn't really look like something special from the outside, but wow - inside is so nice.  Perfect for friends or a date!  The staff are super friendly and our waitress was so nice.  She explained the menu in a non condescending way and explained the dishes beautifully.  I had the Kebab Torsch and it was divine!  The meat was super tender and flavourful.  I had leftovers and when they packed it, they gave me fresh rice!  Who does that - gives you more food at the end and not charge you?!   the tea at the end complimented the meal so well.  I will be back soon for sure.  This is an amazing find!"}
{"text":"Amazing Persian food. However, the high cost is not justified. It is super expensive. They charge $10 for yogurt and almost $50 for the Soltani dish. However, the food and service are exceptional."}
{"text":"We were very impressed.   The decor was modern and welcoming.   The service was incredible, they gave us a plate of walnuts, cheese, butter, and fresh herbs together with bread before we even looked at the menus. They gave us a plate of extra tomatoes when we asked for one and when they packed up out leftover kabab, they added rice so we'd have something to eat it with later.  The food was amazing, the dough was thick and incredible and the portions were large.  Overall we were very happy with our dinner choice."}
{"text":"Decor is very nice here. Very beautiful.  Food is expensive and taste like other Persian places I know.  Would probably go to a least expensive place next time I am craving Persian food. However, this place is good for a celebration because it's beautiful.  Pita is thin and I prefer the thick ones.   Meat isn't bad. Flavourful.   I didn't like the eggplant we ordered, but this is due to the dish itself and not how it was made."}
{"text":"Beautiful decoration, good food and welcoming servers but a bit pricey. I will go there again if Im in that area and craving persian food!"}
{"text":"One of the best Persian food restaurants you can find outside Iran. Restaurant is very clean. Staff are nice. Quality and taste of the food is very good. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good kebabs, good welcoming folks and great quality rice. The closest you can get to Iranian food in Toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best Persian restaurants I have ever tried.  It's the place that you want to take your non-Persian friends and show them a great restaurant with amazing food and fantastic customer service. We ordered different dishes, tahdig with stew, Koobideh kebab, chicken breast kebab, and Barg kebab as well as different yogurts, with cucumber, and with egg plant; everything we tried was tasty, fresh and with a very good quality. Our server was fantastic and really caring. I will definitely recommend this restaurant and will go back if in Toronto area."}
{"text":"The kabobs are nicely done.  I had the combo of beef and chicken.  Variety is always good!  The vegetable platter has a nice mix of grilled veggies. I especially liked the  hot pepper. Good heat - not overpowering.    Servings are large. Justifies the price.   Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Nice conversation with them if the place is not super busy.   Wine choices are good and decently priced.  All in all an excellent experience.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The service is beyond amazing. I had to say that first since that's probably the only good thing about this restaurant. the servers are very nice and friendly but the food is definitely overpriced. I'm a real foodie and I just know what I'm eating and the food here is double what it's worth. it's good like all other Persian restaurants. nothing really special and if you've been to others you'll just know. the prices are silly and I feel stupid every time I go there since I think the owners just laughing at everyone's face with the prices. I do not recommend this place at all and they only reason it's still open is that Persians love to pretend and this place is just filled with pretentious people."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! I had the Beef Kebob, which was done about right. Not too uncooked, not over-cooked. They really know what they are doing..."}
{"text":"In town from Philly and couldn't wait to try a nearby Persian restaurant - Not many down south.  How lucky was I to be near Darbar.  The restaurant for a Sunday evening at 9 had a number of tables occupied.  I was having dinner on my own and I was seated quickly in a wonderful location.  The service was exceptional and the food was even better!  I knew I wanted lamb for my entree and of course eggplant and yogurt as an appetizer.  Everything was wonderful and the lamb shank melted in my mouth.    Chatting with the server after dinner I mentioned that it had been a while since I had found a really good Persian restaurant.  When I mentioned Philadelphia he immediately agreed as his uncle lives there and can't find anything close to Darbar.  Server even mentioned that their other location also has a patio - I have 4 more nights, who knows?!"}
{"text":"Excellent Persian grill.  Ordered the chicken breast and mint tea.    The rice is light and fluffy, the chicken breast juicy and succulent.  They offer two charbroiled plum tomatoes for your rice.   Servers are extremely friendly and attentive.  Great for the whole family or a date."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, family operated, and the service is outstanding. The dishes are too die for. It's highly recommended in my books. Try the appetizer platter, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was definitely not worth $150 for two.  We sat by the door in an empty resturant and they claimed all the tables are booked for the night!"}
{"text":"This a trendy sit down restaurant with nice quiet atmosphere and great attentive service. Very fresh high quality food. Entrees are $15-30  but average is $20. Appetizers about $5-10. This was a great surprise. Everything was great. Will be back for sure and will recommend friends i I am usually very critical when it comes to restaurants. This one passed my test with flying colors!"}
{"text":"Best persian food in Ontario Such a nice team and great ambient Ask for Juicy Barg Kabab"}
{"text":"My friend and I had kabab torsh here last week. The food was amazing and the portion was enough to share between 2 people. We also had Kashke bademjoon as appetizer. It was also delicious. The setting of the restaurant is a bit classy and formal. It's a little pricey compared to other Persian restaurants. And their service could have been better. Overall, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love me a good Persian grill. To be honest I can't remember which kebabs we ordered. I had too much wine.  Just remembered that they tasted amazing. Be sure to ask them to keep the kebabs moist and they won't cook it as well done. Also,  sprinkle on some sumac (available at the table) for added flavour.   I was so full afterwards I could have been rolled home!"}
{"text":"They were very manipulative and literally ripped us off. Don't go there because the price is absolutely not worth the food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, ultra courteous and professional staff !  You don't have to be a Persian to dine here, you'll simply gonna love it !  Their Barg ( fillet ) Kebab is arguably one of the best I've had anywhere in the World!  And I travel to many places and eat at many different fine venues !  They have my full seal of approval !"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite persian food place, but I am sure yesterday was my last visit. They have changed their prices and each item in the menu is really overpriced now. The waiting for food was longer than usual even though it was not busy. Our server never came back to our table to check if everything was ok, if she would she knew that one of our orders got forgotten and we never got that item. Also, you better know that this place doesn't serve tap water. They say city has banned them from serving tap water, so you need to either order bottled water or have other drinks. Over all we paid too much for a good food/ long waiting time/ average service."}
{"text":"The food is definitely a 5 star, (I only give it a 3 star because of my past 0star experience there). best Persian rice I've ever had, the kabab was tender and juicy and didn't smell like old meet, $35 for a beef kabab is definitely pricy but since I really enjoyed it, I won't complain. Rice itself was $8, again overprice. The kashke bademjan wasn't good, it was toooo oily and flavorless. The service wa excellent. We had the best server that night, but to my surprise, she insisted on not talking farsi, which seems odd in an Iranian food establishment with majority of customers being Persian. The ambiance is not like your typical kabab house, it's nice though... my first visit to Darbar was years ago when they just opened up. Back then I loved the food and ask the owner's daughter about the brand. She got so pissed and told me that she would never tell me what rice brand they use because it's their \"trade secret\" and that she had put on 5 kg, finding this secret rice! Other kabab places never hesitate telling you what rice brand they use. It was so odd! Since the , although I lived close by and we eat kabab every week, I didn't go back to Darbar. Tonight, I was kinda dragged there and I'm happy that I gave it a try because the food was just awesome! The best Persian kabab. But I chose to go back to other kabab houses where they are friendlier and are not scared to tell their customers what rice brand they use!! The food is 5 star, the owner's daughter's attitude is a 0 star  I ordered one main course and one appetizer, and a glass of wine. My friend only had the wine and the total was over $100. Quite pricy for only one dish, without even knowing what type of rice you've been served! Lol"}
{"text":"Good tasty food, i had the vaziri (one skewer of lamb and koobideh). I think overall it is a little overpriced. But to be fair one skewer really serves 1.5 people, servers are very nice and polite too. Must try if you like persian food"}
{"text":"Short review: totally unacceptable experience! Long review: 1- over priced menus 2- inability to serve a large group of people who booked one week in advanced.  3- unprofessional attitudes; requesting minimum order for each person  4- could not manage each and everyone food service.  5- over 90 minutes to bring the main dish."}
{"text":"Took an out of town buddy here,  he liked it so much he  went back the next day.   Case Closed!    If they try to be bit more friendlier they  easily a 5 star in my opinion"}
{"text":"I live in Michigan and every time I visit Toronto, I make sure to stop by here. The food tastes like authentic Iranian food, something that is not easy to find in North America. Such food quality is a win even in Iran. Stews, Kababs, and lamb shank are great. The place is neat and classy. Staff may at times be slow, but when you ask for their help they will be available."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a low rating to fellow Persian restaurant, but my last visit was a total disappointment!   Last weekend, my parents and I had a random craving for Persian kabob, and the closest place to us that was open at the time (it was near 8 o'clock pm), was Darbar. I checked out the reviews on Yelp, and was so pleased to see such high ratings. I gave the OK on the restaurant, put the directions on my GPS, and off we were to feast on some yummy Persian food!  We entered the beautifully decorated, and dim-litted restaurant, and were made to wait for about 20 mins. No problem! I'd gladly wait an extra 20 mins for some good Persian kabob, but my parents and I definately regretted the wait after the dinner.   We were seated at a table near the back of the restaurant, and our kind waiter named Dana greeted us with the menus, and lit the candles on our tables. Such a romantic atmosphere!   We looked at our menus, and decided on getting an appetizer to share, which was the Ghormeh Sabzi on Tadig (herb stew with chunks of stew meat and red kidney beans, over crispy bread and rice from the bottom of the pot). This was such an odd concept for us, because Ghormeh Sabzi is typically served over rice, and Tadig is accompanied on the side as a well-loved treat. So, definately had to try it out.   We also placed our orders for our entrees at the same time.  I had requested the Vaziri kabob dish, which consists of a skewer of Jooje kabob (chicken kabob), and a skewer of Koobide kabob (ground meat kabob), with rice. I had initially asked if I could swap the rice for salad, as I'm trying to cut down on carbs, but that could not be done for some reason. So, I settled for the delicious saffron rice.  My parents both ordered the Soltani dish, which included a skewer of Koobide kabob, and a skewer of Barg kabob (steak kabob). We had also ordered a pitcher of Doogh which is a herbed yoghurt drink.   During our long wait, we slowly filled ourselves up with the provided bread, feta cheese, walnuts, parsley, and raddishes (a typical Persian spread) which was arranged on the table. Our doogh and appetizer finally arrived, along with the entree meals.  The appetizer was not brought to us before the entree dishes, which was unnerving! The timing is very important for customers who place orders for appetizers, because they expect to munch on them BEFORE recieving their main entrees.   Well, c'est la vie, and everyone makes mistakes! So we decided to try out some of the appetizer before digging into our main dishes.   It was as you expect ghorme sabzi to look like over tadig, but boy oh boy was it delicious! The ghorme sabzi was full of flavour, the meat was so tender and juicy, and the tadig was crispy and buttery in flavour. If I could rate the appetizer alone, it would receive a 10/10 from me! But unfortunately, you judge a Persian kabob restaurant for its kabobs, not the appetizer.  We set the appetizer aside, exchanged different pieces of kabobs, and dug into our kabobs.   The first thing I noticed from the kabobs were that they were too salty! All of them had a salt over-load, and it was even noticeable to my mom, who is a salt-fiend! The koobide kabob lacked in overall flavour, while the jooje kabob looked like it had a great saffron marinade on it by the rich colour, but was just OK in taste. Such a let-down!  Although, the barg was overly salty as well, it had a really faint but pleasant, onion taste to it. The buttery saffron rice was also nice, and cooked to perfection. I commend the chef for their good rice-cooking skills!  The saltiness of the food made us very thirsty, so we poured doogh for eachother to drink.  The doogh was essentially just yoghurt with herbs. There was a lack of carbonated water/water in the yoghurt to make it more liquidy in texture, like a typical doogh drink. So, I requested for some water.  Dana had brought out a plastic bottle of water, poured some in separate cups, and left the rest of the small bottle on the table. It was unusual to witness that, but we immediately poured the water into our other cups.  The portions were big, but the taste was lacking. At the end of the meal, we got charged over $200(including the water), for a super long wait, and some really salty kabobs.  I wouldn't recommend this place to non-rich people,  who don't enjoy salty foods.   Though, I may consider going back for the delicious appetizer (the only good thing on the menu that we had tried)."}
{"text":"The Persian food here is phenomenal! Ever since we found out about this place from our friends who live in the area, we have been coming every time we are in town. After having been to many Persian restaurants that are hit or miss, it nice to find a place that consistently serves quality food. The service is exceptional and the ambience is warm and relaxing. I am deducting 1 star because the cups of chai were the smallest I have ever seen for $4 and on our last visit we sat in the back for the first time where the tables were way too close together/claustrophobic."}
{"text":"This is the best Persian restaurant for a date night. I came here for a second time. There were 2 birthday parties here and they played Persian happy birthday songs. The service was as amazing as my first visit. The staff was very well mannered and attentive. I love the decor and the food is simply delicious. I tried the Kabab Torsh and Kashke Bademjan. The kabab torsh is very different from other Persian restaurants. It doesn't have that walnutty taste, instead it's simply marinated in plain sour pomegranate sauce. They make their own yogurt drink with walnut powder and it's quite thick and very delicious.  What they can improve on: The feta cheese amount for the complimentary appetizer was too little for two people. Also, their bathroom needs more attention in terms of looks and decor. I'm not trying to sound cheap but they charge $1 if you ask for water. Isn't that supposed to be complimentary everywhere?"}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best persian foods you can in Toronto. however, we noticed extra salt with the meat so if you are careful about your salt intake I would avoid the restaurant. Pricier than most persian restaurant and disappointed with no live traditional musics. I am sure the environment would benefit from live music. Also the seating area is cramp due to high demand. Overall a friendly team of survants."}
{"text":"Good food, the service was amazing.  Zohreh (our waitress) was great."}
{"text":"It's a new Persian restaurant and a good one .  I loved the decor and the vibe . The staff were really polite and friendly and the food was great .  We had the Soltani Kebab and the Chicken Kebab with the eggplant dish. Kebab was juicy and tasted wonderful .  The food is more expensive than other Persian restaurants and  small portions too and that is my only complaint ."}
