{"text":"Great environment and delicious food. It's not a place you come to in order to get stuffed, the portions are well sized. The food is delicious and flavourful. Try anything on the menu and you'll be impressed.  The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I had some food and wine there with my friend last week. It was a special night so we decided to splurge and go trendy. The room was almost empty when I arrived but the maitre d' squished us in a corner behind the cash register and was very curt. The assistant maitre d' looked a little sheepish - I am not sure why. But the evening started with kind of a weird vibe.  We had: Arugula salad - Tasty. Good for 2. Seared Scallops - Very nice. Cooked perfectly. A little sweet for me but I can recommend these. But $17 for 4 - OUCH! Grilled Prawns - Yum! The usual but a very good version. Again, cooked perfectly. Risotto - Lovely flavour. The rice was sort of long grain and cooked a little al dente. i like the softer version of risotto better. It was okay but I would not order it again. Rapini -Yummy and quite a healthy portion. You can fill up on rapini at $5 a plate :)  We had some cheese and crackers. The cheese was nice but the portion size made us giggle. And the crackers were icky.  We liked the food but our waiter was OBNOXIOUS! He kept trying to make us order stuff we did not want and schooling us in an intrusive manner. After our bill hit $130, he just brought it over unasked with no offer of dessert, coffee, more liquor... so we paid up, finished our wine at a leisurely pace, and headed north to the Black Skirt where we were given the usual warm welcome and served coffee, delicious dessert and lovely liqueurs.   I am glad I tried it out but doubt I'll go back to Salt.   The Black Skirt OTOH remains an often-visited favourite.  PS - the in house prices are higher than the ones posted on the internet menu."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for dinner on a Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed the food, wine and ambience.  We started with a bottle of Duoro Tons, which hit the spot for my friend who wanted a lighter red, yet still tasted of stronger berry flavours.  As for the food: - Cheese plate: although at first glance I was unimpressed with the portion size, when we started eating I was pleasantly surprised with the cheeses and crackers served with it. This cheese plate doesn't compare to that of Black Hoof however, as the accompaniments are tiny and consist mainly of pickled veg.  - Charcuterie plate: Again, I've had plates with more variety so while I enjoyed this dish, I enjoy charcuterie of any and all kinds, therefore it was good but by no means mind blowing.  - Seared Sea Scallops w/sugar snap peas and brown butter vinaigrette - the best dish of the night!! The crispy maple bacon adds a great saltiness to the dish, the scallops are cooked perectly and finished with the vinaigrette that we were scraping onto our dishes to get more of!!   - Carpaccio of Ahi Tuna, mango, chili lime vinaigrette - this was enjoyable, howevere the portion size was smaller than preferred (5 small round thin slices) and I would have preferred a more interesting sauce than your typical chili lime.   - Baguette - Yes, we wanted bread.....fresh delicious, however paired with a tomato marmalade that was far too acidic.   Overall, we really our time here. Just a few small misses on some of the plates....but great ambience, service was good and pretty good value for the money."}
{"text":"The server asked us \"How'd you hear about us?\" Well let's see, we just passed on a 1.5 hour line-up at Libretto and you're next door. So, we lied :)  First thing about Salt, the storefront doesn't do justice to the interior--can't figure out why. The raw wood and concrete that figures in much of the dining room gives the place great ambience. Somehow reminded us of Jamon in NYC.   Older crowd than Libretto and hence fewer high pitched giggles and screams than you get with the \"girls gone wild\" crowd that sometimes overwhelms Ossington. Come to the think of it, the staff look older too--so the tone is altogether more relaxed, less frenetic than other Ossington/Queen hot spots.  And, good tapas (it's a tapas place right?). Ham croquettes were stand out  memorable. Haven't had decent croquettes since Coca. Beet and goat cheese salad. Yup. Good. Tuna crudo ... hmmm... kinda bland. Nothing wrong with the ingredients, just.. was it mango in there... nothing to bring the tuna flavor out. Duck confit mmm, very duck and very confit. Then two beautiful cheeses for desert (from an enormous selection).  I get the impression you could go in there and simply dine on cheese and wine. Should try that sometime. As it was, we had a very credible Crianza with the meal.  Service was attentive.  Definitely give Salt a try."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about it and finally a group of us made reservations for dinner.  Personally I think its a beautifully decorated, overpriced and overhyped tapas place.  Not really worth the trip when there are such gems round the corner as Black Hoof and  Pizza Libretto ."}
{"text":"First off, I agree with many reviewers.  Once, a friend of mine compared their plates lap dances; delicious, expensive and only satisfying for a brief moment.  They used to have rapini on their menu but when I was there last night, there wasn't a green veg at all on their menu.  I feel that it wouldn't throw their food costs out of wack to put just three potatoes and a some green beans on the plate.  Also, I would love to see salt cod of some sort on the menu too.  What I do now is  split a plate of poutine across the street at BMQ before I head to Salt. Why do I like the place so much, I'm very partial to their wine list, I love Vino Verde and want to take a baseball bat to the LCBOs selection.  You will probably never find anything on their list at VIntages, maybe at a quality shop in London or New York but your best bet it to go to Portugal, or to Salt Wine Bar.  The decor is very elegant, yet hip and comfortable and the service is very attentive and there are no snotty attitudes. Also, whatever you do, save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this restaurant. Loved the atmosphere, loved the food and the waiter.  Our reservations were for 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday and the place was hopping. Considering it was so busy, we didn't find it loud at all. Great wine selection, our waiter recommended a delicious bottle of vinho verde, (Muros Antigos). We started with the charcuterie board, shared the alaskan king crab cakes, truffle gnocchi (to die for, wish I had the plate to myself - next time) and the crispy Quebec duck confit. It was enough for the 3 of us. We can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Foie gras - good but not great, as a whole dish it's average Oysters - small but delicious, super fresh, clean. 3 for $9 Pork belly - solid dish. Very tender, everything was fresh and well balanced Tuna ceviche - lame. It's all tomato, definitely not worth $14 because of the lack of tuna, taro chips were stale and poorly fried as they weren't flat as they should be Feature Caesar salad - lame. I make better at home, drunk Bison tartar - tartar was nice, slightly bland, sesame aoli was nice and flavorful but there isn't enough for the amount of tartar. Once again taro chips suck  Go to grand electric for tacos.  Salt is stale."}
{"text":"house made charcuterie board 5/5 buttermilk fried chicken 5/5 crispy duck confit 4/5 spicy lamb meatballs 3/5  iberian style food. hubby and i shared the above and we were more than full.  very romantic atmosphere.  food was amazing. love this place.  would defnt recommend."}
{"text":"Checked out Salt last night (March 4) Great place, so so ambiance and the service was awesome The Tapas we had were delicious, and the friends I was out with mentioned that the Martini's they had were YUMMY, I just drank some Portuguese Sparkling Water which was ok, nothing really special about it.  The only thing I would definitely do a fixer-upper on is that UGLY BROWN CURTAIN they have near the entrance what the heck is that supposed to be, thank goodness for the nice guy that opened the door for me as we were walking into the same place, I would have definitely tripped........  GET RID OF IT, it's not doing anything for your DECOR"}
{"text":"The food had great flavourm tadte and presentation.  Where we all, our party of 7, agreed that the restaurant failed was the portions. The price does not justify the portion size uou receive. Also, the desert menu was lack luster and un-flattering. Indid find the duck a bit on the walty side. All in all anice spot but br sure to eat prior or it can be $$$$$"}
{"text":"Great service, nice (relaxing yet romantic) ambiance (would be good for a semi-dressy first date...or even in semi-casual wear----we came after a round of golf). The beef tenderloin tapas and beet salad were excellent. The charcuterie options were yummy---ESPECIALLY the chorizo. We highly recommend these dishes. The oxtail with blue cheese was a disappointment though. Definitely will return to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Came in on a snowy Sunday night, we had reservations but it was mostly empty tonight.  The food was excellent though and service was great.  I did find a few items were a little heavy on the butter/cream, but gotta live once and awhile!   My favourite dish of the night was the gnocci, melt in your mouth and the sauce we delicious.    We brought our young children with us and I would say that this restaurant was pretty good for younger ones, the tables are not squished together too close and the ambient noise is enough that their louder than normal voices aren't a distraction to other diners! :)"}
{"text":"Went to Salt last night, I was very unimpressed. We had a whole bunch of things, which is the right way to go. Share dishes between two or three people, and you'll get to taste a bunch of things, don't go in and just get one dish expecting to get enough.   We started with the openers, the chicken liver and foie gras pate was yummy, but $8 for a tablespoon of simple guacamole has to be one of the biggest ripoffs I've ever seen.  For Mains we ate the BY FAR most disgustingly salty venison carpaccio ever. After two bites of it, I took a drink of water and it was basically salt water there was so much on it. It was absolutely disgusting, which was so sad because the actual venison was soooo mouthwatering.  The steak also really made me mad, almost enough to give this place a 1. It was cooked really well, but it was chewy and stringy. I'm a bit of a steak snob, and for the price of that small amount of steak, it should have been a prime cut. It was not. So unimpressed. The duck confit was quite good, I enjoyed it, and finally we had some very yummy crostini with figs and manchego... So good.  Our party had the lobster pasta which arrived after everything was done. So people were stuck waiting and waiting.  Our service wasn't great, we were left with empty wine glasses numerous times.   This place is over priced and just not worth it. I have no problem spending exorbitant amounts on food, but it better be worth it. We won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Gorgeous room, friendly staff, intriguing menu, but good goddamn, how little food you get.  What you do get is delicious, but I think we realized we were going to leave hungry when our waiter brought a bread basket to the table that was the size of a fingerbowl.  (Filled with four or five wafer-thin crostini and served with a dab of tapenade.)  The ambience is nice and this place would be great just for drinks, but don't expect a full meal here."}
{"text":"The place is cozy and the candles gives a romantic atmosphere. The strawberry mint Margarita is neat! Totally recommend if you appreciate quality rather than quantity!"}
{"text":"Recently travelled to Salt with two girlfriends to start our night off right on the Ossington strip. Admittedly, my first pick was Foxley, but with a 2 hour wait at 9 pm, we decided to give Salt a try instead. We called ahead on our way down and on arrival were seated at a cozy table by the bar (thank you wind-stopping velvet curtain). It was packed but the numerous tea lights by the wine bottles that line the walls made it feel intimate. After downing a healthy glass of gin/lemon/lime fizz complete with multiple brandied cherries, we were escorted to our dining table for the main attraction.   We shared goat cheese, calamari, tuna, salad plates and of course frites (some of the best I've had). The plates were small but decorative. The taro chips were a nice addition to the tuna ceviche dish and after splitting a bottle of vino verde, our palates were satisfied. We finished off dinner with the passion fruit creme brulee, which lasted a total of 2.5 minutes of spoon attack.  Overall, our experience was good and the service was great. Props to waitstaff who love food and share their taste gusto with recommendations and authentic opinions of menu fare. The plates were small and pricey, though, so if your stomach is walking you down the street, this may not be the most financially responsible choice.   Yearning for another brandied cherry as I write this. Yum."}
{"text":"Nick is the bartender. Introduce yourself and he will make sure that your experience is special.   The cocktails menu is a delight to experiment with and I have never had anything that does not impress.   While the food is delicious, I find it to be a tad overpriced for tapa sized portions. I would recommend the pork belly!  While the service was attentive, I found that they were less than accommodating for special requests even when we were willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"4/5 if you are going for light appetizers/ tapas or to grab some drinks at the end of your night. It is also a great place to start a night out along Ossington. The food is delicious and there are tons of drink options to choose from. It is a very cute place (great for date night). However, You might be disappointed if you wanted a heavy meal. For a bigger meal for dinner check out Salt's sister restaurant Chiado (fantastic seafood)."}
{"text":"If you like tapas-do not go here. this is not tapas, i have lived in Spain and understand the tapas sized portion.  the plates are super tiny, the food is okay, and the prices are WAY overpriced.. And, to claim to be a wine bar-most of the wine is from Portugal-Portugal really-I was surprised.....we spent $105 without tip and left hungry... that is not normal. we will not be returning here and are quite sad due to the fact that we were excited to try, finally, tapas in Toronto and this was bad... real bad!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place and service. Great food but extremely overpriced for the size of the portions."}
{"text":"Reading some of the reviews below, I can only conclude that some people ought to just stay at home and never eat out or travel. This twinkly, charming, empty wine bottle smattered wine bar was a gorgeous, heady, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Willie Dixon and Freddie King marinated escape. The scallops were shockingly perfectly seared, the pork belly was a far cry from the fatty chinatown cuts we snare to broil at home, the octopus was tender as it was flavourful, paired wonderfully with bitter rapini, smoky paprika pepper puree, and confit potatoes, the ribs were of the variety that when shaken slightly, the meat slid off the bone with the same lack of viscosity as our will not to order a fourth glass of the coravin system cradled wine. I understand and dislike the current hip fad of maligning truffle oil, but Salt's venision carpaccio lays my point to rest. Holllyyy sooo good. The food held its own hard, but our super pro server John really completed the night for us. As my husband described, 'he moved like air' (he refolded my napkin when I left to visit the Jane much to our amusement), never disturbing us, always keeping an eye out in case we needed him, gracious, charming and informed. We came in on a whim dressed like People of Walmart's finest in our spring cleaning gear, and not once did anyone, not even the smartly dressed host, make us feel unwelcome or out of place. We're about to settle in the watch the daredevil finale paired with the sea salt flaked chocolate terrine we took home, utterly satisfied. Please don't let the cretins below thwart you, we can't wait to bring our loved ones to this magical place. Thank you for the wonderful night, Salt."}
{"text":"Salt Wine Bar is a terrific Iberian tapas restaurant on Ossington at Dundas.   Comfortable ambience with exposed brick walls lines with bottles of wine.  Everything comes as small sharing portions.  Tapas is not normally my favourite style of dining but as Salt it works extremely well.  We've been twice in the past few months and the food and service were terrific both times.  Highlights were the grilled  calamari, the argentinian-style NY strip loin steak and the sea scallops with pork belly.  The bread & olives to nibble on at the start were addictive.  The charcuterie board appetizer was tasty but we felt it expensive for what we got.  The foie gras and chicken liver pate appetizer was good but not memorable.  Unlike everything we ate, the pate had kind of flavourless.  There are so many other tasty choices on the menu that we make a different selection next time.  A minor quibble.  We had a Chilean Carmenere red wine which was delicious and very well priced.  We sampled several desserts.  Creme Brule was very good.  But it was their take on deep-fried donut dough with a dipping sauce that was a major hit.  Even for a non-dessert eater like me, it was incredible.  Service was attentive and professional.  They are trying very hard and doing an excellent job.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I will try to concentrate on things that haven't been said yet: They are much quieter than Libretto, and are a tad \"nicer\". Great Chilean red wine, two really boring white wines. We had charcuterie (7$, great) and a cheese plate (portion for an anorectic dwarf) with blue cheese (I HATE blue cheese, and they don't swap -- so my friend ate it). I think bread was extra, and it was not much. Great olive oil in really tiny bowls (bowl is too large a word for the microscopic amount). Then we had the fried sardines, which are worth it: salty, crisp, delicious, intense, and actually not that ridiculously small. Deserts were good, rich and not too sweet. The check came a bit larger than I would have thought. Altogether: if you guys want to keep me, give me more food. I am not an anorectic American teenager, I want food in normal amounts. Or lower the prices. There is always Libretto next door, with a full menu at 25$ -- even if it's loud and full -- but no-one can beat their Margarita for 12$. Hey, it's still crisis, and we are young, poor & sexy,"}
{"text":"Had a great meal. Our reservation was at 9:30 and the kitchen was closing so our foods was somewhat rushed. The staff was very friendly. I would recommend the squid, 10/10!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times now, and every time has been great. I like the fact that it takes the local portuguese flavours and modernizes them into tapas dishes. I'm always a sucker for tapas, and cured meats, and they have both. And their portuguese fare is great, from nicely cooked sardines to delicious calamari. The staff is always friendly and I really like the wine list which has a lot of reasonably priced wines - a lot of which you don't find at a lot of other restaurants.  Definitely worth checking out. It's now one of my fave Ossington places."}
{"text":"I've had tapas in Barcelona, Granada and Seville. But never in Toronto.  That changed last weekend.  For my first Toronto tapas joint, this place was go-oooood. Well played!  Loved the ambience, with all the wine bottles lined up on shelves, as if we were in a wine cellar. The place was hopping, but it wasn't out-of-control to the point where we had to shout over the din.  The staff was great - they were courteous, brought things out on time, the works.  For drinks, I had a glass of echeverria (lovely) and a mixed drink (not so great - probably because it had vermouth, which I'm NOW not a fan of).  As for the food ... oh my sweet baby Moses, THE FOOD. Where do I even begin? We ordered so many things off the menu, I honestly can't remember it all. I'm sure we had some charcuterie, and I do recall a small dollop of extra-tasty cheese in there somewhere. But the standouts for me *had* to be the oh-so-sweet pork belly, the salt cod quenelles and the lobster bisque. Honourable mention goes to their oxtail, for the presentation alone.  The dangerous thing about all that good food is the damage it can do to one's wallet. Since it was a friend's birthday, the impulsive glutton-fest came out to $95 per person. Ai yi yiiiii.  But overall, definitely a great place to go, when you want to start a Friday or Saturday night on the town on a slightly classier-than-normal note."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday with a bunch of my girls. It was recommended by a coworker of mine. This restaurant is a Tapa style restaurant so dishes were meant to be shared.  First off - our server was awesome! He always made sure we were doing okay and if we did not know what something was on the menu, he was happy to explain to us! Although, we had 5 girls and he suggested for us to order 16 to 17 tapas. We looked at the menu and counted... that was the whole menu. lol.   Anyway, we ordered a the cheese board, the fois gras pate, chorizo meatballs, duck confit, wild mushroom gnocchi, grilled octopus, and the crab cakes.   The cheeseboard came out first and it consisted of several different cheeses to which I do not remember what they are anymore. The fois gras pate came out next and it was delicious. Both the cheeseboard and the pate came with crispy pita chips. Those pita chips were the best. I loved it and I could not stop nibbling on them throughout the night. The chorizo meatballs were also delicious but I felt that there was nothing too special about it - it was just three meatballs in some tomato sauce with a kick of spice. The crab cakes were also pretty good although I thought it was a bit dry. I am not a huge fan of seafood so I did not have any of the grilled octopus so I personally cannot comment on it, but it was eaten quickly by my friends. The duck confit and the wild mushroom gnocchi are tied in first place for me. I am not a huge duck fan (I don't eat a lot of duck), but I could not stop nibbling on this one! It melted in my mouth. Words cannot describe how delicious it was. The last item I had was the wild mushroom gnocchi. O M G. This came in a creamy sauce and it had a strong mushroom taste to it. It was so delicious (I am a huge fan of mushroom) and the tiny gnocchis were perfect!! I seriously didn't even have to chew. It was THAT good.   Overall, good service, great food, awesome ambiance! I will definitely go back just for the wild mushroom gnocchi and the duck confit!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful room.  Tapas style food with great flavour. Only downfall -portions are a bit small Nice date place-especially for the ladies with smallish appetites."}
{"text":"Went to Salt with girlfriends on Saturday night.  It was an awful experience from beginning to end.  Our server was extremely rude from the onset.  She recommended we order 10 to 12 dishes between the 4 of us... we were all pretty full from a late lunch so did not feel the need to order 3 dishes each.  She also noted that if we wanted to add food on later, it would be a 45 minute wait... what kind of nonsense is that?? It would take 45 minutes to make 1 extra dish if I added it on after my initial order??  After we placed our food order and drinks.. we did not see our server again for the rest of the night.  She did not come by once to ask us how our food was (mediocre at best) or to ask us if we wanted another round of drinks.. After we were done eating, she simply walks by and slams the bill on our table without saying a word.  With terrible service, average food... you bet I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much.  We had no problem reserving a table on a Friday night, but the place was pretty busy by 8pm.  We liked each dish we had.  Agree with others that the ceviche is a highlight."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The food was delicious! My partner was raving about the crispy soft shell crab, and I loved the beef tenderloin & short rib. The wine selection was great, with a wide variety of Portuguese wines to compliment the menu. The service was was attentive, polite, and had very good recommendations (hence the soft shell crab, which is not something I would ever order on my own). I will definitely come back and recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a date or upscale dinner. Nice decor and ambiance. Great drinks and very attentive service at the bar. Lots of tapas items and reasonable prices. Narrow room so the tables are a little close to each other but overall a really nice spot."}
{"text":"This place costs way to much for what you get. Two slices of toasted crostini (average bread quality) with fig jam (tasty) and a couple slices of manchego cheese with three walnuts on top ... That is a $10 tapa!  After sharing 5 tapas we stopped for poutine on the way home!"}
{"text":"It's been 3 days and I'm still fantasizing about our recent dinner at Salt Wine Bar on Saturday night. I'd heard about this Iberian tapas place from friends in past and the word had been pretty good, a few standout dishes were a must try and overall the meal was a great.  I feel like my friends undersold this Ossington standout. Our experience was amazing. We had a later reso, around 8:45pm, and upon arrival had a great cozy corner spot near the rear of the restaurant.  Our server came by and walked us through the menu while explaining the recommended number of tapas plates we should order for a group our size (typically 2 dishes per person). We had 6 people together so this meant we could be frivolous with our 12 choices and order some doubles while really testing the limits of the menu.  I'll be honest, I can't recall everything we had but here is a list of all the items I remember, and know that for the most part everything was amazing and I would 100% order them again: Octopus, meatballs, sea bream ceviche, steak frites, steak tartar, wild mushroom gnocchi, rapini, large sized cheese board...  Some of the above were ordered twice to ensure everyone received a good tasting of it. My one complaint was with the cheese board as I felt that while the taste of the cheeses were quite nice and paired nicely with our meals, I felt it to be overpriced for the portion size that was offered.  Aside from the food, I also imbibed on their smoked old fashioned for starters and 4 of us shared in an excellent bottle of wine which sat around the $75 mark.  As is the case with many Tapas restaurants, when you're ordering so many small dishes at times the price can creep up on you. The average price per head worked out (with booze) to be around $100 by the end of the night, not the highest I've paid but certainly on the pricier side. So conservative diners beware.  Overall, would return (just to have the meatballs and steak frites all to myself).   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"We came for my bday, and this time for my wife's. We love it here. Imo, the drinks the best in the city, and Nick always has something up his sleeve for everyone.   Drinks: - Manhattan infused with blowtorched cedar shavings. If you like bourbon, if you like cedar smell... bang! - Mint julep. Who the heck has mint juleps anymore? But wow was it ever good. - Can't remember what the other 3 drinks were.  Ceviche - so-so... too much good raw seafood in the city to do this again. Slow-braised rabbit tortillas - Holy smokes, this blew me away. Amazing. Would eat again! Sausages - Had venison, bacon, and foie gras. Wife don't like foie, but loved these. Would eat again!  We do revisit this place for a reason, even though it's packed on Sat nites."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was the best meal I've ever had. I had the Paella and went through a brief depression when it was gone.  We started with charcuterie, which was amazing, had Paella and then had dessert. I don't remember what dessert was (this review is a year in the making) but I remember biting into it and just saying \"f*^k\" because I couldn't believe how every course could be.so.good.  The bartender looked like a clone of James Darmody from Boardwalk Empire but he was so passionate and into our drinks that it made me wish I cared about anything that much. I cannot wait to get back to Toronto and bring my friends with me so they can see what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"- went last night because pizza librietto had a one hour wait for a table, so this was a good spot for passing the time. - very romantic and cozy feeling spot. beautifully done up.  - wine-wise, decent selection. its better at most other spots. - can only comment on the Charcuterie plate food-wise... honestly, it was pretty weak, and uninspired. cuz ive been to the black off."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend after we learned there was an hour wait at Yours Truly. (I notice a similar trend in the other reviews!)  We still had to wait half an hour for a table, but c'est la vie. Our waiter was very efficient and our selections came really quickly (to the point that I remarked that this place must be able to turn over tables like nobody's business).   When we arrived, I immediately thought it would be a great date place. I love the wooden shelving around the room and the wine bottles everywhere. However...on a date I would never want to have to either order five things to feel full or share the small portions!   The food was, however, delicious. In particular the octopus paired with potato, which sounded weird at first, was perfect. The tacos were also a good size, and quite tasty."}
{"text":"This place missed the mark for me. It's a gorgeous space with a great ambience, however, the service and food need some work.  Take the name of this place seriously. I found the food to be over-seasoned and quite salty.   I ordered the asparagus and oyster mushroom risotto for dinner and what I got was good ol' Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice instead; pretty sure that frozen carrot, peas, and lima bean mix you can buy in the grocery store was thrown into it as well. To top it off, it was incredibly salty.  My dining group and I all agreed that it was definitely not risotto. The others were equally unsatisfied with their dinner choice.  Most of the staff seemed friendly, however, there was something that seemed artificial about everyone working here. Our server even questioned my friends dinner option with an \"Oh, that's all you're ordering?\" Clearly, this could have been phrased more appropriately.  I'm disappointed both thinking and writing about my experience at Salt...  Honourable Mentions: - Think Spain: a nice array of cow, sheep, and goat's milk cheese, wine, and meat - Beautiful space for date night"}
{"text":"Overall food, drinks and service are very overpriced, overhyped and mediocre. I'm happy to pay more for food & drinks but the taste doesn't justify the price point especially compared to the superior food/drinks at other restaurants/bars in Toronto.  The food is tapas style, overpriced for its tiny portion and taste. The scallop ceviche is too salty 2/5, steak tartar doesn't taste fresh 3/5, babyback ribs were greasy but at least the sauce saves it somewhat 3.5/5... If you want ceviche and a bar, Mira restaurant near King W is a better place to go.  The drinks are also average at best. I had to return a drink because it came out nothing like the description, but the waitress who suggested she return it for me still put it on my bill. Besides handmade drinks, I also expect better wine selection for a wine bar. Grey Gardens at Kensington is a wayyy better wine bar (not to mention miles tastier food).  Service is very slow, food took a while to come out despite the bar being relatively empty; and noone paid attention to ask us as soon as we got our food.   If you're in the area and wanna go to a bar, go to Reposado Bar & Lounge a couple of mins down the road instead - better food, and awemazing drinks. Don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"It was my birthday and I wanted to try somewhere new. My friend heard that Salt Wine Bar was excellent. I made reservations and off we went. Close to Ossington & Dundas, I walked right by it! I completely missed the sign on the sidewalk, but still made it on time. Keep an eye out when you head over!   When you get inside you are surrounded by wine. They have a large wine list, many of which I had never heard of. Their cocktail list is also interesting, some ingredients I had never heard of. It was a night to learn of new things! Our server was patient as we tried to decide what to get; everything looked amazing.  We decided! Sea Bream Ceviche($13), Lobster & Pork Belly($18), Jamon Serano & Manchego Croquettes($8) and Truffle Gnocchi($22). The ceviche arrived first. We each ordered our own and we were glad we did. It was to-die-for. The mixture of the sea bream, cucumber and pineapple made this an instant favourite. My Lobster & Pork Belly arrived and it looked so pretty, I didn't want to eat it. It was alright, the small lobster tail was a little tough, but the pork belly was fatty, juicy and tender. The Truffle Gnocchi is the kind of dish that you involuntarily roll your eyes back in your head with your first bite. Creamy and mushroomy, this was a fantastic gnocchi! The Croquettes were also quite taste and super cute. The smooth filling topped with grainy mustard was a great plate to share.  Dessert! We saw Crème Brulee on the menu and knew we had to get it. It arrived and you could tell it was just made. Sugar was warm and the custard was creamy. I told them it was my birthday and our server put a candle with it. So sweet of her! A great ending to fantastic meal.   I'd love to try the rest of the menu. I can't believe every dish was so good! Must have more!"}
{"text":"My buddy came in from out of town and we were looking for a neighborhood that represented what is happening lately in TO (I know, it's hard to choose). I asked my contact in the area about his top three recommendations in Ossington Village, and this was one of them. We really had a great time camping out by the bar and drinking in the atmosphere. A refreshing lack of attitude and the chef takes pride in the variety of tapas offerings."}
{"text":"Great date night or double date night spot! Warm, trendy and inviting restaurant with excellent food for sharing and a great selection of wines. Compliments to the chefs! Waitress was a bit reserved and cold, but overall, the food, wine and atmosphere made for a great night!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and ambiance!   We ordered five dishes between the two of us and we're quite full by the end of the meal. We had steak tartar (wonderful!), ceviche, Gnocchi, venison sausage, heirloom tomato salad and the Serrano ham starter. All of it absolutely delicious, varied spices/flavours and super fresh. It is tapas, so be prepared to try a few different things--next time I wanna get my hands on some fried chicken."}
{"text":"Salt how can we describe our night, four of us out for a dining experience. The bar has a nice warm vibe, ambient lighting and decor , surrounded by wine bottles displayed throughout restaurant as expected in a wine bar. Our server was pleasant and attentive upon our seating , however he did miss entering one of our Tapas , forgot the Octopuss, hence we doubled up on the Truffled Gnocchi and Braised Short Ribs. As for the Tapas we selected eleven , and also Churro's for dessert and after dinner Port. Even though the food is described as Tapas, servings lack a Tapas presentation and portions are a little  pricey for what you get,  Braised Short Ribs , tender and delicious, however 2 orders 4 bones in total $54, Truffled Gnocchi moist delicious , presentation looked like a typical half order, 4 people 2 forks each, so tasty, double up $46. Fried Butter Chicken 4pcs excellent. Sautéed Rapini, Asparagus Salad, nice however not really Tapas, more inline as a side on an entree. Scallop Ceviche very disappointing , Scallop, Cucumber and Lime,  paper thin looked like it went thru a micro plane shaver , TASTELESS. Patatas Bravas with a side of Chorizo, savoury, here again get rid of the micro plane shaver, couldn't taste the Chorizo.  Wine selection is predominately Portuguese and Spanish wines that are not listed on the LCBO, so you better be familiar with wine regions, nice selection for an Iberian resto.  Now I can never get this concept in a Wine Bar, $22 wine marked up to $90, I would just love to try more of their wine and Taxi myself home safely, however not possible here in the Big Smoke. Hey people from my trips across the pond my experience with Tapas in Europe , their casual, value oriented social bars to meet and eat, Salt your a little \" Salty\" you could be great if you tweak the place up."}
{"text":"Service to get the first drink was very slow. 15mins!!  But after we got our bottle of wine and food started arriving was fabulous. We enjoyed the food tremendously . I am not sure if they were short staffed but we will only return on a week night."}
{"text":"I love this place! Came here before on a weekend and today on a whim and the tapas and ambiance is excellent. Just a nice casual, dimly lit relaxing environment for an intimate evening to just chill, have some wine and nibble on some good bites..."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, although I'm not sure I can justify the price. I have to agree with some of the reviewers here and say that the portion sizes are small. If you visit, be prepared to get at least 3-4 dishes per person. I enjoyed the food I just don't think I was prepared to pay that much.   I liked the crispy pork belly. The pork meat was soft, and nicely contrasted the crunchy pork crackling. The pork skin was nicely rendered down wonderfully, which made great crackling. All the components of each of the dishes worked really well. My favourite dish was the mushroom truffle dish. Any dish that contains truffles elevates a dish. The food was beautifully presented, and a great use of plate space.   They do have a really nice selection of wines and the place is nicely decorated, showcasing the different wines.  The service for most part was good. I was immediately greeted when we first arrived and the bartender was friendly. However, I felt like the waiter after he took our order, ignored us.   Not sure if I would go back for another visit. I can't deny the food is good, but I have tried better."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have the same similar positive experience as Bar isabel and someone recommended this place.   I'm so glad we went because it was great in their own unique way.  Great service and excellent food! For a tapas place, we finished feeling full and satisfied! Sea bream cerviche, paella, octopus and potatoes  (yes the potatoes dish was great too!)."}
{"text":"Good and genuine service.  Small portioned food well prepared;  long wine list starting at $50 and it is fine to stay near that mark.  Ambiance a cellar, and you can hear yourself think. Recommendable."}
{"text":"Service was good. The food on the other hand was not. I have been going to salt for many years and the last two times I went were not nearly as delicious as they have been in the past. Nothing was delicious nothing was exciting if anything overdressed and under tasty. Maybe they got a new chef but whoever's in the kitchen is not nearly as good as has been the past. Whenever I have a mediocre meal At a go to restaurant I give it one more try. Tonight was my one more try and my very last one. Sad I used to love this place but no more"}
{"text":"The beet salad was bitter, the buttermilk fried chicken too salty and the risotto tasted like pure garlic. The only tolerable thing we ate were the baby back ribs. Maybe the kitchen had an off night? For the price we paid for that food that's still no excuse. At least the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Delicious food, small portions for the price though! Service was great too and the ambience was lively and fun. Wine was crazy expensive tho...:( bottles of red start at $50! Have been twice, and despite prices, will come again. Would be perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"A fun place on a Saturday night. Called and made reservations which I definitely recommend doing because it got busy very quickly.  The waiter was extremely knowledgeable on the menu, and we ended up not using the menu at all but his recommendations. Picked the perfect wine and all the food complimented it gracefully.  The seam bream was fantastic and fresh.. Topped with cilantro and jalapeños. The duck sausage on the meat platter still makes my mouth water thinking about it! A good date night kind of place, it's loud and busy so you have to lean in to chat but that's romantic isn't it?"}
{"text":"wow. expensive, teeny portions, and we had to order pizza afterwards. oh and the complaint was that it took so long between dishes for Tapas. We were told they only had one chef on sat night... whyyy?  we ordered more than half the items on the menu, octopus, steak, crab cake, ribs, duck, cheese board, beef tartare, bread, scallop and pork belly, and whatever dish of the day rabbit sausage.    octopus, and duck were actually good, but I mean I only had one bite. the other dishes are not even memorable. We walked away hungry and having to order pizza. it's unfortunate, we didn't have a good experience.  Nope not gonna visit here again."}
{"text":"Two things you should know about this place. 1) the food is delicious 2) the portions are tiny  4 of us decided to try this place out on Friday evening for drinks and nibblies...and we definitely got nibblies. I understand it's a tapas menu, but seriously?  If the plates are designed for sharing, I would hope that they would a little bit more food on them.  We ordered the beet carpacio, the beef tartare, prawns, risotto, chorizo sausage plate and the pulled pork crostini.  We had assumed, incorrectly, that ordering 2 plates per person would be sufficient.  Boy, were we wrong.  I cannot complain too much about the quality of the food, wine or ambiance of the restaurant.  Yes, the risotto was a bit underdone in my opinion, the 12 slivers (yes, slivers - not slices) of chorizo were very tasty, but way to small a portion size.   I did really enjoy the beet carpacio and the beef tartare, but again...too little of either was served.  I guess if you're going to hit Salt Wine Bar you should be ready to pay for the ambiance, the place is lovely, but at the end of the night, be ready to hit up another restaurant for some cheap eats that won't leave you hungry (that's what we did)."}
{"text":"I wonder what it's like to dine in a wine cellar...  Enter: Salt Wine Bar.  Solid service, fabulous food, intimate atmosphere. Take your beau here or make it family ordeal or a classy GNO affair; very versatile space where you honestly can choose any dish and it won't disappoint.   We tried (and would try again): patatas bravas, truffle gnocchi, grilled octopus, and scallop ceviche verde."}
{"text":"3.75. Went for a girls dinner recently. Everything was chill and tasty. Highlights for me were the lighter, smaller plates. Great for sharing. Beet salad and manchego cheese crustini. They paced things well and server was kind. A bit slow at the start and they had no ginger beer.   Wine list is great and creative.   Not funky or cool really. More of a grown up, if slightly laid back vibe. The lighting is warm and romantic, with wine lining the walls. Older crowd. Good place for taking parents or colleagues. Also worked well for girl chats, which is what we were up to.   Would go again but not in a crazy rush. Nice place to have on the roster for when you fancy a wine oriented meal."}
{"text":"Four of us had a fine meal last night at Salt. Uncrowded, relatively quiet room, lined with wine bottles. A wide range of tapas everyone of which was fine--risotto, ceviche, ribs, calamari, merge sausage, and great churros. Very good and prompt service too. Our only complaint was that the wine was priced too high."}
{"text":"This place is not over hyped... Salt wine bar is actually SO GOOD.   Yes the portions are small but every single portion is quality and well worth it. We're coming here for tapas and good wine not uncomfortably huge North American portions.  Order a few dishes. Eat slowly and taste it. Sip it with your wine and enjoy the show while the mixologist smokes your old fashion.  Although the cocktails are mediocre, the food is outstanding, and the wine selection is above average."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the place. It was our first time there and we were disapointed. Unfortunatelly service is not the best, we walk in the bar saturday night 10pm, place is empty, only 4 tables w people. 5 servers at the bar looking at us, no one says anything, finally bar tender asks  how many people. He ask us to wait again, ????? Really? He desapeared and while he is gone everybody at the bar keep looking at us, but noone has the decency of asking if we have been served or if we need help. Finally bar tender comes back and give us a table. It was hard to understand the server and he kept asking us to repeat bcs the music was so loud and we could not understand him either.  Not really knowledgeable, they were all over the place and not very attentive with customers. It is a shame because the place is really nice, we loved it and the concept is great. Food was nice too."}
{"text":"Had three small but not tiny soft tacos and a beer, $20.38 with tip.  My appetite was moderate so that was enough.   Given the price, I don't see grounds for complaint about portion size, and the food was excellent.   Pull pork, smoked oxtail and duck confit were the main ingredients, all well prepared, with thoughtful accompaniments."}
{"text":"Tapas at Salt translates to small portions and decently good food, nothing particularly special though. The wine was subpar. The server had an awkward table manner. The noise level was high, Salt could really use some rugs. Decor was nice. Overall it was just fair. There are better dining options in the area so I doubt we will return. They'll probably succeed without us based on spill over from Pizzeria Libretto."}
{"text":"For four tapas and dessert the meal was pretty pricey, and i really wish it was for a good reason but i hardly found the food to be memorable or delectable. I try and reason we were paying for service more than food.....   We had the venison carpaccio and other than tenderness, it was hard to say it was anything great. The grilled octopus was not particularly flavourful. We also had the duck which was better than most tapas but did not taste like duck. Finally pitatas fritas were fine. The churros were good but i have had better. Sadly, the meal did not live up to its price and thus our expectations.   However, shoutout to our great waiter. He takes his job seriously and was a great guy."}
{"text":"It's very expensive for the portions. The service was very good. The wine was off and we told the waiter and they replaced the wine but I was expecting for a wine bar better quality. Meh would not go back."}
{"text":"We ordered two glasses of wine, each around $12.00.  To our surprise, rather than opening a new bottle (we were the first people in there at 6:00 PM on a week night), the waiter poured us day-old wines.  Both -- different bottles, different wines -- were quite sour and not passable as $12.00 a glass wines.  We told the waiter.  The manager tasted the wine and told us there was nothing wrong with either glass.  He said that wine that is kept in the cellar can taste a little \"sharp,\" (as it was opened the day previous, and thus had more than enough time to breathe, this made no sense) but made no apologies for serving day-old wine that had gone off, which we both knew was obviously the culprit.  Nor did he offer to open a new bottle.  The only things that spare this place a 1-star review are the facts that (1) he was polite, and (2) he took the wine back and didn't charge us, so we just left.  I'm not sure what else to say about a purported \"wine bar\" where the manager is content to serve off wine, and would prefer to save a few bucks by not opening a new bottle at the beginning of the night but still charge a premium price.  I think the thing speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This place gets one star because the wine is great and the decor is lovely.  But as many others have said, the portion sizes are laughable and the staff are rude.  I love eating out, I have no problem spending good money on good food, but Salt has got to come to grips with their price-point."}
{"text":"Some people are so salty about Salt.   Yes, the portions are small but it is a sharing plates restaurant.  Yes, the food doesn't always knock your socks off but it is much better than just good, It is often great.  Yes, bills are frequently $100 or more however, we actually find it one of the better value restaurants in the city.  As an example, you can easily spend more than that at Bar Rival with substantially less food and beverage. Nope, never had bad service here, ever.  In fact, we find the service here friendly and efficient.   We have been going here on and off for more than 5 years and although they sometimes have their off  nights food wise, service is always good and there have been less than a handful of times their food wasn't great.   Go to for date night and bringing out of towners"}
{"text":"We were so hungover from last night so we skipped out on the wine but had enough of an appetite to tell if the food was good or not.  We had ordered:  Sauteed rapini - like any other rapini dish...  Beet salad - a pretty salad. Refreshing and good quantity of it.  Patatas bravas - tasted like eggs smart home fries... but freshly fried..   King crab cakes - my fave dish from everything else. Nothing special but was the tastiest. Their unique sauces that came with it made it worthwhile (still not worth $18)  Risotto negra - definitely not our cup of tea. Maybe it was because it was our last dish (quite full), but this was my least favourited dish amongst everything else.   I was happy throughout the entire visit but having to write this review has made me realize how disappointing the food was..  Overall though, the service saved the restaurant's name."}
{"text":"didn't eat here -- this review is for the bar scene only.  and the bar scene really did it for me. great bartender -- knew his stuff and was incredibly friendly (especially toward my hottest friend!) but not overbearing or annoying.  the cocktails and wine were terrific, but it's the ambiance that kicked everything up a notch for me here. what a gorgeous space -- and with the huge curtain blocking most of the front, it felt like we were completely insulated from the outside world, cut off from all of our problems for the duration of our stay. (maybe it was actually the alcohol promoting this relaxation ... but i do think the beautiful dark wood and little dim lanterns had something to do with it ...)"}
{"text":"Amazing tapas & wine selection. The service was fantastic as well. Only complaint (and it's really a small one), we were 4 at the table & many tapas were in 3s. Quality, selection & service = great experience."}
{"text":"Popped in here on a Tuesday night, totally on a whim.  No resos and no idea of any ratings or reviews the place had.  They seated us immediately, and within seconds we had waters and were placing our drink orders.    I would call Salt \"spendy\" rather than \"pricey\".  We ordered some incredible dishes that were beautifully prepared.  The portions were, in the tapas style, small... which works in my favour since I am so indecisive.  We started with bread and olives, and a plate of venison carpaccio, which was delicious.  I especially enjoyed the watercress and truffle that garnished the dish.  So delightful.    We shared the ribs, which were absolutely fall off the bone tender, however somewhat bland in flavour.  Then we shared the DUCK, which was BEAUTIFULLY done.  The skin was light and crispy, and the meat was dark and and juicy.    We finished our meal with dessert, splitting the creme brulee and churros.  Both were excellent, and in fact, the creme brulee was the best I have had in many years, if not ever.   It does get loud in the restaurant, something the staff can't help.  However, it did take away from the date experience at times."}
{"text":"Truly delicious food, warm and friendly service, wonderful wine selection. Highly recommend the mushroom brioche!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Salt.   This lovely wine and tapas bar has been a staple for me since I first discovered it during Nuit Blanche.  I've not yet found a day of the week where it's not quite packed, but have not had to wait more than an hour for a table, and they're often quite happy to take \"I'm on my way, please put me on the list!\" night-of pseudo-reservations.  You can often find a seat at a bar table, or the bar, but there have been times when the wait to get a while-I'm-waiting-to-eat drink has taken longer than the time it takes to prepare my food; most of the time I have only seen one or two folks behind the bar, a tall order for such a packed house.  That said, the bar and wait staff have always been pleasant, especially their usual Saturday night bartender; he made sure our drinks were FULL of brandied cherries on my last evening there, and did apologize for sporadic visits to our table.   I love the feel of Salt.  As Sam R (one of my recent dining companions at Salt, no less!) references, the place feels very intimate; I've never given second thought to launching into conversation of the kind of topics that are considered more socially acceptable at one's coffee table.  The noise level is also perfect for conversation; the music is not so loud one has to raise their voice to throat-hurting levels to be heard, not so quiet that the aforementioned inappropriate chats are heard by those dining behind you.  The decor is lovely: preserves and wine bottles in the dining area, mix-and-match chandeliers and pendants, and highly enjoyable quotations written in chalk on the walks that make me giggle and affirm my life choices (ie, \"If you don't drink, then all your stories suck and end with 'And then I got home' \").  The food and drink are delicious.  No, I would not say orgasmically exceptional, but certainly delicious.  Their wines are excellent, and reasonably priced and their menu spans mutiple options for multiple diets; last meal was with a gluten-free friend and a vegetarian.  My strongest suggestion, though: save room for the incredible churros with dolche de leche.  I shared it with a girlfriend and it was the PERFECT beginning to our evening."}
{"text":"Amazing drink and unique cocktails made by amazing bartenders. Great place for tasting tapas plate and shared meals between a group of friends. Great atmosphere in a very cool spot."}
{"text":"Came here just for drinks and apps on a Friday night. The place had a great ambience. While we didn't try any wine we had some great Belgian beers. The oxtail poutine was also the bomb!   We will be back to try a full meal! And wine of course!"}
{"text":"My friend planned a dinner here for 8 of us the other night and I really enjoyed the experience. It's small, has dim lighting and the walls are filled with wine bottles. We shared everything, if you're planning on going with an group of 8 I would suggest to get 3 orders of whatever you want to try so that everyone gets a bite. I would actually suggest this as a date place over going with a group of friends."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  VIBE  I love the look of this place. The perimeter of the whole bar is surrounded by wine bottles so it feels like you're in a wine cellar on the top floor. Lots of chandeliers and dim lighting are bonus points in my books.   It's a bustling, sophisticated atmosphere and lots of dates and young professionals hanging out here.   WE ATE/DRANK If you love seafood, you're in for a treat. That's their specialty here.  We were waiting for our reservation next door at Yours Truly so we had a glass of wine and the ceviche.   Wine: Alandra - notes of honey, apple and pear clean finish  It's a great wine if you're just starting with an appetizer or getting your night started.  Light and refreshing and not overly sweet. I'd get this again.   The ceviche was a surprise. I'm used to having it in a bowl but it was all laid out on a wooden platter. The presentation was lovely but I wasn't expecting it at all. It also wasn't very filling. That said, the flavours went very well together if you like citrus tastes. I probably wouldn't get it again though.  OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Salt is not salty but left a sweet aftertaste in my mouth. I'd come back.  Great first date place or place to catch up with a long lost girlfriend.  I agree with Lauren -- it'd have 4/5 star potential if the food was more hearty."}
{"text":"If you want a great night out and discover some wonderful wines you need to visit Salt. Great for a date or with a group, Salt is a gem on Ossington Ave. I love the Tapas servings for sharing your food and the wonder wine selection from Spain and Portugal cannot be passed up. One of my favourite drinks is the cedar smoked Old Fashioned. Truly a \"smokey\" test smooth drink.   Wonderful and delicious always. You have to go!!"}
{"text":"Hubby took me here as our last date night before baby arrives as I'm just past 38 weeks pregnant right now.  We were looking for a place that had comfortable seating, classy atmosphere and was romantic.  3 check marks here.  Salt Wine Bar really did not disappoint any of our expectations.  Service - Our server was a really nice guy, super attentive and made perfect recommendations.  When we sat down he shared with us the style of plating (tapas) and suggested that we order around 5 dishes to share as that tended to be the perfect amount for 2 people (he was right).  He also helped with a wine selection for the hubby which he very much enjoyed.  Food -  1. Started with the charcuterie (5-6 different meats, spreads) which came with bread and cornbread crisps and pickled veg.  Delicious. 2. Beet salad - a really lovely light side dish with a creamy dressing - so good and hubby enjoyed it too, even though he's not one for beets.  3.  Fried chicken - was spicy and crispy and really flavourful (hubby's favourite). 4. Lamb meatballs - my god.  Flavour town all the way.  MUST TRY. 5.  Short ribs - with pineapple, sweet and spicy flavours, meat was fall off the bone.    Dessert - we split the creme brulee and churros and laughed and enjoyed the entire thing.  Great way to top off an amazing dinner.  Overall would highly recommend and we will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing memorable. For the price you hope it would be a memorable meal. The drinks were creative and strong. Compared to other tapas type places in the area I think there are better options."}
{"text":"I have been to Salt on multiple occasions and I have delighted in virtually every dish on the menu.  The service is well above average and the atmosphere is intimate.  On my last visit the four of us had 8 dishes and 7 beers for less than $200 including tax.  I am well satisfied and continue to be a fan."}
{"text":"Salt has an impressive menu that covers many tastes.  From Tapas to cheese to antipasti.  Some other reviewers mentioned portion sizes but I am not one to stuff myself just enjoy the delicious flavours of each course.  Great drinks menu as well.  A fine place for a meal or a cocktail.  Relaxed atmosphere with warm ambience.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I would have give this a 5 star rating had we not been recognized for my girlfriends birthday. I mentioned it at the time of reservation and also to our server when we arrived. The table beside us (same server) brought out churros and I overhear her say \"I heard its your birthday! Enjoy these on the house\". I was expecting the same recognition however she just brought the bill so it definitely left a bad taste on a great dinner. That being said the venison tartar with truffle and rock salt was immaculate. I believe every customer should be treated with the same expectations the lack of recognition really ruined it for me though."}
{"text":"Props to LG for telling it like it is.  Honestly - this place has 4-5 star potential, but the extreme ridiculousness of the portion sizes drops it immediately to a 2. W-T-F?  Tapas are supposed to SHARED plates. The portions here are so tiny that you would possibly need a magnifying glass if you tried cutting some of the food into pieces. The \"plates\" ranged in price from $8-$15 or so. You would honestly have to order about 10 plates each to feel satisfied. I was a complete joke. We actually had to go and eat cheap Vietnamese food afterward.   I recently ate at Le Bremner in Montreal (Chuck Hughes new place) which also serves up \"shared plates\". The cost of the dishes there were on par with Salt Wine Bar, yet the portions were 5-6 times larger.  It's sad - because everything else about this place is great. Amazing wine selection, lovely ambiance/decor and extremely attentive waitstaff. Unfortunately it's just extremely overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been once and will definitely go back! The food was excellent! My boyfriend and I ordered 5 dishes and dessert- every plate was delicious and I loved the mix of flavours common to Portuguese cusine. Our waiter was knowledgable, warm and friendly. I look forward to going back.  I'm really surprised that people commented on portion size- it's a Tapas bar, they're suppose to be small and flavourful!"}
{"text":"Best Tapas I've EVER had!!! Every single tapas dish that I had, from the oysters to the assorted meats and cheeses plate, to the absolutely delectable wine and pickled grapes, was above perfect. The mood was warm and casual. The variety and the quality of the Tapas menu was very good. Duck Confit (amazing!), crab croquettes sent my taste buds to a happy place. Great service! I will certainly return here again. One of my favorite simple restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with 3 friends. The ambiance is nice and all staff really friendly. Our waiter recommended to order 3-4 dishes per person (what?), each dish is between $20 to $28!!  We got a cheese platter, red prawns, octopus, steak and frites and mushroom gnocchi. The food quality was excellent. We were all amazed and loved everything. But it was just a tease!   We were pretty satisfied but we also didn't want to go crazy.  The wines were great but the list doesn't explain itself very well, you need help to understand what is what since all the names are in Portuguese and Spanish.  We had a great experience, it was too pricey for me, considering I just had a few bites of food."}
{"text":"I really don't know why the hype about this place is. I didn't find it good. It's very loud so it's hard to have a conversation. Service is not great and the food I found mediocre. Maybe it was what we ordered. We had the ceviche. The fish was way too thin. We also had the lobster cake which only brought to cakes which was difficult to share between three people. We also had the lamb sausage and the risotto. Smallest serving of risotto I have ever tried. Because we were still hungry, we ordered the ribs thinking it would fill us up but it was all bone as well and the meat was not great. Overall I am never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and great wine selection. We shared 7 dishes between 3 of us and it was a ton of food. My two favourite stand-out dishes would definitely be the octopus (so tender) and the steak tartare (tons of flavour) but apparently they change the menu frequently so who knows if these will be available again. The service was also outstanding.  I can't wait to come back and try more another time soon."}
{"text":"Shoop. Push It. Everybody knows Salt n Pepa belong together, and I had a lovely bestie date here with Matt M last weekend. He is the Salt to my Pepper, the butter to my bread, the Ann Perkins to my Leslie Knope.   We started with their smoked cedar Manhattan, which sounds over-the-top and douche-y but it was tasty and a pretty average price for a fancy cocktail on the strip -- much cheaper than BarChef or somewhere cooking up something similar.   We then ordered a bottle of the reserve cava. Because treat yo'self. It was delicious, but to be honest I can't tell the difference between a $90 bottle of Cava or a $20, so I should probably keep the plastic in my pocket and go for the cheaper option next time. To eat we had the cheese board and beat salad followed by the duck confit, which was like poultry candy. All delish.   The tables for two are spaced a little too close together for my liking. The date sitting next to us was the wooo-oorst and constantly looked at our fun with disdain, which only made us more fun.   This review was fully powered by bestie Parks and Rec binge watching.   #jeanralpheoforlife"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food, but their drinks are spectacular! Their drinks are all custom crafted by very knowledgable bartenders who go out of their way to make them special... ie. using a wood chipper to smoke the glass they use for their manhattans! this bar really helps put Toronto on the map for the bartending and cocktail scene that is so big in the states. They also have a great wine selection and great staff.  Alas, they're a bit expensive for me to come back as regularly as I would like but definitely a treat that is worth the money.  We will be back for food sometime soon I hope!"}
{"text":"Salt is a very cozy little place and great for a date night when you don't want to go home in a food coma. Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, but a little on the pretentious/overly hipster side. The cocktail I had was absolutely amazing - I think it was the Budapest Punch. Whatever it was, it tasted just like a cherry lifesaver!    The food that we ordered was good, but not great - the charcuterie board, bread & olives, venison carpaccio, chorizo special, and a chocolate dessert. I think it may have been our selections, but I left a little underwhelmed - the charcuterie board was so teeny tiny we added the bread & olives to supplement, and the venison didn't taste any different than a beef carpaccio. If I were to go back, I'd try a few of their warm dishes: judging the by the table next to ours, the portions were a little larger and looked mighty tasty."}
{"text":"1 1/2*  This is the second time I've gone to Salt - both for birthday parties and again I've been disappointed.  We ordered an assortment of food from the menu.   This time I tried 3: charcuterie platter, duck risotto, bison tartar.  The Charcuterie platter included pork & duck prosciutto, some from of pulled pork spread, chorizo & what I think was a rabbit patte  All were mediocre except the pulled pork spread.   That seemed to be balanced (although quite bland.)     The duck risotto came with a duck leg/thigh bone in on top of risotto.  The risotto in the duck risotto was way too watery, although the risotto itself was finished properly.   It seemed to have quite a bit of butter - which of course tastes great.      The duck itself was nicely done.  The skin was crispy and delicious - and normally i try a little and leave the rest, but I couldn't resist finishing it.    The bison tartar was properly seasoned with salt and other spices.   This was a decent dish and I'd recommend it if you find yourself at salt.  SERVICE: The service was actually terrible this time.   The waiter was forceful about where to sit (we had a large group and a few tables.)   Ultimately, a lot of people looking to catch up weren't sitting together.     Second, he told us because we were in such a large group that if we wanted the food to come out together, each table had to fully order at one time - something we were planning to do anyways.   Nevertheless, we did do what he suggested, and the food came out 1 plate at a time, over the course of 30-40 minutes.     Food ** Ambiance **1/2 Service 1/2* (out of ****)  If you're in the area and Libretto is busy, go to the casual old school Lakeview Diner on Dundas, just east of Ossington.    Cheap, unpretentious, great service, and the food is alright."}
