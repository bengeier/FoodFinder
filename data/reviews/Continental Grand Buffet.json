{"text":"food is amazing and fresh fridays and Saturdays.... wouldn't go mon to Thursday ... also found hosting small parties in their banquet rooms a really nice experience.."}
{"text":"So, an update after sometime.. This place has gone down spectacularly in quality. 12 of us got sick today eating there. They probably recycle food from way back when and the service is no short of horrible ( We had to share napkins at one point..yes) 
Too bad, place showed a lot of promise in the beginning."}
{"text":"The food was good. There was a lot of variety of foods. The favorites were Chicken Makhani & Ice cream."}
{"text":"Stop!! This place is the worse place to eat because it's the dirtiest, disgusting, and unsafe/unhealthy food that is being serve here. Their food is so old from sitting around for too much time that it's dangerous to eat because my whole family got sick from food poisoning. Please take your family else where if you care about their health and safety. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I dropped by on a Saturday for dinner which is a busy time for any restaurant including this one.

It seemed pleasant as I walked in and things appeared to be well organized. I was seated very briskly because being a buffet, there was obviously a lot of space.

At first glance, things looked good because of all the different choices of food offered. A small appetizer section, an Indian food section, a Hakka section, an Arabic section, a desert section and a fruit section seemed to make this restaurant a holy grail for those seeking different cuisines under one roof.

The problem arises when you actually taste this food which by surprise is gravely disappointing. Although there are a lot of options, the food is hardly edible, with the exception of one or two dishes.

The service is not much better. The finished plates are left on the tables for far too long. The clean plates became scarce after about half an hour of dinner time. They entirely ran out of desert spoons. There was more than once I wanted to try something but no one had filled the empty dishes. Our server had an attitude and took forever to bring our desired drinks. She was visibly annoyed when everyone wanted drinks. Things also got quite dirty near the serving area.

Overall it was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place today in a party of 10, and have to say that it was a horrible experience. The buffet was 27.99 which would be fine if the quality was high, but instead, everything from presentation, service, selection, and quality was bad. All the BBQ is behind a station and is rationed, you are allowed only one piece at a time. Pop has to be bought for and the meal paid for before eating. Want another drink during your meal? Well you better leave your table and go to the entrance to pay for servers can't take orders or accept money. For a $28 buffet, they had two ice cream flavours only in the dessert. 

Maybe I've been spoilt by Mandarin and such buffets, but these guys really need to step it up."}
{"text":"After reading yelp reviews, we almost decided to change the venue of our family get-together. Imagine spending for 20 people and then instead of hearing thank yous we hear food complaints. BUT we had no choice! None of the other indian buffet restaurants were reservations for large group because of Diwali weekend. 

As we entered the place, I was like 'this place looks great'. I was literally praying for the food to be nice too because I was the one who selected this place! 

The food wasn't downright delicious (as per Karachi standard) but it was better than other places. Live bar-b-que was good and desserts were good too. Like everywhere else, not all dishes were great but 90% of them were and Im quite happy! My fav were Kofta Kabab Curry, Bhiryani, Seekh Kebab, Qorma, and gajar ka halwa.

Try this place and I'm sure you wont regret it.

PS: I dont work here nor do I have any connections with the owner!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place a 2, is the shock factor for the entrance. It looks like you're at some high end, buffet that makes you wonder if you can afford to even eat here. Beautiful desks, glass, a fountain in the middle, etc.  Annddd then they take you to your seat...

The carpet was dirty, the seats uncomfortable, the dishes/cups dollarama quality...but I'm here to eat so I ignore it and go to the buffet. I really only came here because a flyer came in the mail advertising this place, which serves hakka, Pakistani, Canadian, Indian , etc. I should have figured that any place that serves almost every nationality is going to suck, let alone them advertising a \"grand opening discount\" when it opened 6 months ago. 

The food tastes like it was there for hoursss - which makes sense since we walked in at 7pm being the only party of 3 there. At dinner. At a buffet. So you could imagine how awkward that felt. I went around and could tell nothing looked delicious, so I mostly stuck to the Indian food since everyone who worked there was Indian, so i assumed it'd be the best. And it was, but that doesn't say much. The Canadian food was onion rings and chicken nuggets, which both were stall. Walking past the fruits to get back to my table, they were browning...if I wasn't such a nice guy, I would have left. 

The service was friendly, I'll give them that, but I'm not there for service at a buffet. I already have to get up and serve myself so I'm not really looking for that. The owner came by twice to see if everything was going alright, and we just said it was good and let him walk away. I guess everyone really is a liar. 

This place has so much potential, but it just fails to do much with what its working with. I don't assume it will last much longer either as I sure won't be coming back. I'd avoid, unless you're a new restaurant owner and want to see what NOT to be like.
Overall, I should have gone to Mcdonalds for my birthday"}
{"text":"Worked here food is alright. The staff is limited so it's hard to manage the rooms especially the big ones.  Usually 2 waiters/waitresses are assigned to the big halls and 1 person is assigned to the smaller rooms. So the quality of service depends on how packed the place is."}
{"text":"Please don't go there this place is not good for lunch nd diner too too bad food. salt is over in all dishes if u want eat fried fried wings so u can go other wise this place is terrible no verities of food and sweet dish I just wasted my money yesterday"}
{"text":"We selected this place for our annual dinner , there were no names or description on dishes and we find food spicy , even for ones who loves spicy food shrimps were only savers for us .desserts need more attention.Ambiance wasn't too great and music will make you sad :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday, not so great. Not very clean. It needs a face lift.  Food was average, you were only allowed one kebab at a time. terrible service.  The mussels and shrimp looked like they were there for many days.  They ran out of pop(coke to be exact). I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Terrible.

The restaurant tries to be everything yet good at nothing. Jack of all trades master of none. 

So you a have pizza, fries, salad, shawarma, biryani, butter chicken, chow mein, steak and more ... see where I'm going with this. It would have been great if the food tasted well... but it doesn't. 

Customer service is terrible. 

Also get some ventilation going. I should not have to smell like bihari kebaba while walking out of the restaurant. Get a better exhaust system."}
{"text":"No idea why this has such an average rating because I ate here on New Years Eve with 8 of my friends. We had a great time and the food was finger lickin' good. Some of the items were better than others, of course. The Lamb Qorma, for example, and the Bihari boti along with the rest of the BBQ'd items (tikka, kabab) etc. 

The waitresses provided exceptional service, frequently checking in at our table to see if we needed more water or wanted the dishes taken away so we could get new, clean ones. 

You do have to wait to be seated at the entrance. We expected a long wait but thankfully only had to do so for about 6 mins.

I've given it a 4/5 because they do not reserve tables for a group of less than 15 people. This I found to be odd because our group of 8 people almost took up an entire table. So it would've been nice to book a table in advance. However, given the service provided, considering that it was New Years Eve, we were all pleased."}
{"text":"I was there with my family on a long weekend so it was quite busy. I was aware that it would be busy so we didn't mind waiting in life to get a table for a big group. The door person wrote our name down and it was a bit of a wait but we were up next... but I see this guy who came later then us went inside talked to the manager to get seats before us and that was not good at all we were with kids and they were getting cranky.

The whole place was not managed well, ok we got a seat. They were not ready for the big group the food kept finishing up. This place is a buffet and the food was too blend but that what you except. 

Over all the place wasn't worth the price and the service at the door was not good. Our server  cleaning the table tried her best but it was too busy for her alone to manage a big section where we seat down. 

The food here is halal."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews  had iftaar here yesterday and the quality and the quantity of the food was excellent . the buffet was well stocked and the food was excellent I tried pretty much everything which was a lot of food . It's mid morning and I'm still stuffed.  The buffet featured a plethora of iftari items , Indo Chinese cuisine , Pakistani food , BBQ and lots of sweets . Coming from the US I would absolutely come back here again"}
{"text":"DO NOT eat there. Customer service, hygiene and food is DISGUSTING. I went there for my mom's birthday and it was such a big disappointment. We struggled to find a CLEAN plate. They were all greasy and some had stuck on food. The buffet looked varied and delicious but deceiving. Everything was greasy and visibly not fresh. Don't waste your money or time there. Go to Mandarin for a similar price."}
{"text":"This was by far my worse experience at this restaurant. Previously, their food had always been OK;however this time the food not only tasted bad, it was disgusting! I was there with a group of 35+ people and was totally thrown off with the food and the customer service. Their so called Grand Buffet was half empty and some were just filled with fast food items like fries, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. There was no salad, barely any deserts and most of their buffet dishes were empty.  Some traditional items like chicken Karachi, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, fried fish, beef curry were completely missing. The food that was being served didn't taste fresh at all, and the halwa smelled like it was made with rotten milk. I called the manager to complain. This is tall Pakistani women in traditional Pakistani outfit. She was terribly rude and didn't address my issue or listened to what I had to say. Instead, she just grabbed my plate and took off. She had no courtesy to say anything or apologize. Absolutely horrible customer service with really bad food. The owner and the manager are both ignorant and disrespectful and charging people really high price for such garbage food. This was on the day of Eid, when everything should have been outstanding.  It's absolutely wrong to charge people such high price and serve them this kind of food. Please don't waste your money going there, because this place is not worth your money at all!"}
{"text":"This places food quality and hygiene has gone down tremendously. I've been there frequently since it's opened for different occasions. They have a strategy where they don't fill up the food trays frequently that way customers are forced to fill up in things like onion rings and fries which are always ready and available. Only one red meat dish on the whole buffet last night. Wow one!! They had fish and chicken dishes. When we saw the hidden kabob and chicken stand there was a guy serving it and he literally put half a bite in each persons plate. Don't was your money there are excellent buffets out there this place sucks!!!! Very sad !! Oh and they ran out of dessert too we had to ask several times and they finally brought out quarter trays and acted like they were doing us a favor lol omg!!! Please close down so people don't get tricked into trying your horrible place. You guys think people are fools and don't know your games."}
{"text":"Not much impressed.  I was treated out to this place thanks to my friends, IDK if I would visit again.  Love the fact it's buffet, Halal, and mix of Indian/Pakistani, Chinese, and Mediterranean food.  I wish it had some order, it was way over packed for the seating available, not everything looked fresh.  From Indian dishes I loved Haleem, Lentil, and Chaat.  From BBQ loved the chicken, From Chinese, Sweet and sour Chicken, and the Fried rice. From Desert Gulab Jaman, and Halwa.  The food at the end of the day made us very thirsty, that tells me they used alot of Magnesium Salt.  You eat less and feel full faster.  From the prices I was told I would not visit this place with the family of 6.  it will cost us like $200, which is WAY over priced."}
{"text":"Food was AWSOME, such a big variety! BUT the place that we sat at was not a 5 star! Otherwise it's good"}
{"text":"The concept here is pretty appealing -- a little taste of everything from around the world.  Sadly I've  been to this place twice and each time amazed at what is being passed off as food. Virtually everything on offer is poorly made and seems days old (discolored, rubbery).  You're not missing anything if you give this a pass."}
{"text":"Let start by saying i have not given any place a 1 star, i gave this place 1 star because i have to, there is nothing less than a *.

We had a dis-pleasure of going to this place in Mid October, i had been here once before and did not think much of the place back than.

This is a place which mostly offers Indian/Pakistani, Hakka Chinese & middle eastern food.

You enter into a restaurant and you say wow this is a really nice restaurant (caution don't be fooled). We were seated glasses on the table were mostly clean but one had a dried lipstick stain on it.

Now for the food, very tasteless and blend, seemed dishes were cooked long time ago so were not fresh nothing looked fresh with the exception of fried stuff and Chinese rice.

They had problem keeping the serving plates stocked, they kept on running out of food and people had to make several trips to get a one serving (This is the same problem we encountered when we went last time). When i complained i was told that everyone is going at the same time and people should be behave and give some time let others get what they want let us fill up and then others should go (this is what i got out of their logic and told them that this is a buffet and they should be prepared for this situation)

this place in my opinion is not good at all, save you money go to subway and enjoy your food."}
{"text":"We came for Eid brunch and our crowd was a decent size so we had a room to ourselves. That was the only good thing about this place. The place is nice and clean. The service was ok. The manager was however very rude. Now to the food. 
Everyone, and i mean everyone in our party of 15 adults and 14 kids, did not like the food. 
Some of the fruits had gone bad and it stunk. 
The fountain machine was not working so the owner/manager brought us 2 litre pop bottles from the nearby grocery store, which we understand can happen, but he made a big deal about it like he was doing us a huge favour. 
But the food was not worth it. Lack of taste on majority of the dishes. 
Will not be going there again....ever."}
{"text":"Clean, good food, and a lot of variety.

They have an interesting set up where there are different seating rooms aside from the main buffet which is great because it keeps noise contained.

The options are mostly indian, american, a little asian and some arab/persian food like kebabs. I must say that the Indian food was not spicy at all, which is a good thing because spicy food can scare away a lot of people who are not used to it.

Examples of food you can get there include: butter chicken, palak paneer, lamb karahi, pani puri, chicken wings, crappy tiny thin pizza with no sauce, fries, onion rings, chilli chicken, chow mein, hot n sour soup, spring rolls, chicken and beef kebabs.  Plus way more!

The dessert options were basic; ice cream, lame sheet cake, and a few indian sweets.

The wait staff was helpful and came by our table regularly to clear plates and bring water as needed.

The price for the weekend was like $21.00+ per person and apparently we got like 20% off for seniors, which is great!

The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because they need more Chinese and American options. It's basically a Indian buffet. I also didn't rate it a 5 because the North American dessert options included only two cakes and some ice cream and fruits. If you're not a fan of indian desserts, your options are minimal.

I would recommend it! I took lots of pics for you. I hope its helpful for you ro make a decision to come here. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know that you had to pay up front before you eat ask the person why he just said policy ask him alot of cx dining & dashing he didn't respond to question. Also there where no labels of food items. Probably won't be visiting again unless forced to eat there by Charles ingalls"}
{"text":"Come on the weekend! A lot of the times places this big and buffet style have the best and fresh foods on the weekends. That's when they have most of their business. This place for brunch is amazing! Their brunch goes from 1130am til 3pm and it has everything you want/need. 

Continental - they have Chinese, Arab, and indian/pakistani foods. So much variety for the price and for brunch is just amazing. 

They also have 2 banquet halls within their facility for larger gatherings. 

Definitely a must go!!"}
{"text":"First impression led me to belive that this restaurant would be good. The location is convenient with lots of free parking, however the pictures advertised on the front of the restaurant do not reflect what is in the restaurant. 

The food was stale, tables and chairs dirty. A woman found a large bug in one of the rice dishes. Not many choices although it states over 100 items, food is not authentic Indian. 

The only good thing was that the server was polite, but its pretty much self service. Save your money, go to any of the restaurants in Albion and Islington in Etobicoke for some delicious, authentic Indian food!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service i have ever encountered in my life at any restaurant. The manager was rude and the owner was out right abusive. I am a federal employee and i have a long history of experience in customer service and the way i was treated has set me off from this restaurant for life. I am well aware of customer service standards I have worked in a customer service role for the past 9 years of my life and i can say that frankly the owner has no idea what customer service means. I was attending a small wedding celebration today for my cousins wedding and I am invited to another reception from the grooms side tomorrow at this restaurant but I will not be attending tomorrows festivities because of the horrible customer service standard displayed by the owner. The thing i found most disturbing was that the owner is a friend of a close friend of ours and that is why the event was being held at this location but if he is treating his friends friends this way i hate to think how he would treat other customers. We were refused food, told we could not go near the buffet untill the host showed up even though we were part of the hosts as it was our side throwing a party for the grooms family. Then when the bride's father showed up the owner refused to let him go near the food saying no one could start eating untill 80% of the guests had arrived. We all felt like the owner was completely unreasonable and had no idea what customer service means. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Avoid it if you don't want to be abused by the trashy owner. 

I will not be returning to this restaurant and no one else should either. Sadly the bride and groom have a paid reservation so they cant cancel the event.

I don't usually write comments of give feedback on yelp but the owner of this restaurant was extremely unprofessional and abusive in the way he treated us. I am writing this as a heads up to anyone else who might be considering going to this restaurant."}
