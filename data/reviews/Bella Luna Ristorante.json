{"text":"The best Italian Restaurant in the valley by far! The best food, the best service, the best prices. I ordered the VEAL Parmigiana and it was very tasty, tender and prepared the way it should be - Authentic Italian to the bone! I also ordered the soup of the day - Clam chowder and it was absolutely superb. You cannot do better for Italian food anywhere. Sorry, does not get any better than here. I intend to go back and bring as many people as I can with me. Great dining experience. A \"must try\" restaurant, by all means."}
{"text":"Went this evening for dinner based on the Yelp reviews. I had the fettuccini alfredo and my wife had the penne pasta with vegetables.  Both were very good as well as the caprese appetizer.    The salads were tasty and the bread was served warm. They certainly serve plenty of food, neither of us could come close to finishing our meals.  The service was fast, efficient and friendly.   Would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for good Italian food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I was stunned by the quality of the veal chop with apple glaze.  Tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly and beautifully presented with wild rice and arranged asparagus.  House wines by the glass were a good accompaniment.  The Tiramisu was one of the best I've had.  Service was attentive, and sitting outside on the patio on a warm fall evening made for nice ambiance.  Two of us with wine and one dessert was $75, so a good value as well.  My best meal on this trip--wish we had a Italian restaurant like this close to home."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were visiing the West Valley for family business and sorely needed a nice night out and some good food. Based on the Yelp reviews and our  geographic location we decided to try Bella Luna. Things started out okay which earned them one of the two stars in this review. We were promptly greeted (although it was quite early - maybe 5 or 5:30?) and seated at a window table allowing us a view of the strip mall parking lot (ugh). The ambiance is a bit ghastly, colors leftover from some 80's idea of country Italian - lots of purple and green. Okay so maybe I'm being generous for giving them one star but we didn't turn around and leave at this point. Our waiter was pleasant enough, a gentleman who may or may not be the real thing Italian, however we were immediately overwhelmed by his aftershave!!!!Aaaaaaaack - eau de Old Spice.Seriously, I've never had someone serving in a restaurant smell so strong of perfume - ever! We ordered a much needed bottle of wine and were also brought the bread basket. I agree with another Yelper that it was dry and squished and there were only three pieces in the entire basket - it was never refilled, probably a good thing. We ordered the Antipasto Misto and big surprise....it was all from a can....about ten leaves from a canned artichoke, canned eggplant goo, canned red bell pepper strips, a couple of pieces of cheese and some dry meat product. Things were not looking real good.......but salads were okay, good size and well dressed, but nothing special. Entrees were goopy, crowded on the plate, and not identifiable - I think I ordered a sauted white fish with lemon sauce, can't remember what my daughter had. We waited and waited for our waiter and ordered desert (I don't k now, maybe I'm a masochist?). Got tiramisu and it was dry, off-tasting, possibly frozen and rethawed.  Waited a really long time for our check and by this time all I could really taste was the overpowering aftershave from our waiter. I cannot say anything good about this place but we ate the food (giving a second star as it was food and we didn't get ill) and am so sorry that there are not better eateries in the West Valley. We tried."}
{"text":"We used to love this place...awesome to go with friends, share a few bottles of red..and then....we went with friends and we each had a gift certificate.  When it was time to pay our separate bills, they wouldn't accept both certificates...these were not % off coupons...I asked asked why because  if went separately, and there was a couple on the other side of the place also with a gift certificate, the restaurant would wind up with the exactly the same income as they would if both couples sat together.  The result is that we won't go back there if we can't sit with friends at our table and each party use their gift certificate...makes no sense."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner we are from New York and just moved to the area. Its hard to get my husband to eat out here because he always rather me cook! Good to know I will be getting a night off from cooking for now on! We couldn't stop eating! We had Calamari Fritti for our apps I had the *Shrimp Marsala* and if I could scream at you and tell you to eat this dish I would!! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! My husband had the *Surf and Turf* special which is Filet and Shrimp with butternut squash ravoili in a  pesto rosa sauce and baked asparagus!! I tried a bite and the filet mignon was so tender and PERFECT! We ended our meal with the family Tiramisu which was so creamy and outstanding! We will be here once a week!! Go here you will fall in LOVVE! I promise!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times. The first time was really good, but the second was very boring flavored. I had some lemon chicken that was mediocre.    For the price,  the last time turned me off, but will probably go back again."}
{"text":"We arrived after 2 pm., wanted a leisurely lunch.  There was 1 server and she was also hosting.  When we asked what the special were for lunch she said she did not know but would check with the chef.  Server did not provide us with a wine or beer list (we did not ask for one) my husband asked about the beers, she said she really didn't know about beers but they had some Italian beers.  I had veal marsala, very tender, I am not a big eater but would have liked a more veal on my plate.  Everyone else were satisfied with their entrees."}
{"text":"terrible ... way too dirty for me to eat here..didn't order once I saw all the dead flies..find another place.."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!  The squash ravioli is outstanding and they have a great selection of wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"This little restaurant  is truly a gem!  Our dinner was wonderfully delicious.  The service was great.  We have had lunch there too and it is great value for your money.. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight. What a great place. Service was wonderful. The food AMAZING.  The best veal piccata. My husband had the chicken fettuccini alfredo and he loved it. Very nice and creamy. Very nice wine list. We loved it and cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was in the area, looking for good, casual Italian. This place was perfect...great service (the recommendations for wine & dishes were spot on!), comfortable & reasoably priced.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food here was good I throughly enjoyed my stay here. I couldn't get enough of the lamp chops and the clam chowder was very creamy and delicious. And the bread pudding was so so good best dessert around."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for over a decade at least.  I don't know what anyone is talking about the owners being rude.  The sweetest lady I've ever met with her children run the place and they have the best Mint Lamp chops, Garlic Filet Mignon, Chicken Marsala, and NUMBER ! that I've found in AZ cannoli's/filling.  I've never had bad service or food here.  I highly recommend, not sure why other people have had issue.... all these years never have been unhappy with there food or service.  Love the bread and olive oil balsamic as well...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice and friendly staff, food had good portions 1/2 wine during happy hour"}
{"text":"Pasta sauce had no flavor on either of our dishes. My Chardonnay tasted watered down and I didn't finish it.  My husband's dish really wasn't any better.  I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone who actually likes good Italian."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. They've done a phenomenal job of taking a boring strip-mall space and making it very quaint...Service was excellent, and WAY beyond what I expected.  However, the food is totally average. I wasn't sure if the bread had been toasted or was just dried out. Not a good sign. I ordered lasagna, the partner ordered Fettucine Alfredo with Pancetta and Peas. The lasagna was okay, but extremely soft. Not that I want the noodles crunchy, but I do like it al dente. This would have fit in perfectly in a senior home...you could eat it without teeth. Partner's dish was only slightly better. I think the best part of his dish was the delicious crisp peas! mmm...! But the pasta, sauce, and pancetta was just so-so. If I was with someone who REALLY wanted to go there, I would go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Had a early Valentine's dinner. Very nice place to have a quiet dinner. Food was amazing.."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of Bella Luna, It is where we go for our date nights. The service, staff and of course the food are all phenomenal!!!   I had the \"Surf and turf Italian\" It consisted of grilled shrimp and Filet Mignon covered with a pesto sauce. I was able to cut the Filet with my FORK. The same could be said for my wife who had the Veal Piccata. It was probably the best Italian meal we've had in a long time.   The Tiramisu all I can say is WOW!!! One of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant for the first time tonight.  We heard the food was very good.  Well, I can tell you that the food was excellent. The food was fresh, great ingredients, and the portions were large. I was impressed with the ambience as well.  The only reason I gave this place a 3 STAR was that the service was sub par to the price you pay for the food.  I have had better service at Olive Garden.  Granted, our waitress was friendly.  Although we pretty much had to ask for everything.  These are basic things that a server should already cover when taking an order and be providing during dinner.  The entrees come with soup or salad.  She didn't offer either, nor even said what the soup of the day was.  We also had to ask what dressings were offered with the salad.  We also had to ask what Specials were being offered.  We had to ask for bread and additional bread during dinner.  We had to ask for more water and tea several times.  Our entrees came literally right after our salads were served.  The server then took my salad away, as the other server set the entree down, when I wasn't even finished yet. To be fair, our server did ask us if we would like any dessert at the end of the meal.  Although the service could have been a lot better, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"My date and I both had meals here and it was eh on service and food. I was hoping for it to be better as it's a family owned restaurant but it was not meant to be"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is some of the best. Save room for the chocolate Kaluha mousse pie it's the best!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for Valentine's Day this year. We were pretty disappointed in the quality of the food. They had a special valentine's menu (so I can't speak for the regular menu). I ordered veal parmasan, and there was more breading and cheese than veal. It didn't seem like the chefs knew how to make Italian food. Even the bread was bland. The food was over priced for the quality.  The wait staff was very pleasant and the ambience was average.   I may give them a second shot if I'm craving Italian, but, I'm not rushing there."}
{"text":"This place is a total gem. The food is just amazing! The dessert to die for. I was so happy to find this place. Our waiter was great, just enough attention. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the bar area is very close to the dinning area, there was a group of people being very loud at the bar which was kind of killing the mood. It's hard to completely enjoy yourself when someone is shouting about a sports game going on. Other than that everything was just perfect."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations here for mother's day brunch.  We have been wanting to try Bella Luna for several months and were looking forward to a delicious meal after church today.  We really wanted to love this restaurant - it is close, quaint, and not a chain restaurant.  Unfortunately, the meal and the service were both not at all what we expected.  The  brunch menu was extremely limited.   My crepes came out cold - literally, cool to the touch as if they had been sitting out for a long time after they were cooked.  My husband loved his chicken and mushroom crepe, and his meal was nice and warm covered in a sauce that he raved about.  Our son ordered a lentil soup and a pasta dish - when they brought our meals, they had nothing prepared for our son.  We, of course, waited until his meal was prepared before we ate, which took another 10 - 15 minutes.  For mother's day, they offered all of the mom's a single strawberry that had been dipped in chocolate.  Unfortunately, they placed this single strawberry on a hot plate, so the chocolate was melting off of the chilled strawberry.  As much as we wanted to adore this little restaurant, it just was not anything special at all today."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed in this place. The hostess and staff made it very obvious that only \"regulars\" were welcome. After putting our name in we waited 45 minutes to be seated, all the while watching all the regulars who came in after us be seated immediately. After we were seated and ordered we waited about 30 minutes for our food. My friends finally receive their food, and my boyfriend and I were informed that our food was mysteriously given away to another table and we would need to wait another 30 minutes while they made us new food. We nicely declined and left. You couldn't pay me enough money to ever return to this place."}
{"text":"We had the nicest dinner in celebration of our Anniversary.  Richard was the best server ever.  Not only did he suggest how to make our entree selections specific to our tastes; he was friendly and entertained us with a sarenade of yodeling, singing while playing the guitar!  The chicken parm, and seafood pastas and tiramisu were all delicious. We will definately return!  Special Thanks to Richard D."}
{"text":"My wife and I have a home in California and also a home in Litchfield Park. Whenever we are in Arizona, Bella Luna is always on our to dine list. This probably is the best Italian restaurant we have ever dined at. The service is terrific and you can't beat the food. We have had several chicken, veal and eggplant entrees, all are great. We keep comoing back and highly reccomend Bella Luna."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend out to our first date in Phoenix since we have moved here and it was amazing. Our waitress was very friendly and our food was well cooked and came out fresh and made to order. I got the veil and it was super tender and it could be cut with a fork. My girlfriends chicken vodka pasta was a huge portion and very tasty. The house wine was very good and very reasonably priced. The owner was right there greeting us and was very friendly. Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Very very good! Spaghetti and Lasagna for lunch... The lasagna with meat sauce was both bold and flavorful, the portion was well worth the price.  Spaghetti with meatball was equally delicious.  They were out of  Italian sausage or enough for a dish, so I had the meatball instead with a pleasant surprise, the little bit of sausage they did have thrown in for good measure.  The sausage wasn't grainy or fatty and wow the flavor.  We'll be back for sure and did I mention they're doing a Thanksgiving dinner, should be good!!!"}
{"text":"Would give ZERO stars if that was even an option!!! Long story short...came here 3 years ago and had a horrible experience...came here today giving them the benefit of the doubt and yup won't be returning. Nice waiter and that's about it! Our plates that were on the table literally had food particles on it. Received our salad which was a handful of lettuce, a slice of tomato, and drenched/saturated in dressing. At that time we were done...we were asked what they can possibly fix or make our expirence better and I just had no words for them. The so called \"manager\" was sitting at the bar on his lap top (so unprofessional) and there was a little old woman wondering around who was so rude and was like \"ok bye\" (ugh yeah bye bitch) OLIVE GARDEN HERE WE COME! We had amazing food and clean dishes at OLIVE GARDEN! And a REAL salad with condiments IN IT!!!! GO TO OLIVE GARDEN!!!"}
{"text":"Four of us from PebbleCreek visited on Friday night.   Not crowded! Cost was reasonable. Service was excellent.  All enjoyed our meals. We will go again. They should advertise in Pebble Creek paper and offer a discount like other local restaurants. Bet business would increase!"}
{"text":"WOW! My fiancé and I ate here last night and it was amazing!  Atmosphere: Very homey Italian feel when you walk in the door.  Service: Waiter was the best I have had in a long time...very knowledgeable of the menu.   Food: The wine list is probably the best in the west valley especially if you enjoy Chiantis, I had the veal Oscar and my fiancé had the shrimp Bella Luna.  Both were spectacular!   It was such a great evening, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I try to patronize local mom-and-pop stores, so chose this instead of the nearb y Macaroni grill. the bread was great, the pasta was basic italian; not very spicy which is ok - ive had authentic italian in italy, but i frankly prefer the more \"americanized\" versions for the fuller flavor. the service was average, the CD kept skipping and they took forever to fix it which was annoying, and the waitress never asked if i wanted dessert."}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat. There was no waiting-we got right in and our waiter gave us great service, but didn't hover. The food was great. They didn't have the bottle of wine we ordered so they gave us a more expensive one for the cheaper price. Great atmosphere-will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed by this place. The bread, salad, and entrees were all very, very good. The owner and service was very good too."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to having a neighborhood 'go to' restaurant. The kind of place you can go to on a weeknight, or any night for that matter and have a nice drink, good food, relaxed atmosphere...  Not here! I ordered a cosmopolitan before ordering dinner. The waiter brought me back cranberry juice in a martini glass. Upon returning to take our order, I asked if I could have a glass of wine instead. I didn't want to make a big deal about the bad cocktail. He said \"Why? What's wrong with the drink I made you?\"  I replied I did not prefer it, it tasted like straight cranberry juice, and I'd like something else. He immediately copped an attitude and proceeded to tell me he made it correctly. He actually argued with me about it. Really?! Just take the drink and bring the glass of wine... nothing to argue about! So, the salad arrives swimming in what looked to be  a 1/2 a bottle of dressing, which was some lettuce, 1 grape tomato, and one slice of red onion. Sadly dinner wasn't anything to write home about either. Just a piece of white fish with no flavor slapped on a plate. Well, so much for my 'go to' neighborhood restaurant. Won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"I had not planned to even eat at a restaurant as I was going to grocery shop at the supermarket adjacent, but had only been in town for a very busy 36 hrs I was weary and hungry so just was curious.  The nice lady greeted me as I was drawn in by the Sinatra music and calming coolness of the interior.  Although the alfresco dining looked nice, I craved dim and cooler and Sinatra(my fav!). Seated exactly where I would have chosen for myself I immediately received a tall piece icy cold carafe of water that had no cubes or solid ice in it which to me is absolutely the best!  The BREAD WAS PHENOMENAL!!!  Olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the plate and very generous 4 slices for just me put me in heaven.  Salad was fresh, flavorful with creamy Italian dressing I used bread to capture every molecule because it was so delicious.  Chicken Parmesan was the best I ever had because every nuance was executed perfectly leaving chicken moist yet the pounded flattened edges had a crispness I am not sure how they did it truly.  Pasta was super thin, fine while I like a spaghetti style noodle better it needed to be more al dented to my taste, but you cannot have everything.  Reasonably priced.  Professional service.  I am glad I have 13 more weeks in town so I can eat here again!"}
{"text":"Listen, everyone and I am not blown smoke; this family has taken the tomato and turned into a super hero and this superhero's job is celebrating the main ingredients. I don't know how to article how wonderful the sauce is and how it integrates with different items on the menu. Its fantastic! From NYC, LA and Houston. Goodyear Arizona there is a beautiful moon shining at this address; please go and enjoy this amazing reasonably price; home cook ok Italian food. This is living proof that family recipes and cooking is still alive and well. #PRAVO! Freddy Cruz-"}
{"text":"The least satisfying place in Goodyear. Not only did we experience slow service(2hr wait) but the owner (and manager) clearly expressed  no concern that four people in our party specifically ordered gluten free pasta and meals received regular pasta and breaded meats. When we pointed out the time delay and food allergies they replied \" so what is the problem?\"  A lack of concern for their service is obvious."}
{"text":"Good home style Italian!  Nothing too fancy, but solid pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place was the free glass of wine while we waited the better part of an hour WITH a reservation.  Don't take reservations if you can't keep them.  After such a long wait the food was unremarkable.  May try again just in case the kitchen was having a bad night."}
{"text":"An independent restaurant in the far west valley - a rarity. And this one is quite good. It's in the Safeway plaza, but they've done the best you could with a strip mall. There's even a cute patio.  The bread is unremarkable, yet adequate. The salad dressing is good but sometimes they put too much on, so I just order it on the side. The shrimp Marsala is great, the shrimp fra diovala is spicy goodness and the lasagna is a good choice too. My mother in always gets the frutti del mar and is never disappointed. The calamari was served crispy, hot, and tender. Overall the best Italian in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Real Italian restaurant. We went for lunch, and we all had salads. Each salad had fresh crisp greens, and those of us that added chicken or salmon were very happy with the flavor and the way it was cooked. They even offer real anchovies for the Cesar salad."}
{"text":"Great place!! I have been several times for dinner and was always happy with my experience there. I also have a wine group and we have held several events there. This, to me, is where this place shines. Sal and the staff are fantastic. They have treated my group so well every time we go. They put out a great spread of food and the wines have always been perfect. All my members look forward to our repeat visits!! I am already looking forward to going back for another event...Of course, I will be there for dinner in the mean time!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place for our lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised. The service is friendly and prompt. The salmon pasta and lasagna was very tasty and for the price, the portion  was very generous.  Will definitely come again! And they have a military discount!!!"}
{"text":"My family tries to meet here every week for lunch or dinner because it is a small family owned place. The food is cooked after you order and it is quite Devine! Everything we have ordered there measures up quite well, especially the tiramisu which is by far the best ever!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here tonight after being turned down at a different Italian restaurant for being unwilling to accommodate our vegan diet.  When walking in to this place we were greeted by the two owners; to say they went out of their way was an understatement.   They made sure the kitchen made a special item that we could both enjoy.   Our meal was delicious and very reasonably priced.   We will make this our new frequent spot."}
{"text":"Quite good especially for the area.  The veal piccata is very good.  Just the right amount of lemon and capers.  Capers have a great smoky salty taste and just set the whole dish off perfectly.  Lunch is a great deal too.  Yeah...this is probably the best place to go over in the litchfield park area...at least so far."}
{"text":"A waitress, Daniella, was VERY rude to a friend and I when we went at an off-peak hour. We went in for appetizers and dessert. She asked \"you're only here for that??\" Then later when we asked about dessert menu options she reviewed the options, and snubbed us for asking what flavor the bread pudding was. Yes, Daniella, there ARE many flavors of bread pudding......... she didn't bring the coffee that was ordered. Basically she acted as if she was annoyed by having to serve us, sorry we came in to dine at your place of business. Although my friend swears this place is good and the owners are sweet, I can guarantee I won't be back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes.....was terribly disappointed with everything.....bread was store bought, skimpy salad, veal Marsala was nothing special, small pile of wimpy pasta served with blah sauce.... Don't bother!!! Overpriced on top of a unimpressive meal!!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is one of our clients, but we're pretty snobby when it comes to food and wine, so the review would be bad if the food and wine were bad. They weren't! The food was amazing, and a great wine list to compliment it. Plus the decor alone is worth going there for, Highly recommended for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Decided to try someplace new a couple nights ago. My husband and I who are in our early 30s were the youngest people there by far for the first half our meal then a couple other groups came in. The majority of the diners were still probably over 60. The decor was a little outdated, food was good but nothing we had was worth coming back for. Service was good."}
{"text":"Jesse and I had a lovely evening out- we had great dishes and the owner was our server as well. He belts out a lovely Italian birthday song while playing the guitar. Very nice"}
{"text":"Not great.  Our food took forever and the service was less than stellar, for the price.  This place is way too expensive.  I would much rather drop my money at Wigwam or some other upscale place and be able to enjoy a more romantic ambiance."}
{"text":"We have dined here previously at least four times.  It's a 35 min drive for us and we were disappointed last night.  Service was very  slow.  Perhaps we took a back seat to more regular customers.  Portions seemed smaller.  Food is tasty.  This restaurant needs better servers.  The slow service does allow for lots of good conversation."}
{"text":"Great food great service!  We will definitely be taking family here when they come visit.  The place is kind of small though but it's a nice intimate setting.  I got the baby clams in linguini - lots and lots of garlic which I like but they did have some pretty big chunks in there which I didn't care for too much but my dish definitely tasted yummy.  The hubby had their special of the day which was a pork chop with sweet potato and asparagus.  I had a bite and was jealous of his yummy meal!"}
{"text":"This evening we re-visited this restaurant with an open mind since out last visit. We were welcomed and seated quickly. Our server let us know what the specials were for tonight and brought our drinks quickly. I ALWAYS have a difficult time choosing when there is Eggplant on the menu and wind up going with something tried and true. Our server told me that the Eggplant Parm was a good choice and very tasty so I ordered it. With extra sauce of course and salad :) My other half ordered the Chicken Parm (but he was torn between that and Salmon) . A bread basket was served as well and it was nice . I love the olive oil and balsamic server on the table! The olive oil surrounds the separate container of balsamic in what appear to be a cluster of grapes.  The weather this evening was nice enough for the patio but since it was windy we opted for indoor seating. Several other diners came in and started to fill the place and our food arrived in a reasonable time. The salad was nicely torn and mixed well with dressing , It wasn't a quick squirt either on the lettuce and was blended in well with the tomato. The fresh pepper was a nice touch. The first thing I noticed was it was the food was hot and the eggplant was sliced thin. I've only ever had it served as a thick slice and this was great. Lightly bread and cooked well. It was VERY tasty and the BEST I've had! YUM! I put some of my extra sauce on it because that's my thing.  My husband was quiet on his end and when asked about his dinner he said it was the greatest he's had in Phoenix so far. The only thing he didn't like was the veggies. Let me tell you they were fresh and steamed and not frozen. We were served large stalks of broccoli and a large slice of carrot and to me that is Heaven, to him, hmm not so much. But on the bright side , MORE for me! :) We don't always have dessert so we passed on the tiramisu . Maybe another time. Both of us believe that we must have come on a bad night the last time we were here. The food was tasty, the server was spot on and the experience was very pleasant. The consensus is that we will return again. So much more to try.  As I mentioned on my previous visit, the menu has quite a bit of choices and a pretty good selection of adult drinks if you want with your meal. Next time we hope t0 make it out to the patio before it gets too hot to enjoy an outdoor meal."}
{"text":"When I think of Bella Luna, my mouth starts watering. What's the best?  Everything. I'm torn between the stuffed mushrooms and fried calamari. Same with the dessert - cannoli and tiramisu.  All I can say is try everything and you might have the same issues."}
{"text":"We took our daughters here to celebrate a birthday last week and it was A-W-E-S-O-M-E....        Great Food  Great Service  Great Experience  If you would like to have a great meal at someplace besides a chain restaurant this is this worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Unhappy.  Went here expecting good Italian food.  The food was standard.  We arrived at 5:30 and noticed that they had an \"early bird special\" that ended at 6.  At 5:45 I asked the waiter if we could order and he said \"I'll be back in a minute\".  Back at 5:59, we are informed we are too late for the special.  BAD customer service.  So me and my husband decide to split a dish.  We are informed that will be a $5 fee.  The dish we ordered was so spicy I couldn't eat it and ate off the kids' plates.  We were the youngest people there by a good 20 years and I felt like they made it a point that families weren't welcome."}
{"text":"Went here for a night out with the family. It was very delicious! Our experience at Italian restaurants has been too much garlic in everything. The pasta dishes we had were just perfect! They were good sized portions. We had the farfalle alla vodka, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, shrimp scampi, and lasagna. We started with the stuffed mushrooms. The bread served was very soft and flavorful! The service was fast and pleasant! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was slowwwwwwwwww !!! must of waited 20-25 minutes to get a drink order."}
{"text":"Loved your Pollo alla Parmigiana!!! Great location and beautiful music. Excellent customer service, Kyra did a great job!!!"}
{"text":"I had the veal piccata. It was very rich and full of flavor. You will leave feeling satisfied as it is not for lite eater. The service was great and the food was satisfying. It's is the closest I've had to authentic Italian in a long time."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place by accident, and what a happy accident it was! The food at Bella Luna is consistently great. The single time we ever had the slightest problem with service, the manager personally took over and waited our table for the rest of the night. The owners can often be seen sitting at a table near the door, nibbling, talking, having a glass of wine and making sure everything is running smoothly.   I love the fact that it is a locally-owned family business. Who wants to give their money to a corporation for mediocre food when you can give it to someone's Nana and Pop for a delicious, tastes-like-homemade meal of much higher quality?  In the mood for soup instead of salad with your meal? Ask if they have any of their homemade lentil in the pot. Absolutely delicious.  While I enjoy the warm, cosy atmosphere, some of the tables are a little too close together for my comfort. If you want to avoid the buzzkill of listening to your table neighbor's complaints over being 300% upside down on his Avondale home, you may want to visit on a weeknight when it's less crowded, rather than a busy Friday or Saturday."}

You deserve to have no service, absolutely despicable and I will make sure I spread the word how you wouldn't even meet us outside the Air Force base gate if you didn't want to enter and you still refused... What comes around goes around!"}
{"text":"My first experience of Bella Luna was excellent. They have a great lunch menu and I ordered pasta. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Love the traditional atmosphere and it would be nice for dinner. It's nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood. I will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the west valley for italian. Friendly service, and familiar faces. Food is pretty decent too. Their specials seem to be specials for the long haul or its by chance I just go on the same days the specials are the same as the last time I visited. Be careful of the specials and make sure to ask on price, because sometimes they can run on the north side of 40$+ if your on a budget... Its very nice to have a restaurant thats non-chain and family run. Have been visiting this location for over 5 years now."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Not only is the food absolutely amazing the staff is also amazing. I really enjoy the atmosphere and decor. Food is truly authentic and has great proportions. I recommend and love this place!!"}
{"text":"I have always been here during what would be considered off hours. So I assume this is the reason I rarely get attentive service. But I expect it so it does not bother me. The food is usually pretty good and not far from home so an easy choice. But a lot is opening up around us these days, being more attentive might come in to play soon."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday for a quick glass of wine and an appetizer @ 4:30pm.  Thought they may have a happy hour, but they didn't.  So my husband and I ordered 2 glasses of pinot noir and a shrimp cocktail.  The wine tasted old and the shrimp cocktail consisted of 4 large shrimp with tails (cold) and 2 large shrimp no tails (warm).  Hmmmm....I've never been served warm shrimp for shrimp cocktail....makes me wonder if the two shrimp with no tails were perhaps intended for a different menu item.  The bill was $40.  I don't see us returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Impromptu Sunday evening dinner.  Not very busy.  Good service.  So-so food. Several light bulbs are out, so it's kind of dark and dank inside.  My husband had the chicken parmigiana and I had the pasta primavera.  He said his was good (cleaned the plate).  The pasta primavera was pretty taste-less even after adding parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. The oil and garlic were heavy on the bottom of the bowl, but again just lacked in the taste department.  Definitely wouldn't order that if we go back there again."}
{"text":"Like my family and friends, I too wanted to like this place.  I have been here 3 times, just to be fair.  I like the independently run Trattoria style eateries, and totally shun Olive Garden.  But, truth be told, the food, service, and wine selection here are just.....average & uninspired.  My Pasta Vongole actually came with canned minced clams...how dreadful. Not reccomended."}
{"text":"After my thoroughly negative review I was unexpectedly contacted by AJ the general manager. We spoke for over an hour. I found him to be genuine , honest, concerned , and caring. He wanted to take responsibility for my problem and the restaurant problems with reservations and service. . On Fri 7:15 PM AJ drove 1 hour 15 min from Glendale to our home in Maricopa to bring us our anniversary dinner. The dinner was excellent. We spoke for close to an hour, it was a pleasure meeting him.At this point in my life the gesture says more about the character of the person and the restaurant  and means more than any meal could ever mean. I truly believe that from now on with AJ understanding the problems , they will be no more. He has hired more people and is training the staff to work as a team . AJ is a beautiful caring human being and there a good people around him that need his direction. The cooking is excellent and the menu is also.. The good people who run it just need to show who they are and be themselves. Make everyone who comes in feel like family. Treat them well and they will always want to come back because you made them have a good evening .if you and the customer are happy that's a good thing right?. Well it's so easy?. AJ thanks for being you and making things right. You didn't have to care. But you did. You cared 1000%. You taught me something at 62 yrs old I never knew. It's way better to care about someone 1000% than it is 100%. Everyone needs to practice that, I know I will from now on! Because of your caring , we will be back to BELLA  LUNA and the JAMAICAN chicken dinner will be on us when we do. In life God teaches us when someone does  good for you , you do good for them too. Wish you nothing but success at your restaurant  AJ, I know you'll get it right. You are a good man! If you have had reservation problems in the past or you have had problems with the service in the restaurant I know AJ is going to make sure all his customers are satisfied 100% of the time whenever they come in. AJ wants the restaurants whole  dining experience excellent and the staff totally onboard"}
{"text":"Had the fettucino alfredo and the spahghetti with meatballs. The pasta was fantastic. Same with the taramitsu cake"}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday.  2:00 and the place was empty.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana and a salad.  We got our salads moderately quick.  My salad had a single slice of tomato about the size of a quarter.  When I was almost done with the salad, the waitress brought us bread.  4 small dried out pieces that looked like biscotti.  They looked like leftovers from somebody else.  The entrees came and they could have been better.  The pasta sauce was watery and the cheese was burned on the chicken parmigiana.  My nephews lasagna was not very good either.  The whole time I was never offered refills on my iced tea.  Definitely everything could have been better.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I had my food delivered, so I can't speak to the physical restaurant myself, but some of the reviews on here don't do the food justice.    I started with the Caprese Salad ($7.00).  Everything was beautiful.  The tomatoes were fresh, the mozzarella was freshly made and the basil was still bright green.  In the Spaghetti and meatballs ($13.00), the pasta was al dente (even though it was delivered), the sauce was flavorful and the meatballs were cooked properly.  Lastly, the Italian Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Gelato was amazing.  GrubHub says it's one of the restaurant's most popular dishes, and it is well deserved.  Long story short, let the Olive Garden crowd enjoy their frozen food cooked in microwaves."}
{"text":"I have stopped in here to get take out a few times and finally dined in a few weeks ago.  The gentleman who plays the guitar is possibly one of the nicest waiters I've ever had and is a nice addition to the ambiance.  I tried the pancetta, peas and alfredo and didn't care for their pancetta.  I have enjoyed the fettucini alfredo with chicken multiple times and shared with my toddler who also loves it.  Most of the clientele was older but the staff are mostly young and attractive, so best of all worlds.  I would definitely recommend this place but would not add it to my list of weekly haunts, not because of quality or atmosphere, but simply because my favorite meal there is heavy and I don't eat terribly heavy food all that often.  Fun treat and cozy bar I've had a drink at while waiting for my food."}
{"text":"Owner is from Long Island.. one of the best Italian cuisine you will find. This place is a hidden jem. My wife and I always go here for dinner and will drive all the way from North Phoenix to get there.  EXCELLENT food, service, with the friendliest staff! The veal is to die for. Most Italian places will make a veal patty.. this isn't the way veal should be served. It should be cut and slammed thin. Excellent gravy, excellent food, everything on the menu is amazing. You will not be disappointed. The people who have given this place anything less than 2 stars do not know how real Italian food should taste or be prepared! I will continue going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Good service, good ambiance. Very well decorated place. Food ordered the mussels and clams and they were awesome. Calamari was cooked perfect. Ordered shrimp diavola and it was awesome. Marinara was just spicy enough. One of the best Italian places I've been to. If you want good Italian go here!"}
{"text":"Had the mushroom, calamari and crab cakes for appetizer, all were very tasty. My main dish was the salmon, yum..."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to give this place a try since I LOVE Italian food.   Arrived on a Wednesday evening around 6 pm with my husband.   Ambiance of the place appears to be romantic, exactly what I was looking for with our random date night dinners.   A lovely, elderly woman sat us and told us to enjoy.   Our server was a sweetheart and was on top of our table the entire time.   Here is how our order played out:  Two ice teas Garlic bread was really good.  Shrimp cocktail appetizer (hubby said was really good)  Salads with creamy Italian dressing (wasn't creamy and was really tart & tangy)  My order: Spaghetti and meatballs (my sauce was way too sweet, I had to ask for garlic powder and their house seasoning to bring the sweetness down)  Hubby's order: Primavera (Hubby said it was delicious)   Bill came out to around $44 ish and $54 after tip.   We will give them another try since we do not like to judge a place only on 1 visit."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I'm not very impressed.  The service is slow and even when there is clearly no one else in the restaurant.  The food wasn't much better, it was ok, but a bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is horrible. Don't bother making reservations because it doesn't matter. They won't reserve a table for your whole party, they will split you up and seat you as a table becomes available. We had to keep asking for water and bread because they would bring 1 bottle of water for our table of 6 and a basket of bread with 4 pieces. Also, 1/2 our tables food came and then the rest took another 10 minutes. Take-out might be a better option, then you would at least know your whole party could eat together and at the same time."}
{"text":"Both service and food were well below average.  We were genuinely hoping we would love this since it is a local restaurant.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning after this experience."}
{"text":"Almost a 5 star, very close, very close. Stopped by the other night for a quick dinner before an event. Seated right away with smiles and greeting. Menu was nice, variety of dishes. Choose Mozzarella Pomadoro to start with and it was very good, love the fresh basil. That set me right up for Aglio e Olgio a nice pasta with garlic, olive oil and parsley , I added chicken to top it off. Very tasty and just what I wanted. Would have liked to make it a bit spicy, but it would have taken away from the overall dish. I enjoyed my meal and will return to sample the menu some more. Looks like a great place for a small dinner for two or a place where a bigger party could enjoy themselves. Prices was about right for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Bella Luna is an unassuming Italian eatery in the West Valley.  The restraunt is inviting, the staff is accomdating, and the food is good.   On this visit we shared a Cesar Salad, Chicken Parmesan, and lasanga. The Caesar salad is made from scratch and the chicken parmesan and lasagna were all are good.  We shared a dessert of Italian bread pudding.  The service was excellent, however, the recorded music was a bit loud for such a small place."}
{"text":"Stopped here after visiting the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium.   A friend and I were driving down Litchfield Road looking for some place to eat and I saw it out of the corner of my eye. My friend was like, \"Hey, why not....\" and into the parking lot she turned.   Like other people have said it's not the most spectacular looking place from the street...plopped at the end of a shopping center. I wasn't expecting much....but it kind of turned out like a Susan Boyle.....that whole judging a book by it's cover thing.   Service was prompt and attentive. It's a small place and it didn't seem too busy. We sat on the patio and I have to say that parking lot is the QUIETEST parking lot of any shopping center I've ever been in. Very relaxing.   Like I said, I wasn't expecting much and wasn't sure what to order. I was torn between a few things and ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo. As soon as I ordered it I was like, \"Ugh...why did I order that?\" It's just sometimes a restaurant will make a fettuccine alfredo that just leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. Don't know if it's the cheese they use or what. So, like I said, I was dreading it. That whole Susan Boyle thing I alluded to earlier.   Started with some bread and a small salad with a creamy Italian dressing. Pretty good.   Then out came my fettuccine alfredo. It looked good....and it smelled good. And I have to admit it was the BEST fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. Creamy, rich, and oh so good. I was SO happy I ordered it.   We ended with a creme carmel for dessert which was just right to top off our dinner.   After dinner went inside to use the restroom and the restaurant was even smaller inside than I thought.   Chatted a bit with one of the employees about the restaurant and the owners. Very friendly and warm atmosphere.   I don't get out that way much but if I'm around there again I will definitely stop in again. Thanks, Bella Luna, for surprising me with a great dinner.   Moral of the review: Don't judge a book by it's cover....a singer by the way she looks....or a restaurant by it's location. Really. Don't."}
{"text":"our party of two had arrived fairly late for dinner (at least in these parts) at 745p.m.  we were told there would be about a 15 minute wait which seemed reasonable.  another party with 8pm reservations arrived shortly thereafter and were also told there would be wait as well.  we sat at the bar to be were ignored by the bartender, a lady whom seemed to be the owner and about 15 minutes later, finally the host who was also working behind the bar asked if we wanted a drink.  we finally did get seated about half hr later in their really noisy dining room.  it was a little confusing since it seemed as if every server on that side of the dining room stopped by but no one server seemed to be taking care of us primarily.  there was a larger party who waited so long for their food that we felt badly for them.  our appetizer of stuffed mushrooms were plain and tasteless.  the entrees arrived but they were not worth the wait.  my \"spicy\" fra diavolo tasted like plain marinara.  friend's veal piccata smelled good but didn't taste spectacular either.    all in all, will not return.  that was two hours that we will never get back..."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I suggest going somewhere else to eat Italian food in Goodyear like Dino's.  My wife and I had eaten there several times and had so so service and food quality.  We had a party for a friend where we invited people to come and eat and when everyone came (about 15 people) we ordered appetizers and then everyone ordered separately.  When the time for the checks to come the server notified us that they were going to charge us $25 a persone.  Some of the people and shared plates and no one ordered any alcohol.  None of this was communicated to us prior to this event.  We should have called the cops but we didn't, this I regret.  I have never even heard of a place doing something so idiotic.  Our friend and I picked up the tab.  So now I tell everyone to avoid this place.  Oh and every time I ate there I go a case of diarrhea."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   I had been looking forward to trying this place and was extremely underwhelmed during our visit today.  The ambiance: as mentioned my others, its dark in the restaurant and depending on where you're seated the music can be pretty loud.  Things seemed clean (i didn't use the restroom) but the seating is uncomfortable.  The service: We were seated quickly but from then on the service was scarce and not good at all although the restaurant wasn't that busy.    The food - the bread was cheap and terrible.   My husband enjoyed his garlicky cheese raviolis ($17). I had the fettuccini Alfredo with pancetta and peas ($15).  It was okay.  I really liked the pasta but the sauce reminded me of reheated left-over Alfredo sauce.  To be honest,  I don't have a burning desire to go back and i wouldn't recommend it.  Instead ill stick with Babbo Italian Eatery because their a thousand times better."}
{"text":"By far the worst meal I have ever had.  I just signed up for Yelp to write this review because I had such a poor experience.  I could handle the sub par service for a great meal, but when the food arrived I was shocked.  I won't even touch on the first course because a lot of places have a basic house salad with little flavor.  The main meal though was disgusting.  I had the Salmon Oscar that had absolutely no flavor to it, I can't even explain to you what I was eating.  My daughter got a pasta dish with shrimp & clams where the shrimp was so fishy and over cooked that it was not edible.  I figured the side of pasta with marinara would at least be enough to fill my belly; until the first bite that was yet again flavorless!  This restaurant is overpriced for the lackluster food they are serving.  I will be shocked if they are still in business in 6 months.  If they want to survive they need to actually taste their food and come up with a menu that will encourage repeat business.  So close to my house that I was excited to try, but I will never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We've lived in this area for years but had never tried this restaurant before Friday night. We sat outside because it's so nice. Greeted by the hostess that looked like she had just rolled out of bed.  Our food took forever, over an hour. Never once did he apologize for the long wait, hardly came back to our table to replenish our drinks unless we flagged him down. The food was okay, \"VERY PRICY\" for what you get (small portions). Our friends that were with us got sick that night from the food they ate. Just an all around disappointment! Our server was terrible (Tommy was our server). Won't be back, there are too many good restaurants around to go back to that."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, as always.  Dined on the patio on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  It was pretty slow at that time so the food came out quickly.  However, I think that being the only ones outside made it less convenient for the server to notice when our glasses were empty and we were in need of refills.  Other than that, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 7pm and got there at about 6:40..they seated us right away and we got a nice outdoor table. We were expecting to have to wait since it was Valentine's Day, so it was a nice surprise when we got seated immediately. The service was REALLY slow..which I won't hold against them since it was a holiday. The food was good..not outstanding, which I expected when paying $22 for a dish. I got a salmon dish and it was luke warm..definitely not hot. Still tasted great though. The pasta with sauce that was on the side was boring, same with the bread. Our server was very nice. I was very disappointed however, when we tipped her over 20% (handed her cash separate from the card we were paying with) and received not even a thank you. Definitely left a sour taste in our mouth."}
{"text":"Dinner with four Hall of Famers sitting around me...Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Joe Morgan and Ken Griffey Sr., not bad, but the food was really good.  A nice surprise on the West Side!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times when I was visiting my inlaws in Arizona. I was pleasantly surprised. The last thing that expected was decent italian food in the middle of the desert. They proved me wrong. The food is comparable to any high end italian place here in NJ. The service is also very good too. I am looking forward to visiting here the next time that I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Bella Luna. I had heard great things and was eager to find an authentic Italian restaurant close to me. I was pretty disappointed. Service: Front desk was very friendly. We were seated right away. Our server was an older gentleman who did not give us his name. We had to flag him down for bread, he never ONCE came over to check on us or ask us how the food was and he was basically not around other than to hand over the food. Atmosphere: fairly busy but not loud. They definitely don't have a lot of air conditioning. It was about 95 outside and we were getting pretty warm inside. Food: Here is the biggest bummer. The food was \"eh\" at best.  The Bruschetta with mozzerella was very disappointing. No real flavor, the bread wasn't even toasted all of the way (so it was rather soft and squishy)and the tomatoes were not fully ripened and chopped so large, it was hard to experience anything but a crunchy tomato. The salad was WAY overdressed, dripping with tons of vinegar. The soup (beef barley) was just blah. Campbells in a can is better.  My husband had the lasagna - He said it was good so that is a plus.  I had the fettucine alfredo with pancetta. The pancetta is the only thing that saved that dish. The noodles were very over cooked (borderline mushy) and the alfredo sauce was very runny and didn't have much flavor. No one offered parm or cracked pepper or anything. It was not the most horrifying meal I have ever experienced, but I have had better ones at the Olive Garden, which to me, is pretty sad."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place to eat or even just relax and enjoy a glass of wine. This has become my new favorite place. Wonderful customer service. Definitely make you feel like family as soon as you walk in the door and the food is absolutely incredible.   The bartender Greg is awesome.  & AJ makes food to die for.  Wouldn't choose to have a relaxing lunch anywhere else."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting this restaurant we were looking to try something new but we're pretty disappointed with our choice. The service was good they were friendly and the presentation of the location is welcoming it seems to be family owned so we were excited because that usually means they pay more attention to the food. I got the shrimp Alfredo and it was very bland, it had absolutely no flavor and some of the shrimp was old and some fresh the old shrimp was like plastic it was so bad. The servers were very sweet but we won't be paying Bella Luna a visit again :-/"}
{"text":"Great family-run Italian restaurant...a diamond in the rough. Hard to find good NON-CHAIN restaurants in the West Valley. This is a rare find. Definitely check it out. Looks like any other strip mall restaurant on the outside, but the ambiance is very nice on the inside, which is also refreshing to find in the West Valley! Have eaten here at least twice now and it's always been great."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great happy hour menu and the food was great. Our server, Greg was very helpful and nice. We had the veal parmagnia and linguini aglio oglio .....very good. I substituted the linguini for gluten free penne.  Check it out....you'll like it."}
{"text":"We finally decided to try Bella Luna for dinner tonight.  We found the restaurant to be quaint and our seating hostess was very pleasant.  After waiting for about 5-6 mins. we were seated and our waiter came over with a warm welcome and menus.  He also was very nice.  After taking our drink orders, he brought over some bread.  Well this is when it went down hill.  Our bread was cold, old and very tasteless.  It honestly did not have any flavor to it.  We soaked it in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar just to get some flavor.  Our waiter came over and took our meal order - I had the Cheese Ravioli in Pesto sauce and decided to upgrade my regular dinner salad with the Gorgonzola Salad for $2 more.  This was a sad sad salad.  It was 3 or 4 green lettuce, some stale croutons and some kind of salty white sauce.  This for $2 more!! My Cheese Ravioli was swimming in Pesto sauce.  My husband who also ordered the Gorgonzola salad and decided on the special trio plate.  A small piece of Lasagna that was soo mushy due to the over cooked lasagna, he couldn't tell what he was eating.  His Alfredo was runny, and something else that had no taste to eat.  My daughter decided on just the Alfredo pasta.  Again, a plate of watering sauce and over cooked pasta.  While my daughter and I had just water, my husband had a glass of Pinot Noir, which was the only good thing he enjoyed.   AND  to top off the entire sad meal, the bill was  $69.  We had high hopes for this restaurant, but we definitely agree that we will never go again."}
{"text":"I love sitting on the back patio with the fire features. The clam chowder is the ideal appetizer. I am extremely picky when it comes to my clam chowder but this one is AMAZING. I loved the butternut squash ravioli but ask for it on the side. It is very thick and almost takes away from the ravioli sweet flavor."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, big mistake.  The nice is decked out nice for a strip-mall but the food just was not happening.  2 stars because the service was excellent.    I got the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken.  The sauce was watery.  Alfredo watery?  Really?  The chicken was a good flavor, but the running sauce just takes away from the chicken.  And the parmesan cheese is on the table not freshly grated.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here last night for a birthday celebration! Myself and a friend had the Diovalo! The first time the plates were brought to our table the pasta in both of our dishes were ice cold the sauce was hot..the waiter took the plates back to the kitchen and returned with our plates a few minutes later the pasta was still cold but we had more hot sauce on top of the cold pasta! He was gone such a short period of time I asked him if the food is microwaved he said it was not. The pasta was still cold but we had waited so long for a food that we decided to just eat it anyway! All I can say about this particular dish is that it tasted fishy and nasty! We called the waiter back he seemed annoyed that we were not happy with our cold fishy tasting dish. He brought menus back to the table practically threw them at us and told us that he would put our orders to the top-of-the-line. The other meals that we ordered were mediocre. I don't expect a free meal (and did not get one) but I do expect decent service, kind people, apologies for having to wait, we got none of this I felt like we were treated poorly for being served a meal that was horrible! The only part of the meal that was good with the wine and the gentleman who came and sang happy birthday to my friend! I would never go back to this restaurant and I would never recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough horrible things about this restaurant. First off the bread was stale and very cheap tasting, I ordered a mojito and the tiny cocktail glass it came in was half full and they obviously didn't know the right ingredients. My sister order the veal saltombucca which was about max 4 ounces, and I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which had about four super thin pieces & both sides of pasta were about 3 bites full. If you want to be a frou frou French restaurant (maybe) that would fly with a small 5 course meal, but not if you are going to pose as an Italian restaurant. I wouldn't come back here again & I certainly WOULD NOT recommend it to any in the area or anyone traveling out of town. She has reviews on the wall saying \"Best in Litchfield Park\" but that was over 15 years ago. When we complained to the owner she was very unapologetic & shirked the blame on the poor Mexican server & the guy in the kitchen both of whom barely spoke English.  She should know as a business owner that if your guests aren't satisfied you have to value the customers point of view. Not sure how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"9/24/2012 Reservation for 6:30 PM. No problem. Wine by the half liter. Salad is very fresh with a light creamy Italian dressing. Poached salmon with risotto was very good although risotto contained a little too much liquid. Chicken picatta was excellent with tangy lemon caper sauce. (Just right consistency) Chicken portion was ample.Plenty of capers. Tiramisu was great, creamy and good chocolate flavor. Will go again and recommend to any one with taste for Italian food. Priced are reasonable . Service is responsive and timely with no attitudes."}
{"text":"I do want to first say that our waitress, Nicole, was wonderfully energetic, spunky, and attentive.   My personal opinion of this place is that at one time it was probably really good. As they proudly have awards displayed out as you walk in from 2007. Unfortunately, it is now sub-par.   I have eaten at Bella Luna on two occasions. The first was with my fiancé and father (who's Italian). He ordered carbonara and LOVED it. I was not impressed with my Bolognese. We did want to give it another shot though as we are contemplating where to have our rehearsal dinner this fall.   My fiancé and I ordered the calamari. It was bland and definitely not seasoned enough. It really felt as if it was just breaded and fried with a sprinkling of parsley on the top. My fiancé ordered the lasagna. As it came out, it looked yummy. When I tasted it, it was over cooked and flavorless. When I asked him if he liked it he said, \"I like the one from Costco better.\" I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with pancetta and peas. Now I do think this dish tasted very good. It was fairly soupy, but overall I was satisfied. We both did have a tummy ache as we left.   Unfortunately we will not be having our rehearsal dinner at Bella Luna as depending on what you order it is a 50/50 on whether you will like it or not.   I do not want to offend anyone in these further comments, but I really think this place is for Robert Irvine in restaurant impossible. He would have a hay day with this place. The decorations are tacky, the table cloths are not ironed (ours still had crumbs on it when we were sat), and the lay out needs work. The kitchen entrance is open to the main dining area and they have to walk through the front door to get to their tables on the patio. I was told to wait as I attempted to enter because a server was coming out to the patio with food. If I hadn't been notified of this, there would have been a collision of sorts for sure."}
{"text":"The last two times we came here with friends. The service was very slow. We had to track down our server to order drink and food.  The bread came out and it seemed as if they bought the bread from the safeway next door it was bland, not fresh. The salad was swimming in dressing and lettuce was partially wilted.   Food finall came out after an hour from ordering,  a steak ordered medium rare was more like medium well, they forgot to season it and it was luke warm. The other three meals were also luke warm and no seasoning.  This place used to rock, not sure we will go back for another try."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place.  So glad we chose Bella Luna.  Had a mixed shellfish dish with a really yummy sauce.  Risotto with garlic shrimp was a little soupy but oh so good!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just had a very tasty lasagna with a very fresh salad, delicious!  The lasagna was firm and the layers of cheese and meat were seasoned nicely, I chomped a few chunks of garlic and onion, like Nona's lasagna! The sauce was also seasoned well.  I was very pleased.    This was my first experience at Bella Luna, next time I will dine in."}
{"text":"Old school fine Italian, with mob classics playing on a loop. Dated decor adds to the offbeat ambience. We tried seafood, veal, and two chicken dishes. The veal was lack luster, very thin mushy slices. The chicken dishes were tasty, one was Chicken Marsala the other a Chicken dish with artichokes. Sides were included in the price. The salad was great. Desserts were pretty good, the favorite was the cannelloni. The house red wine was good and generously poured. We wanted to like this family restaurant, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"A true family operated Italian restaurant.  The food is fresh, freshly made, properly served, with pride. I have been there many times and always been most satisfied. Gene"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. I am visiting Phoenix, and my grandparents took me to this place because they enjoyed it so much. The little restaurant has a comfortable setting.  The staff was friendly, and the food was fantastic. My fiancé had ordered the penne with meat sauce, and she did not complain about the food to the waitress, but the waitress knew she did not excatly like the dish and brought out a new one free of charge to make sure she left full and happy. Great customer service. We recommend this place and will be returning."}
{"text":"Attending the Best of Success 2015 at the Wigwam, we arrived on a monday night which is typically slow night for resturants yet Bella Luna was packed with special parties so we ate outside on patio which was surrounded by shopping center parking. service was super and waiter made entree and wine recommendations. The wine \"Italo Cescon\" a Pinot Noir was fabulous.  I had veal oscar hat was tender aand delicious. Dinner was topped of with taramisu that was light, sweet and great texture. Bella Luna is a new favorate when visiting the Pheonix."}
{"text":"Food is, \"eh\". If you're a tall or big guy, good luck fitting at the tables. They try to be Italian, but miss the mark."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have had dinner at Bella Luna. The first two times were both awesome, I had great service excellent choices on the menu and the food was amazing. This last visit was extremely disappointing  I told my girlfriend she would love this place due to the past experiences I have had and sadly we eat about two bites of our food and asked for our check so we could go somewhere else. There was a summer menu with very minimum choices. The food we ordered was soggy (pasta and chicken)I honestly I could have prepared a more appetizing meal at home. I don't know what happened to this place but for the overpriced food and since my five year old could do a better job at making the same food I would not recommend going there any time soon."}
{"text":"This is probably the fanciest restaurant I've been to in Goodyear. That doesn't mean much as Goodyear is a pretty casual place, but if you want to dress up and go out locally, this is one of your only options. The food was pretty good, but not the best Italian I've had. The interior is pretty small in this place and it can get loud if more than one or two groups are dining."}
{"text":"The food aroma was amazing just walking through the door.  The food was great and the service excellent.  Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Finally tried Bela , crab cakes awesome, the wife got the seafood dish with the shrimp in it , very good , I had the chicken parmesan which could have had a better taste to it , the spaghetti that came with it was good. Greg and the rest of the staff were very friendly. Will definitely come back to try something different."}
{"text":"Had the Pollo Alfredo and honestly it was a little bland. I do enjoy that most dishes come with sides (soup or salad and garlic bread) so its worth the price in my opinion. It looks like they do have monthly specials such as a wine tasting night so I will deff be back to try more. The overall appeal of the restaurant was very soothing and had a romantic type vibe. The service was speedy and friendly"}
{"text":"Tried out this place while waiting to take the kids to their school fundraiser at the frozen yogurt spot next door. Looks pretty modern when entering the patio area but then you hit the inside and you can tell this place has been there a while and is ready for a remodel. Not dirty or in bad repair, just dated and very dark. When walking in I saw the special (chicken valdesatana)on the chalkboard and asked the bartender about it. She said customers love it and that it was good. Ok. Tried the special and a chicken fettuccini Alfredo to go. Paid the bill and was a little put off the see it was over $40. I look at the receipt and see they charged me $22.95 for the \"special\"....ok. It's a new place for me so I decide to give it a try maybe it's outta this world, right? Ummm no. Get home and open up the box and it is two anemic little pieces of dry over cooked chicken, some sauce and about 12 gnocchi. . Don't get me wrong the gnocchi was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. Made me believe in gnocchi again. And the sauce that was poured over the chicken was excellent but the stuffed chicken tender pieces were horrible. They weren't even chicken breasts or full tenders. For $22.95 I feel like I was taken advantage of. For what I got that can't be the price!!! I don't even see how they would feel comfortable charging anyone that price for what I was given. The chicken fettuccine Alfredo was a much better deal. Way better portion size for a much better tasting dish and it was only $12. If I come back I won't fall prey to that \"special\" trap again. If you do decide to brave the special make sure you ask about price and portion size in advance."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Wigwam in Litchfield Park and there are very few dining options that aren't on the resort or chains, so this was recommended to us as one of the local options.  It's a cozy little restaurant and the service was very attentive.  We had some good Italian food and wine.  With so few other options, this a very good place to eat in the local area."}
{"text":"Very unassuming from the outside, Bella Luna is actually located at the end of a Safeway shopping center.   However, everything else about this place is great.  I've eaten here 4 or 5 times, trying something new everytime and have not eaten one thing that hasn't been great.  The wine list is rather large for a smallish restaurant.  The service at Bella Luna is also top-notch.  The wait staff is attentive and flexible to requests, and the owners (a husband and wife) will often swing by during the meal to see how everything is.     Prices are also reasonable with most entrees running in the $10-$18 range.  The only drawback is the size.  It's not a huge place, so call ahead or come early.    I suggest:   Veal Saltimbocca-  All of their meat is very good. Tournados-  Will usually only appear as a special, though the chef can usually make it for you if requested. Lasagne al forno-  Just like home.  Tiramisu-  Fantastic.  Not too coffee-ey."}
{"text":"Got the stuffed salmon special last night, it was wrapped in the bottom brown part of the salmon and visually was turned off. The rosato pasta stuff was clumpy and tasted like it was microwaved in a bag. Bruchitta was soggy, not toasted either. The male owner could have cared less and the female owner wearing a bedazzled coat was sitting at a table drinking. Bathroom was gross with a basket of used gold tees for some reason and my wife was stuck in the bathroom cause there was no tp. Never again....."}
{"text":"I think they have been listening to the other reviews because I did not experience some of the flaws this weekend when I took my wife there. We were seated right away, the service was amazing, the bread was fresh and tasty, along with the food. There is plenty to be said about this place and I would suggest not coming in wearing shorts and a muay thai tee like me. The prices were fair for what you get as well as the ambiance. I ordered the lasagna, and my wife Fettucine Alfredo with Pancetta and Peas saying she really enjoyed it and it was authentic tasting. I enjoyed my dinner and would come back during their happy hour with reduced prices for sure. I'd give the service 5 stars, the food 3, and the atmosphere 4. I think the owner was there singing happy birthday songs in Italian which almost bumped it to 5 stars for the cool experience. Just have to judge this place on your own I'd say, but overall it was good. :)   ps. That F*ing cheesecake is to die for"}
{"text":"What an amazing place and amazing food and service and ambiance and lemoncello!  We will be back!  An authentic Italian restaurant!  Our server Greg was delightful!  Food is beyond compare!  Thank you to Check Please on PBS for featuring this great restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out after driving by it several times and seeing the fire places outside. I was disappointed to say the least. We were seated outside at a dirty table. When asked to have a clean table the bus boy rolled his eyes at us. We ordered drinks and there was lipstick on the wineglasses which was gross. We ordered our food and it came out but it was completely the wrong order. When we got our order the sauce was watered down completely-it was like a soup and not fresh, it tasted like it was poured out of a can. When our check came we were charged the wrong amounts for what we ordered as well. Not sure anything right happened. I know I won't be back. I am glad that my boyfriend had a good heart about it all and we were in no hurry. I am also glad it was next to Yogurtini because that totally saved the day!"}
{"text":"Seven of us went to Bella Luna March 15th, a Sunday.  We all had tickets to a concert which was to start at 7:00 PM.  We called for reservations on the patio and asked what time they would suggest so we could make the concert and they suggested 5:00 PM.  When we arrived slightly before five our table was not set up.  Our waiter pushed tables together and one table did not match (height or width). I thought I was sitting at the \"kids\" table on Thanksgiving.  A table next to us, which had no tablecloth, was made out of pressed particle board.  Service was extremely slow and no one seemed to care that we had to be elsewhere at 7:00.  When our food hadn't arrived by 6:25 we began to worry.  When it finally came, we were forced to eat very quickly, but then had to wait a long time for our bill.  We left at 7:05 and missed the first 15 minutes of our concert.  Food was pricey and just not good.  Something is definitely wrong with this restaurant.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"So our second visit to Bella Luna was as good or better than the first. My wife's Lasagna was heavenly. So much better than my own attempt to make it at home. Likewise, my veal piccata was so tender I could cut it with a fork. My kids got the pizza bread and the chicken parmigiana. When they cleaned their plates they finished my pasta and then Napolitan ice cream. Verdict: 4 exquisite meals, excellent wait staff, and we got out of their for $50. This place really is a gem!"}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant with excellent food and staff. I have been here too many times to count and never had the same entrée twice."}
{"text":"I have had both lunch and dinner here.. Family owned restaurant close to work, prices are good, serving sizes are perfect to fill you up without leftovers, service has always been average or better.. No complaints. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great little local Italian place.  Food is very good and I love their cute little patio, despite the location basically being in a parking lot!!!  They have transformed it into a bit of Italy.  Service is great.  Try the butternut squash ravioli.  My fave!"}
{"text":"Mama Mia!  This diamond in the rough (aka strip-mall) is a true gem!  Sayonara Olive Garden!  Make room for Bella Luna.  This Italian enchantment is near my neighborhood and is more than meets the eye.  I was a bit skeptical at first because of it's location, but it has now become my favorite Italian restaurant.    If I lived in Mesa (which I consider half way to NM from where I live), I would make the drive regularly just for the Fettuccine alla Pancetta.  The creamy but not too rich alfredo is fantastic, and mixed with the smoky pancetta and crunchy peas it becomes a pasta lover's oasis.  The lasagne is to die for and another favorite of mine is the Gamberetti pasta - a spicy arribiata sauce with crab and shrimp.  I have tried a few other things that friends and family have ordered, but I have a hard time branching out from the greatness that is Fettuccine alla Pancetta.  Each meal comes with bread with a delectable garlic butter and also a small salad which is fantastic as well.  The wine list is extensive and I personally like the house Chianti.  I have yet to try any desserts as I am much to full to even window shop the menu.  I have only had a few minor negative experiences which all relate to one waitress (the one with the blue eyeshadow), but I have also had experiences with her that were satisfactory.  She's a capable waitress, just don't catch her on a bad day where her service may be a little unfriendly or cold.  She always gets the orders right and is attentive.  Since becoming a recent Arizonan, I try to bring any out of town guest here for a great Italian meal that you can't get anywhere else.  This mom and pop shop tops my list of restaurant raves."}
{"text":"First of all I apologize so late but I cannot thank the staff so much for our wedding last month. We got married on September 19 and we came to have our reception there. We had the BEST service I have ever experienced in my lifetime. The food was EXCEPTIONAL ! The restaurant made me and my wife and my guests feel like we have known them for years! My guests had an awesome time . They loved the food ! The drinks were never empty and the food was EXCEPTIONAL !  The staff there is attentive to your every need and they are all about you on a special day or any day your there. I wish there was more stars to give them because in my book they deserve 10+ !  We will be lifelong forever !! Thank you AJ for the best time ever!"}
{"text":"I was expecting really great Italian food, and was really disappointed. Both the pasta dishes ordered were watery and tasteless. The breaded shrimp was soggy and unfavorable. I am from NY and was expecting authentic Italian food, that is not what I got. The service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant, but it did not make up for how poor the food tasted."}
{"text":"This is the second time we came here. The first was a four star and now we were disappointed. They were slow and so was the service. Food not to rave at all about. Wouldn't take our coupon and we came there 20 minutes to 3pm. Waiter said its the dinner menu that the coupon was for. That's ok, we won't be going back there. Veal was not fresh neither was their bread or chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this mom and pop place! Great food, great service and everyone is so friendly. Romantic surroundings. We just love it all around!"}
{"text":"A 'drive-by' decision and a good one!!    From the outside I wasn't expecting much because it is located in a strip mall. I was wrong. Its not too big of a place but has inside/outside patio choices for seating.   My sister had the Fettuccine Alfredo alla Pancetta. She cleaned her plate! (mind you this is NOT an everyday occurence.)  I had the Gamberetti alla Fra Diovalo (Shrimp and crab meat sauteed in a Fra Diovalo sauce served over linguini pasta) AMAZING dish. I've had diovalo elsewhere and they never seem to get the spicy balance just right. This dish did an amazing job. My shrimp was a little over-cooked but all-in-all I was VERY satisfied. Oddly, we did something we rarely do, ordered dessert!! YUMMY.  DEFINITE MUST TRY(s):  Pistachio Tartufo - Elegant pistachio ice cream covered with pistachios and chocolate sprinkles and the Lemon and Strawberry Sorbetto !!  I want to go back for  more and try different dishes."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were seated immediately and our orders were taken. The food was great, but during our dinner we repeatedly watched people come in and be escorted to sit on the opposite side of the restaurant. We noticed that we were the only ones seated on that side of the restaurant, right next to the restroom. We could not help, but feel discriminated against. We voiced our concern to our waiter and we were told that it was because they were closing the side we were sitting on due to a slow day but when we asked why we were seated on that side instead of the side they intended to keep open he could not respond. We were enjoying our dinner until the realization of such discrimination set in."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, her sister and I decided to visit Bella Luna for a nice dinner. Our first impression was it was a small, nicely decorated restaurant. From the get-go, we were kindly greeted by the owner, seated promptly, and cared for right away. Our server, Nicole, was such a great host! She took care of us quickly but still gave us enough space to feel like were not being rushed.  We had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, which was delightful and so fresh.  Our main courses were fantastic. I had the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, my girlfriend enjoyed her egg plant parmesan and to be honest I can't remember what her sister ordered but it was delicious as well.  We ended the night with NY style cheesecake and it certainly hit the spot.  My impressions of any restaurant are greatly influenced by customer service. Good food is obviously a must I care so much more about being treated well and being taken care of. Bella Luna did both for us.   We normally don't visit the same restaurant twice since we enjoy trying new places. But we will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy 80s..This place looked like it hadn\"t been touched since 1981 with its swirly wallpaper and snakeskin pillows. Definitely needs a facelift. Anyhow, my husband and i came here on Thanksgiving because it was the only thing open other than Dennys and we thought we'd try it out to see if we could find some good italian food. Unfortunately it did not quite hit the mark...  We were seated promptly and there were like 5 other tables dining in so it was not very full. Service was kinda slow, seemed like there was one person making all the drinks because it took almost 20 minutes just to get a glass of wine and an old fashioned. Wine was good but the cocktail was amature. It was like someone dumped half a bottle of maraschino cherries in a cup of whiskey with ice. Blech. Bread that came out was dry and very small not appealing to look at. I ordered the veggie primavera and my husband got the  oscar entree with veal and crab.  Holy gahhhlic! My primavera tasted like it was meant to kill a vampire, way too much garlic and the veggies tasted like they came from a frozen bag. Noodles were definity from a box too, not homemade. My husbands veal was well cooked and the sauce was tasty but it was obvious it all came from a can or jar, especially the crab.   Once again, i am so thirsty for a good italian restaurant that scratch makes their food and tastes better than my homecooking. Why is this like the holy grail!?....the search continues.."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The lamb chops are spectacular , the best I've had.  Owner greets you at the door and we had exceptional service.  Our waiter Richard sang to us in Italian.  Had a great experience"}
{"text":"Yum-may! Cute, little restaurant. You can sit indoors or outdoors. A friend and I sat inside around 6pm. We were the only ones there. By the time we left at around 7:30pm, the place was packed!   The service was very attentive. People came to fill up our water numerous times and cleared our plates away in a timely manner. Our waitress was helpful and even gave suggestions for me.    We ordered the calamari to start. It was delicious! They also served warm bread with butter and parmesean cheese. For the main course, I ordered the Eggplant Parmesean (not on the dinner menu). It came with a salad to start, which was pretty good. The Eggplant Parmesean was so yummy! One of the best I've ever had (better than Cucina Tagliani and Olive Garden).   I will definitely come back whenever I am craving some good Italian food with a nice ambiance and good service."}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for a romantic dinner not knowing what to expect. The restaurant is pretty small, as it gets darker outside the lighting in the restaurant is very moody & we loved it. All the food is cooked to order, as stated on the menu. Both mine and my husbands meals had a very homemade taste in the best way possible. The service was awesome. We found our new little Italian spot!"}
{"text":"Finally a authentic italian restraunt. Located at Indian school rd. And Litchfield rd. On the southwest corner.   A comfortable serene interior comfortabke chairs and a ambience that is relaxing.   We were greeted. By our host and seated quickly. As soon as we sat down our waiter brought chilled icewater veey refreshing.  Avery wide selection of food. Easily catagorized on the menu from meat,chicken seafood,vegan ect.   I ordered the spagetti and meatballs a generous portion very tasty sauce and meatballs that were delish. My wife ordered 4 cheese ravioli she thought the sause was supurbly done with a light meat sauce. Meals came with bread and soup or salad.  We will be back to share great food and memories here. Our waiter explained the different dishes and sauces available.  The prices are very affordable and the portions large."}
{"text":"Would not go back.  Cons:  Was cold in there.  Water glasses were dirty; got new ones. Bread was not good. Food took too long; it was not busy. Husband had butternut squash raviolis. No sauce on ravs; it was on the side and was only a small amount. He asked for more sauce and by the time it arrived, his meal was cold. Sent it back and it came back hot with sauce all over (should've been like that in first place). It tasted okay, not great. I ordered a side of steamed vegetables; they were not hot, just room temperature. Not very romantic or cozy. Too loud because no carpet or sound pads. Cons: Waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Feels like home when I stop at Bella Luna!  We've left Arizona but you can guarantee when we get in town a stop will be made at OUR restaurant. We were back in town and super excited to grab a bite. We weren't let down. The food is still top notch, service is 5 star and the owners are so personable and welcoming. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Verdict: Not worth your time or money...  In town for spring training, my husband and in-laws decided to try this restaurant due to the glowing Yelp reviews. Unfortunately, from the minute we walked in, the experience was disappointing. We arrived for dinner around 8:30pm, a late dinner I admit, and no one was at the hostess station. There are many diners, and the waitstaff is whizzing around, but no one is paying attention to the door. We stand around for around 5 minutes, until finally someone notices us. We are seated, order, and don't receive our food until close to 9:30pm. We ask the waitress what's going on, she says they have a party of 12 on the other side of the restaurant that's causing the slow down. The table behind us is also upset by the long wait, and ask for some free wine. (Ballsy, but I guess they have a point, though I don't believe the restaurant ever offered them anything.) When we do get our food, my mother in-law's chicken is RAW. Seriously. I was shocked, and even tasted a piece to be sure. (Yuck! Raw chicken!) We sent it back to the kitchen, however my mother in-law was turned off to chicken all together after that. She ended up asking for just a simple pasta and sauce. As we ate our food, no waitstaff to be seen. No water glasses refilled, no one coming over to see how we're doing. Our side of the restaurant has been abandoned to the 12 person party on the other side. (Did I mention this place is incredibly noisy too? The acoustics are horrible!!) It's a struggle for us to get our bill, since no one is around. My husband mentions to another staff member (someone higher up than our waitress? Unsure...) how disappointed we are in the quality of food and the service, but that person just doesn't seem to care. You'd think maybe the restaurant would comp the simple pasta my mother in-law ended up getting, to make up for the fact that they tried to serve us undercooked food, but they did not. We were still charged, and that place isn't cheap!  My food was pretty good - crab and shrimp with red sauce on pasta, and I believe my husband and father in-law's food was also good. However, our whole experience was tainted by the poor service. I am very aware we probably caught this restaurant on a bad night,  but we won't be going back or recommending it to anyone. This place is not cheap, and it's not worth going here!"}
{"text":"By far the best Italian place my husband and i have had years. We had the bruschetta first and that alone was so good not just bread with tomato soo good. My husband had the fettichinni Alfredo(excuse my spelling) but the chicken was the best chicken i've ever tasted. I had the fruitti di mare absolutely the most wonderful seafood linguine I've had in my life and my family is full blood Italian from Brooklyn ny. I will definitely be coming back hopefully sooner than later. We were a little under dressed for how nice the place is so definitely put your nice black dress on and guys wear a button up this place is fantastic love love love it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant West of Phoenix.  I've eaten here around 9 or 10 times and have never been disappointed.  When it's cool, the patio is very nice.  Inside, the dining room is quite small.  Even so, we had a company Christmas party here for 12 and didn't feel squished in.  The food is fantastic with my favorite being their Veal Chop or any of the piccata dishes.  Drinks are poured deep as well as glasses of wine.  I strongly recommend."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for dinner and special occasions for 13 years and have always had a great meal. Tommy know exactly how my boys like their meals served, they accommodate menu substitutions and picky eaters. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. The owner is always there. They have a nice selection of wines and delicious Italian food. It's our go to place when we want a good meal."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy cooking, lovely atmosphere, and excellent service:  Bella Luna, one of the best restaurants on the west side.  It's family-run with hand-made food.  I had the Chicken Genovese:  artichokes, tomatoes, mushrooms & capers in a white wine lemon butter sauce.  Yummy.  I usually get the Lasagna with marinara (instead of meat sauce), also outrageous.  I also recommend the shrimp cocktail:  large, crisp, shrimp, served traditional style.  The salmon oscar is delicious, as well as the orange roughy special done egg-battered with risotto.  Delicious.  Excellent wine selection.  The music is Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, big band and other good old classics.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was featured on the hit show \"Check Please\" on Channel 8, where 3 citizens each pick their favorite restaurant and all three eat there, and the cameras are rolling and the food is featured and all three review the food and their experience. It got very good reviews from the panel, and the food looked awesome.  My EX-mother-in-law is one of my best friends. We met here at this restaurant as she lives nearby and suggested trying it. She ranted and raved about her dish the ENTIRE time she ate it. She ordered the Genovese  with chicken, artichoke hearts, broccoli, capers, etc. She told the waiter she loved it, and the owner too. It looked delish!!   My dish was average / typical of what was expected. I ordered the chicken fettucinne. My 5 year old really enjoyed his kid meal chicken strips!!   The atmosphere was nice and relaxing. It didn't feel dated as someone else said. It felt clean and nicely decorated. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. The outdoor patio is probably as large as the indoor eating and it looked nice and relaxing too.  Our waiter, Patrick, went above and beyond to make sure our visit was excellent. He was very attentive to my kid and our special requests for him. I tipped him $8.00 on a $30 bill, but my mother-in-law dropped an extra $5.00 down, saying he deserved it. He was an excellent server!  So, I'd go back, but I would try something different, maybe what my mother-in-law ordered!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch . . . The food was average, had to ask for parmesan for the pasta, no salad dressing except Italian and just oil and no butter for the bread. The service was mediocre and the drink prices were just plain outrageous, even by PHX in-season standards. The cost of our 2 drinks was as much as our 2 lunch entrees. The atmosphere was that of a typical shopping mall restaurant. My 1st and last trip to this restaurant. It is overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"Family owned and everyone was so friendly. Came for an early lunch. Food was amazing! Mom is Italian and she has named this her favorite Italian restaurant. We will be back for the dinner service. Chrystal our server took great care of us too."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious, I went for an early dinner and we both enjoyed a glass of $5 happy hour wine outside by the fires. We enjoyed the four cheese ravioli (or 5 cheese if you add a little extra on top as the adorable gentleman jokes when we got the meal) and the spicy shrimp and scallop risotto. Both dishes were delicious, next time I come to the area I will make sure to stop by here!"}
{"text":"Today's review is a challenge as it's more about the service than the food itself.  If you want the Readers Digest version of the report, skip to the bottom paragraph.    Mom and I went there for dinner.  It was a Saturday night and the outside patio was packed, but it turns out that was a private party, the inside was much more free.    The Hostess greeted us with a welcome and asked if we had a reservation.  I asked \"Do we need one?\"  She replied we did not a lead us to a table in the corner near the front window.  We were only a party of two but she sat us at a 4-top, with plenty of twos available.  I guess they were not planning on being busy that night...?  Here's where the poor part of the evening began, with our waitress.  She came to the table without introduction and asked if we wanted drinks.  We did not so she quickly departed allowing us time to peruse the menu.  When she returned, her first words were, \"Have you decided?\"  Biting my tongue for fear of the endless comebacks I could have used, I asked about specials.  She jumped into recall-mode and tried to think about what was being offered, all without pricing or recommendations.   One of the items was interesting but not enough to make me change my mind on what I was intending on having.  I chose the Lasagna which comes with a soup or salad.  I chose the salad.  There must only be one choice as she did not ask me about my preferences so I have to assume its the only option.  Mom chose the Italian Wedding Soup which on the menu was listed as a single item but the waitress then asked \"Large or Small?\"  Wouldn't \"Cup\" or \"Bowl\" be more appropriate?  The other thing that chapped my ass about this waitress was the fact that we were there well before 6pm and there are Early Bird Dinner specials offered from 3-6 which she never suggested and looked to be a great value...about 6 separate items all for $9.95 each all of them something would like, too!  A basket of bread was brought out along with some Whipped Garlic & Herb Butter.  The bread was exceptionally dried out and squished as though it was cut when it was too hot and then left to air-dry into something reminiscent of old Scones.  Thank god for the butter, its what made he bread tolerable.    My salad arrived along with moms Wedding Soup.  Here is where he marks on this place are salvaged.  The Salad was perfectly proportioned, not too much or little.  The Soup was delicious as well.  OK, I am feeling a little redemption coming on here.    Getting my plate taken away was slow but a bus person finally came by and removed it.  We also requested at that time a refill of water and some fresh bread.  When it arrived this time, the bread was far better than the left overs served to us 20 minutes earlier.  (Maybe they heard us griping about it and this was their attempt at redeeming themselves)   My Lasagna finally arrived and this was impressive when first set down on the table.  Large portion, well presented and very tasty.  Lasagna is an interesting food item as its different everywhere you go.  Not always great but usually OK.....This was wonderful!  It was actually such a large portion I took about 1/2 of it home with me.  This, I would order again!  One thing we notices was the owner and his wife (mother?) walking around and stopping at a few tables.  Based on the conversations we could hear, they were all regulars.  What about us newbie's??  Do we not rate a quick stop to see how things are going??  This is YOUR restaurant and you want to keep the customers coming back, that should include the new guys too, right?  Never happened.  I felt like the red-headed step-child of the restaurant.     Once finished, we again had a new delay in getting the plates cleared as well as the waitress to come back by.  She finally did and asked if were interested in dessert but there was no room for me so we asked for the check.  Another delay.  It was delivered, hand written like in an old-school diner.  We left a credit card and again, another delay in getting it picked up.    Finally she dropped it by the table and said her thank you's....obviously a dinner bill of under $20 was not going to net her a huge tip so there was no need for small talk from her.    As we departed the owner and his wife said thank you and good night.  I stopped to ask him what the waitress's name was  who served us.  He mentioned it and asked \"Why, was everything all right?\"  I replied that I was curious as to her name since she never introduced herself and I was just curious as to whom had served us.  Funny, I still cannot remember it since it was only said one time in the whole evening.  Not that it matters now.   The wrap up...Lousy service, never felt like I was a welcome part of the restaurant BUT great food.  I liked what I had and would certainly try it again....but probably would want to order ahead and get it to go.  The ambiance and setting of home is far nicer than being treated like a outsider at this place."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch take out. Decided on calamari and sausage pasta. The service was very good and server was very welcoming and attentive. I was worried having it to go might take away some of the quality of the food but it sure didn't! I really liked my sausage pasta ($9.95) and calamari ($6.95) and the lunch came with soup or salad and I opted for lentil soup which was delicious! The lunch was packed with marinara sauce, parm cheese, and bread. I would highly recommend for others to come eat here, I sure plan on coming back! (Military discount offered!)"}
{"text":"We were guests at the Wigwam Resort down the road and wanted something Italian.  This was a rare treat and a great find!  Everyone in our party of six loved their orders.  The Osso Bucco was outstanding and everything was piping hot. The staff was friendly and made us feel like regulars instead of out of town guests. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is our go to, special occasion spot. Similar in price to that chain Itailan restaurant with much better, more authentic food. Lovely wine list. Great service. Nice patio with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Here for Thanksgiving... The traditional thanksgiving dinner was great! They even gave us seconds! The ham, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie stood out. The chicken piccata was also amazing."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant, food was delicious, service was awesome. We had the specials Lamb Chops with candied sweet potatoes, and asparagus, delicious. Also had the Orange Roughy with a delicious risotto. Love this restaurant, the best italian restaurant in the West Valley. Love it Bravo..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and wonderful atmosphere! Close to home with a terrific price can't beat that. Oh and great portion as well can't forget that."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for the past 2 years, even before moving to Goodyear. We love this place! The fact that a family runs this is fantastic - sons, daughters and grand daughters makes for a home like feel. We recently have become friends with the owner - Mrs. B. What a lovely lady, one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. We tend to come for lunch, which is an awesome value. Last night we had dinner. Please come for the veal if you like veal. All the recipes taste great. Never over salted. The portions are nice size as we tend to spilt meals. Please stop by and enjoy Sinatra, a terrific wine list and and the great food!"}
{"text":"Went on a sat. They were out of sangria which was disappointing. Ordered caprese, mozzarella did not seem fresh and was over peppered. Had three cheese ravioli, very salty. Ordered cannolis to go, asked how big they were and waitress said three small ones, got two orders. When we got in Car friend checked container and they were each missing one so we went back in to get that fixed. Disappointing and would not go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic gem great food - good service - apoears family owned - good pricing - strip mall location - but classy and conservative decor - nice relaxing environment - had linguini and chicken in an olive basil that I gave a solid 8 - Francese 16.00 Egg battered in a white wine lemon butter sauce was fantastic - good family or date atmosphere - tiramisu and shrimp marsala were other choices with very high satisfaction ratings - real genuine original home Cooked Italian food that is very competitively priced overall great dining experience"}
{"text":"We decided not to eat here!  We drove by on a Friday night and it was empty!  Not a good sign. The unattractive patio with the grill outside which reminded me of a trailer park was also a turn off. No curb appeal. Sorry, just so miserable looking."}
{"text":"My husband and I have found our new favorite restaurant!  Everything, from the extensive wine list to the homemade (by owner Josephine Billelo) Tiramasu was outstanding.  We have company coming in the next month and cannot wait to share this amazing Italian restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday last night.  The antipaste meditterraneian was big enough for two and my veal piccata was perfect.  The only comment i have is that my Cosmo didn't taste like it had any vodka in it and has a sugar-rimmed glass - not my favorite.."}
