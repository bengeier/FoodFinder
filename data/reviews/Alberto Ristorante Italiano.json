{"text":"We moved to Cave Creek a little over a year ago and have been searching for an Italian restaurant.  The food and service are wonderful here.  My husband and I were reminded of some of the great places we found in Italy. It is our new favorite place."}
{"text":"I love Alberto's. Every dish I have had there has been amazing: the caesar salad (especially the dressing) is great, the pizza is fantastic and authentic (the prosciutto pizza is especially tasty), and the gorgonzola gnocchi might be the best thing I have had at any restaurant. Ever. Also you are always greeted personally by Alberto who is a continual source of great stories. If I lived anywhere close to Cave Creek I would be there every day."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Happiest I've been w/ pasta since spending time in Rome.  Soup is really good too."}
{"text":"We are big fans of this sweet little spot in Carefree.  The service is wonderful - friendly and helpful.  The food is incredibly fresh and they feature wonderful specials."}
{"text":"I've been going to Alberto's for years and have enjoyed every evening. Alberto is a great host, the service is a comfortable pace and the food delicious!"}
{"text":"Alberto was so cute!  He cheerily greeted us and showed us to the bar.  We ordered the bruschetta with wine while we waited for our to-go order to be prepared.  Alberto visited with us briefly to ensure we enjoyed our bruschetta - and we loved our appetizer!  YUM!  Fresh, fresh, fresh tomatoes and bursting with flavor!  It was fun just being a part of the experience at Alberto's!.  Try the desserts!"}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients alone are just amazing! The food is fantastic! I love the atmosphere! Very gracious staff. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service: excellent Food: bruschetta was very good, but not really needed because they bring more than enough bread with dipping oil and a bean mixture. Caesar salad was ok... Eggplant Parm was the best I've ever had. My husband had spaghetti with Italian sausage. He liked it, but wasn't wowed. Keep in mind he is excited about McDonalds. The house red was a perfect compliment to the dinner.  Atmosphere: reminds me of a corner Italian place in NYC. Like the movie Moonstruck.  Price: what we expect for N. Scottsdale or Cave Creek.  Reservations: may be a good idea on a weekend during the winter/spring months."}
{"text":"Alberto is one of the best I have ever experience!  The food, the service and special attention are all part of this experience.  The authentic Italian ingredients make for a delicious and outstanding menu.  Alberto is a master of greetings and authenticity.  The food presentation is wonderful and the wine is fantastic.  Melissa is a super server and makes you feel right at home.  If you are looking for a great authentic Italian meal and a great experience, this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Just made a visit to Alberto Restaurant. Well he is baack! after a months hiatus. Not to be disappointed the lasagne was fabulous. The old stand by  Caesar salad was no slouch either. And the bruschetta was to die for......OMG! The most fresh and flavorful mouthful I can remember. I will pass this life remembering the food at Alberto Restaurant as trip to Italy are so ponderous."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Everything was delicious, we had the wonderful bread with the \"Italian beans\", and both the Mushroom and Caesar salads.  For the main courses the lasagna, rigatoni matriciana and linguine vongole were all great.  Great experience, we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Like eating in the restaurants in Rome. All good!! Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The folks are very friendly and the service excellent but that's about it... We were so disappointed with the food. The bread is very crispy on the edges and didnt taste good. We ordered caprese for appetizer and couple of pizzas. The caprese had very less cheese on it, for 16 dollars, it was very disappointing.  The margherita pizza was dripping with olive oil, the crest was too crispy and there was so much cheese on the pizza. Very disappointed as we went after reading so many nice reviews. The price for the quality of food seemed exorbitant.  We definitely do not plan to go back."}
{"text":"Purely authentic Italian restaurant.  Exceptional food!  Exceptional service!  Alberto watches every detail.  I have lived in Carefree for 14 years.  This is regrettably my first trip to this restaurant.  It won't be my last."}
{"text":"Is it possible 2 small Pepperoni Pizzas to go cost $45? Very undercooked awful pizza. Would not return."}
{"text":"To begin, the food had good flavor however the portions are extremely small. For $19 per meal at an Italian restaurant I expect to be full. The wine pours were about 4 ounces and my \"lasagne\" had 2 bites of ground meat a single lasagne noodle and sauce. My husband's \"sausage with spaghetti special\" consisted of a 3 inch piece of sausage and a child portion of spaghetti. The caprese salad for $13 had 4 paperthin slices of mozzerella and tasteless tomatoes. Our waiter (maybe the owner) never came to our table after dropping the entrees. Sorry, for a few dollars more we e are sticking with Sassi or Gianofranco's."}
{"text":"It started out great, then went downhill very quickly! We went early on a Sat. night and were the first ones there. Got great service until other people showed up. We told them we are local residents lookng for a good Italian restaurant to frequent, but got ignored. Food was ok. Had a seafood risotto and was annoyed to have to shell my own crab (very messy with red sauce all over it). Coffee machine broken."}
{"text":"My wife and I just love this place.  They make the best Chicken Alfredo but it is not on the menu. Very authentic.  Wine list is great and Alberto is always there making sure everyone is happy.  Almost forgot, their bruchetta is the best we have ever had!  It is small and on the weekend I would suggest reservations.   Hope you enjoy!  We do."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time and I felt an unwelcoming feeling when we opened the door.  Yup, my feeling was right. There were a lot of tables opened but they denied us. They even not offered later time and not patio table that were opened. They shutdown us. Because I am minority that I felt. Never ever try back this restaurant again!! This is the first time the restaurant I received denied to eat. They are discriminated against minority people!! Shame on you!! I even don't want to leave any star."}
{"text":"Simply the best Italian food I have found in Arizona! the pizza is fantastic! made in a real wood burning oven! Alberto is great man and his food is his love shared with you. Loved his Ragu Meat sauce and is home made desserts were awesome...A simple place! A fantastic place!....a must try! Make a reservation he does get booked up for sure........."}
{"text":"We have been going to Alberto's for over a year and my wife and I love it. It's one of our favorite places as we enjoy good authentic Italian food. I took a work colleague there last night and we started the vewing by having a prosciutto wood fired pizza.   Call ahead and make sure Alberto keeps the oven on for you. Not starting your dining experience without sampling one his wood fired pizzas would be sacrilege.  My wife ordered a pasta dish and I went for the Oso Bunco. It's one of the best I have ever had and done to perfection. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of Barolo and shared a Tartuffo for desert. This is as real as it gets.   The restaurant is owned and operated by Alberto who is from the old country. Next time in Cave Creek make sure to stop by and try it. Tell him Ed @ Anna sent you."}
{"text":"We were greeted right away and sat down.  Great food, very authentic I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone"}
{"text":"It's like an instant trip To Italy.  Great food and wine.  His tiramisu is directly from the man that invented the desert.  So much love for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Of all the great places for dining in this area, this is a true gem. Alberto gives his customers a real feel of dining in Rome.  All of his food is fresh and wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Alberto's often as we are locals.  It's great to have a neighborhood place where you are greeted by name.  Alberto, the owner, is a real gem and runs this charming and cozy place.   Ask Alberto for a wine recommendation, he'll give you a great bottle in the price range that you ask for.   The warm homemade bread with homemade dips and great olive oil are a great way to start the meal. The bruschetta is fabulous, and a must-have starter.  I also love the Artichoke salad, it's very unusual and tasty, with plenty of shaved parmesan.   My favorite entrée is the Fettucine Alberto- a cheesy tomato sauce over fresh homemade fettucini.  The pastas are good sized portions and you will not leave hungry.   Sadly, I'm not sure we've left enough room for dessert on our last few visits.  Enjoyable meal, cozy setting, and great food."}
{"text":"All of the food was delicious. A very nice and quiet setting, very authentic Italian feeling. We had a Caesar salad which was excellent. The prosciutto and melon which he slices to order. And 2 different pizzas which were amazing. The tiramisu was excellent and canoli was authentic with cherries and raisins inside. It was a very delicious meal and the owner came by the table to talk to us and was very warm and welcoming. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, I felt like I was eating in Little Italy again - what a friendly & welcoming ambience, and absolutely delicious food!  There were four of us dining, plus our friend's 13 month-old, Mac. Can I just say that the staff treated Mac like royalty?  Alberto even brought him biscotti while we were figuring out what to order.  We very much enjoyed the bread, beans, and the herb-infused olive oil.  We ordered both house and Caesar salads - all were fresh, crisp, and the dressings were excellent.  Our entrees were two veggie lasagnes, the \"tri-meat\" special, and I had the chicken with wild mushrooms.  Everyone raved about their meal, and I thought mine was simply outstanding.  We topped that off with a cannoli, the peach sorbet (served in a frozen peach!), and a chocolate dessert.  All were very good.  As good as the food was, it was easily surpassed by the friendliness and perfect service from the staff.  I hihly recommend Alberto's."}
{"text":"We arrived for dinner at 6 and were the second table seated. About 45 minutes later several parties of locals started arriving--always a sign of a good restaurant!  All of the food was great. We had the vegetable lasagne, seafood pasta, and Italian Sausage. Nicely seasoned and reasonable portion sizes (not too huge).  Ambiance was nice with Christmas music playing and Alberto joining in on some of the songs. :) very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Pros: Inviting, warm atmosphere. Staff was friendly. Had the house salad, I would give it a strong six out of 10. Dressing was a little over-the-top, but it was basically fresh, but not particularly distinguishing. We were provide complementary bread, and two toppings. One topping was a kind of a pesto and olive oil mixture. Not much flavor. There was also a bean dip mixture, that was bland and generally off-putting.  Cons: we ordered their recommended specials, the eggplant Parmesan, and branzino fish with a white wine sauce. We recommend avoiding both of them. First the eggplant; it was under cooked and the tomato sauce was flavorless. Portion size was small to medium. No pasta or veggie side for the eggplant($17). The branzino fish($29), large portion, was served with a white wine sauce that was kind of grayish in color. The fish had a very strong \"fishy flavor\". It must've been frozen. It was basically unedible. The side vegetable was a single broccoli head and a chunk of zucchini.   Summary: our $80 meal included two glasses of wine, one salad, an eggplant without sides, and a branzino entry. (Most of the branzino was left behind). ( We are fish lovers)."}
{"text":"Still the best authentic Italian food in town! We ordered the Bronzino carpaccio - absolutely the BEST carpaccio we have EVER tasted. I should also point out that this is the only restaurant we have ever visited that offers Bronzino carpaccio!  Also ordered the veal scallopini with lemon & capers. Delicious!  If you want a true Roma experience, you must visit Alberto's. He lives part time IN Rome, can't get more authentic than that!"}
{"text":"The place was empty, Alberto said due to it being summer.  The food was amazing.  I had the vegetable soup and veal, both we're great.  My wife had eggplant which was the best she ever had.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant.  Thanks Yelpers for the suggestion.  Not a fancy place, but the food is awesome."}
{"text":"First time here.  Allison served us and was amazing.  The place was packed but we were seated quickly. Salads were huge so we shared. The guacamole on the cheese crust was delicious.  All in all, good food with great service and a good value for what we paid. We were there around 2 hours, working on a project and Allison would check on us occasionally to see if we needed anything. I will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service from Alberto was great but the food server was very inexperienced and overwhelmed. The food was good although not described well (see above food server comment). For example, Bowtie Pasta with artichokes in a white sauce has me thinking that it is a creamy sauce. It was a white WINE sauce the noodles certainly were not bowtie. Still tasted OK.  Overall, it was a cute place and deserves another chance. Hopefully the food server will be more seasoned."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. Stopped in on a Saturday night. Service was great. Caesar salad and prosciutto melon were wonderful. Mine and my husbands entrees were great, I had the clams. Will definitely be back again. The lighting is a bit bright."}
{"text":"It is tough being a judge of Italian food when you have had homemade italian all your life.  After reading all the reviews, I was really excited to try this place since it is fairly close to my neighborhood.  Well, I was a little disappointed.  We had the margherita Pizza as an appetizer.  The crust was good, the sauce was tasty, but it had so much cheese the the center part of the crust was soggy.  Too much cheese does not make a great pizza.  The amount of cheese was excessive.  I had the Lasagna, uhm what can I say.  I know that he probably made it the night before or even that morning, but it should have been heated completely.  Have way through it I got a cold piece of riccotta, not good.  My husband had the gnocchi with pesto sauce.  My uncle Aldo is from Genoa, where Pesto is originally from.  The sauce was too rich with an excessive amount of cheese and cream.  I had two bites, didn't want more.  The dessert we ordered was the apple torte.  Not one of the best I've had.  It was almost like a cold apple pie with raisins and dry fruit.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Perfect little family restaurant.  Not much to look at from the outside, hidden away in a little strip mall. But it's super cozy and authentic inside.  Alberto is usually there to greet us.  I didn't even like Italian food when my husband first brought me here. But I'm totally hooked on Alberto!  If you're in the area, seek this place out."}
{"text":"This is a neat little restaurant. The place is nothing fancy, but is has a homey \"old school\" vibe to it.  Alberto the owner is a great host. Melisa, who is the waitress, is very attentive and friendly. I have eaten here four times and it's been great. I really enjoy the soup, calzones and the tiramisu."}
{"text":"This is the worst food I've ever had. Absolutely terrible. 2 hour wait for reheated pork.. Pasta not cooked. Pathetic. Just because you have an old Italian guy giving the special doesn't make you an authentic Italian place. You should turn on the gas on, shut the door, light a match and walk away cause it would be better burnt down. What a joke. You should go back to where you came from."}
{"text":"The staff was fantastic. The owner was delightful. However, the food was much to be desired. Small portions, the New York strip and arugula was very bland. The red snapper with clams should have come with a pasta or even a salad. The salmon was over cooked and the balsamic glaze was overpowering. Really nice people, really bad overpriced food. We did take home some tiramisu. Surprisingly it was actually quite tasty."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Carefree.  Great food and service.  Alberto was great!  Everything was fresh and made to order.  Tiramisu was awesome!"}
{"text":"We discovered Alberto's last night when Oregano's had an hour and a half wait time.  The owner was professional and very kind to us but our service was extremely slow. We waited about an hour for our main course to arrive. My mother did not her food for another 10 minutes after we all got ours. Unfortunately, when it did come, she ended up being disappointed with her linguine and clams. It was a generous portion size but extremely bland. Other than that, the rest of us enjoyed our dishes immensely.   When we mentioned it was both our daughter and her grandma's birthday, Alberto surprised us with a freshly made nutella pizza straight out of the oven.  It was delicious!   The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is due to the slowness of service. My husband and I are definitely coming back for a date night when we have more time to just relax and enjoy the ambiance.  We appreciated Alberto's thoughtfulness and look forward to trying more of his dishes."}
{"text":"Dinner last night.  A warm and family feel to a classic traditional Italian restaurant.   The host who seated us and took our order was charming.  We shared a Cesar salad, linguine with wild mushrooms, and veal picatta.  The salad was adequate...really good dressing.  The linguini was superb (wonderful mushrooms), as was the veal.  The portions were modest, especially the veal.  Ceratinly worth a return."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love Italian food and we had driven past Alberto's a couple of times in the last few weeks and reminded ourselves that we needed to go there. Debbie read reviews and told me that the food reviews are great, but said that Alberto, the owner, is grumpy.   We walked in last night and there was this charming man who greeted us with a big smile and made us feel quite welcome. We realized quickly that this was Alberto and he was warm, friendly, and passionate about his restaurant and food offering. He was walking around and making sure that people were happy. We asked him about Italy and his restaurant in Beverly Hills and we loved hearing about his past successes.   The food was amazing! It was fresh and very flavorful. I am definitely not a \"foodie\", but when I have something that is amazing, it gets my attention. This definitely Got my attention. Alberto's has been at this location for sixteen years. It's our new favorite Italian restaurant.   If you are looking for authentic Italian food, go to Alberto's. You will be glad that you did."}
{"text":"First time... Well see how it is. this was a very nice restaurant. the owner himself comes out and talks to you. wasnt very busy the night we went. they try hard to get you what you want even if it isnt on the menu. i cant remember exaclty what i ordered but it was very good. my husband got a pizza it was very good as well. maybe we'll go back if we are ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Not a very inviting place to go. Not very welcoming. First time I've experienced a rude reception. A lot of better places to go to...,and better food like Spiga. He said no table for us and just walked away....RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"Went there five weeks ago, been there two times since. I absolutely love this place. It has that Little Italy feel from Baltimore. I have not been able to come up with a favorite yet, because everything I have tried is so good! The pizza is amazing. My husband loves the veal dishes. Its a must try. You'll be hooked. Oh and the owner will greet each and every one of you !"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! Real Italian and the owner is always here. He is amazing! Great atmosphere and staff is super nice. Loved our experience!!"}
{"text":"Alberto's = Best Italian food I've had in ages (besides my Dad's, love you!). One of the great things about Italian food is the love and quality ingredients that the cook puts into the meals. This cuisine was not created by those fancy smanshy chefs that primarily focus on presentation, nope, homeslice, it's all grandma and the passing down of recipes!   You will get Quality and Authentic Italian food here at Alberto's and he makes sure you are enjoying what you are eating by frequenting your table at some point during each course. I love the casualness and homey feel of Alberto's. The mismatched Italian plates really make you feel like you are in someone's kitchen with the bonus of having very friendly and efficient staff waiting on you.  Based on Yelper's suggestion, we started with the Bruschetta and Caesar salad. The Bruschetta was good, the homemade sourdough bread was awesome, but I would have added a few more ingredients like I do at home to the tomato mixture, but hey, I'm Italian and therefore overly critical of this cuisine, but I would still order it again! The Caesar salad was so amazingly scrumptious that I pulled out my phone and wrote a quick tip without realizing it! I know, right? So rude, but I had to share that moment with my fellow Yelpers and thank God my date found it amusing.  I loved all the parmesan on it! Finally someone that will used adequate amounts of this cheese, everywhere else skimps on it! For my main entree I ordered the eggplant parmigian. Again, thank you Alberto for using delicious cheese and only offering eggplant when its in season because that dish, my friend, was so fresh and tasty! I love, LOVE cannolis and almost gave my date a dead-arm when I punched him to point out that they were on the menu. Needless to say he knew what I wanted to order for dessert... Anyhoo, this was my only buzzkill of the restaurant. My ideal cannolis are plain and simple, ricotta and semisweet chocolate bits, done. Alberto's, well not so simple. He uses mascarpone, with an orange flavor, a few citrus pieces and cherries. The shell of the cannoli (not the filling!) was flavored with cinnamon which was a nice touch, but the citrus pieces and orange flavoring  was an \"awe, man\" bummer moment. But, I am now over it and still in love with Alberto and his restaurant...you need to check it out if you are in Cave Creek and want REAL Italian food!"}
{"text":"Great authentic pizza. The Margarita is excellent. Cute local owned atmosphere."}
{"text":"From now on if I want Italian food, this is the only place I will go. AMAZING food and perfect service!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant and for the remainder of our visit, one thing became crystal clear; Alberto, (Owner) will do everything and anything humanly possible to insure your experience is a good one. The service was flawless.  The food? Well his bread is off the charts with its thick crust and chewy crumb. For that matter, so is his herb infused olive oil. The entrees on the other hand were just average or slightly above.   An antipasti will cost you twelve dollars, but I don't recommend ordering one since it's ridiculously small and not enough to share with two average sized adults. The house wine,  a chianti, was delicious and priced-right at six dollars a glass.  Both of us felt the entrees were overpriced, however, the service more than made up for it.  Alberto will be our 'go to' Italian restaurant, but only for special occasions due to it being so pricey."}
{"text":"Maybe the best pizza I've ever had. We have been here several times and always ordered pasta, which is excellent. This time we order the margarita pizza. It was amazing. We will not be ordering pizza from anywhere else again. Thanks Alberto!"}
{"text":"The two items I ordered were both very bland. The Ceasar Salad dressing tasted like regular oil and vinegar. No flavor at all. The wood fired pizza that they brag about was also bland and without flavor. I would highly recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"We came in for the first time last night and it was wonderful. Food is amazing, atmosphere relaxed and inviting, service fantastic. We will be back many many times. Best Italian restaurant I've been to since leaving Europe. Thank you."}
{"text":"It's nice when Plan B turns out better than Plan A would have been had it not failed so miserably.  Thanks to Yelp, we did not leave Cave Creek hungry (then again, we never leave anywhere hungry), but we did leave happy.  I love the homey feeling this little gem offers.  Alberto himself greets his guests, takes orders, and serves us as if we are family.  Well, maybe not my family, but someone else's much warmer and friendlier family.  We quickly devoured the fresh bread and dipping oil, moving on to delicious Caesar salads.  How I love a well-dressed salad.  After seeing one too many episodes of Hell's Kitchen, my husband opted for risotto.  No need to settle on what's offered on the menu, as they will prepare it any way you'd like.  Alberto suggested a seafood risotto with a spicy tomato sauce.  This was perfection with ample shrimp, lobster, scallops and mussels.  The tomato sauce was spicy, but not overpowering.    Alberto does offer one hand-made pasta, fettucini.  I opted for a simple dish of this pasta with fresh tomato and garlic.  The fettucini was perfect, but I found the dish a tad salty and the thickly sliced garlic was not cooked enough IMHO.  I enjoyed the meal, but the risotto was really the star of this show.  For dessert, we shared a tart with fig jam.  Alberto's jams are hand-made as well.  Needless to say it was a mistake to share this dessert.  I wanted my own and will have it next time.  And there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Adorable Italian restaurant with red and white checkered tablecloth twinkle lights excellent service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Alberto himself greeted us and took our order. We wanted a pizza but he told us (quietly) not to order the pizza because his pizza guy had called in sick and the cook making the pizzas that night was not very good at operating the pizza oven (people at the next table had pizza though!) Odd, but we believed him. I then asked if he had ravioli without the seafood (that was the special that night) and he did not. Strike two. (I dislike any and all seafood). So I ended up with penne alfredo, which was very good but still not my first choice. Hubby had the salmon and loved it. The wine was good also. It was a little awkward dining there as the dining room was almost empty and the lights were very bright, and we were seated in the center of the restaurant. We will go again though, Alberto was charming."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick glass of wine and ended up staying for a fresh puzza.  This place is worth the price but be prepared for a pricy outing.  I was greeted and served by Alberto himself. Being his restaurant he took care of me with class and efficiency.  I had the margarita pizza which I expected to come with tomatoes on top. When it did not come that way I asked the owner why. He politely told me that the true recipe from it's original creator had no tomatoes on top. He continued to tell me the story of how the margarita pizza got it's name!! True Italian heritage   My drink never went dry, and I had an exceptional pizza. No complaints from me.   Keep up the good work guys. I really felt at home and welcomed the whole night. Plus stealer food.   This will definitely be on my list to come back."}
{"text":"First off, if you don't have Italian friends to cook you real Italian food, look no further. Alberto is accepting new mouths-to-feed applications. I am lucky because my Mr. is Italian and \"Wow's\" me on a regular basis with his cooking.  Location: You can see it from the main road, can't remember if you can access it from each direction in the road. Parking a plenty.  Staff: Alberto himself and Susan, a mother with grown kids who just needed to get out of the house and move around. Both were exceptional.   Cocktail: when I ordered my martini \"filthy\" it's exactly how it came, made by Alberto himself.   Wine: We asked Alberto for a recommendation, he produced a bottle of vintage 2000 Italian red wine, sorry, can't remember the name. He was so proud of it and happy to share. He had just purchased the wine and it wasn't even on the list yet. It went perfectly with every bite!  Appetizer: We just ordered a caprese (sp?) salad which was fabulous. They make their own dressings!  Entree: I ordered shrimp pasta with white wine sauce. One bite into it my eyes rolled into the back of my head. It was the. most. incredible. pasta. ever. The pasta noodles are indescribably delicious. They tasted really pasta-y and were perfectly al dente. The shrimp tasted so fresh and the wine sauce was the perfect compliment.  I will definitely be back as soon as humanly possible and you should too."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try this place based on the 'wood-burning oven' sign so we stopped in recently for dinner.    I'm not sure  what they cook in the wood-fired oven because it wasn't anything we had.  Maybe the pizzas?     We didn't even know they had pizza until we saw someone leaving with a take-out box and asked.   The pizza is listed on a separate menu and we were not given that menu.         The service was friendly.  Our waiter (Alberto the owner?) took our order but did not write it down.    He forgot what we ordered and had to come back to confirm a couple minutes later.  We had: -  Baby artichokes with parmesan - not an attractive dish and the artichokes were tough and woody. - Lasagna - My husband said it was ok.  - Chicken Parmigiana - I ate only part of this.  The breading was soggy and the chicken was dry and over cooked.   We were disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great place well worth the drive from downtown Scottsdale.  Its a little hard to find as its in a strip mall with a few small businesses, but the authentic Italian fare is worth the trouble and the money!  On most nights you will even be greeted by Alberto himself or he will drop by your table sometime during the meal.  The food is fantastic.  My family and I went here twice on our 10 day trip to Scottsdale and enjoyed everything we tried. Most of our party ordered the house chianti, and Alberto offered a different variety of chianti that was a higher quality for the same price.  That kind of service isn't something you would find at most other restaurants.  The first time we went we started with the bruschetta. The tomatoes were fresh and the white vinegar, garlic and spice marinade was delicious.  For the entree I got one of the nightly specials which was beef braciole served with my choice of pasta(rigatoni and red sauce). The beef was tender and flavorful and the homemade red sauce was so good I had to stop myself from licking the plate when I was finished.   My other family members had the chicken parmigiana and the other specialty which was spinach and ricotta ravioli.  All of these meals were tasty, the only complaint was the ravioli was a rather small portion.    Though I'm not a dessert eater myself the mmms and ahhs that came out of my family's mouths when they devoured the cannoli and tiramisu meant they were a winner.    The second time we went we had the Cesar salad and wood fired pizza which were up to the same standards as the first time.  All in all this place is a winner."}
{"text":"This has been our third visit since we moved to Cave Creek this past May. We love Alberto and his restaurant. He is so accommodating. The food is so fresh. The traditional atmosphere is perfect. We told Alberto we will be back on Sunday night and he said he would make a special dessert for us, a traditional summer dessert from Italy. Royal treatment is what you get when dining at Alberto's! We are looking forward to many years of dining excellence at our favorite restaurant! Thank you Alberto for your passion and for your wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Alberto's for years.  We always have a wonderful time here, have tried almost everything on the menu at one time or another and never had a disappointing meal.   The food is very authentic, homemade Italian food.  Alberto is from Rome and knows what he is doing in the kitchen and he is always so pleasant to talk to.  He is also excellent with wine and I don't even look at the wine list anymore, I just ask him to surprise me and he always brings an excellent bottle for a fair price.    Some people say the service is a little slow, but even so, that too is authentico Italiano.  And why hurry when you are having such good food and vino?  Relax, la dolce far niente."}
{"text":"There pizza is amazing and homemade Ordered take out and it was made in about 20 to 25 mins. Have never ate in the restaurant but when I went and picked up our food, they were so nice and friendly. The owner is a nice italian man."}
{"text":"What apeals to me about Alberto's is it's non-prententious ambiance.  The checker board tablecloths and mis-matched italian plates really gives the feeling of a true Country Italian eatery.  The decorations are reflective of the food; uncomplicated and simple.   if you want good food, and love discovering hidden gems, this is for you. If you are looking for fancy, this isn't for you."}
{"text":"Really, one of the best Italian Restaurants in the Valley.  Alberto greets his guests, and everyone is made to feel like part of the family.  Alberto comes from Rome, and his dishes are made to reflect his Italian background.  The bread is made from his own recipe and made daily for his retaurant.  Extensive wine list, some rare Armanacs, Cognacs and other liquors to enjoy after dinner.  Expensive, but well worth it.  A real treat for those people who actually know good food and enjoy a family experience."}
{"text":"I'd almost give the place 5 stars even if the food was crap just b/c Alberto is so darn cute! My youngest (4) was insistent that she needed macaroni. Well, there wasn't a kid's menu. So, I told her we'd get pizza. When Alberto came to the table, she decided to ask him, \"Do you have any macaroni?\" He answered, \"For you, yes!\" She gave me the smuggest look ever. It seems like we had some of everything. The ravioli was super rich. But, really good. The margherita pizza was wonderful! We've gotten it \"to go\" a few times since b/c it's a lot better than Barro's. The only thing I didn't love was the cannoli.  In terms of atmosphere, it's more refined than the cowboy restaurants in Cave Creek. But, still casual and comfortable enough that we could bring the kids."}
{"text":"Went with friends at 6pm. We were first customers. By the time we left at 8, the restaurant was pretty full.  Alberto is a fantastic host. I don't even need a menu....he steers me the right way from wine selection to salad and all.   Bruschetta is to die for....so good. Must get it! He also brings over small sides like seasoned beans and bread with Berber olive oil.   Tonight he had a jamon from Italy, so he rolled the leg to our table and sliced prosciutto table side. It was incredible.   Some had Caesar salad, some had house salad. I can't tell what was better....Caesar is the best I've ever had.   The specials each night are fantastic, so we all four went that way. He makes his own pasta and sauces fresh, so you can order off-menu. \"Watcha you want?\" And he makes it. Crazy good.   My friend and I had the ravioli....she wanted a vodka sauce. He made it (ok, he even made a special ravioli that wasn't listed as a special....so he customized our entire entree). Hubs both had a sausage and broccoli dish with spaghetti in olive oil. Sounds weird, and it looked weird. But wow.....it tasted like heaven."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment to all Italians everywhere.  One order (margarita pizza) never came to the table and once it arrived it did not come as ordered.  The pasta fagioli soup left a lot to be desired and something I could've eaten from a can at home. It was majorly acidic.  The spaghetti pescatori was bland and the pasta was cut up... like they made it for a toddler. Extremely disappointing for a $28 dish.   It seems Alberto is out to convince American's that this is what real Italian food is. Let me tell ya, we come from Calabria, Italy where we celebrate food. This place is not somewhere you want to celebrate.  You want a nice dish of pasta?  Come over to my house! I'll make it for you.  And I won't empty your wallet for it either."}
{"text":"Great little find in Cave Creek. Nothing fancy but great food!  Everything read homemade. Loved the chicken raviolo. Nice wine selection."}
{"text":"Not only is Alberto the friendliest proprietor you'll meet, he is hands on daily to ensure the highest quality meal and service. Amazing homemade dishes, terrific wine list and desserts to die for! From Caesar salad to Tiramisu and everything in between, you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this restaurant but I believe the quality has gone down some, the last time we went our linguine with clam sauce tasted like a bit like lighter fluid."}
{"text":"First time trying out Alberto Italian restaurant and was quite happy with our pizza and Cesar salad.  They make their Cesar dressing by hand and boy was it very tasty! Best I have had in a long time. I had the Prosciutto Pizza.  You can tell they make their cheese by hand by the yummy taste and the prosciutto was good as well. The sauce was light and allowed the other flavors to stand out. Other half ordered the Al Fattore (Dried Beef, mozzarella, smoked cheese) and it was very delicious. Both of them had a nice crispy crust the way a wood fired pizza should be.   On a side note I did talk to the owner and he hand makes all his cheese and bread. He doesn't believe in cheap ingredients which is why you don't see Pepperoni Pizza on his menu. He believes in the best ingredients which is why it is so tasty."}
{"text":"Went there twice.  Not impressed the first time so thought we'd give it a second try.  Service is slow and ordinary.  Food is not bad but not great.  Out of the 6 different entrées the Fettucine Ragu was the best.  Everything else is just ok.  The decor is nice but they do not dim the lights for dinner.  I was hoping for a nice quiet evening by candlelight and instead I got artificial lighting in a too bright room.  Not a bad place but not a great place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's definitely a hidden gem! It's such a wonderful place to share a meal with friends and family. The food is incredible and the atmosphere is very authentic. The service is wonderful- definitely deserving of 5 stars. Perfect for family dinner, date nights or girls' night out :)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Service was great!  The chicken Marsala was everything that I was looking for. Eating there felt like eating at your Italian grandma's house. We will be going back often."}
{"text":"After so many great reviews, who could NOT try this place, right?  Meh.  That's about my review of Albertos.  The food was really average, while being high priced for the portion size and taste.  Yes - the pasta was cooked perfectly, but the rest of the meal was (again) meh.  We had the antipasto, and while good, was nothing spectacular.  The bread was great ,and so was the pesto olive oil for dipping.  Good thing I'm a carb addict...  The marinara sauce is more the orange-y kind, rather than really red, robust sauce like you find back East.  I had the braciole, and while most everywhere else in the world this translates to a stuffed beef roll, this was not stuffed.  Think tough, rolled, thin beef.  It was like carpeting.  Cannoli is not made with ricotta (what??), tasted more like mascarpone.  And there was no shortage of rum in the tiramisu.  None at all.   Overall, it was OK, but I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Alberto's is definitely a hidden gem in Cave Creek.  Their pizza was one of the best I have ever eaten.  Their pasta and meat balls were also to die for.  Alberto is from Rome and he knows Italian cuisine.  If you're looking for glamour and glitz, this is not the place.  If you want to have some amazing Italian cuisine at a restaurant that feels more like grandma's place in the country, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night without a reservation. Very small restaurant (about 12 tables). Originally, one of the staff asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't. Four tables were empty, although they did have reserved place cards on them. Alberto found us a table. Several people came in after us and were told they couldn't be accommodated without a reservation, which seemed strange.   Served us some bread with a goofy spread with beans and also some pesto olive oil. I just like some olive oil and Parmesan cheese. I had to ask for the Parmesan and practically beg to have them leave it at the table. Actually, the server took it away later in the meal, then returned it after serving some to other customers. She said it was the only one they had. Really?  Italian restaurant with only one container of Parmesan?     I had a glass of house Merlot and my wife had the house chianti. $6 each and delicious.   Had the Caesar Salad, which was outstanding. One of the best.   Then it was downhill. I ordered the standard chicken Parmesan. My go-to for any Italian restaurant. I figure if you can't do that right, it's hopeless. My wife ordered the special--chicken ravioli.   I asked if the chicken parm came with pasta. Alberto told me no, it comes with some grilled veggies. I said I'd rather have pasta. He said no, they don't do pasta this week as a side. OK, fine then.   The chicken parm came with a very large chicken breast, covered in cheese with what I'm guessing is some form of marinara sauce. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the breading was crisp and light. The sauce was nothing...blah, tasteless. Seems like it was from a can of SpaghettiO's. Really, I've had better sauce from a jar of Ragu. My wife said the same with her ravioli. Tasteless. No oregano, no basil, no garlic, no salt, no spices, no taste.   We had the tiramisu for dessert, which was a 6 out of 10. Good, but not even close to being one of the better tiramisu's I'd had.   It's a shame. Cute restaurant with red checkered tablecloths. Quirky owner and waitstaff. Less than average food. Oh, and three of the four reserved tables were still empty when we finished dinner.   Now, we come from the Chicago area, where we have great restaurants and pretty high standards. But I've had better Italian food at Macaroni Grill. That's sad!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and were staying at the Carefree Resort and Conference Center, so we wanted to find something local.  We found this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised by the experience.  Alberto greeted us and was so very sweet!  Although I didn't really enjoy my entree as much as I hoped (the sauce was delicious, though!), I loved how they have a \"Christmas all year round\" theme.  A Christmas Tree made of Italian wine bottles and Christmas music no matter what time of the year!  If you're ever in Carefree, AZ, go to Alberto Italian...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family and I are in town visiting, and we happened to find Albertos. It was the best dinner any of us had in a long time. Authentic Italian, friendly service, keen attention to detail."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great attention to customers. The owner came around himself and talked to the customers which is rare these days. Genuine authentic Italian food and great selection of wine."}
{"text":"Alberto is one of the most gracious restaurant owners I've had the luck to meet. You can truly taste the love in his cuisine, that is made from scratch daily. The setting is casual, but don't let that fool you. Everything from the appetizers, salads, pasta dishes, pizza and desserts are first rate.  Alberto likes to share stories with customers and is very entertaining  Don't be fooled by the casual setting, this is Italian food at its best and is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"The best in Scottsdale.   Nothing more to say!  We have lived near carefree for 5 years and I am So mad we didn't try this before today.   Food and atmosphere was great.  Alberto is a gem."}
{"text":"One of the worst Italian restos I have been to. Totally over priced. Food was so bland I could not finish my portion. How can you mess up pasta and marinara? When it is $13.95.  Also, they seat the only three tables right next door and totally on top of each other. So you cant even have conversation without having the people next joining in. Pathetic.  Do not eat here, ever."}
{"text":"One star is actually too much in my opinion. My husband and I went to Alberto's early one evening, we asked what the restaurant was known for. It was suggested we get the penne Alberto and penne Arribiatta. We also got the Caesar salad and were given a complimentary cup of bean soup. To start, my diet coke tasted like chemicals.The soup tasted burnt and required a crazy amount of salt to even attempt to eat it.....I still couldn't eat it but told the waitress I didn't want to spoil my appetite. The Caesar salad was good but not great. My entree was terrible and so was my husband's, he asked for a taste of mine and actually said that as bad as it was it tasted better than  his. When the waitress asked how our food was I didn't have the heart to told get the truth BUT decided I also didn't want to pay for a meal that I felt was I inedible so when she came back and asked if I wanted to take my uneaten  portion home I decided to be honest with her. Although the waitress was very nice I felt it was condescending when she tried to explain that the sauce is made with fresh tomatoes insinuating that I didn't know what good sauce was.I don't like confrontations so I decided not to tell her that I grew up Italian, my grandfather's from Calabria,Italy and my husband'a family is from Naples. I not only know good Italian food, I cook really good Italian food and I kind of resent being told that I didn't know good food when I tasted it because this was NOT good Italian food. I would never go back. I think maybe this was once a Good place that has lost it's way OR we both happened to order the wrong thing. Or all the Yelpers have no taste buds. At any rate the penne dishes were not good,plain and simple.I rarely complain about bad food, I almost always pay my bill, say nothing and simply......never go back. We only went to this place because got a 4 1/2 star rating from Yelp. We can't imagine why it would get that rating."}
{"text":"We went last night for the first time with our daughter and future son in law.  We had lobster ravioli, lasagna, spaghetti with clams and chicken parmesan.  We all loved our dinner and we all had different homemade sauces that were beyond delicious.  We all said we would definitely go back.  The outside is not fancy but the inside is an adorable, authentic Italian restaurant.  Very reasonably priced.  Alberto and his staff were friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Authentic- Delicious Italian Food.  If you make it out to Cave Creek, this is the place to eat.  It's kinda tucked away so you have to plan to eat there to find it.  My father is an Italian Italian- you know from Italy and he really enjoys this restuarant.  As do I, but I am a bit Americanized.  The pasta is made perfectly al dente- how does he do it? I don't know.  I just eat it."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian cuisine. If you are looking for the real deal, this is the place. The flavors are delightful. Portions enough for another meal or two. Service was fast, friendly and professional. This is so refreshing."}
{"text":"Okay, picture yourself in a 1950s Italian restaurant. Terra cotta everywhere. Wooden chairs. Red checked linens. And even an authentic off-the-boat Italian owner, Alberto, who feels like a distant uncle who instantly greets you into his family.  Stepping into Alberto's Italian Restaurant feels like a step back in time. No gimmicks. No pre-fab menus. Just serious genuine Italian. Warm homemade bread. Pasta that Alberto made earlier that morning. Sauce that could make your legs turn to water it is so good.   There was a HUGE family party being held there the night we visited. Turns out it was someone's birthday and she said she couldn't have it anywhere else except Alberto's. Now that's saying something. There also was a small group - one of them was Italian (accent and all) and said that he was so happy to finally have true Italian food again. When we visited Italy several years ago, we thought, when are we going to have this wonderful food experience again? Thank you Alberto. You transported us back to the cobblestone streets of your youth."}
{"text":"The owner, Alberto greeted us at the door and took us to our reserve table.  The restaurant was quite charming.  Service was good and the food excellent.  My wife had the linguine with mushrooms and I had the carbonara, both were extremely well done and very large portions (we had the leftovers for dinner the next night).  We will certainly go back the next time we are in Cave Creek.  The only disappointing thing was we were not offered dessert ."}
{"text":"One of favorite places to eat in carefree/cave creek!  Caesar salad is a must try.  Always the most fresh ingredients used! Love this place Thank you Alberto for providing Such  fresh delicious food"}
{"text":"We were immediately greeted by Alberto when we walked in. The decor was casual and a bit quirky. My sister and I shared the seafood pizza and my fiance had the chicken parmesan.  I must say that my sister and I are both picky eaters and we both loved the pizza! Full of flavor and yet not so heavy. My fiance said the chicken parmesan was pounded thin and tasted really good. We ended with the tiramisu, which was full of rum! I wasn't a huge fan of the strong alcohol flavor, but that's just me. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This Yelp Elite is not impressed.  Very disappointed in this locally owned, authentic Italian restaurant.  Very expensive for the little amount of food you get.  Disappointed in the \"to go\" service.  The Frank Sinatra playing in the background can't help them out that much.  Not offering utensils, to go cups for the $3.50 cup of tea or cheese/red peppers are just basics but definite expectations for a $40 plus bill when all we ordered was a salad, calzone and 2 teas. Won't be choosing this establishment the next time we are in town and want Italian.  Oregano's around the corner sounds like a better deal and experience."}
{"text":"We were really exited when we walked into the restaurant a few weeks ago. It has a nice atmosphere and is clearly not a chain restaurant which is what we really liked about it.  The mediterranean starter plate was good and the pasta was decent as well. However, the Calzone I ordered was totally black on the top and bottom. I was surprised that it got served when it was clearly burned but gave it a shot and tried one bite. I could clearly taste that burned particles and complaint about it to the owner (I suppose).  The answer I got was that the often runs as 1400 degrees and that it is normal that the calzone is all black. Nevertheless, he took the food back and asked me what else I want. My answer was that I would like to get a not burned calzone which I got served approx 10 min later. The good news was that it looked like it was supposed to look but unfortunately it was not all done and had the almost raw dough on one side. I ate what was cooked and did not bother complaining again.  Long story short, we probably won't go back there even if it is conveniently located and we really liked the first impression."}
