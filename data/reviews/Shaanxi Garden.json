{"text":"This is not your neighborhood Chinese restaurant and you can't compare this to any buffet and even if you have been to China you likely had Americanized Chinese. This as close to the real deal as you are likely to get. The oil seared fresh noodles wee wonderful and only really spicy if you add hot oil.  The walnut shrimp were slightly sweet but very good.  Lots and lots to choose from, waitstaff prompt and kitchen service prompt. We will be back"}
{"text":"So far my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Authentic food, comfortable dining environment. Waitress are nice and food is delicious!!!! Recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Phoenix Area. Especially the walnuts shrimp, one of the must try's on the menu~"}
{"text":"Extremely good food. Especially, the noodle and the lamp soup are yummy! All my friends love it!"}
{"text":"The decor is interesting, the wait staff is super nice but you could tell they are not professionally trained.  It may have been the chef's day off because the food was definitely not 5 stars.  The walnut shrimp (as deep fried dish) was room temperature and cold.  The chicken appetizer was delicious but of the 3 sauces that came with it, only 1, the dry condiments, were authentic.  The other 2  were sauces that tasted like they came out of little plastic bags: the sweet and sour and the vinegarish...terrible, both too sweet and icky.  The food was tasty but presented more like home cooked than from a restaurant.  There is potential but the food is not ready for prime time.  Hope these are just beginner mistakes.  They need to make food that measure up to the beautiful bowls, chopsticks and part of the decor."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant here in the valley! Highly recommend crispy chicken and walnut shrimp! Worthy waiting!"}
{"text":"I really like the decoration at this place. They really use the future and the painting from China. And a lot of their food only available in this restaurant. Strongly recommend the walnut shrimp. Worth all of the wait. Their chinese burger thugs are special too. Recooked the lamb version"}
{"text":"Their food is extremely salty, and the special drink they make taste very very bad.None of their dishes comes with rice no matter how much you order.The prices are high,if you set your price that high at least make your food taste good.Never want to come back to this place!"}
{"text":"pretty bad experience in this restaurant......waiting an hour for the water but we still get nothing...... food price are expensive also"}
{"text":"Fantastic new edition to the authentic Chinese food scene in AZ.   The entire menu is \"unique\", I found myself surprised at the options that I've actually never seen before. The dish I had I had never seen in LA or here. It was dipping noodles with a light water broth, with veggies.   You dipped the hand made noodles into a mildly spicy chili sauce. BOMB AF.   The best part was the Vegan friendly options. My dish needed no alterations to be vegan. The waitress offered me options to make other dishes vegan. Loved the cold bean jelly noodles in chili sauce. Also vegan, and also fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant so bad. Because we are waiting for so long time then I had bad feeling. We were sit at here but no one helped us to order. After we ordered still wait for more than an hour to got the drinks. It's a trash!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start off with the pros of this new restaurant.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and the service was friendly and speedy.    The rest of the review is the con.........  Looking at the menu we had high hopes and was pretty excited.   We ordered the crispy chicken as an appetizer A Choy in garlic Flamming surf bullfrog Iron shovel beef tongue  And Ultra delight walnut shrimp  DID NOT GET ANY  RICE... how could you not at least offer this when 3 different chef special dishes were ordered???  The crispy chicken was fall off the bone tender and skin was pretty crispy. It was accompanied with a sweet and sour type sauce and some dried herbs. This was probably the best dish that we ordered.  The A Choy in garlic was flavorful and still maintain a crunch when it came out to the table. Minor complaint was that it was slightly too greasy.  The flamming bullfrog dish was a disappointment.  It came out in a big soup bowl and on top was A LOT of shezwan peppers and chili big the dish wasn't at all spicy just the typical numb your tongue from the peppers without much flavor.  Inside the broth was a lot of bean sprouts,zucchini, tofu and small slices of frog legs.   You had to basically go fishing for the frog legs in a sea of unnecessary broth. Feel that the dish would have been better in a smaller bowl with less broth since at the end we just gave up trying to scoop around in the bowl  The beef tongue dish was very flavorful and tasty but overall it was again a disappointment because it should have been more appropriately named iron shovel jalepeno with beef tongue.  There was nothing but jalepeno and a few slices of beef tongue thrown in.  If the ratio was a little more balance it would have been number 1.  I love walnut shrimp at most the asian restaurants, it's a dish that is pretty hard to mess up. However, Shaanx i was surprisingly able to do just that.  The plating was beautiful and was looking forward to my first bite, until I took the first bite.  There was way to much breading and the mayo sauce.  The breading itself was NOT crispy at all but more on the chewy side.  Once I stripped the shrimp from the excess it was just a regular size shrimp but It was made like they used jumbo size shrimp for the price they charged. One of the shrimp was actually not cooked all they way either...  It wouldnt have been so bad but the price was what made the experience not worth it at all, and the possibility of returning and giving them a second chance very minimal.  Our total for this meal was $88 without gratuity for only 2 people and we didn't even get full.  I'm just not sure if this was just one of thier off days..."}
{"text":"OMG I love this Chinese restaurant! The noodles is a must order item. All the dish are rarely seen in US and very authentic!"}
{"text":"This place makes delicious authentic Chinese food (not your Americanized fast food). I believe they relocated to this larger location (house of egg roll). The revamped interior design and menu itself is worth the visit. oxtail dish was amazing. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious noodles. I recommend the Biang Biang noodles or the \"you-po\" noodles which are made with authentic, handmade, Shaanxi style noodles, long and wide. I also enjoyed the saozi noodles which had an exciting spicy sour flavor. You're in good hands here!"}
{"text":"Well decorated place! Amazing food! North Western Chinese style. Very unique! Nothing like Panda Express or P. F Chang's. Real authentic Chinese food! Try their yum noodle dishes (#32 Mount Qi Noodles in Soup) on the menu) and Chinese sandwich with cumin lamb or spicy pork (#38)."}
{"text":"The cuisine here is very different from that of the Chinese restaurants - usually Cantonese - that most people in our area are accustomed to. The flavors from this region (Shaanxi province) are very strong and piquant, with generous use of prickly ash or Sichuan peppercorns, which is not surprising since Shaanxi is next to Sichuan province. The emphasis on spicy and sour and the fact that sugar is hardly used in this cuisine sets it apart from Cantonese. Since noodles are used more than rice in Shaanxi cuisine, it is fitting that their signature dish is Biang Biang noodles, which features wide noodles overlain with  slow-cooked pork, bok choy and root vegetables in a well-seasoned, strongly flavored spicy sauce. If you are not sure what to get during your first visit here, this dish is your gateway into the world of northwestern Chinese cuisine. The restaurant has a friendly young staff, a cool contemporary Asian vibe, and a very convenient location - it is on the northeast corner of Dobson and Main in Mesa, very close to the Main St./Sycamore stop of the Valley Light Rail."}
{"text":"This place does not take vegetarian considerations into account. And if you dine here, you WILL get sick because they cook their vegetarian dishes in the same pans as meat without rinsing them out! You can taste the pork in the vegetarian noodles! Good luck explaining this issue to the asians that work here with the language barrier!   They have a hard time understanding English so if you need anything more than a point and order entree, you will be in trouble. The dish I ordered was much too spicy and they couldn't understand the fact I wanted it less spicy. It was as if they loaded MORE jalapeño into the dish. They love using jalapeño as a filler for their food. (See my pic) Had high hopes for this place but it disappointed. The hand pulled noodle spot a few blocks down across from meekong has better noodles than this spot with better English being spoken. Food was okay but not worth this language barrier.  Workers were not only not proficient enough in English but also rude. I had to ask to get my water refilled every time, and they were giving me attitude for refilling my water so many times. It was their fault for making my dish so spicy I had to drink lots of water. All I got when I walked into the restaurant where stairs. Nobody greeted me but all the workers did all stare and look at me as I walked in, which made me feel uncomfortable. When I left, nobody said goodbye. They sure know how to treat a customer! I really ought to just give them one star, but the dishes had potential to be really great if the restaurant steps up their game. I give one extra star for potential."}
{"text":"Some friends recommend  the place . Place was busy at 6.00 pm . It was a young crowd mostly asians which was promising . We tried the dumplings  this skin was overcooked  and meat tasted  like something out of the freezer. There was no hot sauce on the table and the waitress did not understand  my request.  We then ordered  coconut  shrimp  . This was very greasy  and had no flavor.  The noodles bang was highly recommended . But it had no flavor  and the noodles were undercooked.  The walnut shrimp  had too much breading.  The prices were high and the service underwhelming.  We spent about  33 dollars a person. We will not return. They also charged us 2 % for using our credit card"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally eat here. I get here. Was given a menu. Tried to flag a waiter down, but no luck. Then a group was sat across from me. I sat there for 15 min and no one had come by to get my drink order nonetheless acknowledge me. By the time I got up to leave the table that was sat after me had received their drinks and was already ordering! The lack of service has ruined my experience. I am never coming back again."}
{"text":"This new location was tasty and great to visit.  The food is from a district in Mainland China.  The staff are friendly.  Come for lunch or dinner and enjoy some Chinese food with a more authentic flair."}
{"text":"Celebrating my hubby's b-day here. They even gave us free noodle bowl. My hubby visited China several times and felt the food is authentic."}
{"text":"Stop by after a long day at work because they were still opened.. They stop serving their noodles.. and it's an hour and a half before they close :/ but my waiter was great and very kind even though I left shortly after.. really wanted to try the biang biang noodles .. maybe I'll come back and try it some other day.. if I come back .."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is warm and noodles are very authentic!  Biangbiang noodle is highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place ever since we saw it under construction, and we finally got a chance last night. The food was excellent, and the service was friendly. I'm a vegetarian so I always worry a bit when I hear a place is authentic, but I found a delicious dish of noodles, mushrooms, tomatoes, and bok choy in a vegetarian sauce. My husband also liked his meal, which was dumplings filled with ground lamb in broth. Our total bill including two glasses of wine was under $40.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We watched this place be built... this our first time here.... OMGOODNESS! Everything is fresh and delicious!  You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from the west valley to check this place out. I ordered the spicy noodles dish and it was pretty good. The place is very authentic and had a great atmosphere. There was a live guqin player and she was fantastic. The waitress was  and super friendly. There were a ton of authentic food there so it may not be to everyones liking. I probably wouldnt make the hour drive just to eat at the place again but if i was in the area, I definately would."}
{"text":"Mei guo ren shuo pi hua. I do not understand how anyone can rate this place poorly. The most authentic Chinese food you can find as if it came straight from the middle kingdom itself. All the flavors are accentuated perfectly. I have come here multiple times and I must say the biang biang mian is a must have. I also recommend their sour lamb dumplings."}
{"text":"I ordered the Biang Biang (I think this is how you spell it) noodles today and the bowl portions are BIG (bowls are for two people not one). I also ordered the spicy lamb Chinese burger (it's an appetizer).  Prices are fair for the noodle orders. They give you a 10% discount if you pay with cash.  The service was okay. Our server did not come over to ask us if we needed our waters filled during our meal. Also our server did not help us pack up our leftovers to go. We went on off peak hours and during a long holiday weekend. Service was not busy at all."}
{"text":"We came in tonight at 6pm. They told us there will be a 15-min wait until the waitress can take our order. We were fine with it. We placed our order of 4 items.  Then after about half an hour we got our spicy pork burger and grilled oysters. Yeah, that was not a bad wait. THEN in the next 40 minutes after we got our two course, we witnessed other tables who came in later than us, getting all their food. We were still missing two of our main courses. I finally can not stand it anymore. I grabbed 3 different people trying to figure out what went wrong with our order. We grabbed The first waitress and asked if something was wrong with our order, she apologized and left.  The next person we spoke with was probably the owner or the manager since she was the only one who wasn't wearing an uniform, also apologized for the delay and promised she will figure out what's going on with our order. But she did not!!!   The third waitress we grabbed was actually our waitress. While she was explaining to us that somebody messed up our order. The manager interrupted our conversation and told our waitress to take other orders. That was bad bad service!  The food part:  We got spicy pork burger, grilled oysters, Beijing noodles and fish fillet soup. The spicy pork burger was decent. Sweet chili sauce for grilled oyster and Beijing noodles?  Just not the flavor I had in China, what that means is they are not authentic.  To be clear, all the staff who served us were super nice expect the one who didn't have a uniform on."}
{"text":"We need more place like this in Arizona!  I enjoy their menu selection very much.  Be adventurous when you order, try everything on their menu.  (I am afraid this is not the best place for people that always order egg rolls or potstickers when they go out for Chinese)"}
{"text":"The best shan xi foos you can find in the city, even better than the authentic ones in san francisco. Definitely thump's up"}
{"text":"I'm gonna start off by saying our Waitress was very friendly! My friend, his mom and myself didn't like the food! At all we thought it was gonna be your typical Chinese restaurant with orange chicken etc but the chicken looked weird veggies on beef cho tasted very old. Needless to say we had no more then a couple bites before we asked for the check."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. The oil seared noodle with pork is ridiculously good. And the honey baby back ribs. Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Staff very friendly and helpful.  We had the scallops with vermicelli, and the hand strewn noodles with garlic sauce.  We loved it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Best food and best service. I am from China and the food is here is 100% authentic."}
{"text":"The actual dishes are totally different from the pictures on the menu. Taste like careless home cooking. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Very authentic food! Want to try everything on the menu! The noodles are very good and can't find any other places sell the noodle!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! Authentic food from Shaanxi! It use to be \"House of Egg Roll\" and they recently moved to this location. The new place looks great, new menu items, same deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. I have never felt so unwanted in a restaurant. My mother and i went to have lunch together there yesterday and it took them 30 minutes to take our order. We received our soups and they were cold, our drinks weren't served until after our meals. It took 20 minutes after our soup for our entrees. Mine was missing the spring roll, which they never brought. The food was cold once again. They only gave us one set of silverware and never brought another. We had to ask for the check multiple times and we finally decided to stand near the register until they gave it to us. We were ignored and honestly discriminated against the entire time we were there. Will never return. On top of all of this i felt sick last night and now ive been throwing up all morning. Couldn't recommend this place any less."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Tasty authentic food with various delicate plates! A great combination of traditional northwestern Chinese food and ancient Shaanxi culture! Definitely worth to try and enjoy!!! And I'm sure you'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful menu & great food! We were looking for a great noodle restaurant and Shaanxi Garden hit the ball out of the park! The entire menu looks superb, so we can't wait to go back to try more.  Sorry that we went the take-out route. The ambiance is really nice. Next time is definitely dine-in."}
{"text":"I had heard of the noodles served at Shaanxi Garden as was anxious to give them a try. Five of us arrived at 6:00 to have dinner.   Ordered for appetizers and shared were Gizzards and non-spicy Squid. Both appetizers were covered in a grainy spice that was not very tasty. I had ordered Soybean Milk which helped to clear it from my palate.  Next was Oil Seared Noodles, which were acceptable at best. The Oil on them was not spared and served as a reminder of my having eaten them the next morning.   Another of our party who loves hot and spicy food ordered Fiery Pao Mo. He claimed that it was anything but fiery and did not finish eating the dish, stating that it had a funny flavor and had lots of granular seasoning on it.   The Biang Biang noodles were nicely cooked, but were only available in a few incarnations. The restaurant seemed to be out of many items from the menu.   As for drinks, one of our party ordered the QQ jelly, pronounced it as \"OK\", but did not finish it.   The venue is nicely decorated with music in the background from a live band.  Service was fair, with our waitress having a number of mix ups on orders due to language problems, though one cannot hold that against the restaurant.  If one is not used to Szechuan style cooking this may not be to everyone's taste. The province where this food is from is just next to Szechuan, hence the use of all the spice.  The restaurant was clean and bathrooms had proper supplies and cleanliness.  3 stars for cleanliness, atmosphere and serving authentic Biang Biang noodles as advertised."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear a restaurant had opened up serving cuisine from the Shaanxi Province. Time for biang biang noodles! (Or if you are Ricky Martin and William Hung, She Biangs, She Biangs)  We split the aforementioned biang biang noodles, four bowls of happiness, and Shaanxi delighted lamb soup. They were made so quickly, only a few short minutes and each dish looked deliciously appetizing. The biang biang noodles give you a lot of biang for your buck, since it one gigantic long noodle surrounded by broth, shredded pork, cubed vegetables, and bok choy. Unfortunately the whole dish was too salty for my tastes, and the potatoes in the vegetable mixture were undercooked. The noodles themselves tasted excellent, perfectly cooked with a great \"bite\" to them. I was indeed delighted to have the lamb soup, a contrast of delicate and bold flavors. The clear broth was accented with numbing Sichuan peppercorn oil, lightly seasoned, with hearty slices of lamb, and delicate rice noodles. I loved the variety of the four bowls of happiness, which offers crispy beef, meatballs, sliced pork, and marinated tofu.   While the servers were quick to seat us, place our order and deliver our food, we did need to request some basic items such as spoons and bowls for our meal.  The decor is nice at this restaurant. You can tell they put a some thought into making it into a contemporary update on more traditional Chinese style designs.   The menu is fairly extensive and there are definitely more dishes I'd love to try out here. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food! Great service and best food! Owner pays attention to details and the server cares about how customer feel"}
{"text":"Great authentic style menu, great service, food was excellent. Prices are really fair for food servings. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Walnut shrimp and iron beef tongue is my favorite dish here. And noodle is a must order!"}
{"text":"I really liked the decor in the restaurant. The servers were nice at the table but spent most of their time sitting at the bar talking to each other instead of checking on us. The menu is hard to navigate but this may be due to the fact that it's in both Chinese and English. Perhaps the format is more appealing to the Chinese reader. They had a set up that looks like they may have live music sometimes. None was playing while we were there. The appetizer and dessert was awesome! The entrees were good but different than you'd expect. For instants, the beef lo mein had one very wide giant noodle. Eating it with just chop sticks made it very messy and almost impossible. Also it was really oily. Overall I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"The food is just ok, but we were waiting about one and half hour for the food and drinks! Another table wait about an hour and they asked the waitress where the food are, the waitress told them if they don't want to wait anymore, they can just check for the drinks!!!!OMG! They were so angry!!!!"}
{"text":"What? Huh? How did we never know about this place until today? The best damn Chinese food in this part of the valley. Bar none. We'll definitely be coming back, and we'll be bringing the emptiest stomachs possible."}
{"text":"Super dope new Chinese restaurant! Careful as most of the dishes have a kick to them but they've still got a good balance in their flavors. The mount qi noodles and garlic dip noodles are great. Chinese burgers are awesome and they've really got a unique menu with options for vegans and carnivores alike. Staff is attentive and the restaurant itself is gorgeously decorated."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with delicious food. Xi'an style, with lots of lamb options. Nice warm soup, also some healthy soup/stew options."}
{"text":"Loved this place very much!!! With my husband and brother-in-law, had a great experience with unique food even for me who is Chinese and never had them before."}
{"text":"Amazing, even better than xian's famous foods in nyc. We had biang noodles, most of the chef's specials (dumplings in vinegar, pita bread with pulled pork, bread soup with beef brisket, and cold skin noodles). They were all super flavorful, spicy, and  hearty. Perfect for cold winter. Great prices too. The dishes are family style so come in groups!  They also have live music (chinese zither/harp instrument) and the guy was good."}
{"text":"The food itself was okay but a little bit too salty... portion is so-so.... enough for 2-3 people   i think they are a little pricy compared to other Chinese restaurants in the valley. We ended up paying around $30ish per person without getting super full so I rather pay 25.99 for all you can eat Korean barbecue until you couldn't take another bite...  Good thing is all of the servers are really nice and helpful.   Overall: it's okay but could be better. May not be coming back again"}
{"text":"This is all you need to know about this place.  Eat at your own risk..  http://www.azfamily.com/story/38282508/dirty-dining-may-25-mesa-restaurant-hit-with-a-whopping-12-health-code-violations"}
{"text":"This is very unique restaurant. I say that because they have many dishes that I have never tried before. I wanted to try everything but settled on a special that they had for Chinese New Year.   It was a lamb dish (bone in) served on a large metal bowl with warmer underneath. The flavors are not overpowering so the lamb taste came through nicely. Portion was large and had lots of potatoes, chestnuts and peppers. The gravy was nice when eaten with white rice. It was slightly oily but I think it was meant to be eaten this way. It was good and too bad they don't have this all the time.  Biang Biang noodle was delicious. The noodle was in a shape of large lasagne, wide and long. The pork was slightly salty which paired nicely with the chewy noodles. It also had chopped root vegetables and bok choy. It could get messy eating the oversized noodles but fun at the same time. Just don't order this when you're on a date.   Liang Pi cold noodles was also interesting. It was rice noodles served with plenty of bean sprouts and hot oil. I can see people liking this but for me it was too oily. Again, I think it was meant to be served with lots of oil.   Overall, enjoyed our meal here. I want to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and the food was AMAZING. My husband doesn't normally like Chinese food but he particular enjoyed the Mapo Tofu with Beef. Oh, he likes the decor, too.   This restaurant used to be House of Egg Roll in Chandler but the owners closed that location early this year. When my friends told me that the same owners re-opened it in Mesa, I was excited but didn't expect it to be any different. But they managed to kick it up a notch at the new location with a more extensive menu that showcases a lot of unique dishes. It definitely highlights a Chinese regional cuisine that is steeped in Chinese culture and history."}
