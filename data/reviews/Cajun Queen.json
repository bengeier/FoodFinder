{"text":"We came to eat to celebrate our anniversary (this as one of our first dates 14 years ago).  I called over a month ago to make the reservation and explained the purpose of our visit and asked if they could do anything for us when we came.  We arrived that night and were seated quickly.  Very crowded, very loud.  I didn't remember that from the last visit several years ago until we sat down and it came back to me very quickly.

The Waiter seemed distracted, but we managed to get our order.  The fried crawfish were great as a starter.  We then decided to get a few more appetizers and one entree to split.  When the gumbo came, we both decided it tasted like spicy water.  There was no flavor at all.  Even the shrimp had no taste.  It almost tasted like it was diluted to make it last the night or had just been sitting in the pot way too long.  I mentioned it to the waiter and he commented that he has never had it and that the main items are made in such large quantities, he didn't expect it would be very good.  What?!  Why would the waiter say that instead of \"I'm sorry sir, can we get you something else?\"

The rest of the meal was okay.  The Diane had more chicken than anything else (about 2 shrimp and 2 crawfish to go with three chicken breasts).  It lacked any flavor either and was kind of mushy.  The oysters were good and the crawfish scampi was good, but a bit on the greasy side.

The waiter never asked if we enjoyed our meal and never even said thank you for visiting.  He dropped off the ticket, picked it up and brought it back without saying word.  Customer service is just as important as the food, so that rates 0 stars.  He looked like we were in his way since we were only a 2 topper and he was losing money with us when he had other larger tables in his section.  The manager even walked by us several times and didn't even ask about our meal or acknowledge us.

Overall, we were very disappointed at the experience.  It seems like they are running on their reputation and haven't done much to maintain or improve over the years.  We have eaten here since I arrived in Charlotte in 1996 and have had events there, etc.  This visit will change my mind of a repeat visit.

Oh, by the way, no one even mentioned our anniversary when I specifically asked when I made that reservation a month ago.  That is a big no-no."}
{"text":"We went for early dinner yesterday shortly after 5:00 pm. The place was empty and the hostess tried to usher us to the back of the building to a corner as we admired the gorgeous fireplace and the empty room. We put the brakes on and elected to occupy the best table in the house. We then witnessed a small parade of people refusing to sit in the \"back of the bus\" also. 

It was down hill from there. The waiter had the personality of, well, actually he didn't have one. The service could be described in one word, horrible. We had a groupon to rid our selves of and that's the only reason we didn't casually get up and walk out immediately. We ordered and within two or three minutes, our food arrived. Thankfully the bowls were warm and it was the only item that was warm. The food had very good flavor but the temperature was cool at best. We waited for a moment to see if Mister Personality would at least peek in on us to see if everything was satisfactory. Unfortunately, not to our surprise, he never checked on us the entire cold food meal. Normally, i would have insisted on a manager for some type of explanation but we decided to count our losses and endure it and never, ever return. 

Considering this is a service industry and the waiters depend on tips as a return for excellent service, we wonder how he makes a living. My wife constantly reminds me of how I tip above and beyond 20% even when it's not warranted, but i took pride in giving this waiter exactly what he gave us.  

I can only hope he was having a bad day and we found him in a moment he was not ready for our company. Maybe it was the electric blue shirt i was wearing, maybe? See where this is going? I'm not going there totally but it made us wonder what his issue was with us. Did we fit the \"stereotypical they don't tip\" profile? Well, guess what, we gave him the results it appeared he was looking for. Parental Tough love is what he was shown. \"Son you must treat everyone with respect or you will not be rewarded!!

Our experience versus some of the other revues here makes us wonder how the service industry has fallen to mediocrity being accepted as the normal standard. Sad, very sad."}
{"text":"The \"Complimentary Valet\" came with the complimentary attitude as well. The entire experience of the restaurant starts the second you get out your vehicle. We were greeted with, \"You can just park your car right there\" - taking away for the service that we are supposedly getting \"Complimentary\". Fast forward to the food - the choices & portions attached with their magical seasonings are amazing! The service took a bit longer than expected and two tables were served and received their food before we did & we had a reservation. W elect the waiter a minimal tip mainly because we felt as though our orders & the items we needed prior to receiving our food were not met within a timely fashion. Secondly, we asked a guy who was just walking the floor to see if he had an idea of how long our food would take. He said he had no idea; not offering to even check. My friend then responded, \"Do you think you can go & find out then....?\" He then came back & stated that it was on its way. The \"on its way\" comment was followed by an additional 15 minute lag time. After dinner, we were met in the parking lot with a different Valet Attendant & I proceeded to hand him our ticket for my vehicle. I told him, \"I can actually go & grab it myself because it's right there\", (pointing about 10 feet to the right). He stated, \"That's not your car\" & before he could even hand me the keys, the car horn sounded notifying that it was my vehicle & all I exited the conversation with was a \"Thanks\". I left him a tip mainly because he was light skinned and cute. Overall, I'd go back there. I could just do without the Valet & possibly a more socially conscious waiter."}
{"text":"The crawfish scampi and Tilipia with crawfish topping was awesome as always, extremely consistent, exception being the gumbo, it is not typical Louisiana roux based gumbo, I will not order again. I also only give 4 stars, as Brandon, our Server, must have had something or someone else on his mind as he barely had us on his mind. Next time we will ask for Samantha, or Sam, best server in the house."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The fried clams were fresh and were the best 'Ive ever had.  Great neighborhood. Perfect for Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"A delish Sunday brunch! I didn't think prices were high for what we enjoyed (okay, maybe a bit steep on the beignets, but those are worth it). My partner's banana bourbon french toast was a sugar bomb in the best way, and I could actually taste the bourbon in the ooey gooey syrup. My crab cakes benedict was perfectly cooked. The crab tasted fresh, not stale or dry, and the eggs were just right. It also came with a nice side of fruit. Overall, for $12 it my benedict was a bang up brunch plate."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday without a reservation. We were told that it could be an hour wait. But the hostess was very unfriendly, it was our first visit there and did not feel welcomed at all. We ended up no eating there. I don't care how good your food is if staff is unfriendly I  am not going in there. We drove back to our go to place Razzoo."}
{"text":"The service was great!! Olivia was quick and friendly. She suggested the Diane for me since I've had some bad time with Etoufee at other restaurants. And that was MARVELOUS. I love mushrooms and the spice is off the chain. If you are on a diet, don't get the Asian, let's say BUTTER! My boyfriend had the Creole and he liked it with the Shrimp, it could not top my chicken. The Crawfish Scampi for appetizer I could have ate with rice as a dish!!!! The food was great and FREE VALET, but they work off tips so tip well. I definitely will be coming back until I learn how to make the DIANE sauce"}
{"text":"The fried oysters appetizer is super yummy as is the Diane with rice, shrimp and crawfish. Great atmosphere. Made reservations and were good to go as soon as we arrived, which has always been the case when I've made reservations here. Highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"We had to visit Charlotte's best cajun joint before we headed home to NYC. 4 stars for the haunted black magic atmosphere of the restaurant. Even in broad daylight, the dining hall had a dark shrouded vibe going on. The beignets let me down a little bit but the shrimp & grits more than made up for it. The fried popcorn shrimp was also very well done but the highlight for me was the shrimp & grits."}
{"text":"Nice place, great food, what more can you ask for, just to let you know this is fine dining so be prepare to pay a little"}
{"text":"When I came to Charlotte in 2009, Cajun Queen was one of the first restaurants I visited.  The food was amazing!!!  When family and friends came to town I took them there. They all raved about the food.  The past three times have been very disappointing!  I went there yesterday for dinner. The service was good the food not so much.  I ordered the Etouffée with all three my sister ordered the Diane with chicken and shrimp.  We both were unhappy with our food and the basket of biscuits that were rock hard. I don't know if there is new management or they're cutting back on seasonings to cut cost.  Either way I will not go back. Sad, I really liked this place!!"}
{"text":"This place was a classic, like so many others that have just run out of steam. Lost their mojo so to speak. (Maybe cause the tree out front is gone.) 

My advise, drink up in the bar and in a few hours it want really matter if the food is great or just okay."}
{"text":"This was my favorite joint in the CLT.  I have never been to New Orleans, and because of Katrina, I probably  won't for awhile, but I imagine that this is a pretty good joint even by looziana standards.  I always get the blackened platter with chicken and the fish special with one of their rotating toppings, usually  one with crawfish and corn and a side of gumbo.  MMMMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"It was more than a good meal, it was a great experience. We recently visited New Orleans and loved the culture and food.  Cajun Queen perfectly seasoned / spiced dishes made us feel like we were back there again. A gem without a doubt in Charlotte with impeccable attentive service.  We will be back and refer them to others."}
{"text":"I am only in Charlotte occasionally, but I must come here every time. The crawfish is as good as any in New Orleans. The staff is great. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"We had our first visit last night. Fun, jazzy band, great atmosphere, but the food was the star of the show. Fried green tomatoes, BBQ shrimp, shrimp and grits, fried oysters... all excellent. Fast, polite, unobtrusive service, too. We'll definitely be back. A+"}
{"text":"When you're running out of date night locations and your significant other is getting tired of Domino's cheap weekday carryout deals, it's time to treat her to a fancy restaurant. Preferably one that constantly offers $20 for $40 online coupon deals like Cajun Queen does.

The location is very nice - it looks like a converted home with outdoor patio seating and an enclosed back porch for when the weather is nice. There's live music most nights and a bar upstairs if you just want to sit and enjoy a cocktail or two while you wait for a table.

The food was excellent - we got the Cajun BBQ shrimp as an appetizer and couldn't stop raving about it. Save your dinner rolls to mop up the delicious juice! Ask for another basket when they drop the shrimp off! We ordered gumbo too just to splurge but it seemed bland in comparison to that excellent BBQ shrimp juice.

I always feel bad waiting sitting through a waiter's shpeel about the daily specials and not ordering one so I ordered a steak special and my lady got chicken Diane. The steak was cooked medium rare as requested with craw fish etoufee and hearty mash potatoes riding shotgun. The chicken Diane's gravy was rich, flavorful and tasted fantastic. The portion sizes were enough to feel full and take enough home for meals the next day.

The service was excellent as well - our server was very personable and friendly. He make jokes, answered our questions about the menu, and never kept us waiting long when we needed something. 

The entrees at Cajun Queen are around the $20 range which makes it really easy to blow your Groupon for a date night. In addition, there's a $5 charge for splitting an entree. I'll definitely be buying another coupon for Cajun Queen. The prices are a little beyond making it a regular spot (even with a coupon) but it's perfect for a memorable date night."}
{"text":"I had not heard of this place until I saw the Groupon for it and purchased it to try something new.  I had no idea what to expect after I went on their website, oddly I didn't read Yelp reviews first (which I normally do).  I went with a friend and we split the fried oyster appetizer, suggested by our waiter and I got the shrimp diane, also a recommendation of our waiter. We ate upstairs and the bar area wasn't too busy since we went during a week night so we had very good and attentive service. Everything I ordered which I finished off with bread pudding dessert was extremely tasty, so much that I am still thinking about it today which is why I am leaving this review! I have already recommended this place to others and can't wait to go back.  The Groupon deal they run for $25 worth of $40 makes it a great deal too.  However, I don't need a Groupon to go back!"}
{"text":"I was quite excited to finally come here after purchasing the Google Offer, and overall, I think I got my $15 dollar's worth. The appetizer (crawfish scampi) was tiny, but delicious. The fried shrimp was very nicely done -- not battered to death. Shrimp \"Diane\" looked yummy, with plenty of onion and mushrooms. My entree, Crawfish Etouffee, was really good (though I should have tried it with some of the spices on the table), but later on, didn't quite agree with my stomach. I don't typically eat shellfish, so that is most likely the reason. I would have tried one of the fish entrees, but they're pricey. Our server Bob was okay, but kind of standoffish sometimes.

The most disappointing part was that NONE of the seafood is domestic. Bob was amused that I asked, but considering seafood is their speciality, you would think they'd take sustainability and safety seriously. http://www.montereybayaquarium.org//cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=18"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful. I had the Diane with shrimp and my husband had the salt and pepper catfish. Both dishes were great!!"}
{"text":"We made reservations online for 7:15; arrived around 7:00 and were seated within 10 minutes. Service was outstanding! We never waited for drink refills; the staff was always on top of it, even though the place was packed. Fried Green tomatoes for an appetizer was perfect! We split the Chicken Diane - delicious! Bourbon pecan pie for dessert. Great dinner, great music, atmosphere was on point. We did sit in the same room as the band (which we requested) so it was a little loud to be having conversation but we enjoyed the music very much. Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to the Cajun Queen this weekend and I really enjoyed the Shrimp Étouffée it was just spicy enough and was a really big portion.  My wife does not like Cajun food and had the steak it was probably the worst steak I have ever had, the spice on it tasted funny.  Overall I was happy I had a groupon and would only go back for takeout."}
{"text":"Super good food. The BBQ shrimp is to die for. Make sure you get the bread to soak in the juices! I could eat that as a meal. The etuffe was very well done and my husband couldn't keep his hands off my entree  (no pun intended!). The bread pudding is the real thing too! Go ahead of time and hang out for a while. We enjoyed the love music but they only played for 30 min per hour. Was hoping for a more continuous roll. But can't complain. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Parking sucks. First time here and our waiter forgot literally everything. Ordered a beer and asked for a chilled glass, never came out. Told us all entrees came with salad or soup, never came out. Never was offered bread and didn't realize it until we were leaving. Every time we had to ask for something, he never gave us a chance to ask or talk because he would whisk away quickly. Also the hostess asked if we had reservations... Lol, it was 3 o'clock on a Sunday? Food was okay."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in Charlotte 20 years ago.  Many new restaurants have come to town since then...and this is still my favorite.  The food is authentic, the ingredients are fresh and high-quality, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"The food, at least what we had, the chicken diane and the biscuits and gravy, were excellent!  Full of flavor, fresh, great portion size. Really delicious!  The service was great too. The décor and atmosphere however, leave a lot to be desired. Very tired, worn out, drab, old. I would go back though, the food was awesome."}
{"text":"One of the best go-to Cajun restaurants in Charlotte. Terrific gumbo.  I go for the crawfish etouffee every time!"}
{"text":"Good music, great atmosphere, and awesome food!! If you haven't been to New Orleans this place is the closest you will come to it in this city. The blackened fish with rice and beans  is my favorite. The drinks are on point.. I always have a great time here!!"}
{"text":"I went to cajun queen with some friends from work a while back. I had the Diane, which people seem to be raving about on yelp. It was okay. I found the favors to be very mild and uninteresting; there was no spicier or complexity to the meal. The live music was nice but makes me wonder if this place would be appropriate for a quiet, romantic dinner. I will probably give cajun queen another try just in case it was an off night."}
{"text":"The food and portions were great!  In fact,  a wonderful evening out with my husband during restaurant week was perfect until my vehicle was sideswiped while dining.  There servers were polite and very accomodating."}
{"text":"The vibe was really nice.  There was a jazz band there that was awesome and not over powering while eating.  And our waitress was totally awesome.  The best server I've had at any restaurant in a long time.  I will definitely recommend to friends and family that ask for such type food and good service."}
{"text":"I am not a big Cajun Food connoisseur but I know what a good étouffée tastes like after a few visits to New Orleans and having eaten it at other places.  We wanted to try this place as the reviews were really good. The service was just good -  the live Jazz music OK and the food was disappointing to say the least. 3 stars for the ambiance."}
{"text":"My wife and I haven't checked out to many cajun restaurants since we moved to Ft. Mill several months ago.   The problem is we've been to Nawlins on at least three occasions and sampled low country food in Charleston, SC on several visits, so although the food was pretty good, it doesn't compare to what we have experienced in NO.  We are still glad we gave it a try."}
{"text":"After waiting and waiting this week me and my spouse finally went to cajun queen and in my opinion it was just ok. We had the barbque shrimp which was ok fresh shrimp in a spicy sauce. My boo did save his dinner rolls for the juice. He had the fried shrimp which was good i had a steak which was ok with potatoes that were ok and bland broccoli. I alsohad gumbo which was not very good. Overall it was ok but fo
r 80 i have had better"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Food is always good and service is always great! Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We love the Queen and once again we were not disappointed. Outstanding all the way around. One of the best ambiance restaurants I have ever been in. Highly recommend the crawfish scampi appetizer and blackened or fried catfish. Their complimentary valet parking is the icing on the cake. Great place!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable dining experience.  The service was friendly and timing was good.  Food was very good quality and taste.  Serving quantities was adequate.  Nice menu selections and drink offerings.  Highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Service was quick from the valet to the seating and food. The food was just right! The blackened catfish was awesome."}
{"text":"Terribly busy during the weekend evenings and the service seems to suffers. But not their fault because they seem to overbook themselves to the point of having customers wait for a while at the upstairs bar. We waited about 20 minutes for a reservation to be ready. The bar was packed and had only one bartender, so it was also very slow.

That said, the food was really AMAZING. Best Cajun place outside of New Orleans, by far. Definitely worth a visit. The Diane and Etoufee dishes are really great. Went there again on a Sunday afternoon and the service was much better.

The drinks are outstanding too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm atmosphere and delightful jazz band playing as we ate!  It's nice to have Cajun food so close to home."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sunday brunch...Alex is an awesome server who knew everything about the items on the menu.  Bananas Foster French Toast... Best. Ever."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I bought a groupon spend $20 get $40 so a few of us went to check it out.  They had a live jazz band upstairs which was great.  We shared fried green tomatoes, calamari and chicken/shrimp creole.  It was all fabulous.  Definitely a great girls night or date night place!  I took my husband there last week and he loved it!"}
{"text":"Cajun Queen was everything the reviews said it was.  The food portions were huge! The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great Brunch on a very rainy morning. Wait staff was friendly and helpful in every way. And food was excellent. Don't skip the Benet's that come with a strawberry sauce as a starter for all to share; they were delicious! As were the Fried Green Tomatoes appetizers. The eggs Benedicts were great and famous shrimp and grits. No complaints. Very delicious food, prepared to perfection. Will definitely come back. Thank you Cajun Queen."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Went with my gf on a random Monday.  The food, service, and live music was all great.  Drinks were beyond strong.  The seating is a little close, but I still loved it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte, bar none.  My wife and I have been at least a couple dozen times over the years.  The crawfish scampi is my favorite appetizer/side dish I've ever enjoyed, at restaurants ranging from greasy spoons to upscale steakhouses.  Savory, delectable, and delicious.  It's the kind of dish I could eat every single day.  Make sure to soak up the remaining sauce with your bread. 

I believe we have had every entree on the menu at one time or another, but my favorite has to be the crawfish etouffee.  Generous portions of crawfish paired with a perfectly spiced roux over rice.  It never disappoints. We just got back from New Orleans and had this same dish at 3 or 4 different well-reviewed restaurants, and none of them, in my opinion, bested Cajun Queen's."}
{"text":". Great live music and food and drinks , a must go back to restaurant in Charlotte asap , watier was Very good and food was alsome."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant quite often several years ago when I lived here in Charlotte. The service was always great, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere and music were very enjoyable. Needless to say, my expectation level was high. The complimentary valet is a plus as it used to be a nightmare to park there. The hostesses weren't very friendly nor was the front of the house manager when we walked in. We were taken to our tiny table shoved up against the wall. Our two top was VERY close to a 5 top with barely any room to move. Our waiter came over pointed to the restaurant week menu and walked off. I should have foreseen then how the evening was going to go. The waiter finally came back and abruptly took our drink order. He brings my wine and walks away without saying a word and then comes back 5 minutes later with my husband's wine. We ordered the exact same thing so why it took so long for the other glass is beyond me. The waiter comes over and rudely asks what do you want! I ordered the Caesar salad which was straight out of a bag with dried out lettuce and croutons hard enough to break a tooth. My husband got the gumbo and thought it was good. I ordered the etouffee with shrimp and crayfish as my entree and my husband ordered the shrimp and grits. The sauce was tasty and not to spicy. There were probably 5 tiny overcooked shrimp pieces , 10 tiny crayfish pieces, and a plate full of rice. The rice overpowered the entire dish. The shrimp and grits had very well done shrimp and bland grits. A guy came over and removed my wine glass without asking if I was finished or if I would like another glass. Our waiter never once checked on us while we were eating to see if we needed anything or how our dinner was. After someone else clears our plates without asking, our waiter comes over and says he guesses we are ready for dessert so what did we want. He brought the desserts out and let's say they didn't look very appetizing. The bread pudding did not look appealing but it tasted ok. The key lime pie crust was greasy and awful tasting. The filling itself was ok but didn't have much of a key lime taste to it. The waiter brings over our check and lays it on my husband's napkin and walks off. We hadn't asked for the check yet and he surely didn't ask if we wanted anything else before he dropped it off. We are excellent tippers as I used to wait tables myself and my husband worked in the restaurant industry. Our waiter did not deserve a tip of any kind other than to find another industry to work in as food service is not for him. We felt rushed the entire time and we were in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour. The area we sat in had 6 tables total and all but 1 of those tables was still occupied with people that were not eating or drinking when we left. They had already finished their dinner and drinks and a couple tables even had their to go boxes on the table. We were looking for a nice, relaxed dinner and that certainly didn't happen. We don't plan on returning that is for sure. We received better service from the valet attendant than we did in the restaurant itself. The guy ran over and got our car right away because he said he didn't want me to stand out in the cold for to long. He was very kind and considerate and was well tipped. There are so many great restaurants in Charlotte but unfortunately this is no longer one of them!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Cajun food is my favorite, so I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes down to it. 

I started off with a BBQ shrimp appetizer, which had a great flavor, but the shrimp was a bit overcooked.  I also got a cup of gumbo, which I was very unimpressed with. Something was off with the flavor. Maybe I caught a bad batch of it, but I won't be ordering that again.  

For my dinner I had the etouffee trio with crawfish, chicken, and shrimp.  The chicken was amazing.  Perhaps the best I have ever had.  It was very tender and the flavor was awesome.  The shrimp and crawfish were pretty darn good too.  I also tried some of the blackened catfish, which was cooked perfectly, but the seasoning on it was nothing special.  Luckily they had two of my favorite beers to wash it down with, Abita Golden and Purple Haze.  

I like how the restaurant is laid out.  It has a nice ambiance to it, and looks great both inside and out.  The prices are a little expensive, but you do get a good amount of food, so I would say overall it's worth it.  If I had the option, I would have given it a 4.5 / 5 rating, but they definitely have some things to improve upon if they want to reach 5/5."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch menu offers reasonably priced items that are so delicious. We had some beignets (so good) and the crab cake eggs Benedict (amazing). 

TIP: When making your reservations ask to be seated upstairs or away from the downstairs bathroom. We were seated near the downstairs bathroom and kitchen entrance. My chair kept getting hit by servers and guests who were walking to the kitchen and/or bathroom. A small change that could probably make a big difference in your experience."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, having a restaurant in a kind of living family house, but that is common for the upscale Elisabeth area in Charlotte. Very good food, not quite Southern as in Louisiana but very close. Very friendly staff and quick service. Had to visist my hometown to go there, shame on me since I lived 5 years in Charlotte and never went eating there. We had a great time and can recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband has been trying to get me to go for ages. I made reservations for roof top but as the weather was unpredictable we were seated upstairs. We had a great time, the live music was great, food delicious and service was excellent! Would definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Service was timely. The Restautant is so loud you can't hear yourself think let alone carry on a conversation. If Cajun food is your goal, it's perfect. If you are looking for social interaction with friends, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"BBQ shrimp app was amazing!  Our first time and requested upstairs to hear the jazz band. Great experience and food was true to the cajun experience."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for a quick business trip, I found this gem on Yelp. My waitress Hanna seemed genuinely excited that this was my first time there and recommended several dishes, all of which didn't disappoint. Started with the BBQ shrimp, spicy yet tasty; sop the sauce with the bread. Next up, blackened pork tenderloin with fried plantains. 3 good sized medallions with an interesting bean chorizo sauce. The plaintains were battered with cornmeal and were very good. I also asked for a single filet of the salt and pepper catfish, which was very good also. Ended the meal with key lime pie. Overall the dining experience went well. I would come back next time in town to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I have been to Cajun Queen Twice and have enjoyed my meal both times. The portions are enough for two to share. I ordered the fried catfish last night and got two big pieces of fish which was way more than I expected. It was well seasoned with a lightly fried coating which didn't flake. My husband order a dish (Diane something) which consisted of crawfish, shrimp, and chicken) which was amazing. We both had plenty of leftovers to go. Our server Justin was on point and very attentive. I usually don't remember names but he was awesome. I love the quaintness of this place. The Groupon deal is awesome. Not sure how long they plan on running this deal but I would go back despite the deal."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, staff and food. Beau, our waiter, was extremely knowledgable about the menu and the wine. I suggest what Beau suggested...the pork medallions with pineapple pico and plantains. Amazing!  We sat on the upstairs patio and had a perfect evening.  Can't wait to eat there when we visit Charlotte again!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time- heard its like new orleans food. Nice and spicy which im not a huge fan of spicy but i tried their chicken diane and ate the whole thing! Good portion for price!!!

Sat in the sunroom with only a few tables filled was a great atmosphere with a few friends. they have their own parking lot so its easy access. Theyre always on groupon too!"}
{"text":"i looked over their Living Social coupon. It said good only Sunday-Thursday, which was fine because I was going on Sunday. I read the fine print, and it said the usual jargon, but that it was excluded on Fat Tuesday, and Valentine's Day. Since today is neither of those days, I bought the coupon, and drove the 30  minutes to the restaurant. I get there and there is a huge sign on the door say they won't be taking the coupons during Restaurant Week, which is still going on. Would have been nice had they listed that on the actual Living Social coupon, as it only said just Fat Tuesday and Valentine's Day. I didn't even bother going on. I was so annoyed about the lack of communication on the actual LivingSocial form I just requested a refund."}
{"text":"I love the cajun queen! It is in my top 10 faves in Charlotte. The service is not always the best but the food more than makes up for it! It can be a little pricey but the portions are a good size and full of seafood!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner on a Thursday night. Atmosphere was nice. Nice and cozy.  Although, It was very dark, so dark that I had to use the flashlight on my phone to see the menu. The band was a disappointment. Pretty dull much older gentleman playing. The fried green tomatoes were delicious. The fried catfish and the red beans and rice were bland and lacked seasoning. My husband had the blackened catfish which was very good. Service was excellent. Overall it was just an ok experience. We probably wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. The atmosphere was nice. I ordered the chef's special cajun pasta and was pleased by the large portion. Making a reservation as the place was really crowded on a Thursday evening. I recommend eating here to people who enjoy creole food."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business. 

The good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp, the sauce with bread dipped in.

The bad: Food is mediocre. We had the Cajun popcorn, which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good, but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place, uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo, There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless. We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits. The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth. The shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture. 

The final insult: the grits. Grits are a favorite food of mine. I'm a southern girl and make real deal, bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant, \"add boiling water to reconstitute,\" grits. Culinary blasphemy.

I will not return. If you want real grits, go to Mert's Heart and Soul."}
{"text":"Ambiance, atmosphere, service, food... all exceeded expectations. The complimentary valet also add a nice touch. Making reservations on an early Friday evening should allow you to capture the experience at its best. ciao!"}
{"text":"It has an amazing atmosphere and very unique. Our server was very polite and was on top of everything, even the hostess was great she found us seats upstairs near the live music and the food was everything I expected and more. It makes you feel like New Orleans in Charlotte...we're already planning our next dinner here, I definitely recommend the restaurant as a must visit"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite restaurants! Everything is always so good, staff is friendly and service is great! I usually order the barbecue shrimp dinner and my husband gets the étouffée. We have ordered other things off the menu and were not disappointed, but there is just something about our normal order that we can't get enough of. We have tried other cajun restaurants in Charlotte and they pale in comparison to the Queen. Don't waste your time going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My wife and I always have a wonderful time at the Queen.  This time we took a friend of mine from Indy out for dinner and as usual the meal and sevice shined."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, great ambiance, band and food.  We especially loved the BBQ shrimp. Our server told us we had to order and then brought out extra bed to mop up the amazing sauce. Will go again and again!"}
{"text":"I'd probably give 3 1/2 if I could but I'm going to give 4 stars for excellent service... love the live music every night, great drinks, outdoor patio.  I like the old house. It feels like going over an old family members house but better. 
The food was good overall.  Appetizers Bbq shrimp sauce is great with bread and the Crawfish ceviche was flavorful and spicy!  So when my gumbo came it tasted blah to me. Not very flavorful.  So my dad ate it and liked it. My shrimp and grits were ok but the shrimp was bland and the skin on my sausage was hard. My sister had the dish several times before and said it didn't taste the same. Liked the grits though. tasted the blackened catfish... moist and delicious. Tasty desserts, but nothing to write home about. I do think it's a bit overpriced. 

The restroom paper towel machine was broken. And no other dryer or towels available. I know is out of their control but maybe need a backup.  It's quite annoying.

Great place for appetizers, live jazz and drinks."}
{"text":"The food was delish. The service was great. Complementary valet parking.The app crawfish bbq was my favorite.  I would give it 5 stars if there was not so much sauce on the entree. My husband got a porkchop and i got fish and both were just drenched in sauce. Overall delish and i will be back. wine and beer selection wasn't amazing but good enough to please the masses."}
{"text":"The Cajun Queen is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Their crawfish etoufee is amazing, and their creole shrimp/ chicken is mouth-watering! I also love going their when they have live music."}
{"text":"I travel to Charlotte frequent for business and must say that all of my Business Associates and I truly enjoy the food at the Cajun Queen.  The craw-fish scampi and barbeque shrimp are excellent as starters.  The daily specials are usually phenominal.  I recently had the mahi special which I have ordered on multiple occasions.  The Duck special is also great...well prepared and very flavorful.   The environment is somewhat noisy at times and with the tight spacing can be a distraction.  I would highly recommend a visit if you are in town as I don't believe that you would be disappointed.  Enjoy
MB"}
{"text":"My first time. Good good good atmosphere but I only gave 4 stars because the live Jazz band only plays 10 mins at a time and then takes 20 to 30 min breaks constantly."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went here for her birthday weekend and it was great. I was a little hesitant because I'm not real big on spicy/cajun food, but surprisingly I enjoyed everything about this place. The place is a house turned into a restaurant and has that cool New Orleans french quarter feel. 

The fried pickles are AMAZING!! The Diamond watch out!! I had the blackened catfish with mashed potatoes and it was delicious. I was shocked that I had two pieces of fish as well which was even better. My friend had étouffée and she enjoyed her meal as well. I will definitely be back here again for some more yummy spices!!"}
{"text":"Poor showing from the the Cajun Queen last night.  Haven't been in several years, and I won't return after last night.  Service was good, food and drinks where unacceptable. 

Gumbo caused indigestion for all a that indulged. Entrees looked like they had fallen victim to severe budget cuts. 

Ordered call brand liquor, would bet I received well liquor. 

Entertainment dollars could be better spent dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"First visit to a Cajun Queen, definitely not the last. It was restaurant week and they had a great deal on their meals. I had the gumbo, blackened tilapia and bread pudding. Oh and a glass of Chardonnay...all for $30. Soooo good! My husband had the shrimp and grits the Nate as of tilapia. The atmosphere was great. After the meal we went up to the bar. If you want strong margaritas, you will definitely get it. I'm looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"OMG -  love love love this place!  Been to CQ a minimum of 15x.  Never had a bad experience.  Staff, music, and food is great!  The blackened catfish in ridiculously good!!
And the fried green tomatoes are a great starter!"}
{"text":"Awesome, delicious food!  My favorite place to eat when I have the money.  Love the cajun popcorn and the dinner specials.  If they ever have the mahi-mahi as a special, get that! So good, I wanted to cry! Also ask your server about the ghost.  I heard some cool stories!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just good food and good service, great value.

I had the crawfish etouffee.  Deep flavor, good portion; chased with a Louisiana craft beer.  It hit the spot.

I also had a crawfish scampi that was a little too garlicky for me, but I ate it with a dinner roll and it was fine.  I was able to order a Caesar salad for just $3.  It was simple, but pretty good.

The restaurant itself looks like someone's house, and you do get a southern neighborhood feel when you step in.  

Evidently they have live jazz some evenings, so if I'm back in town I'll check out."}
{"text":"We went for brunch. Service was a little slow and food was just okay. I ordered shrimp and grits which was okay and my partner ordered French toast which was tasty but burned a little on edges and needed a little more sauce."}
{"text":"I would absolutely recommend anyone wanting to visit to make prior reservations. It's an intimate environment set up in a converted home.  We ordered appetizers consisting of cajun popcorn((crawfish tails), fried green tomatoes, and Nawlins BBQ shrimp. They all were delicious! The BBQ shrimp was the all time best!  The sauce that they are made in is great for dipping the complimentary rolls into.  It's spicy but not too hot even though we typically enjoy hot and spicy food.  Entrees... Fried Catfish and red beans and rice were the only downfalls. The red beans and rice lacked seasoning. The catfish was not cooked crispy. It was extremely wet and flimsy. I returned it and it came out hot and crispy! Crawfish, shrimp, chicken Diane was amazing and Extremely flavorful!  All in all I will be visiting this restaurant again when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Well.i was highly disappointed, because I heard such good things.  I've spent years in new Orleans,and this place was far from being anything like it, in the food sense.I had the seafood gumbo, and it was like someone dumped the rosemary spice box in it. Terrible.. service was good except, just got the gumbo and the main course showed up 1 minute later. So of course, I refused it. So after 15 minutes under the heat lamp..you get the picture. .the etouffe was bland anyway. Trying cajun yard dog next. . If that's a bust, so much for cajun in charlotte."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots.  HIGHLY recommend the fish specials and the crawfish scampi.  My husband has also enjoyed the blackened ribeye and the pork.  Note, however, that some things are sub-par, namely: the dinner salad, the gumbo and the bread.  While dinner ranks as outstanding in my opinion, these items are surprisingly unsatisfying.  Wine list could be better, too."}
{"text":"Wow - definitely wanted to like this spot, but it was an incredible disappointment.  The popcorn crawfish was way off - over-breaded with a bit of a funky taste (and I generally love crawfish), although the shrimp appetizer was decent.

My friend ordered the Shrimp Scampi despite my objections, and paid the price.  It was completely bland.  Even the steamed broccoli was poorly cooked.  My 4 way Étouffée was a little above average.  We finished with the bread pudding, which was also unexceptional.

To top it off, our service was efficient, but certainly not friendly.  With tip, our bill was $95, and a poor value."}
{"text":"Excellent food, impeccable service as always. One of our favorite places. We took friends for their first time and they raved about it. Said it was rhe best restaurant they'd been to in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"It's Sunday, upstairs and the 7th St Gator band is playing. Sounds and feels like you are in New Orleans. 
Three for brunch and we decided to split all three entrees. Wait, let's get some beignets. Perfect and they have some strawberry dunking sauce that is perfect. 
We order French Toast, Shrimp and Grits and Egg Benedict over crab cakes. The Chef crushed it. Literally, each dish was fantastic. But watch out for the French Toast. Simply the best I have ever had. Fresh Texas Toast made that morning with this bananas foster maple syrup glaze. Each bite made you call for more. You can't go wrong with either of the three dishes but you have to get the French Toast. 
Also, the waiter offered great service and made the experience that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"20 years since last visit. I liked the crawfish appetizer and fried green tomatoes. I should've ordered something other than Étouffée for an entree. I have never had it before. Not for me. 
In the past the more mainstream Cajun dishes have been fantastic. 
My kids are too young to appreciate it so will probably go elsewhere when we are out. Great atomosphere!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the creole with chicken. Great spices snd flavors used in dish. Waiter was very knowledgeable and helped with picking the right entree especially it being first time eating Cajun food.  Ended our meal with the toll house cookie pie...YUM!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible, I got blackened catfish and my fiance got Diane with chicken, shrimp and crawfish and a side of andouille sausage and everything was great. The \"steamed\" broccoli on my plate was more dipped in hot water and still raw but it still tasted great. We also both got desserts, the key lime pie (my all time favorite dessert) and that was incredible and the bourbon pecan pie, which my fiance said was also amazing and was served warm. The reason for 3 stars is the service. Our waiter, Brandon, acted like he couldn't care less that we were there, just kinda threw the food down and walked away, checked on us only once and honestly just didn't even try to offer good service. The bus boy who refilled water, brought bread and took our plates came around more often than he did. However, when a group of older people came in he was so attentive and pointed out everything on the menu to them, went over where the seafood was from and took all the time in the world as he probably assumed they had more money than we did. Needless to say he got the tip that he earned for the service he gave us. I would absolutely go back for the food, just hope I would get a different server."}
{"text":"The good was good. We started with the Wash Day Blues, which was excellent!  The gumbo was a disappointment. I'm not sure if they ran out and had to make another batch real quick. The veggies were on the crunchy side which was surprising. We had the duck breast and the shrink and grits for our entrees. Both were quiet tasty."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Located inside a Victorian house with outside upped deck.  Live music and tasty food!!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating at Cajun Queen. We had heard good things about it. We had a reservation. Upon arrival, we did not feel welcome. We were seated very close to the entrance. It was noisy and dark. The waiter seemed very busy and did not have much time for us. We were unimpressed by the food: there was nothing special. We used to eat at \"Yats\" and \"Gumbo a Go Go\" while living in Indiana and those 2 cajun/creole restaurants were a lot cheaper and the food was a lot better. We felt going to Cajun Queen was a complete waste of our time and money."}
{"text":"Cajun Queen was great.  It is overpriced for cajun food, but the food was great.  I had mahi mahi with some crawfish sauce and vegetables over it.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Cajun Queen. It will not be my last. The service was excellent and the food was superb. I loved the ambiance as I enjoyed my meal by the fireplace. 
The bread pudding was \"The Bomb\". That alone is worht the trip back to the Cajun Queen.

Two thumbs up!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Took my hubby (whose parents and grandparents all grew up in Mississippi, super close to Louisiana) to the Cajun Queen for some cajun food! 

We entered into the foyer (lobby) and were greeted by two cheerful hostesses. They told us it would be about 15 minutes for a table and steered us upstairs to the bar while we waited for our table. We ordered two drinks and were quickly called for our table. We were seated in the small dining room to the right of the foyer. The rooms are all full of dark furniture, paintings, and dark wood. There were many people seated on the downstairs patio, and it looked to have been cooler than the small (packed) dining room. However, the cocktails we ordered when we were seated at our table quickly cooled us off. 

We started our dinner with the fried green tomato appetizer. The tomatoes were artfully displayed with a creamy sauce. The sauce, in combination with the tomatoes, was fabulous! Both dinners came with our choice of gumbo or salad. The waiter highly suggested the gumbo, and it was really good. For entrees we ordered cajun shrimp and grits and crawfish etouffee. Both dinners were full of flavor and were large in size. 

The upstairs dining room, adjacent to the bar, features live jazz music 7 nights a week. Definitely worth a listen while seated at the bar, or eating in that dining room. 

Be sure and pick up some mardi gras beads in the front foyer, and have a sit on the front porch while you let your delicious dinner settle. Grab a photo with the giant queen gator in the front yard as a souvenir!"}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner at Cajun Queen.  Been dining at Cajun Queen for many years and wanted to enjoy Mother's Day meal at this restaurant.  Unfortunately, the food was quite bland.  The fried oysters were cold in the middle.  My favorite New Orleans Platter lacked flavor.  The restaurant was not crowded so they have no excuse for such bad food.  No one at my table had a delicious meal.  
The server was not too good either.
Normally enjoy this place...but not too much on this visit."}
{"text":"This place is different. Its not the best food I've had in the world, nor is it the worst. I had the creole. It wasn't bad, but the only option to give the meal a kick of spice was texas pete or their own special jalapeno sauce. The service didn't exist, as that I ate at the bar. 

The parking is badly setup. The parking lot is small, and forces people to park at other businesses or on the side of the street."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  Food is excellent.  Sometimes it gets a bit loud inside when dining (reason for 4 stars not 5), so we ask for outside patio seating, weather permitting.  Service always good, food always excellent.  I have dined there dozens of times and never had a bad meal.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time going to Cajun Queen and it was Awesome! The atmosphere ambiance was great and the food was Ah-mazzing! I ordered the Diane with chicken, shrimp, and crawfish and it was EVERYTHING! My boyfriend ordered the blackened chicken...his food was really good also. The service was great and our waiter made great recommendations for appetizers and drinks. We will definetly be back."}
{"text":"Tasty Entree..

First visit to the restaurant. I will most definitely be back!! The gumbo was just ok.. lack of seasoning however my entree was excellent. I had blackened chicken with andouille sausage over tortellini in a cream based sauce!!! Yummy"}
{"text":"Fortunate enough to return during Restaurant Week. I elected to order off the special Restaurant Week menu that was a great deal for $30: wine, shrimp gumbo, blackened Mahi Mahi with crawfish & sun dried tomatoes, and key lime pie. The Mahi Mahi was huge and out of this world good. My wife ordered off the menus & went for the dinner salad, 8 oz filet mignon & veggies. Her steak was superb. Live jazz, fun place, excellent service, delicious food."}
{"text":"If you love cajun food, you'll love cajun queen. There is a reason they have been a hot place in Charlotte for a long time...great consistent food. I have been a customer for 17 years."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at the Cajun Queen.  The old house, renovated into a restaurant makes the experience very unique.  The food is fabulous.  I ordered the special salmon with crawfish topping and it seriously is one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had.   The rolls are hot and fresh, and the gumbo is also really tasty helping to build the appetite for the main course.   I didn't get the bread pudding this time I went, but I have had it before and it is very good.   I'm always impressed with the service and the food."}
{"text":"So I wanted so bad to enjoy this experience after reading all of the reviews, but I was not impressed. I guess if I preferred bland food or had never experienced authentic creole food I would have enjoyed myself or maybe not. It all started with a bad hurricane (not the storm, the thing the waitress brought out purporting to be a drink). This would be a one star review, but the fried crawfish was actually pretty tasty. Other than that my main dish was not seasoned well and they should be ashamed of themselves for using baby shrimp in $18.00 dishes. Even the rolls sucked; very dry and tasteless. Maybe I just happened to catch Cajun Queen on a bad day, but I will not be returning to find out if it gets better."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times! The food and service are great! I love the shrimp Diane! Previously parking was a nightmare, but they now offer complimentary valet! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Came here when visiting Charlotte from Philadelphia. Great food, great atmosphere and our server Bo was awesome! The Cajun pasta is amazing and the fried scallops speak for themselves!"}
{"text":"We had 6:00 reservations on a Friday night. We arrived at 5:35 and were happy when our table was already available (holiday weekend so maybe not as crowded as a normal Friday night). We sat in the back which is a sunroom. We loved it and it seemed a little quieter than the rest of the restaurant. 

Bread- good but not spectacular. Side and Caesar salads- also decent but nothing special.  Great beer, wine, and mixed drink selection. They have a small kids menu and there were kids in the restaurant but it was more of an adult place in my mind. I don't think you can overdress because it's a nice (and pretty pricey) restaurant, but you can also come in with a nice pair of jeans. 

For appetizers our group split the BBQ shrimp and fried pickles. The shrimp was wonderful, spicy but bearable:) it was large, juicy, and cooked perfectly (not rubbery). The broth is amazing especially using it as a dip for the rolls. Fried pickles were typical fried pickles with ranch dip. Nothing unique, but still delicious.

Everyone loved their meals with the exception of one person in our party. First, the good. I ordered the special for $25- blackened tilapia over rice with a sauce of crawfish, sundried tomatoes, lemon, and artichoke. HEAVEN! Huge piece of fish (I brought 1/2 my meal home) and it melted in my mouth. The mixture of flavors was on point. 

Now, the bad. One man in our group is obsessed with steak and got the ribeye. The cut of meat was GIANT but it was pretty flavorless. It was cooked correctly but not what any of us would call worth $30. It came with a side of very dry, almost inedible, broccoli. But, it wasn't my meal (I just tried a bite!), so not knocking my review because of it. :)"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service sucks!!! The staff is unfriendly and rude. I had a reservation for a big party and we were treated like unwanted guest. If the staff was on point including the valet parkers who were also rude then I would give it a 4 but honestly we will not be returning back!!!"}
{"text":"Being a Louisiana native who grew up eating authentic cajun/creole dishes, I hesitated to try this. Everyone insisted so I tried it one day. I had the crawfish etoufee and it had very little flavor and it was quite runny. I didn't even finish after about 4 bites. The shrimp and grits were good. The portion sizes are great for the money.  The desert wasn't worth the time. we got it delivered through a 3rd party service and had to warm it up so maybe that was part of the problem. I'd try it again but not the etoufee."}
{"text":"The  Etouffe with the crawfish at the Cajun Queen is the best!  There are very few things I find myself yearning for, but the Crawfish Etouffe at the Cajun Queen s definitely one of them.  The crawfish are so succulent, and chewy, and they give you so many, that you can't help but chew on two or three in each mouthwatering bite.  I think the deliciousness is a combination of the crawfish, and this amazing rich buttery,  sauce they cover the crawfish and rice in.  Really Really good.  I also really like their fried oysters, they were fried perfectly and each oyster was big and meaty, and they gave me a ton of oysters with my order, so I was a very happy man.  Yeah baby Fried oysters and plenty of 'em, that's what I'm talking about.  The restaurant can get a little crowded on weekends, but seven  nights  a week they  do have live jazz upstairs.  The rest of the menu is decent, but if you go to the Cajun Queen make sure to try one of their special dishes,  with the Crawfish, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday.

Made a reservation arrived early and was seated after waiting 30 minutes after the reservation had passed. We came for the Jazz but wound up sitting in a room with no band and canned music.

The food was ok - and if we'd been seated earlier and able to actually hear the music I would give this place a 4 star review."}
{"text":"So authentic! Felt like we were back at Mardi Gras! What a pleasant surprise that they also had New Orleans cocktails too! So glad this Charlotte staple is still thriving!!!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant! 
Valet parking has a long wait sometimes but that won't stop us from coming here!
Our server was super friendly and nice and the place is pretty clean!

The chicken etoufee is so good!
Also, their in house made oreo cheesecake is the BEST cheesecake EVER!
I am drooling just thinking about it!!!

If you haven't already done so, definitely give it a try =)"}
{"text":"Wonderful Cajun cuisine, great live jazz music, and fantastic wine selections. Such a treat for date night!"}
{"text":"We had always loved the food at Cajun Queen, but it had been years since we went there.  It was my husband's birthday and I had a Living Social coupon so we decided it was definitely time again.  It was restaurant week also.  We ended up getting one of the restaurant week specials and it was fantastic.  I usually don't like to go during this time because, in my experience, this week has not given me a good representation of the restaurant.  Not so here....the food was excellent and plentiful, and our waiter, Taylor couldn't have been better!  This dining experience made me realize I shouldn't wait so long to come back here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times and always have a good experience. This time, I ordered Shrimp Etouffee which was very good and not dry. My husband ordered the Fried Shrimp and said it was better than usual. 
In the past we have ordered the Cajan Pasta which is very good and the gumbo which is just okay."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The seafood was cooked to perfection, grits were creamy and tasty and the bread pudding was delightful. We dined on the level with live music and it took me back to my days in NOLA! Artwork displayed celebrated the culture and art of Cajun country. Service was laid back, but embodied the southern charm of the venue. Valet parking available and reservation made via Yelp allowed us immediate seating. I would definitely return upon any future visits to Charlotte."}
{"text":"We went there last night to celebrate hubby's birthday - and they made our experience really beautiful ! 
Fernando C was our server and he was very warm and friendly and always helped with our requests! We have been repeat customers and will continue to be so!"}
{"text":"Before I went to Cajun Queen, I made sure to read a few reviews and noticed that either people loved it or had a mediocre experience. Because I had a Groupon, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. The waiter was attentive and my glass of water was never empty. I got the BBQ shrimp as an appetizer and it was fantastic. Full of flavor! However, my entree was bland! I got the Shrimp Diane and I had such high hopes that fell flat. If it wasn't for the Groupon, I would've been upset to have paid full price. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here. I had the Blackened Pork Tenderloin and it was great. The waiter was attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent crawfish ettouffe and service. An added plus was the jazz trio upstairs. We had the fixed price dinner for Restaurant Week. Perfect dinner."}
{"text":"Food was EVERYTHING!!! If you're looking for good cajun cuisine with tons of flavor, Look no further. This is a must try \"Hidden Gem\"!!!!
The BBQ SHRIMP was Amazing... be sure to get extra bread to sop up that broth. The service was great and nice cozy atmosphere. Did mention I'm in love with this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Charlotte and only here for a few hours omw back to NY. Recv'd a list of restaurants and we chose Cajum Queen. The food here is some of the best New Orleans based Cajun I've had outside of New Orleans itself! Absolutely worth every penny! The staff  were very nice and attentative without being annoying. Definitely want to return to Charlotte just for this place!"}
{"text":"Great location and ambiance !! My food could have been hotter and my drink could have been
Stronger but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to dining at the Cajun Queen from hearing about their authentic New Orleans cuisine to seeing their Best Cajun Restaurant in Charlotte status. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't memorable. I wish I could write about the service or the exact taste of the food but it was simply meh. I got the Blackened Catfish Filet with mashed taters (which I do remember and were fabulous) but I think they forgot the blackening on it or don't know what blackening means. I had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick.

It's a charming place however they had some live music which I personally found loud (and this moment right here is when I turned old).If you're looking for authentic New Orleans style food like I was, I would pass."}
{"text":"Out of town business group tried it out. The Creole was good but the Mahi mahi special was delicious with large serving.  The New Orleans beers were a nice touch.  The key lime pie was very good.  Neat atmosphere in old house.  Seating on the roof was great way to enjoy a beautiful day."}
{"text":"First time here, The Diane was amazing, big enough to share and very tasty!!! We got all the meats added! Superb!"}
{"text":"I came to Cajun Queen with my team from work on Tuesday, May 22nd, 2018.  There were five of us... several of whom had never been to Cajun Queen before.

I made the reservation and was first to arrive.  The prompt and readily available complimentary valet parking is invaluable to guests in an area where parking can sometimes be a nightmare, so that's awesome!  I was seated immediately and asked if I'd like a beverage upon being seated.  The service really was snappy, well executed, and given with a big smile!

We ordered fried oysters and fried green tomatoes as apps which everyone loved, and then our meals themselves were just lovely... a perfect touch of cajun spice!  

I wish I could write more, but all I can say is that if you like Cajun Food and a live band, you can do worse than to try out this Charlotte staple.  I've come here to eat several times (often with large groups) and the service and food are always a delight!"}
{"text":"What to say about the Cajun Queen..Hmm??? OK I got it..Its not a bad place at all, but I wasn't to impressed with the gumbo, to me it seemed like something was missing. I decide to have the Diane Chicken and it was simply amazing, it seemed to just melt it my mouth and what can i say about the fired green tomatoes( hold one second while i wipe the droll of of my mouth) lol .....The staff is great and the jazz band was awesome and played a over all large selection of music...so over all i would put them on my top ten"}
{"text":"Ok, so the 1st time was incredible! Amazing & authentic! My first thought at least. My 2nd time, they worse than mediocre. 

·Bread & butter- ok, the meal had been the best part.

Appetizer:
·Fried Green Tomatoes- Incredible!! So delicious! These are still my favorite here! 

My meal:
·Tortellini & cream sauce plain & comes with a salad that has carrots, cabbage, romaine, cucumber w/ ranch dressing.
··1st time - Everything was so yummy! 
··2nd time - The salad was the best part! They over cooked the pasta where it was mushy. 

·French Fries- delicious!

·Grits- watery and clumpy. Terrible! 

·Garlic Mashed Potatoes- Dry and had a disgusting smoked or meat flavor to it.

My friend's order:
·Diane- her absolute favorite. Lick the bowl clean type of good!

·Shrimp etoufee- not good! Not the right seasoning, just like hot sauce was dumped into it."}
{"text":"The food was bland. It's hard to obtain good cajun food outside of New Orleans. I had to add old bay to my Gumbo and shrimp creole. Bread pudding was good."}
{"text":"I love, love, love it here! Wonderful flavors in a cozy home like setting.  The etouffee was delish mix of shrimp, chicken, and crawfish in an amazing spicy sauce.  I will definitely be come back here"}
{"text":"Cajun Queen serves up consistent cajun food in a fun environment.  It's not exactly what you would find dining out in NOLA, and it's a bit pricey for what you get, but if you have a craving, it will fix that.

The one thing that makes Cajun Queen stand out is the rooftop dining.  It's a great place on a nice night.  There is also live jazz in the upstairs dining section.  

Word of warning - if you order a cocktail, you only need one.  ;)"}
{"text":"We had BBQ shrimp as an appetizer and blackened catfish which was also excellent. Excellent quality food for the price.  Restaurant is on and old house, lots of character and very charming. Upstairs room with jazz band can be very loud, if you are looking for conversation, you will want to be downstairs."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a very nice dinner upstairs in the jazz room. The musicians are great and really add to the neighborhood ambiance of the space. The food was delicious and our server was so thoughtful and attentive."}
{"text":"Once upon a time in a city FAR FAR AWAY (from HOME = Chicago) a Beautiful young woman and her handsome husband were toying around on Groupon while house hunting  (The Queen City = Charlotte) and low and behold a deal for this place by the name of Cajun Queen.

Considering that we met in New Orleans, LA and my great grandmother is from the French Quarters and cooked Cajun food regularly, we have a distinctive taste bud for AMAZING to Moderate Authentic Cajun Food.

When you approach you would not expect the crowd that this place draws, I ALWAYS make a reservation on Open Table before going ALWAYS. It's a HUGE house that was transitioned into a restaurant and a HUGE house it is in order to fit that many people at tables inside for brunch, lunch and dinner. It's not that large but considering that it was a HOME it's HUGE.

The day we decided on land to build our home on we decided to go celebrate and have dinner using our Groupon. 
THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST GROUPON DEALS WE EVER OBTAINED mainly due to the Southern feel, the TASTE, the SERVICE, etc...

I am not a FIVE star type of woman by far, I have to be pretty impressed and Cajun Queen has been VERY consistent. We've been more than 20 times now and I am just writing my review because I had to wait to ensure that there was consistency with the service, taste and feel of this place.

Cajun Queen is our GO-TO restaurant when we have family or friends visit. We like to take them somewhere that they can't go when they are back in their perspective cities that is also AMAZING and leave a memory in their mouth and mind. 

We've had everything from craw-fish appetizer, fried green tomatoes, Fried Oysters, etc.. to Entrees including the Blacken Salmon topped with craw-fish and artichoke & sun dried tomato, Shrimp & Craw-fish Diane, Chicken Diane, Gumbo, Seafood Etouffee', New Orleans Platter (Fried Everything) etc..

All items mentioned are AWESOME, there are ALWAYS deals on Groupon however we go with or without a Groupon because it's WELL WORTH IT.. Be sure to make a reservation and if you don't be prepared to wait, however the bar area is small upstairs but a good time to say the least.

Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Parking sucks. Food is high for no reason. Downstairs tables are too close. Not a fan."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. It boasts a Louisiana  style menu. However this dish ( cajun platter) lacked any type of cajun spices. You can't serve red beans and rice with no gravy  and consider that to be a  Louisiana style dish. My husband ordered the New York strip and had to put salt on it because there was no flavor. I certainly have had better and I would not visit again. Overrated!"}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this place.  Seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard.  Once inside it's actually a really nice place.  The service is great, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time.  There is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time.  Looking at the other reviews, I think the food is kind of hit or miss.  I guess I was lucky with the red beans and rice, it was really good by my standards at least."}
{"text":"Very nicely seasoned Cajun chicken pasta but hard to taste the sausage. The cheese pasta was good. Barbecue shrimp was a bit more spicy than I have had several times in NOLA but good. Sazerac was fabulous and the best bread pudding. Just enough sauce and the edges crispy and sweet. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. 

Appetizer - BBQ shrimp just ok. 
Seafood gumbo - just ok. 
I just think there tomato based broths need a little more seasoning. 
  
Entree- Shrimp Diane very good full of  flavor.

Free valet, live jazz, nice ambiance"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. With the perfect mix of fresh, delicious cajun food and eclectic decor in an old, historic house turned restaurant, you really can't go wrong. The parking can be a pain on weekend evenings and the quarters can be quite tight, for these reasons I typically visit Cajun Queen on weekday nights. The fried oysters are my favorite - and I typically don't do fried!"}
{"text":"BBQ shrimp...
Fried oysters...
RBR...

All brilliant."}
{"text":"Good food and some things are the menu are so much better than the others. The gumbo was not as good as I expected but the BBQ shrimp, shrimp and grits and fried green tomatoes were awesome. Do yourself a favor and buy the group on $25 for $40 worth of food. Nice little Cajun gem in the QC."}
{"text":"Had a groupon, so wasn't sure how this was going to go. Walked in on Sunday night and got pleasantly surprised with a live jazz band. The tables upstairs are very close together, but add to the close feel of the place! We ordered the gumbo to start, nice big shrimp and okra in it! Dip the bread in it, add a little hot sauce and you are set!  We split the blackened Mahi and chicken, wow! Fantastic blackened flavors, yet not charred! Flavors exploded in your mouth! Red beans and rice on the side were good also! Had to over indulge and order the pecan pie also. Came warm, way too sweet but delicious crust! Overall a fantastic date dinner!"}
{"text":"We've been in Charlotte for about 6 months, transplanted from Long Island, and quite frankly, we're sick of chain food! We wanted something different, and that's exactly what we got at Cajun Queen.

We were seated quickly, and offered the choice between inside, inside upstairs where the live jazz was playing, or outside. (We went with outside, why not?)

Our waiter was attentive without being over bearing, and our drinks refilled without having to ask. He explained not only the specials but the \"house favorites\" as well.  We both chose something off the regular menu, wanting to see standards rather than one offs for our 1st visit, and we were not disappointed at all! We both enjoyed food that had flavor, and character, and didn't taste like everything else. I suppose coming from NY, we we're a bit spoiled by the variety and quantity of food choices, and it was nice to see with a little bit of poking around, it can still be found in our new home.

The food and the service were wonderful, and the prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we received. This is definitely a place we will return to, and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food was good all of us got the same dish The cajun chicken pasta. The waitstaff was on point with service and refills. Only 1 downside was the parking."}
{"text":"Visited today for Sunday brunch(party of 2)....Had a reservation, seated right away, were given our choice of seating area..We chose the back room(?) with all the fleur-de-lis pictures on the wall..There was a slight \"odor\" in the air, most likely from the mop water but soon forgot about it once the food came..Our server was Erin(correct spelling?) and he  was very good in explaining the Brunch menu,  etc..We didn't order adult beverages so I can't comment on the bar..We decided to go with the large order of the fried oysters and the barbecue shrimp and a bowl of of seafood gumbo... not  bad but nothing special...would not order in the future...But the fried oysters, WOW!! can definitely say they are some of if not the best we ever had!! Huge, perfect amount of breading, juicy and so tasty!! The barbecue shrimp were just about as good, sopped up every drop of broth with the complimentary bread(warm rolls) provided..And for dessert if you may,  Beignets  !! They looked great, and tasted just as great , still hot from the fryer with a perfect dusting of powered sugar and a strawberry compote(jam?) dipping sauce..Delicious!!  On the way out, we both used the restrooms(madame and monsieur) and both very clean ..And a big bonus, dined with a groupon..I definitely recommend the Cajun Queen and will be back, hopefully for dinner to catch the live jazz band playing there nightly.."}
{"text":"Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! 

The Service is always good and friendly!"}
{"text":"A little overpriced but the food is really great! And the restaurant has a fun New Orleans feel to it. Great date place!"}
{"text":"The vibe was just what I was looking for. Laid back but not too quiet or isolated. It said it was jazz night but maybe they left, we arrived at 9:30 & it close at 10:30. We had the BBQ Shrimp & Bayou Platter. I don't mind spicy but when I was half way through, I wasn't sure I could finish it bc my taste buds were disappearing. Spicy! The Bayou Platter was very spicy. However the waiter said we could've asked for mild spice. Overall, awesome vibe & if you can handle spicy food this is your place. 3 stars bc of the heat...no dig at the restaurant. Just a preference thing."}
{"text":"Food was bangin. I got the sirloin special with mashed potatoes and etoufee with just the right amount of kick. 

We requested to sit upstairs thinking we would have a nice date with some soft jazz in the background. Oh man was I wrong. The music, in combination with a table of like 20 people, made it almost impossible to commuicate. We literally texted a couple times, it was bad. Overall it was nice and I would go back, perhaps on a weeknight, and will most definitely be sitting downstairs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit. I love the atmosphere and the waiting staff is very friendly. I ordered crawfish etouffee and it was delicious. The only change that I think they should make is to have corn bread or garlic bread instead of the rolls."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Cajun Queen though it's been a staple in Charlotte for years. 

Cajun Queen is set in a cozy home located off of 7th St. While this gives great appeal, it makes for a very challenging parking situation. They offer complimentary valet. I also recommend making a reservation, as the space is small and often packed.

The shrimp étouffée was very good. Slightly under-salted but great flavor with the right amount of heat.

The service was friendly, fast and attentive. All 3 of the attributes that I seek at a quaint spot like Cajun Queen."}
{"text":"I absolutely love William Julius Kellam The Third!!!!! But the sloppy manager is a different story. The Swamp Water is always good, as well as, my medium ribeye!!!! #noneedforchange!#leftovermediumribeye&eggd"}
{"text":"I'd had this place bookmarked to try for a lonnnng time! So when my friends suggested it for Restaurant Week I was obviously elated. Finally!!! 

And they did not let me down!!! It met all of my expectations and more. 

I like that their menu for Restaurant Week includes all of their classic dishes and a glass of wine! 

I decided to go with the seafood gumbo, étouffée with all three (chicken, shrimp and crawfish) and the key lime our for dessert. 

The seafood gumbo was classic. It was warm and hearty with just the right amount of spices. The étouffée was nothing short of amazing!!! I'm basically a fan of this dish for two reasons....one they are not skimpy with any of the meat selections and two it's sooo spicy! I definitely recommend sopping....(yes sopping) up some of that delicious sauce with those rolls. Yum. 

Not to be outdone the key lime pie was a great way to end the meal. 

Add to an amazing meal a live band and complimentary valet....this place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was expecting so much better from Cajun Queen. Compared to the cooking in New Orleans every dish we had at Cajun Queen was a disappointment. We had BBQ shrimp, talapia with crawfish and etouffee. It felt that every dish had been rushed to be put together. Not enough time had been given to let the spices and flavors blend and develop. I recommend the owners concentrate more on quality rather than turning over the tables as fast as possible."}
{"text":"Absolute best service EVER.  The food was divine.  Atmosphere was cozy and romantic.  Good for families as well."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, average food, and limited parking.  I had the gumbo and shrimp and grits. My boyfriend had the blackened chicken.  
I really felt that the food needed some salt, and there was none on the table. Honestly I can make better shrimp and grits than they were serving. His chicken was very juicy.
The atmosphere is very cozy. We went on a Sunday evening not too late. It seemed to not be packed at that time. I regret not trying the bourbon pecan pie.  Thankfully we had a Groupon for half the price!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, fantastic food, and great service. I was in Charlotte and visited Cajun Queen for dinner. There was a small wait so our party headed up to the bar and decided to eat in the bar area. While the bar was busy the bartender was very attentive and delivered great service for both our food and bar orders. This being our first visit the bartender gave some recommendations that were fantastic. The bbq shrimp and fried green tomatoes appetizers were top notch. I had the Duck special that was wonderful and full of great flavor. The bourbon bread pudding was another great choice to finish out the meal. If you are looking for great cajun food in Charlotte this is the place."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been too in Charlotte. I ordered the New Orleans fish platter and it was out of this world. The gumbo is so flavorful too! You get what you pay for here! Awesome jazz music too! I will defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite cajun restaurant in the Charlotte area. Actually, this might be my favorite period. The staff and service is top notch. The food is excellent. The key lime pie.... oh my (I understand this is actually prepared by a 3rd party so credit to them and CQ for carrying it). Always a great night out and a nice date spot for the wife and I."}
{"text":"The Cajun Queen was excellent and the service was fantastic and the food was incredible I highly recommend this place. I had shrimp Creole and my friend had the blackened catfish both were phenomenal."}
{"text":"This is (I mean WAS) my first time at this establishment. I purchased a Groupon that was expiring so decided to utilize it. I made reservations for myself, mom & son. Once we were seated, the server proceeded to tell us about the restaurant week menu. I advised that I had a Groupon and was not interested in the special. Well low & behold, I could not use my Groupon. I told the server the Groupon was expiring, thus the reason why we were there. Not my issue that it was during restaurant week. He asked me if I wanted him to speak to the manager about it & I stated \"yes\". He returns & informs me that the manager stated that I could use my Groupon. Great news or at least until the check arrived. Once I received the check, the amount of the Groupon ($45) is not deducted rather only $25. I inquire about this to now be told that only the amount I paid could be deducted or the manager would allow the Groupon to be extended a month...all of this after we have eaten. We drove an hour to this place trying to use the Groupon before it expired. If I was only going to receive the paid amount of the Groupon, there was not any need for us to drive this hour on a Friday afternoon in rush hour traffic. I am not sure what restaurant week is but we did not partake of the special menu being offered. In addition I would not visit a restaurant that is a permanent Groupon fixture during \"restaurant week\". I believe the point of restaurant week is to try out restaurants you may not normally visit due to cost but Cajun Queen is a Groupon regular that can be visited for an expensive amount anytime of the year. I patronize businesses that actually warrant my business. Unfortunately this will not be one of them."}
{"text":"I honestly love the Cajun Queen! From the cozy atmosphere inside (which offers the same fun and authentic feeling of any fine restaurant located on Bourbon Street), to the jazz band playing upstairs, all the way down to the blackened items listed on their menu, this place has made my trip worthwhile every time.  You can usually find a \"Groupon\" online before heading out which will make your visit a little lighter on the wallet -  or in my case allow for a few more drinks from their New Orleans style drink selections. That's just my two cents! i hope this review helps and I encourage you to give this big two story house with the large green gator out front a try if Cajun cooking sounds good to you."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that the food and the service here is amazing. Unfortunately we had a pretty bad experience with the valet parking and the restaurant manager.

Towards the end of our meal, I noticed one of the valet guys move my car out of the parking lot right next to the restaurant, and around 5 or so minutes later, return it back to the same spot in the same parking lot. After asking the valet why that would happen, I was told it was to move another car out of the way. When asked why the car would be driven around the block just to move it out of the way, he didn't have a good answer, especially when my car (a sports car), was the only one that was \"strategically\" moved.

After bringing my concerns to the restaurant manager, I was essentially told that he would have to trust that they had a good reason for moving my car. Needless to say, his answer and lack of action was very disappointing. I would expect the manager to take such matters much more seriously and at the least investigate the issue...

So if you're thinking of going here, enjoy the food but be careful with letting the valet park your car."}
{"text":"Needless to say.. I like it hot and I feel like Cajun Queen GETS me. There is definitely enough spice to be had here for all! My bf and I went this past weekend and I always can't believe that I don't come here more often. 

We started off with the BBQ Shrimp, which had decent-sized shrimpies swimming around in cajun tastiness and it was just enough to leave us wanting more. I had the 4-way etouffee, yes, 4-WAY ettouffee with chicken, shrimp, crawfish and sausage and it was just what the doctor ordered for my spice addiction! My man ordered the shrimp and grits and loved his so much that he ate it again at home the next night! The etouffee was obviously meaty and spicy, while the shrimp and grits were creamy and plentiful. I, of course, enjoyed my meal with a Dixie's Blackened Voodoo (spiced) lager. Spice, spice, spice!

Bonus while dining at Cajun Queen: LIVE jazz music every night of the week! If you sit  upstairs, you will have the pleasure of  eating and drinking to fun music that totally fits the Cajun cuisine. The band may be a little too loud at times to have a normal dinner conversation but this is what makes the experience fun! If you would rather a more quiet dinner, make a reservation for the downstairs area of the restaurant or for a table outside. 

Just a heads up: You may have to wait a few minutes before your table is ready for your reservation...  All the more reason to belly up to the bar while you wait. Duh. 
The service may be a bit slow as they are always busy and the servers sometimes get a tad overwhelmed. But most aren't in a hurry while enjoying what the Queen has to offer so it's never seemed to be much of a problem for me."}
{"text":"Unique restaurant located in a 2 story house. Food is really good. You can also visit the bar upstairs where you can to listen to live music. great place"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The Jazz was fantastic!
Only drawback was that although we had reservations, it took about 40 minutes to get seated. We had to wait at the bar. The price for the amount of food was a little much, but it was excellent!!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to New Orleans many times and have experienced some great Cajun style food, so I have pretty high standards.  For the most part, from what I've ordered, CQ does a decent job.  I've been twice and ordered the Étouffée both times because it's very good.  It's got the perfect amount of spice that pairs well with an ice cold Abita.  The BBQ shrimp is a great app as well.  It's not so much about the shrimp as it is the sauce you dip the bread in.  Delicious.  My girlfriend was hit and miss with her entrees in the 2 times we've been.  The shrimp Diane was just OK.  It's a lighter consistency than the Étouffée and doesn't have the kick I look for when I'm in the mood for Cajun.  The shrimp and grits weren't good at all.  The grits were bland and the blackened shrimp didn't hit the mark.

Overall, I enjoy coming here, but the prices are a little high in my opinion.  They have a Groupon & Living Social pretty much all the time, so don't forget to grab one before you go!"}
{"text":"VERY rarely do my boyfriend and I leave dinner completely satisfied, elated and already planning our next trip. Well, Cajun Queen happened to be one of those meals.

Neither of us eat cajun/creole very often so we were a little hesitant at first. After holding on to a Groupon for a few weeks we finally made the trip...what on earth took us so long?!

One step through the doors and you're immediately transported to a raucous, lively setting reminiscent of 1980's New Orleans. Tables are tightly packed; patrons share drinks and laughs; and sounds of jazz echo from upstairs. The walls are adorned by \"Nawlins\" inspired artwork and an appropriate purple, gold and green palette is interwoven throughout the house.

The Gumbo was the only thing that I wasn't completely impressed with. It had good flavor and an ample helping of shrimp but I felt it was missing something. The consistency was thinner and more watered down than I anticipated. Keep in mind I am no cajun aficionado.

The boyfriend ordered the pasta special: Two blackened chicken breasts over a heaping portion of tortellini in a spicy pesto cream sauce with peppers, Andouille sausage, peppers, and artichokes. WOWEE MAMA. This was one of the most delicious meals (yes, it wasn't even my meal) that I've had in a while.

My étouffée was delicious as well, thought admittedly, not quite as impressive as the pasta dish. It did kick some heat but it was good flavorful spice heat. Large portions seemed to be the theme of night and despite force-feeding ourselves to the point of pain, we both managed to leave with decent-sized leftovers.

From the camaraderie and excellent service to the food and drinks...everything seemed to be perfect and I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Cajun Queen for the first time last week for our anniversary dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our appetizer (Cajun Popcorn) and entrees (Fried Catfish with broccoli and mashed potatoes). The service was good, but not great. The wine was delicious. They have live music in the upstairs room every night. The music was nice and not too loud. We will go back"}
{"text":"Food good, manager was very much lacking in people skills and customer service. Will not be back. Too many places in CLT where you can get both"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Cajun Queen last Friday night . We had 7:30 dinner reservations. We pulled up and they had a valet service - nice touch! Parking can be very difficult over there. We were seated immediately at a very nice table next to a window. I ordered the Diane and my boyfriend got the Etouffe. Both were very good! My only complaint was, we felt incredibly rushed. We planned on having a nice, relaxing dinner. From the time we walked in the door to the moment our food came out, it was 14 minutes. A little too quick for me. I felt like our waiter kept trying to rush us out the door. We were finished with dinner (drinks, entree and dessert) in less than an hour. For the amount of money we spent, I am disappointed in their service, or at least the service of our particular waiter."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Cajun Queen. Services were much better than last time, but I got a dirty fork. Four stars for food, not for the rest."}
{"text":"Great place! I've never been to New Orleans, but my dad has and he is a huge fan of Cajun food, so I thought it would be nice to take him to brunch there. We were all really impressed. My mom and I had the Creole shrimp and grits and my dad had biscuits and gravy. We also got an order of beignets. The beignets are a definite must! 
The Cajun Queen is a great brunch place, we will definitely be back for dinner some time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I REALLY wanted to like this place. I have heard countless rave reviews. Of course, I wasn't expecting it to compare to my food experiences in Louisiana but I was expecting something. My mother and I ventured here on Saturday for dinner and we were both really disappointed. 

Fried green tomatoes- 2/5 The breading was really bland and they were topped with a gallon of sauce. They were very unappetizing. I prefer the ones I make at home.

Fried oysters app- really good and the only thing I enjoyed. I would highly recommend. 

Salads- Truly out of the bag salad mix. They could have added some tomato or something to liven it up. The blue cheese dressing was good though.

Crawfish etoufee- It was very average with way too much rice.

Service, however, was phenomenal. We simply didn't enjoy most of our food. I really wouldn't even go back to try it again."}
{"text":"Great place! Had a reservation for 6:30 and was seated at 6:30.  Location is an old house, very cute.  Had the fried oysters and fried crawfish tails as appetizers and both were delicious. The peach martini was great as well.  My husband had the blackened chicken and catfish along with the gumbo and he loved all of it.  I had the shrimp creole and it was tasty and filled me up so I had to take the rest to go.  I would recommend this restaurant for an awesome date night!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. I have eaten here in the past and it was much better. I had the blackened catfish and fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes were a bit hard but the catfish was great. My husband had the gumbo and etoufee 3 ways. Neither of them had good flavor or seasoning. Not sure if I would give this one another try or not. We may just have to make a trip to NOLA instead."}
{"text":"Had a tasty dinner here this evening. Average ambience, food came out quickly. It was tasty but not out of this world. Parking was a little annoying, required use of the valet (though it was \"free\"). Will be back.
Edit: we came back again. This visit was not as well. Service was sorely lacking. Food was decent. 

** dont waste your money coming here without a groupon. it's totally not worth it at full price!**"}
{"text":"Cajun Queen was a great choice. Great atmosphere, live jazz. I had Salmon topped with shrimp, great portions. I left stuffed. Bread pudding was amazing, I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Even without a Groupon I would visit Cajun Queen! The food is a taste of New Orleans, right here in the Queen City. The ambiance of this restaurant reminds me of the charm of the French Quarter.  A live jazz band plays during the week and adds that perfect touch to a wonderful dining experience. I always say I'm going to try something different, but I usually order \"Three Way Diane\": chicken breast, shrimp and crawfish sauteed with mushrooms, garlic, green, onions, and parsley served over a bed of rice. This dish has a hint of spice to complement the dish. The portion is perfect and depending on my mood, I have some to bring home or I eat every morsel.  Other visits to CQ, I've ordered the BBQ shrimp, shrimp etouffee and the fish of the day. I've just never written a review. The gumbo is good, but on my last visit I felt that it was missing something...just couldn't put my taste buds on it."}
{"text":"So thankful we made reservations here, folks were waiting at least 35 plus on a Saturday. :) Hostesses were nice. We really appreciated the staff being trained properly. Our server was personable, knowledgeable of the menu&gave good recommendations. He also did not hover. Cool and he got an A from us. We really enjoyed our drinks (get Planters Punch), salads, Shrimp etoufee' and Chicken Diane. We were unimpressed with BBQ shrimp's flavor. The broth was wonderful for dipping the ( cold) bread, yet the shrimp had no flavor. Maybe they can marinate the shrimp with the broth instead of just dropping them in?Also, the bread pudding was just okay. We figured the bourbon&peaches would pack a punch. The seating is tight like others point out, but manageable. Prices match well with portion sizes aka we did not feel cheated. We will definitely  come back for food&drinks only. We will then pickup some Mama R's bread pudding for dessert."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service, nice atmosphere. Free valet is a big plus in that neighborhood too.  I like the food at Boudreaux's a litlte better because I love their jambalaya, but Cajun Queen is very good too and a little nicer inside. A little more pricey too but on par for that part of town."}
{"text":"The wife has wanted to try this place for some time now, so when a living social came out, I figured that I would buy one.  Cajun Queen, like many restaurants, has fallen into the category of \"why did it take me so long to try\".

Our meal was a solid 4 star experience, and it started with great service. Both my bowl of seafood gumbo and crawfish etoufee were full of cajun flavor and spicy, just like I was looking for. The wife got some shrimp as an app and they came with another great spicy sauce.  For her main, it was her standard blackened catfish, which she thoroughly enjoyed, but took half of it home due to the hugeness of the portion. Not being a fan of catfish, I didn't taste it, but rather focused on finishing every last bit of my etoufee.

Cajun Queen is definitely a little taste of New Orleans in Charlotte, and we shall return again soon."}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is so good! Basically everything they have on the menu is filled with flavor!! The atmosphere is relaxing and the food is definitely well worth the price for good Cajun food. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Cajun Queen wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. If you've been to New Orleans and sampled the fare, then you will be disappointed with the cuisine. While not on par with New Orleans, it's not without charm. Still, not the Big Easy. 

For scale: 1- ingesting Old Bay seasoning, 
2 - a box of Zatarain's, 4 - Cajun Queen, 
10 - New Orleans.

The service was great, but we could tell our waitress was overworked even with the servers assistants refilling waters and removing finished plates. 

Everything arrived lukewarm; gumbo, the \"all 3\" (crawfish, shrimp, and chicken) étouffée, and even the broccoli side. And although the étouffée cautioned, \"Spicy!,\" it was tame. 

One winning aspect was the Sazerac cocktail, and New Orleans beer on the menu (Abita). 

We'd go again for drinks."}
{"text":"Me: \"Where do I PARK?! The salon next door is closed, can I park there?\"
Hostess: \"No, you'll still get towed even though they're closed.\"
Me: \"Hmm, I guess I'll park somewhere in the streets\" (circles neighborhood 3 times)
Me: \"Where else can I park?
Hostess: \"We have valet\"

I'm not a fan. Let be backtrack a bit. I used to LOVE Cajun Queen. 5 stars without a doubt. Over the years, the quality of the food and service has significantly decreased while the prices have risen. I've gone back maybe 3 or 4 times in hopes that each time was just a bad day.. no luck. I think I'll stick to Cajun Yard Dog for my Cajun needs."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe that I haven't written a review of the Cajun Queen before!  I guess because it is such a \"Charlotte Institution\" that I just imagined I would have written about it before!  Anyhow, this is one of my fav places to go when we actually leave the \"Ballantyne Bubble\".  

We recently purchased a Groupon and went to meet some friends there for dinner.  While I love saving the $$ associated with groupon-type specials, I really dread going to the restaurant when I know that they are going to be swamped with other customers who are also taking advantage of the savings.  It seems that most restaurants do not properly prepare for the increase in business that will result from offering the coupons.  Many times, we have noticed that there is not enough staff to handle the increased number of customers -- so the level of service and also the quality of the food suffers. But enough of that tangent...back to the Cajun Queen...

Since there were going to be 6 of us, we made a reservation.  David and I arrived before the rest of our party, so we went upstairs to the bar while we waited. The bar was pretty full and I must say, the service in the bar area suffered because of it. It took a while to get our beers and the bartender didn't bother offering an orange or a glass for my Blue Moon, which was disappointing. But I had my \"big girl panties\" on , so I got over it and just decided to try and enjoy the beer straight from the bottle sans l'orange.  

Almost immediately after getting our beers, the hostess announced over the loudspeaker that our party of 6 was being seated.  Yay, CQ for having our table ready on time!  And yay friends for not being late! :0

After being seated in a nice big corner table, we decided to order 3 appetizers for the table to share and went with the bar-b-cue shrimp, some sort of fried crawfish thing, and fried pickles. The bbq shrimp was definitely my fav of the 3.  I personally can live without fried pickles, but the other folks in our party seemed to really like them.  I am not normally a huge fan of crawfish, but this dish was really tasty.   Sadly, there were no oysters available for appetizers (although the waiter said they had a few in reserve for one of the entrees).  

For my entree, I went with the shrimp etouffee - one of my favorite dishes.  It was spot on!  David had the shrimp creole and I tasted a bite of it - it was very good as well but not as spicy as mine. (I like spicy!)   We ordered some desserts to share among the table and for some reason, ended up with 2 pieces of key lime pie and 1 of the tollhouse cookie something-or-another.  They were both good, but I wish someone at the table had ordered a bread pudding because theirs is delish! 

This would have been a 5 star review, except for the fact that there were several issues with the service thorughout our meal.  Nothing egregious, but a series of little things (mostly a lack of attention to detail) that detracted from making this a 5 star experience.  

But, all-in-all, we had a great time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  So, with another Groupon waiting to be put to good use, we will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"This was a treat.  Loved their food and service.  The bbq shrimp was memorable.  Everyone loved our experience here."}
{"text":"We didn't try the food because we just wanted some wine, but it all smelled amazing and when we arrived at 4:30 we were asked if we had a reservation so I'm thinking they're usually pretty booked up! 

Service was good in the bar...definitely enjoyed our wine and the atmosphere. Great way to get that Southern feel! At 6pm their live jazz started up. I was hoping for some more lively music, but it was more easy listening which was understandable given the size of the restaurant and the close proximity of the band to diners."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The atmosphere is like a southern home in Louisiana.  The food was delicious; however, I give it four stars because our waiter wasn't the best.  I went with 2 of my friends (we're all under 30) and they didn't serve us the way he served the people beside us.

We first ordered the gumbo, which wasn't bad.  It wasn't as tasteful that I thought it would be.  However, using our bread with the gumbo, made it so much better.  The bread soaked up the gumbo and gave it a little bit of a buttery taste.

As for my entree, I ordered the etouffee four ways.  On the menu, it list three ways, but u can get four ways (which includes andouille sausage).  My friend ordered the shrimp etouffee. 

As close friends do, we tasted the other and we both found mine to be better because the andouille sausage gave it a little bit of a sweeter taste that mixes well with the spices.

I'd recommend this place!

FYI:  There's sometimes groupons that make it a cheap place to eat! Keep a look out!"}
{"text":"Best Cajun place in town. The food is amazing. Right mix of heat and flavor. You will leave full but wanting more. The BBQ Shrimp is food for the soul. 
I highly recommend the Cajun Queen evenif your just passing through
#cajunqueen"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal! The reason I gave them 4 stars is because our waiter needed reminded several times to bring out lemons for water. In addition, the gumbo tasted like a tomato soup with shrimp and okra added. I was not impressed with that at all! 
We started with crawfish scampi and it was super good. It has a little spice just so youM know but delicious with the bread...M y boyfriend had the pan seared duck (medium). It was cooked perfectly and the Flavors were tremendous. I had the Cajun chicken pasta and it was by far the best if ever had. Even great the next day which is hard to accomplish! I would definitely go back but do not recommend the gumbo unless you like it with a strong tomato soup flavor. I expected way more flavor after trying their various sauces but still a great experience!
PS: When a woman asks for lemons more than 3 x you're in trouble (haha)."}
{"text":"Overall I love Cajun Queen it's usually the first place I think of to bring guests from out of town and for special events like birthdays.  The atmosphere keeps bringing me back I love sitting in this cozy house listening to the band and sipping on my dirty martini and the Mardi Gras beads just put me in a good mood.

I have had great experiences with the food and a couple just ok experiences - but I think now I know exactly what to order you can not go wrong with the appetizers the oysters are some of the best I've had and I love the crawfish scampi.  The BBQ shrimp are beyond tasty but I normally order that as my meal now it comes as an entree too. A couple of things on the menu I don't care for are the shrimp and grits if your thinking you'll be getting some southern shrimp and grits I will steer you away from this entree you will be disappointed. The gumbo was also a big disappointment to me where is the heat.

The fish specials are usually pretty good but can be bland. Stick to the dishes they are known for, etouffee, diane, creole, you'll be happy,"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for while and happy that I finally decided to come. Very nice ambiance, we sat on the second floor where there was live jazz. We both ordered something different and loved each others meal. Our waiter was very attentive and our meals came out quick and hot. Ummm...almost forgot about the amazing Mandarin Martini I had."}
{"text":"We stopped by for Easter brunch however we were 15 min too late. I had the Diane shrimp which was tasty and spicy. They get a 3 from me because the portions were small and the sweet tea tastes awful!  May give this place another try based in its cool location and my friend said their fried food taste better."}
{"text":"Seated promptly at 5:30 right by the fireplace.  Staff friendly and helpful. Ordered fried green tomatoes. Good and the sauce on top tasty still like the ones from Tupelo Honey better. Next time will definitely try the bbq shrimp. I ordered the shrimp creole and salad my husband had the Cajun pasta and cup of gumbo.  Everything was great especially the Cajun pasta.  Next time I would skip the salad if ordering an appetizer because portions are very generous and the shrimp creole was full of shrimp. Only negative is parking. Which is pretty much non existent so make your reservations early."}
{"text":"So first have to disclose that I lived in New Orleans and worked in top rated restaurants.....so might be little biased.

Service was good....no issues.

Downstairs dining room.....no issues, but not memorable.

Food....well, NOT good Cajun/creole food.  Had the traditional NOLA foods.....Gumbo, Shrimp Etoufee, Red Beans/Andouille.  Gumbo was tomato based.....which if ever been to authentic restaurant in LA, never!  Shrimp in Gumbo were smallest over cooked I have ever had.  Etoufee flavor was good....they obviously used a roux.  Shrimp.....did they buy canned shrimp from WAlmart......ugh!   Beans....not cooked proper and while had heat, had no flavor.  Andouille was tough and just not good.

If you like authentic NOLA....don't go here.  If you want some NE Cajun flavored food......and can't find better......then might be worth a visit."}
{"text":"Why haven't we been here before?? We went for restaurant week. It was crowded and a bit noisy but I didn't mind because the food was absolutely wonderful! Out server was very knowlegeable and offered great suggestions. The food was some of the best that I have eaten in a long time. (And we eat out all of the time!) This is certainly going on our list of \"go to\" restaurants. The atmosphere is nice and it would be great for a date night out or girls night. Again....the food is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Our hotel suggested the Cajun Queen 7 years ago.  We enjoyed it so much that we
made a reservation for our first night in town and were not disappointed. We had the BBQ shrimp-hot but wonderful.  Would not have thought of dipping the bread in the sauce- until it was suggested and glad it was.   Then we had gumbo, also good and finished with chicken etouffee.  Ambience is welcoming and fun, jazz was great, staff attentive, thoroughly enjoyed  the evening."}
{"text":"The service is great, the food is great.  There's not really anything I can add that hasn't been said in the other reviews.

Other than:  If you don't order the beignets for brunch, you are seriously insensé.  (that's 'insane' in french.  i think.)"}
{"text":"Try to eat here when schedule permits when in town for the race.  Had the blackened catfish for dinner as well as bbq shrimp appetizer and fried green tomatoes. Fish was plentiful and not overly spicy. Fried green tomatoes were the appetizer hit for the table.

Other dishes included salt and pepper catfish and bbq pork chop. Dessert included bread pudding and keylime pie.  Overall, another solid performance and prices are reasonable. Probably 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!! The food was so delicious that days later my husband and I were still talking about it!!! The catfish was the best that I have ever had! This is hands down one of my go to restaurants! My husband loved his chicken as well! We can't say enough good things about this restaurant! Great job Cajun queen!"}
{"text":"I love New Orleans and they're the closest thing in Charlotte. Love it!  I always get the new Orleans seafood platter."}
{"text":"I don't usually go for Cajun, but there's so much here that there's always something I'm \"in the mood\" for.  Plenty of food, so good value for the prices.  Service was fair, and probably the only thing that could be improved upon.  
Best shrimp and grits ever!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Great food. The waiter Alex is the best at what he does. Truly had a great time!!!"}
{"text":"He said:  Got there around 6 with no wait. Seated immediately. No Coke Zero. Fried tomatoes great, hot - roumelade tasty. Water glass never empty. BBQ shrimp good but not crazy good  nice heat to them only 6 shrimp tho.  Crawfish scampi quite spicy lots of crawfish.  Superior service - waitress knowledgeable about food - able to make recommendations. Drinks flowed. Added a star at end of meal because of service.

She said:  The restaurant is located in a neighborhood where many houses have been converted into businesses.  The statue of an alligator in front of the restaurant was sculpted from a tree.  I really wasn't sure what to expect, but boy, was I happy with what we walked into.  This restaurant was warm, inviting, and cozy.  The service was absolutely amazing.  Our glasses were always filled, as was our breadbasket.  In order to sample as much as possible, we decided to split four appetizers between us.  My favorite was the fried green tomatoes.  The remoulade sauce \"made\" this dish.  It was perfectly balanced and absolutely yummy!!!  If you haven't been a fan of Fried Green Tomatoes, you really should give these a try.  We also had the Cajun Fried Oysters, New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp, and Crawfish Scampi.  I've listed those in order of my favorites, though they were all good and I'd gladly have them all again.  This has been one of my favorite Yelp-finds, by far!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go on a day trip to Charlotte to see his mom since she is in town this week. I typically look at YELP for good places to eat. I was craving for some gumbo and I saw that Cajun Queen had some good reviews and I thought we should give it a try. 

I ordered Gumbo Diane with crawfish and shrimp. My husband got the shrimp and grits with salad on the side. While his mom got fried tomatoes for appetizer, 8oz filet steak, a cup of gumbo, and banana pudding. 
All three of us agreed that the food was delicious. I would highly recommend this place. 

The service was good. The facade reminds me of an old historic home, because it is in a converted house. They redesigned the interior and, with a fireplace, it feels warm and inviting. The only downside is the PARKING. We came around 12:30 pm and we had to park behind the restaurant on a side street. However, after 5 pm, there is complementary valet service."}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place.  Is that what you want to hear?  I really, honestly, truly love this restaurant.  \"What makes this place so special?\" you ask.  For me this place is the perfect marriage of great service and great food, and aren't those the very reasons we go to all these restaurants in the first place?  Service. & Food.  

The food was nothing short of pure, delectable bliss.  We (my dad and I) started with a few drinks and the New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp, \"Sautéed with Butter, Garlic, Beer and a Variety of Cajun/Creole Spices\".  It contained, 5 juicy, succulent pieces of shrimp; swimming in a small bowl of \"cajun/creole spices\"  for $8.95.  Very spicy + very tender = very good.  Don't forget to dip your bread in the broth!  

For the main course, my dad and I split the Shrimp Diane.  Now the Diane sauce contains, \"Mushrooms, Garlic, Butter, Green Onions, Parsley and Queen's Magic Spices sautéed together. Moderately spiced and served over Rice.\"  They give you the option of splitting it for only $5.00 more bringing the entree price to 23.95.  Certainly not cheap by any means, but well worth the cost.  The best way to describe the taste, is to image garlic, butter, onions, and a bunch of \"Queens Magic Spices\" working harmoniously to perfectly marinate the shrimp with the rice keeping things from getting to sloppy.  Its Cajun food at its finest.  

At that point, things were so good we just HAD to get dessert, right??  We decided to order the pecan pie.  I mean, pick an adjective - amazing, spectacular, splendid, etc.  It was served to us warm and moist (that's what HE said - LOL), as if it was just taken out of the oven, with dab of whipped cream.

The service was on point from start to finish; from the valet to the host/hostess to the super friendly bartender upstairs.  Everyone was really kind and polite. What exactly separates the staff here from other restaurants?  Its all in the details...for example, every single person said, \"be with you in one minute\" or \"be right with you\".  No one ever ignored us, or expected us to wait until we could be helped.  My drinks (adult/H2O) were never empty. We didn't have to think/worry about parking.  There was a plethora of condiments, hot sauces, etc to satisfy even the most particular taste buds.  Bathrooms were immaculate.  They had live jazz.  ...See what I mean about the details?

I'm hooked.  I'll be back very, very soon, maybe even tomorrow!  I love this place.  There.  I said it!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money! The gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever. I ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking \"no one can mess up blackened chicken\".....I was wrong. None of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper. This was the most bland, overpriced food I'd ever had in the city. I ordered my toddler the chicken strip little gators meal. The fries were the best thing out of the entire meal. The service was as also dry and not very friendly or inviting from the hostess to the waiter, Brandon. Geez, I know it's a Tuesday night (we arrived at 5:30) but at least show some enthusiasm as I arrive to spend a whopping $123 (4 entrees, 4 alcoholic bevs, 1 kids meal) on a below average meal. It would've been more had we been charged for the uneaten cup of gumbo."}
{"text":"One word: Flavor.

I snagged a few Groupons for this place after reading other Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is charming (even slightly upscale, in my opinion), the portions filling, and the food spicy and fresh.

I ordered the etouffée with chicken, shrimp, and crawfish. It was as delicious and mouth-scorchingly savory as I had hoped. (Warning: If you don't like a satisfying tongue burn, don't order the etouffée!) Most noteworthy of all, the chicken was fall-apart tender. Yum, yum, and more yum. My boyfriend ordered the blackened catfish by recommendation of the waiter, and it was just as tender and flavorful as my dish. Our waiter was also very polite. Seriously, I'm wondering if there's a way you can even go wrong at this place.

One thing: The parking is dodgy. Spots will run out, and you may get towed if you park in an adjacent lot."}
{"text":"I had the fried green tomatoes and chicken shrimp and crawfish etouffee. DELISH!!! I've had authentic Louisiana dishes many times before. This is it! Will come back."}
{"text":"We sat upstairs so we could hear the band, that was ok. What I loved was the atmosphere it reminded me of a spot in Brooklyn. The food was excellent I had the shrimp and grits, and the pumpkin cheesecake \"LOVED IT\".  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was our umpteenth visit to the \"Queen\" but brought first timer friends. It is Queens Table Week and therefore the service, while efficient, was hurried. We all felt a bit pushed. 

Being a big fan of the Crawfish Etouffee my choice was easily made. We each ordered a different entree and seemed pleased with our choices. Did I mention the service was swift? We could have finished our meal in an hour flat. Our server assumed, correctly, that we were ordering from the special menu and removed the regular menu because \"you won't be needing these\". If you want return Customers you may want to allow sufficient time to peruse the regular menu to see what other choices are available. 

Food was good, as always, but wouldn't recommend visiting during this promo week. My usual rating is 4 's but not this visit. 
Sorry got to run............."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Diane ever. Great staff, service and atmosphere....and the band! Awesome jazz band!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this particular restaurant.  I've visited New Orleans quite a few times, and was excited to get the opportunity to go there.  The atmosphere had a very intimate setting. However, I was looking forward to their catfish.  When the waiter stated that they ran out 10 minutes before we got there, we had to pay for an uncharge for a better fish.  Didn't quite understand that, since they were the ones that ran out of the catfish.  I'll go back there, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"The flavors are so rich and the portions are awesome. Service was a little slow given there wasn't a big size. But the food made up for that. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who enjoys fine dining. Also the ambiance makes it a great spot for a date night or anniversary. Throughly enjoyed my first experience. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet friends after work.  But if you want to talk, pleeease ask to be seated on the main level!  It gets very loud upstairs when the jazz band is playing, because it's a bit small (especially on the side of the floor that's away from the bar).  The servers are friendly and the food has been good (e.g., crawfish scampi, many blackened selections and desserts).  However, they are a little bit of a hit or miss on the seafood gumbo... it had no seasoning whatsoever the last time I tried it?  The food can also seem a bit pricey, but I haven't found another Cajun place that beats this one yet?  In addition, they have complimentary valet, due to limited parking around the building... unless you don't mind parking on a side street across the street, which is usually what we do if the valet looks busy or unavailable."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place when I was visiting Charlotte! First of all, it is located in an old renovated home!  It felt very cozy and felt-home like.  Upon arrival, the service was great and even asked us if we made reservation.  You can make a reservation through Yelp if you wish to!  

Another great thing about this place is I was able to find a Groupon deal which definitely helped($25 for $40 worth).  I got the Shrimp Scampi which was very well done!  The shrimp was soft and tender and the tail was still on!  I also got the fried pickles which were just delicious!   Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend it if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is \"our spot\". Our go to date night place. We've been coming here since we were in high school, class of '99, so...that's quite some time. Gosh, now I feel old. 

There are several reasons why this continues to be a favorite of ours. 

First, the neighborhood is utterly charming. An old home converted into a restaurant is adds a bazillion points to character of the restaurant. It's not brand spanking new. Nothing's been razed to the ground and rebuilt in that new minimalist style. I'm a big fan of repurposing without losing the original charm. I love love love that this place is still in a house. Take a chance to walk around the neighborhood if you like old historic homes. Some of the architecture will bring a tear to your eye. 

Second, live jazz band. Do I need to say more? There's something about a live band at a restaurant. It provides an old world elegance. I feel like I've taken a step back in time. Like I'm Dolly in the classic movie \"Hello, Dolly\" and Louis Armstrong is about to serenade me while walking to my table. 

Third, the upstairs bar and patio. One of my favorite things to do is get there 15 or 20 minutes earlier then our reservation and hang out at one of the tables in the bar. We order a plate of fried oysters with remoulade sauce, a couple drinks and just enjoy the atmosphere till our table is ready. We've had some of the best conversations just leaning against the counter sipping on sweet tea and munching on oysters. 

Fourth, is the bread. Once you make it to a table (be sure to make a reservation or you will wait forever especially peak times on the weekend) you will be blessed with a basket of hot rolls. These rolls are the perfect combination of crisp and chewy. I believe they come from Nova's bakery, or at least that is what I've been told by the waitstaff. It's rare to get bread service at a non Italian restaurant or chain steakhouse. Again, it's a throwback to old classics and deserves a hand clap! The only bummer is the butter. It comes ice cold which makes it difficult to spread. 

Fifth, is the food. I could say that food should be in the number one spot, but all these things listed prior are working together in its favor and is why this place is our favorite. The food here is a delight. I love heat and all things spicy. However, when they use spice, it doesn't over power the flavor. It isn't just spicy. It's packed full of flavor with a bit of heat that catches you at the end. One of my favorites is the chicken Diane. Sometimes I switch it up and get shrimp Diane or all 3 Diane (which is chicken, shrimp and crawfish). The Diane is rich and flavorful with mushrooms floating in buttery goodness. It is all things pleasurable. It is a mouthful of happiness and rainbows. Seriously, it's really good. If you are not a fan of garlic and mushrooms, then do not order this. Also, plan on smelling like garlic for a day or two after eating this. No vampire will want to come near you and your lover may avoid your kisses if you don't pop a mint. Trust me. Dragon breath is imminent. 

The blackened chicken is well seasoned and not dried out. It is hard to blacken chicken breast meat and still have it juicy but they nail it every time. The blackened catfish is a favorite and is a huge portion. In fact, almost all the dishes here are giant and unless you are The Rock (can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?), you might be taking home a box or two of leftovers.

Definitely try the fried oysters with remoulade. They are lightly breaded and fried. Every time we visit we just have to order them. They are tender and sweet. Perfect start to the meal. 

I've had the gumbo a couple of times as a starter. I love gumbo and the one here is good. It's not the best gumbo I've ever had but it's not the worst. I like okra and andouille sausage in addition to the shrimp and I don't think I've ever had a bowl with any of those in it. However, the rice is perfectly cooked every time. So, the gumbo might be a gamble. 

They do have a decent Ceasar salad for a starter. Nothing fancy. Just a good salad. 

I'm usually too full for dessert, but we have had the bread pudding and the key lime pie. Both are a great way to end the meal but I'd rather have the plate of oysters. 

For all the reasons stated above, this place holds the number one spot in our date nights. Cajun Queen Forever!! 

P.s. - I miss seeing queen gator. :*("}
{"text":"Great service and food! The shrimp creole was really good. We really wanted beignets but those are only served on Sunday."}
{"text":"Eh. I came in with high hopes for Cajun Queen after being somewhat disappointed with other cajun places in Charlotte. It was ok, but not something that I will go out of my way for again. I tried the shrimp and grits, as it is one of my favorite dishes. The grits were good. The shrimp started out good, but I grew tired of the seasoning by the end. The sausage was by far the best part."}
{"text":"Nice stop if you are in Charlotte. It is located in a beautiful home with an outdoor eating area on the ground and 2nd floor. 

Live jazz music permeates throughout however if you want the full experience ask to be seated on the 2nd floor.

The restaurant was relatively empty when my husband and I went (Thursday @ 2000 hours). Service was great with a very attentive waiter and busboy.

The food was hot and tasty but certainly not the best Cajun food I have had this far. The fried oysters were THE Best I have ever had. It was juicy and oh so tender.

I give this place two thumbs up and I will definitely  return.

FYI- THE 7TH STREET STUMBLER IS TRUE TO ITS NAME."}
{"text":"Well the food was just ok.  The service we received was like a wet dish cloth.   The waiter never smiled are anything.  I think he checked on us like twice and nothing more.    Please do not waste your time ordering the red beans and rice.  The beans are from the can ans have no flavor of cajun at all.   Highlu disappointed, this place use to be really good"}
{"text":"We found the restaurant on a flyer within our hotel! Looked on Yelp, and saw the comment about make a reservation and get a Groupon, so my husband and I did just that. Called at about 6pm and still got a 9:15 reservation. Parking was a bit difficult, but we will know better the next time. However, they do have free valet, we just didn't want it. 

Once we got there, we were seated immediately. Tables are close together and you typically have to sit across from your company but that was ok. The waiter came to our table promptly, and we had water and bread in no time. We order and it was delicious! The food was prepared fresh, and cooked perfectly. We ordered the Duck and the Blackened Chicken and Fish! We literally ate every bite down to the sauce. We took home some Bourbon Bread Pudding and that was delicious as well! I suggest this restaurant only to people who love great food!!! Will be going back asap!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I wish they were open for lunch! Always make a reservation or you will find yourself waiting for a table.

Great food, large portions, relatively reasonable prices. Blackened fish with the topping of the day is always a good choice! I also love the Diane with all 3 ($20.95) - Chicken, Shrimp, & Crawfish plus Mushrooms, Garlic, Butter, Green Onions, Parsley and Spices sautéed together and served over rice. This dish is huge so you won't leave hungry. Ask them to spice it up a bit if you like spicy food. The dishes are a little mild for my taste. Try, if you can, to save room for dessert. The warm bread pudding & the pecan pie are delicious. 

Cons: 
- awful parking. At least they have valet now, but who wants to wait on their car after stuffing themselves with Cajun food?
- seating is packed in way too close together. If you want an intimate date spot, this is not the place.
- drinks are tasty, but a bit watered down for the price. Not the place in Charlotte to go just for a drink or two.
- no ice cream. Seriously. How am I supposed to eat warm bourbon pecan with no ice cream???"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a taste of Louisiana, it is here! Well for a place in Charlotte at least. The atmosphere is wonderful & the jazz music they play is fun! If you sit upstairs, it might be a little too loud.

Our favorite dishes that we try to get every time are the following:
1. Crawfish Diane with Mashed Potatoes
2. BBQ Shrimp 
3. Mahi Mahi with Shrimp Topping (Special of The Day)
4. Fried Oyster Appetizer 

They also have great drinks! We always get the 
1. Swamp Water
2. Gator Juice"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon to use here.

I can't say I'm a good judge of Cajun food, or very adventurous to try many of the spices & flavors of the true Cajun food.  

I ordered the Creole Chicken which was not too spicy, lots of chicken and lots of rice.  It was definitely a two meal meal.  

They have free valet parking because sometimes it can be hard to find in the area.  There is also a live jazz band upstairs that can be loud - but also very good and entertaining.

The alligator statue out front is broken, I hope they fix it soon!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place more but I can't give it more than three stars. Yes, it is different and they have good deals.  Colorful place, bar upstairs.  Frankly, just average though. Loud music that I just wasn't into."}
{"text":"Recommended Place.  The food was great and the staff equally great. A really nice place."}
{"text":"Yummy food and  fun environment.  Don't expect any new age, trendy, food here, they serve true to form cajun food.  Prepare to leave here stuffed.   However, the service can sometimes stink due to it's high volume of patrons.  Anticipate long wait times and mediocre service if they are busy."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved everything we had at Cajun Queen. I had the crawfish etouffee and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of spice, perfect ratio of rice to crawfish and nice portion size. My boyfriend had the cajun chicken pasta and oh my goodness, the sauce let me tell you...its out of this world!! I loved the veggies in his pasta as well. To finish off our meal we shared the bread pudding, it was great as well and fresh out of the oven. My only complaint is I would have liked more caramel sauce because it was that fantastic! 

Now onto the ambiance, this restaurant is actually an older house. I love how they have things split into separate rooms, it gives it a more intimate feeling. The place really gives off a cool vibe. 

Service was amazing, our waiter was super personable and friendly. He never let us run out of anything! 

We will definitely be back in the future and I recommend that everyone give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Had a party of 10 here on Friday at 6:30pm. When i arrived, table was ready for us. I was the first to sit and wait for the others. 

Layout: 4/5 it can be a little confusing but with the hostess leading we were ok. 

Hostess: 5/5 the two hostesses were great and lead us to our table. 

Waiter: Brandon, 5/5 he was great. Make sure my water was filled. Never missed anything. 

Food: Gumbo soup 2/5. Very watery. And left a funny after taste in my mouth. I had a spoonful and sent it back 

Fried catfish w/mashed potatoes and broccoli 5/5. I truly enjoyed this dish.. it wasn't over fried. Fall apart and melt in my mouth that go perfectly with the mashed potatoes! 

With my surrounding, the food except the gumbo and the service. I genuinely enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"This place is defiantly done if the best New Orleans style Cajun food in the city! Everytime I go here I always have a great food experience. The atmosphere is homey...literally it's in a house! Unfortunately because of that not all seats are great seats, sit too close to a window in the winter you'll regret it! Also the seats could be too close for comfort. My favorite thing here is the etouffee! It has just the right amount of Cajun spice without it being overwhelming. 
Beware, parking sucks here with the potential of being towed or blocked is high! Pay attention to signs and try to find somewhere on the street."}
{"text":"The owner could care less about customers. He is the rudest man. The food is so so. Nothing Cajun about it. They did not use our Groupon correctly. That was fine with us, but why couldn't the server tell us. Not just toss the bill on the table and walk away. Save your money and dine elsewhere. The Cajun Yard Dog is far better, and far more Cajun cuisine."}
{"text":"Easy to get reservations, prompt service, and DELICIOUS food!  I had the crayfish etoufee - rich and yummy.  Others had the chicken creole, shrimp & grits, & fried shrimp.  All reported yummy!  Nice atmosphere, too.  Took a kiddo (18mo.) and it was fine for her.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere so I have it three stars. From someone who has been to New Orleans multiple times I can say confidently that the food here is bland has no flavor. They lack the spices and seasonings that true authentic Cajun food has. I ordered the shrimp etoufee and my fiancé ordered the pan seared duck breast. Both looked decent but essentially lacked flavor and the comfort you get from eating good ol New Orleans Cajun food."}
{"text":"The best BBQ shrimp I've EVER had. The sauce is good for dipping the bread. Definitely going back again. Shrimp and grits are okay, but I've been to Hominy Grill in Charleston, SC and theirs is the best. Service was awesome, as our waiter was great!"}
{"text":"Having been to NOLA and experiencing the amazing food scene it's hard to imagine anywhere outside of LA being able to match the quality of food; however, this restaurant is awesome.  The etouffe was spot on, shrimp and grits creamy, the Cajun popcorn was a delightful surprise and the scampi unlike any other ever tried. 

Great place to celebrate or just enjoy a great taste of new Orleans."}
{"text":"We took advantage of a $40 Groupon on a Tuesday night.  The evening was wonderful with good food, good wine, and good service (Thx Anna).  We were seated upstairs in a little corner and listened to the band while sipping an Old Vine Zinfandel--hard to top!

My wife took advantage of their 30 yr anniversary menu for $30; me, a 1 lbs. ribeye with Mushroom Diana on top.  There was so much food we split our entrees and doggy-bagged 8 oz of steak (yummy the next day, too).  The ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare.  Cajun Queen is a great place with valet parking which is a no-brainer.  

PS:  Tried booking through Open Table that stated no openings.  When I called direct, no problem.  Great . . . table for two, please!"}
{"text":"I went last Friday to celebrate my 5 year wedding anniversary. Our 2 year old daughter was with us as well. The place was alot busier than I was expecting. It was such an exciting atmosphere. We loved it! My daughter said to us \"wow, were at a party\". The music band plays upstairs and that is where we were seated. We had a short wait around 10 minutes and the manager seated us right in front of the band as if he read my mind. That is exactly where we wanted to sit. I'm not a fan of spicy food and the waiter recommended instead of blackened, I can order the fish or chicken to be grilled and it was amazing. The popcorn crawfish was excellent. Beers were $3, $4 The whole experience was great, fun and we spent only $80 including the tip. I had spent more than double that at Villa Antonio a few months back for my wife's 30th bday and did not have as nice of a time. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone wanting to have more than just your average dinner at applebees :)"}
{"text":"While visiting the Queen City, I stopped by with my cousin and one of my best friends who happen to live there. Upon arrival I was quite smitten because the place is housed in an old house that has been converted into a restaurant. It was cute and quaint with lots of photos and paintings of New Orleans scenery. We were seated upstairs in what was probably the old master bedroom with the band. The service was good, the young woman was friendly and very helpful.

For appetizers we ordered fried crawfish and gumbo. Both were okay, nothing to write home about. I chose the etouffee with everything for an entrée, along with a side of red beans and rice. My cousin ordered the New Orleans Platter, while my friend had the Diane. Both of my companions thoroughly enjoyed their meals and could not stop singing the praises. Again I thought my etoufee was just okay. I have had much better. I did, however, really enjoy the red rice and beans and thought to myself that maybe I should have just ordered that with some bbq shrimp and called it a day. 

Would I visit them again? Of course, I always give everything two chances. :)"}
{"text":"We came here because of the good reviews but weren't impressed whatsoever. Very bland tasting food. Service was good though. Will not be back nor will recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Loved, loved, loved it.  The shrimp and grits were awesome.  The gumbo was awesome.  The service was great.  The wine list was impressive.  I was totally won over, and want to go again.  Now.  Today.  Sigh.  Too bad I'm half a country away."}
{"text":"I really love the Cajun food here. Shrimp etoufee excellent. It's even better when there is live jazz too. It's an old house, so the place has a distressed feel."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Cajun Queen one night as a date night.  I was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance.  We booked a late night dinner due to his schedule  and when we arrived, the jazz band was already on break.  We were seated but our waitress appeared to not to want to be there.  I ordered the New Orleans ice tea and my fiance ordered sweet tea, it took a while before the drinks were delivered and let me tell you - It wasn't nothing to brag about.  The food was spicy not flavorful, just spicy.  Even the couple beside us was a little perplexed about it just being spicy (a little eavesdropping).  Needless, to say not a great experience.  So fortunate that I was able to get a group-on discount and not pay for a $70 experience that I didn't enjoy.  I wouldn't return or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat... Food is excellent. Always enjoy.  Haven't found Cajun as good anywhere else in this area."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place and Boudreaux's has the same rate. Being a native New Orleanian I am spoiled by my roots. Cajun Queen is as close as it gets to the real deal. The only thing I just do not care for, but just my personal preference is the gumbo, tomatoe-based, so I am just not a fan. The brunch is amazing, and surprisingly I love the pork dish with bananas, yummo"}
{"text":"Let me just say the only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because my boyfriend liked it. We went here as our second restaurant for restaurant week. The wine (cabernet) was decent enough. For the appetizer we ordered the gumbo and the caesar salad. I can't rate the gumbo because I'm not a fan of what's in it. I was told it was good though. The salad was just a salad nothing great. For the main course we ordered the chicken etouffee and the cajun chicken pasta. The chicken in the etouffe was the same texture and taste as you'd get from takeout chinese food which my boyfriend said that's why he liked it. The sauce was okay but it didn't save the dish. The cajun chicken pasta was ehhh. It was eatable but again I'd never go back for it. Dessert consisted of bread pudding and key lime pie. The boyfriend liked his bread pudding but I wasn't a fan and my key lime pie was good but I would swear it was Sarah Lee!! I feel no need to ever come back to Cajun Queen, the food just wasn't great and really a spice let down considering it's supposed to be cajun and it's not a very comfortable restaurant."}
{"text":"Love NOLA? Then you'll love Cajun Queen. The atmosphere is beautifully inspired bu the best New Orleans has to offer. The food is AMAZING, seriously amazing. i had the gumbo and the New Orleans Platter and it was oh so tasty."}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is my favorite Cajun Resturant in the world by far!  The shrimp étouffée is to die for. The ambience and service are great as well.  A must stop in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nice, down home atmosphere. The service is excellent. The food is well prepared.  My only complaint is that while the food was prepared well, it was somewhat bland and forgetful.  Overall, it's a nice place but judging on food alone, it's ok."}
{"text":"now, that's what i'm talkin' about! 
definitely one of the first meals i had after moving to the QC. a little on the expensive side, but worth it. 
it's in this cute house, with a small parking lot in the back. you can't miss it because there's a GIANT GATOR out front. 
i started off with the bbq shrimp app-- oh, man! soooo spicy my nose ran, i love it! i had the red beans and rice with andouille (both sides) as my entree (kind of like a create your own meal :) ) the shrimps were so spicy the red beans and rice cooled me down. 
can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awful!  Was with friends for a Birthday and it was 19 degrees outside that night.  The reservation was for 13 and 5 of us got there first.  The hostess said we could go upstairs to the bar. So we did. There was no one there and the chairs were already on top of the tables as if they were closing.  We went back downstairs and asked to be seated. There was only one table in the entire restaurant that had 2 people at it.  The hostess told us we would not be seated until our entire party was there. The birthday boy called the other people that we were waiting on and at the last minute they canceled. We told the hostess the reservation would now be for 5 and not 13. She rolled her eyes and looked at us and in a sarcastic demeaning tone said \"so you're telling me now that instead of 13 there were only be 5?\"  And we said yes. At that point I was ready to leave. But we stayed. The food was horrible and they included the tip without asking. I will never go back to this restaurant no matter what, even if they offer me free food three times a day for life.  I was so mad. I will never never never never never go back.  Horrible customer service and horrible food."}
{"text":"Stopped by Cajun Queen for a friends birthday, and the atmosphere was nice. We sat on the patio and enjoyed some wine and good conversation. I know my fellow diners had fantastic meals, however my 3 star rating is for their lack of vegetarian dishes. There wasn't anything on the menu (aside from ordering a plate full of sides and that get really old) so the waiter suggested the one item they had available for veggie friendly patrons. It was sufficient but not something I would normally order. Either way, I would certainly go back if there were a few more entree options for peeps like me."}
{"text":"I am new to Charlotte and was suggested by a local to try this place which she raved about, so for my birthday I decided to go. The food was great. For my appetizer I had the Cajun fried oysters. For my entree I had the Creole Shrimp with rice it was spicy, which I like. There was a live jazz band playing which was nice. The only con I had was it being a little tight. It's in a house which was made into a restaurant. I dined on the 2nd floor and it was 8 of us. The waiters had us sit directly behind a table that had all the utensils and drinks. So they'd constantly have to come up behind us to grab napkins, more water or lemonade, or utensils for other tables. Other than that it was nice. Not sure if I'll go back but if I do I won't go with a large group, most likely for a date night with my hubby."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The service was fast and our server was very friendly. I really liked the live jazz band that was playing upstairs it helped with the authentic New Orleans feel. The complimentary valet was a nice touch. We will definitely come back to the Cajun Queen in the near future."}
{"text":"It's safe to say the Cajun Queen is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte. I'm from Texas, so I grew up sampling a variety of Cajun dishes. Since I live within walking distance, I've had the pleasure of coming to Cajun Queen countless times. Sometimes I stray and try a new dish, but overall I usually go for the usual - bowl of seafood gumbo and a side of crawfish étouffée which is more than enough to fill me up. Their fried oysters are divine; perfectly juicy with light crunchy breading. If you go in the evenings, you'll be serenaded by the cutest old men band that croon most big band type hits. Great place!"}
{"text":"Gumbo is disappointing if you're familiar with New Orleans food. Otherwise, they really kill it! Specials are always delicious, and the crawfish scampi is something else!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with our neighbors for drinks and some spicy cajun fare. The ambiance was interesting...basically the restaurant is in an old school home. The downstairs was quiet but the upstairs was the total opposite. The bar and the live jazz band is upstairs. The jazz band is actually reall good but if you are going here for a good conversation then you might as well let them know upfront that you would prefer sitting downstairs. Personally our group liked the live music. Prices are decent and food is as well. The service was a bit slow mainly coz the place was packed!! 
I ordered the Spicy chicken etouffe which was awesome. I ordered it extra spicy and man they meant it. My hubby however said that his blackened catfish was \"eh\". Still this is a good place to chill out with friends on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Always a great experience! The live jazz music was delightful and the food was AMAZING! Get the BBQ Shrimp appetizer and Shrimp and grits for your entree! You will not be disappointed. Will be back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Had a Groupon, otherwise don't think the food is worth it. Way overpriced for some rice and a few pieces of shrimp with minimal flavor. Service was also sub par"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  I have been there twice and the food has been outstanding.  Try the catfish - it is yummy."}
{"text":"Ever go out to eat and order the condiments you want with your meal order? THE CONDIMENTS CAME OUT BEFORE THE MEAL!!!!    BOOM!    (Biggest pet peeve ever! I didn't ask for lemons and butter because I plan to gargle with it after dinner, I want it to put on my hot steak or fish or whatever I am eating that evening) 
Kudos to the bar staff and Melissa for excellent service.  Perfect dining experience minus the hot date but that wasn't Cajun Queens fault.   Cheers!

Etoufeé is still the best in charlotte."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Service and food are always consistently good.  Heres a few pics of our dinner last night: chicken diane, shrimp scampi, fried green tomatoes. Also, love the rolls they start you with. Use the valet parking too."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, great staff, drinks were amazing and the food was delicious. The 7th Street Gator Band was really cool & they brought that Nawlins flare. Thanks again to staff Aaron for being attentive and welcoming. I will return soon."}
{"text":"Honestly I'd give it a 3.75. Food was good but not amazing. HUGE portions for food - which is good except the tables are a little small. We had 3 people at a 4 person table and it was cramped - 4 people would've been too much. Table clothes would help a lot I think. I wouldn't recommend the specialty drinks. Andouille sausage was not andouille but it was good. Overall I'd go back but it wouldn't be first on my list."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. it was hard to believe I was in Charlotte and not New Orleans."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I gave Cajun Queen another try! I had a really bad first experience, so I didn't have high hopes when I returned for my second visit. 

We came here with my parents on a Saturday. Make sure you make a reservation because they were super busy. I started my meal with a hurricane, which was awesome and extra strong! 

For dinner I got the creole Cajun rice with chicken, shrimp and crawfish. It had the perfect amount of spice, but you can ask for more spice on the side! Most importantly, there was a huge amount of seafood in it and the chicken included two breast! It was so much food! My parents got the catfish and the chicken Diane. Can't go wrong with the Diane. My husband got it on our first visit and I thought it was delicious. 

They also always have a Groupon. Make sure to check that out before you head here!

I'm glad I gave them a second chance!"}
{"text":"I thought it was a good time..food was good..music was good..space was a little tighter than I expected...staff was very nice and on point..all n all I'd do it again"}
{"text":"Got the crawfish ettuofe.  It was the best Cajun food I have ever had. Absolutely fantastic. Spicy and extremely flavorful. A must go for any traveler."}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype about this place. Everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre. I did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable. I got the shrimp Diane which I'm pretty sure was just shrimp, mushrooms, white rice and chicken broth. Thank God I only went bc I had a groupon."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant great atmosphere and the Cajun food was delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant especially for a date night."}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans myself, I must say...THE FOOD IS AMAZING AND VERY AUTHENTIC! Great Atmosphere and superb customer service. Food comes out pretty fast as well. I was torn between the Blacken Chicken and Diane...I'm coming back to try the Diane next time. I know it will be just as good as the Blacken Chicken pasta! I have been living in Charlotte for 7 months now and literally live 2 mins away from this restaurant. I always get disappointed when trying true New Orleans dishes. I'm glad I finally stopped to eat. I was not let down! My new favorite place"}
{"text":"We came for my sister's birthday dinner and had aN excellent time! They have complimentary valet, great service, good food, and the live jazz music was a nice touch! 

For appetizers we tried the fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, BBQ shrimp, and crawfish. All of it was amazing!! 

The filet was on point and the Caesar salad and garlic mash were good, too! Literally have no complaints!"}
{"text":"This place was great! My bf and I went on a Monday night. There was live jazz that was very nice. We both got the ettouffe, mine was crawfish and his was chicken and shrimp. We both loved it and the drinks as well. What attracted us was a deal on groupon but we will definitely be returning! The only negative I would say was the close proximity of the seating in the upstairs room--we were literally right next to another couple and heard their entire (and very awkward) conversation."}
{"text":"I went to college in New Orleans, and so I think I am fairly qualified to judge cajun food.  That being said, the food here was not all that great.  The fried dishes I tried, including fried green tomatoes and some fried seafood, were delicious and accompanied by great sauces.  The typical Nola food didn't fair as well.  The gumbo was heavy on the tomato, and poorly seasoned, and the red beans and rice was virtually flavor-free.  I enjoyed eating here, but I wouldn't return for cajun food (I would return for the fried food, it was delish).  I might have been more forgiving with the food if it hadn't been so expensive (about $20 per person).  Oh, and the tea was instant or nestea or something."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied and disappointed.  Will not go back.  Went over year ago and was disappointed in the shrimp and grits.  This time,  gave another shot and tried oysters and shrimp.  They were good but the only options to come with it was mashed potatoes and coleslaw and broccoli.   The very bland potatoes were cold, the slaw my husband got was not good, & the broccoli was just a giant tree on the plate.   The side house salad we ordered for an additional $4 was awful.   There were romaine core in the salad and one slice of cucumber.  The leaves were so huge that it looked like it was just thrown on the plate without thought.  The waiter was loud and annoying and our drinks ran out several times.   Having to ask someone to refill drinks.....the \"complimentary\" valet was not something I want forced on us either but we had no choice.  When it was time to retrieve our car, it was raining and we had to get it ourselves because the drivers were too busy parking other cars to get ours.  Do not go here if you want good food and a nice evening."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance,  music was jazzy and not too loud.
Parking is a bit nerve wracking but valet parking helps. 

Attentive servers. New Orleans fried platter and etoufee was tasty. Gumbo seemed to be missing a bit of seasoning. Hurricane was nice but not as strong as expected.

We enjoyed our first visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food the price is comparable especially on the creole dishes. You have to make reservations if you want to get a good seat otherwise come before six o'clock."}
{"text":"Nice lil spot. I went right at 5 so I can avoid a crowd because I didn't know packed it gets. My only problem was the parking. Can't find a spot to save my life. But the valet guy was cool. I gave him a tip to park my car because I just got tired of looking. Seafood was good. But the menu is pretty steep but if u get a living social voucher like I did, it pretty much evens out."}
{"text":"Good quality food, but lacking the full flavor of Louisiana  seasoning and spice.  We had BBQ shrimp, red beans & rice, fried and blackened shrimp and catfish which were all good, but do not compare to restaurants in New Orleans.  Prompt service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food!  awesome place - I love restaurants in hold houses.  Parking was a little strange, until you figure out only valet is available."}
{"text":"Great food. Hurricane wasn't boozey enough, but hey, it's not actually NOLA. Go with the fried oysters for sure!!"}
{"text":"I love the Cajun Queen - the food is great and spicy, the live band is awesome and jazzy and it is fun to celebrate and dine with close friends in this bourbon street atmosphere on the second floor (minus the flashing of course)

I have been here many times over 20 years and will keep coming back as long as I'm around."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! The Shrimp and grits was superb and the fried green tomatoes were awesome. It's so hard to find such good southern food in Boston and to come down to Charlotte to visit this beautiful city is well worth it."}
{"text":"I really like Cajun Queen. I have been several times now, and the food has always been great. 
The decor is unique and interesting and really helps in conveying a whimsical mood. 
Portion sizes are generous and it is hard not to fill up on the main dishes. Dessert, especially the bread pudding is worth saving room for. 
The service has always been friendly, although it can be a little slow at time. This is not a place for a quick bite to eat and more of a restaurant for a leisurely 2-3 hour dinner. 
Noise levels can get a little high depending on where you are seated. 

Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I've tried almost everything and have never once been disappointed. Great staff and even better environment. Nothing beats Cajun Queen!!"}
{"text":"I visited Charlotte and  I must admit this was the highlight of my stay. Some of the best food I have ever tasted. Authentic food at its best."}
{"text":"3 people sat down...
Interesting old house feel to the place. 
#1 - Etouffee shrimp - good shrimp, pretty good spice to it, nothing special that would bring me back
#2 - Etouffee crawfish -  good crawfish but just like any other (customer 2 preferred this over the shrimp)
#3 - Wash Day Blues - red beans and rice were blander than usual and the sausage was not cut up, hot sauce only can do so much

Fried Green Tomatoes appetizer was a hit with the whole table. 
Dixie Blackened voodoo was delicious."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Fantastic food and service!  Fernando was our waiter and was very pleasant and attentive.  We had the crawfish scampi, gumbo, and étouffee (with chicken, shrimp, crawfish, and sausage.  Thumbs up on everything!  I made reservations via Yelp and we were running late due to traffic and called ahead and they let us change our time to a half hour later (1:15 min drive turned into an 1:45 min drive).  When I made reservations I stated in the comments that it was our fist time there and we were celebrating our 1 yr anniversary and the gave us complimentary key lime cake to mark the occasion.  We will be going back for sure and hope to get Fernando again."}
{"text":"This place you have to make RSVP on the weekend.. o have to make our RSVP for Sunday morning..
I did not get the pleasure of the live Jazz but when I am back in ty City I will experience the jazz..
Fernando was amazing.. I mean amazing..

So our RSVP was at 12:30 and we did not leave until
5. Our waiters was nothing but kind... the Good was all ALL delicious every sing thing that the four of us orders.
My oysters were perfectly fried.... my first time there and every time I am in Charlotte I will be here..
You will not be disappointed at..."}
{"text":"Throughly enjoyed the crawfish Diane. Wonderfully flavored and a large plate of yummy. Plenty left for lunch. Nice atmosphere too. Felt like being in Nawlins."}
{"text":"Cajun / Nola in the Charlotte, Yes please. 

This place has many traditional New Orleans options in a cool looking old house made into a restaurant. All kinds of meat, seafood, and good grub. 

I had the New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp (sautéed with butter, garlic, beer and a variety of Cajun/Creole spices. Served over rice). This dish was top notch and made me very happy.

Taking down one star because the service could have been better and more friendly.

They have live music upstairs but since I was here to catchup with old co-workers, we took the first floor so we could talk.

Will be back during a future CLT trip."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Cajun Queen and always try to stop by when in Charlotte.  The food is good. the atmosphere is very quaint.  The catfish was delish, the gumbo was good.  The waiter was less than attentive.... he did not bring our drinks we had to ask /remind multiple times.  I asked that my entrée not have carbs /mashed potatoes and instead do a salad.   This was totally forgotten and my plate had to go back to the kitchen.   Other than that unfortunate experience the evening was great"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in the level of customer service provided to my friend & her partner by the manager. I recommended Cajun Queen for my friend & her partner to visit during their time in Charlotte. While sitting on the outside patio this past Saturday (May 5), the manager on duty was attentive & courteous to another couple; asking about the quality of their meal, if they had any additional needs, etc. but totally disregarded my friend & her partner. Both couples were sitting in close proximity so this was not an oversight by the manager, he intentionally chose to completely ignore & disregard other patrons. Disappointing. I will no longer recommend Cajun Queen."}
{"text":"We were in town for my job this past weekend and decided we were in the mood for Cajun food.  This place is in a super cute purple house in a neighborhood.  The place was packed and I was so glad I had a reservation!  We got there around 7:15 and people kept coming after us.

TIP: there is complementary valet parking so bring some cash so you can tip these guys on the way out.

I started with a Bell's Two Hearted from a nice little beer menu.  At only $4 a bottle this is a great value.  Then we split an appetizer of fried green tomatoes.  I was so glad we decide to split since it was 5 very thick slices of tomato breaded and fried.  The presentation could've been a bit better - they were placed on a bed of greens, but the sauce was just dumped over two of the slices and you had to figure out how to get it onto the other three.  It was just OK.  I've had better at The Roosevelt in RVA.

My entree was stellar.  I had the crawfish etouffee which was nicely spicy and had a HUGE AMOUNT of crawfish.  I am often disappointed with the level of heat and this was just the way I like it."}
{"text":"The cajun here is fairly original...considering.  The atmosphere is unique in this old home as you can sit downstairs or up.  I've only been once, but will return if I get back in the area.  They had a live dixie band upstairs so that's where we dined...loud but entertaining!"}
{"text":"Amazing Fried Green Tomatoes and Blackened Pork Tenderloin.  I will order both of these next time I go back.  Very cool atmosphere in a cozy old house.  Live bands play upstairs and it can be loud, so sit downstairs if you want to enjoy your conversation."}
{"text":"Very tasty with big portions to leave you satisfied. We loved the fried oysters (forewarning: the texture is a bit different), the etouffe, and the blackened chicken pasta, as well as the blackened salmon with shrimp on top. Each meal came with a cup of gumbo and free bread was brought out before anything. To say the least, we were stuffed leaving with full bellies and doggy bags of leftovers. Very flavorful food within a cool, renovated old home."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's more of an upscale cajun joint. If you are looking for fancy cajun - this is your place. I prefer a good dive (there was one down the street from this place - Bayou Kitchen - it deserves honorable mention - it was a better example of real cajun food). The food is good - the location - also nice. I took one star away because it's not as good as the place that was just down the street."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday Brunch at around 11:45am.  The ambience  inside and outside is cool.  Nice place to go to drink eat and chat with a friends.

~Service was just ok.  waiter seemed bothered...maybe he had a hard night.  (We will try the Pineville location next time....lol)

-Fried Green Tomatoes were delicious (will order again)
-Eggs Benedict on Crab Cakes was very tasty. (will order again)
-Key Lime Pie was good but its more of a white cream mouse filling style than a yellow custard filling style. ( I prefer the custard style)."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are great. I would have not gone here based on the name but so glad I went. Also used a Groupon and the service was stellar. I'd recommend this place for a date in a minute. The live band did a great job and made the dining experience a plus. Make sure to make reservations so you can get a seat near the live band."}
{"text":"Visited at the end of December and it was our first time. We were a large group together for a work function. The food was hands down the best- I had the Cajun pasta, the cream sauce was perfection. The owner let us in a bit early and the service was excellent. Such great food and definitely will be taking my family back."}
{"text":"Charming restaurant that literally makes you feel at home. Great ambiance. Feels like you're having dinner at a friends house. The seating was cozy and intimate. The food is delicious and flavorful. I ordered the blackened catfish and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My date had the shrimp diane, which he said was wonderful. We had the bread pudding for dessert. It was good. I never had bread pudding with peaches in it. It was unique. Our waiter was friendly and took good care of us. We had a great time at Cajun Queen and we can't wait to go back again soon."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and a half on a Saturday night for a table.  Bar area super crowded with one bartender and the speaker system screaming out reservation last names every few minutes at deafening decibels. No place to sit--and tarot card reader girl took up a whole table in the bar. Mediocre wine by the glass and only four rubbery shrimp (although the sauce was great--but we had to ask for bread after they brought the dish )in the $9 BBQ shrimp appetizer.  Finally seated in the room with music (which we requested and they honored) and the music was very average and too loud. We asked for water with no ice and the waiter actually rolled his eyes at us.  5 minutes later the waitress came and asked what we wanted with her order pad out, and we said, \"menus\". She finally brought some for us and the table next to us and left.  Another waitress came by and we asked if there was any way to turn the air-conditioning down since it was blowing directly on us, and she walked away without saying anything. First waitress came back and took the order of the table next to us which was seated after us and walked away without taking our order.  We had to call someone over to say we wanted to order.  They found our waitress and conveyed our request to her, and we saw her roll her eyes too. So, we decided to leave without eating since the charm of the Cajun Queen had long since left before we got there.....hard to park, noisy, and apathetic service.  Next Saturday, we are saying bye to the bayou by staying away from 7th Ave......"}
{"text":"I want to love Cajun Queen, I really do. I try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt when they fall short, understanding that things happen sometimes outside of their control. That said, Cajun Queen has continually failed to provide a satisfactory dining experience for us on 3 consecutive visits. The food alone would earn 4 stars for the advertised menu prices - although they do offer special discount deals fairly often. The customer service however is consistently dissapointing, to the point where I am convinced that the management staff needs to be changed. The attitude toward customers is not one of \"How can I help make your experience better?\" it instead seems to me that all of the workers are more into talking to eachother while dropping items at tables without saying a word. This is not just one bad egg, it seems to be everyone from the water boy to the manager. A friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at Cajun Queen. In my opinion the lack of customer service ability is a direct result of the management failing to instill those abilities in their employees. 

If you get seated at the two person table in a hallway between the kitchen and 2 dining rooms just ask to be moved. That table is terrible and does not belong in any restaurant that has any respect for its customers. And that's just it, there seems to be a lack of respect amongst the staff for their customers here. The hostess at the door stares at her computer while talking to you without ever making eye contact, the bread boy just drops the bread at your table without a word. Water boy, same thing. Server doesn't exchange pleasantries, just straight to drinks and apps. Manager walks by and talks to his buddy about the game but doesn't acknowledge the guest at the table as his conversation is overpowering ours. Workers come barelling through with a table they are moving without saying 'pardon me' or anything at all. On the way out the door the manager guy just stands there staring at the hostess' computer screen without so much as saying thanks have a good night...

We have kept returning to Cajun Queen always hoping our next experience would prove to be better, but sadly I think we have now given up. The food earns a 4 star recomendation and it is worth experiencing, but the service is 2 star at best."}
{"text":"Christian is the best server of all time! Yummy delicious food as well! Went to celebrate birthday, bar seemed a little backed up, but wonderful food. Christian. Pork tenderloin! Oh, and Christian the server. A"}
{"text":"We come here every year after the Heroes Con. I think this is our 5th or so year. It's a damn shame we only get to come once a year since we don't live in Charlotte. We ordered the shrimp and grits, the etouffe, the Diane- party of 8. Everyone looks forward to this meal and we were not disappointed this year. Lovely loaf of bread as well. Service was friendly and efficient (started a tiny bit rough but corrected quickly) 

It was Fathers Day but the place was empty. I'm worried! Hope it was just a slow night for them. I don't know why it's not packed every night. They solved the parking issue with Valet parking so you have no excuses."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for dinner in years. Brunch in a few years as well. I don't know why I haven't been here more recently. Great service and the food was fantastic. I had the shrimp/chicken Diane with a salad. I think what would have made the dish even better was a little char on the chicken/shrimp. We sat on the outside patio and it was a perfect night for this weather wise. The servers were attentive and did a great job with the flow of our dinner."}
{"text":"We started off with what everyone suggested, yes the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Cajun Popcorn (Fried Crawfish). It was awesome. The green tomatoes were not sour and it came with a sauce that made it tangy. This sauce also came with the fried crawfish and it complemented with it well.

I ordered the Diane with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish) my mother ordered the chicken, my father ordered the pork chop, and my brother followed with everyone's recommendation of the BBQ shrimp.

The Diane: absolutely to die for. It wasn't extremely spicy, the spice and kick came from the use of pepper and maybe a dash of cayenne pepper. But it was creamy, and with the mushrooms, chicken, crawfish, and shrimp it was amazing. I have to personally say that this was probably the best dish, or tied with the pork chop at least.

The chicken was probably the worse of the 4 dishes there, but on the bright side we did order the 3 good dishes. Next, the Pork Chop:
This was awesome as well. The flavor was just off the chain! It wasn't spicy, but that sauce they added to the pork chop had a tangy flavor and then it was sweet as well. The meat was also well cooked, juices just coming out of it. Delicious.

The last dish BBQ Shrimp:
If you're a spicy dish lover, this is the dish you should get. My father as well as brother found it pretty spicy (I did too), but whoa. The flavor on the shrimp as well as the rice was absolutely delicious (before the kick of the spiciness of course). It had a tangy sweet taste to it at first, then it just kicks back. 

Parking was kinda crappy, but it goes well with the environment and ambiance of the restaurant. A house/restaurant gives it a homey feel, as well as a high class dining experience. But, parking and getting out of that parking lot is a pain. *Note, there is an exit/entrance at the back of the parking lot as well as the front to 7th street.* (But I would recommend to enter from 7th street)

I hope I have stirred your taste buds in trying something new and unique from Charlotte. Because mine was!"}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is great for Charlotte but it's not the best cajun/creole I've had.  In my opinion, their food is good but leave's something to be desired if you've had great cajun/creole food. The apps here are good and the etouffee is alright.  Definitely make reservations when you come, as they only serve dinner (brunch on Sundays) and always have a crowd. They have \"complimentary\" valet service, and I would definitely recommend using it since they don't have an assigned lot. The live band is great and the service is very attentive. Solid restaurant if you want something different from the norm in the QC."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise to find in Charlotte. Thank goodness for the valets because parking is a bear in that area.

I ordered the crawfish etoufee and the waiter suggested adding some andouille sausage. Great choice. The roux was spiced just right and was as smooth as silk. Too many places either scorch the roux or make it too watery. These folks nailed it.

Would have loved some French bread garlic toast with it but the dinner rolls were very good."}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is a really quaint restaurant. It has an old Southern feel to it. The wait staff is PHENOMENAL, very hands on and attentive. Now lets get to the food...AMAZING. Sampled a few items from others and it was delicious. The table was thoroughly pleased. I didn't know they offered Brunch. It was a welcoming surprise. Will be back"}
{"text":"Went during restaurant week and can say that I wasn't impressed. Food tasted rather bland. The parking is a headache, parked in a spot but was told to move. Didn't  know they had complimentary parking until at the front door. They parked vehicles in no parking areas. Overall I wasn't impressed, but glad I tried it for myself. But try it for yourself."}
{"text":"If you want crawfish, this is the place. The etouffee is to die for. I look forward to coming back and trying out brunch."}
{"text":"Instant classic! Can't believe we haven't tried this place before. My wife and I ate here this evening for the first time. We had the BBQ shrimp and the pan seared duck, per the recommendation of our waiter, Joey. We highly recommend both! They provide complementary valet parking for dinner, which is necessary due to limited parking nearby, so plan accordingly to tip your valet."}
{"text":"Good food and cool atmosphere.  If you have a craving for cajun food and you are in Charlotte, then this is the place for you.  There's live jazz music and a bar upstairs.  The etoufee with chicken, shrimp, and crawfish makes for a delicious meal.  The seafood gumbo is pretty good, but nothing exceptional.  There are times when the parking is kind of a hassle there; the private parking area is often full."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here last night in part because of the great deal we got from groupon and the fact that they have a good selection of Abita beers.  

The shrimp étouffée and shrimp diane that we got were both quite good, and the service was pretty decent as well.  They forgot a few things, but were nice people at least.   The location is pretty nice and we were able to take a walk around the block afterwards to help digest (why the hell is 7th street totally paved over into some 5 lane highway... slow down people).

Having just gone to New Orleans a few months ago, I'm glad that Charlotte has a place to get  this type of food, although it's still not perfectly on point.

Live Jazz never hurts (but if you sit downstairs you won't be able to see it and probably can't hear it too well either)."}
{"text":"Once again the food is great, and atmosphere is awesome! However, the server and food runner or the guy refill drinks are so so....

We tried the crawfish popcorn, dinner special sirloin steak with crawfish étouffée, and crawfish and shrimp creole. They are very good, especially the dinner special."}
{"text":"I came  to charolette on 11/ 20 for my birthday weekend. My  friend made reservations for us to come to this restaurant. When you walk in, it looks like a house that was converted into a restaraunt which was awesome!  It definitely has a new orleans feel. We ordered drinks & appetizers. The  waiter also gave us a side of red beans and rice. I had a hurricane and fried green tomatoes. For my entrée,  I ordered fried catfish,  steamed broccoli and coleslaw and it was amazing!! The catfish filets were huge and plentiful! The  prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. The fish was seasoned and fried to perfection. The service, and ambience was amazing! My friend & I were celebrating our birthday,  the waiter gave us both a piece of pie of our choice on the house.  If your looking for a Cajun restaraunt, with a new orleans feel, please go to Cajun Queen you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice location, complimentary valet, awesome service AND there's typically a Groupon; $25 for $40 worth of food...what more can you ask for ?!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. Had not been here for many years but it seems to get better with age. It is the best Cajun food I have ever and outside of New Orleans. We had the gumbo and étouffée and Both were outstanding. Service was also top notch."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Certainly not a creole expert, but felt very authentic.  Certainly beats any others Cajun places in Charlotte. 

Service was friendly, was in a cute little Elizabeth house. 

Only complaint was the seating was tight. Put four tables where three should have gone. 

Overall, I would go back and recommend it to a friend!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I ever been here before, it was so good. My family has been here Numerous times but for some reason I've never been. We started out with fried pickles and crawfish scampi. It was to die for.. then we all got different main course I have the special salmon with a crawfish, artichoke heart and sun-dried tomato sauce over rice. It was the best thing I've ever had. Most of my family got fried shrimp and oysters, they loved it. We ended with three desserts cheesecake , bread pudding and key lime pie, all were delicious. I'll definitely be back. This place really is that good! We had awesome customer service! There was nothing wrong with this meal."}
{"text":"Second time was amazing!!! Diane is the best i ever had. Don't forget to start with the bbq shrimp"}
{"text":"I went here for NYE dinner. The atmosphere is super cozy being in a old house. I split the Diane w/chicken, crawfish and shrimp with my boyfriend, and it took about 10 minutes to come out after we ordered it. The dish was really yummy. I'm not a huge cajun fan, but if this is how traditional cajun is done, then I'd say it's growing on me. 

All in all, our experience was great! The nightly jazz band was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I consider Cajun Queen one of Charlotte's original gems. I have been coming here for years and they have never disappointed me. This is definitely your place if you feel the New Orleans' Blues. 

The BBQ shrimp appetizer is a great way to start. The sauce is so good and with the perfect kick. 
My favorite was absolutely the Blackened Mahi Mahi served over rice from the special menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a ton of times and am just now reviewing it, shame on me! It's usually pretty easy to get a table without a reservation. I would recommend getting the groupon or living social deal ($20 for $40). 

Service: Can be slow to nonexistent at times. I almost always find myself searching for the wait staff. This is especially true if you're seated upstairs. Takes forever to get your check. 

Ambiance: The restaurant is in an old 2 story house. Tables are really tight. The \"booths\" are even tighter.  Lots of nice photography from Nola on the walls. A huge porch style dining area off the back. Live band upstairs. About upstairs....seating is sardines in a can. The tables are almost touching along the window. Upstairs is usually very loud. I'm sitting here listening to a woman scream over the music about how many times a day she pumps to feed her baby.  Along with a guy making jokes about his penis....sigh! The bar is also upstairs  FYI. 

Food: Great food. It makes up for the loud people and so so service.  My go to is the diane, a mushroom based dish with either chicken, shrimp, crawfish or all three.  Because I'm difficult I get it with blackened chicken and crawfish over mashed potatoes rather than white rice. My other faves are the fried catfish and the bbq shrimp. Too dang good! They also makea decent hurricane.  I've heard Sunday brunch is good, haven't been yet though.

They also offer complimentary valet on the side street next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome etouffee.  It actually isn't as spicy as I thought it'd be.  I got the shrimp, chicken, and crawfish combo.  Actually wish i didn't get the chicken (even though it was super tender), I just didn't get as much rice...which probably would have been really good with the sauces.  Other than that....pretty cool music by local musicians....great ambiance and good times.  =)

If work sends me back out here again, I wouldn't mind coming back..."}
{"text":"Celebration dinner for my niece...wedding dress shopping was successful that day.  The drinks were great...the food was amazing..."}
{"text":"Average gumbo. Our main meal was better. Very rushed service. Basically, one meal out before we'd put down our spoons on the last. Staff friendly enough. But very rushed. We were done in less than 45 mins with 3 courses. Probably won't go back as if I want fast food - I can get it and for a lot less cost."}
{"text":"It never fails that every time we come to Cajun Queen we leave extremely satisfied! I recommend sitting upstairs to hear the jazz band but their rooftop patio is super nice as well! Try the Diane chicken and add andouille sausage to it! You will devour the whole plate!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, I really love Cajun food and travel often to New Orleans, maybe I'm too spoiled by that.
I expected a more authentic experience.
Nice ambient."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based on a recommendation from my roommate. We went for food week so were presented with a three course menu and wine pairings for a good price. The gumbo starter was good but not amazing. The second course was a salmon in white wine sauce and the salmon absolutely perfect. It was a very generous piece of fish and somehow it was perfectly cooked all the way through. The third course was a key lime pie and was a nice finish to a delicious meal. The atmosphere was excellent and the wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely be bringing family here when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! Fantastic Service!  The food was one of the best we've had in Charlotte!  The spices, heat and flavors were great and finished by homemade dessert was the best finish."}
{"text":"Elizabeth is one of my favorite parts of town; I love how old houses have been remade into restaurants and offices.  Too often charming old buildings are paved over and replaces with concrete boxes.  The Cajun Queen is in one of these old homes, and this lends it a very intimate and warm atmosphere.

Of course, atmosphere isn't everything when it comes to restaurants, but the food at the Cajun Queen was fortunately spot-on as well.  Our tables started with the fried oyster appetizer, and it was a hit: emarkably light for a fried dish, it was like eating little oyster clouds.  For my main course, I ordered etouffee with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish).  It was creamy and deeply, darkly spicy.  I was a little worried about the protein aspect, since those three items have different cooking times, but all were perfectly done.

The Cajun Queen provided us with a delicious dinner.  I knock a single star off only because the service, while not bad, wasn't great either.  The place isn't exactly cheap, so our waiter earned a nice tip.  He could've paid just slightly more attention to our table.  Oh well, everyone has an off day."}
{"text":"Beautiful old house.  Classic and well presented NOLA type favorites.  Great drinks.  Do not miss the music upstairs and the deck.  Made the trip a vacation."}
{"text":"I decided to take my guy Mark out since he works way too much and he needed a night out.  The Cajun Queen did not disappoint.  Our waiter Bob was very friendly.  We started the evening with a bowl of seafood gumbo and a side of andouille sausage.  The gumbo was delicious and the andouille was grilled to perfection.  Mark ordered the crawfish etouffee and I ordered the blackened shrimp 'n grits.  Both dishes were amazing and paired well with our Legion beer.  Well done Cajun Queen, well done!"}
{"text":"Awesome Bbq shrimp appetizer! Shrimp and grits with sausage was ol so good! Coming from new Orleans this restaurant was great with a flavor of a nice jazz performance from the 7th street gator band!"}
{"text":"If your in Charlotte definitely make your way to Cajun Queen, highly recommend making a reservation you will be seated quickly and highly recommend using there complimentary valet parking you just have to tip the guys, great New Orleans Cajun/creole style food in Charlotte, their Sunday brunch is awesome as well!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't really care too much for the food. The wait was long for overpriced, bland, food."}
{"text":"Service: Our server was nice enough - nothing amazing, but was attentive and we never found ourselves lacking for anything.

Atmosphere: While I felt it's a little run-down on the inside, it didn't bother me on a cold, winter day because it was warm and inviting. There is a fireplace in the front room that I wish we could have been seated near. Instead, we were seated in a back room that felt like an enclosed patio that had parking lot lights streaming in. Oh well. Live music upstairs would have been too loud for our group to sit near it and talk. Valet parkers were friendly and quick.

Beverages: Thumbs-up for some fun beverages. I had the good ol' Hurricane (didn't seem too strong to me) and a fellow diner had the \"Seventh Street Stumbler.\" Both of us enjoyed our drinks. While I don't usually order those types of beverages, it seemed appropriate at a cajun restaurant and I was pleased.

Food: I don't know about everyone else, but I was blown away by my Shrimp Julienne (?) - it was light, but plenty of food and DELICIOUS. I would highly recommend to others and would order it again myself. The bread is a waste of carbohydrates, so ask them to skip that. The fried pickles were pretty delicious and I don't usually like fried pickles.

Overall: I would return here on a date or with friends who were ready to have some drinks."}
{"text":"We took our daughter there for her birthday a while ago, per her request.  We had a good group with us, but unfortunately they sat us upstairs right next to the band, which made it very difficult for conversation among all of us.  We've eaten our way through New Orleans a couple of times, but this, to me, was not quite up to par.  Especially at $15-$20 a plate.  I've been here twice, and unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back.  Fun atmosphere, great service, and yes, it would be a good date night.  But not a good group night."}
{"text":"We had heard a lot about this place and decided to dine in here during the Charlotte Restaurant Week. We have been to this place only once so far. Just to be safe we made reservations. I will say this place has a beautiful ambiance. It looks like a house which is converted to a beautiful restaurant. There is valet parking available. The receptionist at the front gave us a nice seat on the second floor. It was just our luck because there was live jazz music being played that night. During the restaurant week, this place does have a very good choice of Entrees. You will be served with a 3 course meal with the addition of a glass wine of your choice. We had the cup of seafood gumbo to begin with. The soup served was the right quantity. Not too much or too less. Soup was warm enough. The contained scallops, shrimp, vegetables. For the entree, we had Diane with Chicken and Fresh Fish (blackened Tilapia). Both the chicken as well as fish we cooked well. The topping on the fresh fish were great. The diane chicken had a variety of vegetables on it along with rice. You can also have shrimp and chicken together in it. The food was warm. The third and final course is a dessert of your choice. We chose to have the Key Lime Pie. I cant remember much but I don't think a Key Lime Pie can go wrong at all. The server was definitely very polite and nice to us. She was checking on us at regular intervals and the food was served in a timely manner. During restaurant week, I would say the price of the meal is $$. However if you decided to go some other time, then it would be $$$. The restrooms were clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was just an off night but we had a rough dining experience last night. We called and made a reservation for 8:45pm and were told this would be plenty of time to dine before their closing time of 10pm. As soon as we sat down we were rushed to order because the kitchen was closing at 9:15. Our plates were cleared before we were even able to finish our meals and when we told the waiter he replied with, \"I already put the dishes in the kitchen but I can bring them back out.\" The staff was turning off lights and locking up before we even got up to leave. We felt like we were intruding on the staff and an inconvenience so this made it difficult to enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here a few weeks ago with our friends who love the place! The hurricanes were on point! My wife had a special with fish and a shrimp sauce on top, and she really enjoyed it. I had the bayou platter and the catfish AND chicken were both cooked to perfection! The intimacy atmosphere can feel a little overly formal or stuffy when you first sit down, but see right past it and get yourself a hurricane, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night for the first time.  I ordered the Bayou Platter it was amazing.  I will definitely go back for the good and the jazz."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7pm on Friday  for our reservation and was seated immediately.  We were seated upstairs where the jazz band plays.  The music was good but was extremely loud because it's a small area.  It was very hard to have a conversation with my husband without yelling and/or repeating myself.  The food was good not great.  The Cajun Popcorn was a good appetizer, but next time I would ask for the sauce on the side (some pieces were drenched).  We both had the blackened catfish with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I added the extra topping of Diane sauce.  The catfish had very good flavor and we received two nice sized pieces.  We each only had 2-3 small pieces of broccoli with thick stalks and they could have been steamed maybe a minute or two longer.  

I had read previous reviews about parking, so we used the valet service.  When it was time to leave, the attendants seemed overwhelmed.  After waiting about 5 minutes, we decided to get our own car....the attendant just handed us the keys, no apologies or anything.  When we got to the car, the drivers side window was down.  Luckily, it was a very light drizzle of rain that evening and nothing valuable was in the car! 

Overall,  very festive atmosphere, food was good, and wait service was good.  We were never without water or tea. It got extremely crowded  around 7:45 so we recommend reservations.  The Valet Service was disappointing.  The guys need to be trained on basic customer service.  Get a Groupon if possible."}
{"text":"Brunch with the family. It was great! Spicy Tassos biscuits, an omelet and shrimp and grits. All shared and all delicious! Service is friendly, fast and suoer-clean. One of our favorite places. The back porch is right and inviting."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Blackened fish of any variety is great tasting I had the mahi-mahi. Very authentic and NOLA like atmosphere. Only negative is no beignets at dinner only during the brunch."}
{"text":"We visited Cajun Queen for the second time tonight & I'm updating my review from 4 to 5 stars. The upgrade is largely due to the fact that this time we sat upstairs & enjoyed some great live jazz! Also, my husband got the same dish as last time (crawfish & shrimp étouffée) & called it one of his \"favorite dishes ever\" & I tried something new (shrimp creole) & loved it just as much as the dish I got the first time (shrimp Diane). The walls are adorned with great photos of NOLA, the home where the restaurant lives is beautiful, & the service is good. The free valet is a nice touch as street parking in at a premium in the neighborhood. Check out Cajun Queen!"}
{"text":"The food has gone BLAND! I've always enjoyed Cajun Queen for the food, atmosphere and service. This time the food just didn't cut it. My 3 way etoufee had the heat but lacked flavor as did my New Orleans BBQ shrimp appetizer which looked considerably small for the large portion I ordered. My cajun martini was a bad choice as it was not chilled enough and too hot to enjoy. I'll chalk that up as my fault for trying something different. I think I'll wait awhile before returning here."}
{"text":"We are so lucky to have this place in Charlotte!! It is by far one of my favorite restaurants in town (more of a special occasion place for us.) Listen up, they give you a basket of bread but DO NOT immediately dive into it!! Order the barbecue shrimp for an appetizer which has all of this delicious sauce that you must then DIP the bread into. Do it, you will thank me. Everything I've had is fabulous but we always end up going to the \"Diane\" style with chicken, shrimp and crawfish. The flavors cannot be beat. I have never been to New Orleans, but people I know who have been many times says this is even better than some restaurants in NO, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Cajun menu with great apps. Can't go wrong with the etouffee or shrimp and grits. The live music is 10/10. Great place to take someone while they're visiting Charlotte. It's been around for forever. Reservations and valet parking will make life easier when dining here."}
{"text":"\"A very flavorful New Orleans' experience without burning your tongue\"
The restaurant is an old house in a very nice area of town an area called Elizabeth. Open every night for dinner, and they have a Live Jazz band every night.
Tried the Abita Beers (Amber, and Fruity) both good. In the second floor of the house is the bar, and in a room next to it is the Jazz Band. Nice art in the walls that is for sale without price meaning - if you have to ask you can not afford it. For appetizers we tried the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp (4.5) - the right amount of spiciness, with layers of flavor. You will want to use the bread to soak all that wonderful juiciness. We also ordered the Craw-fish Scampi (3), it was lemony and not as complex as the shrimp. The Blackened new York steak was nice but uneventful (3)  the Mahi-Mahi with Diane sauce on top of mashed potatoes (4)was very good. I tried the special of the day - Pan Seared Duck Breast ( medium) on top of garlic fried potatoes w Craw-fish Etouffe (4.5) really nice combination. It had the best flavors of Cajun/Creole cuisine but it was not spicy or heavy. The only weak note was the Seafood Gumbo (2.5) it was just OK a bit bland, I added some drops of the hot sauce and it was better.  In conclusion, it was a very nice experience and definitely a high end New Orleans experience.  They do not offer espresso =(. But the Bourbon Bread Pudding hit a perfect mark, it was unexpected light and fluffy, not too sweet. We also had a very good Pecan Pie (3.5)."}
{"text":"When I found out we were going here for brunch while I was in town, I was excited.  I had not had beignets since I was in Nola in April and I was craving them.  When we arrived at 10 to 11 (brunch begins at 11), there was already a line of people waiting outside.  The doors opened and people walked in like they had not ate in years, we knew we were in for a treat.  The restaurant is within what appears to be a house.  The dining rooms are where a living room and a den would typically be.  We were seated by the fireplace, which was running since it was 45 degrees outside.  The decor is very quaint and welcoming, almost like you're visiting a relative's house.

The dinner menu is also available all day but you truly go to this place for brunch.  I originally asked for a coffee with amaretto but they don't serve alcohol before noon (I'm spoiled from NY brunches) but their regular coffee was just as good.  We started off with an order of beignets.  6 perfectly sized fried balls of dough were presented with the most delicious strawberry compote in the middle for dipping.  The beignets were perfect and light and that compote made my day.  

For our entrees, we each got something different and decided to pick and choose from the other plates.  I got the bacon, egg, and cheese omelet.  This omelet was thick with a whole layer of bacon going through the center.  It also came with a side of cheesy grits, which were also delicious, and fresh fruit.  My friend got the bananas foster French toast.  The bananas were sweet but good and the toast itself was fluffy and delicious.  My other friend got the rice and beans, which yes becomes an entire meal since sausage is also included.  These were some of the best rice and beans the three of us have ever tasted.  And this is coming from a Puerto Rican, who also confirmed their tastiness.

Overall, this is a fantastic place for brunch.  Get there early, and try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"In no way do I feel like I'm a New Orleans style food expert, but I have been to a few restaurants in the past with similar style food, and I have to say, Cajun Queen is pretty much amazing!

I bought a Groupon for this place on a whim- and it was about to expire so I rounded up a friend and headed over there to treat him for a night out.  

I have a favorite meal from a restaurant at home that they call Louisiana Shrimp and Scallops- and it is JUST like the \"Diane.\"  The sauce that it is in is DELICIOUS!  A little bit of kick, I asked for it extra spicy.  I had it with all three proteins- chicken, shrimp and crawfish.  It was excellent!!!  I can't wait to go back and get it again.

My friend got blackened Cat fish.  It was good.....pretty similar to most blackened food....not exactly signature like I would compare my dish to!  His meal came with a salad or soup, mine did not.

They started our meal with rolls and butter.....I wish I got to try the bread and oil dip that I saw a few other people wrote about!

THe price point was close to $20 per person.  I do believe it's priced parallel to the meal, but I would save it for a slighty more special occasion.  I did not get to see a lot of the building- we were seated downstairs to the right in a section that was a bit less intimate and was kind of patio-like.  The other dining area downstairs did look a bit fancier and we never went upstairs, which sounded like it was the bar area.

All in all, it was a great meal and great spot!"}
{"text":"Host sat us right next to drums so we couldn't hear to have conversation. Waited without getting acknowledged by a server for about 15 min before walking back downstairs to tell host we needed to sit elsewhere. Fernando wasn't a bad waitor, just didn't smile or give us silverware and napkins until we asked for them after our apps had arrived so he wasn't great either. Drinks were completely empty before refilled. Shrimp app was okay, gumbo was not so yummy. Fried pickles were good, Mahi special was really good, Diane was good and will be good as a leftover. Valet was nice and definitely needed with location we were likely to not find parking on our own."}
{"text":"My husband and I always have a good time, good meals, and good drinks when we go to the Cajun Queen!  Love the Jazz and make sure we sit near the stage!  Just celebrated my birthday there in January...superb meal and service!  Yay!"}
{"text":"I agree with Lindsey R. that this area of 7th Street has some of Charlotte's cutest restaurants. Fig Tree, Jackelope's, and a few others along this way are all located in re-vamped houses, and it makes the dining experience much more intimate and exciting. 

I usually go for the red beans and rice and the fried green tomatoes appetizer, as there's not a lot in the way of veggie-friendly food...but I'm ok with what I get, as it's really, really good. 

And, since I don't eat too heavy on the entree part of the meal, I have room for the key lime pie. The key lime pie is worth the trip by itself. It's just the right tangy and just the right sweet. It's incredible."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always order the blackened catfish with the shrimp topping in sauce. Stupendous!!! The Oreo cheesecake is mouth watering goodness!! I especially like sitting upstairs near the band after 6 pm!! My 4 year old needs entertainment at restaurants and he loves it!!"}
{"text":"WOW - NOLA in CLT. This was a great choice for dinner on a Saturday night. We tried to get a reservation through the website but there was no availability. We decided to ride over and take our chances because the menu was so tempting. We did alright. We opted for bar seating to get service sooner rather than later (40 minute wait).  We ordered fried green tomato appetizer, an appetizer shrimp fried instead of BBQ style to go along with the chicken Etouffee, the Wash Day Blues (red beans and rice with andouille sausage) and we finished up with the bourbon Bread pudding. Every morsel that touched our mouths was delicious. The fried green tomatoes cooked perfect, nice crunchy flavorful coating and gently firm inside. The tomato remoulade had just enough flavor to not over power the breading. The fried shrimp were perfectly seasoned no need for the Cajun tartar sauce that Bo promised but never delivered to my sister. The Etouffee with chicken was New Orleans spicy and hit the spot. The chicken was tender enough to break with a fork. The portions were huge. There were two large chicken breasts in the Etouffee. The Wash Day Blues was a large bowl of Red beans and rice with 4 half andouille sausages. The flavor was authentic and not over spicy. I only wished that I had cornbread instead of the sour dough roll. Although, the roll was really good as well. Did I mention, we were sitting at the bar.  We were glad that Bo came over to take care of us. He did a FANTASTIC job! I will not to mention delicious bourbon bread pudding. We were lucky enough to get a piece fresh out of the oven, the peaches and raisin with the caramel sauce just made my taste buds SING!!!. I will definitely go back to the Cajun Queen and I recommend it to anyone in the city and craving some authentic NOLA fair."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this out on a whim based on reviews from Yelp and it was very tasty! I feel like the quality of food and the presentation, don't quite match the prices that they are charging, but they had a great crowd and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves! I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Everytime we drive down 7th Street and I see that Crocodile standing in front of Cajun Queen felt I had to go.  I love a good jazz place!!  Well finally after 10 years in Charlotte and thanks to a Groupon we finally went to Cajun Queen on a Saturday night, at 5:00 pm mind you.  Not even the dinner crowd, but the senior crowd.

We arrive before 5:00 only to be confused with the parking lot.  Directly behind the Cajun Queen there must be MAYBE 8 spots and next to the Cajun Queen is a hair salon with an empty parking lot that doesn't want to allow people to park there while they are clearly closed...ahem, I digress.  The Cajun Queen valet did run over to us before we sealed our fate with the eternal fate of a parking boot (I think the hair dresser has a camera watching from a remote area...just saying).  We ending up parking across the street.  Not too bad, luckily there wasn't heavy traffic because my slow poke kid was with us.
It was super crowded, even at 5:00 pm.  Luckily we made a reservation.  

They seated us upstairs which I thought :WOW !!That's neat, it's going to lovely up there.\"  Well, not so much.  There are too many tables for too small of a space.  I was butt up against the buffett where the servers were clearly trying to maneuver around me to get their extra plates, water, etc. I think if they would get rid of 3 or 4 tables it would have been a better atmosphere.  The servers were always trying their best to get around the crowded room. The tables are small and wobbly.  Just for a joint like this, I expect better. 

Being such a small place it was extra noisey, not from the jazz band, but just from people laughing extra hard, or talking super loud, or what have you.  No close intimate dinners for you!

Our poor server was a bit slow on getting our order and taking care of us.  I just think Cajun Queen tries to do too much with too little.  

On to the food!  Well after several minutes of \"I don't like anything and I don't want shrimp\", our pickiest of eaters chose mashed potatoes and sausage (two sides) as his meal.  Guess what folks?  He actually liked it and ate half of it.  He was trying to convince us of getting a 16 ounce steak. We laughed at that one...well my husband and I anyway, picky eater was convinced he could eat a whole steak.  HHAHAHA.  I had the gumbo and house salad, my husband and other kid had shrimp diane.  All which were pretty darn good.   

The jazz band came after we had dessert.  They were cute and not too loud which amazed me because we were one table away from the stage.  So meh, we won't be back.  For a family of four it came to around $80.00 including 2 sodas, and 2 desserts, but not including the Groupon."}
{"text":"The food was underwhelming and predominately salty. The service was pushy. We were served bread before we had any silverware. As soon as my girlfriend received her entree a bus-boy came and asked if she was finished (no joke). I still hadn't received my entree and when it finally arrived I was served the Chicken Diane (I had ordered the etoufee). They quickly corrected it. However, without the Groupon this restaurant's service and quality do not match up to the price on the menu. Additionally, there was no live music (which is mentioned as a drawing card in most reviews). We visited on a Saturday night at 9pm."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and great place for family dinner. Weekends are very busy for them so we don't plan dinners there on weekends."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pork chop is to die for when cooked properly. I've only had one unsatisfactory chop. I got the blackened chicken caesar salad (on a better eating program) and there was so much chicken I had to bring it home. The chicken was absolutely delish, well seasoned and moist. I always get the bread pudding, regardless...another delish...yum!!!

The band is cute, 3 mature gentlemen and they have a new singer. I always sit upstairs. The band starts at 7:30."}
{"text":"Great meal with live jazz. Had the Mahi with a topping of garlic, butter, artichoke, and Crawfish...wife had the creole pasta. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"These guys need to be open more. The food was good and our waiter was nice. Plan to park a block away and walk."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was great! I ordered the BBQ shrimp and Cajun Pasta. I used my living social coupon because I like to save."}
{"text":"Step into a little bit of the Cajun lifestyle at the queen! Went for a friends birthday and they were able to accommodate 12 of us decently. There is definitely an old school charm to the restaurant, probably because it's inside a retrofitted house.

They have a surprisingly extensive booze menu. Didn't try the cocktails but they looked good coming out. You have to get the traditional étouffée... Shrimp or crawfish. It's the right amount of spice and heat to go along your heaping pile of rice. The surprise of the night was the bourbon bread pudding, warm and delicious.

Service was good. No complaints and everything came out as expected."}
{"text":"They Lack favor in their food. I ordered the gumbo it lacked favor and good ingredients. it was not good. The popcorn crawfish were so delicious but covered in a mayo based sauce that should be served on the side. I didn't like seeing the stations for busing dishes right as you got to the top of stairs. It has potential but think the chef needs to take a hard look at his food. 

I want to love this place but the food is not executed well at this time."}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is pretty much always good. What's not to like about Cajun food? All of the classics are here. The restaurant is located right in the Elizabeth area in a converted house. There are lots of fun legends about the house being haunted. I know they also do live jazz, though I'm unsure of what night. Regardless, you may want to make a reservation before visiting. It's always busy.

Last night, we ordered fried green tomatoes, fried oysters, Cajun pasta, and the steak special. (It was a make-up Father's Day dinner.) All were fabulous. The oysters and the pasta were my favorites and the tomatoes were my least - though, still decent. My only gripe is that it is a little over priced. The portions are large and the quality is good so it's probably justified. 

Parking blows."}
{"text":"This place is great. It looks small on the outside but it's gigantic on the inside. Very quaint and reminiscent of an abode in the French quarter. I had the popcorn crawfish and the red beans and rice here. Both dishes were awesome. The pop corn crawfish was meaty and had a slight hint of spice to it not salty or anything. Let's not talk about the sweet tea. That was just marvelous. Not too sweet. It was just right."}
{"text":"Always love this place.  I've eaten here for at least 18 years, and never have never written about the awesome food and service.  Hubby and I went to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary.  We arrived at 6:30 and was seated immediately.  I had a key lime martini, which was delicious!  We shared the BBQ shrimp,  a little spicy for me but I love the flavors.  Hubby had the blackened Mahi with crawfish artichoke topping.  I ordered blackened pork tenderloin.  Somehow my order was messed up and the server brought out pork chop.  It looked so delicious, I told him I would take it.  Not a bad choice at all.  The gravy was to die for.  The only thing missing were the plantains that came with the tenderloin, which our server brought out, on the house. Did I mention the service is grea.t here?  The portions are generous; easily two meals.  We were stuffed but still got the bread pudding to go. I have always had a great experience, delicious food and excellent service at this place."}
{"text":"We always love this place it is always spot on and the cajun/creole tastes are true to the origin. Shrimp app is incredible, we really have not every had anything bad here. I recommend you try this place even if you are not a cajun fan."}
{"text":"SUCH good food! Traditional Cajun, so rich and flavorful!  Also the bananas foster french toast for brunch is one of my boyfriends favorite dishes he has ever had!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I've been to New Orleans or have friends from Louisiana but I don't know what the big to do about Cajun Queen is.  Maybe it's because people have never had real Cajun cuisine before.

The fried green tomatoes were blah.  The batter wasn't tasty at all.  My entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp, chicken and crawfish.  The seasoning was weak.  I must say that the shrimp and chicken were cooked really well.  I just didn't expect a whole chicken breast to be laid over my plate.  The portions were good.

Neither one of my two friends finished their plates.  One said her shrimp and grits were just okay.  My other friend said her fried oysters were fresh.

I will not be going back.  Parking was hard to find and it was loud inside."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but the seating could be more comfortable to a point of wanting to hang out for a bit to listen to music and have some drinks. Wait staff are very nice a knowledgable about the menu. Highly recommend the \"Shrimp and Crawfish\" app to start and \"7th St. Stumbler\" as you drink. Do the complimentary valet parking sons not to have parking issues."}
{"text":"I came to Cajun Queen on a whim Friday evening to try their restaurant week servings. Of course we didn't have reservations, but luckily were able to sit right away after grabbing two stools in their bar area upstairs. It turned out to be a great little spot overlooking the valet area so there were plenty of people watching opportunities :)

I got the 4 course pre fixe - glass of chardonnay, cup of gumbo, crawfish etouffee, and bread pudding - for $30. For the quantity and quality of food, I was impressed. The only thing I didn't like of my meal was the chardonnay - but I almost consider that a freebie since most restaurant week menus don't include alcohol. 

I really liked that both the gumbo and etouffee were spicy and flavorful, but not drowning in salt. I love cajun food, and really appreciated that Cajun Queen could satisfy the Bayou flavor and seasonings without being overly buttery or overly salty (think Zatarain's).

While we were there, a live jazz band was playing downstairs. Great spot for date night."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with fantastic food, seriously loved the sevice, the ambiance and especially the dishes. Its a nice setting too.

I had the shrimp and the ettouffe, and I will seriously visit this place everytime i'm in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Well well well. I hate to be a negative Nancy here but the food has seriously declined in every aspect since last year when it was fairly good. Once upon a time it was decent.

My group had crawfish Ettoufee, fried green tomatos, seafood gumbo, crawfish tails with sherry remoulade, barbecue shrimp. 

My Ettoufee was very old. There was no attempt on presentation whatsoever as they usually did, and it was served it a different bowl. It was literally slopped over loke a pig trough. I didn't eat it.

The gumbo was very soupy, and tasted like instant tomato soup; not reminiscent of any authentic new Orleans version in any way whatsoever.

Fried green tomatoes were good.
BBQ shrimp were fine.

I'm not sure, at this point, if they can ever get it together again. They're so far off the deep end now that I have officially given up. I'll never return again. 

Good luck to you if you decide to book a reservation based on the positive reviews, you're going to need it."}
{"text":"LOVE the Etouffee! The chicken with rice and beans is amazing. I can't wait to go back. I love the casual feel and the food is just down right good."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place, great vibe, amazing food! Huge portions, the leftovers were an entirely new meal! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent! We loved the ambiance and the live band was a bonus. Husband ordered the shrimp and grits, only complaint was the shrimp were a little tough. I had the chicken Diane. It was wonderfully flavored without too much spice. We loved the BBQ shrimp appetizer! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here in the upstairs dining room near the live band.  The food was excellent and the portions were generous/filling.  The BBQ shrimp appetizer is tremendous.  An excellent way to start your meal.  

The food is prepared well and in a timely manner.  I had blackened catfish with veggies (very well prepared and large portion) and thought it was phenomenal.  I thought the gumbo could be a bit better, but overall, the meal was really good.

Service was solid as well.  Can be tough to converse if you dine in the room with the band...they are really good but, as expected, it is pretty loud.  Overall a very good place to have a meal."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in Charlotte so far. I got shrimp and grits and my boyfriend got the French toast. Best shrimp and grits I've ever had and he literally said \"if I'm on death row, this would be my last meal\" about the French toast. Go here!"}
{"text":"Fabulous  restaurant...the food is amazing. The mahi mahi special excellent restaurant we go down here every year when we go to North Carolina to visit family"}
{"text":"So GOOD! My boss is from Charlotte and he told me I had to come here on my vacation. I did and I loved it! I ordered the Diane with everything and omg it was spectacular... 

The bartenders and waitresses were very friendly and resourceful although the hostess needs to check her attitude. either way, I didn't mind because I'm still daydreaming about that food! Nom city!"}
{"text":"There were 10 of us here for a work dinner on a Wednesday night. The place wasn't too crowded but our table was right in front of the band upstairs and I was a little worried it was going to be crazy loud. Luckily it ended up being the best spot we could've gotten.

The table started with fried oysters and fried crawfish which you aren't going to go wrong with.  I ordered the ribeye and broccoli with a cup of gumbo. I wasn't crazy about the gumbo, and I thought it was a little thin and lacked any substance. Everyone else seemed to like it though. My ribeye was cooked and seasoned very well though with all that fried food in the beginning I couldn't finish it all. Two guys ordered some bread pudding for dessert and I tried some and it was awesome.

As for the music, they would play a few songs and then take a break so we could have conversations if we wanted. We had some Portuguese guys with us and someone asked them to play some Portuguese songs which apparently they did. You could tell the guy on the keyboards knew what he was doing and seemed to enter another world when he started playing. Overall it was a fun night with good food and everyone there seemed to enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"So about 10 years ago I was taken to Cajun Queen by some friends when I moved here to Charlotte from Chicago. Remembering that I was not crazy about it, I still was open to going again to re try it. I searched through all the Yelp reviews to see what to order and what was the best. 
First...this old House or Restaurant should be updated..obviously with the amount of people in it  at the time I left...they have the money. Stair case is wiggley..and it is just plain old..Not quaint and old ..just old.
We were a big party and we had a good server named IVY, but the food left lots to be desired. We were kindly treated by our hosts to almost ever single one of the appetizers to begin with. This started with Fried Oysters that were for sure fried a couple of days ago and then reheated in a microwave! ..Fried Green tomatoes were straight out of frozen bag and not fried..just barely baked..still cold in the middle..very bland. The New Orleans style Barbequed Shrimp....tiny little salad size and in the same sauce that everything including the gumbo had. 
I am going to spare you anymore..but to tell you It will for sure be another 10 years before I go back...thank goodness the company was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place in a historic home in Elizabeth.  We loved the appetizers and atmosphere (five stars for those), but found the entrees pulled down our overall rating.  The spicy shrimp app and fried oysters app were awesome!!  The shrimp app was super spicy and full-of-flavor...save some bread to sop up the sauce!!  The oyster app was perfectly fried and came with a delicious dipping sauce.  We ordered the fried oyster entree (which was overcooked) and chicken, shrimp, and crawfish etoufee (which lacked salt and spices).  For dessert we enjoyed a slice of key lime pie (not as tart as we like but also not too sweet).  You can enjoy live music upstairs in the bar area or sit downstairs for a quieter meal.  This place is definitely worth a visit, especially if you're looking to share some yummy appetizers!"}
{"text":"Evening was great!!!! Food was delicious!! Live music!!! Atmosphere for great conversations!!! And a shout out to the bartender Harrison who took such great care of us!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!   Service was great!  Table was too small for a party of four; at best, two customers."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a dinner date with the girlfriend a few days ago.  I was tasked with picking a place we haven't tried and this place came to mind.  In addition to that I actually had a coupon which actually sweetened the deal even more.

We got there and headed upstairs to the bar to give our appetites a chance to ramp up.  The bar is small but doable and the furnishings are a little dated looking.  Not sure if that's the look they are going for but it is what it is.  Not horrible, just not as fancy as one might expect.

We then were seated outside and I actually preferred the outdoor seating.  It's on a low roof area so it's kind of nice with the view.  The food came out and it was fine, nothing I would shout about but also not terrible. 

I think the issue is I just don't think the dollars to dishes ratio is in tact here.  Things just seemed a bit too pricey for what you got.  I'd come back but not without that coupon."}
{"text":"The lady bartender, i think her name starts with an M is truly an angel. I watched her serve all 20+ people at her bar, and serve the waitstaff their drinks in a very timely manner. We ordered 4 courses + drinks and had no issues with time or food quality. It was completely packed and she kept her whole bar happy! I love her! Food was on point."}
{"text":"Great cajun creole. Lovely wait staff. My family and I are definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"I felt like I came to New Orlean's all of a sudden (except for fact that we could find parking pretty fast, not so in New Orleans, in fact, there is no parking there in French Quarter, but that's another story).

There is a bar on the upper level with New Orleans music playing while you wait for someone. Note that you will have to pay for drinks if you have any right there upstairs, can't put it on your meal bill. Just FYI.
Downstairs, there is a nice gas fireplace that keeps the place warm and cozy.

I was apprehensive at first because of the cuisine type, not a fan of spicy foods, however, the menu has got variety for every taste: seafood, steaks, pasta, grains, potatoes, soups, salads and even the fried green tomato. No kidding. It was actually pretty good, reminded me of fried eggplant. Unusual.

Portions are humongous! I don't usually leave food on my plate, however, here, it was just humanly impossible for me to finish the buttery blackened chicken over Aveoulle pasta. 

Solid four stars for bringing New Orleans to Charlotte. 

Take the Cajun Queen steam boat Mississippi tour when you are in New Orleans!"}
{"text":"Great food here.  Had fried crawfish appetizer and the crawfish were incredibly sweet.  Gumbo was spectacularly fresh tasting.  Portion was just right to accompany the meal.  I also had the New Orleans platter that consisted of fried catfish, oysters shrimp and scallops.  The seafood was so fresh and sweet tasting.  If you are looking for Cajun in Charlotte, you won't go wrong with Cajun Queen."}
{"text":"Was able to get a 9:00 pm reservation on short notice and was excited to try this restaurant! The band played in the other room but we were able to hear the music just fine. The server was very professional and the food was delicious. I recommend the 3 meat Diane, delectable! Would highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"This was a little taste of New Orleans in the Carolinas. The food was excellent and full of flavor. They have a live band on sunday morning for brunch which wad a nice little addition to the ambiance. It is a small restaurants that looks like it was a house. This adds to the down home feel and warmth of cajun food.

My friends and I had the Crawfish Scampi with grits, BBQ Shrimp, the gumbo and the blackened chicken. It was all very good, but the gumbo didn't have as much flavor as the other dishes.

I DEFINITELY plan to go back again!"}
{"text":"The food & service was amazing! The waiter was very helpful. The food came out quick & was properly cook. Definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This quaint spot is a MUST if you are in Charlotte. Excellent food, great service and nice entertainment."}
{"text":"Found this place via Groupon and I am glad I did. Great food, great service, and a live jazz band. We had the Cajun popcorn, BBQ shrimp, seafood gumbo and shrimp and grits. All excellent! If you happen to be in Charlotte as we were then check them out they will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Mmmm-mmm! I definitely picked the right place for my birthday dinner. We showed up slightly early and got to mingle in the bar for a few minutes- what a fun bar! I'm going to have to go back just for that alone. Then we were seated in the downstairs porch/sun room, or as my grandmother would say, \"on the veranda.\"

We had some trouble communicating with our server- one guest was late, and I think he was waiting on her to get there before we ordered drinks, but I can't hold that against him as he was just triple-sat. Next time I'll be clearer- alcohol now!

They have a great drink selection, including creatively-named specialty cocktails. I was tempted to order the \"Seventh Street Stumbler\" and see if it held up to it's name, but in the end, a glass (um, or three) of white wine went well with my dinner.

The food was out of this world! We had the fried green tomato appetizer and devoured it. For entrees, I had the blackened salmon special with crawfish and artichokes, and my friends had the catfish, the chicken Diane, and the shrimp and grits, and we were all so busy making yummy noises no one could talk. I think we planned to try each others but they all disappeared so quickly we never got around to it. 

We were too stuffed for dessert but that bourbon bread pudding is calling my name for next time. And there will be a next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at cajun queen was very relaxed! Its also amazing how so many people can fit in an remodeled historic home. Great and intimate feel along with very good cajun cuisine equals a satisfying dinner or even a well planned out date night. Either way you can't lose"}
{"text":"Nightly live jazz music on the second floor, but you have to ask to be seated in that room. Food was good. The options we wanted to order all had a 1/2 portion, which was great as we could try more dishes! Ordered the Crawfish Scampi, etouffee, BBQ shrimp, wash day (rice, beans and andouille) and fried green tomatoes. Environment was happy, music was great, and food was delicious!

Recommend coming for a girls night out on the town type of evening!"}
{"text":"I love this place and can't wait to go back. The food was really good and reminded of my fave creole restaurant that closed down back home. Now that I've been, I know that I have found my replacement.  There was a jazz band playing upstairs that sounded really nica and added to the experience. The only thing I didn't really like was the parking and the dirty glasses. The wait staff did give us clean glasses, so it wasn't a problem for long."}
{"text":"I want to like Cajun Queen, because I love New Orleans and everything about it. I want to go somewhere and be reminded of the hospitality and the spectacular food of one of my favorite cities -- but Cajun Queen is not it.

I took my folks out for Sunday brunch. Our reservations were for 11am, which is right when they open. We got there a few minutes early and sat in the parking lot waiting for someone to open the door. As we walked in -- clearly the only patrons there -- we were walked through the quaint dining room with the fireplace and onto the enclosed back porch, all the way in the corner. The only people there, and they put us as far away as they could possibly put us. There was some sort of heating unit on and chugging over one of the windows. It buzzed and whined through our entire meal. Once someone turned on the music, it mostly obstructed the sound, but it came on so abruptly and loudly that the three of us jumped in our seats. 

The food was fine. My omelet was dry on the outside and undercooked on the inside. The andouille sausage inside my omelet was gray and sad looking, but the same sausage in my mother's shrimp and grits was brightly colored and appetizing. Did I get the leftovers? 

I've been with my parents a handful of times, and they're always pleased, but Cajun Queen just doesn't live up to my standards. The service, food, and prices are all acceptable, but I can't find anything about this restaurant that shines."}
{"text":"Went here because all the reviews are 4 stars and up but Yelp fooled me this time. Gumbo was tomato based and very acidic, not crazy about it. Etoufee had a nice roux but what ruined both of these was the SHRIMP! Farm raised, flavorless, they had the texture of a cheese puffs. The food would have been ten times better if they just used a little bit of fresh seafood. I tried my friends etoufee with chicken and I wish I had ordered that. I can't take a Cajun restaurant seriously that won't use  decent seafood products."}
{"text":"I only hear great reviews for this restaurant. So I knew it was time to go when I saw there was a Groupon. They offer free valet which makes it a lot easier since I had no clue where to park and they will tow your car if you  park else where. The manager immediately opens the door for us as we approach and we got seated right away. We did make reservations in advance though. I was shocked to see a live band playing on a Wednesday night but apparently they are there 7 days a week! I enjoyed the live music and fireplace that adds on the ambiance. Our server was okay, he gave us bread and provided enough time for us to look through our menu. We decided to go with the Etouffee and Diane. Both had chicken, shrimp and crawfish. I liked the Etouffee but man... I miss the Diane already. I've been starring hard at the Cajun Queen groupon again because I'm already carving for another dish. My boyfriend just recently told me they are $4 cheaper if you get the voucher on living social. You won't be disappointed if you're looking for a new restaurant to try in Charlotte. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The setting is wonderful-- the restaurant is in a nice, big colorful house and its filled with lots of vibrant paintings--one of the rooms even has a fireplace which adds a lot of character.  The food is also very solid--lots of New Orleans specialties served by a very friendly staff. I had the blackened catfish which was very good and came with some nice steamed broccoli and yummy mashed potatoes. I also tried the fried oysters and the gumbo which were also both very tasty. Also, another highlight was the bread which came warm and fresh.  Would definitely recommend this place for a Nawlins meal in a fun, warm setting."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great reviews about this restaurant. Sad to say it was only mediocre to me. I ordered the seafood gumbo bowl which taste as if it came out of a can, which was very unpleasant. My friend ordered the barbecue shrimp as an appetizer which I tasted and it was great!!! For my entree, I ordered the shrimp creole and I enjoyed it but it wasn't anything fantastic. I'm not sure if I would go back again but the scenery is nice and the waitstaff was very nice and engaging."}
{"text":"I mainly visit the bar at CQ and I can only come up with positive comments. Bo, the bartender, is great. He remembers my name and drink choices. That is very wonderful. I highly recommend either dining upstairs or taking out. Very fine."}
{"text":"Wow.. this place is incredible. Everything from the atmosphere, the service and the food. I've eaten at some real authentic places in New Orleans and Cajun Queen is right up there with some of them. This is the best Cajun restaurant in Charlotte. We ordered the BBQ shrimp, fried seafood platter and the etouffee. Highly recommend all three. We'll certainly be back"}
{"text":"Best Cajun that I have had outside New Orleans.  Service was fabulous,  Eat on the second floor for the smooth jazz."}
{"text":"The friendly staff was very professional and always attentive to our needs. Loved the very relaxed atmosphere. The food portions were amazing, you definitely will not leave hungry. The food was absolutely perfect. So much flavor......delicious!!! You must try the Bread Pudding for dessert. Complimentary Car Valet was a nice touch too."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place.  Best experience is sitting upstairs at the bar.  Order the NOLA BBQ Shrimp; Crawfish Etouffe; fish specials (seems like these never change, come to think of it....); blackened pork tenderloin with plantains and black bean mash.  PLUS live jazz every darn night.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The BEST, BEST little known secret place in Charlotte! The food is amazing. Please, please check them out. If necessary or unsure purchase a Groupon .. I promise you, YOU will NEVER be disappointed. The staff is friendly, professional and all around joyful. If you're coming to Charlotte, I'm taking you to Cajun Queen!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner and ate upstairs, enjoying the bar area first.  We popped outside with our drinks and ran into members of the house band. Had a wonderful time talking to the musicians.  The food was delicious, and the menu has  gluten free options too.   If  you want to enjoy the jazz, reserve a table upstairs, preferably when there isn't a wedding party. Really loved the music!"}
{"text":"The best fried oysters I've ever had(huge portion) on top of Caesar salad. Too much aioli on the fried green tomatoes but fried very well. Gumbo was tasty but nothing to brag about. The real star of the show is the oyster!"}
{"text":"No such thing as a bad meal here. A nice cozy place to grab some of the best New Orleans Cuisine in Charlotte. I had the Blackened Catfish covered in a shrimp based sauce with peppers and it was served over mashed potatoes and a side of steamed Broccoli. I could not even finish my meal. Washed it down with a local beer and slept like a baby afterwards. Our server was friendly and engaging but I would highly suggest reservations because they stay busy."}
{"text":"Service is good. Gumbo was a bit watery and a pinch of salt wouldn't have hurt. Gumbo was fresh. The same tomatoe soupy water they use in the gumbo they also add to my shrimp and grits. Shrimp and andoui sausage  was good but grits its self were under seasoned i.e pinch of salt."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and the food and service is always excellent. Many thanks to the management and staff. Exceptional entrees and apps. Only recommendation- which is minor, would be to change up the dessert selections"}
{"text":"My family goes here every year on my mom's birthday. Every time it's the same: excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere. Keep up the good work Cajun Queen!"}
{"text":"Went on the last day of Restaurant Week. I had been here once before but that was 21 years ago. Wow! They've been around a long time. I didn't realize how small this place is. All of the tables are quite close together. Didn't like that. Felt like I couldn't have a private conversation. Our server was good. But he seemed a bit rushed to me. The biggest complaint I had is that my food was not hot. I ordered the Cajun pasta dish and it came out lukewarm AND it wasn't very flavorful. My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits.  I have a $25 groupon I want to use (couldn't use during RW) so I'll be giving this place another try. Oh! Love the valet parking!"}
{"text":"We knew it would be crowded but never expected how loud it was. OSHA would have require hearing protection if it was called there. Absolutely out of controlled. Clear example of how to take a great restaurant with great food with large (even too large) servings and add it with a server who could care less, and you get a rotten time. Front of the house is a mess while the back of the house purrs. Do not ever, ever sit in the back right room with tile floors - it will leave you deaf. We quickly ate and ask for the deserts to go. Ownership needs to solve this problem because frankly, it's not worth it to go there, great food or not."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurant in Charlotte. Very eclectic and the hurricanes are strong and good. Now that we got drinks out the way.  During your visit. Get the bbq shrimp for the appetizer and it won't disappoint. For dinner i got the étouffée. It was so savory and spicy. This place is one of Charlotte's best kept secret."}
{"text":"It was ok not as good as i remembered. I was excited to drive up to Charlotte just for Cajun Queen."}
{"text":"The bar/patio is crowded and drinks are good, but the seafood is just not fresh enough. The etouffee wasn't spicy, and a friend's fried fish was that mushy consistency of something that's been frozen too long. I was with a party of 11 and no one was particularly pleased with the food or the wait time. The best part of the experience was the wonderful jazz group that performed in the crowded dining room with verve and style."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever gone here without a Groupon. I always get the Chicken Diane. There is usually a 3-piece jazz band playing upstairs when it starts getting dark."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Cajun Queen. The food is always on point. The service is pretty good as well. My favorite thing here is the Salmon with the Shrimp and ham topping. So so so good. They also have amazing desserts. The one thing I don't like is their choice of rolls. They're way too hard for me. But the food is amazing, atmosphere and service as well! Will always come back."}
{"text":"We eat at the Cajun Queen regularly...there are always Groupons!  My dad is from Louisiana so he knows his cajun/creole food, and this place has fantastic food.  Amazing atmosphere!!  One of my favorite restaurants ever."}
{"text":"We went to the Cajun Queen for Sunday brunch. We had an 11:00 reservation so we were the first ones in the restaurant. We were greeted by our hostess and two servers who were smiling, friendly, and ready to go. 
We ordered the beignets with homemade strawberry jam for starters, warm, light, sprinkled with powdered sugar, yummy! 
We had the tasso biscuits and gravy, an omelet, the crab cake eggs benedict, and chicken strips with French fries from the kids menu.  Everything was great including the service and unsweetened iced tea.  The serving size was large, but not excessive.  When we were finished, we were too full to try the Key Lime pie which we were told was to die for. 
If I had any complaint, it would be that the tables are a little too small for the generously sized plates, but this is a small place, so the small tables are a necessary requirement. The jazz music is a little loud, but not obnoxious, and is appropriate for the New Orleans Cajun and creole menu. 
All in all, a very pleasant experience. We will be going back for dinner to try the regular entrees."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try Cajun Queen for a while. I originally heard about it from my sister who was going to meet a friend out there.  I was SERIOUSLY planning to third wheel it and she didn't mind (b/c in her mind it wasn't a date)  .. but when she asked him about me tagging along he responded with a \"you mean she comes on our date\" Welp... at that point she realized it was a date (duh) and his ego was a bit bruised ... medium story short I never made it out there. 

Cajun Queen is in an interesting location I haven't explored this part of Charlotte much.... only in passing. It's a tight space inside , we went at an off time so we had ample room but I wonder about dinner time how crowded it can be. Our waiter was super nice and explained the menu to us as well as made some recommendations on the spicy and not so spicy. I am a huge shrimp fan so I had the Diane with Shrimp. It was pretty tasty and spicy to me, and had me stuffed! It appears that they give you huge portions for your entrée which is nice. I also had a side of gumbo , which  honestly tasted a bit like chili. This was my first gumbo experience so I'm not really sure what to think in terms of taste but I have heard from a friend who lives in NO that it's not supposed to taste like chili. 

I came on a Sunday afternoon so there was no live band , and it was super cold so we couldn't sit on the patio. Overall I thought it was a nice meal and nice place with reasonable prices for the amount of food you receive. The parking is a bit annoying but I guess you can always park on the street! 

Oh it seems that they run on reservations so I would recommend one!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was very happy. The restaurant had a lot of character, our waiter was excellent and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend you giving it a try."}
{"text":"Came here craving Cajun food and am glad we did. Restaurant has about 8 parking spots in the rear. Service was very subpar especially since it wasn't busy. Had to ask 3 times for more butter. Waiter didn't come back to check on us. First cup of coffee was lukewarm. 

But this place makes it up with good food EXCEPT the seafood gumbo. It was more on the watery side and bland to taste. We expected they would have good gumbo but it was not satisfying. Started with the fried oyster appetizer and found it weird to be at market price. The half order was so small and costs $13. It was good but not worth the money. The crawfish etouffee, however, was mind blowing. Maybe the best I had? So much flavor and many pieces of crawfish. Ended the meal with pecan pie and wowwwww! We licked the plate! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place!  Recommended as a good date night place by a coworker. Our bill plus 3 drinks was about $87 including tip. They accept reservations and offer valet parking. The wait staff was very friendly.  Our waiter suggested a few nice bars in the area - which we appreciated because we are not familiar with the Charlotte area. 

We enjoyed the food and the ambiance.  My wife ordered the blackened chicken and she thought it was great...great flavor and juicy.  The portions were perfect.  We also enjoyed their pecan pie and key lime pie...both quite tasty. 

The meal was excellent the server was excellent also!  

We will definitely visit again..."}
{"text":"Five star service from all of the staff. Five star food served in a vintage setting with low ambience. OMG I've  been to New Orleans & their food qualifies as authentic Cajun food."}
{"text":"One oft favorite joints in Charlotte. Between the jazz band, etoufee, and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, a small hole in the wall gem! Great customer service and clean. Will definitely be back when in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I took my mom and grandmother for a Mother's Day brunch. The food is excellent and service was fast (especially for a holiday). Our server wasn't very engaging, but that could have been a fluke. All in all, great choice!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I spent our anniversary in New Orleans. Fell in love with thefood. Always trying to track down good Cajun. Prices are up there but the seasoning and flavors brought me back down to the french quarter. There was a woops on the doneness off the steak quickly fixed and removed from the bill. Only thing I could ask for is boudan."}
{"text":"Great food and love that they have a band so you get the entertainment as you dine. The only issue is parking... I'm not big on valet so I would prefer to park my own car."}
{"text":"I went to Cajun Queen to celebrate my birthday. My entire dinner party was very satisfied with their meal. Plus the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Coming from the northeast, me and Cajun anything were not acquainted until I came to the Cajun Queen. Most Cajun food is not vegan friendly, but the chef at Cajun Queen went the extra mile and created me a veg-friendly dish! I had a Creole sauce mixed with a TON of veggies and served with rice on the side.

The atmosphere is what sells me on the Cajun Queen, an intimate setting that is laid out in a big house. Upstairs has jazz music, while downstairs has a bunch of little tables for small parties.

I'll definitely be back! Cajun/Creole is definitely a different type of food than what I usually grab."}
{"text":"So I know we're not exactly in Cajun country, but this place is still awesome and, as far as I can tell, super authentic. It's an amazing venue for food--really cool, old house--you feel like you're eating at an actual home--a nice one--on the Bayou or something. Or at least that's how it felt to a transplanted Yankee like myself. 

Great southern style cocktails here, so make sure you try at least one before dinner. I'm talking Souther Comfort mixed with all sorts of stuff--just amazing. And they're strong, so go easy. 

I had the catfish dish, and it was incredible. Hard to describe, but it was blackened with an amazing tangy sauce and came with mashed potatoes and greens. Their menu is really different, so make sure to check out all that's available. I'll definitely be back do so."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had dinner at Cajun Queen tonight and ordered the sirloin special. It was not very good so the manager, Tim, came over and offered something else. We ordered the tilapia special and it was delicious. We also had the crawfish etoufee, gumbo and keylime pie. All were yummy."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was amazing!!!  The jazz band added such a great feel and fun experience."}
{"text":"Everyone in our party of 3 thoroughly enjoyed their meal. Sat on their outdoor patio which was very pleasant should the weather permit. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"All around this place was great! Atmosphere is one of a kind and when they had the band upstairs, it's a different feel. The food was very good and plenty. Staff was very friendly and informative. Very close to where we live and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and just as amazing wait staff. Highly recommend the Diane with Shrimp. Also dont forget to look at the daily specials. I had a Groupon for todays visit but have gone before on others recommendations. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The fried oysters are to die for.

The crayfish scampi looks great but a bit too garlicky.

The BBQ shrimp is just a-ok.

Real cool how they turned an old house into CQ."}
{"text":"Can you believe it took me 20 years of living in Charlotte before I tried the Cajun Queen?  I guess i have preconceived notions as to what Cajun food is like crawfish, beans, rice which are typically things I don't go for.

Yeah, I was wrong.  Not everything has all that including what I had last night.  The Blackend pork tenderloin was truly amazing.  Just the right level of spice and it was served with crispy fried plantains.  I'm still trying to figure out what the covering on the plantains were.  Also served with a black been puree which was tasty.  The side salad had a spicy vinagrette.  The only disappointment with the salad is that the carrot strips looked like they were right out of the bag you get at Harris Teeter.

Another flaw is that this dinner was with the dinner group.  I called a week in advance to reserve space for 12.  When we got there, they weren't ready for us.  We waited for a tables to be pushed together after being told the patio was full by one person when there was only one table in use.  After waiting a short time at the bar, we asked another person if we could sit outside and she said that would be easier on her.  So why couldn't we go out there to begin with.  

Oh well.  That's my only complaint.  Otherwise, the service was spot on.  Water and other drinks were refilled promptly and plates were taken away quickly.

Yes, this is a place I must come back to.  

Word of warning...parking is a bear here.  It might be easier parking across the street."}
{"text":"Love this place!  One of my wife's favorite places for special occasions.  Seafood etouffee is outstanding and so is the shrimp creole.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a really solid brunch spot.  I haven't dined here other than that, so keep that in mind.

We started with an order of beignets as well as a fried green tomatoes app.  The beignets were exactly what you want in a deep fried confection: pillowy, soft but not doughy, with a tender outer crumb and a sprinkling of powdered sugar.  The compote that it comes with is also very tasty.

The fried green tomatoes were very good, as well.  They come on a bed of mixed greens with a remoulade over the top.  The remoulade was delicious and the tomatoes themselves were fried well.  My only wish was for a bit more salt in the batter; otherwise a bite of tomato without any remoulade was a bit lacking.

For our entrees I got the spicy tasso biscuits and gravy.  Holy goodness, was this dish rich.  The gravy was probably 50% fat (that's a good thing).  The tasso wasn't really spicy but it was tasty.  It came with a couple eggs scrambled over the top that were a nice textural contrast.  The biscuits themselves were world-class.  Extremely tender, perfectly baked, and an excellent accompaniment for the other components of the dish.  I was practically licking my plate after I'd eaten all the food.

My wife got fried green tomatoes eggs benedict.  I didn't try hers but the eggs were perfectly poached and I know from the app we had that the tomatoes were good.  She also had a little fruit salad on the side from which I nabbed a couple grapes.

Service was prompt, plates were cleared in a timely manner, and our table was in a porch area to the side that allowed us to get a glimpse of the beautiful weather outdoors.  We were stuffed to the gills so Independence Park being right across the street allowed us to take a lovely stroll immediately after.

Definitely worth a repeat visit, maybe for dinner next time."}
{"text":"I visited twice in-town as a flight attendant. Incredible food, music, atmosphere, and service. I'll be back whenever I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte. We had the Cajun fried oysters for the appetizer and i had the New Orleans Platter as my entree. All of it was amazing."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner here tonight! My party dined on the fried pickle chips, the chicken étouffée, the chicken creole, the bourbon pecan pie, and the oreo cookie cheesecake. Oh we also had the Peach Aloha and Hurricane to drink. Everything was great! We cleaned all of our plates and enjoyed the atmosphere. The set up was nice, albeit a tad cramped upstairs. At times it was a little hard to talk amongst ourselves with the band playing, but this was not a deal breaker because the band took plenty of breaks so that everyone could eat, talk, and relax in peace. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"most excellent dinner. Our table enjoyed shrimp and grits immensely,  as well as the pork tenderloin, and the dianes.   seating is tight,  but I guess popular restaurants try to squeeze everyone in best they can:-)"}
{"text":"My fiance had the blackened filet, the mixed etouffee, crayfish appetizer, BBQ shrimp appetizer, and bread pudding for dessert. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Totally delicious!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! This restaurant is located in a very old house, so it's got a lot of character and ambience. We ate outside, which was nice, although we missed hearing the live jazz band. 

Lengthy cocktail menu with lots of great New Orleans favorites like hurricanes, swamp water, and such. 

We had the fried green tomatoes, gumbo, and etoufee. Very delicious! 

Our waitress was really attentive and nice. Excellent server. 

Parking seemed a little daunting at first, but luckily, we scrounged up some cash (we're usually a debit card-only household) so we could tip the valet guys. Valet itself is free. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"The amount of food received for $18 was not pleasing. Packaged was a handful of rice and 12 oz  cup of shrimp and spices as my entree for the new orleans bbq shrimp. I probably wont order again."}
{"text":"I've been to Cajun Queen a few times now and I've been extremely satisfied with both the high level of customer service and also the food quality.  First, I showed up about 20 minutes late for my reservation (I know, I'm that guy) and they were able to seat us right away on a Friday night.  No questions, no hassle, they simply sent us to an open table as if we had showed up right on time for our reservation.  We had our 3 year old son with us so we each breathed a sigh of relief once seated.

Initially I wasn't sure what to order, until I started leafing through pictures on Yelp.  While it all looked good, the Shrimp and Grits stopped me in my tracks.  It wasn't your everyday Shrimp and Grits as they've given it a nice Cajun twist by adding a tasty creole sauce.  The shrimp had a distinct smokey flavor that worked really well with the dish.  The Andouille sausage also packed a nice punch that really pulled the whole meal together.  

For dessert we ordered the Tollhouse Cookie Pie.  I had never had anything quite like it before.  It was really good; however, we both felt as though it could have had more chocolate chips.  The walnuts added a nice dimension too."}
{"text":"Review for Brunch! 
*Hidden gem for brunch in Charlotte 
*Menu is light, but food and service are incredible 

We visited Cajun Queen for Easter Brunch. I wasn't sure what to expect since it was Easter. I don't think CQ did anything different to their menu- it was one page of items but the offerings were so compelling that we did not mind. 

I had the fried green tomatoes Benedict and my boyfriend had the bourbon french toast. We also ordered the beignet. The beignets were devoured in 0.5 seconds. The jam they serve it with is absolutely incredible. 

This was my first time at CQ. What stood out to me was the service. We ate around 11, so it was right when they opened on Sunday, but the servers were constantly asking us if we needed any additional coffee or anything else. 

Only reason why it gets 4 stars was because of the limited options (not sure how often they change up the menu) and because they only serve plain coffee. Sometimes I like to spice it up and get a latte or cappuccino with brunch. 

They did have a drink menu (including hurricanes!) for brunch but we stuck to coffee this time. 

I was impressed with the quality of food and pricing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food nice atmosphere, service was great. There was a mix up with our food, manager came without requesting and comp our meal. Will definately return!"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte and went to Cajun Queen with my partner. The ambiance was great, our server was perfect and the food was amazing! I promise we will visit Cajun Queen for date night every time we visit Charlotte! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I flew into and out of Charlotte for a wedding about 4 weeks ago and were lucky enough to spot this place for lunch over the weekend. We shared Chicken Diane (Mushrooms, garlic, butter, green onions, parsley and our Queen's magic spices - all sautéed together. Moderately spiced and served over rice) and some Bignets for dessert (on the brunch menu). We loved the food we ordered so much- and one plate was definitely enough to share. The service was friendly and fast. If we are ever in the Charlotte area, we definitely plan to come back!"}
{"text":"So incredibly let down by this dining experience. Our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded. Half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts. Meanwhile, the food was terrible. The fried green tomatoes lacked any kind of seasoning and the crawfish etouffee was bland and not at all spicy. The tollhouse cookie pie was also a travesty. How does one mess up a cookie pie?! At least the key lime pie was good, but not worth the $250 dollar bill :("}
{"text":"Bro's and Holesome ladies, this place is phenomenal!! See my Mahi Mahi dish below, but we also crushed some bbq skrimps that were also amazing. Used the juice to dip bread in and almost asked for a straw! Come by, completely worth it!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Cajun Queen! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is so pleasant. Dress it up or be totally casual, you will feel right at home. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. Did I mention the food is delicious?"}
{"text":"I've been to Cajun Queen a couple times, once for a work meeting and once on a date with my boyfriend. The meeting was definitely the better experience solely in terms of food, everything was spot on and delicious - I especially loved the crawfish scampi! For my entree I went with tilapia which tasted very good. 

The last time we went service was slow (it was a weekday), and the food surprisingly forgettable. We split the calamari appetizer which was pretty standard and each had the steak Diane. I am a rare girl but found the meat a bit tough- usually filet should be easy to cut through, this wasn't the case. 

I'd say stick to your seafood options, give yourself some extra time to dine, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I had the Dianne and it was everything I imagined it would be. We had a seat next to the fireplace which set the mood perfect!"}
{"text":"Tonight we went here for dinner. The food was pretty good. I had the shrimp and grits the shrimp had a very fishy after taste. Considering that I eat shrimp often I couldn't really shake the after taste. The sausage was burnt. Making it very disappointing. The grits however were solid. My boyfriend got the platter and he said it was good. And my son got chicken tenders. At 4, those are always good. I'm willing to give the place another chance in hopes of it being better next time. We definitely want to try brunch for the live jazz. It wasn't bad however it left much to be desired."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Cajun Queen's food. It's been one of my favorite places to eat in the Queen City, but not this particular time. I'm not sure if all the groupons have made them cut back on providing quality food, or if there's someone new in the kitchen, but everything was off. The steak which usually melts in your mouth, was very tough and quite fatty for a ribeye. It was hard to dig through it for an edible piece. The broccoli on both of the dishes my boyfriend and I ordered was very tough as well. In a failed attempt to course out our meal, our waitress left us feeling like an afterthought when we couldn't find her for simple things like refilled glasses or clean silverware. The only plus to our experience was the hostess staff at the door. They were very inviting & seated us quickly right where we would be most comfortable. I really appreciated the extra effort to give us an option. But overall, despite the awesome deal, I doubt I will be back to Cajun Queen any time soon."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast, as we were in the mood for beignets. The beignets were more crisp than soft, which isn't to my taste, so that was a miss, but the omelette was very good and the Elvis Presley French toast was appropriately over-the-top rich. The service was friendly and attentive, so we will be back again."}
{"text":"So delicious! Must try the étouffée and bread pudding! The restaurant offers complimentary valet and the staff is quite friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the seafood gumbo and the crawfish creole. When we weren't able to spare the time to have a sit down dinner, I would sometimes have the limousine drive me here just to pick up dinner. Sigh, if only it delivered..."}
{"text":"My friend  from New York came to visit. Read the reviews were good so we decided to go.  We arrived about 940pm Saturday night....it was a bit crowded, noisy and somewhat of an unfriendly environment.  Once greeted by the host,  she proceeded to take us to a crowded room with children and loud conversations.  We asked to move to the other side of the restaurant,  but she stated the server wasn't taken anymore tables. (hence they were closing soon).....once seated in the upstairs sectio. We were quiet happy with our table sevtion ...our server Taylor was superb gave great recommendations and was honest about the menu items.....  The food was not as  good as expected ....I ordered the crawfish  etouffe half order. It had no taste as though they scrapped the bottom of the barrel with a somewhat burnt taste......my friend ordered the fried oysters for an appetizer which she said was extremely good.  She also order a signature cocktail which I tasted and agree it was strong and good......I would give this restaurant  another try and however; I would definitely arrive before  closing hiurs....great location and nice abeyance"}
{"text":"This is one of the few spots in Charlotte that I constantly find myself going back to. I like trying different things at restaurants, but every time I go in I can't help but get the Crawfish Scampi to start off and the Chicken Diane as an entree. The flavors and seasoning are unbelievable and the atmosphere is great upstairs with a Jazz band playing every night."}
{"text":"Rolled up to the complimentary valet on the coldest Friday in several years with a cute chick and no reservations. Got a little concerned when a group left out complaining about the wait but we were seated almost immediately at a table in the lounge (it pays to travel with a cute chick!) Not too noisy, good mix of hot and cool jazz that pairs well with the foods.
Beau showed right up, introduced himelf and got to recommending dinners which was great for me since I know precious little about Cajun. We started with shrimp something; half-dozen shrimps hot off the broiler swimming around a sculpted lemon in a boat of crazy good hot barbeque juice. Lovely bride was quite pleased with the zippiness (flavory spicing, not just heat) of the sauce and got a togo cup for the left over bit.
Moved on to Chicken Etouffee while my lovely bride had shrimp-n-grits. Well yeah it was good!! (as if i have a clue how it's supposed to taste) Moist tender chickens sauced up in a warm lingering mellow sort of mood enhancer over a mound of very ricey rice. 
MLB was quite pleased with her dinner, thanks to y'all Yelpers who recommended!! Said it was most enjoyable especially as she had missed the bit about the andouilles.
Finished the night with a delightful bourboned bread pudding. Yea bread pudding!"}
{"text":"havent been there since i was a kid with my parents and after last night i will not go back. who's ever heard of bland cajun food, well somehow they pulled it off. i can make far better cajun food that at least has taste. the gumbo was terrible and the grits from the shrimp and grits were even worse, thank goodness they had habanero sauce to add some taste to this miserably bland dish. they did have dixie lager and dixIes blackened voodoo lager which is the only reason theyre not getting one star. the bartender was not pleasant either she obviously did not want to be there and it showed, when there are only 3 people in front of you, you should keep their water glasses full and beers a-comin' .  the band was nice and the place itself is nice but im never going back, hotel charlotte, danny's too and especially boudreaux's are all much better with regards to cajun creole cuisine"}
{"text":"Best creole place in Charlotte we have ordered a number of different items and they are all good.  Had the fried oysters and BBQ shrimp as an appetizer last time and they were really good.  We sat upstairs and listened to the band in the next room.  Not too loud and an overall great experience."}
{"text":"I think there is something special about a place that has been able to make it through the changing landscape of Charlotte, Elizabeth in particular. This place is a step back in time, you can tell they haven't changed much with the exterior/interior. It's a place you can take your grandparents to (like I did), or go for a date night or with friends. They have a nice beer and cocktail list. I had the BBQ shrimp and absolutely loved the spicy sauce. Let me warn you, it is spicy! Perfect for dipping bread and butter in though. My grandma got the salt and pepper catfish and it was melt in your mouth! Service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Pineville location before, and I have to say that the experience there is many times better than this one (at least on this night).  While everything was decent, nothing really came together.  

The jazz band was decent, just don't make the mistake of sitting in the same room if you actually want to enjoy your meal, talk with your companions, that sort of thing.  If you're going for the music, that's fine, but for a quiet evening, it is not the room to sit in!"}
{"text":"Everyone appeared as if they were extremely busy so rubbed off as rude hostess and servers. My server never gave me the Valentine's Day special nor did he recommend or discuss the menu. It was me and my husband first time going and based off the poor service and probably just wrong choice of dishes due to no guidance from server,  we will not be going back. Our bill was $100 and we didn't enjoy our food or service."}
{"text":"I take everyone that comes to visit me to Cajun Queen!  From the great food (my favorite is the bbq shrimp and bread to dip into the sauce), to the live jazz and great service, this is a restaurant not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Came with a friend and the house is really cute. It's a plus that they also have valet parking when you pull up. Inside is nice. Atmosphere is warm and cozy. We sat by the fireplace. I ordered the etouffee with chicken, shrimp and crawfish. It was good. Very flavorful, I didn't even have to put tobacco sauce in it because the spices were on point. I wasn't crazy about their bread, it was really hard. My friend had the gumbo soup and I tried it and it was delicious. They were pretty busy on a weekday. We saw the waiter maybe 3 times-When he greeted us, when he took our order and dropped off the check. He never came by in between to check on us or fill up our drinks.Service wasn't that great but I will definitely give it another try. Other than that, food was good!"}
{"text":"If you like your appetizers before your drinks....this is your place. Table had empty salt and pepper shakers. The hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty. This is NOT authentic Cajun food! The Champagne was flat.....horrible experience. Waiter was aloof."}
{"text":"We had a reservation via Yelp and were seated immediately on the first floor. We were provided the menu and the waiter pointed out the daily specials. I wish he spent more time to acclimate us to the menu and what Cajun Queen was known for. I really wanted to be on the level where the Jazz was, but that wasn't offered.
My husband got the New Orleans platter and I had the fried shrimp and oysters. Our food was cooked perfectly and my topper of crawfish and artichoke hearts was delicious.
We will be back."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place! The food was so good . I took my wife for a birthday dinner.  I will give you some advice ..please make a resveration"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday to eat dinner. Food and service top notch again. Our servers name was Kevin, he did a good job!!  However, if you go and try to park near the restaurant......BEWARE OF THE VALETS!! One ran up on me yesterday and told me that I can't park where I was parking. I asked him why and he told me its for valet service. VALETS CANNOT STOP PEOPLE FROM PARKING ON PUBLIC STREETS !!!!!!! Or block public parking spots!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited about eating tasty, authentic Cajun food.  Really confused about the reason our experience and food did not match up to the other reviews that I read before booking my reservation.

We came here to celebrate a successful event at work. We were a party of five very diverse diners but we all left food on our plates because it was average.  The men actually left seafood and meat in the portions they left on the table because the tastes were so bland.

Watery gumbo started off our meals. It was similar to the consistency of Progresso soups, we could have saved these calories and yes it has shrimp, sausage but why is gumbo so transparent and without a hint a peppers, garlic, etc. We pressed on.

Our party's entree choices were all different some had Diane,  Creole and a few combined appetizers to make an entree. No one finished their meal. Only one person even bothered to take home their leftovers.

The hostess was wonderful, the waiter was okay - he was not happy very curt with all his answers, he looked annoyed by our inquiries about menu items.  He should have just said if you don't know about our menu then you should not be here-boom!  The valet staff was pleasant, quick  and accommodating - Bravo!


We will go back because all the other reviews indicate that we had an unusual visit. I will update my review when I return."}
{"text":"What a surprising gem of a restaurant! Each dish reminded us of our many enjoyable meals in NOLA, with a beautiful layering of flavors. The 7th Street Gator band played toe-tapping Jazz to finish a wonderful evening. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with great food and impeccable service. Order the catfish or the shrimp and grits, Hell, order anything. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The closest to New Orleans cuisine I've had outside of New Orleans.  Great atmosphere and reasonable prices.  The BBQ Shrimp and Red Beans & Rice entrees are very good.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"With out a doubt my favorite restaurant!! Most constant service and food everytime. The best  ever. The chicken diane and bbq shrimp are the best. But don't sleep on the salt and pepper fried catfish. Yummy."}
{"text":"Each entree came with the choice of salad or soup (GUMBO)! Shrimp and Grits w/sausage and New Orleans Platter was tasty. Downstairs women's bathroom lock broken so unless you are ok with someone walking in on you you may want to go upstairs to use the women's bathroom."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here last night with friends and family. The blackened catfish was delicious and so was the cajun  scampi appetizer!  My husband said his pork etouffe' was amazing and he had a large, delicious drink to take him through the entire meal.  I will make this place a regular when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I always begin with the fried popcorn- crawfish! Amazing! The fried green tomatoes are a hit as well! All dishes are great. If you don't like spicy- steer clear of the gumbo....I love spicy so it's great-not too tomatoes favor, but a good consistency. My favorite dish is the New Orleans Platter. The pork chop or other platters are great too!"}
{"text":"I must update my review with some favorite dishes...this is Cajun deliciousness: 

Barbecue shrimp: Nom nom nom. The sauce on these shrimp is outstanding and the little crustaceans are perfectly cooked! I could easily make a meal out of these tasty creatures of the sea. 

Shrimp grits: Seriously creamy and dreamy. The shrimp are sizeable and plump! You'll want to live in these grits...you know, make a home in the bowl. 

Bread pudding: I'm not even a huge bread pudding person and their peach bread pudding is outstanding - the perfect amount of sweet and savory. It's love reincarnated.

Cajun Queen can great really crowded so be aware of that when you plan your evening. And, be sure to catch the Cajun Queen band when you can...those guys are amazing!"}
{"text":"I will start with the positives, the atmosphere is very nice and our waiter Alex was very nice and helpful. They have live music in the evenings which was nice as well. What I didn't like was the food. The food had hardly any flavor in my opinion. When I think of Cajun or new Orleans style food I think of tons of flavor. Also, the prices were a bit steep for something I could have made at home. I did enjoy my french quarter coffee! I would return just to sit on the rooftop deck and have a drink but the food was mediocre. Once again the service was great everyone was friendly who worked there. If you want good service and a great atmosphere to hear some live jazz/blues this is a good spot. If you are looking for delicious food you may want to try elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Cajun Queen is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I have lived in Charlotte for 7 years and been to 4 birthday dinners at Cajun! The Creole with shrimp, crawfish and chicken is my go-to meal. I always get the gumbo as an appetizer and my wife loves the bbq shrimp. I probably eat a load of bread every visit, because the sauces are so good and I dip the bread in the gumbo, creole and bbq shrimp sauces! The atmosphere is very New Orleans and feels like the Big Easy, especially if you sit upstairs by the bar when Jazz is playing."}
{"text":"Well.. I was expecting to listen to a band while eating my food... The waiter forgot my mashed potatos lol....I really wanted it... The food was ok I had the chicken diane my husband had the shrimp and grits. I can say you will leave full and will have to take a to go box.. Oh the gumbo was very under seasoned."}
{"text":"Had a reservation and was seated on time ordered shrimp scampi and they came out with shrimp diane, took it back and i waited finally brought right dish out but my husband was wlmost done with his meal so he watched me eat, it was good but didnt enjoy my experience because i felt bad for my husband watching me so i ate fast they did give a free desert that was incredible"}
{"text":"Have been there a few times and they never disappoint!  The Jambalaya is second to none.  Perfectly spiced and portioned.  The New Orleans BBQ is also excellent.  Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great setting, Great food. Great value. Its a part of our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Cute lil house that was bigger than it looked from the outside was very spacious and big windows there was 4 of us table should have been a lil bigger we had to keep having the waiter take things away for space aT the table but that wasn't a big deal the dishes was great great we really enjoyed our meals I was a lil bummed that the staff didn't mention the band playing on the upper level and they posted on flyers that it was restaurant week no Groupon accepted that should be stated during reservations booking other than that everything was good"}
{"text":"Best Cajun food I've ever had. I should know, I've been to Mardi Gras 4 times. Recommend throwing a dart at the menu, everything is good. Bo was very nice and very patient with us."}
{"text":"This establishment always has all the goods to impress and satisfy my palette over and over again. Last time I had a 14oz pork chop with BBQ sauce and potatoes that just looked and tasted like one of the best meals I ever had. The dessert Tollhouse cookie pie finished off the night with pure bliss."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the best NOLA inspired dishes in the city. The atmosphere of this place makes me feel like I'm sitting in New Orleans."}
{"text":"I ordered salmon with shrimp sauce and mashed potatoes. It was seasoned well and the portion was sufficient. My friend ordered shrimp and grits and she wasn't impressed. There was a small amount off red sauce, possibly a tomato based sauce, that covered a small portion of the grits. My friend did not like the sauce. The grits seemed to be a little runny and the portion size seemed small. Both entrees were served with a choice of gumbo or a side salad.
I was impressed by the waitress's concern that my friend didn't like the shrimp and grits. She offered to provide a different dish And when the offer wasn't accepted, she removed the entree from our bill without being asked to do so,which tells me that Cajun Queen values their patrons."}
{"text":"LOVE me some Cajun Queen.  Love it.  Love the intimate atmosphere, love the jazz band upstairs... and the hubster loves the 7th Street Stumbler (have you ever seen a 6'4, 300lb man stumble? It's not pretty).

FGT's are to DIE for.  I'm a northerner, so I don't really have a ton of iterations to compare them to, but they are pretty damn good.

Crawfish. Etoufee. 'Nuff said.  So flavorful and delicious.

This is one of our top 10 restaurants in the QC.  Worth a visit, fo sho!"}
{"text":"Unexpected surprise. And a pleasant one.
Cute part of the city (Elizabeth) with other historic homes around it, Cajun Queen has been around since 1985 in this hundred year old house 

They have nightly jazz which on cool fall evenings fills the breeze flowing through the southern charm of the house 

There are tables on the first floor and a full bar upstairs.
They also have complimentary valet.

I tried the 'Cajun popcorn' as an appetizer (they also give you bread rolls and butter). This is fried battered crawfish. A bit rich, couldn't finish all of it.
The etouffé  was also reliably authentic and somewhat on the rich side (I chose the etouffé with all three {shrimp, crawfish, shrimp}) although I think the chicken is best left out altogether.

This place is one of the charlotte landmarks I'd say. Five stars for ambience, three for food, four for service. Four overall."}
{"text":"Good Cajun food is sometime hard to find, so bookmark this place.
If you are in the Charlotte, NC are make sure you plan a dinner stop at this establishment.

The best Cajun Cookin' I've had outside of Louisiana.

The Étouffée was delicious, I had it with Chicken, Shrimp, Crawfish, and Andouille Sausage, and its was perfect. All the protines were cooked perfectly. The spice and flavour was outstanding."}
{"text":"Food is spicy and a reservation is ideal. My daughter & I visited on a Friday night around 9 was nervous assuming we would feel out of place but the staff was friendly...gave my daughter mardy gras beads very unpretentious..food was excellent"}
{"text":"NOT my favorite Cajun food I've eaten. I wanted GUMBALAYA, which the waiter INSULTED as not REAL Cajun food AND he said was like the McDonalds of Cajun food. I wasn't mad at that at all because that may ACTUALLY be TRUE. So I ordered something else that wasn't what I wanted. IT WAS MEH. 

THE DESSERT was amazing though. OREO CHEESECAKE nom nom."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, and I say this as a person who frequents N'awlins and loves the food there.  I will say the portions are large and fillling. So keep that in mind when ordering appetizers etc.  The Diane was good and the fried crawfish is a new fave.  The gumbo...well I've had better but others may like it. Everything though good during my visit was very under seasoned-but easily adjusted with a couple of salt and pepper shakes-maybe that's on purpose to make it more mainstream.  But regardless worth a try and I would probably come back."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 overall for me. 

I met my BIL here for dinner - he said it's insanely popular, so we arrived pretty much as they opened. Be aware that parking in the area is a huge challenge but there is valet service available. They've got signs everywhere warning that if you park in other business lots you'll be booted and towed. 

I love that they're in an old house - the room we sat in had a beautifully preserved tile fireplace and I'm told the upstairs has a great bar. 

The menu is a nice rundown of classics - jambalaya, blackened this-and-that, etc. we started with a small order of blackened shrimp, which arrived swimming in a wonderfully spicy broth. Pro tip - save those bread rolls they give you to soak up this juice. 

Entree wise, I had shrimp and grits which netted me a huge amount of coarse ground grits with a decent amount of shrimp, in s nicely spiced sauce. A few of my shrimp were over cooked but the flavor was there. 

We had no issues getting seated since we arrived at opening but it seems like reservations are the way to go. Cajun Queen isn't near as good as real NOLA cooking but it's way better than what most serve."}
{"text":"The service is very casual as is the entire restaurant. Service is great.

The food is ok, nothing special. The shrimp crab gumbo was pretty good but not hot (as in temp.) enough. The blackened catfish was a huge portion but disappointing, all paprika & chill powder no other seasoning! The veg served was thumbs down, room temp. Broccoli and flavorless over boiled mash potato's! One of the few times I left the starch on the plate.

The meal wasn't bad but acceptable at best!"}
{"text":"As most foodies know, a large part of the dining experience is the service.  If the food is magnificent, you can get away with slightly lesser service, but Cajun Queen wasn't tasty enough (but it was good!) to counter the experience of bad service.

The free valet is a nice touch, because parking is a beast around there.  The hostess was busy but seated us kindly.  Then the waiter showed up.  He seemed put out with us, but as the night progressed, it became clear that he might have been irritated with a loud party behind us, because he became slightly less aggravated when they left.  The second bummer of the night was where we were sitting seemed to be a hugely traveled path for people coming and going all night long.  I was bumped every few seconds all night long.  Tiresome.

Seafood Gumbo should have been blowing my doors off with flavor, but instead it was just okay.  I was a little disappointed with the mildness of it.  Needed something.

I had the Crawfish Etouffee and it was really too similar to the gumbo.  I should have made a better choice.  But, it had the same problems as the Gumbo, being too bland.  I guess I just expected more.

My friend had Chicken Diane.  It's a sautéed breast of chicken with mushrooms, green onions, Cajun spices, garlic, butter and parsley.  All served over rice.  Though it was pretty rich, it was a solid dish.

Dessert was again, fine.  There really weren't that many choices, so I chose pecan pie.  It was fine, presentation was pretty lame.  I know, what can you do with a slice of pie.  But 3 or 4 puffs of whip cream from a can has to be one of the least fancy ways to dress it.

We may try it again, perhaps we were there on an off night?  I do like to give a few chances before writing a place off, but this night was not a good showing for this landmark Charlotte restaurant.

(This review from my personal blog)"}
{"text":"Albeit they were a little slow in getting us to our table despite a reservation, the quality of the food and the service made up for the late start.  An appetizer of Barbecued Shrimp kicked off the evening awaking the taste buds and preparing them for the main course.   Of course you cannot let the waiter take any of the broth way from the table remaining from the BBQ shrimp.  That would just be wrong. My wife had the crawfish Diane, a delightful dish with ample spices, but not too much, lots of crawfish and fresh mushrooms. I had the New Orleans platter offering fried catfish, oyster, scallops and shrimp along with red beans and dirty rice. The scallops were huge, the catfish cooked and seasoned to perfection and well everything was just great. Our only negative to post is the noise level in the restaurant. It is very difficult to have a conversation at a table without staining your voice. The beer, wine and mixed drink selections were good although they were out of fresh mint so no mojitos that evening.  I recommend trying the place on a week night when It may not be so crowded and noises. You won't go wrong with the food."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that we found this gem. This is the best food I've had in my 3 years living in Charlotte. Very relaxed atmosphere. The Cajun BBQ Shrimp Entree is delicious. Also, the Crawfish Scampie is yummy. They have live Jazz upstairs 7 nights a week. Make sure to reserve a table if you'd like to sit upstairs for the jazz. The servers are all kind and friendly. If your tired of the regular chain restaurants in Charlotte, this is the place to go eat."}
{"text":"Selection of \"lighter\" healthier Options is limited, so I just gonwith the fried seafood and Diane. Yummm. Only complaint would be side selection  cole slaw is like mayo drowned slop and I have found worms in the streamed broccoli!   It can happen as they are grown in dirt... but the staff didn't handle it appropriately. No suggestion of bringing another option. Just sorry. Again what can you do, half the staff looks like college kids who may not know how to deal w worms in the food. Lol."}
{"text":"I found a living social deal $20 for $40. Cajun food is a personal favorite of mine, especially eating the real deal in New Orleans.

The place is very cute an has a very jazzy,  New Orleans ambiance which I loved. Our server was very helpful by giving us his recommendations. I was very happy they had Abita beer and other great selections from Bird Song Brewery (which I thoroughly indulged in).

We ordered the BBQ shrimp and fried oysters as appetizers. The BBQ was amazing and full of flavor. The only downside was it was a little too garlicy. Oysters aren't my favorite but my boyfriend thought they were great. 

I got the étouffée and it was delicious. Generous amounts of meat and the flavor was great. It just sucked at the end of the meal when we realized it was Easter and our coupon couldn't be redeemed :( an excuse for us to go again, which we did!"}
{"text":"Ok, So here we go... The place was beautiful! Great valet parking, great atmosphere. We even got there just in time to hear the 7th street Gator Band play in the first row. The food was immaculate. Now the service... the service was HORRIBLE. The waiter (a tall white male with dark brown hair with a beard) did not good service at all. He hardly smile, or made friendly conversation. He seemed as though he could not be bother with our small requests, such as \"hey whats in this drink...what would you recommend to eat \", since it was our first time visiting this restaurant.  Yes, we were two African American women, so I really hope that was not the case. So instead of tipping the waiter, we tip the beautiful band that played live music generously.
We order Shrimp Diane and Ettoufe dish.
2 DRINKS (NEW ORLEANS ICE TEA)- Which was a small let down ..it tasted like juice.  I"}
{"text":"Great experience. I wish I was hungier when I visited. Everything I tasted was delicious. The atmosphere was fabulous and everyone was friendly. A must do in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place 3 stars, but the waitress was weird.  The bill hadn't even arrived and my date offered to pay by handing the waitress her credit card.  Being old-fashioned, I wanted to pay for dinner.  The waitress was adamant on charging dinner to whoever was the first person to give a card.  I tried in vain, but she refused which was perplexing.  It might get difficult with diners trying to make the waitress take their payment, but they have to deal with it.  Feel it out, be a little patient if need be.  Part of being a good server is being able to adjust and stuff.

Food was average - nothing special.  Three stars because the ambiance is just astounding - live jazz music and restaurant is a house, literally.

{"text":"First time dining at Cajun last night. We had a birthday party of around 12. The service was fantastic and 100% accommodating. The food was excellent! I have a shellfish allergy, so I went with the Etouffee with chicken. The dish had just the right amount of spice for my taste. Very cool atmosphere. Upstairs has a full bar and live music. I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but not great! The service and ambiance were excellent. We would go again, but are in no hurry."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place! I had the Bayou blackened fish, chicken, rice and beans and my husband had the Etouffee. We also had the fried green tomatoes. Everything was so delicious! We were there for new years eve and the service was great! Our favorite restaurant. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm a transplant from Mississippi so I'm serious about Cajun food and pretty much anything Louisiana(where I spent most of my summers). I went to Cajun Queen on a rainy Saturday night with friends and had gumbo, a delicious cocktail, and a fried catfish platter. Everything was prepared perfectly. I could almost hear the Acadian and Zydeco music playing while I ate my food! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying I'm a Louisiana native. 

I booked a last minute reservation via yelp and thank goodness I did because they were quite busy.  The Parking situation is a bit crazy but they do have a complimentary valet! The ambiance is very casual and the restaurant is a bit overcrowded.  

I ordered a cup of gumbo and the New Orleans platter. Our food came so fast... impressive! The gumbo was very bland. I don't recommend ordering it! The New Orleans platter was very big and they offer an option to split it with two people for a small up charge and slightly more food!! This was a great option. I split it with my boyfriend and we each received a huge serving of catfish, a couple shrimp, a scallop and a few oysters. I asked that the oysters be fried hard however they weren't ....so we didn't eat them. The shrimp were fine but they weren't really battered ... weird. The fried catfish was the real star of the show... no complaints. The platter also comes with a serving of red beans and rice. Traditionally red beans and rice is thick. Instead, I received a small serving of watery red beans over a lot of rice! 

In total, all this was about $40 which is very reasonable. It could be that I had really high hopes but I found this place to be disappointing.  

They do not split checks or accept groupons dated the same day of service. I suggest making a reservation to be safe and bring cash to tip valet."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)"}
{"text":"It was one of those unanticipated nights, where a coming together of long unseen friends and everyday acquaintances coalesces into something magical. It was supposed to be a mens night for the men and a ladies night for the ladies, but before we could go our separate ways the men realized they loved the ladies and the ladies too loved their men and so all together we decided not to deny ourselves the company of the other sex. Unanimously, we wanted Cajun Queen.
We were all already lit up from our daylight binging, so by the time we stumbled in we were ready for a good time. A milk-skinned hostess in a golf-green blazer and a white and peach paisley blouse batted at us with hazel eyes beneath a mop of perfectly tussled and pasted curls. \"We have eight,\" I said. She glowered. Before she could reply, I little-white-lied her: \"We called ahead... they told us to come right now.\"  
Green blazer took off to see what she could manage; we loitered in the foyer, teetering drunk, glazed eyes reeling under the light of the antique chandelier. Green blazer came back and told us it'd be a bit of wait and recommended we hit the upstairs bar. We were already halfway up the steps. 
Cajun Queen is one of those big old Elizabeth houses, southern gothic, eclectically arranged and echoing blindly with voices from some other era. It's a chatterbox of ancient heritage and white-hot with flickering, inconsistent lights that make you want to trim your mustache pencil thin and drink only from a snifter. Aroma suffused our consciousness and we all just became mindless, visceral things.
At the upstairs bar, this long swan of a bartendress was commanding the room, elegantly and fluidly fetching glasses from the overhead rack, snatching mixers from the under-counter cooler, upturning bottles and dispensing drafts, all motions in succession, all so swift and natural, like something perfectly choreographed and rehearsed. She doled out a trayful of Olde Meck Coppers and we set ourselves to achieving the night.
We were led to a corner table near the glassed wall of the little balcony at the back. I took a chair at the end, sat, leaned back, and rapped my knuckles against the abrasive texture of the mud-red stucco. Our very knowledgeable, upright waiter prattled off a series of specials and toppings of the day with juicy detail, but I all heard was 'something unbelievably amazing' followed by 'something else equally amazing'. I requested a couple batches of fried oysters for the table, and then we went in rounds, ordering our blackened catfishes and our crawfish etouffees and our obscene platters of shrimp and fish and sausage and delight.
Without needing to ask, our upright waiter returned with another round of beers and a handful of waters. \"Good man,\" I said with an acknowledging nod. Huxley was sitting at the opposite end of the table. We had subconsciously retained the man-woman divide throughout the evening. I looked her way until she felt my gaze and when she glanced back I shot her a clever wink. She smiled. I swooned. 
Our food arrived and we all collectively lost our minds. Remoulade-dipped oysters, creamy clumps of spicy rice, mouth-searing fish and peppery shrimp, beer and wine, more wine, and life and love and faces flush and hearts racing. We ate ourselves full, but couldn't stop. Flavors were assaulting us in such unmitigable ways, we were powerless to refuse their beckoning call of mouth-flaming, heart-swelling, eye-watering release. Ryan, at one point, shoved his seat back, sat up straight with hands on thighs, neck rigid like a scout-dog, let out a billowing exhale, momentarily composed himself, then jumped back in for another oyster and few more forkfuls of rice. 
At the table behind us, a prim blond let out a squelch of a cry, half-stood, leaned forward, grabbed her man behind his fuzzy dark ears, and kissed him hard on the mouth. She held that embrace for some time, and all the lights and sounds in the room imploded in upon them. When her lips broke free from his, all the noise and clarity rushed back upon us in a crash. She sat down and knuckled a tear from her eye.
 I clapped my hands and beamed across the room. \"This is the greatest night ever!\" I shouted out to the dining area. 
Kathryn, a steadying force in our group, narrowed one eye and nodded at me placatively. \"You really enjoy the hyperbole, don't you?\"
\"Get up for it, Kathryn!\" I threw my hands wildly about in the air above me. \"If it isn't the greatest night... then tell yourself it is, believe it, and make everyone else believe it too! Then it really will be!\"
The prim blond and her man giggled, and a few tables around us applauded. I ceremoniously forked the last fried oyster from our appetizer tray, held it high like a chalice, like a triumph, angled my neck, opened my jaw wide, and brought it down mightily into my mouth.
Kathryn looked around, a touch embarrassed, and then began furiously laughing. \"Oh, I believe it,\" she said. \"I believe it.\""}
{"text":"We were a loud table of 8 in the front left room for a day party. I visited Nawlins and thoroughly enjoyed the native drinks. Sooooo I ordered 5 cocktails at Cajun Queen and they were ALL AMAAAAAAAZING. The Etoufee 3 ways was spicy as hell and delish. THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE was fun and LOUD and fresh, and friendly and just a great night out. Parking was a bit tricky so get a ride there if you don't want the hassle to mess up the evening. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner here tonight of the most delectable bbq shrimp! Mmm,  mmm, mmm!  The crawfish scampi was also great. The service was awesome as well! This place is a must if you get to Charlotte! FYI the items I had were from the appetizer menu and were entree size much to my surprise!"}
{"text":"Two recommendations.  1. Get the Duck.  2. Order one of the fish specials and pick your toppings.  Oh wait three recommendations---eat it upstairs with the Gator Band.  The guys are as funny as they are old.

Warning:  By far the best dish on the menu is the BBQ shrimp.  My mouth is watering just typing the name (no kidding).  But it will give you some \"special\" breath.  Bring mints.

Tip: The Étouffée, Diane and Creole travel well and are good for catering.  We actually had a sampling for our Christmas party years back. Yum.

If you can handle the calories the BANANA FOSTERS french toast is crazy good.  I mean crazy crazy good.  It's a good thing I think they only do breakfast once a week."}
{"text":"I was checking my photo's only to find out that I have not made a review of this place. 

Me and Mine went here a few weeks ago for Brunch. 
She had the shrimp & grits
I had had the gumbo.. Everything was nice and neat, served hot (We were the 1st there so no wait)

It was close to 12noon, we had finished our food and basically waiting for the clock to strike 12 so we could order a cocktail before leaving. Well it was was sooooooo close, (maybe 5mins or so) that the waiter placed our order. 

I asked about the bloody marry (Muddy Waters), never really had one (Bloody Mary). The waiter asked.. ARE YOU SURE (with a devilish grin).... (see picture). Well after a 20 bet.. I reluctantly pulled the oyster out only to find it looks like some bull nuts (sorry for the graphic) But thats what made the bet worth wild. 

Trust and Believe, I have video of me taking the \"shot\" (its really too much drink and biggggg oyster to be a shot).

Everything went well, the waiter found it hill-arry-us.

{"text":"Cajun Queen is the best place in the world!!! I've been coming here since my parents brought me as a baby. We always order the barbecue shrimp appetizer and then I STILL usually order the barbecue shrimp entree after that hehe. Last time we were here the kitchen was nice enough to serve me pasta with the entree rather than rice. Cajun Queen has a special place in my heart and childhood and always will."}
{"text":"I wasn't much impressed with Cajun Queen during my first visit, mostly because of the indifferent service and average food. The food was just ok -- nothing was really bad or good. The seafood gumbo was pretty tasteless and was probably the worst thing we tried all night. The blackened pork tenderloin was the best, but the meat was slightly overcooked. The fried green tomatoes and Cajun crawfish poppers were both just so-so. They were both lathered in a heavy cream sauce that would have been better served on the side. The crawfish etoufee was very spicy and the crawfish were plentiful and well-cooked, but the meal just did not wow me. Service, by far, was the worst we have experienced at ANY restaurant in Charlotte. Our server was very rushed and hardly gave our table any attention. Not once did he ask if I wanted another cocktail, even though i gulped the first one down in about ten minutes. I guess he figured that people would keep coming to this place (as evidenced by the long waits, even with reservations), and he did not have to do much to keep them coming back. The nicest part of this restaurant is the atmosphere - it is located in an old house and has quite a bit of charm. They also have a live band on Saturdays (and I think other days of the week as well).  I just don't think these things are good enough to make me want to return."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews of this restaurant, I was really looking forward to eating here.  Some things were very good and others were not.  For appetizers, our group ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes and the BBQ Shrimp, which were both delicious.  The BBQ shrimp is probably what they are best known for and it is the best thing we ate all night.  It is quite spicy though so, if heat in what you eat isn't your thing, you will want to skip this dish!  I have tried Fried Green Tomatoes several times at other restaurants and just hadn't found any that I liked.  These were absolutely delicious though and I highly recommend them!  For my entrée, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  I am a huge fan of grits and cook them often at home.  I prefer grits to be creamy.  These were more watery and it seemed like they were cooked in chicken broth.  They were also not quite done enough to my liking.  The shrimp and sausage included with the grits were both dry and I just didn't care for this dish at all. For dessert, I ordered pecan pie and my husband got the bourbon bread pudding.  His was MUCH better.  The pecan pie was lacking something in the flavor department where the bread pudding just hit the mark on every level.

Overall, I would go back here again but would stick to the tomatoes and the bbq shrimp!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Great building, live music, and service. Had the fried green tomatoes (yum) followed by the Chicken tortellini and the sirloin.  Will be back again"}
{"text":"Always good food. Rustic Cajun feel inside. Love the live music. Staff is always friendly. Menu is good but does not change often."}
{"text":"I had a very nice meal and the entertainment was great.  This place is a Charlotte classic and always a fun time."}
{"text":"It was a great experience. The service was great, as all the servers check on you as they're passing by to ensure you are doing okay with your appetizers, drinks, and entrees. My family and I had dinner here for Mother's Day and we were not disappointed. We had Cajun fried oysters, yummy, Diane Chicken and Shrimp, Cajun pasta, and shrimp scampi. Delicious"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the bar upstairs. The BBQ shrimp app is amazing. Save the sauce from it to and dip your bread in it. Bartenders are great and mingle well socially with customers. Makes it feel like home."}
{"text":"This is a place that has earned my business for a long time to come after just one visit.  I will be back next time I pass through Charlotte.  Two friends had recommended this place for a business dinner and it did not disappoint.

I brought a potential client here for a laid back, quiet dinner where we could talk and enjoy ourselves and it did not disappoint.  The staff was very patient while we waited for our guest to arrive.

We started with the New Orleans bbq shrimp which were expertly prepared in a not too sweet but slightly spicy sauce.  My party devoured this dish and raved about it.  I then had a bowl of gumbo which came with my meal.  I ordered it sans rice and again, an award winning dish.  Spicy and loaded with seafood, veggies, and sausage.  I could have eaten an entire bowl of this for my meal alone!  Next was the blackened, 14 oz. NY strip steak.  Simply stated, this was HEAVEN!  By far the best NY strip I've had in years!  Perfectly seasoned, cooked, and very, very tender.  I'd eat this meal a million times over.

Now to the staff.  Very attentive and paitent and they gave us plenty of time to talk and relax over coffee at the end of the night.  We talked so long they restaurant had closed and the staff had begun their cleanup duties yet never once asked for us to leave, not even subtle hints like raising the lights.  They let us just sit and talk and talk and talk.

The dress in my opinion varies.  We were in jeans and button downs while some others had sport coats on.  A really good vibe and I'd feel just as comfortable dressed either way.  You will not be disappointed if you spend a nice evening here for your next meal!"}
{"text":"We are in shock. This place is the best hidden gem in Charlotte. I found the Groupon and thought, why not... WE WILL NOW BE REGULARS! I truly can not get over how fantastic the food was. The signature drinks were also phenomenal but this place is a must visit. It is located in a quaint house in Elizabeth and is truly the most unique atmosphere. Great photos of New Orleans on the walls and the staff is extremely attentive. We unfortunately did not get to sit upstairs and experience the live music but we will definitely be requesting a seat upstairs next time. 

The meal was great. The fried oysters were fresh, delicious, flaky, not over battered and truly perfect. I then had the cesear salad and my guy had the gumbo. They were both gone in minutes. The cesear dressing is definitely made in house, great flavor, and the gumbo was perfectly spiced and delicious. Our meals were also phenomenal... I had the duck over crawfish etoufee and holy cow was the duck perfect. We also ordered the chicken etoufee... I truly can not stress enough how perfectly spiced these dishes were. I grew up in a large Cajun household and this was honestly better than the etoufee my grandmother made. 

Unreal. We will be back AND SOON!

Thank you for a lovely and unexpectedly delicious meal."}
{"text":"Went last night for my birthday. Really good food - got the cajun pasta which was a special that day. Great atmosphere... we sat downstairs as there's a band upstairs. Seems like there was a disconnect between the hostess and the waitress as my mom called ahead asking what they did for birthdays and the hostess said \"you get the bourbon bread pudding with a candle brought to you after you're done with your dinner (for free\". But the waitress asked us well after we were done eating and boxed up our food what dessert we wanted... besides that it was a great time. Definitely worth going to for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The only thing I get here is the pork tenderloin which I LOVE every time. Very consistent! Prices are expensive and service is not very friendly.  Environment is charming! Love the old house."}
{"text":"So I had the bayou platter with fish, oysters, shrimp, scallops, and beans and rice. It was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that they put my fish directly on top of the beans which made it soggy on the bottom. The service was really great also. I had a cherry margarita which was super tasty. I'd definitely try this place again and recommend it to anyone looking for some cajun cuisine."}
{"text":"While parking can be scarce, the food, atmosphere and service easily make up for any trouble. The fried oysters are amazing! The Frieda Rita is my favorite margarita. And the Diane, etoufee, and creole are my favorite menu options. One of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Authentic New Orleans flavor and great family atmosphere.  Not pricey, and the portions are huge.  The fish is fresh, and the service is friendly.  Live music some nights."}
{"text":"You know, I contemplated giving Cajun Queen 5 stars but it just doesn't hold up to some of the best meals of my life in New Orleans.  I don't know if that's even fair, considering I grew up in Pensacola - 2 hrs outside NOLA - and Cajun Queen is better than any place there.  I also lived in Texas - another border state - and never found anything at NOLA's level.

Cajun Queen is a classy spot without being too expensive, and has a few items I really like.  

The complimentary french bread with olive oil and herbs is better than you'd expect.  Take this tip - get the \"New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp\" as an appetizer.  The bread is phenomenal dipped in the shrimp sauce.  As far as entrees are concerned I recommend the crawfish etouffée, creole chicken, or the blackened ribeye."}
{"text":"Went during the restaurant week and wasn't disappointed. I had the shrimp and grits with andouille sausage and a small bowl of gumbo.  The gumbo was a little hot (seasoning hot) but not too much.  The Shrimp & Grits were excellent as well.  The live jazz by the 3 senior citizens was excellent as well.  Overall everything was great and we'll go back again."}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Not only is their food super delicious, in a quaint neighborhood with lots of charm, but their prices are incredibly reasonable. It is located in a beautiful house and always filled with diners. Make a reservation Friday and Saturday evenings! I love their Diane and Etoufee. It is good with any of their meat choices, but I like it with all four. Their is chicken...two good sized pieces, shrimp, crawfish, and andouille sausage. For me, that is enough for at least two meals. The shrimp appetizer is really good too! The servers are really nice and charming, and your glass will never go empty. Cajun Queen is a winner!"}
{"text":"Good New Orleans food but a little bit over priced.  I would definitely try it once. Make reservations and ask for upstairs seating near the live music...which they have playing each day of the week. The drinks were excellent and the fried fish made the trip worth it."}
{"text":"Food is always great and service is good! Best brunch in Charlotte. My son loves the beignets and they sell out quick..."}
{"text":"Reservations at 5:30 on a Saturday and it was packed. Somewhat slow on the intro and our hipster server pretty much asked our drink, appetizers and entrees at once. 

Fried pickles were great as were the fried green tomatoes and fried oysters (get a half portion). 

Entrees were just ... Blah. Creole tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes. Étouffée was bland as well as the pasta special. I swear they must have ran out of salt and spice. It was just embarrassing to New Orleans. We ate there some time ago but they just threw three strikes for us. 

The bread pudding was good. 

So, good going to the apps, smack the chef and kudos to the desserts."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this restaurant on 3/22/17. Cute little place.  I had the Fried New Orleans platter with the gumbo to start.  The gumbo smelled absolutely awesome! It had a little spicy kick but some how there was no flavor.  Very odd.  I received my entrees and it was beautifully presented. The smells were amazing. The fish looked like it was fried to perfection. The taste of everything was extremely disappointing.  No flavor what so ever.  The red beans from the red beans and rice were canned kidney beans with no not a sprinkle of seasoning. The catfish was beautiful. It looked like it was going to be crispy. It was not. One good thing is that you receive a good amount of food. But for the price, its definitely not worth it because the food isnt great at all. I will probably not return"}
{"text":"The Cajun Queen is my goto restaurant for Cajun cuisine in Charlotte. The service is always friendly and helpful. I'm usually a Shrimp Etoufffee guy but also like the Washday Blues. My wife and duaghter prefer the Diane toppping to their shrim or chicken as they like a little less spice. Good brews in bottle or draft and a nice wine list. The key lime is my dessert of choice!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed our visit. The atmosphere was perfect for a family gathering. I really like that there was reasonably priced options for the children. I had the Cajun pasta and enjoyed it very much. Service was great. I also like that tip was figured into the bill."}
{"text":"Very quaint location and decor! Just me on a Monday night. Sat upstairs at the bar and had a very nice experience with live music and a very friendly bartender."}
{"text":"Crawfish is always good. They open at 11am on Sunday for brunch. Price Avg $10-13. The only thing I don't like about Cajun Queen is their tables are too close to each other but they always have a full house that explain why they need so many tables. I hope they will move to a bigger place in the future."}
{"text":"A solid spot. This is one of my fiancé's favorite places in Charlotte. We've tried various things - BBQ shrimp, chicken diane, pork chop, fried fish... it's all been great! We often find the gumbo kinda bland but it's nothing that we can't spruce up with hot sauce, salt and pepper. Service is consistently good, as well. 

The only negative about this spot is how they seat people. There have been a few times when we've come when it hasn't been busy but they always seem to put us at tiny two people tables, crammed next to other couples. I get it - they want larger tables for larger parties but if it isn't crowded, why cram the customers who are there into small tables?!?

Note #1: we never come without the Groupon. It's a great deal. They have signs everywhere that say you must wait 24 hrs after purchasing the Groupon to use it so get it at least a day before you plan on coming.

Note #2: on an awkward date or don't really like the person you are with? Ask to eat upstairs - the band (which is awesome) is so loud that it's impossible to carry on a conversation. Me? I love talking to my fiancé (corny but true) so I prefer to sit downstairs. The music is so loud that we can still hear it but we can also hear each other."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also delicious

For my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, \"Slow down, it's not going anywhere!\" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).

Unfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol."}
{"text":"A litle more upscale Cajun joint, but good. They have live music during the weekend upstairs and their bar is nice. On a beautiful day you can sit out on one of their 2 decks. One on the main floor and the other on the 2Nd floor. 

The steaks are great here, but make sure you try the BBQ shrimp appetizers and fried oysters. The BBQ shrimp is not your typical BBQ. It is hot and more of a broth base that is perfect to dip with the hot rolls. 

Oysters are also lightly fried and not greasy, so enjoy without worrying about your waist."}
{"text":"Best upscale restaurant in charlotte in my opinion for a few reason. 1. Live Jazz 2. Friendly and consistent servers 3. Food is to DIE for if you don't get the crawfish scampi appetizer your crazy it has about 75 crawfish tails. BBQ shrimp is also referred to as Crack due to how addictive they are 4. Food never changes same dishes for years now. Only complaint is sitting close to one another due to relatively packed seating but I can't blame them for maximizing profits. It's a little pricey but will turn into your anniversary/birthday go to place"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food for Sunday brunch. We had the Fried Green Tomatoes, shrimp and grits and the omelet. Then had the bourbon pecan pie. Everything can out quickly and the service was great. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We liked it enough to bring friends on our second visit.

Ambiance: 3 stars 
First off, I find this place to be unique as its in an old home that's been converted to a restaurant.  The space between tables and the table tops are small and the noise level is load. I suggest a reservation if you don't want to wait along time to be seated.  It's quaint.

Food: 4 stars 
The four of us had three rounds of Shrimp and grits and one dish of the vegetarian plate (not on the menu, special request).  We all agreed, the grits had a very good taste with the cheese and creole sauce but they were a little runny this time around.  We all enjoyed the andouille sausages, but the blackened grilled shrimp had a taste to it that we couldn't make out, and didn't enjoy.  I ate 3 of 8 and left the rest, same for my wife.  Our guest ate his but kept making a comment that he couldn't identify the odd taste. 

Service: 5 stars 
Our waiter was friendly but distant, apologized if he had to interrupt our conversation and was quick to keep our drinks filled.  Plates were quickly cleared and food came to us hot.  

Extras:
Valet parking is free, but bring a few bucks tip."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on the night of Feb 28th. The restaurant is in a converted old house. We tied a few of the appetizers. All very good. I had the Etouffee with all 3 options, Chicken, Shrimp and Crawfish. Very good. I am looking forward to the chance to go here again."}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better... great cajun food, great staff, fun locale, and voodoo beer. Throw in some live music and it makes a fun summer night dinner! Been around forever... that should tell you something!"}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is in a beautiful location. The large house is very quaint with windows so clean they appear transparent. The hostess was well dressed, helpful and charming. It was a Friday night and the place was packed with families as well as couples on a date night.Free valet parking is awesome. But unfortunately, that is were it ends. I write this in hopes of spurring change. The food was painfully bland and the rolls were cold. My husband and I tried the gumbo first. While the taste of the herbs rang through, it just didn't have that, \" started with the heads and tails of the shrimp to make my own home made broth taste\", that I would expect from a restaurant that markets like an authentic Cajun restaurant and charges the prices that you do. Same with the Shrimp and Grits-bland. The lack of salt would be understandable, if you were living in a nursing home. The mashed potatoes were over cooked and tasted like they had been whipped with water and the Diane sauce was runny. Sad. I feel cheated. I was my birthday and I picked the restaurant and was there with my entire family and everyone had that, \" I wish we had went somewhere else look,\" as the food started to arrive and I can not blame them.  The only saving grace to the entire meal was the pork chops and the fact that the veggies were fresh. When I pay these prices I want to taste the balance of flavors in what I am eating. I want it to taste like home cooked and the food needs to be hot not warm. It is like the food is being cooked with fear-like you might offend the elderly or someone who doesn't like garlic or a little heat. Why have a Cajun restaurant? Yes, I have high standards. You are what you eat and there are tons of other restaurants in Charlotte. The quality for the price is just not there."}
{"text":"Food:  
Fried Oysters were nice and crispy on the outside and delightfully gooey on the inside.. The perfect spice for both the oysters and the shrimp.  On the main course... Lay down a bed of rice, throw some \"jerk like\" chicken and two different kinds of red bean delicousness and BAM... You are set!   Now, I like my food to have a KICK but this was, what I would call, a controlled KICK.  Just enough spice to get the tongue and mouth salivating and begging for more.  You could always add some more Louisiana hot sauce if you wanted.  Then, to top it off.... bread pudding.. Oh Lordy Lord Lord, the bread pudding.. SOOOOOooo good.  I would go back just for the bread pudding.  

Atmosphere/Staff:  
Bo, the bartender made a mean Hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful.  Everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely decorated and made you feel comfortable and relaxed.  The upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy touch.  Overall, simply wonderful.  

Please give it a try.. You wont regret it.   

Enjoy

-Ian M."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!! I don't recommend it and I would never go back. The barbecue shrimp and the etouffee were way over spiced, I don't mean spicy hot, it tasted like some one made a mistake and put too much herbs. The same goes for the gumbo. The pecan pie was absolutely terrible, it was nuked and soggy, the crust was wet with no taste and the pecans were ruined because the pie had been nuked. The fried green tomatoes tasted like they were previously frozen. The service was okay, it was clear they wanted us out as soon as possible. Trust me, don't waste your money, there are better places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I planned a brunch for my future daughter-in-law, and it turned out perfect having it here. The food was great, the staff was very accommodating and friendly. Couldn't have asked for a better experience!"}
{"text":"The fried platter was amazing.  The seasoning in the batter was very tasty and the batter was light and crispy at the same time.  The catfish was tender and juicy.  We also had the grilled salmon with the crawfish sauce and it was good not great that's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.  The salmon was a little over cooked.  But in their defense, the salmon is usually blackened and we asked for grilled in order to cut back on the spicy ness.  But overall the food was great."}
{"text":"We came here because we found a Groupon for it and were very impressed. The restaurant is in an old house and is really unique. We ate upstairs on a balcony which was really nice. We got BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer and Shrimp Creole and Shrimp/Chicken/Crawfish Diane for our entrees. The servings were huge and we ended up having enough for lunch the next day. Everything was delicious and I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Anything but impressed... food was ok.. But not great and comparing it to new orleans or louisiana is an insult.. im writing this review as i am actually in the restaurant!! Decided to eat at bar upstairs was not greeted.. flloor manager i guess didn't even say hello.. he just handed me menu.. on the other hand the bar tender was nice.. she spoke a few times and after i received my food.... nada!!  I had shrrimp scampi which i could tell the shrimp was fresh.. something was missing!! I think it was the garlic... had the crawfish etoufee and the roux was bitter!! Im like wth?? With that being said i decided not to have the dessert.. oh and another thing the representation of new orleans or cajun was not present in the staff that works here.. people that are creole are naturally warm and welcoming!!  grade C"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Cajun Queen in years but returned yesterday. The building needs major renovations - I know it is in an old historical building, but some upkeep is expected. Upon parking in the back and approaching the building l was hit with an awful smell - much like you would expect from the alleys in New York. Upon entering the restaurant the interior needs to be gutted and redone. It smells musty and is very dark. The food and service were decent but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant.  The creole was excellent, the Cajun shrimp and gumbo had a spicy kick to it but not overpowering.  We enjoyed the bread pudding for desert."}
{"text":"About me: I'm a foodie. I love New Orleans/Cajun/Creole cuisine. I've traveled all over the country and see food as an experience. 

Restaurant/Staff:
Awesome Experience! My boyfriend and I celebrated my birthday last night and the staff of Cajun Queen definitely made it a night to remember. We were greeted upon arrival. I wanted to enjoy the live jazz and asked if we could be seated upstairs, the hostess had no issue accommodating this request. Within minutes we were greeted by our waiter. He was so polite, sweet and attended to each of the guest with the same care. Service and music were superb. 
Before leaving the band/staff and guest sang Happy Birthday. 

Food: I honestly can't say enough about how good the food was. The Diane w/ all three meats (crawfish, shrimp and chicken) *dramatic pause*... is in my top 5 of incredible dishes. Honestly, the garlic butter sauce wrapped me like a warm blanket. The portion was appropriate for the price and I didn't feel slighted. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and really enjoyed that as well. 

Drink: 
I ordered the Hurricane and it was definitely worth the price. They didn't hold back on the alcohol. 

Parking: Do NOT park behind the salon!! Use the valet or park across the street."}
{"text":"I'm not from New Orleans, and I have no idea what good Cajun food is supposed to taste like. Having said that, what I do know is the difference between Bad food, So-so food, and Good food.. and the food at Cajun Queen is definitely in the Good food category. I was there over the weekend, and got to try the BBQ shrimp, seafood gumbo (appetizers) and the étouffée (entree). Yes, we got a little greedy and tried the étouffée not just with chicken or shrimp or crawfish, but with all three! Every dish was so full of flavor and spice - not the 'my mouth is on fire' kinda spice, but the kind that is enjoyable and goes perfectly with their sweet fruit punch rum cocktail - the hurricane. I could taste the heat in the food, and the basic, yet strong flavors of salt and black pepper, paprika,  herbs and onions, and if that's what Cajun/Creole food is supposed to taste like, I need to get down to New Orleans and indulge in some more of this amazing food! In addition to the food, the service was great and quick. The restaurant was packed, but we never found ourselves sitting around looking for our waiter. He was also kind enough to replace my cocktail when I wasn't pleased with my initial choice (I ordered a Cajun martini, and now I know that that's obviously not the kind of drink you want with spicy food :) )"}
{"text":"This is a cute home that has been converted into a restaurant. Seating is limited so reservations are highly recommended. Upstairs they have a full service bar and often live music. Great place to enjoy some jazz, gumbo and good food."}
{"text":"This is the place that you can experience great southern comfort food! It is a New Orleans style. We ordered gumbo for an appetizer. Then shrimp and grits, crawl fish and shrimp etouffee for main dishes. The gumbo was as good as I tried in New Orleans before. A bit spicy and rich! The portion of main dishes was great and the taste was even better! My craw fish and shrimp eotuffee was perfectly spiced for an authentic southern food. Loved the sauce and crawl fish was already peeled to eat. Shrimp and grits was great too. The shrimp was well seasoned and grilled perfectly. 

The service was good and we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. Will Definitely go back when I have a craving  for southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Went here with friends, celebrating a birthday.  Made a reservation, but still had a small wait for our table.  We sat in the main dining room on the right as you enter the restaurant - right by the entrance.  The tables are extremely small, and with four people, there was not enough room for drinks, water, bread, etc.  I asked to have some of the items removed, as we were not sure where they would put the food.

The food and service were very good, actually excellent.  We all decided to order something different, and because the size of the table, they would bring each dish out separately, with clean bowl and silverware - we'd all share the one dish, and then they would bring out the next.  The waiter actually put thought to the order on how to present the dishes, due to heat/spice of each dish - very well thought out.  Our server was very tentative, and again good service.  Definitely will be back, as the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp was my favorite, and then followed by the Crawfish Etoufee. Definitely need to have a reservation."}
{"text":"Go here ! This place was delicious ,  had great service , and was a cool location . All the food that we ordered was so satisfying . We started with the fried crawfish  and it was great . Our entrees were the shrimp étouffée and the blackened  salmon with broccoli instead of potatoes . The étouffée was amazing , perfect blend of spices . If you're not one for spice , maybe stray away from this one . The blackened salmon and its toppings and sauce was much more mild , but still delicious. I also had the one of the spiked coffees and it was one of my favorites , tasted yummy and woke me up . This was a great date night spot ."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The fried green tomato app was my favorite! The salad starter wasn't anything special, definitely get the gumbo. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was on point, and the atmosphere is fun.
We started with the crawfish (Cajun popcorn). They were fantastic! Then my hubs got the chicken etouffee which was delicious with a kick of spicy. I had the blackened shrimp Caesar salad ..yum!
We finished the meal with bourbon pecan pie (would get again) and bread pudding (probably wouldn't get again...and note: I love bread pudding).
The complimentary valet is great for not trying to find your own parking.
All in all ...we'd go back again."}
{"text":"We went there, for the hundredth time, but this time armed with a Groupon. The process was seamless since hey now scan the coupon at the table with their handheld device.  

The food was great!  I had shrimp and grits!  Halfway through my meal, a bug flew into my food from the light over head.  The waiter quickly removed my plate, comped my meal, and gave me a fresh plate.  I was very impressed.  

I would def go back!  Their waitstaff have certainly improved their skills with dish removal during the meal. And, they are very friendly and professional.  

Great job!"}
{"text":"The food was good,also the service, nice place to dine in but it is pricey!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the most overrated restaurant in Charlotte. I've been 3 times and I have never been impressed.  But this last time was horrible. This is the McDonald's of Cajun cuisine. Every dish we had was completely flavorless. Fortunately it was only half price because of the Groupon that I used. And even at half off it was overpriced relative the to the exceptionally low quality of the food. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Date night!  And where shall we go?  Cajun Queen of course.  This restaurant is located in a beautiful, old house on 7th Street.  Initially, we were seated in the very bright back room.  There also happened to be a ladies' holiday party, and, you know how we gals get when we are having fun.  Very loud.  
So, we asked to be moved.  We were told that there were no available tables in the other two dining rooms, but there was space on the rooftop patio.  Huh?  We didn't even know such a space existed.  It was an unseasonably warm December night, so here we go, upstairs to absolute delight!
The rooftop featured retro Christmas music, holiday lighting and a most splendiferous view.  We ordered a half order of the fried oysters to start.  They arrived crispy, with creamy Ranch dressing.  For our entrees, we both ordered the étouffée, his with crawfish, mine with vegetables.  Both needed a little salt, pepper and hot sauce, but, after a little doctoring up,  they were good.  As an aside, I have had their vegetable étouffée when it needed no adornment.  Awesome stuff.  
And now, we shall request the rooftop each time.  Weather permitting."}
{"text":"Sat upstairs with a live jazz band and had a wonderful time. Must order the BBQ shrimp (tip: dip your bread in the sauce!) and Diane style entree. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Update!  Just had my usual as discussed below- crawfish etouffee. Have to confirm my earlier review. It's just the best. Maybe my personal favorite meal in Charlotte. At least in the top 5. 

Earlier Review:
Fantastic and flavorful crawfish etouffee-  I like mine spicier than normal but it's just perfect.  Wonderfully satisfying.  A top meal to remember. 

Have been going to Cajun Queen off and on for 20 years, so it's about time for this review. Highest recommendation. Other dishes sampled and liked were the Shrimp Diane and a basic fried shrimp. 

Decent desserts too. Had the warm bourbon pecan pie (tasty but not much bourbon in it)."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Found it on Groupon and gave it a try. Drinks were perfect. Food was delicious. I will definitely be a returning customer :)"}
{"text":"I really, really don't like leaving 1 star reviews. But man oh man, this was a bad experience. 

There is complimentary valet which is a huge perk. If you choose to self park, read the signs posted so you don't get booted. Tip the valet, they hustle hard.

Me and the boyfriend had a reservation for 7 on a Friday and were running late but we were still seated pretty quickly. I will also note that we had a groupon worth $40 worth of food. 

We ordered the New Orleans BBQ shrimp for the appetizer. I know that garlic is an ingredient but I almost died. The shrimp was well cooked but it seemed like they soaked the shrimp in garlic, sautéed it in garlic, used garlic powder- the whole nine. Thank goodness that they provide complimentary bread to negate some of the garlic.

For the entrees I ordered the Etouffle all 3 (chicken, shrimp, crawfish) and the boyfriend ordered the Creole all 3. Most disappointing entrees ever because there was no seasonings. The Etouffle had heat but no flavor. At a Cajun restaurant, I should be tasting at the minimum some Old Bay seasoning and some Lawry's. The boyfriends creole was the same- bland. Needless to say we used the hell out of the salt/pepper shaker on the table. It's actually pretty sad because the meats were properly cooked but so damn bland. 

I've been to the NOLA before and loved it. I've eaten Cajun food before and loved it. I've made Cajun style foods myself at home before and loved it. Thank goodness for Groupons because I would've had to hop in the kitchen myself to show them how it's done if we paid in full. 

Service was odd. Our server was perfect at first but then it just went downhill. I was almost done eating when I got a refill of water. We didn't get checked on until we were also almost done eating. We ordered beers in cool glasses. The boyfriend wanted a second beer and the server throws a bottled beer on the table and quickly walks away...Um okay. 

I'm glad I ate here because of all the rave reviews because I wanted to try it myself but I will NEVER return. This place is borderline insulting."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was great. Service was wonderful.  The Diane was AMAZING!  My daughter had shrimp and grits. She loved it. We all had dessert, pecan pie and bread pudding was phenomenal. Great place."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp scampi which was delicious! The service was fast and our waiter was attentive and gave great recommendations. It was our first time there and we will be back for a repeat."}
{"text":"The most expertly fried seafood that I can remember, and the absolute best fried oysters that I've ever had. If they only did Cajun as good a they do seafood, I would have given them five stars."}
{"text":"Good cajun restaurant in Charlotte.  The fried oysters are out of this world!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this Restuarant with another couple, and we were pleasantly surprised. The environment with the social scene, jazz music , and the diverse make up of the crowd is what really liked. The service, food was also good we would recommend this Restuarant as a place to go."}
{"text":"Very loud, bad service, and the food doesn't met the expectations. We came w a party of 10 people, we didn't even get menus for a while, it was so loud we could hardly listen to our server. Dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time. Super disappointed"}
{"text":"Such a huge fan of this place. I visited once with a friend for her birthday, and we were both impressed. Their food is true, authentic Cajun food with the best flavors. My friend got etouffe, and it was the perfect consistency. I got cajun pasta and enjoyed every single bite. Don't forget to order a hurricane--in true New Orleans style, it was delicious. 

The restaurant itself is such a cozy environment. It's in an old house. If you're not bothered by walking around nooks and corners to get to your seat, it makes for a really comforting dining experience. It felt a little bit crowded (you sit closely to your \"neighbors\") but that doesn't bother me. Also, keep in mind that it is valet parking only. There's really nowhere else to park. Also, make a reservation if you can--it gets extremely crowded.  

Recommend this restaurant if you're looking for something unique."}
{"text":"When you first arrive, it's a quaint cute house. The ambiance was intimate yet lively. It felt divey yet, warm and upscale.

Our bartender Mel was life! She's social, has 18years of experience, and appropriate yet balances with giving you (the patron) space. The drinks were strong and compliments the vibe to enjoy the live band. 

My meal was one of those 'slap yo Mama and Grandma good! So that once they realize you've got them you force them to take a bite. Maybe it was just my meal - I probably wouldn't try this in real life, as it wouldn't end well. Leftovers wouldn't save the day either  

Digressing, I met a sweet couple who have become family friends. I witnessed a couple get engaged. I ate until I couldn't eat anymore and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great Cajun food In Charlotte.

Live Jazz Band upstairs was good, but loud if your are sitting up stairs.  

The Creole spicy  was a nice tomato base, not to spicy.  Then I had the and Etouffee spice with all 3 meats (shrimp , crawfish, and chicken).   This had some nice heat and flavor.   I was really happy with my choice.

You are looking at about $20 per plate, but the quality is really good. 

I would visit again, I just hope they fix the alligator in the food of the building which seems to have fallen over."}
{"text":"I went here Friday night as my cheat night for the diet I'm on. This was a great cheat destination! We arrived for reservations at 8:30. The place was packed! They send you upstairs to the bar to wait until your table ready and I did not even try to get a drink it was so packed. However, our table was ready soon after we arrived. Cajun Queen is in an old house in the Elizabeth community (my community) and has great ambiance. We started off with a crawfish appetizer (not the fried one) and it was delicious! I will definitely get tit again! The cucumber gin drink that was featured was also great. I got the BBQ shrimp as my main course and it was also very good. My date got the salmon special and it was great (Maybe a little better than mine, I had to try a bite!) I ended the dinner with a slice of Oreo cheesecake - yum. Overall this was a great experience and will be my destination when I want some great, spicy Cajun cuisine. (sorry Bordeaux - I won't be visiting you anymore)"}
{"text":"I haven't really had \"cajun\" food before, so when I saw an online deal for it I definitely wanted to check it out. We rarely venture outside Lake Norman and into Charlotte, but the thought of some spicy grub was enough to entice me. Man, I'm glad we went!

When we first arrived at 6pm the place was hopping. I highly recommend making reservations. As for parking, they have a complimentary valet service right next to the restaurant, so I recommend using them rather than driving around looking for street parking. The restaurant itself is a converted home, and has a great, quaint feel to it. However, the small rooms lead to tight quarters, and the neighboring tables will be in pretty close proximity to you. We ate upstairs, and if the close tables didn't make the room loud enough, the live band playing behind us aided in turning tableside conversation into a shouting match. Now this would really get on my nerves at other restaurants, but here it worked. I didn't mind the music, and had no problem forgoing conversation for a bit while enjoying the ambiance of the little room and smooth music. Also, they only played about four songs or so, and took a five minute break in between each, so it wasn't a constant barrage of noise.

Our server was quick and efficient, and our food was brought out in a timely manner despite the bustling customer count. For once I did have a cocktail rather than beer or wine, mainly because the mixed drinks were about the same price as a glass of wine. I ordered the Lynchwood Lemonade ($8) which consisted of Jack Daniels, Triple Sec and lemonade. It was a nice, strong drink and went great with the meal and music. The missus ordered a melon martini that she enjoyed quite a bit. It wasn't too sweet and still had a good kick to it.

After placing our orders some complimentary bread was brought over, which consisted of three rolls. These things might have well been hockey pucks based on how flavorless and hard they were. I think they might have fallen off the \"bread pudding\" rack and into the \"fresh daily rolls\" basket because there was no way these things should have been served as they were.

For dinner I ordered the steak special of the day ($24). It came with salad or gumbo, and I went with the salad. Big mistake, because all I got was a bowl with chunks of romaine, a slice of cucumber and some shredded carrot. The vinaigrette that came with it was extremely potent and way too strong. After picking at this salad the main course showed up, which was a 10oz sirloin, crawfish etouffee, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was cooked to order, and despite it being a large (as in tall) cut of meat it was still tender. The blackened seasoning rub added a good deal of spice and flavor to the beef, and I was quite a fan. I was equally happy with the crawfish etouffee, especially since I've never had crawfish before. The etouffee consisted of peeled, small crawfish pieces (smaller than popcorn shrimp) tossed with veggies in a dark, spicy sauce. I really liked the crawfish, which tasted more like lobster than shrimp, and the spice level was perfect...not too much where I couldn't eat it but enough that I felt it after each bite. The mashed potatoes were decent, but nothing out of this world. The broccoli was done kind of poorly, as it was just some huge hunks of slightly steamed broccoli. While the sides and salad were nothing spectacular, the entree was one heck of a spicy, tastetacular bite.

The missus' went with the  Crawfish Diane ($18.95) and enjoyed it as well. The Diane was done in a lighter sauce that was not as spicy as the etouffee, so if you want something that's a little milder this would be the dish. This was her first bite of crawfish too and really enjoyed it. The Diane had a little more substance in that it added rice to the protein and veggie mixture, and there was so much that she had leftovers for lunch the following day. While it was tasty, I thought it was just a bit bland compared to the etouffee.

We ended up splurging for dessert when we saw they offered bread pudding, which has become something we can't pass up when dining out. Cajun Queen makes one heck of a Bourbon Bread Pudding (5), and if you are a fan of bread pudding you shouldn't pass this up. The dessert came in a decent-sized ramekin and was filled with this warm treat. The bread pudding had chunks of peach and raisen going through it, and they became hot and gooey from the heat of the bread pudding. It had great taste and texture, with a nice crust on top. There was also a pile of whipped cream and caramel drizzled across the crust, making the dessert a visual and edible offering. 

Cajun Queen dishes out some great grub. While some things can be improved upon (sides and rolls), the stuff that counts is pretty banging. Our entrees were delicious and the cocktails were done well. This is one of those places that we will definitely be bringing friends and family to when they visit from out of town."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to go to Cajun Queen for a long time.  The stars finally aligned, and we went - with great anticipation.  It was a letdown.  I could explain by making this a long review, but I'll sum it up this way:  The entrees are on one setting: smokin'.  I like it hot, so my etoufee was pretty good.  My wife doesn't, and she tried to play it safe with a \"mild\" one - the barbecue shrimp.  It was smokin'.  Further, it was identical to the etouffee, except it was more like just a soup with some rice - and the tails still on the shrimp.  With every facial orifice unexpectedly on fire, she sent it back.  They charged us for both the offending volcano and the replacement.  Really?  So I would recommend CQ as a decent place if all in your party like it hot.  If anyone is cayenne-intolerant, split up and send them elsewhere.  And if you send something back, don't expect them to take it off your bill."}
{"text":"I came here because I got a Groupon and I kept hearing about them so I finally got the chance to give them a try. When my niece and I came it was after the snow storm so it was a little bit slick outside and it was really cold. I love the fact that they have valet. When we walked in we were greeted and asked where we would like to sit either downstairs or upstairs with the band. I really wanted to sit by the band but once we got upstairs we realized how congested it was and quickly changed our mind and opted to sit downstairs. The ambiance was very nice and I liked the salt and pepper grinder. The fire place was lit and I could still hear the band playing upstairs but there was a draft coming in from the window. For appetizer I ordered the fried green tomatoes. They were okay just a little bit too firm for me. I ordered the all three Dianne with a side salad. I will say that the food was good but very under seasoned. I had to really season my food once I got home. My niece ordered the chicken, mashed potatoes and broccoli. She didn't say anything about the seasoning but I guess to each its own. I am still a fan and I would definitely come back and try some other things I would just ask them for extra seasoning on my food. Something that I definitely don't think that I should have to request at a place with Cajun in the name."}
{"text":"Date Night at Cajun Queen was delectable!  My husband had the shrimp 'n grits and I enjoyed the étouffée! We were running 5 mins behind, but we were still seated within 5 minutes of our arrival.  Highly recommend for date night!  If you're looking for the live jazz atmosphere, be sure to request this when making your reservation.  Thanks, Fernando!  Your service was just right."}
{"text":"The service is always impeccable, the excellent live jazz that's present upstairs daily, and obviously the most important part -- the never disappointing food which led me back to what may have been my 10th time dining at Cajun Queen. I moved to Washington D.C. about two years ago and every opportunity I have to come back to Charlotte, I make sure to include Cajun Queen on that itinerary. 

My buddy had the blackened catfish with garlic mashed potatoes and the seasonal topping of the day and I had to stick with my personal fav, the chicken based étouffée served over rice. It's so rich with flavors, a good amount of spice, and just the right size for a hearty meal. 

Thank you Cajun queen for never disappointing."}
{"text":"Good food usually very consistent....Great bbq shrimp. Seating can be tight."}
{"text":"Pro's - Great service. Great atmosphere. Good food. 

Cons: Poor parking and the seating is a bit cramped. My wife and I were sat in a corner against the wall & very close to another couple. They were very nice people but sitting that close to other people makes it tough to have a private conversation. The food was good but also a bit too spicy for my liking...even for Cajun food. My wife had the Cajun pasta and I had the crawfish étouffée. Both had GREAT flavor but were also VERY spicy."}
{"text":"The ambience and view from the first floor were nice. The New Orleans B.B.Q shrimp appetizer was very tasty and presented well. It is unfortunate this was by far the best part of our meal. My wife got the creole with chicken, shrimp and crawfish but it was average. I got the etouffe with chicken, shrimp and crawfish but it was not as flavorful as etouffes I had in the past. We also got the toll house cookie pie and it was not a chocolate chip cookie pie as we thought it would be. If we went back, it would only be for the appetizer."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar upstairs and had a delicious bowl of Crawfish Etouffee added shrimp and sausage which was an excellent combination. The bar tender was very attentive and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I have been in Charlotte for over three years and had never been to Cajun Queen, but I have been listening to Jazz a lot lately and got in the mood for some live Jazz. From what I have been able to find, this is the only place in Charlotte that even has live Jazz, so I booked a reservation (through OpenTable) for my girlfriend and I on a Saturday night.

No problems with the reservation or getting us seated as soon as we got there, but I was immediately disappointed to find out that the music was only upstairs and there would be a \"20-30 minute wait\" for seating upstairs. We were seated downstairs, right next to the entrance--it's not great seeing everyone come and go, as well as the staff milling about the hostess stand.

Our dinner started with no live Jazz (from downstairs it sounded like pots/pans being banged together) and less than ideal seating. Then came the food. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special. Certainly not good enough to warrant all of the rave reviews here or the prices they charge. It was seasoned, but still tasted very bland to me, especially the crawfish, which I thought was overcooked. The seasoning certainly did not taste Cajun to me. (I got the crawfish Creole and my girlfriend had the chicken Etouffee.)

I was definitely not pleased with my first--and last--experience at Cajun Queen, and left $60 poorer and hungry for better food, although I was full. Given that \"Live Jazz 7 nights a week\" is prominently touted on their website header, they really need to specify that it is only upstairs. I would have requested upstairs seating when I made the reservation, if I had known that was the only place to hear the music. Either that, or they need to remodel that old, bland house to open it up more.

Bottom line: I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Tried to use Groupon, but it was denied due to way too small of a use window.  Food was OK, but very expensive.  Shame on Cajun Queen and shame on Groupon for not allowing a reasonable time window to use the coupon.  Not going back.  This was a real jerk move on their part.  This was our first visit after living in Charlotte for 20+ years.  I guess they didn't want a return visit."}
{"text":"Came here for my wife's birthday one year - had great food and the live jazz is a great plus."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favs. Loved the gumbo, grits, and creole shrimp. Live jazz was the cherry on the sundae. Speaking of desserts, I remember being pleasantly surprised with the bourbon pecan pie."}
{"text":"So I have been putting Cajun Queen off for sometime now but after I kept hearing online others raving about how good the food was I said eh lets go. So myself and others headed out here yesterday. One thing I love is their is complimentary parking here we were panicking when we first arrived thinking we were not going to be able to find a park ,but to our surprise they had valet service. I feel Cajun Queen has a very intimate setting. Also if you looked around that's all we really seen was couples sitting around gazing in each others eyes and such. They did a very good job with bringing that New Orleans Vibes to Cajun Queen far as decorating goes, real laid back setting with Jazz music playing and mardi gras beads everywhere from outside in the grass to hanging over the ceiling fans I thought that part was pretty cool. Now I can't say the same about the food. Our food was okay, I was expecting so much more I feel like what I ordered wasn't that flavor filled as it should be. I ordered the Crawfish scampi with rice, my mother ordered the half half deal half fried shrimp and half fried oysters, she complained about her broccoli being pretty tough but she didn't want to make a fuss so she just left on the plate. What I will say is for an appetizer we ordered the fried green tomatoes and those were to die for !!!!! Not sure what type of sauce those tomatoes were drenched in but I'm definitely going back just for the green fried tomatoes I want to give them another try all in all ."}
{"text":"Oh yeah.  I was there in the late 90s and loved it. 
My first trip back to Charlotte in 15 years and this place was my first stop. 
Excellent meal, especially the crawfish appetizer.  No way I wait that along again before getting back out there!"}
{"text":"I love Cajun Queen!! I have been here several times and I will continue to go for the ambience, great cocktails, and fantastic food!!!
The fried green tomatoes are prob the best I have ever had.  The 7th street stumbler is an awesome cocktail!! Not to sweet, but still slightly fruity. I could have easily drank a few of these but I stuck to one. Ordered the Catfish, if you like spicy you would enjoy this...it's awesome.

The reason I give this place a 4 and not a 5 is because of the service we experienced last time we were there. Our waiter was AWFUL, extremely rude -- prob the worst service I have got in a restaurant in years.  He rarely came by to ask if we needed anything, didnt clear our appetizer plates and we were sitting at a small two top. When we were finished, we waiting around for 25 minutes for him to show up. When he did finally show up he threw our check back at us without saying a word.
The ONLY reason I left a tip was bc I use to be a server and even tho he was horrendous, I still can't bring myself to leave a person no tip.

Anyways, the bad service I experienced the one time I went here will not keep me from going here.  Love Cajun Queen!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this restaurant. Its a unique atmosphere being in a old house. The place was packed the night we went. You definitely need a reservation here on the weekend. We arrived a few minutes early, and were directed upstairs to the bar area. This area was packed and there was a small band playing blues/jazz. It was a great vibe, great atmosphere. I hated to leave there, when our table was ready. But alas, we were called away to a downstairs table. Downstairs, I could no longer hear the band. However, we ordered the special for the night. They had several different kinds of fish, with several different cajun toppings. The food was plentiful and fantastic. This place just has a lot of character and thus it makes a great place for a date night. I probably wouldn't bring the kids here, because they wouldn't appreciate it. But a great place for a nice couples night out, or a dinner date with friends."}
{"text":"Cajun Queen is a must if you are in the Charlotte area. It came highly recommended. It is located in a old renovated home, there is a bar and live music to go along with the amazingly delicious cuisine. 

For starters, the drinks are strong, the fried pickles are awesome and the service was stellar. The staff is extremely friendly and peppy and service fast. I ordered the Diane with chicken, shrimp and crawfish and it was incredible, authentic and out of this world!

I wholeheartedly recommend Cajun Queen to anyone visiting Charlotte or any locals who are living under a rock. :)"}
{"text":"We finally made our way to CQ after living down the road for nearly two years. Full disclosure, I'm not a huge fan of Cajun food, Let's say my stomach isn't a huge fan. With that said, I had bought a living social and few months back and we needed to use it. I made reservations for Sunday evening and we were seated right away. We were right next to the band and a Really large, loud group. That wasn't a problem, this isn't a quiet restaurant and the sever and party apologized for being so loud. If you sit downstairs it is not as loud, 

I got the shrimp and grits, Col got the BBQ shrimp both really good and they give you a lot of shrimp. We took two slices of pecan pie to go. Everything was great. Our Server Alex, was on top of it and friendly even when they were really busy. It's a nice spot to go for a fun evening or if you're in the mood for something a little different."}
{"text":"Delicious!

I've been here twice, once for brunch and once for dinner and I thought it was great both times.  At dinner I ordered the blackened chicken and tortellini special and it was great, only complaint was there werent enough tortelliini but it was made up by the overabundance of chicken.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken diane and it was amazing, I was torn as to which dish I enjoyed more.  Service was great and the food came out blazingly fast."}
{"text":"I have been telling my wife that we have to get back to New Orleans just for the food. I don't have to ask that anymore. This place is amazing!!! We were we in town for a panthers game and saw this place. My entire party loved it. The whole experience was amazing.  And the food was the star. Definitely coming back !!! Do urself a favor and stop by..you'll be glad u did"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a lot of Cajun Restaurants (yet), but this has hands down been my favorite. Pulling up it looks like a old historic house. I'd never eaten in a restaurant like this so I was excited to get inside. When you pull in, they have complimentary valet. They work really hard so I always make sure I have cash to tip them. One weekends you have to have a reservation as they are normally booked to capacity. Immediately at the door they have someone waiting to seat you. And inside, the layout is just like a house! I love it!! Tables are spacious and the atmosphere is very nice. I've eaten upstairs once and I will never do it again. The reason is because they have a band upstairs every night. While the music is nice, it is loud. I left with a headache that one time from trying to yell over the music along with all the other conversations going on as the bar is upstairs as well. Downstairs you can still hear the music so I prefer to eat there. I've never had a rude server. They are always so nice. I've tried a little bit of everything here, and the only thing that I can say left me something to be desired was the BBQ Shrimp. Not that flavorful, wasn't really exciting, I'll pass on that from now on. The popcorn Crawfish is soooo good! So tender! They just melt in your mouth. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp scampi. While it was delicious!! It was pretty much shrimp served in a soup of oil and butter. Was wayyy too much! And the seafood Gumbo is really good. It has a small kick of heat and you'll get a couple shrimp in it if you're lucky. My favorite meals are the All 3 Diane and the Special where you pick your fish and either Shrimp or Crawfish topping. Just about everything is served over rice but I prefer Mashed Potatoes. And the hands down best dessert there is the Bourbon Pecan Pie!!! OMG!!!!!! Just think 21 Jump Street in my mouth!! So delicious! We thought the bread pudding was pretty bland though. Not much going on flavor wise, which was disappointing because I was excited to try it. Overall this place is awesome! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It is in a cute house. The ambiance was intimate but the music adds some fun!  Definitely yummy food and talented Jazz band!  Do: order the cheesecake (we had oreo), to die for!!!  Don't: get a bloody mary unless you LOVE cocktail sauce!

Overall we will be dining there again!"}
{"text":"We came in for brunch one weekend and the banana foster French toast was seriously to die for! Though the interior and decor left me expecting a bit more, the service was wonderful. I'm interested to try their dinner menu though"}
{"text":"The setting of this restaurant is great. The food is great. The live band is great. My waiter, Alex, was great. All these things that contributed to the atmosphere of this restaurant which was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Cajun Queen five stars because I have been dreaming of their pan seared duck breast over crawfish etouffee hitting my lips since the moment I left. This was indisputably the best duck I've ever eaten and the etouffee was an AMAZING accompaniment. The decor and ambiance aren't necessarily the glitz and glam you find in DC's five star restaurants but there was a true essence of NOLA permeating the air from the time we walked in. This was largely in part to their house band located on the second floor playin live music we absolutely loved. There are photos / paintings throughout the restaurant of New Orleans staples but honestly..... I enjoyed Cajun Queen's food better than most things I are while I was in NOLA. 

Fried green tomatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly and we ate every morsel on the plate.
The Fried oysters tasted phenomenal.
My gumbo was better than any gumbo I had in NOLA but I like spicy food so I added a dash oh hot sauce and sprinkle of black pepper that took it to perfection. The barbecue shrimp was out of this world, delicious. The sauce is soooooo good to sop up with the complimentary bread. Then there was this Oreo cheesecake that was one of my favorite cheesecakes I've ever tasted. Hubby thought his shrimp and grits were just ok but since our server was also pretty great, I could not find cause to deduct a star for that. 

If you're looking for a unique dining experience in Charlotte that will make you feel like you've walked right into the French Quarter of NOLA without hopping on a plane or train, Cajun Queen is not to be missed. Sit upstairs to be close to the live band and utilize their complimentary valet."}
{"text":"Incredible food. We had the bbq shrimp, etouffee 3 ways, and the diane 3 ways. I had the leftovers for breakfast this morning, couldnt resist. Our waitress, Hannah, was awesome. Cant wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Although I have passed this location on many trips to  Charlotte as well as when I lived her, today is my first time sampling the cuisine. I started with a very delicious key line Martini and the popcorn  crawfish both a sweet treat. The crawfish for sure should not be missed. Next course was a very fresh and impeccably spice cup of gumbo. For my main course I chose from the specials menu a piece of Mahi Mahi topped with shrimp taoso ham roasted red peppers and mushrooms served over garlic mashed potatoes.  The presentation was beautiful and the taste divine. All if the seafood was extremely fresh.   My husband chose this Resturant to celebrate our Anniversary and I am very pleased with his choice."}
{"text":"Best of the Best!   The Fried Oysters are to die for, and is always fried perfectly. The Shrimp & Crawfish Diane is AWESOME! The BBQ Shrimp w/ the bread is Out Of Bounds. They also have great cocktails, and a band of old guys playing some jazz on stage. The balcony is a nice place to sit.... You cannot go wrong at this place, It's A Must Visit!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Cajun/Creole food as a change of pace and Cajun Queen has always delivered a good enough version of things to keep me happy.  Absolutely adore the BBQ shrimp with the only problem being the \"gravy\" is so good that I end up eating too much bread cause I can't stop sopping it up!

The gumbo is good though on my most recent visit it could have used a bit more salt.  Same for one of the specials we ordered which was blackened mahi with a crawfish, artichoke, tomato sauce.  It was flavorful with perfectly cooked fish and very lemony artichokes though.  Also got the Etouffee (secret... you can order it 4 way where they add andouille to it to go along with the 3 way version with shrimp, crawfish and chicken).  It was really good with a perfect dark roux and just enough spice to get my forehead sweating.  The shrimp in it could be better/bigger/fresher but that's a minor thing compared to the whole of the dish.

I've had the New Orleans's seafood platter before and it's deep fried goodness to be sure.  No matter what you get, portion sizes are more than adequate.

Overall this place is not New Orleans's good, if it were, it would be getting 5 stars but it's definitely good enough for me to make it a semi-regular stop when craving those flavors."}
