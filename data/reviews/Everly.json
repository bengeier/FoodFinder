{"text":"My husband and I tried Everly last night - and we were impressed! We ordered the muscles and artichoke toast to start... both were fantastic. For dinner we ordered the salmon and butternut squash bowl and again... everything was delicious! The portions were generous, we were basically rolling out of the restaurant after licking every plate clean. The service was top-notch, we were there on one of their first nights open to the public, and our (very friendly!)server was extremely knowledgeable about the beer, wine and food. As former San Diegans, this California-style restaurant reminded us of our warmer days on the west coast. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that Bluephie's was gone until a friend invited me to check out an awesome new restaurant and I pulled into the lot to meet her. Not a problem, since Bluephie's was a bit \"meh\" IMHO. I tried Everly during restaurant week and chose a 3-course lunch: Celery Root Bisque, SoCal Grain Bowl, and Chocolate Mousse. The bisque as unexpectedly rich, decadent, and delicious. I could have just eaten that and left happy. The grain bowl was a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. Perhaps my palate is just not sophisticated enough to appreciate that particular combination of flavors: the mix of toasted oats, sunny-side-up egg (perfectly cooked, BTW), hot sauce, avocado, kale, and quinoa just didn't quite make a happy family in my mouth. The dessert was delish: although it wasn't described as such, the mousse had a delightful hit of orange flavor from the addition of orange zest, and chocolate + orange are one of the greatest flavor combos on Earth.  I had a look at the regular menu and I'm excited to come back. The prices are very reasonable, and there are a ton of really tasty-sounding, fresh, healthy dishes that I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"My son and I decided to try out this new restaurant on Monroe Street. The outdoor seating area and service for our table was fine. He ordered the salmon and an asparagus green bean side, I ordered the flat steak. When the food arrived, I thought it was a joke. A tiny piece of salmon and a wilted artesian salad with less than a shaved spear of asparagus on it. Our waitress had suggested we order a side of potatoes since she must have known the little amount of food that comes in this entree. My steak was 4 small rings layered with a sauce, and one small potatoe divided in half. This place is way overpriced for the little amount of food you get. Afterward, we went too the Laurel to get dinner."}
{"text":"Everly has the best food in town right now!!  I have eaten at Everly twice and both times it was  UNREAL!  The mushroom toast and the artichoke toasts are wonderful as is the shaved vegetable salad. The beef tartare, the pork meatballs and the fried chicken are to die for. The baked oysters are the best thing I've had in years- ANYWHERE.  I'm looking forward to trying some of the large plates but ordering the small plates enables one to try so many amazing dishes.  Move over Tory!  Oh, and don't miss the drink 'Hola from the Other Side'.   The general manager and wait staff are also exceptional in a lovely, new updated space."}
{"text":"Good selection of food and beer. Atmosphere is great, with patio seating. Dog friendly on the patio as well. Little pricey, but would recommend."}
{"text":"Everly is a terrible place... I mean a terribly  AWESOME place!!!! Logan, the bartender helped us and made excellent food and beer suggestions. We have seen the boss working hard too... He loaded a bunch of coolers by himself. I guess it's gonna be a great picnic somewhere... The food was excellent, the service was excellent, the atmosphere is excellent!!! Just travelling trough but would come back to Madison just to eat here again. Thanks guys for the great dining experience! And they are dog friendly! The patio is a great place to hang out with your pooches."}
{"text":"I was seated at the bar and ordered  the Pan Roasted Brussels Sprouts and the Seasonal Mushroom Toast. I felt the two dishes were each lacking in one area. The sauce for the Brussels Sprouts and Seasonal Mushroom were delicious. A few of the halved Brussel Sprouts were pan roasted until golden brown on one side while the remaining were burnt on one side. The burnt pieces left a bitter aftertaste that the sauce could not fully mask. The Seasonal Mushrooms were perfectly cooked however the big pieces of sourdough bread soaked up the sauce and the sourness overpowered the taste of the sauce and mushrooms. I opted to enjoy the mushrooms sans bread which was delicious. I will give this place another try since the issues were not problematic enough to deter me from trying their other dishes. Service was great. Attentive server and I received my food a little after ordering."}
{"text":"My dinner at Everly last night was extraordinary! I'm a celiac vegetarian and had so many delicious options to choose from, that my boyfriend and I ordered a spread of five different plates and shared. We were both so very pleased with every one of them. We ordered artichoke toast, brussles sprouts, squash curry, roasted squash, and eggplant couscous which they swapped out with quinoa for me to make it gluten free. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice lunch with my husband here.  The food is good and prepared very well.  We want to return soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for the first time this past weekend. Great place to enjoy a summer night with its outdoor seating and open air concept. My girlfriend got a couple of mixed drinks which she really enjoyed, and there was outdoor seating at the bar which would make a decent place to grab a drink. The food was a mixed bag. The Brussels sprouts and curry squash dish were great. However, the salmon was small and unremarkable, and the risotto was bland. Would go back to try additional menu options."}
{"text":"We found Everly to be SOSOSO disappointing! The vegetable dishes we ordered were served lukewarm. The  brussel sprouts were very flavorful but the others didn't hit the mark.  The shaved salad was inedible (someone in the kitchen must be obsessed with radishes) , though the salmon on top was delicious. The cauliflower casserole was also lukewarm and bland. The butternut squash casserole? was very tasty with a delightful crunch. The salmon entree was served way after the other entrees; poor timing. The place was clean and the servers were pleasant. All in all, we miss Bluphies and won't be rushing back to dine here."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because it sounded hip and healthy. The inside is really cute, but doesn't make up for an utterly depressing, over priced lunch. The white fish toast is actually mayo toast with white fish. And the butternut squash curry had very little butternut squash in it. The black rice served with it was stirred way too much - it was a sticky blob! Sure, the service was unbelievably fast - it took less than 10 minutes for the food to come out - but that means it's not much prep work. Which begs the question, why $13 for avocado toast? If you want to afford a house one day, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went on a week night, had the steak, everything was very good."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, and good breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is one amazing restaurant! Love their menu. It's especially fabulous if you are vegetarian or vegan or are gluten-sensitive, but meat dishes are also available and excellent. My husband had the flat iron steak and loved it, as well as the fantastic vegetarian appetizers and entree dishes that my daughter and I shared with him. We are definitely returning here frequently. One note: be sure to make a reservation - they are popular and fill up quickly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Everly tonight and had a great experience. Our server Spencer provided great service. He was warm and attentive.  Our drinks and meals were both delicious and promptly served. I will definitely be going back. Thanks Spencer!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now - the wait staff are very accommodating and there are lots of fresh and gluten-free options. A bit on the pricey side and the portions aren't overly generous. I was sad when Bluephies went away, but I actually find I like the atmosphere and food better at Everly! The only thing I regret is choosing the sea salt chocolate sorbet over the granola desert. It was a bit \"why bother\" in my opinion. Will be back, and will be ordering the hazelnut buttered squash again for sure!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: After my dad's three-star review, a manager contacted him and offered him a gift card if he'd return.  Since my dad (Chris) doesn't live in the Madison area and only came the first time to visit us who are in Madison, he accepted the gift card and gave it to us with instructions to update his review with what we found.  Me and my partner went back and were very impressed.  The service still wasn't amazing, but the food was so much better this time.  I'd happily go back, and I think I've convinced my parents to give it another try too.  This time we ordered an appetizer of baked oysters, which were really great - the oysters were fresh and tasty, and the seasoning was perfect.  My partner then ordered the beef burger which was a really good burger and came with a yummy kale salad.  I ordered the Farro Risotto (without radishes) to compare with last time.  When we ordered it last time the flavors didn't seem to work, but on this visit, the dish tasted perfect!  They put the right amount of cheese, and the wheatberries were perfectly cooked with a tiny crunch to make the dish have a variety of textures.  There was also some delicious asparagus in the dish.  The one thing that was annoying with this rendition of the dish was that there were two grilled spears of asparagus on top (clearly for aesthetics), but I would have preferred if this asparagus had been cut into smaller pieces like the rest of the asparagus in the dish.  The long spears of asparagus was annoyingly fibrous (as asparagus spears always are - you try to take a clean bite off and then you get the strings.  We also ordered the \"Hola from the other side\" cocktail which was very good, but very alcoholic.  We finished the meal off with a perfectly balanced London Fog off the desert menu (that's basically a latte with black tea instead of coffee).  At the end of our meal, our waitress got distracted and didn't bring the desert menu out for a long time and then didn't bring the bill out for another 15 minutes.  So, we were sitting there, trying to make the London Fog last.  So, the service wasn't perfect.  But, when we were leaving, a maitre d asked us how the meal was and we told him about the overly-alcoholic drink, and he was very receptive to the feedback.  Overall, I give the restaurant big props for reaching out to my dad and giving us such a generous gift certificate.  And the food on the second trip was excellent (not best in the world, but incredibly good).  I would love to go back again, although the prices are a little high for me to go back too frequently."}
{"text":"They have a solid brunch menu with some unique and tasty choices. It's also a cool atmosphere, especially in the summertime when they can open up the garage doors. The presentation of the food was spot on and the portion sizes were fair. I really liked their raspberry flavored mimosa, but it was a little bit expensive. Their cranberry brioche French toast was delicious, right down to the fluffy bread they made it with. To top it off, they have a parking lot (a rare gem in Madison). I will be adding Everly to my favorites list for brunch!"}
{"text":"Tried their brunch - had the chilaquiles and it was excellent! Want to go back soon to try the smoked salmon scramble too. Great service and the decor and vibe are awesome. Very kid-friendly for our 2 year old and he devoured the kid's French toast"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hip place with great food and cocktails, this spot is for you. I went here on a Saturday night with no reservation and they were able to accommodate us immediately. The cocktail list was unique and had many options worth trying. I had their interpretation of a boulevardier, which had a nice blend of spirits. The menu was a la carte with nicely sized entrees. The mussels here are by far my favorite in Madison, which surprised me considering the other places I have been to specifically for mussels in the area. I would go back for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be a hit and it missed the mark. Overpriced for the neighborhood and nothing was great. Everything was over salted."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and unique for madison.  Drinks were good.  Lots of options for vegetarians and pescatarians in addition to meat eaters.  We will visit again."}
{"text":"Got the mushroom toast- tasted overly salty. In addition, got the charred broccoli, which initially tasted great, but as you get towards the bottom you see and a bunch of oil and can taste the broccoli full of oil. Would come again as the atmosphere is good but this visit wasn't the best overall"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My mom and I are on the road moving from CA to the East coast and we found this place on Yelp, and it was amazing! I had the rissoto and it was vegetarian and delicious! Definitely dropping in again if I happen to be in WA!"}
{"text":"Super cute brunch spot! The space is open and airy and I imagine it'll be awesome in the summer. The bar is very pretty and the whole space feels like a place you could sit for hours in. I came here for brunch with friends and we were all happy. We started with cocktails and I chose one with champagne, fresh strawberry and lemon.. it was nice to see some unique drinks (other than a mimosa or Bloody Mary) on the brunch cocktail menu. We shared the kale toast between the 4 of us. It was nice to be able to taste it but I don't think I have a full impression of what it's like as a composed dish. It's hard to get all the components onto one small piece. What I did have was tasty, though! For my meal, I got the Benedict with smoked salmon and avocado. You have a choice of potatoes or kale. I wanted both of the sides and so I asked for the Benedict to be served without the English muffin over the potatoes with the kale salad on the side. They were happy to accommodate my request, which was awesome! The dish was fresh and yummy. The kale is a little hard to chew, so perhaps they'll make adjustments to how they serve it in the future? It could use more time in the dressing so that it has time to break down, or a light steam to soften the rawness. I personally found Bluphies to be an overpriced, greasy spoon type restaurant, so I much prefer what they're doing at Everly! I'd be happy to come back for any meal."}
{"text":"Delicious! So accommodating of different food allergies. Fried artichokes were so good!"}
{"text":"When I first stepped into this restaurant, I was amazed by the atmosphere. It has a very modern look, and it's very beautifully decorated. The service was amazing and friendly. The server recommended the salmon sandwich for lunch - it was delicious. Will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how they think it's ok to serve completely burnt brussel sprouts that were utterly inedible with completely over cooked bland salmon and nothing else for $14. They didn't even bother to put any sauce I had to sprinkle some salt which was the only seasoning I got."}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about this place and had a roommate that had been dying to try it, so I made a reservation on a Monday night for 7 people.   Service: I called several times to change the # of people and reservation. They were strict about not allowing multiple big parties which I found to be weird especially when we got there and there were a lot of empty tables with 3 servers. The service took a long time, but acceptable considering there was 7 of us.  Ambiance: Very trendy. Comfy almost office like chairs with real candles at all the tables. I think it would be really fun in the summer with it's big open bar and patio.   Food: Trendy, expensive, smaller (for America) portion sizes. I had the chicken sandwich with kale salad. The chicken was small and a little tough, but the slaw on top was delicious. A lot of my friends got the truffle fries and really liked them. The maple mustard glaze on the salmon with Brussels sprouts was to die for. They also gave us a berry/fruity compote for dessert on the house for my friends birthday."}
{"text":"This was a date night location since we had a gift card to Food Fight restaurant group and had not been here yet. I started off with a recommend cocktail from the waiter. It had matcha tea in it and was incredibly light and refreshing! Then we had the brussel sprouts as an appetizer. They were flavored well and had nice crispy edges. Definitely recommend. For the main part of the meal, I had the steak and my partner had the fettuccine. Her plate was practically licked clean, so you know that was good! I had requested my steak medium-rare and definitely had some pieces that were more rare. Unfortunately, did not eat those as they were too rare for my taste. However, the medium-rare pieces were great and melted like butter in my mouth.  We finished the evening with a London Fog and the granola dessert. The granola dessert was good, but I think I was expecting a slightly sweeter dessert.  Overall, a great meal and I'd be happy to eat at Everly again!"}
{"text":"Been to Everly for brunch a few times and definitely a fan of the brunch more than their dinner. Today had the chilaquiles, but the salmon Benedict is good as well. Price on food is pretty reasonable, and the drinks are good as well. If you don't want to wait for a table, go before 10am (a little early on a weekend for some of those that stay up late for their vices!)"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Tuesday night with my fiancé. We started with the Brussel sprouts and charred carrots. Both were very satisfying.   For our main courses I ordered the burger medium rare and my fiancé ordered a forbidden rice curry dish. These were both ok, but not amazing. My burger came out well done but it wasn't dry and it still had a lot of flavor.   If we go back, we will likely order more small plates of vegetables, which all sounded amazing, and likely stay away from the large plates."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today (Sunday) with my mom. We had a reservation for 12:15 and showed up at 12:05, and we were seated right away. Mom ordered scrambled eggs + veggies, I ordered the kale toast w/o the egg. Our server told us it'd be a while as the kitchen was backed up.. fast forward 50+ minutes: no food. Our server had stopped by ONCE to fill our waters--meanwhile she was chatting with another table across the restaurant for 15 minutes. I went to the host stand to let them know we had been waiting almost an hour for toast and eggs--she said \"that sounds about right.\" Then, the manager came to our table, apologized, comped our coffee/tea, and TEN MORE MINUTES later our food comes out. My kale toast was missing half the ingredients listed on the menu (no radishes, garlic, or red pepper/chile flakes), and my moms eggs were totally unseasoned and her toast was cold. I understand having to wait during busy times, but this was outrageous--our server neglected our table, a minimal food order took over an hour, and when the food did arrive it was very poor quality. Please beware when going here! They cannot seem to handle a busy weekend lunch at all.    *Update 11/25/17: after my reviewed visit above, the manager contacted me via Yelp and sincerely apologized, which I really appreciated. I went back to Everly tonight with my friend and had a really great experience. We met at 6:30 and were sat right away. I ordered a London Fog with almond milk which was delicious. My friend and I shared everything: Brussels sprouts, charred broccoli, the squash curry with forbidden rice, and the Nor Cal Sandwich. Everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly, the curry is delicious and the spice level is just right. Service was friendly and attentive and we barely had to wait for anything. This place can really do a great job and their food is wonderful, I love how they focus on veggies! Really glad I went back."}
{"text":"So so so good!  I wish we lived closer to this restaurant, so we could come more. We came here for brunch Saturday morning. To start, this place has a super cool atmosphere inside. They also have a really awesome menu going from classic to very adventurous.   My boyfriend had a bloody and the eggs w/ oysters. I enjoyed the bacon, corn fettuccine and a mimosa. We both truly enjoyed our meals, i would really suggest either of those. I really  had a hard time also not trying the rice pudding.Many additional options they have, that i would like to try!! Please come, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"I was sad to see Bluephie's go, but this place has filled its shoes very well!  Everything from small plates to larger entrees was awesome; I particularly liked the beef tartare and avocado toast.  In fact, the whole toast section of the menu is great.  The wait staff and bartender are very friendly and knowledgeable, I've been here twice now and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WOW! My friend \"Paul\" the Philosopher (the only Licensed Ethicist with a Yelp review to boot: https://www.yelp.com/biz/paul-kelleher-licensed-ethicist-madison?hrid=4zmLihfawAgyZBV9sd9fpA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct) ) kept on raving about the kim chi carrots here. Yeah, OK, Paul, you also said Kant was \"riveting,\" and I, like, died and said: \"I KANT wait until this is over.\"  Paul was right, though. It has just the right mix of seasoning and spice to give you a jolt, but not enough to set your mouth on fire like too much spicy stuff does. The other \"all star\" on the dinner menu is the fried chicken, which in addition to being unbelievable by itself, is topped off with this amazing cheese ranch thing. I kept on doing the thing where I was trying to slurp as much of the stuff off the dish as possible without appearing \"uncivilized.\" Because I just project so much class whenever I enter a place.  Brunch here is OK. I wish they would serve the dishes all day long, though, because I had a craving for these two. \"Brioche\" french toast really didn't come close to that, mainly because french toast inherently doesn't have a high upside the way these more adventurous dishes do. If you insist on going for brunch, I would get this potato chip, egg, and beans thing they have that's really good. I ate both, plus some avocado toast that was really solid."}
{"text":"Loved the look of Everly and had great service but the food never is not good. I had the salmon and avocado Benedict that I only had half of because it didn't taste like anything ( I usually love avocado toast) my boyfriend had the the socal grain bowl that was VERY DRY and when asking for the egg to be over-easy it came to him well done. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I had a blast for Sunday lunch; never been to the 'new' restaurant, but the ambiance, the decor was outstanding.  The three of us were seated promptly and our server was very pleasant.  I did order the Bloody Mary and asked for very spicy (mistake, get medium spicy next time!) but they doctored it with additional tomato juice to bring down the heat!  I ordered the Smoked salmon eggs Benedict (excellent), my wife had the Fried egg nacho ( I liked that also) and our friend had the Omelet with spinach and potatoes.  Overall, great lunch, great service and I thought very reasonable.  A word of caution - this is the Monroe Street neighborhood and it seems that everyone, except us had their kids; so if that is a limiting factor for you, be forewarned.  For me, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but my wife and I ordered 6 small plates and it all came at the same time. Oversight?"}
{"text":"A true gem, while not downtown, this area is Madison's best-kept secret. Have been 3 times, for 3 different meals, and have been pleased each time. Wonderful place that is clean and comfortable with prices that are fair. Also came here once with a party of 12 and they were so accomodating and happy to help us with questions!"}
{"text":"Father's Day at Everly. No kids present but there were two dads. I will start by saying that none of us had a drink. Next time, for sure.  It was a beautiful evening. We sat outside in the lovely patio area and the acoustics were such that we really could not hear any of the other conversations that went on around us. Very nice. Service was excellent. No long waits for food or the bill. We never felt rushed and our meals all came at the same time.  My partner and I shared two dishes. The waitress offered to split our meals for us which was lovely. We ordered the So-Cal Grain bowl which included a soft-boiled egg. They gave us each a whole egg! Nice touch. We also shared the Tuna Conserva Sandwich. We agreed that the grain bowl was spectacular. Nuts, grains, veggies and a wonderful \"dressing\". Next time I will probably order a a bowl of my own. The sandwich was good, especially the bread.. It had a thick slice of cucumber inside which added a nice crunch. The tuna was made from fresh fish but it still was tuna salad...  Our dining companions, who had been to Everly before, were very happy with their meals, as well. She had the grain bowl too and loved it. He had the Brussel Sprout Salad with a myriad of greens, shaved sprouts, nuts, seeds and melon. What a fabulous combination.  After eating healthy at Everly, we walked to Michael's Frozen Custard where both dads received a small sundae for $1. Mmmm. Then we headed to Wingra Park. We sat on a bench, watched some angler's do their thing and just soaked up the magic of the lake. This is a no-wake park so it is silent and ever so beautiful. A feast for the eyes.  I can't wait to go back to Everly. It will be hard to try something new but I promise to try. I will keep you posted."}
{"text":"I wanted to love the Everly, I really did. Went here for Brunch and all I could think was... I wish Bluphies was still around. The space is bright and had a cool vibe. The service was good. (Highly recommend making a reservation on the weekend.) The food was fine. I had the kale toast and enjoyed it. Left still feeling a little hungry. My fiance had the so-cal grain bowl with chicken and left disappointed. There was nothing that tied it together, and for $15, he was expecting more. All-in-all, we won't be heading back any time soon."}
{"text":"Headed out to a Wednesday evening meeting at 1st Church of Christ, Scientist, Madison, I decided to try Everly en route, and enjoyed the Butternut Squash + Forbidden Rice Curry; but be cautioned the Fresno Chiles pack a little punch. After a couple bites, I knew I would need some toast to clean my bowl, and the sourdough not only aided the task, but too was delicious, brushed lightly with olive oil.  The service was so quick, on a busy night, I didn't need to check how many more minutes I had to complete my route by 7:30.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to Everly for brunch and for dinner. For brunch, it's a solid spot, though not the best I've ever had. I was much more impressed with dinner. They serve refreshing cocktails, and the dishes are creative and delicious. Some of the serving sizes leave you wanting more, so if you show up hungry, you may want to ask the waitress about how much food you're going to get with the items you are considering!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and had a great experience! Started with the Brussels sprouts and mushroom toast and both were amazingly delicious. You could tell they used high quality ingredients. Then we each had a sandwich. Only reason for no 5 star - We all found that there was too much aioli on our sandwiches and thought it was strange they came on a white heavily buttered bread (no wheat option). The menu is very health-focused so we just thought this wasn't as consistent. Kale salad was also super salty, some of our group didn't eat it. I would love to come back and try dinner entrees and try every single veggie dish - I think that is where they really shine. Service was also good. Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"I've had dinner here twice and really like this place. I am stingy with my 5 star reviews, 4 stars means I'm a fan and will be back.   The ingredients are fresh and healthy. If you like well-prepared vegetables, good flavors, and/or you are on a restrictive diet, then Everly is for you.  Easy to make several of the dishes gluten-free, and/or vegan by request.  The most recent visit was the best. The vegan butternut squash curry w/ forbidden rice was as beautiful-looking as it was delicious.  I've had the roasted brussels sprouts twice--once the vegetarian way, and once the vegan way and both variations are very good.  Cafe w/ honey, cinnamon and house-made almond milk was awesome.  The So-Cal grain bowl was OK, a little bland--though I think it's an option that would still appeal for the really \"clean eaters\" out there.  The service was great. We were celebrating a b-day and anniversary at our table so the waitress comped our dessert coffees.   Good prices! The portions leave you full, though they aren't massive. Good value."}
{"text":"A modern California inspired restaurant located in a prime Madison location.   I was happy with the labeled menu options that displayed what could be made vegan, although I was unhappy that when asked for it to be made VEGAN the waitress says well it's going to be missing this and that now. I feel that if something is going to be labeled vegan on a menu it should be made vegan for everyone.   My food came out vegan but I could see this causing lots of confusion.   The Brussel sprouts made vegan were too overpowered with lemon for my liking but were cooked very well.   I enjoyed the cauliflower sand which with the side kale salad (super delicious). The main critique I have is that I feel the sand which could have had much more veggies. I loved the sourdough bread but I could hardly taste the ingredients in the sand which due to the proportions.   There are very good alcoholic drink preferences here and I would return. I just wish the menu would have been better written to be more understanding and less confusing.   The outdoor seating and bar is definitely a plus and I applaud the variety of healthy options."}
{"text":"I was nervous at first about eating here but my mind was changed. I was nervous because the food appeared \"healthy\", therefore not flavorful. I was wrong!  Food was flavorful and healthy. I had the special where they did 3 for $25. I had the charred carrots, which was amazing!  I liked my entree which was a yarro risotto. Then the dessert was essan mess which was a meringue with purée berry blend with mint, which was amazing!  Very good and will go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to this neighborhood from out of state and have been searching the area for great restaurants to try. Having walked past Everly recently we decided to give it a shot for brunch and to say that this place is amazing is an understatement. We were able to stop by on foot, but the parking lot out front had plenty of room if you were planning on driving in. We were seated immediately which was nice considering we are used to waiting awhile at great brunch spots. We had viewed the menu online before coming in and our waitress was able to help guide us with a few recommendations which was super helpful. The menu itself has TONS of healthy and unique options which is right up our alley and I'm sure if you came with a group everyone would be able to find something they liked. My husband had ordered the sausage + potato hash and I got one of the soft scrambled eggs options. Our food came out pretty fast and not only was everything super fresh + delicious, but the portion sizes were perfect and my husband and I were both really impressed with our dishes. The rooibus latte was also outstanding. AND THE PRICE! You'd expect for everything to be twice as much considering the final product, but it's safe to say that you could easily come here a few times a week with how reasonable all of the dishes are. Overall, the ambiance/music was spot on, the food surpassed any expectation we had, and the service was great. As much as we'd love to keep this place a secret so we're not waiting an hour for brunch we couldn't help but share this neighborhood spot with the world. Everly will definitely be the first place we bring visitors when they pop in from out of town!"}
{"text":"We tried Everly for a late lunch last weekend. It had only been open for less than a week, but we were excited to try it. Bright, airy, windows which open to an outdoor patio area. It looks like a fun place to hang out for drinks.  We were greeted at the door by the hostess who escorted us to a booth. Our waiter then brought us water and menus. Since we arrived after lunch but before dinner they had a limited menu. We ordered the Avocado Toast and the Whitefish Toast. Think bruschetta -- garlicky toast with various toppings. The Whitefish Toast was amazing. Whitefish in a mayonnaise/mustard based sauce. Mildly pickled cauliflower and radishes on top complimented the whitefish mix. It was delicious! The Avocado Toast however, wasn't quite as good. The avocado and salmon mix was tasty as expected, but it was topped by red onion slices and parsley leaves. The onion and parsley flavors were very sharp and completely overwhelmed the salmon and avocado. Smaller, minced portions might have paired better. The atmosphere, the service, the presentation, and the whitefish were all excellent. I'm glad we tried it and am looking forward to them getting established."}
{"text":"Great for vegetarian, vegan and gluten free diets. I've been here twice, once for restaurant week and once for brunch both were pleasant experiences, and I would go back for lunch or dinner.  I'm a vegetarian so I'm always happy to see more than a salad that I can have. And almost all of their dishes can be modified to be vegetarian or vegan.  I ordered the chiliquiles and they were quite tasty. There were refried beans and green salsa on the bottom, a heaping mountain of very yummy chips on top, and then chihuahua cheese, cilantro and sour cream garnishing the top. The only thing that kind of bummed me out is that I got halfway through my mountain of chips before I even saw the beans at the bottom of the plate. I ordered a beermosa to drink and it was just a tad too bitter for me. I overlooked that it was made with a bitter cube so that was my bad. The grapefruit flavor was very nice though."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Everly the vegetable-centric dishes were well cooked and a refreshing delight. The second visit was a humongous disappointment, this place obviously has a major issue with consistency and I will not be able to visit ever again. The brussels sprouts were raw, the forbidden rice overcooked to an unrecognizable mush, the asian chicken salad laden with clumsy inedible thick slices of napa cabage spines, and the chicken overcooked and dry. The cherry on top was that our table was covered in a swarm of fruit flies and the occasional horse fly. Sanitation issue?"}
{"text":"Super cool, hip new place in the old Bluephie's location.   Open concept and very bright, yet quaint.  Server was very patient and accommodating. We ordered the mozzarella gnocchi balls and the crispy spicy tuna. Both were delicious and were larger than we expected.  The rest of the table's meals were the burger, salmon, chicken Asian salad and the Korean tacos. Rave reviews across the board.  This isn't a place you'd come to for a cheap meal, but the prices reflect the quality of the food.  Can't wait to come back in the summer!"}
{"text":"food is reallygood, menu is very cleat and the kitchen is flexible. the restroom is very clean an upkept. the staff are friendly and are in full awareness of what is going on. the chairs and probably the most comfortable you'll get at a restaurant. the Wi-Fi is fast   the only thing is they don't have electricity outlets."}
{"text":"THE PESTO BUCATINI IS BOMMMMBBBB. No regrets. Cocktails always on point. Nice and open/breezy environment in the summer. Great location. This little neighborhood is just the cutest."}
{"text":"Madison is finally becoming trendy. Not only does the menu make me feel like I'm in chicago or the coast again, but the decor and plates add to the modern atmosphere.   I got the avocado toast which is pretty expensive, about $13 but it had smoked salmon on it. My friend got the salmon hollandaise. We both thought the food was good but underwhelming. The beauty and trendiness of the place made up for the food. We shared the blueberry rice pudding which was our favorite. Maybe trying more dishes will make me like it more next time. I'd give this place 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Never had a disappointing experience here.  Took my kids and they loved it. My son even drank the strawberry jam, he liked it so much.  Breakfast here is top notch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Staff are super friendly and eager-to-please. Very attentive. Went here for the restaurant week lunch menu which was fantastic. The celery root bisque with butternut squash butter was to die for. Perfect balance of flavors. I also liked that almost all of the options could be made gluten free, vegetarian, or vegan. My blueberry Eton mess dessert was super delicious. My husband had the chocolate mousse, which I had to take a bite of, and it was amazing...so decadent and rich. It was also nice that the general manager popped over to ask how our meal was and if we needed anything else. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Flavorful and Yummy!  That said, I would really prefer to give it 3 1/2 stars - with high marks for interesting flavors and low marks for selection and service  I lived in the Bay Area for 13 years, though, and other than the wine selections, I don't see much that's truly California about it.  That said, it's fresh and delicious and reasonably healthy food.  Went on date night recently and shared the brussels sprouts, avocado toast, faro risotto and steak salad.  Each had wake-up-your-tongue flavors and textures, each was its own unique mouth-happy bomb.    I wish they had more interesting dessert selections (though given the range of starters and small plates, maybe it's better that they don't).    The only downside is the service.  The night we were there, the servers really flew around in a panic, not knowing what they were doing.  As a former waitron, I sympathize with the new-restaurant blues, but I expect better from Food Fight."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews buy this is definitely my favorite restaurant in Madison and definitely deserves some praise. It has such a homey, comfy vibe. It's not just that that makes me come back every week, it's the food. It's amazing! They change the menu regularly depending on the season and keep the favorites! My favorite dish is the brussel sprouts (I should probably mention I've always hated brussel sprouts and this is the only place I enjoy them, I actually CRAVE them now!). Other than the food, the staff is awesome! This place deserves 5 stars if not more :)"}
{"text":"Very delicious. I really liked the mix of flavors in the So-Cal Grain Bowl. For me personally, I would have preferred a larger/more filling portion size, but the current sizes are good if you're aiming to eat less."}
{"text":"Overall statement - I still miss Bluphies!  We went with a group and had dinner. I needed a shoehorn to get into the table, the chairs are way too big for the table and I'm not a big guy. The service was great, but I wasn't a fan of the menu. I ended up with the burger trying to stay easy.  The burger was tiny in a oversized bun and the herb-roasted potatoes tasted like they were cooked with torch gun. It should really be listed as $$$, it was very pricey.   No reason for me to go back. I'm actually surprised other people rated it that high, just not my type of food."}
{"text":"The soft-scrambled eggs with whitefish were particularly delicious and well prepared. This space is very open and bright. Oh, and the most COMFORTABLE chairs I've ever sat in at a restaurant around here. Kudos for that! Everyone loved their food here, and we left very full but feeling very good about what we ate."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I had not heard of this place prior to today. Although the menu may be short, everything in it is worth giving a try. We came with a large group so we were able to sample most of it and we were all more than satisfied (I would suggest swapping your side of fries for truffle fries). The servers were very friendly and accommodating. Also, the chairs are extremely comfortable, which may not seem important but they improved my experience. Overall, I would recommend Everly if you're looking for food that is worth its reasonable price."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY definitely would recommend the chilaquiles (and def add the pork) and the smoked salmon eggs benedict"}
{"text":"I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon on gluten free bread and my boyfriend had the whitefish scramble. Both were quite good. Service was very good and our waitress was quite friendly. They have outdoor seating so I want to make sure to come back when it is warm out."}
{"text":"My husband and I cannot say enough good things about this place. It was our first visit, and we know there will be many more. Everything was wonderful. The atmosphere was light and happy, the appetizers were something special, the drinks were very yummy and the desserts were unique. You must try the mushrooms on toast and the fried cauliflower. The tastes, smells, and textures that are offered are phenomenal. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our waiter offered great advice for us being first timers there. You must give it a try!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and service were phenomenal. Having just spent a month in LA, this place nails the California vibe. Most importantly, everything we ate and drank was delicious - and at great prices!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends. Desserts and drinks only. Servers were friendly. Food was....  While we were not impressed with our desserts, the manager told us that they are revamping the dessert menu. I think we'd like to give the place another chance because it was a neat ambience.  My Earl gray latte was delicious...So make sure to have that. My friends white Russian was not what we typically would have expected.  The general manager and staff were very friendly and accomodating tomorrow feedback. They said they would like us to come back soon and give them another try. I think we will!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. The food was good but not great, especially compared to the many amazing restaurants in Madison. The avocado toast was great along with are other entrees but the ice cream we got for dessert was freezer burned. We went when it first opened so I will definitely give it another chance, since it's been open for longer now."}
{"text":"I offered Everly as an option when my roommate's mother was in town for a place for us to have dinner together. It was great!   We arrived and were told that it would be a 30-45 minute wait, but that we were welcome to grab a drink at the bar and eat there if a space opened up. The bar was crowded, but we found space to stand at the far end of the bar. All of the servers who had to maneuver around the area we were standing in were so polite!   We got to the bar and decided to order a bottle of wine. We asked if we could have a sample of our top two choices before ordering a bottle and they gladly accommodated us. I have no idea how long we waited (probably close to the predicted time frame) before we were seated. The time flied as we loved perusing the menu and chatting with one another.   Once we were seated we were met with great service. We ordered the steamed mussels and bread to start, very good! I ordered buckwheat Bolognese and I LOVED it! Highly recommend. I also tried the farro risotto and that was quite good. At the end of our meal the general manager stopped by to ensure everything had gone smoothly. A really nice touch.  The only downside is we didn't save room for dessert! I'll be back to check out more things on the menu for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the roasted Brussels sprouts, beets with grapefruit and orange creme fraiche and butternut squash and forbidden rice coconut curry with a Chenin Blanc - amazing.  Finished off with the caramelizad granola with a white wine berry reduction, fresh blueberries and an orange, yogurt whipped cream and, of course, Colectivo coffee.  Everything came out fresh and perfectly cooked.  Our service was attentive and cordial without being intrusive.  The room was fresh and modern but had enough warm wood to be cozy.  This is a great dining experience.  Outstanding vegetarian and pescatarian options.  I only eat kosher meat and usually don't have so many options!"}
{"text":"Ordered a whitefish toast and fried chicken and both were just okay. Chicken was a little soggy and toast was more like...they slapped some cold fish on a cold piece of bread.   What really took the cake for this place was the discovery of a rather large piece of plastic wrap on my toast. It wasn't until after I took a bite and had to keep chewing and chewing to realize that what I had been munching on was a nice piece of plastic wrap. Not the best experience, but I appreciate the staff for being quite apologetic and giving us some bogo coupons."}
{"text":"All I want to say is: \"Lot of grains hot cakes\"  Order it. Eat it. You can thank me later.   This is literally a hot 'cake' - baked, fluffy, grainy, crispy in the edges, lightly sweetened, and topped with crunchy oatmeal. Oh man! My 3 year old foodie devoured this. And by that I mean she ate a third of it. She's only 3. The hubby, mom and I ate the rest because you don't just leave that wasting on the table.   Service was good. The food takes some time to make so order some coffee or drinks and be prepared to wait for a bit.   The coffee was a 2 on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best). I would stick to their cocktails or water.   I ordered soft scrambled eggs - they were made beautifully. Perfectly whipped and scrambled it was like eating soft butter. The hubby for the chilaquiles and it came with a delicious green salsa. My meal had a side of toast and this berry purée that was so delicious my daughter ate it with a spoon."}
{"text":"We were surprised by how not-busy it was for a Saturday night. I wonder if they're more of a breakfast joint. We sat on the heated patio, it was nice! Highly recommend the brussel sprouts. Dinner was nice. All around good place. Portions were perfect sized for us."}
{"text":"Only been there once and would not go back. Prices are high, decor is interesting but with the garage door walls, Edison bulbs and mold like wall center piece it really feels like they are trying way too hard to check all the hipster boxes. Every dish has at least 5 unnecessary ingredients that add nothing to the flavor. Service was slow and we were seated the closest they could get us to the kitchen in an empty restaurant. My friend's Salmon sandwich was mostly bread. Madison has many great restaurants. My advice, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch. First, I love anywhere with a nice patio, plus this has a great indoor/outdoor bar that adds charm. The shaved vegetable salad was a delightful discovery. Beautiful fresh ingredients tossed with a light vinaigrette and supremely tasty blue cheese. I had leftovers to bring home to share, which is always a bonus. My daughter loved \"lots of grains\" hotcake. The second time, I had the avocado toast with salmon and red onion, which I would also recommend. The menu includes some interesting specialty cocktails. Everly definitely made it to my list of favorite stops."}
{"text":"We have gone here once before, a couple years ago, and really enjoyed the food and vibe. They have several vegetarian options which is surprisingly hard to find in Madison, so that's automatic points. But tonight we went back at 8pm, got seated, and proceeded to be ignored for 15 minutes by everyone. No water, no \"I'll be with you in just a minute\", nothing at all. We walked out and the hostess was very apologetic, but seriously...went up to Brasserie V and got served within 2 minutes. Two stars instead of one because the hostess clearly felt bad."}
{"text":"Came into Everly today for lunch. First off, the atmosphere is adorable, felt like I was in California instead of 37 degree Madison. Our server was very friendly and offered us excellent recommendations.  For a vegetable dish we got the Brussels sprouts. They were pan roasted with a delicious savory sauce. Definitely tasty, 10/10 would order again.  We then got the mushroom toast which come with marrow butter. Talk about rich!! We almost licked the plate it was so good.  Lastly we got the lunch special which was a salmon sandwich. While it did not quite have the punch of the Brussels sprouts or mushroom toast the salmon was very well cooked with excellent bread and interesting toppings.  For the quality and flavor of the ingredients I felt the price was fair. I will be back from weekend brunch next!"}
{"text":"I went here for a burger and a side salad of Kale. Great flavor and presentation. The server was really friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that like many cavernous modern spaces with glass and high ceilings the noise of the filled up restaurant almost drowned out my lunch companion. Literally I almost resorted to passing notes at the table. Otherwise it is a solid lunch choice. Parking was readily available and free unlike going to the belly of the downtown Isthmus beast."}
{"text":"Service was great. Atmosphere is cool and the restaurant is a trendy little place. My fresh squeezed orange juice was exactly what I needed on a hot day. I've also been craving pancakes lately, and Everly's hotcakes hit the spot. I really wanted chocolate chips, which they didn't have, so they gave me some chocolate sauce to pour on my hot cake and it was so YUM!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people, all of whom have different food preferences and restrictions. Everly easily accommodated our group and everyone (including a vegan, a person with gluten-sensitives, and one who avoids dairy) was able to directly order off of the standard menu and was 100% thrilled with brunch.   I should mention also, that our group included someone who is the complete opposite of the other members and craves tons of meat and cheese, and he was also completely happy with the menu options and his meal. Basically, Everly was a perfect fit for the challenging task of feeding and satisfying a group with diverse food preferences.   Growing up, my family and I frequented Bluephie's quite a bit. While I have fond memories of that restaurant, I really love what the new restaurant owners have done with the space and renovations. I am not at all nostalgic, I think this is a great new venue.  Everly being described as a California-style restaurant had me pretty skeptical, because that sounds like hipster nonsense, but the actual experience and environment put all doubts to rest. After brunch, we all agreed that we want to come back and try other menu items.  This is a great place to take your family, especially if you want to impress in-laws or feed variety appetites."}
{"text":"Very cool space. Bright, crisp and open-goes very well with the theme of California. I've been there a few times now and have always been greeted at the door by very friendly hosts.   My first visit was for brunch. The hangtown fry was a delicious mesh of food stuffs. All the flavors complimented each other very well. I had the chilaquiles. Now these aren't the traditional ones but made for an okay breakfast. The chips were over-fried and at first glance I thought they had forgotten the black beans. Low and behold there was a HUGE mountain of black bean paste underneath the pile of other goodies. It was so large it was unappetizing. The dish would be far better suited if the black beans were not as thick and were layered with the other ingredients.  More recently we went for the Valentine's Day tasting menu. It was fine, nothing spectacular though. The mushroom toast was excellent and the cauliflower gratin was divine. The desserts were a bit disappointing as were the mains. Not quite sure why but it just didn't knock my socks off. Everything tastes very fresh though!  Service has only been fine-not bad but certainly not outstanding. I'd rank this place at the top of the Food Fight places. Cocktails are creative. No beers on tap but a nice showing for some decent California brews in bottles/cans. Food has been 3-4 starts but the space bumps it up to 4."}
{"text":"I liked my visit overall but I think there's a few things that aren't optimal yet.  I was surprised by the price point - it was lower than I expected, which is always a great surprise!   We ordered-  spicy tuna crispy rice. An all time favorite normally, but the Everly version had its own twists. The tuna was chunkier - liked. But they had more rice than usual, and the non-crispy part was particularly sticky - less liked Beets and burrata salad - loved this dish. The only comment here would be that every bite wasn't consistent which would have brought this really above and beyond.  Ordered the veggie pesto bucatini and the brick chicken.  The egg on the bucatini was a highlight - and the nuttiness of the dish was great. The brick chicken was ok. Crisp skin which was nice-  but the lentils were the real star.  I always think I'd like to make lentils whenever I have them with a dish, and this time was no different.  I love that they deliver now - I imagine I'll try to take inventory of which things would deliver better than others... bucatini and beet salad"}
{"text":"Omg....sooooo good. Reminds me of places I've  eaten @ in California.  Hubby and I shared the avocado toast, and we ordered the steak and arugula salad and roasted chicken sandwich with kale as my side.  EVERYTHING was delicious and fresh.  Their tea lattes are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Man, this place really knocked it out of the park. It's clean and spacious on the inside, so it's got a really good, welcoming vibe. Definitely a good place to wander into on a cold night.  Service is consistently attentive; several things were off the menu that night so they had to make some special arrangements with us, but it never negatively affected the meal. Rather, it felt like they were working to find solutions, which is what a really good restaurant does. Conversely, it never felt like they were hovering over us.  But, as with all restaurants, the selling point of a restaurant is the food, and the food delivers here. I went with the creamed corn and grilled shrimp, and I have to say it was the best creamed corn I've ever eaten: spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. My girlfriend's ravioli was equally delicious and would have been so even without the bacon in it.   The entrees are a little on the smaller side, so I would suggest getting an appetizer. The mussels worked really well for us."}
{"text":"Really great menu and bar. Especially fun to go to in the summer. Love the bar that is indoor/outdoor. Favorite dish= fried chicken. Brunch is decent good. great date spot and has a diverse menu offering."}
{"text":"Had to check out the Madison interpretation of California food, having just moved here from LA this past year! Well, we loved it. The place looks and feels great, the staff is super friendly, and the food is delicious. Nice selection of reasonable priced California wines, although I went with the liquid Creamsicle (perhaps not the right name but you will recognize it on the menu--order it!). Lots of choices for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I will have to return for their brunch SOON!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try Everly and saw our opportunity this past Thursday night.  Immediate impressions- love the parking, lots of natural light but what's up with the chairs?  I felt a little like I was in an airport lounge.  Anyway, we didn't have a lot of time trying to get to our daughters concert so we ordered pretty quickly.  Our daughter had the burger and potatoes....she said it was pretty good but keep in mind she's 5.    My husband ordered the mussels as a starter and the salad w salmon as his entree.  I got the buckwheat bolognese.  The mussel broth and bread were both excellent but the mussels themselves were not high quality.  My husbands salad was very overdressed and my pasta was very al dente and extremely salty.  I was very disappointed with the food.  I may try again with some different menu options but was not at all impressed.  Bummer."}
{"text":"I have been here for both brunch and dinner.  Both of my meals had good food and the service was good.  My biggest complaint was that the portions were on the small side, but the location and atmosphere are nice and the cocktails are very good."}
{"text":"~ !! ~ Everly is on FIRE! Consistency is key, and Everly exceeds my expectations each time I visit. My favorite thing about Everly? The Beergarden!   I made it there for happy hour, which means not only did I get to enjoy discounted drinks, but I had the added pleasure of having those drinks accompanied by the summer breeze via Everly's beautiful outdoor bar. The gorgeous marble counter top is perfect for fancy pic-snapping. Also, you get to view their internal decor from a different vantage point- adds a whole new dimension to the elegance! If you'd rather not sit at the bar, the outdoor area has plenty seats for ya!   Meanwhile, anyone I've ever talked to about Everly has had amazing things to say- me included. The food: so good. The drinks: made with love. The staff: so kind and accommodating. If you're on the fence about checking this place out, I ~strongly~ suggest you hop off it and give them a chance!"}
{"text":"After our last visit and my previous review, we were sent a voucher to come back and give them a second (third) try. I can't lie, we put it off for over a year. But, we ended up back on Friday. It was such a dramatic improvement, I couldn't believe it. We split 3 appetizers since we were there at happy hour (roasted carrots and kimchi, charred broccoli and fried mozz gnocchi) then my husband had the fried chicken sandwich, I had the veggie burger and we ended the meal with the blackberry sunday. The veggie apps were perfect and both sandwiches were fantastic, as was the Sunday. The cocktail I had (the one with chili vodka, citrus and honey) was perfectly balanced. Service was on point too. Would highly recommend and will be back. Glad to see they worked out the kinks"}
{"text":"I visited Everly for the first time today and my brunch was excellent! Great design and atmosphere and delicious coffee. I ordered the chilaquiles and every part of the meal tasted fresh. The service was attentive and the manager stopped  by to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Service: 3.5/5 - claimed all tables were taken with reservations at 9 at night. B.S. the entire place was wide open. Bartender also took too long with asking for our food order. Nice guy but not timely.  Counter cleanliness: 5/5 - excellent marble counters. You could spill your drink and lick it off the table.  Napkins: 5/5 - nice cloth. Protected your lap from spills.  Food: 4/5 - Brussel sprouts were way undercooked. But steak tacos were fuego.  Atmosphere: 5/5- bomb spot. Felt like you were at at $100 spot when in reality prices were ~$15/plate. Loved the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"My first experience here and I loved here it! I sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice and very helpful. He never acted annoyed and had valuable knowledge of the menu I really appreciated that. He had great recommendations! I am definitely giving 5 stars for the combination of food service and atmosphere. The restaurant was clean modern and nothing like I've experienced in Madison. Honestly it was hard for me to decide what to get and will be back to try other things. I ended up getting the fried artichokes and the salmon entree. Both very good I felt very healthy with my salmon choice and it had a lot of flavor and was cooked perfect. Great menu great staff and great drinks!"}
{"text":"So disappointing.  Service wasn't awful, but but really present. Food was very, very, very underwhelming. Baked oysters, still attached to the shell, so impossible to eat. It bothers me when I'm paying money for \"wild\" or \"other\"  sounding mushrooms and get straight up button mushrooms on a dish.  This is not Bolognese... the artichokes were alright, but coupled with the odd space (plastic, white... reminds me of 90's kitchens) won't bring me back."}
{"text":"We LOVED the vegetable appetizers we ordered, the charred broccoli and pan roasted brussels sprouts (I did hear another customer complaining and sending back the broccoli because it was \"too\" cooked-- even though it said charred on the menu?!) The butternut squash curry was delicious as well. However, I was a bit disappointed by my NorCal sandwich, and in general, that (a) there are not many vegan options besides appetizers, although the place advertises that they are a 'vegetable' place, and (b) the menu lacks substantial vegan protein options. A simple \"add tofu\" (or any substantial vegan food of choice) option for the salads and grain bowls would make me much more likely to go back."}
{"text":"I have visited Everly five times--once for dinner and four times for breakfast.   We enjoyed our dinner for the most part. The mushroom toast on MSD's delicious miche bread was the night's winner. We enjoyed the cauliflower and fried artichokes just fine. Much less successful were the remoulade salad, in which the ingredients just didn't seem to add up to a unified dish, and the butternut squash and rice curry, which came with just five (literally, I counted)   1/2-inch cubes of squash, about 3 tablespoons of sauce, and an INSANE amount of flavorless rice.   We have found the food at brunch to be more successful, if inconsistent. And although the service is a major disappointment every time we visit (long waits for service & food delivery, servers lacking knowledge about the menu), the food and great location kept bringing us back.   Our favorite brunch items are the brown rice pudding and the caramelized granola, both of which are beautifully balanced in texture and flavor. When we ordered both of these dishes during a recent visit, however, we were disappointed. First, it took around 30 minutes for our food to come out, which was surprising, because the restaurant was only one-quarter full when we ordered. When the food finally arrived, we discovered that the chef had forgotten to include the very ingredients that take these dishes to the next level--the chopped mint and orange-scented yogurt that belong on the granola and the hazelnuts and grapefruit creme fraiche for the brown rice pudding. Instead, each dish received a small dollop of plain whipped cream, which did nothing to add flavor or complexity.   When the manager came to check on us, we (politely and patiently) explained that the dishes were fine, but were missing these key ingredients. It took another 10 minutes to get the ramekins containing the proper ingredients (and even then, \"orange-scented yogurt\" we received was just plain whipped cream with some orange zest sprinkled on top). The manager did not check on us after that or offer us any discount for our disappointing meals.   On a previous visit, we ordered the Lots of Grains hotcake and discovered that the center of the thick pancake was completely raw batter, so we sent it back. Even after another round on the grill, it came back very gooey inside. When we sent it back a third time, it returned cooked through, at last, but burned black on the outside. The manager was very apologetic, and insisted on taking the hotcake off of our bill.   This place has so much potential, and I REALLY want it to succeed. But I expect more from a Food Fight restaurant. Until management makes significant efforts to improve quality control, service issues, and loyalty efforts, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Dined here for the Valentine's Day. I like the simplistic view of the place and the hanging lights were pretty.   Course 1: Beef Tartare (very good) and the Baked Oysters (good but not a fan of the ham).  Course 2: Roasted Squash (meh nothing special) and Mushroom Seasonal Toast (very good!)  Course 3: Flat Iron Steak and Short Ribs. Although the flavor wasn't anything spectacular, the meats were both cooked well. We especially liked the Short Ribs, very tender!  Course 4: Eton Mess and Apple Brown Butter. Eton Mess was probably the most unique course of the meal, I liked it!  For a drink, I got the Bartender's Secret Handshake Cocktail. I love ginger beer but something about this tasted a little off.   For the price, this was somewhat reasonable. I also appreciate the effort of fine dining for changing our place settings after every course, but I think more needs to be done about the decor and ambience to really feel that way. Would like to come back and try brunch."}
{"text":"Could not be more different from Bluephies, and I mean that in a good way! They designed the place very well, the bar area is beautiful.   As for the food, everything was really well done. We started with the brussel sprouts and roasted squash. The sprouts were above average, but the squash was one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. I never thought I would daydream about vegetables, but that squash is definitely worth it.   After that we had the mushroom toast and baked oysters. Oysters with bacon, heaven in a shell. We finished off with the pulled pork over grits and the salmon. The pork and grits were above average but not exceptional, but the salmon was near perfection. It was one of the best salmon fillets I have had in Madison.   Great drinks, great service, great menu. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everly is a great addition to Monroe Street. It still has a neighborhood feel, but with a modern and slightly fancier twist. You can dress up or keep it casual and still feel like you are fitting in.   The good was really fantastic; I'd recommend pretty much everything we got. In particular, the Brussel sprouts, avocado toast, and pork meatballs were terrific! The cocktails were reasonably priced and also really great; we especially liked the Hola from the Other Side.   Lastly, the service was very high quality. Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and very willing to adjust items with gluten free options, etc.   I'll definitely be back, probably to try brunch next time :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Everly three times now and I want to love it so badly, but each time I have left feeling a little underwhelmed. I gave it 4 stars for the reviews, but was on the fence of giving it 3.  Our most recent trip was for Easter brunch. My parents and grandma were in town from Chicago, and my sister and her husband joined us for brunch out. My parents were huge fans of Bluphies when It used to occupy the space Everly is now in, so we decided to take them to check out the new restaurant. We ordered drinks and my grandma was very impressed with her Bloody Mary. Everyone had a great time and was very satisfied with their food however, my chicken sandwich was a little bland, and honestly something I wouldn't order again.   I'm primarily vegetarian and in past visits I've gotten multiple sides of vegetables. Although their vegetables are tasty, you're basically paying a fairly high price for something I could likely make at home. I appreciate the California fresh vibe, and I've been really wanting to check out their patio... however, Everly is just one of those restaurants that doesn't rank high on my go-to list of places... and definitely not something that I crave. Nonetheless, it's a beautiful restaurant with delicious food and something definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Everly with a coworker the other day. I hadn't been there since it was Bluephies so I was looking forward to seeing all the changes they've made with décor and menus. Upon walking in, I really liked the open, airy environment that they created. It's clean and white with nice greens and warm wood accents spread throughout. I even liked the light fixtures and the ability to see into the kitchen (somewhat). But my favorite part of the new décor..........the chairs! They are truly the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in at any restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life. Big statement, I know, but absolutely true.  It's a California-inspired menu and I'm a California-made girl (Bakersfield to be exact) so I was looking forward to fresh flavors and lots of beautiful vegetables & lean proteins. Their menu is lovely and full of fun, delicious, healthy things to eat. The prices are a bit higher, but for me, it's worth it for the quality of food you're getting. Our server, Carrin, was super fun, really helpful since we were first timers and just the perfect amount of sassy. We really enjoyed her.  I ordered the avocado toast which comes topped with this incredibly luscious salmon. Carrin recommended I order a vegetable side as well since it's a smaller plate. So I chose a side of brussel sprouts. I also ordered the avocado toast sans red onions and then later I pulled the peppers off. While I'm an adventurous eater, I have a tender constitution when it comes to raw onions and hotter peppers. That's just me. The food was fantastic and unique! They use Madison Sourdough bread (yum), the avocados were perfectly ripe (just needed a pinch of salt), the parsley and lemon juice on top added this wonderful brightness to it, and the salmon............the salmon was like the frosting. It was kind of magnificent, y'all. I will definitely order the toast again. And last, but certainly not least, the brussel sprouts.....they were, to date, the sexiest and yummiest I've ever had. Anywhere. And who doesn't love a sexy sprout?! #amiright  They were caramelized and tender and tossed in this creamy, but not at all heavy, garlic aioli. So good it makes you want to slap yo mama!!!! *not really, it's just a saying.   It was a great first experience and I am excited about going there for dinner some night to try the larger plates, but I'll definitely be back for lunch, to sit in those crazy comfy chairs and eat some perfectly avocado toast, maybe with a side of sexy sprouts, who knows....."}
{"text":"I just moved to Madison from California and all my friends are telling me I'm going to get fat here. I'm deathly afraid of gaining weight. Deathly afraid. On my first weekend here I decided to check out Madison's vegetarian and healthy options and I came across Everly. Right when I walked in I was surprised at how big and airy the space feels, very reflective of the food and menu. I ended up ordering the SoCal grain bowl which is the perfect summer lunch. It feels light while still being filling. There's tons of texture and crunch to the dish. It was so good I ended up taking a picture of the menu to try and recreate it at home. Definitely coming back to try some of there other brunch options."}
{"text":"Babe and I went for brunch on a Sunday about 10 am. I really like the space and the booth was very comfortable. The menu was new and quite different from pretty much all other brunch places in Madison. Babe had soft scrambled eggs with toast and in house made jam, and I had the crispy rice bowl. While I enjoyed the crispy rice bowl, I was expecting crispy rice with regular cooked rice but it was crispy throughout which I found a bit too much (my jaw was sore from all that crunching) and I wanted the vinaigrette to have a bit more punch and a bit more of it. The dish was very nice but I think I ordered the wrong thing for me. I really want to go back and have what Babe had because I tried her food and it was very good.  The restaurant has a nice outside space but due to summer allergies we hangout on the inside. I am most impressed with the menu selection and if you are tired of the same old standard American breakfast, it's time to ditch Denny's and head over to the Everly."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are friends with another couple who are possibly alternate timeline versions of us, or perhaps they are distant relatives of our distant relatives of our distant relatives (perhaps making them close relatives again). Let's call them \"Barry\" and \"Capy.\" They often say and do things from which I can grok no earthly understanding. They're capybaras, not that it matters. I hope it's not condescending when I describe them as 'adorable in their wild innocence.' I'm quite fond of them, don't get me wrong.   They've been quite upset with the turmoil across the nation (understandably so, them being capybaras), so they needed a breather. They suggested we do something for Madison Restaurant week and we happily obliged.   I suggested we try Everly, because I like the font of their logo. What a nice font! In preparation for our meal, \"Barry\" brought over a board game and we all played (\"Capy\" and him are quite competitive) while I bombarded them Everly Brothers music. I enjoy the tunes and I couldn't get the word 'Everly' out of my head for some reason. Sometimes a word gets stuck in my head and I cannot shake it loose. Like 'capybara' for example.  I'm not sure if this is indicative of their normal menu but a lot of options could be prepared gluten free which was nice for my girlfriend. Our friends didn't care, they're cuisine agnostic. Anyway, here's how dinner went down.  Cocktails: I ordered the Golden State, a take on a gin and tonic with a rosemary sprig. Refreshing as hell, probably one of the best G&T's I've ever had. My girlfriend ordered a Bartender's Secret Handshake, it was very Fernet forward which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel it was unbalanced. Our companions opted to bring their own water bowl from home and drank hungrily from it while we waited for food, splashing the floor on occasion. Our waitress was kind and accommodating; she mentioned that her cousin is a capybara.  Starter: Roasted Cauliflower. I wish I could have had 2 pounds of this. It was grilled and tossed in vinegar of some sort. Whatever it was, it was meaty and fragrant and delicious. Our hairy friends seem to enjoy theirs as well, though they both excused themselves abruptly. I thought something had unsettled their stomachs, but I think they just went to the bathroom together to have a capybara make out session.  Main: Grits and Pork Shoulder. I keep trying grits, and maybe one day I will like them. One time I ordered jerk chicken at the Great Dane and in that moment I realized that I hated jerk chicken. So, I asked our waitress for a bun and some BBQ sauce and I turned it into an awesome BBQ chicken sandwich. Maybe I should have pulled that crap again here. \"Barry\" had a bolognese that I had a bite of and enjoyed. Intense flavor of carrots. My girlfriend and \"Capy\" both got something with farro, I forget what it was, and didn't ask for a second taste.  Dessert: Chocolate Mousse. Extremely sweet, I devoured it while my teeth screamed.  Overall, very focused and delicious food at affordable prices. I will definitely come again and try the standard menu. To cap off the night, we took a stroll by the lake and our friends growled at some squirrels."}
{"text":"This place rocked. They even gave us free artichoke toast after waiting 30 minutes. Our waiter was awesome. Highly recommend the Brussels sprouts, mussels, and fried artichoke. A must go to!!!! Madison's best in the south west"}
{"text":"This place is a bit unique for Madison and reflects a more contemporary move towards smaller plates, more seafood, and more interesting flavor combinations. I think there are going to be a good amount of people who are disappointed with the portion sizes - you really need to get a couple items if you are hungry and now you're looking at a 20-25 dollar meal instead of a 10-15 dollar affair. I recommend  curry eggplant, avocado toast, and baked oysters. This is a good place to have a few drinks and a snack after work with someone cute"}
{"text":"Brunch, brunch, brunch! Yummy yummy yum yum!  Now that that's out of my system...  This place has delicious brunch food. Also, they have a lot of vegetarian friendly options, so you actually have choices! What luxury! Meatless things are just as delicious and don't ruin the environment. Everybody wins!  What I tried: Chilaquiles- I give this a 10/10. I wish I was eating this right now Brown Rice Pudding- very interesting. Nice and nutty. I thought it could have been a little sweeter, but I'm kind of a trash monster, so take that with a grain of salt Brioche French Toast- my only criticism is that it could have used more sauce (blueberry jam, which I totally could have asked for more of), otherwise was delightful.  Everly replaced Bluephies (may it rest in peace). They had the most amazing bananas foster french toast. If there is one thing Everly is missing, it's that french toast. Please Everly Gods, bring it back!!!  Can't wait to come back for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about dining with another Yelp bud is that when you can't decide what to order, you just decide to order it all. We ended up dining on the first night of their new menu, and it was absolutely wonderful. The restaurant itself is really modern and beautiful, service was ultra friendly and genuine, and we had no wait for our early bird dinner.   Since we ordered quite a bit I'll just break it down in the same style of the menu:   FIRST THINGS FIRST + Fried Mozz Gnocchi: a cross between a gnocchi and a cheese curd. So decadent and so delicious. Definitely great for sharing as it was very rich.  + Pan-Roasted Shishito Peppers: spicy, more cheese than you'd expect, and a very tasty spicy aioli to compliment it.  + Potato Curry Samosas: two samosas, very tasty and filling, but ours came with raw onions instead of the listed fried onions. Definitely would have preferred the latter.  + Roasted Brussels Sprouts: I didn't know how I was going to feel about gribiche (egg sauce) but it really, really worked with the perfectly roasted sprouts.   MAINS + Beef Brisket Pot Roast: the ultimate comfort food. The roast was perfectly tender and shredded well and a good portion. The glazed carrots were caramelized and next-level good. I'd order these as a side if they'd let me. The mashed potatoes were a little runny from the red wine jus; it was the only miss in the entire night and could be remedied for me by being served on the side instead of in the sauce.   My dining partner got a carrot salad as her entree that looked really great and was probably wayyyy healthier than my pot roast after our app fest, but I have no regrets. With all our dishes I had two rounds of leftovers which was pretty great - things reheated surprisingly well.   Looking forward to my next visit and exploring more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Horrible service - food tries to hard - a Los Angeles wanna be but misses.  We're here during a very slow time and they were more interested in setting the tables instead is serving us.    I would not go back - lots of other choices around"}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Terrible service. Food came sporadically.  Salads disappointed immensely.  Guest of honor was always served last.  Dessert was pathetic.  Appeared to be store bought canned peaches and inferior ice cream, not sorbet as indicated."}
{"text":"Executive summary: lots of options for vegetarians/vegans/gluten sensitive folks, food was ok to good, restaurant is new, bright and open, restrooms are bright and tidy, parking gets dicey.  Read on for my full review.   How could I not love a restaurant who has a menu section called \"Things on Toast\"?  Even more so when those \"things on toast\" can be made gluten sensitive, and one offering is even vegetarian and vegan too!  Seriously, if you are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten sensitive you gotta check this place out.  Tons of options on the menu for any and all of the above.  And let me tell you it can be hard to find vegetarian options that are also gluten sensitive.  I was there with a group of 8 so we had lots of different foods.  The mushroom toast got a thumbs up.  The whitefish toast met with mixed reviews, some really liked it, some only so-so.  The quinoa bowl could use more quinoa or a vegetarian protein option but was tasty.  The squash curry was either too dry or there was too much forbidden rice.  The ratio of sauce to rice was definitely off but I didn't say anything to the server that's on me.  The hamburger was \"good\" and the steak salad was yummy except for the salty olives.  All in all, the food was good and with so many veggie/gs options I'll be back to try more!  The restrooms are brand-spanking new, white tile, clean, bright and tidy.  Just the way I like it!  The restaurant is also bright and tidy.  High ceilings, open floor plan.  I imagine it could get noisy here on a busy brunch day as there aren't many sound absorbing materials in the space but we had the place almost to ourselves when we were there.  They have a small parking lot outside the restaurant.  This is where Bluephies used to be if you're familiar with that restaurant.  There is street parking as well but I imagine on a busy day it might be hard to find a spot.  We were there Sunday evening around 6pm so no issues."}
{"text":"Everly is Madison's newest--and arguably spot of the summer--restaurant. Tucked away on Monroe Street in the building where Bluephies once resided, Everly provides American cuisine with a West Coast flare.   With cuisine coming from Chef Scott Harrwell of Chicago-based, Michelin star winning restaurant Tru, this latest installment by Food Fight Inc. was sure to be a hit from the beginning.   Before even looking at the menu, the ambiance makes it clear that Everly is a trendy hub. With sky-high ceilings, exposed light bulbs dangling from the ceiling, natural light and succulents strategically placed on the wall, my friend and I could not stop taking photos.    All food and drink are sourced mindfully, with craft beverages coming from small Californian producers and ingredients locally/regionally. Note, I am someone who orders a cocktail solely based off of the name, so my drink of choice was \"Bubbles and Stuff\"--essentially vodka, mint, strawberry and wine. Though I went to the top party school in the nation, I am not a monumental drinker. That said, Bubbles and Stuff was phenomenal and I definitely could have had three more.   In regard to the meal, Everly's menu is described as \"healthy comfort food\" that caters to both bacon lovers and the vegan of your friend group. My friend and I decided to treat our order tapas-style partially because we are terrible at making up our minds and partially because everything on the menu sounded amazing.   To split, we ordered the pan roasted Brussels sprouts (gribiche, parsley, chives, shallots, garlic, lemon) seasonal mushroom toast (sautéed mushrooms, marrow gutter, garlic, herbs, mushroom jus) and the salmon sandwich (shaved Brussels sprouts, cranberries, apples, Nueske's bacon aioli). The Brussels sprouts did not blow me away by any means, though they were still tasty. Our server said that the mushroom toast was so popular that it was going to be taken off the menu in order for the chef to recuperate, so we knew we had to order it. All that said, I still have dreams about the beauty that was the salmon sandwich.the dish I have dreams about the most is still the salmon sandwich.   When my friend elected to get a second drink after lunch, I dove straight for the dessert menu. By no means would I describe the dessert menu as vast--in fact, there are only three options--I would say that it covers all necessary bases. I made the easy decision of selecting the dark chocolate sorbet with sea salt.  From someone who had been anticipating Everly for literal months, they definitely did not disappoint. I will be back for weekend brunch, dark chocolate sorbet and do not think for  a second that I have forgotten about the salmon sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is my new obsession!  They make healthful food actually taste good. I'm testing out a dairy/gluten free diet, and this is one of the few places I've found that can really accommodate. The charred carrots are to die for, the butternut squash/coconut forgotten curry dish was one of the best vegetarian meals I've ever had, and the So-Cal Grain bowl is awesome for a clean-eating lunch. I want to hug Food Fight Group for this place! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights  1) great food! 2) friendly service 3) lots of gluten free options  Everly blew our expectations out of the water! I knew Everly was \"California Fresh\" which I took to mean lots of grilled fish and salads. Boy was I wrong! The menu is loaded with great salads, hot appetizers, pasta, and other entrees.   We visited during the Summer 2017 restaurant week and the event menu was really impressive, with California wine pairings. We decided not to do the restaurant week menu because there were a few things on the main menu that we just had to try. Almost everything on the menu can be modified to be gluten free, and not just the usuals like salads and meat! I'm talking g free bread people!  We did the brussel sprouts appetizer, the strawberry and asparagus salad, the steak and this amazing street corn and bread entree. The food was incredible! We ate until we were completely stuffed.  Outdoor seating is available and our service was friendly. We can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"There was a lot to like about Everly. The food was interesting and delicious, and they had a lot to offer vegetarians and gluten-free eaters. Everyone enjoyed their food. However, we went on a nice night and decided to sit out on the porch. Apparently, Everly allows their patrons to bring dogs on the porch. A couple with a giant and poorly behaved dog sat down at the table next to us near the end of our meal and we spent the rest of our time with the dog sniffing around our plates and our laps. Not exactly pleasant. Another Patron with a dog sat at the outdoor bar which meant that servers and customers alike had to step over her dog and leash the entire time. It's an extremely confusing business model to have dogs run off the rest of your customers, and I would only go back there in the winter when the porch is closed. Maybe some restaurants do a good job of allowing dogs, but as Everly's porch is enclosed, there is no way to do it well."}
{"text":"I brought my sister for lunch to Everly, she had the pest pasta and I had the beet banh mi with smoked salmon and the truffle fries and wow those two dishes were truly amazing! Our waitress was amazing and super accommodating about adding things to dishes and about recommending dishes. The atmosphere is so beautiful, yet simple and allows for a great experience at the restaurant, allowing you to forget how difficult was to get there due to Monroe construction! Definitely an amazing and worth it place to visit!"}
{"text":"I visited Everly with some friends a while back but just now getting around to writing a review. I was so impressed with nearly everything about this place. Everything was so professionally done that it almost didn't feel like a neighborhood restaurant. We got there early and even though there wasn't room to sit at the bar it took no time at all to catch the eye of a bartender. My only negative critique is the size of the wine pour relative to the price. I appreciate the fact that the bar was trained to pour a precisely calculated pour but I'd rather pay an extra buck and feel like I got a generous pour. Also, for me, I'd prefer to have a small selection of popular national liquor brands in addition to the smaller craft brands. Lots of credit though for sourcing and supporting the small guys. Overall small concerns in light of such a positive experience. Everyone was friendly and our server was so pleasantly enthusiastic about the food and made lots of suggestions. We were with a vegetarian and there were plenty of vegetarian options that we were able to share among the group. The plates were small but it was nice to choose several options. After sharing vegetarian apps, I was ready for some meat and chose the steak which was served with bone marrow butter. I was a little skeptical at first but it ended up being amazing. I told the server about what a pleasant surprise it was and she offered to give me some to take home! I declined but word must have gotten back to the rest of the staff and when we were asked about our meals on the way out, the host said he heard I liked the marrow butter and offered me some to take home a second time. While a little unusual, I thought it was as friendly as you would expect from a neighborhood restaurant as it was professional and high end like you would expect from a fancy downtown restaurant. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Went back to give this place another try after a lackluster first experience. The good news is that all the good things about our first visit held true: pleasant hostess, pretty modern design, lots of windows, attentive wait staff, lots of options for dietary restrictions.  We avoided the items that we tried the first time and opted for heartier sounding entrees. Unfortunately, the food was still a bit hit or miss. Had a great fettuccine pasta dish as an appetizer followed by two mediocre grain dishes that were under seasoned. One came with grit as well, which is always unpleasant: overall, just not sure how to feel about the food..."}
{"text":"Love the brunch! The hotcake is so unique and delicious. I've also been a few times for lunch and dinner-have enjoyed the avocado toast, fries, and a few other dishes. There are a lot of traditional dishes with unusual twists. Service has always been good when we visited."}
{"text":"Very industrial with a very modern and clean decor. Service was very pleasant  from greet to check.  Came with a friend for a later Sunday Brunch and was not dissapointed. I know, I know, I'm not a fan of Food Fight as a company, but they seem to have brunch figured out.  Food is a little pricey, I'm not sure if it's worth it. The food was good, don't get me wrong, but $8 for granola and yogurt doesn't really make a lot of sense. Walking distance from Edgewood College, Everly, might be boxing out their largest demographic.   Menu is a revitalized version of old favorites. Might be a tad too trendy, but time will tell."}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome! Our server was so nice and very accommodating with my dietary restrictions (pescetarian). She let me know the kitchen is flexible and can make the oysters w/out bacon, etc.   I had the salmon sandwich (super glad I tried it, but would probably opt to put the apple slices in my kale salad next time) and my boyfriend had the half chicken which looked so good I seriously considered having a bite of it.  Cool, trendy atmosphere with a great selection of wine/beer. For two entrees and two drinks it came to $70 w/tip which is reasonable in my opinion for a nice dinner. Because of the open floorplan, the acoustics can get a little loud, but nothing to stop you from going.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of small and large plates. Our table of 4 shared 2 orders of the fried chicken, and it was very tasty, although mine could have benefitted from a little more meat on the bones.   For my main meal I had a burger and a kale side. The burger was very tasty but I was more surprised by how much I enjoyed the kale. It wasn't over prepared -- simply warmed with some oil and maybe a little spices. It was delicious. I am a recent kale convert and i typically prefer to disguise it in a smoothie, so this should be considered high praise. :)  I will remember this restaurant fondly as my dining mates were 3 lovely former coworkers who I had not seen in 15 years. We had a thoroughly enjoyable time reminiscing, and our waitress never rushed us to free up the table. Thanks for contributing to a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Saturday not realizing the menu would be primarily brunch. No matter - it was all delicious. Minor quibbles: my dining partner had the smoked whitefish soft scrambled eggs which were good but the eggs were definitely not soft. He was not given a choice of bread either and was served white bread toast. Surprised that whole grain bread was not offered. My lots of grains hotcake was delicious except it came already dripping with maple syrup, butter and powdered sugar. I am sure I'm not the only one who is cutting down on sugar and would've preferred to have the option to determine how much, if any, maple syrup to add. A very surprising choice for a restaurant that bills itself as California healthy."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant hit the nail on the head. We found a parking spot easily (although I could see how that might be a problem in the small lot), we were greeted from a friendly host, seated right away (with a call ahead reservation), brought waters, and got our food promptly. I also liked that it seemed like any of the staff were willing to help any of the tables, as opposed to not feeling comfortable asking another person to bring more water as they're walking by your table.  The bar area and inside decor was swanky AF. The food was really fresh and high quality. The staff seemed well-trained and well-informed about the menu items, and the menu wasn't overwhelming with number of choices. Although, a few different items intrigued me, I ended up with the fettuccine, and dang it was good. I'd be back to try another meal other than dinner."}
{"text":"Hangtown Fry, do yourself a favor and check 'er out. Sooo good.  Also tried the smoked salmon and avocado benedict, which was also really good.   Moved away to Santa Cruz right after discovering this place, but when I'm back for business I will make sure to stop in. :)  I would totally recommend adding another benedict option, fried crabcake bendict would be delicious."}
{"text":"Been to Everly twice in the past month -- first time with a friend and we dined in, second time for carry out. Dining in was a much more positive experience. The drinks, food and service were all good, four stars. The second experience went like this: call in order at 5:40 pm for two main courses, told it would take 20-30 minutes. Arrive 23 minutes later expecting I'd have to wait but the food is ready, without utensils or napkins in the bag and no offer to give me any, either. I asked the bartender/server for utensils, and she seemed somewhat surprised by my request but went to the kitchen to get me some plasticware. But that's all it was -- no napkins. Know how plasticware is usually wrapped in a napkin when you get carryout? Nope, not here. So I ask, \"Do you have napkins?\" Her response: more surprise. \"Only the little cocktail napkins.\" Um, no thanks. In the restaurant they use cloth so I suppose they don't feel it's necessary to carry paper napkins. By the time I drove the 5-10 minutes back to work to eat, both meals were cold. Stone cold. In terms of good quality, this time it was just meh. But maybe that's because it was cold.   Here's my beef: if you're going to charge $10-20 per meal (not big plates, either) and offer carryout, then do it right. I'd rather arrive early for my food and know it's fresh so it's somewhat hot when I eat it. And when I pick up food for carry out, I want paper napkins and utensils. I can get that much from Qdoba for a fraction of the price.  Everly, if you're going to be a classy restaurant you've got to step up your game. I expect better service for these prices."}
{"text":"I wanted a visiting friend to experience Madison vegetarian food in a modern, sleek atmosphere. Everly definitely fit the bill. Two in our party were meat eaters that enjoy vegetarian food, and one is a pescatarian.   The atmosphere was airy and bright. Service was very prompt and kind.   The menu features great variety to satisfy veg heads and meat eaters alike. We opted to share the brussel sprouts as an app. They were tasty, but slightly under-roasted for all of our preferences.  We each had a toast:  -Avocado with salmon: Gorgeous plate! A few too many red onions and parsley could've been chopped finer, but the generous thin sliced fresnos added just the right amount of heat.  -Tomato brurata: The tomatoes weren't the most vibrant, but decent given the season is turning. The corn added a really nice flavor and texture note.  -Mushroom: I thought this sounded heavy, but it was rather light. A mushroom jus added just the right lightness.   We enjoyed two craft cocktails: Pied piper and Bubbles & stuff. The Bubbles was the favorite of the two, though both were very good.  A very solid 4 star visit. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Really beautiful, trendy new place in Madison! Seems like Monroe Street is up and coming and Everly is a lovely addition to Madison's restaurant scene.   Ambiance: 5/5. Cool, relaxing, and very Instagrammable. Everly incorporates organic elements into its interior design with lots of natural lighting, beautiful wood tables, and flora on the walls while also incorporating contemporary aspects that look straight out of a Pinterest board (think fancy Ikea). Gorgeous ceramic dishware, plush leather chairs, and a good playlist also sold me.  Service: 5/5. Waitress was incredibly attentive and had no problem splitting up the bill for a party of 4 with people who shared different items. Definitely could have been a nightmare but avoiding this was awesome and much appreciated.  Food: 4/5. While the presentation was beautiful and many of the menu items intrigued me (was literally salivating looking at the menu), the overall flavor and execution was good, but not phenomenal. I could tell a lot of thought went into the flavor combinations that went into each item, but not all of it worked for me. Everything was so close to being perfect and I really feel like could get there with a few tweaks! A few individual item reviews below:  -Brussel Sprouts: Yum! Very tasty creamy white sauce and the slight burnt edge was a fun extra flavor punch. Would taste even better with garlic thrown in there (psst, Everly!)   -Beets: Exquisite display with incredible colors, but only decent taste. The orange creme fraiche was a little weird to me, but the grapefruit with beets were delicious!  -Tuna Sandwich: Order this!!! Super tasty bread, wonderful roasted peppers, and great texture contrast with the cucumber and tuna. Comes with either potatoes (which were a little too burnt for me) or sautéed kale (with surprisingly a lot of flavor).  -Pork Sandwich: Not actually a sandwich, but comes on a bun? The cole slaw in there was super tasty but the pork itself was a little dry and lacking flavor.   -Blueberry Matcha Latte: Interesting and glad I got to try it, but probably wouldn't order it again. The blueberry is actually quite fragrant and the milk is really smooth, but I think it would be hard to drink an entire latte of this flavor.   Overall, I was glad I got to try Everly and especially with a rotating menu, I would love to return. Prices are pretty reasonable, the place feels clean and welcoming, and the service is great. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Fantastic menu! What west side Madison's been waiting for, ie Grain bowls; fresh; veggie-centric. Frankly, I still see far too many menu's not matching Madison's diverse tastes, we've been beyond meat & potatoes for many years.  Just hope they bring back the fish toast ;)"}
{"text":"It seems like someone read an article on what's trendy in restaurants and tried to shove as much of it into one space as possible: open kitchen, community tables, dish towel napkins, cleverly named cocktails, avacado toast, etc. It hits all the trends but feels forced and inauthentic.  I love the idea of getting healthy fare while eating out, and maybe flavor is a necessary trade off, but I was underwhelmed with my choices, though my friend loved his salmon."}
{"text":"Went to Everly for dinner the other day and it was good, but I was not overly impressed.  Decor was nice, I was so happy I had a booth because the tables seemed SO close together.   Cocktails: good, not spectacular.   Appetizer: Fried Mozz Gnocchi was amazing! Price was a little steep for 5 little pieces of gnocchi, but the dish was tasty and the sauce was delicious.   Dinner: My boyfriend got the pasta with sage and sausage, it was terrific! I got the spicy tuna pasta and it was okay. Clearly they went over to miko poke next door to grab some of the little bits of tuna. The sauce tasted like someone mixed canned alfredo with a lot of sriracha. No bueno. Portions are pretty small. Appetizer and dinner and I was still kinda hungry after.   Service was great, apart from making the reservation. Why do you have staff answer the phone who are unable to take a reservation? Was put on hold for 4 min and told we could only be at a high top table. Thank goodness the nice host found us a booth when we arrived instead!   Overall okay, not great. Would give this another try and want to try their brunch."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful! I loved the outdoor bar with the white marble countertop. Such an aesthetically pleasing place. Their food was really good and loved that their menu was built of healthier food options and fresh tasting ingredients. I will say that we went on a Monday so it was a little understaffed so we had to wait a while to order. But all in all is recommended checking this place out."}
{"text":"Skip this place - it would be easy to find something better! Four of us came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. We were excited to try Everly because it's new and sounded interesting. All of us were disappointed with our dishes. Especially bad was the Crispy Rice Bowl which tasted like dry rice that was impossible to eat. The Chilaquiles mexican inspired dish was too spicy and the flavors did not mix well. As a true eggs benedict fan, my husband had the Smoked Salmon and Avocado Benedict. This was not a blend of food that should have gone together and the mushed avocado smothered the taste of everything else. I had a simple Chicken Sandwich, which tasted like dry canned chicken placed on soggy toast. Everly is trying too hard to be trendy when it should focus first on ensuring the basics of good-tasting, quality food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem slightly removed from Downtown and I would take guests here if you are looking for causal and nice, slightly upscale (but not fancy) atmosphere and they are looking for locally-sourced food with rotating menus.   The atmosphere and offerings are somewhat similar to Graze in Downtown, except you get more of a California-like vibe at Everly. Also, I personally find the food here to be to my liking than Graze because their offerings is slightly larger and they seem to rotate their menus more frequently; but this is a matter of personal taste. Among my vegetarian friends, they say that Everly's vegetarian offerings are far better and tastier than other places in town. I also find their non-vegetarian offerings to be great and I was never disappointed with the food. The service was excellent and the waiters/waitresses were friendly. I felt like I could sit here for hours, enjoy a nice meal + drinks, catch up with guests, and leave very satisfied. I would recommend this place to friends who are  looking for a tasty, nice, but casual dinner.  A side note: parking can be tricky here and you can find additional parking along the local roads close to Wingra park."}
{"text":"This is probably the best brunch I've had in Madison. With a simple menu, everything is focused and well thought out. My boyfriend bought the bacon and egg hash and hasn't stopped talking about it since we went there 2 weeks ago.   I bought the Elote + eggs and can confidently say as a relocated Texan, they do it darn well. The patio is quiet and beautiful and I can't think of a better place to eat!"}
{"text":"We, unfortunately, had a negative experience at Everly when we came for brunch this Saturday.  I should start by saying that the service was excellent and the space is very nice. Our waitress, the hostess and the general manager were all great.  The problem is that both my wife and I both became very sick after eating at Everly. About an hour after eating my wife started vomiting and I also became sick to my stomach as well. Everly was the only thing we had eaten at the the time. We suspect it may have been the smoked salmon and avocado benedict (the salmon tasted a bit off) or the whitefish tuna toast.    We're still very sick at 8pm at night. We hope they get this problem sorted out before it affects other customers."}
{"text":"Best black bean burger in Madison - made in house. Super friendly, prompt service and delicious happy hour drinks. By recommendation of our waitress, I got the kale salad as a side which was sooo good (yes, I'm talking about KALE). Will be back so many times this summer to hopefully snag a spot on the patio!"}
{"text":"We had brunch here and found their menu to be a refreshing change from the heavy gastropub fare that has been all too typical around town. Many of the menu items had healthy ingredients listed such as fresh avocado, sprouts, quinoa, cold smoked salmon, kale...it was tough to narrow down a final choice. Not everything listed was uber healthy, which seemed like a good balance. We forgot to take pics of our entrees but we did remember to take a pic of the toast we ordered. I'd recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Took my very traditional boyfriend there .... started reading the menu and giggled. He found something he may like ... his only complaint was the fork. :) if this guy didn't complain -- y'all know it's wonderful food! I had the caramelized granola ...delicious."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. Their brunch options are better than lunch. Haven't tried their dinner menu yet. Drinks are a bit pricey but other than that I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I am pleased to report that Everly is back to form.  We had outstanding service at lunch today - timely, attentive, and pleasant.  We enjoyed the frites, the mozzarella gnocchi, kale salad, and the butternut squash curry - all outstanding.  I have no reservations about recommending Everly."}
{"text":"Food is actually nice. It also has many vegetarian options. Don't expect a heavy meal here. Drinks have a limited menu. It was busy and slow to get attention. However, once we had someone attend to is, she was very nice!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice: once for a pre-Badger basketball game and once for Restaurant Week lunch.  My dinner experience was much better.   For dinner we tried to make reservations, but it was already full. The hostess recommended we still come and sit at the bar. My friend and I were promptly seated at the beautiful bar. Gorgeous decor and large list of cocktails and wines (I'm not a beer drinker). The bartenders were very knowledgeable on their drink and food menus and were the perfect blend of attentive and friendly. We had the fried artichoke starter which was so-so- the coating was a bit off. But the dinner really packed a punch.   I had the Nor Cal sandwich with roasted herb potatoes- the veggies were so fresh. The bread was amazing but could have used a bit more of the tahini sauce as it was just a smudge dry. The potatoes were heavenly. Very good portion as I was stuffed and couldn't finish.   My friend had the Squash Forbidden Rice Curry and loved it. I had a bite and the curry flavor was impeccable. Great experience.   Restaurant Week Lunch was a bit of a miss (but not terrible enough for me to write it off) the problem is it just took a long time for the four of us to be served our meal. I will hall this up to the business of restaurant week. We all had the So Cal Grain bowl. The server/kitchen was kind enough to let me customize my egg instead of over easy. The volcano sauce on the side was delicious, but used sparingly as its very vinegar-y. I had the chocolate mouse for dessert and it was so light and fluffy with a hint of orange. I'm not normally a dessert person, but this wrapped up the lunch very nicely.   Looking forward to checking it out when the weather is nicer and the outdoor bar and patio are open.   Pros: great ambience, extensive cocktail and wine list, vegetarian friendly  Cons: Lunch service could take a while"}
{"text":"Everly is pretty legit and a nice addition to Monroe. I've now been three times (brunch, dinner, and for outdoor cocktails): all 3 have been lovely with excellent food and service.   On the brunch menu, the standout items are the avocado toast and the nor-cal sandwich. Both have lots of flavor and great toppings. The brunch drinks are a bit pricey, so I went with cider last time I went. I love the focus on wine, but all of their wine comes at a premium price. It would be cool to see some more affordable wines added to the list.   Dinner was also great, although brunch was the real frontrunner here. For dinner, I tried the farro risotto and roasted cauliflower. The cauliflower was great, the farro was a bit dry.   Everly opens the opposite side of their bar when it's warm out, which another real highlight. I got to enjoy a few drinks on one of the warm weekends in April and can't wait to see the place in full swing.   This place is one I'll keep coming back to."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, nice atmosphere but a little breezy by the entrance, comfy chairs, GREAT craft cocktails, and good food. Menu had a broad variety and lots of choices for non-meat eaters. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, went a few days ago and got my favorite dish, the mushroom toast, and it was so awful! I couldn't believe how soggy the new bread is- it's nothing like toast! Especially with an already soggy food, the texture was almost vomit inducing. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and wow, this time was even better!  We had 3 different entrees, the salmon, flat iron steak & half chicken - all 3 really delicious! Everyone loved theirs! The potatoes were also extremely tasty. It's also well priced, each was under $20 and nice atmosphere, especially in good weather with the open air dining and patio."}
{"text":"EVERLY. You remind me of my time in Los Angeles visiting my sister. Your food is unique and different. Your service is pretty great. I've been here twice for brunch. The first time - 5 stars. The second time - 3. I'm splitting the difference here with a 4.   My absolute favorite thing about this place is the salmon. It's \"smoked\" but it really tastes like fresh sushi grade salmon - almost like sashimi. When I moved here from Boston I was TERRIFIED to eat fish. Honestly. Although I grew up in the midwest, once you live on a coast you resign yourself to the fact that you'll never eat good seafood again unless you're back there. Thanks to Everly for proving me wrong.   I was a bit frustrated at brunch with the quality of the vegetables and the potatoes. They honestly tasted like they had been reheated in a microwave. Considering everything else was so fresh, this was a huge disappointment. But, everyone is allowed to have an off day. I'd certainly check this place out. The ambiance if nothing else, is really cool. A great place to sit on the patio in the summer and enjoy some great brunch cocktails and FANTASTIC salmon benedict. Is there anything better in life than a salmon benedict?"}
{"text":"Best meal of my life!!!! Seriously I am at a loss for words because my experience was just so amazing!"}
{"text":"This incredibly Californian world is definitely an unforgettable experience, even when the food sometimes might be. Everything from the styling of the menus to the colors, the furniture down to the actual organic and gluten free items themselves are reminiscent of an old west coast trip.   Got the whitefish egg scramble and it was pretty good. Their drinks are really good and have a lot of variety.   Highly recommended for patrons with dietary restrictions - they make you feel welcome and suspend all judgement on your choices.   I'd be remiss if I did not talk about the trendy bar which extends outdoors as well. I fully intend to check it out once the weather in Wisconsin matches the style of the decor."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and even better service.  We stopped here after a day out by the lake and it well worth it.  Prices are a little high, but it'll be well worth it.  Even though complain about service, it's difficult to do that regarding this restaurant.  We felt at all teams taken care of!  It's our hope to return again this summer!"}
{"text":"We came here for a late brunch and ordered the house burger and house salad. Definitely throw on the extra egg! One complaint is that both of our burgers were heavily charred. Had we not added the eggs, I'm sure that that is all that we would have tasted. My other complaints would be that they only refilled our drinks once, never checked in to see how are meals were, and there was no toilet paper in the bathroom. I've been here before, and remembered a much better experience, but for this one, I just left kinda bummed."}
{"text":"This is a lovely discovery. I miss the old Bluephies that used to be in this space, but after the management decided to take a break and sell the space, I hoped the new restaurant would be equally good. Thank goodness it is. I had the salmon dinner and it was really tasty. The menu is Californian (so a healthier slant to a menu) and I found the appetizers that we got and split all were tasty. Also the atmosphere is \"slightly more fancy\" than standard causal, but it's easily a place for causal dining as well."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way out of town for a quick lunch. My boyfriend got a tuna sandwich which was pretty good. I ended up getting the Crispy Rice Bowl. It was intriguing but ended up being literally painful to eat.   I'm not sure what I expected when I ordered 'crispy rice' but this was literally a dish of brittle rice with a fried egg on top. There is a side dish in Persian cuisine of crispy rice - when cooking rice you let the rice at bottom of the pot harden and get crispy, then serve it on the side. I'm no stranger to crispy rice but this was really rough on the teeth to eat as my main course.   There were a few pieces that had a crisp outer shell with soft rice on the inside - I think the whole dish should have been this way so it could have been enjoyable. Do not get the Crispy Rice Bowl. I left extremely unsatisfied.   The interior was pretty cute and modern though and they had a big bar that faced both outside and inside. A spacious patio exists as well. For a restaurant in a strip mall, it was pretty nicely designed.   Service was just okay - our server was predominantly outside serving the patio so it took a bit of a long time to track her down for the check."}
{"text":"Have been here 4-ish times since it opened: brunch, lunch, and dinner  Particularly at its slightly lower price point, leaps ahead of anything else in Madison. It has a clear California concept (complete with luxury toasts) that differentiates from other farm-to-table type restaurants in Madison. It's subtle but also transports you just enough... and when the giant windows open in the spring I imagine it'll be an even stronger concept.  Beers and wines are California heavy. I'm not a huge fan of hop-filled beers, so not ideal for me (but definitely on brand for what they're going for). Mixed drinks have all been solid -- particularly enjoy that they have an alcoholic creamsicle, which is just fun.   The standout at every meal has been the vegetable sides... would definitely get at least two every meal.   Of the three meals, brunch was probably the weakest of the three... which likely says more about my thoughts on brunch than anything else.  Bottom Line: It's a unique concept for Madison that I could imagine succeeding in any city in the US -- no need to lower standards in Madison... and can eat relatively healthily at the same time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a lunch here, would highly recommend the food. The service was great as well. A little bit pricier than some but I would like to try more here. The mushroom dish was excellent and I also had a very nice sandwich."}
{"text":"Ultimately underwhelming and overpriced food in a nicely designed restaurant.  It is indeed lovely that they have many options for vegan and GF foodies."}
{"text":"Holy cow this was delish!   I'd been wanting to check out Everly foreverly now ;) Finally stopped in tonight and I was not disappointed!   For starters, the restaurant itself is pretty neat. Very open, light, and airy. Lots to look at even though it's done in a modern simplistic way. Loads of natural light, garage doors that open to the outdoor section, cool lighting, and even a live wall. Super cool.   Now the food. Ummmm hello! So good! We started with truffle fries. Crispy, salty, perfectly cooked. Lots of flavor and served with a super creamy and tasty dipping sauce.   I went with the salmon for my main, and my boyfriend got the pot roast. The pot roast (or at least the few bites he sacrificed to me) was incredible. I will for sure be ordering this next time. My salmon was also fantastic. It was perfectly seared and had a nice crispness on the outside. It came with Brussels sprouts that were super flavorful.   We ended the meal with a shared sundae. It's not often that we spring for dessert, but we just had to. The sundae was amazing! It came was a warm cookie and blackberry compote. Yassss. So good.    Overall - very pleased with everything. Check this place out!"}
