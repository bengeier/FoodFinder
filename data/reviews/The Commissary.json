{"text":"My husband and I stopped for Saturday brunch and although the decor and waiter were welcoming, the quality of the food was disappointing...particularly after reading some of the rave reviews. We both had the lobster eggs Benny and the sauce was very good...but the lobster was overcooked and dry while the mango for the salsa was under-ripe, too crunchy and bitter.  It lacked brightness and flavour. Also, there were large amounts of grounds in my coffee...which was just off putting."}
{"text":"Went to Commissary today for brunch and was totally underwhelmed. I got the steak & eggs which is eggs bene with roast beef. My friend got the Monte Cristo and my wife the lobster eggs bene.   My eggs appeared undercooked but my dish was decent. My wife's lobster eggs bene had a yolk missing and the other yolk was overcook. The lobster was lost somewhere underneath and not really incorporated into the dish. My friend's Monte Cristo came encased in 2 egg soaked buns that were completely soaked through and barely cooked. Also didn't help that we got our dishes almost 1.5 hrs after we ordered. Not even a peep from the wait staff on the long wait.  The guy beside us left in disgust leaving behind his completely burnt and black french toast. The wait staff didn't even clear it away so everyone could see it.  New restaurant so I can understand some kinks to get out but that's no excuse for extremely poorly executed food and poor communication. Seems to me like the owner doesn't know much about running a restaurant. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had brunch with a group of girlfriends and everything was fantastic. I had the eggs bene with smoked applewood bacon and gouda - yum! It was served with small roast potatoes and the perfect amount of salad & fruit to freshen things up. Everyone in the group enjoyed their food and the service was excellent. The only thing that dropped my rating from a 5 to a 4 was that the hollandaise was on the thick, white and creamy side and not very tasty. But I will definitely be back again. Next time I'd like to try a french toast style croissant!"}
{"text":"Went there with my friend, on a Friday evening, looking for a girl night out. The place is nice, service is kind, but it was almost empty... Did we arrive too late (8pm)?  We had the mussels and the ravioli with parmesan and olive oil. The mussels were delicious. The ravioli were good and fresh, but I wondered if it was a starter or an entrée (it was an entrée) as the portion was ridiculously small for a 20$+ pasta, that I can cook exactly the same at home.   I liked my dinner, but found it really overpriced!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out after it changed from the previous french bistro style place that was there before.  I like the name, the interior is not bad (not much of a change from what was there previously), and it seems to have all the makings for a successful little restaurant.    Problem is, I never got to try the food.  After a 45 minute wait during the lunch hour, we gave up after not even having been served the drinks we ordered.  If I recall, there's also 15 minute guarantee or something like that for some items.  It's a good idea but from my experience, it's pointless to have something like that when you can't even get your drinks within 15 minutes.  In fairness to them, it was packed and the waiter did indicate that it was his first day and was \"learning the ropes.\"  With that said, customers still shouldn't be made to wait like that with not even so much as a courteous check-in from the staff to say, \"it'll be right with you\" or something to that regard.  Too bad as I was really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Simply excellent.  Drove by quite a few times, wondering when they would open.  They are now on \"day 28\" (as the waiter told us after inquiring) and all we can say is \"wow\".   Food quality is excellent - well above our expectations.  Wait staff courteous, attentive (but not overly so).  Food arrived quickly and cooked perfectly.  Price point: value for the dollar, definitely.  The breakfast sandwich was perfectly cooked eggs with bacon on a croissant, served with a wonderful salad.  Cost: only $7.  Coffee (our biggest gripe at many \"brunch\" places:  excellent.  Look forward to returning often.  What a gem."}
{"text":"Staff and owners are amazing and the food is out of this world! Lobster Benny and stuffed french toast are my favourites but I've tried almost everything on the brunch menu and have never been disappointed! By far, the best brunch in Leslieville"}
{"text":"great hollandaise sauce, great service, $5 fresh squeezed OJ mimosa (on special) and lobster eggs benny, amazing. took my sister there and stole some of her apple-brie french toast, there was some sandwich that looked amazing.   let's conclude i'll be back and may end up ordering to items next time. and also, the place was only 3/4 full when lady marmalade had a line-up out the door. nothin wrong with that."}
{"text":"Arrived here just before 2:30 on Sunday for brunch - they serve brunch until 4 pm.  We arrived just as basically a wave of the entire restaurant was paying, so we waited about 6 minutes or so for a table.  Not too bad!  They had run out of a lot of things on the menu, but the server was very apologetic (no more croissants, two of the egg dishes, we got the last order of potatoes!).    Everything else despite this one hiccup was excellent.  Service was friendly and as efficient as possible, considering there was basically one server for the whole place.  I had the mushroom and cheddar omelette and it was delicious - big, full mushrooms, not slices like usual.   Caesars were only $4.95 each!  The potatoes came roasted with red peppers and onions and were yum.  I didn't drink a coffee, but my dining companion said it was above average.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten in 3 or 4 times and ordered for pick up 5 or 6 times (there aren't many healthy lunch options in this area.)  The food has been good (hence the 3 stars) but not consistent - for example, the curried shrimp and melon salad has been different every single time...once it came with garlic shrimp instead.  It was take-out so I didn't find out until I was back at work.   Today, 45 minutes after placing my order for pick up (they said it would be 20 or 25) I was informed that they didn't have the soup I wanted.  I opted to not wait any longer and just go for the salad that I had ordered.  Then I was informed they didn't have that either.  I went elsewhere.    Not sure if I'll give them another chance but in an area that desperately needs lunch options, if they get on top of their service issues they'll likely be a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about another soup, salad, sandwich bistro/brunch place opening up in the 'hood.  There seem to be so many of them in the area!  However, I was happily surprised when I came here for lunch.  First off, I found my server to be professional, efficient, friendly and gracious.  Since the resto wasn't too busy, he and I struck up a nice conversation, which is always nice.  I went there for lunch and ordered the Leslie sandwich, which has herbed ratatouille and arugula in a whole grain tortilla.  The ratatouille was delish and the wrap was nicely grilled.  The wrap was a bit messy with the veggies producing a lot of juice.  I added the watercress-apple-jicama slaw salad, which was awesome.  The fruits and veggies were fresh and the dressing was delish and well applied!  For a side, I felt like i had a full portion.   It felt like a steal for only 4 dollars more - definitely recommend getting the side salad!   I believe they've applied for a liqour license and will be expanding their evening menu once they can host after-work drinkers!  I'm looking forward to seeing where they take the menu and hope they're going to be bold with the drinks menu.   Welcome to the hood, Commissary!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today for a quick lunch.  I had the Commisary Sandwich (turkey sandwich).  They were out of Turkey, so it actually was made with a chicken breast... which might actually have been better than the turkey!  The sandwich was delicious, and the service was great.  I'm looking forward to checking out Slow Food Sundays!  Sounds sooooo good."}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant for a couple weeks waiting for it to open. I used to go to Sophie Mon Petit Cafe for a quick mid-day coffee, but when it closed I was glad to hear another cafe-bistro was taking it's place. Today when I walked by they were finally open, so I was able to give them a try.  Upon entering, I was greeted by the cheerful owner with a big smile and welcome. All the tables were taken, so I chose to sit at the counter and was promptly asked if I would like anything to drink and was handed a brunch menu. It was recommended to be to have the PB&J on french toast, but I went with the eggs benedict with roast beef and peppercorn with just a tap water to drink. The water was given to me in a glass bottle with a Tap Water logo on the side and a description of it, I thought that was pretty neat; made me laugh a little in my head, but I also read what it had to say.  I don't know exactly how long it was, but I didn't even have a chance to have a full look around the place before my food arrived. The aroma was great on the senses and the portion was a very nice size; not overly huge, but the plate was full. On first bite, I was in heaven. I didn't know what to expect from a new place nor how they would combine roast beef and eggs benedict, but it was done really well. There was a thin toasted bun underneath, the roast beef on top of that, and the eggs on top of that - all with home fries on the side. There was something with the taste of the roast beef that had my mouth doing loops, which after asking I found out was because they used green peppercorns which are soft and edible and give a much better flavour...note to self. I have recently (the last 6 months or so) just got into eggs, so I don't have a huge frame of reference, but I very impressed. The potatoes were a little under seasoned, but it didn't detract from the overall taste of the meal.  Sitting right next to me on the counter was a counter-top display of cookies, and I am not one that can resist a big cookie. I went with a chocolate chip cookie and it was recommended to me to try it with a white hot chocolate...a restaurant after my sweet tooth! I had never had a white hot chocolate before, but it was really good. Tasted like white chocolate flavoured milk which made a perfect dip for the cookie. The whole mid-afternoon meal left me thoroughly satisfied.  Being a new place, of course it was clean and everything looked great. I like that they left the old chalkboard up that Sophie had. I have been to the opening weekend of a few restaurants in my time, and usually they are not run quite so efficiently. Because everyone is still learning there is usually a lot of confusion or frustration, but everyone was all smiles even though every table was full. Based on the full flavoured food that I tasted, I am excited to go back and try the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I was really planning to make my first visit to The Commissary on a weekend for brunch, but I changed my plan when I needed a late casual lunch in the neighborhood on a weekday.  Since they are in the process of getting their LLBO, they are only open till 4pm daily.  The two of us walked into this small cafe just after 3 for a quick lunch.  The lady greeted us casually but politely and suggested we take a seat anywhere we like.  There were maybe one other table at the time.  The lunch menu consisted of soups, flatbreads, sandwiches, and salads available in two sizes.  We ordered:  Watercress, Jicama & Granny Smith Apple Salad: $5 side (5/5 stars) I subbed the apple for pear instead.  Fresh greens with fine juliennes of fresh juicy pear and delicious apple cider dressing.  I'm not usually a salad person, but the menu made them sound really good, so I decided to try a couple small sizes.  Great portion for the price and quality!  Curried Shrimp & Melon: $6 (3.5/5 stars) Two perfectly grilled jumbo shrimps with a light and non-spicy curry sauce, fresh greens, and refreshingly sweet honey dew.  It was served with a light red wine vinaigrette, which was good but almost too plentiful for me (I usually like very little dressing).  Pear & Watercress Soup: $6.50 (4.5/5 stars) I wanted to try all the soups, but decided to go with this one assuming it was a unique and lighter choice.  It was served in a big bowl with all the ingredients you can still see!  I love it when I can actually see what I am eating and taste it.  Refreshing and delicious!  The Stone Sandwich: $9 (3/5 stars) Roast beef sammy with greens and horseradish aioli on a panini.  It was okay to me, but much more appreciated by my lunch date.  I guess it was just missing a bit of roasty-ness to it.  The beef didn't quite taste \"roasted\" and lacked a bit of the horseradish zing that I really anticipated.  I definitely have had better.  Service: (5/5 stars) Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable.  I'm not usually a soup and sandwich girl.  I mean, I like each of them on their own but not together as a meal.  It's sort of... boring to me.  However, I really like the fresh and \"try-to-go local\" menu.  The prices are fair for the portion and quality, so I am definitely coming back when I  want a simple healthy meal.  But before that, BRUNCH!"}
{"text":"This place has piqued my curiosity for a while now, so I was happy to have a chance to stop by for dinner.  It was a Thursday night around 7 and the place was very quiet which I found a bit unnerving.  But it turned out to be fine.  I ordered the Caprese salad which was very simple, fresh, and respectable.  Nothing mind blowing, but good. I had the ravioli for my main which was also good though again, the flavours were very familiar...almost too familiar.  My date ordered the special which was a butter chicken pot pie, and it looked great! I'm sorry I didn't go with what he had.  The place itself was really cute, and our service was good.  I would be very willing to come back here and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Brunch was fantastic.   Lobster eggs Benny. Lobster watercress salad. Mmmmmmmmmm"}
