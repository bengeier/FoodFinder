{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER! Ranch is damn good too! Favorite thing to get is the buffalo chicken ranch fries and a mini pizza with mushrooms! This place has ruined pizza for me, other pizza places don't taste the same anymore."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Amazing food and price is incredibly low. I love this place. Even though I live a million miles away, this is the only place for me."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I can only speak for the wings. Very reasonably priced in regards to wings. Was ready by the time we got there (around 5 minutes). Food was pretty good. No Buffalo Wild Wings, but it gets the job done.  If you are tight on money, but are ravenous, this place dishes it out. Didn't even finish the wings there were so many (but cheap)."}
{"text":"Great value! The salad pizza is perfect if you're like me and don't care much for red sauce. The wings are delicious and you won't find a deal for 40 wings cheaper than you can find here. They will even let you choose more than one flavor if you call rather than order online."}
{"text":"Love it! You can enjoy great pizza and delicious chicken wings as well as  more healthy options like their salads and wraps! I particularly like the sweet chilli wings and the Cesar salad wrap! I recommend it! Ohhh and don't forget the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream!!! Gosh! It's to die for!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get pizza and wings!  They are always very friendly and know what they are doing!  I don't get cravings for pizza, I get cravings for Rkidds Pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area their wings are not bad as well ..the people that work there are really friendly and helpful ... Will be coming back to this play for my future pizza needs... PS their deserts are amazing as well"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time, as I've moved into the area. We got the large one topping and 12 wings special for $15. Called it in, and it was ready in 15 minutes. Pizza was great, and the wings too. Well worth the money, everything was hot and fresh! We will be repeat customers here for sure."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place in town. My go-to when I want something quick and when I have family over at the last minute. Every time I place an order for pick up my order gets repeated back to me over the phone, when I pay for it and when they give it to me it's never wrong. It's the worse when you have to go back because your order was incorrect or something was missing. .not here. I had a large order and thought it was nice for someone to come around the counter and open the door for me. Not the 1st time. .another time a worker appeared to be on break eating and took a moment to open to door for me. It's the little things that make a huge difference. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Hot wings. I once ate 18 of them in a sitting. A solid A-.  Salads are very good. A-  Pizza is very good. The salad pizza is an experience. I give it a solid A. You will not find this taste anywhere else.   You should avoid the thin crust unless what you are looking for is a normal crust but with less dough. It was not crispy like thin crust should be."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wing, great price, this place has there act together! I order out about 6-7 times and Every time I when im told my order will be done it's done. On like other pizza places I've gone to they tell you it will be 20-30 min and you show up and your Order haven't even been put in and they don't even know what you order. If you haven't tried this place you should."}
{"text":"This place is dope. I am a out of state student and they sure do make you feel at home. My family flew out to visit me and had to bring them here. They made the experience that much better, the environment is very friendly and the food is great! On top of all of that, the prices are great!"}
{"text":"I've been following Royce (the owner of Rkidds) ever since he was working for Il Primo's on 51st and Bell, cause his passion for service and a good pizza is with him everyday he's working. So, If I want quality service (if you ask for something that's not on the menu, he'll go to the neighboring grocery shop and get it for you), and excellent pizza & wings (I've been eating pizza from NorCal to SoCal and I crave this every time I eat pizza), this is the place I go.   P.S. Ask for the Suicide-Asian wings (A mix between the Suicide and the Asian Hot wing sauces), and I guarantee you will come back for more.   P.S.S Royce also has a hot sauce that is 1000x hotter than the Atomic at Wing Stop or the Blazin' at Buffalo Wild Wings, it's not on the menu, but he always has a small amount stored in the back, just ask for the \"hottest sauce you got!\"."}
{"text":"One of the very Best Pizza and Wings that I have ever had and I am fat! Very impressed with the service and the price but most importantly I could not get over the great taste of the product. Perfect with football and beer."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best places for amazing wings and pizza!!! If you want the best pizza and wings in Phx. Then try this place out. We live up north and still make the drive! The chicken strips are fantastic and the kids love them!!!  If you like beyond HOOOOT wings! Try them. They are dangerous lol!!  TO HOT FOR ME!!!! Definitely try out Rkidds pizza and wings!!! Service was great and this place is always clean!! Just a FYI"}
{"text":"Had their pizza and wings yesterday and it's definitely worth trying this place. We live down the road and had never tried this restaurant. Gave it a try about 1 month ago after reading all the positive reviews and let me just say you can't go wrong! Wings have perfect flavor and the pizza crust even has a great taste. You can call in your order ahead and it will be ready for you to pick-up."}
{"text":"Solid pizza and wings for the price! Consistent in taste and service. Definitely beats the big pizza chain companies."}
{"text":"Can't beat a large 1-topping pizza and a dozen wings for $15... The pizza was pretty good and the wings were great. I think I just prefer pizza less fluffy and with more cheese. Other than that, the 15 minute wait was quick and the price was cheap. Definitely a nice change from Dominos or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Try the salad pizza. To die for. Combo it with some hot wings and you will not regret it.  The anti pasta salad as well as the Buffalo chicken salad are by far the best salads I've ever tasted. $5.50 large pepperoni pizzas are worth more in my opinion. I have Little Cesar and Domino's closer to me and I won't go to those places because of the quality of pizza and service here"}
{"text":"I really like this pizza and wings shop! They are very affordable and you don't sacrifice flavor or quality. I used to go to Little Caesars for get-togethers with friends for the price and ease but with Rkidds prices and taste I will never go back. My friends all agreed that for a good pizza and wings we go with Rkidds! I have always picked up my order but I wouldn't eat in the place as nice as everyone is it is a warm inside as they are cooking like crazy in there."}
{"text":"Pizza was bomb. Hot wings were bomb. Ranch is phenomenal.  I would visit this place again and recommend it to others. Service was good."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a pizza with extra garlic. Gotta love a place that uses fresh garlic.  This is a fantastic pie!"}
{"text":"The wings are beyond delicious here and reasonably priced. Highly recommend the honey BBQ wings and large pizza deal. Always fast, friendly and piping hot. We've ordered here several times and have never had anything less than a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Quick service made this dinner decision a good one. I ordered a large meat pizza, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I will definitely be back as it was affordable, quick, and tasty. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is due to the fact that they do not sell beer. I was perplexed as to why a pizza and wings restaurant didn't sell beer. Other than that, I loved everything."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I expect and I really enjoy it. The pizza tastes good for a great value. Don't expect this to be a sit down pizza place since the space is limited to two tables but that is the one thing I enjoy about it. Usually I order my pizza from here then walk next door to ranch market to get an horchata. There isn't delivery here but it is close enough for me to come by and pick up my order. Good pizza in the phoenix area is hard to come by and this place is usually a quick fix spot for me. What has me thrown off is that I feel there has been a change within their recipe within the past couple of years and remember the pizza being slightly better than it is now. Not to say that the pizza is bad but they are still worth the great deals that they offer. If you do lunch with someone here, pass up the lunch special and go in on a whole pepperoni pizza which usually only costs around 5 dollars."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings.  Beats any other competitor, not to mention their warm cookie with ice creams is a must try! Royce and everyone there are really nice.  I live out in Tolleson and make the drive just for the pizza and wings! Boneless sweet chili wings"}
{"text":"Was looking for a pizza place that was near by and I found this place. This place is sooo good!!! The service is quick and great. It isn't too expensive and you get your money's worth. I will definitely be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious and fair prices. Pizza is always good and has a good taste. They season the crust so its no need to leave the crust uneaten.  The star though is their Chipotle Honey wings. 1. Wings are always crispy 2. The chipotle honey sauce makes them addicting.   1 large & 24 wings for $20.99  For those times you gave a larger group or football game party ;-) 2 large 1 topping and 40 wings for $33.99.  They are happy to split the wing flavor sauces.  Have in mind their is very limited seating and its better to come for takeout.   Staff is very friendly and always accommodating"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my 12 dollar lunch. The zucchini was so greasy, and soggy. The Wings I ordered half and half and the BBQ tasted like they put BBQ sauce over the mild sauce. The Wings were about as cold as the dipping sauce and soggy as well... I am not a complainer, but this was not 12 dollars well spent."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD ! They have good pizza n wings for a reasonable price. They're fast n friendly n the cannolis are fab!"}
{"text":"The place was small. Nowhere for kids to have a good time at a pizza place. It was cheap but because it wasn't from-scratch dough either. It was like going to little Cesar's. It was okay but I was expecting more of an authentic pizza and something a little greater than what we had, considering the reviews. It's def. not a place to go and chill with a beer and some wings and great pizza on a Sunday afternoon. They don't even sell beer and don't even have fountain drinks. Kinda disappointing. Won't be back here again. Just looking for something different I guess."}
{"text":"I am a self declared wing snob. If it weren't for my health, I could eat 3 dozens all by myself. So I really mean it when I say that this place is the THE place for pizza and wings. The wings are a good size and the sauce is always on point. I definitely recommend for a Sunday Football dinner!"}
{"text":"Great service! OK, I have to admit, I over did it. Hubby and I stopped here for late lunch and I ordered the Buffalo salad again -as good as I remembered it : ) Aaand... I also ordered the meat pie, with jalapeños (large)... Aaaand... I realized I also wanted to try the wings! So I ordered some garlic Parmesan and honey chipotle... Everything was good and tasty, hard to pick a favorite... I'm hoping to be back soon and I am also hoping not to have to cook for the rest of the weekend : )"}
{"text":"I go almost every day. Fantastic food and even better service! I personally am a fan on their chicken bacon ranch wrap. But it's hard not to get pizza too. So many great choices!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a pizza and wings. The good is really good here and affordable. The owner is very knowledgeable and takes care if his customers."}
{"text":"Pretty standard cheap pizza and wings fare. Can get a large 1-topping and wings for less than $20, quite a deal. As others have said, not much seating so carry out is a good option. Service is friendly too."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick bite to eat as me and the kid were headed to the store. I always wanted to try this place and I'm glad I finally did! We just got the lunch special to share: two slices and a drink. Just a traditional pepperoni and a cheese for the boy - they were excellent! The seasoned crust was delicious and the sauce was excellent and they didn't over do it. Plus, the customer service was great. They went as far as to give me a third slice because the last slice of pepperoni was kind of small. We're moving from this area soon but we'll be returning to grab some RKidds!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for practically my whole 28yrs!! Delicious pizza and bomb wings!! Highly recommended for a pizza& wing kinda night or event. The staff I've interacted with are always so friendly! A Must try!"}
{"text":"The wings are good and the pizza is ok. I've been here a few times and never had any problems till tonight. I ordered 12 mild wings and they gave me hot. It's not that big of a deal the only thing I wasn't happy about was the guy at the register. Instead of apologizing he told me you said hot. I never order hot, always order mild. He definitely needs better customer service."}
{"text":"You get value for your money here.  Just don't overdo since this is mostly junk food.  Pizza is good, but the thick crust isn't really a pizza pie variation, literally just more dough, but smaller so it's pretty much aesthetic difference for the same pizza."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've had in awhile. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza, garlic Parmesan boneless wings, antipasto salad and then the zeppoles for dessert.  We all 3 talked about how delicious everything was the whole time we ate it. The pizza had a really awesome crust to it and was really flavorful.   I would really recommend this place for an affordable and tasty meal, will be back forsure!"}
{"text":"This place has best wings. Greek salad, zucchini and pizza  AWESOME! REASONABLE PRICES TOO! I love this place"}
{"text":"This place has good pizza and good wings.  I'm glad to have a place like this close to my house.  This will be my go to for pizza and wings.  Fast and great customer service,  and most importantly it was clean.  Keep up the good work.  Don't let this place go down."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. The wings are freaking amazing. The owner is a really nice guy. When I was waiting for my pizza and wings, I noticed he recognized his customers and knew them. He would joke with them and was very down to earth. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not bad, but overall, not superb.  We opted for a pizza and wings combo as we continue our quest to find the best pizza and wings in the valley.  Great pizza and great wings can be found separately, but so far, finding them in the same place has been more like a hunt for a needle in a haystack.  Or a search for Jimmy Hoffa.  Or a mission to discover life on other planets.    The pizza was the winner.  It was what you'd expect from a local place that isn't some kind of Hut.  Nice flavor, good crust.  The ranch dressing is seriously nice.  Wings were a bit overcooked and dry, and they really needed a good bath in the sauce.  The sauce was well-flavored with a good balance of taste and spice.  Overall, it's not a bad deal for some good pizza and some wings with potential."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise.  I wanted to try a new pizza place close to home and found some great reviews about Rkidds.  The pizza was good,  great crust and flavor.  The wings were hot and extra crispy, just the way I like it.  The best things were the Zeppolini's though! Those little dough balls were good! I would go back just for that.  Friendly service and reasonably priced.  I will be trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Great place for pizza and wings. They are speedy and high quality. Best for takeout and never a long wait."}
{"text":"If we would have had only the wings it would have been higher.  They were crispy and flavorful. The pizza was a little disappointing mainly because it was \"cooked\" in a conveyor type oven, the thin crust really wasn't thin crust. If I wanted all that dough I would have ordered bread. I will give them a nod for using real sausage not the stuff the other guys use, but the pepperoni needs improvement. Finally, the salad was just ok. No real flavor even with the balsamic dressing."}
{"text":"We just tried Rkidds for the first time tonight. We just didn't want Pizza Hut-again!!! We ordered a pep pizza, Supreme Stromboli, Greek salad Boneless wings and an order of  Zeppoles. We thought everything tasted great and we will order again."}
{"text":"If you want flama wings and flama pizza at a flama price come thru to this place. But apparently they make better pizza in Cottonwood but don't believe the lies. Only L takers are there"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza and service in the neighborhood. We get our wings extra crispy with the sauce on the side so they stay amazing on the drive home."}
{"text":"Best BBQ chicken pizza ever. Definitely a must have. Small place with a few tables. Mainly for takeout. Check it out"}
{"text":"R Kidds has some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix! Their wings are pretty amazing too!   Their prices are more than reasonable and the staff members are super nice!   Not too many tables to eat, so it's best to pick up and take home."}
{"text":"This place is great. You can tell its family owned.  And the extra care can be found in the pizza and wings. Make sure to get extra ranch. Idk if they make it in house but yummy. They have good deals to. No delivery  , that sucks. But you for sure have to try it."}
{"text":"Came over here for lunch one day with a coworker and I have to say it's very delicious. The crust makes a pizza for me and this one delivers. Ordered their lunch special 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $3.50, $3.50! That's a incredible deal for a meal. I've also had their suicide sauce on some boneless wings and that was some good sauce! Spicy with a kick, but with overall flavor.   This place is one of my new favorite places for lunch. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place seriously has the best pizza and the best prices! We are vegetarian and the veggie pizza is full of flavor! Our food is always ready in 15 minutes, which is awesome for last minute dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is much more reasonable than the average pizza joint.. spent no more than 24$ on a large pizza and 20 wings.. good deal right! The bread was light and flaky, the wings were good, especially the honey chipotle. Will be coming back here again for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Customer service:  Everyone we had an encounter with was wonderfully kind and funny.   Cleanliness: Eating area was dirty and not making it possible to eat inside which brings up the topic that there is no room to eat inside. A booth and a table in tight quarters.   Pizza: The Pizza has the flavor and taste of natural ingredients. Not an overly abundant amount of meat but the veggies were packed on.   Wings:  Over cooked with no real tender meat left with the flavorings tasting pretty cheap like a syrup."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza and wings. Every time I have to babysit I order R.kidds. They are quick to serve which makes them even better."}
{"text":"i love this place! super friendly staff super good pizza and wongs and reasonable prices. the only negative is that they dont deliver and the seating area is super small, but the food is super good so i always still come back"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza to take home. They have pretty good deals and the pizza and wings were delicious. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly shocked by RKidds. I wanted to try something different and this place was a block up the street and we'll definitely be doing there again.   Delicious pizza and awesome wings for $15 withing walking distance, talk about a dangerous combination for a failing Pizza Eaters Anonymous member.   I highly recommend them over the little Caesars in the opposite plaza"}
{"text":"This place sucks all around the pizza is on the same level of quality as is little Caesars for double the price and if the owner is intimidated by you he'll be rude & unprofessional. Quality/customer service is not a priority here. Next time im going to little caesars its across 35th avenue."}
{"text":"my boyfriend n I loved the Kamata olives on the pizza it was so good, salad was great an amazing price , near our Marriotthotel great food"}
