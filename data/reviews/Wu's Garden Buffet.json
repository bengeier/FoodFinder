{"text":"I don't know how did people give low rating reviews for this place, I felt like seeing a bunch of greedy people not being appropriate.  We came on Tuesday for lunch, the food was adequate for the price at $9.99.  The sushi were even better than the lunch sushi at Dragon pearl but the price is much lower here.  The servers were all working hard and took away the dirty plates quickly, they also gave a whole pot of hot water for free.  I saw one of the lady server helped a senior brought his plate  full of food back to the seat because he forgot where his table was.  Not a fancy place but for the price and the service, good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Wu's Garden Buffet replaced Golden Light Buffet in name only.  A number of management type staff are the same, the place looks the same, fixtures unchanged, and even the plates are the same (they have the Golden Light logo on them).  Lunch buffet is priced at $9.99 on Tuesdays, and $13.99 on other days. The restaurant was perhaps 90% full on the Tuesday I was there.  Despite not being at full capacity, dishes kept running out quickly.  The reason is because the buffet trays are small.  Whether the kitchen was purposely slow in keeping up or was simply overwhelmed, a number of dishes was only seen once and never to be seen again.  You can spin this in a positive way in that you do not have to worry about food sitting out for too long.  Food selection was somewhat basic. For example, they had 6 trays of fruits, but it was 2 each of pineapples, honey dew melons, and grapes. Service was ok.  As long as you call their attention, wait staff will take away dirty plates and refill water glasses. I am giving them 2 stars because it only cost me $9.99 today.  If I had to pay $13.99 for the same lunch, I would rate it a single star."}
{"text":"I usually come here with family but recently it just hasn't been as good. They have good lobster and good Peking duck but that's about it. The lobster isn't all you can eat either. It's one per guest. Not as much variety as before. They also provide discount if it's your birthday! Price isn't great for what you're getting the decor is nice though."}
{"text":"This is probably the utterly worst tasting buffet I ever been to. I only came because I had a $20 off coupon.   When you first walk in the decor and layout of the buffet seems decent. BUT DONT BE FOOLED! The taste to price ratio is wayyyyyy off!!!!  There were like unappetizing dishes in front of me as I walked down the isles. Even the desserts looked off. From the taste of the foods I thought that this is an at most under $20 buffet and since I had the coupon I thought \"whatever it's a free meal anyways\".   However, the bill came and it was 33.32..... How does one charge so much for something so awful tasting???  So with the coupon I paid $16 with tip for this horrible meal on my Sunday night dinner.....  What a waste of stomach room... especially on a Sunday night.....   P.s. The waitress was asking for tip too..... way to ruin a Sunday night....."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed.. some meat dishes tasted a bit off. Lobster was small and hard. The other dishes were mostly just below average. The best thing was the roast beef. Couldn't go wrong with fruit though."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Wu's Garden Buffet and I came on a Tuesday for lunch (its cheaper on Tuesdays!). The place was pretty busy for 1:30PM and there was a small selection of food choices. Lots of similarly typed food like vegetables, noodles, fried foods but nothing in particular stood out.  A lot of the times there was empty or close to empty food items left and I walked around the aisles with a half empty plate.  The saving grace was the tofu dessert but that was devoured within 5 minutes of it being refilled.   During my stay, there was 2 customers who I overheard complaining that there is no food available to eat. I find myself secretly agreeing with them despite the price. If you're looking for a cheap lunch place and dont have particular expectations for what you're eating then this is the place."}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese buffet, has all your regular stuff and food quality is OK.  Choices include crab leg, sushi, peking duck ...."}
{"text":"Food was ok, limited on food compared to... other buffets.  Have seen kids use the ladle for scooping soup to drink... than putting it into a bowl.  Could be better.  Water is free. Tea, and pop is extra charge."}
{"text":"I'm very confused with my rating for this place and I can see why the ratings are a little all over the place. I've been here a few more times since my last visit and the quality of the place is very inconsistent. I also miss the previous management team...I feel like they ran the place much better and they had a lot more customers than they do now.  I'd have to say that this place can be a hit or miss. When I  came on a bad day, I'd honestly give them 1-2 stars. The food wasn't being replenished fast enough or did it taste good...there was barely any food for a buffet. The soup was watered down and the ice cream was melting in the freezer.   On the better days, you'll find more food (lol) and even lobsters with decent amount of meat inside during their Tuesday promo. Lunch time can get hectic especially when there's an event going on 'cause they'll literally run out of plates!   Best of luck when you try out this place, may the odds be in your favour."}
{"text":"Wu's Garden Buffet is the latest buffet to take over this location of revolving buffets.  In fact one of the signs outside still has the old name on it.  We came for a lunch birthday celebration.  There's not a lot of variety but the good thing is the containers are small so the turn over is fresher.  Nothing really stands out but the quality is more on the lower side.  The prices are pretty cheap so that's a plus, but then again you basically pay for what you get.  Service was adequate and polite.  3/5."}
{"text":"I really liked how spacious this place was. It's great for hosting parties.  I came here on a Thursday night and it was a bit quiet but there was also a snow storm going on so I assume I was one of the few people willing to tough out the storm to go to a buffet on a Thursday night.  Well, more food for me.  For dinner, you'll find your regular Chinese veggie and meat dishes, and they also have a Japanese food table which serves sushi and sashimi. There is also a grill section that serves teriyaki and bbq chicken and beef etc. I was so full that I didn't have a chance to have any of the roast beef but mmm it looked delicious.  Apparently there is a $9.99 deal on Tuesday for lunch -- what a steal! You can barely get anything for 10 bucks these days.  I'd recommend coming on a Friday night or weekends, and for the Tuesday lunch special. Apparently these guys get a lot of parties coming from the various Community centres and ice rinks near by so it can get busy!"}
