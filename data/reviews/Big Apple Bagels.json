{"text":"Tried these bagels as part of a bagel club at work and they were awful. My bagel was not cooked all the way and felt like it weighed 3lbs. Not edible, threw it in the trash."}
{"text":"I love big apple bagels! The bagels are always so big and you get so much! They always have a pretty good variety to pick from. My favorite is the big apple club..yum!"}
{"text":"Great bagel sandwiches and pretty fair prices also."}
{"text":"I was craving a salmon bagel a couple of weeks ago, so my hubs stopped here to get me one instead of driving all the way to Bruggers.  Well, not a lot of people order those from the Big Apple in Tega Cay.  The salmon was old and had a mealy texture.  It was a to-go order or I would hv most definitely requested a refund.  Wont be going back for that.  Maybe a plain bagel."}
{"text":"I placed an order online and went to pick it up and the brunette women called me an idiot and said they didn't do online ordering which was kind of shocking because I ordered and payed through grub hub. Absolutely insulting customer service. It is one thing to say you aren't taking online orders but calling someone an idiot is beyond disgraceful."}
{"text":"The bagels, muffins and coffee are exceptional.  The service was friendly and fast!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were here today at 10:25 a.m. There is a handwritten white board sign in the window that says, \"4th of July will be open 7-11\" ?? Looks awful. We were looking for a chocolate chip bagel, but there were none. We were offered an Oreo bagel instead so we decided to give it a try.  Also ordered a plain bagel and 8 mini muffins. The counter help expressed before looking that they might not have enough??  She then said that someone came in that morning and asked for four dozen muffins and they didn't have enough as if a large order was a bad thing. Our order came out and the Oreo bagel looked an odd grey color and smelled like garlic or onion. Two of us tried it and couldn't figure out what it was supposed to taste like. I went back in and asked for a plain bagel instead and received the replacement with no issues. Then, we took out the plain bagels to eat them and they were totally raw. They were still wet and gooey inside. I can't believe whoever sliced them to put cream cheese on them didn't see the goo. There was no color at all to the outside. We tossed both bagels in the trash. Ditch the handwritten sign, or at least correct the grammar. Wipe off slicing knives after slicing bagels with strong tastes/odors and cook the bagels all the way!"}
{"text":"I'm so picky when it comes to bagels. I've never found a great place out here. I came here this morning and I was blown away. The BLT bagel on jalape√±o was wonderful. 

The customer service could be better. The employees were yelling at each other and seemed irritated. But the 5 star is for how good the food was."}
{"text":"The  staff is so awesome and friendly. My favorite is The B Black Velvet coffee and you certainly will not go wrong in choosing any of their muffins."}
{"text":"A little place tucked away in a strip mall, well worth a stop for a great bagel sandwich. Get a toasted bagel, they are the perfect consistency for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Was looking for a different bagel place this morning and found Big Apple Bagels.  I'm glad I went in.  The young staff really knows customer service.  VERY friendly,  outgoing and patient.  Bagels are great.  Fresh,  crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  Just the way a new York bagel should be.  Next time I'm going to try some muffins along with bagels."}
{"text":"Happened upon Big Apple Bagels when eating at Peking Tokyo and decided to try them out this morning for breakfast. YES... a good bagel place in Fort Mill besides the packaged nonsense at Starbucks. 

Friendly staff, well-priced and enjoyable. 

I'd say give this place a look as we were quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Pretty good bagels. I had the bagel and lox sandwich for $9, and it was a little overpriced. The salmon was fairly thick cut and a little sparse (I thought), but good, the tomato was sliced very thin, and even though I ordered onion and chive cream cheese, I got plain. My sesame seed bagel did have a nice texture. 
My husband had a bagel sandwich with an omelet in it, including cheese and a sausage patty. He said his multigrain bagel was pretty good, and the eggs were fine, but it had an American cheese slice and an unremarkable sausage patty. His $0.49 mild roast coffee was pretty weak (I guess for that price you shouldn't expect too much). 
Overall, just average. The counter staff folks, however, were cheerful, helpful, and patient. We'll probably go back sometime to get some bagels to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. I was charged over $5 for a bagel with cream cheese! When I told the cashier I've paid $3 for the same order the last several weeks her response was \"Yeah well whatever\". Then I watched her take $2 from the cash register and put it into a tip jar. I won't be returning or recommending this place any more."}
{"text":"There was a time when a chain bagel shop opening in my town wouldn't have excited me much, but as I've stated in other reviews, there isn't much in the way of restaurants in Sun Prairie. And we didn't have a bagel shop, so I'll take what I can get. 

So with high hopes, I dashed out to Big Apple with my \"store grand opening\" coupon in hand. But much to my dismay, I discovered it was located in a gas station convenience store.

But not just any gas station convenience store, it was sort of an upscale one with an America/highway theme. In addition to bagels, it had a little grocery and liquor store. Very weird. Anyway, being in a gas station, this Big Apple Xpress had a very limited menu. They had some tables, but who wants to eat at a convenience store?"}
{"text":"My little guy and I stopped in for a quick lunch. I had a bagel sandwich with turkey and cheese.  It was quite tasty, veggies were fresh and it was filling. We also ordered a muffin which was good.  I would certainly eat this meal again.  

 The branding is sort of annoying - it's like three places in one -  bagel shop, muffin shop and the coffee has a brand also. I don't know why this annoys me, but it does.  It just makes the place feel a little disjointed."}
{"text":"Got exactly what I expected. Fast delivery. Just needs a little more consistency, I ordered for delivery once and there was no minimum, the next week I ordered there was. No big deal however, I would have had my order together had I known."}
{"text":"I finally stopped by yesterday and grabbed a dozen bagels and two cream cheese spreads.  The aroma when you walk inside was mouth warm watering!  Let me tell you the assortment of bagels had the same effect.  Everyone loved them and it was a huge hit!  Great service- great food!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here the other day and have gotten togo bagels on a couple occasions.  The bagels here are very good and they have a variety of cream cheese flavors.

On this most recent visit I got a breakfast bagel sandwich.  It was good, but it was microwave bacon.  It would have really been something special if it was fresh, but I understand that isn't their specialty. 

I would recommend giving this place a try.  You will need to get there early though.  They can run out of certain bagels and won't replace or refill during the day."}
{"text":"First time to come in here and ordered a breakfast BLT the Honey Wheat bagel with cinnamon apple very tasty very nice people working here I will return ."}
{"text":"Big apple bagels was a pleasant surprise. I stumbled upon the place by accident when I was lost around the area and thought what the heck, let's try something new. I mean how good could a bagel place be? Well I really enjoyed it. They have wide variety of bagels and other goodies. They also have a nice variety of coffee which is nice. 

I got their turkey and bagel and I also bought the cherry cheesecake muffin. I have to admit, it was the best cherry cheesecake muffin I've had. The turkey bagel sandwich was wonderful as well. The prices are decent (I think $6-7 for the bagel with turkey etc). 

The staff is very friendly as well. The place is also connected to another place to eat next door so it's nice to have variety. It is also located right next to a 24 hour fitness so you can eat your bagel and then work off all the calories lol. Anyways I recommend trying this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm curious how this place even has 3 stars???  

We did not read the reviews before going here, just happened to see it and wanted to try it out.  We walked in and the smell was oh so wonderful, I thought we were going to have something fabulous.  

As we were browsing the menu, I spotted a cookies n cream bagel - I've never seen that flavor and thought, heck yes let's try that!  Kevin ordered one of the sandwiches which had egg, ham, and American cheese.  My bagel had zero, I mean ZERO, flavor.  Wait, I take that back, it tasted like flour!!!  I would expect for this to be a sweet bagel with hints of chocolate cookie, but they were not there.  Kevin's bagel had very little flavor as well, but what to you expect with microwaved ingredients and American cheese as the choice of cheese? 

The girls behind the counter were patient, nice, and helpful, but that does not get a business anywhere when the food is just plain out awful.

I will never return and you should save your money to go somewhere else.  Heck Wal-Mart's bakery behind the store probably offers better bagels!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy for my tummy. Finally found a great bagel shop. It has been hard to find a good bagel here in Vegas, until now. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this morning, got a dozen assorted bagels and 2 tubs of cream cheese to go. I'm more than impressed, these are some of the freshest, softest, best tasting bagels I've ever had, and their cream cheeses (we got a cheddar/bacon & a jalape√±o) are fantastic! We'll definitely be back!

BTW, the name of the place is Big Apple Bagels, not sure how the name was added incorrectly here as Bagels Las Vegas, and neither are the employees. Whatever it's called, it's a win!"}
{"text":"The best muffins in the Nevada!!!!! If you haven't had one do yourself a favor and go get one now!"}
{"text":"First time here as we don't live nearby. I am blown away! My husband, Kids and myself all enjoyed it. We ate a breakfast sandwich, cinnamon crumb muffin, cheddar bagel with cream cheese, 3 different mini muffins and a coffee (which was tastily strong!). Customer service was great, they walk your food up to you tableside or to your hand which was incredibly nice and unexpected. They offer flavor creamers and when I went back to the counter to order a dozen bagels to take home they baked them fresh for me right then!! 
Awesome. Blows away any other bagel spot in town by far."}
{"text":"Came here today on my lunch break. The atmosphere is calm and inviting and the whole place smells like pastries! The woman behind the counter was a serious sweetheart and had a great smile.

I ordered the bagel and lox because I was craving it, and it was awesome. A little steep at 8 bucks but lox are expensive anyway. It had a tomato slice in it which surprised me but was a pleasant addition. The whole menu looks amazing and I really can't wait to try more. 

The bagels themselves are a little bit less than my standard (I am a bagel snob) but this didnt take away from my great experience or my satisfied stomach. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went there for Sunday brunch, the manager was really kind and offered us a sample of coffee. We got a holy guacamole and southern tradition & both were well made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible but the bagels tasted like rAw dough. They're selection isn't the greatest either. Good for a quick breakfast but I'd check out other options before going there."}
{"text":"Went back for a second trip to re confirm the greatness of this place.  The owner greeted us with complementary fresh out of the oven bread pudding muffin cakes.  We couldn't believe the flavors and goodness of this muffin.  We went on to order an assortment of breakfast bagels that were all fresh and delightful. My favorite had Egg, Cheese, Avocado, hot spicy sauce and bacon.  I think it was called The Ranchero.  This is not your typical Bagel spot, It is just so much more!  It's worth the short 10 minute ride from Downtown Vegas"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Vegas. I can't find better bagels anywhere. I live so far away. I can't come here often. It's a 25 minute drive for me. I love good bagels is a treat to me. They have perfect texture and flavor.
Plus they have interesting muffins. I'll be trying those next."}
{"text":"BIG APPLE BAGELS  vs. EINSTEIN    I  went into the pretty well reviewed bagel company .     I'm originally from New York  so bagels are a big part of my food group .  Einstein bagels is pretty close but Big Apple bagels? ........
 Let's just say , I doubt if I'm going back .     First,  they were clueless  on alot of there products, which was the least of it . And secondly,   it was more expensive than Einstein.  Let's talk about taste...  Even though the bagel dough was light and fluffy  the flavor just wasn't there.    Einstein bagels I can say doesn't have the best customer service however the New York flavor is there.   I just take mine to go .    I was hoping for the name Big Apple bagels  to match the establishment but it's just not happening .  It's okay if it's your first time ,  your not wasting your money .   It would be a mistake if I went back a second time."}
{"text":"We have been a few times now. The bagels are pretty good as are the sandwiches. The folks working are always very nice, not always the quickest but never too bad of a wait."}
{"text":"Yelped Bagels today and found Big Apple. Brought them home for the family and they loved them. The cream cheeses were awesome. Real apple chunks and real green onion.

Then I surprised them with a dozen of the minis and they were great ."}
{"text":"Yummy !! Cute little place for a quick breakfast spot .. the bagels are fresh and delicious and the different combos are really good .. i recommend this spot for a quick bagel sandwich if you're on the go !!"}
{"text":"Ran into the place by mistake... Great customer service - the bagels and the pastries are delicious.... the owners where very friendly .. and told us about the half off special  The lemon key pie is to die for thanks for the great customer service and letting us try a few pasteries can't wait to try the breakfast bagels"}
{"text":"I tried three different kinds of bagels from this store. Swiss Melt, Asiago Melt and Cinnamon. All three were very good, my husband and I fought over the cinnamon ones. (The cheese bagels were excellent for making sandwiches.)

The price structure is a little weird, you have to pay attention or you might end up paying more than you expected as some bagels are considered 'premium' and so have an added charge. 

And yes, it is in a BP gas station, but a very clean gas station that also has hand-dipped ice cream."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 3 because I absolutely love their bagels but I gotta tell you the girl working today with the tattoos all over her was so dang RUDE!  She literally tossed my bagels to my on the table and didn't say a word. Other patrons saw it and we all looked at each other with puzzled looks. Maybe shes having a bad day or hates her job!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago. Good food at good prices. I only wish it was a bit more cozy of an atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has good reviews, but we really don't know why.  This is the worst bagel we've ever eaten. I'd buy Sarah Lee any day over this. Noah's is elevated to the level of Essa bagel in NYC compared to this place. 

blueberry : Dry and tasteless 
Cinnamon Raisin : Dry hard and tasteless
Rancher breakfast bagel on an Everything bagel : Avo was sour, there was no taste of \"everything\" and the cheddar was bad cheese. 

Lastly the cashier acted like it was our fault she had to get out of bed today. Miserable customer service is generous."}
{"text":"As far as bagels go, you'll never have a shortage of places to choose from here in Vegas but f you're looking for a well made bagel that comes close to New York then this is the place.

No frills bagel shop but quality none the less. They share a space with another fast food spot so it's kind of weird walking in. It's conveniently located inside a shopping center so parking is ample.

Came in on a weekday mid morning and were greeted by a friendly and polite staff. The selection was plentiful and everything looked super fresh. 

Went with a jalape√±o cheese bagel woth their chive cream cheese. Asked for it toasted and didn't have to wait long. I believe the gentleman who served us was the owner.

Loved it so much we got a second one. Bagels are soft and chewy on the inside with that slightly hard crust on the outside. The cream cheese was flavorful and fresh as well."}
{"text":"Being from New Jersey, I'm desperate for three things in the South.  Pizza, Hard Rolls, and Bagels.    I solved the first by making my own pizza, gave up on hard rolls, but I'm still searching for bagels.

I was excited to see a bagel shop open in Fort Mill.    Unfortunately the bagels here aren't up to my expectations.  A good bagel should be chewy, with a nice, golden brown exterior.

The bagels don't seem to have been boiled prior to baking, and they are pale.  I don't think they're baking them enough.

I really, REALLY wanted to like this place but can't justify going back."}
{"text":"Amazing - We love BAB and are SO excited that it is back in Henderson.  We are NY'ers who are always on the search for great bagels and this is the place for us! Great service - Great ! Great ! Great ! Bagels !!!! Also the muffins and coffee are delicious too!"}
{"text":"The staff is rude and not very welcoming the bagels are ok coffee was good . I think other places are better"}
{"text":"Went in the morning around 10, the selection had somewhat dwindled but still had a decent amount of bagels. Ended up getting the Southwest Breakfast sandwich. It was pretty solid. The bagel was good, a little sweet for a plain bagel but good. Overall a quality breakfast sandwich st a super affordable price. I'll definitely head back there and try their other options as well as the muffins."}
{"text":"Really tasty bagels. Only reason not 5 stars is I wish they had a little more variety in the types of bagels they make."}
{"text":"Allright bagels. Hard to get them fast and hot when busy"}
{"text":"I really love coming here versus going to Einstein's. You can really taste that their bagels are using very fresh ingredients. The pricing is standard & overall, I love coming here! My favorite thing to order is a start fresh selection on a jalape√±o cheddar bagel!!! Yummy! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've held off on going here for awhile because of the so-so reviews. But this morning, I just reeeeaaally wanted a bagel and didn't want to go far, so I gave Big Apple a shot. I felt it was on par with the reviews. Just.... eh. I got lox on an everything bagel. The bagel was sparsely seasoned and bland. I asked that it be toasted and if they toasted it at all, it was just barely. It almost had an underbaked texture to it. It was served up sandwich style and sliced in half rather than open faced - not a big deal, just a style difference. Not sure that I'll be back. I can go to the Harris Teeter on the corner and put together a better spread at home."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place! My boys love their fresh made bagels and I LOVE the staff. Ajay is the the biggest sweetheart and caters to your every need! I would give them more than 5 stars if I could!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and bagels were fresh and delicious. Coffee was perfect not like that commercial coffee all the sheep and trendy people drink (Starbucks)... But that's my taste buds. And I like supporting locally owned businesses. Muffins are great too.  Monday's the muffins are like 40% cheaper. And all products in the display case are 50% off one hour before it closes."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up some bagels for work meeting . Large selection of bagels and some muffins we're on display . Seemed like a popular morning spot for hendersonites. The everything bagel was really good and covered completely in everything . Jalapeno cream cheese was really good too. The other 8 bagels went over really well as well. Overall great service and quality bagels ."}
{"text":"Yuck these bagels are not ny bagels just bread!!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a New York bagel and what I got was something slightly better than Smiths supermarket. The service was good but if they were trying to be close to what a New York bagel truly is they've kind of failed."}
{"text":"Big Apple Bagels used to be located on McCoy Rd in that little shopping center by Blockbuster.  Then they went out of business.  The sign on their door at the time said \"closed due to tough economic times.\"  

About a year later they re-emerged inside their present location, a fancy pance gas station.  Just so everyone knows, before that fancy gas station was built on that piece of property, there used to be a big, beautiful farm house there.  It appeared to be built in the early 19th century and was surrounded by 100 year old oak trees.  I find that tidbit of information depressing every time I look at this new gas station, who by the way, has the highest gas prices in town.

Relating specifically to the service, the employees are hit and miss.  The employees for the gas station and the bagel shop are interchangeable.  I've seen both groups covering both businesses.  There is one employee in particular who is my prickly little peach.  She wears 40 tons of black eye liner, a black choker, and a frown every day.  I'm pretty sure she's bipolar.  One day she's friendly, the next she is pelting you with insults that come flying out of her mouth at the speed of light and leave you with a million little paper cuts.    

Their sandwiches are expensive, and very underwhelming.  I can do better at home.  Plus, they all act like they are being incredibly inconvenienced when you ask for a sandwich to be made.  

Extra tip here:  Have a general idea what you want, because you will get the super heavy eye rolls and flying insults, (if prickly peach is working) when you appear to be undecided in any way.

And please, please don't have any questions!!!    

I've tried all the flavors of bagels, and cheddar is obviously the best, that's why I hoard them.  Someone call that show on A&E!!!!  

They also have muffins, but they are just ok and again expensive.

My advice is to run in there with your coat on, have a good idea what you want ahead of time, be clear when you order, pay for them, and hurry out.         

In closing I will tell you a secret!!  

If you go after 5pm the bagels are half priced!  Shhhhh!!"}
{"text":"I was leaving CVS on Wigwam when I noticed the word Bagels on the strip mall sign. Being a bagel obsessed person, I drove around until I was in front of Big Apple Bagel Express. As it was around 4:30 pm, the store was closed, but there was always tomorrow. I looked them up on the Internet, and found out that they make breakfast and lunch sandwiches, as well as several different types of muffins. The next morning, I got to the store around 8am. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful smell!
The store was bright and very clean. There was a glass display case to the right of the register that was stocked with many different types of bagels, as well as 8 favors of muffins. Each muffin was offered in a bite sized mini muffin, and a jumbo muffin (very large). I was greeted by two very pleasant guys, I'd guess the owners. I purchased 6 bagels, 2 plain, 2 poppy, and 2 sesame. I also bought one each of the mini muffins (8) to taste test. I was told they were sold in 3's, so I added a second pumpkin spice. I got home and toasted up a poppy, added a little butter and some cream cheese. The bagel was crisp on the outside, dense and chewy on the inside. It was easily the best bagel I've had since leaving NY 8 years ago. I couldn't tell if the bagels were steam and bake, or boil and bake, but they were really good. The mini muffins were fabulous! I have hit the jackpot 1 mile from my house. I intend on going back to try a breakfast and/or lunch sandwich very soon. Highly recommended!

My only advice to the owners would be to bite the bullet and replace the generic \"Bagel\" sign with a custom sign on the strip mall directory sign on Wigwam. People would then have a better first impression of the business and its excellence."}
{"text":"Bagels are small compared to other deli shops. Kinda over priced too. Parking is always full since the gym is right next door"}
{"text":"After the gym and dance lesson I was very glad to find a healthy restaurant to eat dinner out. After being busy all day, cooking is out of the question tonight. Last time I visited the dance studio this cafe was closed but today got out early enough to try. It is all good too. The first thing that I noticed about this restaurant is the music. It is that easy music that I grew up with the the late 80s and 90s. They have been playing such tracks as Culture Club, Journey, and Starship. The display case that showcases all the bagels is very large with more than a dozen bagel choices. They have exotic flavors as well such as bacon cheddar. Which by the way is wonderful roasted with strawberry cream cheese.

The service was stellar and the cashier was very friendly. He took my order and made it to. While I was waiting for the food, which did not take that long he even brought it to the table. Besides the bacon bagel I tried the Start Fresh breakfast sandwich. This sandwich had egg whites, provolone, and turkey sausage. It was so good perfectly balanced and cooked. It is very heart health my too. I had the breakfast toasted on a Cinnamon Sugar bagel. I love that even at 4:30 pm that a guest can get eggs cooked at a small cafe and it be delicious and healthy. For dessert I had to have a small cherry cheesecake pastry. It was so wonderful, very cherry! With the check in from yelp which I redeemed you receive 10 percent off the order. That is priceless!"}
{"text":"This is a great bagel shop. Very friendly and the bagels are the freshest I've had.  It is frequented by locals who have many other options in this growing area. Serve yourself from many fresh coffee choices. You'll love Big Apple Bagels. Parking is convenient too."}
{"text":"We came here after a debacle at another breakfast place nearby. Bagels sounded great at this point. We are so happy that we came here. We had a Swiss Melt bagel and garden veggie cream cheese. 

This was one of the best bagels that I have ever had. It was light and crispy with a lot of flavor. It was a very different concept having two restaurants in the same location, but it works just fine. The employees were very efficient. I really liked this place."}
{"text":"At some point I shared with my boyfriend that I was obsessed with the strawberry bagels at Big Apple as a kid, and when he spotted the sign for their Sun Prairie shop on his way to work one day he was sure to share the find with me. That next Sunday morning we hopped in the car and made the trek to the northeast side of Sun Prairie. 

Things that were a bit disappointing upon arrival: it's actually an \"Xpress\" location inside a gas station (aka only a couple of small tables among the shelves), and there were no strawberry bagels on display. 

Since we drove all the way out there we decided to still grab breakfast sandwiches to go. I opted for the breakfast BLT - bacon, lettuce, and tomato on your choice of bagel with your choice of cream cheese. In my case, that was on plain with onion and chive spread. The bacon is of the microwaved variety you can find in the grocery store, but the veggies were fresh enough. 

The bagel was as I remember - soft and chewy and to me better than Einstein's/Bruegger's. At $4 including tax I felt like the sandwich was a decent deal. It isn't, however, worth the drive from downtown Madison, especially when I have a local bagel spot a couple of blocks away. 

I don't know if BAB still makes their strawberry variety; it's been probably twenty years or so since my last visit so it just might not be an item on their menu anymore. Perhaps their full stores have a wider selection. 

If I lived nearby this would probably make it into my rotation on mornings I wanted something more than cereal but didn't want to sit down somewhere. For the quality and distance from my home, though, I'll just pick up the fixings from the grocery store and stop by my neighborhood bagel shop if I'm in the mood for a cream-cheesy bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"Bagels are cooked properly but definitely not super fresh. Staff is VERY  young and lacking in customer service (still wet behind the ears-types) but they are fast. You get a good deal and their prices on simple bagels with cream cheese are cheap. They also have a rewards program that gives free drinks, etc. For a chain, this place isn't bad. I will return but not that often."}
{"text":"I just searched for brunch on Yelp and this was one of two places that popped up. 
I should have looked closer but just hit the directions button and was surprised to find myself at a gas station, starved for a vista. 
$3.15 for a bagel with cream cheese.  It was ok. I asked for it toasted & It did have what looked like toaster marks; but it was cold when I got it; I was the only one there. 
If I was in the area, I might pop in again, but I probably won't make the 4 minute drive from the Main Street area where I tend to eat when in Sun Prairie again. 

Someone else said there used to be oak trees in this area. Shame they couldn't have left a few standing; it's pretty nothing to see out here."}
{"text":"Yum! This is a nice addition to the area.

I found out about this place through coupons they sent out to homes in the area. I didn't end up using the bagel with cream cheese freebie since I wanted something different, but I did take them up on the free coffee coupon. 

This is in the shopping center at the corner of Wigwam and Pecos in the same section as Teriyaki Madness. In fact, the inside of the shop is shared with Teriyaki Madness. The parking lot is a breeze and has plenty of parking.

I had the Jalapeno Cheddar bagel with Tuna Salad. I absolutely loved the bagel and wish I had just had cream cheese on top to enjoy the flavor of the bagel more. There was plenty of tuna salad on the bagel without making it difficult to eat. My husband had the Holy Guacamole on Jalapeno Cheddar bagel. He also really enjoyed his meal. I liked that there were about 15 different bagel flavor options including several with cheese (yum). They even offer a Swiss bagel which I've never seen before.

We also enjoyed four mini muffins. My favorites were the Cinnamon and Loaded Apple Pie.  My Brewster's coffee was also really good and they offered at least half a dozen flavors. 

The service was very good. The guy that took our order was friendly, helpful, and checked in after we ate to make sure we enjoyed everything. I can't help but love places a little more when I can see that a business takes provide in good food and good service.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Okay okay okay... thank you YELPLV instagram for letting me know it's National Bagel Day and even more for letting me know that there's a place called Big Apple Bagels a couple of miles from my work! Now I don't have to resort to Einstein :)

This place is open from 6am to 3pm-- I arrived at 9am so it seems like the pick of the litter had been taken. I was able to order my usual bagel order-- Everything with Cream Cheese. Being a slight bagel snob, this place did not dissapoint. Their everything bagel is so flavorful and crunchy on the crust with softness in the middle (when toasted). You can taste the garlic, onion, and sesame seeds... so good!

I also got an oreo muffin and a salted caramel iced coffee (which was great and tasted more like a toasted caramel). I'm excited to come back and use their YELP $7 for $10 deal to bring a dozen to work. Check in and you get 10% off.. give them your phone number and you get a free coffee next time you visit. 

MMMMM!"}
{"text":"The bagels here r good but if u don't get in early u will be lucky if anything is left y they stay open so late is beyond me if there r only a few bagels left by 8 AM then what's there at 5 PM

Make sure u skip Saturdays unless u want someone obnoxious at the register she can't keep any orders straight an she is extremely rude. 

I predict this place will go under."}
{"text":"I'm pretty neutral about this place. The first time I stopped by I had the garlic bagel with jalape√±o cream cheese. The coffee here was pretty good and I really enjoyed the cream cheese. The bagel, however, seemed a little over-toasted, edging on burning the garlic.

My second visit, I had a coupon for a free coffee which was awesome. This time I tried the blueberry bagel with apple cinnamon cream cheese. Again, the cream cheese was very nice. I appreciated that it was fruity without being overly sweet. My bagel again seemed over-toasted and I noticed the cinnamon sugar bagels looked a little well done.

Normally, I really like my bagels toasted, but I think if I come back here, I won't next time. The prices are fair and the staff is pleasant, but so far nothing to write home about."}

    I am a New York transplant that searches for restaurants that put me in a New York state of mind. It's funny that right before my very eyes I had been passing a shopping center with a bagel shop attached to a Teriyaki Madness. It just so happened that I needed to stop at the Pecos at Wigwam CVS when a Big Apple Bagels Express sign caught my attention. Instantaneously it became a mental bookmark and a few mornings later an experience that led to a second one. 

   Big Apple Bagels is a franchise with the motto that \"something big is always baking.\" That something big that they'd be baking was my BLT on a poppy seed bagel. The breakfast BLT with my choice of cream cheese (or spread) was $3.99. With the bagel sandwich, I sipped from a cup of Brewsters coffee. Currently they have a promotion where Brewsters coffee is approximately 50 cents. Before going forward I will discuss the BLT

The BLT:

 I am a fan of the BLT which is bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. The BLT really is one of my all time favorite breakfast sandwiches. At Big Apple, they added a couple of touches to the BLT experience. First the superfluous of jalape√±o cream cheese altered the taste of the sandwich. Speaking of cream cheese, when you order a bagel with cream cheese the price increases from $1.29 to $2.59. In my opinion it pays to spend a $1 or less more on breakfast sandwiches. Back to the additional touches that Big Apple added to the BLT experience, secondly the delicious poppy seed bagel gave the sandwich a knockout taste. 
Verdict: BLT on poppy seed bagel: 4 stars

Northern Omelet:

    Things were going to get better on my second visit. I had joined the Big Apple Bagel club which bestowed me with a complimentary cup of Brewsters coffee. On my second visit, I'd go for a different breakfast sandwich. Decisions! Decisions! That brings up another point; the people working here are patient and friendly. The employee who cooks the sandwiches saw that the person doing the ordering had a customer in front and took the initiative to ask what I wanted to expedite the process. I decided on the Northern Omelet. One more time, a poppy seed bagel delivered me to a New York state of mind. Between the two slices of poppy seed bagel, I tasted sausage, scrambled eggs, American cheese, a tomato, and green pepper. 
   Verdict: 3.5 stars

 Brewsters Coffee:

      This is just a matter of opinion, and in my personal opinion I am not a fan of Brewsters coffee. I am not saying it is bad quality, or discouraging people from drinking it. In my taste it was a taste that I did not care for. 
Verdict: N/A.  Personal taste. 

  The strong points of Big Apple Bagels is that they serve a good bagel sandwich and provide exemplary customer service. My constructive criticism point is that they need to include a side dish with their value meals. Growing up then spending my young adulthood in New York, the typical bagel shop experience included a side of either potato salad or macaroni salad, plus a pickle. In my mind, a bagel minus a side is like eating a hamburger minus fries. Big Apple is not isolated in this. I have addressed this in an Einstein Brothers Bagels review. However, Bagel Cafe near Summerlin includes macaroni or potato salad with their bagel sandwiches. If Big Apple offered macaroni salad or potato salad, I'd probably be the Duke. But I'd be a Duke ordering the bagel to go because the taste of Brewsters coffee doesn't agree with my taste buds.

   In conclusion, I am glad that when I walked out of CVS I saw a bagel shop. Hopefully there is a New York style Kosher Deli or pizza place that I have been passing almost everyday. Maybe I'll stop by a CVS or Walgreens and take a walk around that shopping center. At any rate, Big Apple Bagel is a Good bagel shop and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Had bagels there today and would not recommend it. Two employees just stood around but did not realize that coffee was empty. The egg sandwiches are heated in the microwave and taste substandard. I actually got sick a while after I ate there."}
{"text":"Yummy bagels!!! Loved the water bagel with cream cheese. Also got a turkey bagel, but they only put mayo on one side my bf said the same about his chicken sandwich. The muffins are pretty delicious as well."}
{"text":"Bagels taste really good, and their selection of cream cheese toppings are excellent but softer than I'm used too, they need to cook it a little longer.  I'm a very big fan of BLT bagels .... so I purchased their BLT bagel, was disappointed that they slap two or three little small strips of shrivelled pieces of what appears to be pre-cooked bacon on the bagel, I could taste everything on the bagel (the lettuce, tomatoe, cream cheese, and the bagel - EXCEPT for the bacon.  The bagels have a great flavor, sandwich just appears to be a little skimpy for the price.  Decided to just purchase bagels from them from time to time, and make my own BLT's. Being I'm from NYC - these bagels are an OK substitute, but are in no way a REAL comparison to a true NYC style bagel."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick breakfast with my boyfriend. I got the huevos rancheros breakfast sandwich. It was pretty good. I got it on the everything bagel, I actually think it would have tasted better on a plain bagel. My boyfriend ordered the southern tradition breakfast sandwich with sausage. He said he liked his. For the 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 cups of coffee, it was $10. Not bad. You would spend that much at a fast food place. I will probably start coming here more often now that I've tried it."}
{"text":"Best bagel I have found in all of Las Vegas. The place is very clean and the service was very friendly. I am going to have to try the muffins next time I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"The best bagels in Las Vegas!!! The better cheddar bagels are FABULOUS!! I absolutely love love love this place! Prices are reasonable. Bagels are made fresh. They also these tiny little muffins that are delicious. So glad I found this place"}
{"text":"Basic , too basic. Sad looking breakfast sandwich. Bagel was ok, but the sandwich unfortunately looks like it was made by a child."}
{"text":"Can't beat .49 cent coffee! Coffee tasted good for the price as well. Got the Cookies and cream muffin, it was really good. Staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. I ordered two bagels and they were insanely dry and the muffins were overly sweet! I'll give a big thank you to the same though! They were very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Big Apple Bagels???  The sign on the bags and door say Big Apple Bagel but on yelp it's listed under Bagels Las Vegas.  Whatever the name is is pretty darn good.  The bagels are crispy on the outside and soft and chewy inside.  Customer service is friendly.  Unfortunately they got my ordered mixed up with someone else's and I took the wrong bag home.  Went back and they made me fresh sandwiches.   They also make mini muffins and regular size muffins.   But, I will definitely be back for the bagel sandwiches"}
{"text":"I like this place way better than Einstein! The bagels are very good and they are half price after 2pm daily. As far as I can tell the eggs aren't made fresh to order, so for that reason I like Brooklyn bagel better. They also have muffins and other pastries, and usually have a sample out to taste. Service is good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Recent poster says this place is closed. Can't confirm but hell it needs to be closed. 
Horribly uncooked bagels. Went a few times and always the same. You can taste the uncooked flour and so little in choices. I'll confirm if it's out of business asap.


Yes, Closed.  Thank God.  They had no clue."}
{"text":"Being from New York, I'm always on the hunt for a good bagel. My son and I decided to try Big Apple Bagels today for breakfast. It's a very small place with limited seating. One woman was very upset because she'd been waiting 20 minutes for her bagel sandwich. It looked like the staff didn't know what they were doing. 

Now on to the bagels and sandwiches. I was dismayed to see them microwaving the eggs. Pretty unappetizing to me. I had an onion bagel with cream cheese. The onions on top were burnt. My son had eggs, bacon and cheese on a plain bagel. He said it was barely edible. One bagel sandwich, one bagel with cream cheese and two muffins was $13.00. Not worth the money. On top of that, they only had coffee mate creamers for the coffee. Ick. 

Bathroom was unclean. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good.  You come in for breakfast and if your mood changes step to the next counter and order Teriyaki Madness...."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh 
I can't say all the great things about this bagel shop 
The bagels are amazing
There muffins are to die for 
And most of all the stay is so friendly 
They work so hard and dedicated to making each customer happy 

Make a trip to try them out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The only place I go on my lunch break because their muffins are amazing and Sawyer is a culinary genius."}
{"text":"I used to live on Long Island, so I know a little bit about bagels. This was good, but it wasn't a classic Brooklyn bagel. Maybe it's the water here in the Charlotte area? It was still a good bagel, toasted with some scallion cream cheese.

The coffee was good too.

Nice that they have a free wifi. Comfortable seating area, maybe a nice place to chill with a laptop for a bit.

My only complaint is that when the gal asked me for the combo, it looked like it's supposed to come with a couple of mini-muffins. No biggie - I don't need that many more carbs!"}
{"text":"We live in Baxter and normally drive to Audrey Kell to get our Sunday bagels.  We were happy to see that Big Apple opened close to us.  My husband ordered take out - an everything bagel for me and a salt bagel for him.  Got home and mine was very doughy and undercooked. I could let that slide; maybe there's someone new in the kitchen. His?  They used TABLE SALT! His entire bagel was encrusted with TABLE SALT. Have the owners ever eaten a bagel besides the dough sent to them to start their franchise?  Both went into the garbage and we won't be back. I'll stick to the mom and pop real bagel places in S Charlotte."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon BAB's when I was looking for coffee when I first got to Avondale and I go back a few times a week.  

Friendly people, great bagels and awesome bagel sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot for breakfast whenever we are making the early trip out to California.  The place is located in a run of the mill strip mall out in Avondale, and it is pretty easy to get to from the freeway.

The bagel selection here is pretty good, rivaling that of the other well known bagel places.  My favorite bagel here is the honey oat.  The nice thing I have noticed is they make the bagels in small batches so you are guaranteed the freshest bagel.  The breakfast sandwiches are pretty good and extremely filling.  The cream cheese selection is also pretty decent, but don't expect any of those light and fluffy types.

If you are out and about in this part of town and feel like a bagel, you should give this place a try.  The staff is always nice and friendly and you never have to wait too long."}
