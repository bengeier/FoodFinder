{"text":"Food is a 3 Star...  Facility Cleanliness is 4.5 Stars.  Service is a 2.5 Stars.  The staff seems to have their eyes grown on top of their head.  Never bother to check if food is any good or refill water and remove empty dishes.  Major negative for this place."}
{"text":"Food is authentic. Small place but worth the wait. The portions are small. Waiters are good at what they do."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place and will try out their home stores in CA when we visit later this summer.  A clean and bright restaurant with ample parking.  We tried out the usual recommendations and they are all good.  Seating could be a challenge on weekends but the staffs are friendly and quick.  We also ordered Take Out on one occasion because, also my one complaint, they don't have a liquor license yet."}
{"text":"Service was on point for an Asian restaurant.. Water was filled immediately when emptied and I dropped my chopsticks and was replaced with new ones within seconds. Owner is from Shanghai and graduated in Hong Kong. She came by and had a small chat then she handed out her business cards and it turns out that she had a few locations in California. Very nice lady. 

We ordered Shanghai beef briskets noodles soup, chive steam dumplings and XLB (???) . All the flavors were good, but the noodles in my soup  was a bit on the softer side. I like mine a bit bouncier. Will be  back to try other goodies !"}
{"text":"Came here to get some dumplings after driving into Vegas. Was greeted with a strange tingling feeling in my mouth after eating some of the dumplings. Not recommended if you are looking for a quick snack."}
{"text":"Food was good. 
Environment: nice, open area, pleasant
Prices:$$$ more on the expensive side especially for chinatown for ok food
Service: people are very nice and helpful in trying to help you make a decision 

Order: dry noodle beef: less traditional than what I am used too and heavy sauce 

Xlb: peanut taste is different than what I am used to but good. 

Would I come back? Maybe but there are other spots here that I prefer

Try it out they have an extensive menu and exploring is half the fun!"}
{"text":"I know Ding's Garden well as I lived in S. California for many years and have eaten their food many times. 

This is their first venture to the Vegas area.

This restaurant is in a large strip mall with ample parking. The place is easy to spot.
The decor gives you a clean impression -- metallic tables help. Servers try hard, but they still have to learn a lot about the menus and their specific job functions, e.g.:
1. Ordered Braised Duck Shanghai Style -- wait staff brought us Salted Duck. When we rejected the Salted Duck, the wait staff insisted that it is the Braised Duck.( Braised duck is with a red color glaze, salted duck is plain ). Finally, it was resolved. But the wait staff should be able to distinguish the difference right away.
2. Inaccurate ordering -- we ordered a Rice cake Shanghai style and a Spicy Wonton. When the order receipt was brought to our table, it shows two orders of rice cake but no wonton. Although it was resolved easily, it really should not have happened.

The wait staff errors can be improved but some guidance and teaching will be necessary.

Since their opening, I have been to this restaurant four times. There are some dishes that are wonderful, just like what my mother used to cook -- the Shanghainese way. Unfortunately, there are dishes that were not as good:

Braised Beef Tendon - Excellent, the best in Vegas.
Gluten Puff Shanghainese style - ordered three times, all great.
Marinated Cucumbers -- twice were good, third time was tasteless. 
Xiao Long Bao, Onion Pancakes, -- always good.
Spicy Wonton -delicious in taste but the wonton skin is too thick. Try pan fried Wonton instead.
Pan fried Wonton -- great. 
Halogen Spiced peanuts - twice were very good, third time was dry and tasteless.
Fried Stinky Tofu - stinky alright. Do not order this unless you are used to the taste.
Grandmother Drunken Fish - again, not to be ordered unless you are used to the taste.
Braised Duck Shanghai Style; Salted Duck - both are too greasy. Taste is ok. But not appetizing due to the fat.
Salted Chicken SHanghai style - I will avoid that. Not my favorite. 
Beef noodle soup and other rice and noodle dishes are all decent. 

Service and consistency of food quality is an issue. They are experiencing some growing pains. I sincerely hope that all the issues can be rectified.

A 4 star rating is about right for me."}
{"text":"So I found this little place on my way to work and saw the \"Grand Opening\" sign and naturally I had to try it. 

I walk in and immediately like the look. There's about 15 tables (vary in size) that have that steel look to it with two flat screen tvs displaying the different dishes behind the cash register. A more modern clean look. 

The menu has a TON of items, average price is about $10 and the servings are rather healthy size. I ordered the Beef Brown Sauce Dry Noodle (N5). I was impressed by the portion size of the beef and how tender it was, served with the large bowl of noodle. Good thick chunks and the onion was very fresh! It's hard to screw up noodles and thankfully they didn't! I think I'll be coming back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with place. The location being where it is I did not expect this place to be so nicely and modernly decorated. Very clean and quite spacious, lots of lights and tables and chairs were clean, does not look like a typical Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. 

We got the cold plate which was really good, nice portion, a little spicy and was a good start to the meal. My sister wanted to try the stinky tofu...it smelled bad but not terrible. Came with chili sauce on the side and a sweet black sauce, tofu is nice and crispy. Tasted just like regular fried tofu, nothing special. 

The dandan noodles...sooo good! Noodle tasted fresh, chewy and soft, the bowl has a strong peanut smell but did not taste overly buttery if that makes sense. It was creamy and sweet but not to where you get sick of it easily. I'm usually not a fan of dry noodles like this but this was so good. I could easily eat the whole bowl myself and be satisfied. 

The soup dumplings were delicious. Not as soupy as I would have liked, the soup didn't come pouring out like the ones at Din Tai Fung, but the meat inside the dumplings were very juicy. Great flavors, sweet and smelled delicious. 

Fried dumplings, we thought these were pot stickers but they were little baos fried at the bottom. I have had these at so many places and although they have always been good, I was very impressed with these ones. At other places the bottoms were lightly fried, its a little brown and thats it. These were legitimately fried at the bottom, so crispy and crunchy, while the top part is soft and fluffy and the stuffing is also delicious. Everything you would want in a fried dumpling, a little crispness, softness and amazing flavors. 

Overall, very impressed with this place. The decor surprised me, the services was good enough, food was really good. Can't wait to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"First time trying this new restaurant and it was great!  Service was excellent as well as the food.  Large portions and the order came out quickly.  We enjoyed it very much and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and the location, authentic food and great service. The best dish by far is the Fried Pork chop and fried rice but try the steamed Dumplings and Braised Duck as well because it's all good...."}
{"text":"I don't know why a previous review said this place was expensive because even my Asian mom said this place is cheaper than the other places and that's always good if you're not eating your wallet empty. 

First thing that came is the gluten puff in shanghai style. It showed a picture in the menu and it came a lot smaller in real life. It tastes very good, tons of flavor coming through, especially the star anise. Just a tad bit on the salty side. Dish comes cold. This dish also comes with PEANUTS. 

The second dish that came is the shanghai style braised duck. Also very tasty. It comes cold which results in firmer meat but it's fine. 

Third dish that came was the pickled green mustard and pork pan fried rice cake which was extremely salty. Server also forgot to give us a spoon with this dish. It also came with a few pieces of pork. You have to balance the greens and the rice cake or else it's really a mouth full of salt.

The last thing we ordered I am still waiting for 30 minutes after the last dish came  - the shanghai dumplings also with peanuts. I think they forgot our order. We finished all of our previous dishes and it still had not come out. These dumplings are a little bit more doughy than I am used to. Meat inside is good, tons of soup inside despite the deflated look."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese foods in town of las Vegas. Specially the fried pork chop with the fried rice and also great service"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some XLB, so we were excited to give this place a try.  We arrived at the restaurant at 10:20 pm and they closed at 11:00 pm.  The service was good and we received our food pretty fast.  Well, we were the only ones in the restaurant after all.  We ordered bean curd shreds for appetizer and their Shanghai beef noodle and XLB.  The bean curd shreds had no taste what so ever. The beef noodle soup was good, but I have had better.  The XLB were made fresh, a tad bit on the small side, but the taste wasn't too bad.  Would I come back?  No. The food is a little too pricey for me.  I think I will just go out to LA to get my XLB fix."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday around 1:00 pm. It was very crowded. This place is brand new so it was very clean and nice mirrored wall decor. 
We ordered Whole salted duck ($21.95), half salted chicken ($6.75) and soup dumplings($8.75).
The duck and the chicken came out in less than a minute (Wow!). They were ice cold but the lady owner said that's how they eat in Shanghai. It was A LOT of meat for the price. Good source of protein but was way too salty to my taste.
Soup dumplings were OK. I think I had better soup dumplings at Wendy's Noodle Café (same shopping center). 
The service was very attentive. They spoke good enough English so no problem ordering stuff.
I do not see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"This little gem right by the 168 market is the place to go for some dumplings, soup dumplings, to be specific. They also have these good spicy wontons that I can keep craving. The place is nice and well kept. It was a lot modern than what it looked like on the outside. I've been here every week since I've gone the first time. My family and I have fallen in love with this place. Big portions with great tasting food. 

Must try: Pork chop over fried rice, Beef noodle soup, soup dumplings, dry noodle, and spicy dumplings. 

Warning though. I noticed that most of their dumplings contain peanuts. Just in case you're allergic!"}
{"text":"Wow.. Good service, good food,  what else could you all for?  Oh yeah... How about cheaper prices?

For a casual restaurant this is a place that you won't be afraid to take your caucasion friends to.  There are no hanging meats or animal heads anywhere. 

We ordered the cold tossed seaweed, Dan Dan  noodles and the Shanghai braised duck.

Seaweed. $5.95.  Compared to the price it was quite pricey.  The dish itself was a little too strong in DC weed flavor. Yep I know that sounds stupid to say that a seaweed dish that you order is too strong in seaweed flavor. However for those that have had this dish you know that it's almost too strong of an ocean flavor. A little too strong in seaweed flavor. Yep I know that sounds stupid to say that a seaweed dish that you order is too strong in seaweed flavor. However for those that have had this dish you would know that sometimes there can be an ocean/seaweed flavor that is too strong. The vinegar dressing is alright but there did not appear to be any garlic or green onion in it.

Dan Dan noodles $8.25. These noodles also came in a small portion.  There was no meat. The sauce was spicey, peanutty and delicious.   Surprisingly not too oily.   Guessing instead of chili oil, they put some type of green chili.  The noodles themselves were thin and actually al dente.  

Shanghai Braised Duck. $11.95.  For the price and portion very fair.  I'm guessing the duck was boiled and then chilled to minimize the fat and tighten the skin. (Warning to readers.. this is not a weight loss technique.  Please do. not boil then chill your bodies... you won't be able to find a refrigerator big enough. ).  Three duck is then drapped with a thick braised soy sauce.  It's sweet, savory and delicious.  For you Chinese yelpers, if you were lucky enough to have a good cook for a mom,  she probably made a braised chicken dish like this for you.  (Sauce had star anise).

Really good restaurant, just a over priced."}
{"text":"Good food, well prepared and presented.  Customer service was outstanding!  Recommend trying the house chili sauce .  Will definitely be back to sample more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Oh Ding's, where have you been all my life? Lol. I was the one to put this location on the Yelp map and haven't been able to stay away from it since they opened. We usually come here at least once a week and order the same great dishes. The fried pork chop (lightly breaded with a tempura like batter, super tender and lightly seasoned), the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) as well as the cold dishes - spicy beef tendon and beef tripe (they are topped with cilantro and chili oil) are our absolute favorites. Steamed stinky tofu is good here also if you are into that. Most places in town that even have stinky tofu seem to only have arrows option so it's a little different.  Any of their fried rice dishes are good too - I think it's all in the wok and how screaming hot they get it - but yet it doesn't have that burnt dirty wok taste.

I could go on and on about this place but you should probably just try it for yourself. It's not your typical Chinese fare - it's a shanghai style restaurant from what I've been told, so some of the other lower rated reviews from other yelpers that may have been expecting your typical Chinese fare may not be entirely accurate for this place. For example - the cold chicken dish as well as the duck - are supposed to be served cold in this instance."}
{"text":"I never know when a new Asian restaurant is opened unless my Asian friends tell me about them. Ding's is one of them. We decided to come here to try it out after the first week of grand opening and I'm so excited to report that it's definitely worth giving a visit. 

Located in the shopping plaza as 168 supermarket, it's not too difficult to find. You are given menus and an ordering sheet with a pen, then you get to work! 

We had the appetizer #2, I believe. It's the one with the bean curd, pig ears and tripe. It was perfectly seasoned with chili oil, sesame oil and cilantro garnish. Even my white friend couldn't stop eating it. 

The Dan Dan noodle is a little different than the Dan Dan noodle I'm used to. Ding's is more peanut based but it was still really flavorful and enjoyable. 

The Shanghai rice cake was good, not spectacular but then again I think it's hard to find spectacular Shanghai rice cake in the States. 

We also had the pork chop and pickled greens with fried rice. I thought the pork chop was a little dried and the dish can be avoided the next time around. 

The braised beef in the beef noodle was very tender and juicy. I usually don't like braised beef noodle because the beef is usually very chewy and get stuck in your teeth but that didn't happen with Ding's. 

The xiao long bao, steamed dumplings, were juicy and flavorful. But the dumpling dough was on the thicker side, which can be a turn off to some. I didn't mind it. 

The service was relatively good. You have a couple really hard working employees and then you have a handful that kind of daydream around, which I think is typical for a new restaurant. 

I have been coming back twice since my first visit and intend to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Some dishes here are average, the dry noodle varieties are one of the average bunch. 

Moving on to its greatest hits:  fried pork chop (can be ordered with fried rice or by itself), fried rice (there's something pleasantly different from the fried rice I been fed up until now), PAN FRIED WONTON (we all raved how delicious this is, we had the shrimp/pork variety), steam buns (xiao long bao), pan fried meat buns. 

This is a clean restaurant with nice waitresses. Owner was there when we visited and she greeted us warmly and made great effort to accommodate my picky friends (no onion, no scallion, no.... ) 

Menu is limited, mostly are Shanghai regional cuisine, which I'm just learning what the variety is about."}
{"text":"Awesome new shanghainese food joint in town. It is nice and clean inside. The food was good and flavorful and the service was great! I really liked the beef pancake wrap!!
Their sheng jian bao could have been more crispy and  less doughy in my opinion. The xao long bao could have also been more soupy. The meat flavoring inside these dumplings though were good and delicious. Will definitely want to come by to try other dishes!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that had some good stinky tofu and a friend gave us the info to this place. Didn't know a pho place we had tried way back when (Pho Sing Sing) had already closed and replaced by this joint.

Prices are pretty high here for what you get, and taste is hit-or-miss depending on the item. We tried a cold meat platter, stinky tofu, xiao long bao and a pan fried buns. Out of all of those, we only liked the cold meats and the pan fried buns. The stinky tofu was just stinky without any flavor behind it and the xiao long bao didn't even have liquid in it (also cost over a dollar per individual bun). 

I'll be likely to come again just to try some different items, but based on what I had, Ding's is so-so."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite new in Vegas. We found it accidentally and was very surprised with the excellent food and services. We like the beef wrap. It looks like a burrito but is good to eat. They use good aromatics beef and cilantro. Don't miss the fried rice with pickled vegetables. It is not greasy at all. 
Service was very good. They were very attentive. I went back a second time for takeouts - better than airplane food.

Easy parking and convenient"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with their service here.   The place is clean and the appetizer is really authentic, just what I'm looking for tonight.   The Dan Dan noodle was delicious.   I would definitely come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Food was bad.  

I ordered pork chop+ fried rice+egg
My wife ordered noodle with braised pork chop 

The pork chop should coated evenly with bread crumb but not.(even looks bad, but they served anyway) The fried rice was full of msg flavor and salty, the egg has two egg shall stuck on it.(shown on picture)

My wife's noodle soup was blend.  And the pork chop served like a pile of shxx on a plate not even trying to clean the edge and make it presentable.  I just want to present the fact not my emotion, so you be the judge (if you want to waste your money)."}
{"text":"We went there a couple of days ago. The food was either too salty or too spicy. It didn't matter what we told the server's. And the steamed dumplings, we each took a bite... they were only halfway cooked when they served it to us! The owner or manager, an old lady, came and took the dumplings back in to finish cooking. No apologies nor did she give us a full plate. It was sad and disappointing. An owner or manager shouldn't have this kind of attitude, like it's our fault for them not cooking their food before serving it to us. Not to mention we'd see her yelling at her employees out in the middle of the dining room. Have some class and do that it in the back. She tried to offer us some consolation at the end but it was too little too late. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Referred by my friend for this new Shanghai style restaurant. Come in lunch time and the place is about 3/4 full. Tables are enough, so no needs to wait since I only have 1 hour for lunch. Try their veggie fried rice and it was so good! It is the best among all Chinese restaurant I tried in Chinatown. Some place the fried is either too salty or too much oil. Their XLB is also good. Will try come back next time to try more. Price is average. Environment is nice and clear."}
{"text":"Good customer service, free to taste item, and good cooking food represent Chinese food!"}
