{"text":"Ils vous invitent à un souper pour vous vendre une batterie de cuisine à un prix fou, ils sont bien gentils mais tout ça est une scam et ils le savent très bien, ils nous ont aussi donné un forfait voyage avec 4 jours de croisière gratuite pour 2 adultes, qui est aussi une grosse scam après avoir fait les recherches sur internet...ils offrent aussi d'autres services non en lien avec la cuisine...scam par dessus scam.."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I purchased products from this scam company. Worst mistake I ever made. The knives and scissors started to rust within weeks. Pressure cooker dents easily and inside coating is stripping off after one use. The der triump is completely useless and the nonstick pan last a few week before burning all food! I am sooooooo angry. I feel lied to and cheated out of my hard earned money. This should not be allowed to happen to honest customers. Anyone know of a way to stop this company, I am willing to join any law suit."}
{"text":"We came here for a cookware demonstration tonight and we really regretted it. Their cookware is basically a very expensive and glorified pressure cooker. Although they try very hard with their sales pitches to get you to buy their products, they gloss over some key issues. For instance, they told us we would be eating a sodium-free meal, and they proceeded to put a can of Hunts tomatoes in the pot. These were not low-sodium or sodium free and as many know, canned tomatoes are not exactly \"healthy cooking\". 

Their version of healthy cooking is to undercook and steam all foods. This demonstration might impress someone who doesn't know anything about cooking, but if you know your way (even basically) around a kitchen, you'll notice the flaws in their explanations. 

Their office is located quite far east and is very much out of the way. The cookware set starts at 2300 dollars and although they try all kinds of gimmicks to get you to buy it, it's simply overpriced and not worth it.  The worst was that after the demonstration they nearly wouldn't let us leave unless we bought something. Don't waste your time with this."}
