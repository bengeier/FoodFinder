{"text":"I recently had the misfortune of ordering lunch at this horrible establishment after my wife had finished her little shopping spree at the Bombay Company which is situated right next to this poor excuse for a restaurant.  The place looks like a converted Burger Chef (or some other take out/drive through establishment) and is staffed by employees who seemed, at best, disinterested.   The menu is more or less a series of numbered pictures of prepared plates and the brain dead patrons (myself obviously included) order by advising the counterperson of which numbered picture they desire.  Foolishly my wife, thinking like an American, requested some rather minor and reasonable variations to her order and asked for one item a la carte.  Well, the response we got from the counterperson was a look of both disdain and confusion.  I could not figure out if the counterperson was ignorant, unwilling to assist an English speaker, completely unable to deviate from the ridiculous pictures, and/or all of the foregoing.  As for the food it was mediocre at best.  I could live with the mediocre food, it was the \"tooth-pulling\" experience of ordering that was unacceptable.  Best to steer clear of this place and if you need a little \"nosh\" while in the vicinity of the Namur Metro Station try Dunn's Delicatessen next door and give Amir a wide berth."}
{"text":"Nice place.

Very good middle eastern food at a cheap price.  Tasty, good portions for the price.  The hummus was excellent.  Ranks up with some of the best I've had.  On the down side, even though this is a \"fast food\" joint, the place should have some AC.  It was balmy the day we went and it didn't matter if you were inside or out, it was balmy.  Maybe they were going for the authentic middle eastern atmosphere?  Also, what's up with Montreal and their aversion to credit cards?  This place didn't take it and neither did a lot of eateries.  It was annoying!!! 

Nonetheless, a nice eatery in a pinch.  You know it's decent when a couple of lady \"professionals\" came in and ordered a whole bunch of stuff to go.  Even they need to eat."}
{"text":"Its the worst Lebanese returant I've been to in Montreal by far.... The chicken was burnt and hard and was painful to eat. The fries were undercooked and bitter from all the coriander powder on it. And the garlic sauce was too runny and the taste was off. 
I like the amir chain, but this location is a true disgrace for such a name"}
{"text":"Worst Shawarma I've ever had. I thought it was nearly impossible to find bad Shawarma but this was old meat that tasted like it was aged after they shot the animal it was made from by leaving the carcass on the floor for a week. The spiced potatoes had flavor but were undercooked and the price wasn't that great either. I will avoid this place like the plague from now on."}
{"text":"I do not think this dot is in the right place. I believe they serve breakfast on the square (outdoor patio with a red awning), next door to Jardin Nelson. We were tourists and it was a tourist trap. Overpriced disappointing food. Long wait. Run away!"}
{"text":"Got a shish taouk sandwich to go... Asked for no tomato's or turnips (nephew is allergic)... When he opened it, there were 3 little pieces of chicken, and half of the pita was empty. Totally ripped off !!!"}
{"text":"By far the worst beef shawarma I've ever had! I'm a big fan of shawarma, but this was just horrible! The beef was very mushy and had that strong lamb taste to it. I ate the shawarma yesterday and  literally get nauseous thinking about it even now. I love shawarmas but won't be eating it for a while because of this one. It was approximately $7 for the shawarma in pita. The only reason it even got a star was because yelp wouldn't let me post my review without at least one star"}
{"text":"Completely horrible food, the steak was a piece of rubber, the side dishes was without flavor, the rice was old, and everything from the atmosphere to the meal was unpleasant. Keep walking, don't go in."}
{"text":"Usually hit up the Amir in NDG, but decided to hit up this Amir as I was in the neighborhood and I was disappointed. Ordered the shish taouk platter, with rice - hardly any chicken on my plate, garlic sauce was very acidic and tasted terrible, rice was made with cinnamon (a lot of it) and it was terrible! Would not go back to this location I'll stick to the one in NDG"}
{"text":"The shawarma was tasty. Better than the ones I eat in Toronto. Although their shawarma was smaller in size, and I don't know if that was because we were in Montreal and that's the average size there or if it was because it was actually small. Nonetheless the place needs renovating, everything was dirty here. Very dirty place but we ate here late night around 1am."}
{"text":"Should have gone to IGA for lunch or McDonalds. Portions are measured to the tee. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Small portions and expensive. There was so little chicken in the chicken pita that I could have eaten 3 of them. Fast food atmosphere."}
{"text":"I only ever eat at three of the millions of Amirs locations: the one downtown on deMaisonneuve O, the one on Sherbrooke in NDG, or this one at Jean-Talon and Decarie which is the one I try to avoid whenever possible as it's usually terrible. 

Of the three locations mentioned above, this one has the worst service and the food is usually almost as bad as said service, its prices are higher than other locations for no good reason, AND they throw in these hidden \"extra charges\" wherever they deem necessary on top of it! 

On my last reluctant visit, we were in a rush but I so badly needed my shish-taouk fix and this was the nearest place to curb the urge. As it was rush-hour and we were so close by, we ended up eating at the JT location. I was hoping things would be different this time, but they weren't. There was the surly cashier and the testy guys throwing together one's food (they're actually not so bad, especially when you smile at them) who didn't make for a warm welcome, but I went for the food which was a little better than on previous visits, but still way too greasy (I don't have this problem at other Amirs). On top of it, we were charged an extra dollar here and there without any explanation (we didn't notice the charges on the bill until we sat down and started eating), meanwhile we didn't ask for anything extra!

The service I can get over as it's not exactly a sit-down-and-tip kind of place, but their food is always SSOooooOO greasy (or dry if you get the chicken kebabs) and their prices are still higher. If the food was better, I might not mind paying a few extra dollars but it's not! 

This location has a drive-thru window, not that their meals are the kind of thing I'd dare try and eat on the road, but for take-out, it's an option. I'd check to make sure all the items ordered are in the bag before driving away though--this place seems pretty sloppy and careless about what they do. Better yet, I would simply avoid this Amir if I were you."}
{"text":"Gave my order to someone else - heard MTL shwarma was delicious - may be so but not from here - total garbage"}
{"text":"This place is so bad I wish could give it 0 stars . The food is downright nasty, seriously. The Falafel's were seasoned horribly and were mushy, the chicken and beef schwarmas were extremely dry, and the clerk ringing us up was rude. It was also overpriced; 2.50 for a small fountain drink, really? This place sucks, avoid!"}
{"text":"I can't explain what draws me to Amir. I have tried several locations and I leave disappointed every time.

I ordered the falafel plate and the falafel are cold. The accompanying salad is nothing special. Just some iceberg lettuce and a few tomato slices. The hummus is pretty good but the garlic sauce is nothing like traditional middle eastern garlic sauce but more like a garlic infused mayo. 

I've decided to stop torturing myself with my bad choice so I'm going to toss it and find another place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Bon le premier avis que j'ai fait etait negatif, car ma premiere experience a ete mauvaise ! Finalement, j'ai recommandé quelques fois de la nourriture à ce amir et le service etait très bon ! La livraison est un peu longue , mais ca vaut la peine car du amir c'est toujours bon !"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and good middle eastern food near the Berry-UQAM train station. We walked the stretch of Catherine street and decided to stop by for a quick lunch. 

The shish taouk and shawerma platter is the bomb! Also get the potatoes with garlic-yogurt sauce. 

Cheap and easy! Just like some of the people you'll see down on Catherine street."}
{"text":"Went to the shop in St. Hyacinth QC, when I asked if they took American Express, they said no, I said ok, I have other cards, I was told they only accept Canadian cards. 

If your from the US stay away from this place. What sort of chain doesn't accept credit cards? I think I was lied to."}
{"text":"Good Middle Eastern food that's open late late (I'm not sure, but they could be open 24 hours). Naturally a good place to stop for food after the bars and clubs. We were here at 4am last time. Food came quick and was cheap, as well as hot and tasty! Several locations around the city and there's one right across from Gouverneur Hotel where we usually stay."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible customer service.  For me customer service plays a huge role in every dining experience.  So the attitude of the employees throws me off."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some middle eastern food, so I tried Amir. The assorted shawarma  ($9 without tax) comes with rice, hummus, pickles, tomato, pita bread.
It was okay  and portion was decent but kinda forgettable. Don't think we will go there again."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from this place several times. Unfortunatekr most of the time the orders have come wrong. I don't know ifnits a language problem or they just don't care, but these guys never get it right. Example: We ordered a couscous veggie plate, but we got a 5-choice veggie plate; we ordered 2 chicken plates (1 with just chicken and rice, and 1 with just chicken, rice and potatoes), we recieved 2 chicken plates slatheres in garlic sauce and salad dressing. Lockily I know how bad this place is ans we checked the order before paying. We refused the delivery and then the deliverybguy called the restaurant. Of course they blames it on us, and they said that we ordered the wrong things. I told thendelivery guy to either bring us the correct order or just cancel it. He left with the food and 20 minutes later showed up again with what seemed like the correct order. The couscous veggie plate was correct this time, but the 2 chiken plates were totally disgusting. Back at the restaurant, they simply emptied the delivery tins of the food, scraped out the garlic sause and saled, and then put the rest back in the same delivery tin without cleaning it and sent it back. Obviously we only noticed this after we started eating. This is simply gross and whomever did this should be ashamed and fired. Bottom line...don't order delivery from this place because they simply dont care about their orders. We will never order from there again. Unreliable and gross."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, price was right and food was tasty. Ignore these other comments."}
{"text":"I eat out everyday.  So I don't live here but find my way thru Montreal 2x a year.  The food price value is excellent. Try the Combo Taouk Shawarma platter. And the old guys behind the counter are fun.  It's not fine dining if that's what your looking for."}
{"text":"Amir is a chain of Lebanese restaurants, but each one is franchised so they are all a bit different. I would actually rate this place a 3.5/5 but I rounded up for the sake of making good when they made a mistake in delivering (this is one of few times it's happened over the last, oh I don't know...15 years or so).

My family has ordered her regularly for a long time, and I'm not sure if it's been the same owners the whole time, but the food is pretty good for \"fast-food\" style shawarma, shish taouk, and even a bit more upscale items like shrimp skewers. They have a number of vegetarian items, so if you don't eat meat you'll be able to have a meal here no problem. They have a large seating area with space outside in the warmer months, and like I mentioned before, they do delivery.

We had a little get together chez nous tonight and ordered in some platters of mini items a few days in advance. When the order arrived we realized that they had forgot to send an extra order of hummus and one of garlic sauce (which is super garlicky, not a good idea on a first date). So we called them back, and they didn't even bat an eyelash, they sent the sauce right over with a huge bag of pita bread. It might not seem like a big deal, but that was a nice touch. 

I didn't realize no one else had reviewed this location since it's so popular and right across the street from a metro station, but maybe next time I'll remember to take pics?"}
{"text":"It's similar to other branches of the chain. 
I visited mid-week around 18:00 and the place had a few tables, but was mostly quite. I had a shawarma combo which was fine... nothing special. as expected. the toilets were not the cleanest I've seen. otherwise, it was nice to seat there, and I got some work done, since I had about half an hour to pass before seeing a movie."}
{"text":"first of all it is very expensive to order just about anything. 
second it has half of the menu which is not available as the do not want to open the grill. 
third the food is tasteless. 

i paid $24 for a small shawarma plate and a sandwich. what a shame."}
{"text":"The chicken is tasty, but everything else in their Shawarma platter is poor quality. The potatoes are often sitting luke-warm for hours, and rice is always cold (they microwave it but that doesn't help much), if you're desperate or it's late at night this place is decent but otherwise just not worth it."}
{"text":"So I stopped in just to get a quick bite while out alone. The wife isn't adventurous and wouldn't eat here anyways. So I was not familiar with anything on the menu, but the Shish Taouk seemed a safe bet. The wrap was okay, I found it a little bland and boring.

The staff were pleasant, had a rushed order-now feel to it. Coming from the Boston area I'm used to it, people who move at a slower pace may be put off by this. But it's the type of service you get at a busy deli or take out restaurant. It's an experience, just go with it. 

The nice thing about this place is their open late. So if you're enjoying the fine drinking establishments along St. Catherine Street, you may end up here. I will admit that I wished I had tried some more stuff here since this is Lebanese cooking."}
{"text":"Ordered a shish taouk trio . All I got was a lettuce sandwich with some chicken inside...pretty much crumbs. Never going back again"}
{"text":"After a late night out while walking back to my hotel my stomach started to rumble.  This was the only place that I saw open so I decided to get some takeout.  That was my downfall.  I got the chicken shawarma plate - chicken, rice, potatoes, hummus, pita bread etc.  

No surprise that the chicken was so dehydrated that late at night that it was barely edible.  But  when you are hungry and tired and have no choice you make do.  The potatoes and rice weren't too bad so I ate more of that, a few pieces of chicken to satisfy my hunger and went to bed disappointed.

Someone told me this is a chain restaurant but thankfully I never saw anymore around Montreal as I would have run in the other direction.

I couldn't really comment on the service because my friend did all the speaking to the staff in French for me  :)"}
{"text":"C'est sale la nourriture n'est pas bonne. Les navet mariné ne sont pas bons les sauces ne goûte rien. Et pour couronner le tout on m'a fait réchauffer des patates dans le four micro-ondes...lol"}
{"text":"Un libanais super-décontracté juste en face du Parc Émilie-Gamelin et à deux pas de l'UQAM. Vous passez votre commande au comptoir, elle est préparée devant vous et vous passez à la caisse. 

Les assiettes sont super-généreuses et la nourriture d'excellente qualité. Si vous avez votre carte d'étudiant, n'hésitez pas à la présenter à la caisse pour bénéficier d'un rabais. 

Les longues tables permettent aux groupes de partager leur repas ensemble. Il n'est pas rare de voir une équipe sportive, une troupe de théâtre ou un groupe de voyageurs attablés à cet endroit."}
{"text":"AMIR, Y U NO EXIST IN NEW YORK CITY???

I grew up going to Amir every Sunday... and whenever I go back to Montreal for XYZ reasons, I ALWAYS, ALWAYS stop at Amir.

I have been ordering the same thing for years:

Shish taouk pita (no tomatoes, no \"navet\") with garlic potatoes, a side of garlic sauce, and a soda. O.M.G. just thinking about it makes my mouth water! 

One thing is for sure: I will never ever ever ever ever order anything else. Shish taouk pita is just too good to pass up."}
{"text":"I think this is the Amir off of Cresent St. We hit it up after bar hoping, and were all suprised with the food. We got the Farlafa's (chicken, lamb, and chick pea), they were all delicious and super cheap. Great eats for close to nothing."}
{"text":"The service was slow.  The cashier was rude.  The staff seemed confused and stressed, and it wasn't even that busy.
I go to a ton of Lebanese places, this is not a good one.
Other than poor service, it's rather expensive compared to others, the food is overly salty.
It gets 2 stars for being a very clean location and the food was fresh and colourful.
I wouldn't choose to come back here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for Middle Eastern food, at least in Montreal, they are a chain. Good shawarma sandwiches, falafel, hummus, tabbouleh...good for a quick lunch or a tasty snack and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was starving and it was late, so I decided to go for it. I ordered the shawarma plate and it was packed with potato salad, rice, veggies, steak, and one piece of pita bread. The beef was so so dry and partially burnt, I had to eat lots of rice and potatoes with it to kill the taste. It's one of those times when I wish I had done research instead of just walking into a random place to eat.

They offer wifi here, which works great. Besides that, I would skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"Un bon shishtaouk en sortant des bars ça comble toujours son homme. Délicieux, malgré l'endroit qui est  d'une propreté douteuse. Bien situé avec terrasse et bien sur ouvert jusqu'à 4 heure."}
{"text":"The worst Lebanese food I have ever had. I am only giving it a 1 star because that's the lowest it goes.  Old, dried out, flavorless junk. Don't waste your time here, it's terrible."}
{"text":"the only bad thing we ate while in Montreal. ordered the shawarma pita with just hummus and israeli salad, and the chicken was dry and flavorless. i asked for well done pieces and the idiot (young guy) behind the counter who was more concerned with what was going on outside gives me pieces that hasn't been charred by the spit. what a waste of a meal."}
{"text":"I don't know what possessed me to come in here as I don't usually like or eat Middle-Eastern food but the next option at 10:30 at night was McDonalds. Lamb was burnt, the place is seriously overpriced. I don't know what the one reviewer here saying that it is cheap is talking about..I looked and it seems that their only options are for dishes above ten dollars.."}
{"text":"Hey!  The food is great and there is a lot of it.  You need to watch your money with the cashier though.  The one cashier gave back really incorrect change on a $20 Canadian note.  Knowing that people are either drunk or tourists, must be too tempting for this place to not try this trick.  

I got the combo meal for $12 CD and it was very delicious and good."}
{"text":"They do not accept credit cards without a chip.  They send you to an ATM."}
{"text":"I have tried and tried to find a Chicken Shawarma that is as good as Amir's but haven't yet.  The garlic potatoes also rock!!!  It is sad because I don't live in Montreal and only get to enjoy this little piece of heaven periodically.  ;-(  Please, please open a store in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The Best Amir EVER. Point Final!
I've been to many and this one has the tastiest food ever. 
Always fresh because it's super busy and a ton of choices!
Must try and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"I wanted a gyro and this place was a block from our hotel. We got one chicken the other beef. As we were leaving I noticed the fish tank was nasty dirty, odd. We went back to the hotel to eat and it was awful!! Chicken was dry and the beef tasted really weird. It didn't even taste fresh and hot. I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"I was craving a shish taouk so I came here and I was honestly disappointed. First of all, they gave me the smallest shish taouk I've ever seen and there was barely any chicken in the first half of the shish taouk. On top of that, all the chicken concentrated on the bottom were burned so after I finished the shish taouk the taste of the burned chicken remained in my mouth. But I must say, I have had shish taouks here before and they were okay and this was just one bad experience."}
{"text":"Service tres négatif ! Le serveur a un language très déplacé envers ces clients . La nourriture est immangeable je déconseille fortement ou alors en derniers recours ."}
{"text":"I was missing the spices from home (Israel) so I decided to go to Amir (close enough). I usully go to Basha but I said lets try something new....Well I wont do that again. I always that the vegetarian plate, this one was with 3 very dry Falafel balls (why cant you do good ones like the green panther of FA avenue ??? ) and 3 salads portions, at least at Basha you can choose your salads.. .
Anyway boring lunch that filled the hole in my stomach but killed my will to live..."}
{"text":"Who knew that the people working here were paid to make fun of those who didn't speak french? 
I certainly didn't when I stopped in to order some food on a regular Friday night. 

To management: I hope you seriously take a look at who you hire in the future.  Even though I don't speak french, my friend certainly did, and didn't appreciate how your staff rudely made fun of me for not speaking it. They're paid to do their job, take orders, and make food, not give their opinions on their customers. 

To future customers: spend your money elsewhere unless you want to be rudely berated. An absolutely disgusting example of montreal customer service. 

So glad I didn't end up spending money here after they insulted me. I will never spend money at another amir restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Good Middle eastern place located all over Montreal. The prices are good and you get a lot with your meal. Here you will get your typical shawerma and kebab with a side salad and hummus. 

If I'm not mistaken most of the Amir's in Montreal are open 24hours."}
{"text":"Just another nice Amir food nothing more but renovated food court and very clean.
I always like eat pita when hungry."}
