{"text":"Decent option for healthier food if you don't have time to wait in line for Fresh. Moderately warm, decent variety of dishes, and palatable enough if you can cope with the limits of small cafeteria style cooking and serving. My mom would not have approved of these dried out pirogies, but it is the end of the day and they're fine enough after being  bathed in the eggplant tomato dish for a few minutes. I'm certainly not rushing back, but I am grateful to have been rescued from a night of greasy, veg-unfriendly pub food."}
{"text":"This place is located within a health store called Noah's (way at the back).  They have a good size \"buffet\" bar where you pay by weight plus soups, wraps and some snacks.  The buffet bar is $2.60/100g which is average by Toronto standards, but pricey by mine.  However, the food is quite good and seems to be prepared daily and very fresh.  They have an assortment of salads, cabbage rolls, tofu and lentil inspired dishes.  I've tried their hot dishes twice and also had a samosa.  While I loved the food, the problem is that it isn't very warm or piping hot and the samosa I had was practically frozen and no offered to warm it up for me.    I might visit again, but only if I'm passing by.  It's great takeout food, not necessarily food you want if you want to eat something there before a workout or something."}
{"text":"Ditto the other reviewers: a welcome spot for a quick veg friendly meal that sits on the more affordable side of the sliding price scale in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry this is decent place to get some vegan food. Hours are limited and honestly if I'm around Noah's and hungry I'd rather just grab a protein bar from Noah's."}
{"text":"I used to like this place and didn't mind spending extra money to get quality items but recently my soup tastes watered down, my avocado roll has less avocado and contains the small stem at times, and my \"fresh\" muffin was clearly a few days old."}
