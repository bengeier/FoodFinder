{"text":"Great breakfast and the price is right. This is an upscale greasy spoon without the grease! The service is also commendable. A small, cozy diner that is comfortable."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I really want to like this place. I like that it seems to be a family run place.  I have have had some really good breakfast here, but I have also had some really awful breakfast here as well. Today was not so good. Our food took an unusually long time considering there was only 2 other tables. When it finally did come, the potatoes were a greasy mushy mess, my over hard eggs were just barely over easy, and we were almost finished before the waitress came to see if we needed anything else, which we did as I am one of those people who can't eat toast, especially cold toast, without jam. They really need to work on consistency."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 rating, I would...  I mean, it's not like you can't get an average run of the mill, eggs over easy with toast and sausage here...  when you slap the word diner on your sign, that's kind of expected.  But in Leslieville, a community that makes outsiders feel like they live around the corner, we're willing to except a less than michelin star dining experience, as long as theres a little bit of love in the air.  And there was no love in the air that morning I ran past this restaurant, 1 km from home, dying to use the bathroom.  I remember the elder lady not exactly being the picture of grandmotherly warmth the one other time I had sampled the breakfast and frozen tropicana special, but somehow, I thought she might see the desperation in my eyes that morning, when no other restaurant was open, to let me make use of the facilities...  We were new to the neighbourhood, and feeling the Leslieville love like a giant Carebear rainbow every corner we turned.  So you can imagine my surprise when after hearing my plea to pee, Grandma looks at me and says flat out, 'no pay, no washroom'. I generally am a person that always looks for the good in a person, always wants to learn from the rich experiences of our elders, but in this lady, i saw nothing but bitterness that morning.  I wanted to love this place... after-all who doesn't need a local diner around the corner.  Unfortunately, after my experience with the not-so-golden girl, I will not ever be heading back."}
{"text":"Peppery home fries, perfectly cooked eggs over easy.  Fresh squeezed juice and decent coffee. It wasn't that cheap with the juice came to 12 bucks and for that you can go to lady marmalade but its close and no lineup."}
{"text":"In any other part of Toronto this place would rate higher as an ok place to get a good cheap breakfast. 

But there are so many other excellent places to eat in the area that I would give this one a pass. The food was ok and cheap but took forever to come.  The place was noisy and the service was friendly.  Like most places in Leslieville, it's cash only.  

You could do worse. But you could do better too."}
{"text":"Leslieville Diner is fine.  Really. We visited on a cold Sunday morning for cheap breakfast. Spinach Omelette with very buttery toast and potatoes for $6.95. Eggs, Bacon, Potatoes and Toast for $5.80. Decent coffee.

The only negative was the lady sitting directly behind me recounting the ENTIRE Harry Potter Series in alarmingly minute detail (complete with her interpretations) non stop the entire visit. LOUDLY. So much for quiet breakfast with morning paper. 

Its a greasy spoon for sure, no frills, semi casual service.  Of course there are a tonnes of better options in this neighborhood, but Leslieville Diner came in at half the price. 

Decent, filling, cheap morning grub, fresh coffee. Its A-OK."}
{"text":"We were actually sitting at the table behind yours that morning, Jimi.  I was watching your story unfold pretty much as you told it, and felt bad for you (and especially your wife).

I agree with most of what you've said.  I've written a shorter review on leslieviller.com where I essentially described everything as mediocre/average, but the food is home-made and very well-priced.  

I've been three times now... I find if I stick to going for simple food (i.e. burgers, breakfast special, homemade soup, homemade pie), speak loudly for the waitresses, and pay more attention to my newspaper than the decor, I leave pretty satisfied.

To contrast, we had breakfast at Okay Okay this past Saturday.  We probably paid 50% more for the same food (an order of pancakes, a classic eggs/sausage/toast/potatoes breakfast, coffee, and tea), sat at a counter with our knees crammed up against the underside, and were served McDonald's style hashbrown patty.

So as far as cheap, home cooked food goes, Leslieville Diner will probably get more of my money than Okay Okay."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of diners that I would put in the same category as this one.  About 30, in fact (see list below).  I don't mind greasy spoons...in fact, I seek them out (see list below).  Keeping that in mind, there was something about the vibe of this place that I didn't like.  It just didn't feel like entering a restaurant.  It seemed more like some other kind of space...with tables.

That said, the food, for the most part, was perfectly fine.  Up front I'll say that there were 6 of us.  (A 7th came 40 minutes later, but I won't figure her service into this review.)   The service  and prep time was their major weakness.  It was slow.  Without getting into details (and I have them...I made notes), my eggs, home fries etc., came 7 minutes after my toast.  The waitresses (accurately described by others), did a good job keeping our coffees filled,  but otherwise seemed reluctant to take our orders.  OK, one detail - our food, or rather the toast, came 25 minutes after we ordered.

I believe this only the third of 40 breakfast places I've reviewed to which I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"i'm new to the neighbourhood and because we were pressed for time, we hit this place for convenience's sake. it looked like it'd be fast & cheap & our ability to foresee the future was spot on. i wasn't in the mood for eggs so i settled for the grilled cheese & onion rings (breakfast of champions). it's diner fare so i didn't expect to have my tastebuds blown and no, there were no explosions in my mouth. the onion rings reminded me a bit of harvey's onion rings (this isn't a bad thing) and the toast was in the frying pan a couple seconds too long (this is). the server we had was attentive and our food came quickly. my breakfast companions had no complaints about their food. the bill didn't break the bank so all in all, i'd go back again!"}
{"text":"My S.O. and I enjoyed breakfast here recently and both agreed that it was, quite simply, the best breakfast diner food we've ever had.  We've had many meals at the Sunset Grill, The Victoria Street Grill (R.I.P.),  The Tulip and we've enjoyed the People's Grill and the Avenue Road Diner (I'm guessing at the names a bit cause I don't remember these ones on the west side as well).  Of them all, Leslieville Diner was by far the best.  

Every element of the meal was the best version of that item I'd ever had in a restaurant.  The peameal was perfect - not overcooked as is so common.  The potatoes were wonderfully fried and not mealy or greasy.  Eggs were good.  Toast was very good.  Service was good.  All in all, the best bacon and egg breakfast I've had in 30 years.  

We'll have to try it again to make sure that this wasn't just a one-off alignment of the celestial bodies, but if it was, I'm sure glad to have been there."}
{"text":"i was never really looking forward to trying this place all that much to be perfectly frank.  the sign looks like no thought was put into it. half the tables and chairs match each other and the other half match as well, but are a different style.  they have these peach coloured walls that dwarf the few small unremarkable paintings they have posted up around the space.  this is all to say that it looks boring and lacks character from top to bottom.

nonetheless, its new in my hood so i decided the night before as i passed it going home that i would go there the next morning for breakfast.  

both waitresses that were working were in their fifties to sixties and the one that was helping us, though she seemed nice, was obviously flustered with her position.   we ordered simple stuff.  my wife ordered a mushroom omellete, and an oj.  my order was the same except it was a spinach omelette.  neither came with cheese inside which we both found disappointing.  moreover, when we brought it up, she didnt even suggest that the cook could put it in or that she'd ask.

a few minutes later our orange juices come and they were gross concentrate minute maid crapola.  i actuallly dont know what i expected any different.  i shouldnt have ordered it;  it reminded me that i dont mind at all to pay for freshly squeezed or at least something like tropicana.

then my spinach omelette arrives, and a minute or two later my wifes western omellete arrives.  wait a second....thats right.  we both spotted the offending ham inside the omelette and no mushrooms.  when we brought it up with the waitress she said my wife ordered the western omelette.  this of course is absurd and virtually impossible since my wife is a vegetarian.  shes probably never said the words \"western omelette\" in her life.  the waitress was so inept, she said she was going to go over to get her pad to confirm.  LIKE IT REALLY MATTERED.  just take it away, say sorry, and get the new omelette right away.

the food.  pretty bland, but plentiful.  i ordered a side order of bacon. 4 pieces at 2.65.  their hash browns were okay.  homemade with slices of potato.  they were sparsely spiced, so ketchup was in order. both the spinach and mushroom omelettes were about as tasty as we expected considering the lack of cheese.

at the end of the meal, we were brought an indecipherable meal that seemed to not include the price of one our omelettes, yet somehow managed to hike itself up to some kind of total that included it.  when i went up there to try to get some answers, the other waitress, who seemed to be the one in charge, couldnt make sense of it either or me.  

total waste of time.  i could easily think of another three places that are simple diners - same food, better, and more character, and more professional service - in my neighbourhood in a second."}
{"text":"This place is a solid three stars. To be honest, I being a westie I made the trek out to Leslieville for brunch at Rock Lobster. We planned for 11am, RL doesn't open until noon. #FAIL

All that to say, we got seated pretty quickly and for a diner, the food was pretty standard. Everyone liked their respective egg dishes and I went for a breakfast basic, bacon and eggs. Breakfast for under 10 bones in the city is unheard of. So there's something said for that. Plus, during the week, a standard brekkie of eggs (3), homefries, toast, coffee and a choice of pork - sausage, bacon, or ham is $4.99. Every frugal bone in my body loves that. Plus, I enjoyed the mural and hand drawn photos on the walls done by kids.

With all the up and coming, too cool for school places - ahem, Rock Lobster, the neighbourhood needs places like this. If I lived in Leslieville, this would be my local breakfast joint for sure.

NB - Cash only!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4 stars for food, but the service is just that bad. The owners grand- daughter is a grumpy b***h on the best days. The owners friend (french woman) is friendly but usually behind the grill. The owner herself is sweet as can be.

The food is very good for the price. Be prepared to more or less have your food thrown on the table (once she knocked the creamer bowl off the table). 

For a local greasy spoon, it lacks the family-feel of a local cafe. Sad, because it's so damn convenient. Sad, because it could be so much better with just a smile.

They don't take credit cards, so beware. There isn't an ATM anywhere close, either.

While you're there, visit SandyAleksander across the street. You'll realise the difference between sh** and sweet customer service."}
{"text":"You have to be looking for a greasy spoon to enjoy this place. It's a great brunch spot without the lineups but it does get quite busy in this cozy restaurant. N.B. I've only ever had their breakfast dishes, unsure how good the rest of the menu is."}
{"text":"Food was standard a diner like this. Prices were reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"My sister moved to Kingston this week to start at teacher's college at Queens.  She was coming to pick me up from Niagara, and she called me from Oakville to say... well, she called to say she was in Oakville.  I decided that I probably had 40 minutes before she arrived and headed down to the Leslieville Diner, pretty early (8ish) on a Saturday.

I sat down and ordered right away, because I didn't want Beth to be waiting around for me at my house.  The food took a LONG time to come (over 20mins) but I forgive this issue as it was early and I was the first person there.  I would rather have food take a long time to get to me fresh, than have stale heat lamp food anyday.  I bet if you went later in the morning you wouldn't have to wait this long.

The waitress was old and we had difficulty communicating.  I just took whatever she brought me, and it was pretty close to what I originally asked for.

The bacon was kind of meh.  The hashbrowns were surprisingly okay, but they weren't the best I have ever had.  They were definitely above average - hashbrowns, you can be surprised by how amazing or how horrible they are at these kinds of places.  So they were on the 'good' side of that equation.

It was very reasonably priced, had a horrible ambiance, and I would probably go there again.  I did not omit the word not; I will eat here again in the future.  And bask in it's mediocrity.  I probably wouldn't take other people there unless I didn't care what they thought of my taste in diners."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the value of $5.50 (including tax) for a three egg combo. Even Sunset Grill can't offer three eggs, home fries, toast and bacon or sausage for that price, unless you show up at an ungodly hour like 8am for the early bird special.

My eggs were perfectly done, toast was nicely buttered and the addition of sliced tomatoes was nice in place of meat. Homefries could have used some spices like paprika or cumin to liven them up - the texture was great but they required heavy salting and ketchuping. I didn't leave an iota of food on my plate.

I don't feel out of line mentioning that my server (who appears to be the owner's mom) was not well versed in the art of hospitality. Peter (the owner/cook) came out to ask me how my food was, but she didn't. She spent most of the time behind the counter sorting jam packets or whatever she was doing back there. There was nothing particularly egregious about my service experience but it just wasn't very welcoming or attentive - when I ordered the combo I wasn't asked how I wanted my eggs, type of toast or meat, nothing. She came back later to confirm those options but really it should have been noted immediately. At a diner I expect the service to be friendlier.

Decor, as mentioned by others, is forgettable. Think the early days of IHOP (Buffalo locations only) church banquet hall. Certainly not befitting of the \"diner\" name. Booths would be nice.

Leslieville Diner has only been in the neighbourhood since the beginning of the year, and with an improvement in service (perhaps hire some young, peppy waitresses who'll put a smile on the weekend breakfast crew's faces, yeah?) I can see it sticking around!"}
