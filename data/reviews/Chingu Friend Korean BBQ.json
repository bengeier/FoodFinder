{"text":"A nice, no-nonsense Korean restaurant.   Tasty side  dishes (ban-chan) and good spicy beef stew.   Will be returning to try other dishes on this trip to Toronto"}
{"text":"Chingu is back but not AYCE anymore.  The place decor is very fast food/take out shop style as not much spent on the decor.  Staff was friendly and food was good as always from Chingu.  The staff kept refilling our side dishes as well.  Got the Korean BBQ (need to order 2 minimum) the portion is larger than most Korean restaurants and it comes with one soup(Gam Ja Tang or Soon tofu). Also unlimited lettuce which is amazing as most place charges $3-$5 for a 2nd plate what a rip off.  We ordered 2 BBQ plates and it was a lot as it fed all 3 of us. Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"The food taste ok, the bbq price was little bit higher than the places I usually go; the service was a Nono. The bill total was $30, give them $40 cash and ask me if I need change?? And when the girl picking out changes, she keep ask her supervisor if she give the changes in the right way, and the supervisor looks mad with I said I need my changes back first. Well, I always give at least an average 15% tips, depends on the services sometimes higher; but I never expect a restaurant ask for 30% when their service wasn't even good. The lady supervisor doesn't seem nice and being pretty rude to the waitress girl. I was happy when I find a Korean restaurant that's so close to my house, but in this situation, don't really wanna go back anymore.

PS: Budweiser in this place taste like water!!"}
{"text":"This is an average Korean restaurant that you will typically in TO. Nothing particularly good but not bad either. However, in this location, I think it's like the only Korean restaurant around in the neighbourhood. It still looks new as the furnitures and walls all looks quite new. Not much to expect from the decor though, just table and chairs under white florescent light.

I go there for lunch there 2 times before, both they are not \"cheap\" in offering the side dishes. They are quite generous in fact. For one person, I got like 6 side dishes. I normally ordered the pork bone soup, so after tax, the bill is like $10.89 + tips. Not too bad. In terms of the pork bone soup quality, it's comparable to other Korean restaurants I have been to. The soup is bubbling hot with big pieces of pork bone inside and with flavorful pork broth.

The other item I have also tried before is the beef short ribs on the sizzling pan for about $18. The taste is ok but my complaint is that the ribs that comes out have a lot of little dark bits sticks to the ribs.. my guess is the grill they put the ribs on is not perfectly cleaned and still have  lots of burnt pieces and thus transferred to the food. That's just my guess based on the look of the ribs.

But all in all,  I will still go back to that location .. I have been there 3 times already. 2 lunch and 1 dinner."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Pork bone soup came off the bone and melted in your mouth. Service was definitely subpar . After paying, the cashier refused to let me go because there was no paper in the machine so the receipt wouldn't come out. After making many attempts to make me pay twice and promising that she would e-transfer me the amount. A gentleman behind me fixed the machine and printed the receipt out for her as proof. This was the biggest waste of time in my life. If you ever come here make sure they got paper for their credit card machines or else they'll accuse you of not paying and you'll be there for a long time."}
{"text":"I had a craving for soup, ramen, meat, and whatnot during a winter week. I decided to stay in north Richmond Hill area. 

Food: I chose the budae jjigae, which had vegetables, 3-4 slices of pork belly, sausage (it was hot dog), luncheon meat, cheese, instant noodle, and baked beans. I chose the 1-person size. I don't  like it but I finished it anyhow. The ingredient was really cheap choice. The place was nice enough, and the people working were really nice. I would come again to try other dishes because it might have been just my choice of dish. Still, every dish should taste good and not something I can concoct with an instant noodle package, when I don't even make an effort to excite the instant ramen. 

I will come back again and try other dishes. The review is really for the dish I chose, which I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Real Korean family restaurant, good appetizers and meals.  The 4 of us had the pork bone soup, bibimbap, spicy beef brisket soup, and budae jigae. All food was good would come again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this Korean place for the first time.  The first thing you notice is that this is kind of an equivalent of Korean fast food.  The seating is mostly cafeteria style seating with benches along he sides-one side note is that the chairs have no cushioning remaining on them and we felt like we were sitting on a piece of wood.

The Katsu was decent and not well done or oily.   The rice was decent.  Our pork bone soup was good and hot: However, our potato was cold on the inside-maybe we came early and the soup did not cook enough yet.

Not what I would classify as an exciting experience.  Just quick, average Korean fast food with polite service.   One more thing-parking is a breeze in this little strip mall."}
{"text":"First time through a friend who told us about this Korean place. 

Pretty good. 

- more appetizers than Owl of Minerva; comparable to Nak Won (highway 7 and Woodbine)

- ordered Pork Bone, Chicken Katsu and Bibimbop. Great choices and had a sumptuous lunch. 

- also had dumplings on the side, nothing special about this. Dumplings are dumplings. Sauce goes very well so that made it a cut above other dumplings 

- quiet area and along west side of Bayview, not that visible from the street. It's right beside Little Caesar's which is a lot more visible

- will definitely come back next time"}
{"text":"Not a lot of ingredients in the dishes, personally I think they skimp out on a lot of the meat and veggies. Price is on the higher end, very limited menu. 
Side dishes were not that good either, too salty or oily."}
{"text":"STUFFED! Some people say that the mark of great food is walking into a place where the majority of patrons reflect the food. Here, Chingu is  just that. A vanilla guy walking I to an authentic Korean BBQ joint can be a bit daunting. But no worries, as soon as we arrived, we we warming greeted and attended to hand and foot. Not only describing the food on the menu and various options which all looked awesome, but walking us through the preparation of the BBQ hot plate cooking process.

We started with ordering house made rice wine, which is kept in house for a maximum of two weeks to retain the optimal flavour, which is a fermented rice with a pungent kick. Very unique and delicious. We settled on the bulogi meat and BBQ ribs, prepared on the BBQ hot plate for about $40.00 for both, served with a choice of soup (we order a spicy seafood and tofu o share) and Kimchi on the side. Suffice it to say an ambulance of food for $75.00 all on with tip. 

Seeing my struggle, the lovely waitstaff came by multiple time to help with the preparation of the meat, which we made lettuce wraps which were phenomenal! What a lightly sweet and tangy BBQ flavour. We also mixed with rice and a delicate peanuty flavoured sauce. Lots of food! 

Like the other reviews, this is a.must try spot tucked away at Elgin Mills and Bayview. The same place as Little Caesars. If you want a truly authentic Korean BBQ experience, you just try Chingu. For a first timer like me, you will certainly get a lot of 'hand holding' if you need help with the heat of the BBQ. Everyone is incredibly nice and friendly, and a great option for a date night. Enjoy! -Zuk"}
{"text":"Its a pretty decent little place. Had the Yookgaejung, flavour was good, didn't detect that much MSG, beef could have been shredded, but overall pretty good.

Second time I tried the kampungi chicken. Do not get that dish. It's like eating Chinese chicken balls. 

Decor is diner style, they could have better lighting, maybe some spotlights instead; its lit up like a McDonalds.

Friendly family restaurant, close to home. Was a full house on Friday. Service is very warm.  Overall i like it and will continue to go back :)

Lots of K's go here too."}
{"text":"This place is so Korean and its refreshingly nice. Situated in a relatively quiet plaza, this is a no frills Korean restaurant. One factor I always look for at a Korean place are the older aunties who (I assume) gain experience from cooking for their families. 
My wife and I had our \"go-to's\", Kimchi Jigae (kimchi stew) and Soon Dubu Jigae (Soft tofu stew). The kimchi stew was well cooked to the point you get that tomatoey taste. It was on the spicier side and quite sour if you like that. The Soon tofu was spicy too and was packed full of soft tofu and seafood. The stew was so filling that I couldn't finish it. FYI, a raw egg is put into the stew before serving. Each stew comes with the usual bowl of purple rice and priced at $9.95.
Service was straight forward as the lady was not fluent in English.
Would definitely come back for authentic and no frills Korean food."}
{"text":"Authentic, good quality food. Friendly service. Ample parking. One star off due to very poor, ie, lack of, ventilation. (Another table was having Korean BBQ, and the entire restaurant became smokey and smelly.)"}
{"text":"I have not a slightest idea the average quality of the numerous Korean restaurants on Yonge or Bloor Street.  Hence, I am reviewing Ghingu as it appears to me in a single dining experience. 

And I loved it.  We ordered a hot pot to share ($30 for 2 people).  It came bubbling hot. The two-person portion can feed three easy, because it came with instant noodles and 2 bowls of rice.  The broth was the star of the dish.  It tasted really authentic.  It was spicy to me.  We asked to have it diluted but it was still quite spicy.  If you love authentic Korean spiciness, you will love it.  Otherwise, consider yourself forewarned.  The pork belly meat was fresh and thick.  The sausages were delicious, but I wish there were more.  The tofu could be more silky.  

We were given 6 banchan.  They tasted very good.  Kimchi and spicy cucumber were my favourites.

The services were quick and friendly.  The ambience was simple and causal.  This is a neighbourhood, family dinner kind of place.

I noticed there were 2 tables of Korean diners.  One table ordered the BBQ, and another table ordered the hot pot and pork bone soup.  I took it as they considered Chingu as authentic.

Will I return for more?  Yes."}
{"text":"Favorite Korean restaurant in Richmond Hill. Has the best pork  bone soup in town. The place is actually owned and run by a Korean lady so the food is very authentic. Large selection of side dishes, Kim chi was good. Small place, not a lot of staff but service is good and quick."}
{"text":"I went in expecting nothing because I didn't think Richmond Hill had any good Korean joints...and I was wrong!  This isn't your typical nice looking, fancy, \"Sariwon-ish\" Korean bbq joint - it is literally a mom and pop's restaurant BUT...the food is down the earth, yummy. 

Their dishes don't come in fancy bowls and plateware at all but your'e getting some pretty good stuff.  Their BBQ prices are actually lower than most decent places (ie: Sariwon) but they aren't as cheap as that gross AYCE stuff.  

Side dishes are plentiful and they always make sure you have enough unlike other places, near Thornhill and North York who have gotten very stingy over the years. Overall, it's my go to place near home and I definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Best new Korean restaurant!! 
Friendly staff, excellent home cooked Korean food. 
Decent prices, take out or eat in always delicious. 
Their sides are different most days which keeps it interesting, and they serve that purple rice. 
I wish they were open 24 hours, so I wouldn't have to drive down to yonge and finch for mediocre Korean food.
Met the owner, wonderful women, explained she used to own another Korean restaurant and she does most of the cooking."}
{"text":"Another great, five-star meal at Chingu.  This place never ever disappoints.  You are guaranteed an authentic, real, genuine Korean meal.

The panchan and the main dishes (yeolmu kimchi nyengmyeon - my usual) are amazing.  The kimchi has JUST the right amount of fermentation ... nice and strong together with copious amounts of gochu garu - what could be better?  Seriously.  Nice owners and clearly they are doing great here - well deserved.  The lady who used to run a large restaurant who takes care of the panchan and quality control is a superb person - has high standards.

Amazing place.  Far for us to drive to - but worth it in time and ga$!"}
{"text":"Beef ribs, pork bone soup and bibimbap are so good. Appetizers like kimchi, seaweeds, cucumbers are the best in GTA. I tried other Korean restaurants (famous or not famous ones), but the appetizers and most dishes are not as good as Chingu.  It originally on Hwy 7 and West Beaver Creek.  I didn't know that they moved to Elgin Mills until somebody told me. This Chingu is the best quality I ever have!!"}
{"text":"This is our favourite Korean restaurant in the Richmond Hill area. The food is really good  love all their soup stews!"}
{"text":"this place is a Korean equivalent of a diner. However nothing fancy they make up for in taste and authenticity. portions in the menu look bigger than actual serving portions making it a bit expensive than the other Korean places. Hence the 3 stars. We ordered : the Beef Brisket soup ( I love this, meat soft and packed just the right heat ) ; Seafood Pancake (the kids liked and devoured as well as the fried pork dumplings) ; Beef Bulgogi (popular among the group) ; Gamjatang or Pork Bone Soup (preferred by non spicy eaters , just as good) ; kampoongki (good , but we had better elsewhere).

One thing we observed , if you're a regular and friends with the owner you get more appetizers and  a much warmer greeting."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here! The restaurant itself isn't much to look at. It's a pretty plain set up, some tables and few photos of the food on the wall and a tv with cp24 playing, but it's clean and welcoming. We were warmly greeted by a couple of the ladies working there and were told to sit wherever we wanted. The restaurant is in a strip plaza right off of Bayview with lots of parking and they have free wifi. 

Looking at the menu, there aren't a lot of choices but I like it when a restaurant chooses to focus on a few good dishes rather than have a large menu with several mediocre items. Plus, I'm not as familiar with Korean food so I wasn't feeling overwhelmed with a million choices. 

We opted to try to spicy pork with rice and the budae jjigae which was a spicy soup with a bunch of different types of toppings and noodles, I was nervous it would be really spicy but it wasn't nearly as spicy as it looked. Both dishes were fresh and flavourful. We really liked the side dishes, I think there were 6 of them which included some kimchi, potato salad, bean sprouts and some others. 

The service was really sincere and nice, everything came out quickly and they were quick to refill tea/water, etc...

A lot of people around us were having the table BBQ and I'd love to give that a try next time, it smelled amazing.

I will definitely return to this restaurant to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Although Chingu Friend Korean BBQ is so close to home, I have waited for so long to try it because I was skeptical when I see Chinese word on the sign. 

We decided to try it on Family Day long weekend. We arrived at very late afternoon, way past lunch time and the restaurant was empty. 

We ordered Katsu Don, Bulgogi Beef with rice, Beef bone soup and stir fried spicy squid. 

They came with 7 side dishes with substantial size. I enjoyed all side dishes except the kimchi which was spicy but lack of flavours. 

Quickly the food came and we all enjoyed it. The Katsu Don was nicely deep fried and crispy. The bulgogi beef was very tender. The beef bone soup was very flavourful. Spicy squid tasted delicious. All the dishes tasted home made and hearty. I agree with other Yelpers that nothing is outstanding, but the dishes taste authentic and \"normal\" as other Korean restaurants. 

I would definitely come back since it is so close to my house and the portion is very substantial. It will be definitely my family's go to Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Chingu has a really limited menu. There are not many choices even for BBQ aside from 2 types of meat.

I was a little disappointed. But since it just opened for 2 days, I hope they would improve of that.

Service was homey and friendly. 

Love the Kalbi and for $19, the portion is good. Gamtatang ($8.95 with grand opening special at $6.95) was meh. The pork was meaty but there was hardly have any soup and it did not served bubbly hot. Same with the Beef Rib Soup ($13.95) it was lukewarm and the meat was still really chewy.

I might come back but there are so many better Korean Restaurants, Chingu would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"So good!!!

I'm so happy that a location has opened close to me that serves delicious Korean food. 

The staff is super friendly, one of the ladies kept checking up on us and refilling our side dishes (all one can ask for). On that note, the side dishes taste really fresh and there is a variety of them when compared to other restaurants. 

The quality of the main dishes are great. The staff cook with passion and provide an authentic dish for their clients, all at a decent price. The menu is kind of limited but it does cover most of the dishes one would want to go back to get. 

They have improved a lot since they opened, I just wish they were open 24 hours so I don't have to mission to Yonge and Finch when I'm craving some Korean food."}
{"text":"HOLYYYYYYYY KOREAN BBQ this place is absolutely amazing. It's honestly a hidden gem! It's located in a tiny plaza with a Little Caeser's that a lot of people casually drive by but YOU HAVE TO COME HERE!!! You don't have to drive all the way to Finch station or Korea town, nor do you have to deal with stupid one-way roads and annoying parking procedures.

First off, I need to mention that the owner here is AMAZING. The servers (although they look really tired), genuinely want to provide you with the a good experience. They definitely are passionate about creating memories for their customers by serving good food. We never had to remind them to refill our tea, and they always asked whether we wanted more side dishes!!! YES!!!

Second off, the enviornment was REALLY good too. Like most people in the review mentioned, the place is really decently priced, so a lot of the utensils are just very ordinary. There's no consistent theme (cafeteria vibes tho) since it's NOT trying to be upscale. I think of the place as almost a korean home.

As for the food, here's the dealio: DO DO DO get the table cooking combo. It comes with A GAZILLION generously portioned side dishes. 

Side note on side dishes:
- Lotus root - sweet and good but a bit too oily
- seaweed salad - delicious, kelp is the hard to chew type
- fishcake - can't go wrong
- kimchi - good
- radish - good!!!!! my sister kept refilling this one. She says its done better than buk chang dong soon tofu
- bean sprouts - standard
- japchae - this one i'm not a fan, way too oily ... not enough seasoning
- there were others i forgot about

SO  BACK TO TABLE COOKING, it also comes with a FREE SOUP. You can choose kimchi stew, seafood soft tofu soup, or pork bone soup! Soft tofu soup is defs the most popular and best bang for your buck. It tastes REALLY good. Flavours definitely come through. Only complaint is that the soup wasn't bubbling when it was served (aka it was only lukewarm, which I think defeats the purpose of stone bowl).

Finally as for the BBQ, i LOVED the bulgogi. Definitely get the bulgogi. It comes with onions, garlic, oil, chili paste, and onions to cook with. They also give you lettuce leaves to wrap the meat with. The bulgogi is really tender and flavourful. The steak slices on the other hand, were a miss. I would honestly order two servings of the bulgogi (you need to order two servings to qualify for table top cooking deal) because it was really THAT good.

Honestly!!! You need to try this place - I love it THAT much. I'm  so excited to try the other dishes this place has to offer.PROTIP: come around 5-6PM. After 6PM, the place gets SUPER crowded."}
{"text":"I used to work for Ms Lee for 2 years. Ms Lee is a sweet sweet extremely sweet Korean lady. She previously owned Chingu Korean BBQ restaurant in West Beaver Creek. (Which I went in and ate every other week back then even if I worked there almost everyday!) I see some comments below stating it's not that same owner, I can guarantee that they are all WRONG! Side dishes are always refillable (well, unless you go and refill 5 times..that's a bit over.) So many side dishes, compare to the ones at yonge and finch, they only give you a couple and SORRY no refills or maybe you can only refill for certain dishes for twice). Quality wise, it is definitely still great. She cooks with so much passion, I love it. Very authentic, decently priced. I'm so glad she reopened Chingu, now I don't have to go all the way to yonge and finch. 

Now, go see for yourself."}
{"text":"Please note!  This restaurant isn't the Chingu BBQ at West Beaver Creek - from what I've been told they are the same owners though - thanks Jenny!  This place has no real table top BBQ for those who are looking for that and come to this place.   They are in the place that Solo Maria used to be. 
Now to the review.  3.5 Stars - extra half because it is new and they need time to make adjustments. 
The meal here is not stellar, but more of the same that has been popping up all along Yonge Street.  We had the SoonDuBu, GamJaTang, and Chicken Katsu.  The Katsu was a little thicker than I liked it to be and was a little over fried.  The SoonDuBu was the seafood variety and it would have been good if the seafood was not tiny morsels.  The GamJaTang was pretty standard fair - tasted like the one from the Owl of Minerva.  There was a good portion of pork in the meal and plenty of soup.  It was also served really HOT!  So hot that I am now writing this review with blisters.  Ugh.  The GamJaTang was $7 for their grand opening.
I like the word \"Grand Opening\" but their was nothing grand about it here.  The place lacks life in the decor - stark white walls, and the service - needs a caffeine boost!?!
Is it a return visit place?  With plenty of parking and not having to wait for 30 minutes at ChoSunOk - our main go to place, it would be a yes.  I'm also always a sucker for giving new places a try or two or three.  Let's see how it goes.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with my husband and 1 year old daughter now.  We like that the staff are willing to steam rather than fry some dumplings for our daughter, even though that's not on the menu.  The pricing is not particularly cheap, but the taste is great and the food is authentic.  We've travelled to Seoul to visit family there, so we've had our share of genuine Korean food and this place did not disappoint!  

My husband loves that their pork bone soup is cooked long enough that the meat is tender and actually falls off the bone.  Their other chigaes (soup stews) are also full of flavour and well seasoned.  The BBQ is authentic as well, although it's too bad they don't have more ventilation to extract the smoke from your table.  Side dishes are generous and come with a decent variety.  Our daughter also really enjoyed the pajun (seafood egg pancake).  

We also like that this place has a family mom-and-pop-shop feel to it (so far consistently 2 ahjummas and 1 ahjussi running the place).  We'd return again. :)"}
