{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous brunch at Das Gasthaus with my German beau and will certainly be returning - and soon!

While we were sad to see the resto was quiet, it worked to our advantage with Ã¼ber fast service and personal attention from front of house staff and management. 

Our food came out fast, tasty and authentic to it's German roots and we were very pleased to hear of the local sourcing in ingredients. My guy's pints were perfectly poured and my \"Hugo\" German Mimosa was a refreshing treat. 

Thanks for the fabulous food and service Ruthie - we've already raved to friends and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well.  This is a rarity.  I don't think any restaurant has ever made me feel this unwelcome just 15 seconds into the deal.  The website had made me think the place was a large and classy place, when in reality it is the size of a Bloor St. dive bar.  The tables and chairs were cramped beyond belief, and even though I walked in on a weeknight at 6:30PM with only about four other patrons in the bar, and there were several booths free, the bartender insisted that I sit in the most uncomfortable section possible, the squatter-like chairs and tables close to the entrance, cramped with the four other guests in the place when over half the place was empty.

I had been prepared to overlook all this because a friend -- who was German -- had said this was one of the few places to get authentic German food.  But as I waited...and waited...the bartender didn't seem interested in getting me either a menu or water, and seemed more interested in chatting with the men at the bar.  By the time I did get the menu, I was pretty annoyed, and my annoyance mounted when I looked at the pathetic menu, where there seemed to be only about two entrees large enough to sate my considerable hunger that evening, of which one was actually unavailable that evening, I was told.  And $17 for a pork Schnitzel?  Wirklich?  Breaded pork cutlets that you can get for about $6 anyplace else?

When the water still didn't come after five more minutes, I just walked out.  Nothing will compel me to go back to Das Gasthaus."}
{"text":"Sitting in the window looking out on this lively stretch of Danforth, my husband and I enjoyed a nice glass of wine and enormous schnitzel sandwiches on pretzel buns.  Not a chance we would be able to eat it all.  Delicious!  Loved the music, the weird German dayings on the chalkboard and the whole vibe.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  The owner is friendly and makes you feel welcome.  The problem is the drink prices.  Black Tower (aka quietly poured as \"Dornfelder\") is more than $10 a glass.  Niagara's Between the Lines Riesling was $16 a glass with tax.  The whole bottle goes for under $16 from the winery.  That's a pretty steep mark up."}
{"text":"Hello Ruthie. 
Thanks for following up

My soda stream beverage was Non-Alcoholic as I was driving that day. And it was not made fresh - the server that day pulled a pre filled bottle out from the bar fridge and poured it directly into my glass - the machine a top the bar was never used. 

I ordered a soda stream with a flavor shot of sorrel I believe. The flavor shot had so little flavor I asked for an additional flavor shot. Sorrel is something I'm very familiar with and should have been more flavorful. 

We had one app and we shared a dinner plate. 

The server we had that day was not very helpful nor was he compassionate to our comments which is why when we saw the $27 soda stream on our bill we paid and left without comment."}
{"text":"Good service, convenient location but the food was subpar. I bought a 2for1 deal for brunch and would not go back based on the eggs Benedict type meal I had. I was hoping to be able to give a better review but I will not be returning. I wish businesses would not offer groupon type deals if it means the quality of the food will suffer."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food is very good. The rosti was nice and crispy without being burnt or oily.  The house made sausages were fantastic; extremely fresh and properly prepared.  I really enjoyed the beet butter and the staff seemed very friendly.  It was cash only but staff assured us that they would have a debit/credit option soon.  The hand-painted walls and variety of hanging chandeliers brighten up the restaurant.  They have a very nice beer selection and offer a variety of unique cocktails.  The house-made shady is lovely.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"It was very good and I would definitely go back.  Good food, good atmosphere.  The mains were a little pricey, but the starters and sides were quite reasonable, especially for the quality of the food.  Everything tasted fresh and home-made, and everyone at the table particularly enjoyed the soup of the day.  It was nice to have German food that was little more refined than other restaurants I've eaten at - the serving sizes and balance of the meal were perfect for me and I didn't go away feeling like I'd eaten a whole pig.  We all had soup, some shared appetizers, and a main.  The beer selection was good, I really enjoyed the Hofbrau.   I had the sausage plate, it was delicious, and the flatbread appetizer was a hit.

The atmosphere was relaxed, no need to dress up, and the service was great.  The only complaint was that they came and gave us new menus while we were deciding.  The new menus had slightly higher prices, and I think it would have been more professional to charge us the lower price, or just not give us the new menu."}
{"text":"First things first, it's a very lazy walking distance from Broadview Station. Score! That means you now have a reason to leave your car at home, stop blaming the weather for being a hermit and finally get your German jollies on. 

Secondly, I love all things brunch: it starts with my favourite letter, it's a portmanteau word, and it's a great way to glamorize drinking with breakfast; albeit, Russians insist that champagne for breakfast is only appropriate for aristocrats and degenerates but I digress...

Das Gasthaus was my choice for the first brunch of 2014 for various reasons: it's located in the area I'm sentimentally attached to, it's very conveniently situated and like most Eastern Europeans, I'm a carboholic. Hey, if pizza as a vegetable was good enough for U.S. congress, I'll do them one better and add vodka to that list. Bite me. It's a potato. 

As I was strolling along Southside of Danforth, my mind was already entertaining my stomach with fantasies of various livers, bratwurst and sauerkraut, while sheepishly shooing away any involvement of beer. Yay, I'm going out for German! AND my first time dining alone, ever. OMG, I'm almost a well-functioning adult! Good grief, this weather is gross, can't wait to eat something substantial... 

It was pretty hard to make out the atmosphere from the outside, which only intrigued me further, so as I pulled the door open, what initially met the eye were a variety of adorable chandeliers and a *gasp* gorgeous antique blue velvet bench. The charming, intimate place smelled inviting and a pretty floral paining on the wall instantly made the restaurant feel like a cozy home of a pedantic frau. Yes, it was that clean. 

I wasn't greeted by a frau, I got a warm welcome from Marc instead. As he bid farewell to a couple who were just on their way out (and appeared delighted), I decided to park myself at the bar. It was still quite early in the afternoon so I was pretty excited to have the place all to myself. Marc mentioned a few specialty drinks he had been offering, one of them being hot chocolate with mint schnapps, which I am looking forward to trying one evening in place of dessert. Second suggestion was hot cider with rum. Third option was....couldn't tell ya. He had me at cider, I couldn't think of anything more perfect on a windy January afternoon.

It definitely hit the spot: the perfect blend of acidity and sweetness, infused with the comforting scent of cinnamon and just the right amount of rum to warm up your frozen heart without setting your lungs on fire. 

\"I'm SO hungry! What would you recommend?\" 

Marc offered me a very uncomplicated, easy to understand menu that varied from light fare to substantial \"hungry man\" options. I settled for the golden middle, choosing the classic two eggs, roasted potatoes, thick cut bacon and smoked Gouda. 

\"It's served in a small skillet\", Marc smiled.

While waiting for the meal, we were engaged in a pleasant conversation about the decor: the mural, the furniture origin, our favourite dining spots in Toronto, our mutual love for Queen St. and large canines. He evidently exuded passion for hospitality as well as genuine support of local business owners. 

My food arrived on a humble wooden tray, in a petite skillet (as promised), with some fresh fruit and toasted rye on the side.  If much like yours truly, you possess the grace of a cow on ice skates, I suggest starting with the fruit not only for proper digestion purposes, but also to keep face and avoid scalding yourself. By the time you're finished, your food will be at the adequate temperature and cantaloupe fruit is best enjoyed ahead of the meal anyway (IMHO)

The eggs were fresh and cooked perfectly, with silky yolk oozing all over crispy bacon and cheese-coated potatoes. No extra salt or pepper were required. I was only halfway through my cider and although I am not a fan of drinking with my meals, the subtle acidity settled the richness of eggs while cinnamon enhanced the smokiness of beloved Gouda beautifully. Potatoes were well-prepared, not mushy or hard, but rather that perfect roasted \"al dente\", if you will. And bacon...Well, bacon is bacon is bacon, and when it's a proper thick cut variety, the only thing you're left with is deciding whether to pile it on top of rye or devour it like a caveman. To be honest, I don't recall if I even used my utensils for that part. I'm pretty sure I threw my manners out the window for that one. I attack my bacon with bare hands, I don't think there's a way to be lady-like about it.  

\"You know, Ruthie loves smoking. She does this wonderful thing with eggs, you have to try them some time. She calls them Russian eggs and they are wonderful, with dill....\" Sold. I've never had smoked eggs, please let me know if you tried them. 

The touching finale of the meal was a hand-written bill. How like Europe. I will be back for dinner. Bye-bye social anxiety over dining alone. Thank you, Das Gasthaus"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic schnitzel, and the braised cabbage was awesome. Also really good strudel. If you like German food, this place is the real deal. Not exactly cheap, but the place is cute, the food is the real deal and there's a good selection of beers."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good - they have interesting German beers. The atmosphere could use a pick-me-up but it really shouldn't be in that state given it's only been open a couple of weeks. It felt more like a cafeteria - the bench that lines the restaurant looked old. An investment in the atmosphere could help the restaurant given the immense diversity and choice on The Danforth. 

The service was fine. Ordered the charcuterie board of meats - it wasn't a very good selection and no explanation of what we were eating (other than the obvious of salami). There was only one choice of cheese. We also ordered the only 2 options for entrees. The veal wiener schnitzel came with gypsy sauce... it was very orange and the taste was a really odd pairing with the veal. Probably should leave it just plain. The spaetzle was delicious. 

Extremely expensive given the options at the moment. Chef/owner mentioned she would be expanding the menu in the near future, but until then, likely won't return. 

Also...cash only..."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best and extremely overpriced. Service is horrible. Do not go!"}
{"text":"Our server seated us promptly and was helpful in assisting with food and beverage choices. Our drinks and food arrived quickly. Everything was delicious! Great, warm environment, I'll be back and I highly recommend others to check it out."}
{"text":"What happened?   Was the Chef absent today?
Out of our party of 10, 8 were disappointed by the food.

The beef brisket had absolutely ZERO flavour -- I had to borrow some mustard off another diner's pretzel just to get through it.  The potato salad was so under-cooked that we had to send it back.  We were given roasted potatoes which was exactly that.  No seasoning, no salt -- a big pat of butter made it tolerable.  

Apparently the schnitzel was OK and the stuffed pasta was good but considering there's only a choice of 4 mains, you'd think they would be at a higher level.  I asked my German friend if this was how German cuisine tastes like.  He said NO."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious brunch at Das Gasthaus yesterday.
Warm welcome from the owner.
Charming atmosphere.
Delicious German food.
A great alternative to our usual Brunch places."}
{"text":"very good food, and on both of our visits have been served by the same gentleman. At first he seemed a little awkward but we quickly found that endearing. 

The place is small, but adequate, and the service has always been spot on. We don't drink alcohol, and this hasn't been an issue. (I am sure they have plenty of German beers,a nd we are probably missing out, but I don't care).

We will be going back, and it is becoming a main-stay on our west-Danforth outings"}
{"text":"We came here tonight for wine, but will for sure be back for dinner soon! I got SO hungry watching the beautiful dishes go by, but I already had dinner plans. The schnitzels looked AMAZING, and I hear on Wednesdays it is all-you-can-eat schnitzel, including vegetarian schnitzel.  Our wine was lovely, and service attentive."}
{"text":"We had bought a Team Buy coupon but were told that they were not honouring them due to problems with the Co. In some respects we thought this should be a problem to have been sorted our between Das Gasthaus and Team Buy. However failing that, a more empathetic attitude might have been to offer their customers  free coffee, one free breakfast or something along those lines. But just a \"hey this is not our problem\" kind of shrug was all that was on offer. We would have been customers 2 and 3 at the time on what should be a busy Sunday brunch day on the Danforth. 

This is the 3rd time I have been in. There have been unfortunate issues each time (flooding once / no air con another time). Even this time there was an odd musty smell that may have been plumbing related.   

I liked the food, but not so much we'll be tempted to try again."}
{"text":"Our group of 3 decided to eat here after a long day of walking in the city. We thought we would try this little joint for some dinner.

We ordered a pretzel which was really good. It came out warm and soft and was served with what I assume is homemade Dijon mustard. The schnitzel was also good but not memorable. The outside had the perfect crunch and crisp but I would have preferred it served with a sauce rather than butter. 

My biggest issue with this restaurant is the service. When my table ordered waters to start (which after the day of walking we had, we could not get enough water) and as our waiter was walking away he made a comment that made me feel awkward for the remainder of my meal. 

I am not a walking dollar sign and I appreciate not being treated as such. Considering the place was almost completely empty when we sat down, this little hipster gastro pub was lucky to get our business. 

Though the food was good, this is a place I will not be returning to."}
{"text":"Some of the best schnitzel I've ever had the chance of eating. It's so very flavourful and very authentic. Paired with one of their German beers on tap and you're in heaven. Reasonably priced, definitely my new favourite German house in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had! I had a breakfast schnitzel with two Fried eggs over easy, which the waitress assured me he yokes would be really oowie goowie runny. And they where hard. The schnitzel was about 6 inches, overcooked and I don't even know what kind of meat it was? dried out and a sour flavor, a few home fries that were flavorless, a few pieces of fruit and a glass of orange juice. That'll be $25 Sir. ??? I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Dinner food selection was sparse and tasted...meh. Service was aloof; even though the owner was there, one would expect some friendly chatter from the proprietor with the few tables occupied by real guests. Well, that didn't happen and our entire group of 9 left the restaurant without that warm, fuzzy feeling of being welcomed. An establishment not worth the 18% compulsory gratuity. Nothing stood out and I would not go back again."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that my roaming isn't working otherwise I would have known that this is definitely a place NOT to try. I went to see a physiotherapist around the corner from here and decided to grab a bite here afterwards. My son was sleeping, the place was empty so my husband and I proceeded to eat there. I figured that there's really no way to screw up a schnitzel or potatoes so I'm sure it will be good. Well I continue to learn something new everyday. We waited 35 minutes for our order. At one point I asked how much longer and they explained that it took long because it was made from scratch. Our food arrived and guess what? The schnitzel was burnt! What's more upsetting is that I can hear these people in the back just blabbering away the entire time. They were too busy in their own conversation that they burnt our food! They get 1 star because the waitress was nice. I'm sure they're not out if business because they sell beer. I was very upset because we waited so long so I sent it back. They had another one out for us within 5 minutes! Really???? So you lied about why it was taking so long? Ugh! Besides bad service they lie to you too. Not cool people. Not cool."}
{"text":"I had a great experience tonight. Very warm service, awesome beer selection and good German food. Nice place to spend a Friday night in February."}
{"text":"I met Chef Derek Mikensky outside this resto one night and I recognized the face from somewhere. I said hi and walked by but I kept thinking \"I know this guy\".  I stopped myself, turned around and walked towards him. \"Are you on TV? Restaurant Takeover?\" I asked and he replied with a laugh and smile \"Yes\".  We got to chat a bit and he told me that everyone wants to open on the west side but he decided to open in the east end because it's a really cool area but nobody really knows about it...yet.  I've always thought the east end was such a sick spot which is why I moved back but it needs the recognition.  I am glad he opened a German place here because I'm all for different cuisine in the east.

The decor is awesome because it's simple and homey but some nice chandeliers and paintings keep it fresh and hip.  They only had one server but she was on top of it.  We say by the bar, which is always my fav spot because you get to see everything go down especially if they had an open kitchen close by.

We ordered the Poutine, stuffed pasta, potato salad and a charcuterie board.  I really wanted to try the schnitzel and sausage but they were out of it, which means business was good on Sunday.

The food was fresh, tasty, and hit the spot and the beer selection was excellent.  Forget which one I had but I asked the refer to give me a recommendation.  It was light but tasty which is what I like if Guinness is not on tap.

I will have to come back here soon to try the items that were sold out but I do recommend this place for their food, chill atomspherre, and great friendly service.

Thanks Chef glad you recognize the east!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited Des Gasthaus. The first time I went with a German friend of mine.  We had the happy hour pretzels and beer and ate a variety of small plates and had few more beers. She was impressed with the authenticity of the offerings. It was a Friday night and the place was packed!

I returned on a Tuesday evening in time for happy hour (4pm -6pm) where, as advertised on the website, pretzels are $1 and 1L of local beer is $10. We started with the happy hour pretzels and beer. We then ordered the schnitzel (greasy and tasteless), lamb/pork sausage special (freshly made in house and very good) and had more beer. We shared the apple pie for desert and it was tasty. I told the server that I had visited a few weeks earlier and had come well out of my way to visit again.

When I received my bill, I saw that I had been charged $9 for the two happy hour pretzels instead of $2. When I pointed out the error, the server said that she was recently told that happy hour for pretzels is from 10am to 12pm (this is fascinating, considering the restaurant is not even open until 4pm on Tuesdays!), and not 4pm-6pm. When I showed her that the pretzels are clearly advertised on the website for $1 each from 4pm-6pm, she stared me down unpleasantly, and was not willing to budge. 

To me, this is a breach of contract, and overall, quite arrogant. It appears that the place is doing well enough that it does not care about keeping its word. A repeat customer like me who travelled to the other side of the city (and dragged a friend along as well) instead of going to a local place in my own neighbourhood, is evidently just a drop in the bucket for them. If you do choose to visit I'd recommend that you ask the server about pricing, and that you take a video of the reply, because clearly you can't trust their word in writing.

My two stars reflect the high prices and the fact that the establishment does not honour its own website.  If I were to judge the food alone, I'd give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Highly mediocre food for surprisingly high prices.  The atmosphere is lackluster, the waitress we had not particularly attentive--overall a very shrug-worthy experience."}
{"text":"Kickass joint.   Had some white sausage and some Schmukers.

I was entirely satisfied with my service. The owner even came out and saw to my satisfaction. Das gashous is a lovely place"}
{"text":"I really liked the place! The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and so are the selection of the German beers! On both times I've been here I've ordered the Charcuterie and I like it. The only reason I haven't given a 5 stars is because they never put enough bread and the fish (herring) is not very good. Next time I'll see if they can change for something else or try something new :)"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to discover this little gem in my hood. The server was prompt and she had helpful suggestions in picking a pint among the selections on tap. I had the blue cheese mushroom dumplings and the Elk special. The Elk came perfectly cooked the way I ordered it, which I don't take for granted in any restaurant. It quite literally melted in my mouth. I was sharing the generously portioned entre with a friend who strangely doesn't like mushrooms, and she had hers sans fungus, and I had mine with mushroom deliciousness. It has great lighting, (no bare bulbs anywhere) with cool looking vintage chandeliers everywhere. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Just went for \"All you can eat sausage Tuesday's\" which should actually be named \"all you can eat French fries\".
We paid $35 for two of us and could only eat 1 sausage each.. Since you have to eat a pound of fries with it before getting another order of sausage. 
So our bill was $70 for a couple drinks, a couple 5 inch sausages and 2 pounds of fries.
This doesn't include the terrible service we received while there which included \"I don't know how to pronounce it, I'm not German\"
And not even telling us that it was all you could eat sausage Tuesday's. When I asked about it he didn't give us anymore details other then \"you can't share\"
Misleading and overpriced for some okay food.... Unless you like French fries, which in all honesty where good, just not $35 good!
Didn't like it from the start, wish I would've left earlier."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch! Visited with a travelzoo coupon but well worth the regular brunch price.  I had the breakfast schnitzel (because that's a thing), partner had the french toast pretzel.  Great food,  different,  nice coffee (with refills) too. Relaxed atmosphere, good service. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an indulgent bunch treat. Can't wait to go back to try the breakfast board. Also looking forward to trying dinner.  Great addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"4.3-ish stars. A little expensive and a little sweaty (no A/C??). But the service was more than on point and the food was clearly prepared in-house. I believe the place is supposed to take on a North German Theme (think Hamburg).

Had the 3-sausage plate along with the personal-sized cured meat board (ie. without the cheese and the boiled eggs) which came with house-cured salami and a house-cured sausage. Both were excellently delicate, had a strong porky flavour and the sausage was clearly made in a proper sausage casing. They also had a purple \"beat butter\" and really coursely-ground mustard. I probably asked for way too much of both...

The sausage from board reappeared on the sausage trio entree, and was definitely the standout of the three. It had a nice sweetness to it. It was paired with with potato rosti (or cold potato salad, if you so choose) and house made pickles.

Beer selection was unsurprisingly German, with local brewers' takes on German styles but most things readily available at the LCBO (no Schneider-Weisse though :(  ).

I think I overheard the owner say that they are going to try and incorporate more wild game like deer, possibly rabbit onto the menu."}
{"text":"I've lived near the Danny for 35 years and have sampled just about everything. It took me forever to try Das Gasthaus but it was worth the wait. It is becoming my new local - Joe Allen down the road has fabulous food and drinks but is very, very noisy. Das Gasthaus is homey and cozy. We immediately made friends with Ruthie, the server, and Dagmar in the kitchen. On a subsequent visit wound up having a conversation with the woman at the next table and then a man at the bar chimed in, and before you know it, the place felt like somebody's living room. I was raised with mittel-Europa food, so the potato salad felt like home! Nice touches of pickles and marinated onions everywhere. Delighted to learn they serve Brickworks hard cider from just up the road, and a beautiful amber ale from Hamilton called Piper that we were sure was German. A wide variety of dishes of every size that makes it great for breakfast, brunch, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. Just so happy to have found it."}
