{"text":"This was my second attempt to attend one of their shows. There was an accidental overbooking and I was bumped, but they sure made up for it! I am SO glad we attended the event and the box office staff made it so easy to plan the event. It was a special night for my sister's birthday and I wanted to do something special with just her and I. We loved the night and I can't wait to see their next show! Thanks SO much! \"Ooohhh!, Aaahhh!\""}
{"text":"While the food was just okay, we had a great evening.  If you want some high energy entertainment and a lot of laughs, this is something to try. When I first got here, I thought that being in a Coco's was a.little weird.  Although it was a little hokey  - it ended up being a fun evening."}
{"text":"We went to see Murder Mystery Mansion held at Oreganos., Dec. 2016. The room was excessively crowded.  Could hardly move around.  We had 10 people to a small 8 person round table.  Ugh.  Afterwards both my husband & I commented on fire code regulations!!! The plot of the play was weird & the actors not great.  Food was edible but not great.  Would not suggest to anyone nor would we go back to anything with this cast.  Disappointing for the cost as we haves loved Chicago murder mysteries."}
{"text":"We know we love Aunt Chiladas, when we heard the Mystery Mansion Dinner group was going to perform there, we quickly got reservations. We have seen the group before in their other venues..but the show never gets old.....The spontaneous humor from each cast member blends very well..  The food is always great. it was a buffet style...the food we had was the perfect temperature, and taste. We will continue to follow this group wherever they play next!"}
{"text":"A Good Time!! Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. If you have a sense of humor and want to do something fun this is a good idea. It includes dinner and desert and has a full bar. The characters are really fun and into their roles. Very personable too! It's silly and fun and there's lots of interacting with people at your table/actors. They go out of their way to make sure you're included and taken care of. I suggest it for a fun and different night out, especially for a date!!"}
{"text":"They did a wonderful job of putting on a show, attending to all of the guests and making sure everything was running smoothly. We attended to celebrate my friends birthday, they took care of her gluten sensitivity so well. They made her feel special and all the other guests who were celebrating. We had a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group of people (about 30) to this for a fun night out. We've never been and didn't know what to expect. Well it's not what you'd think if you expected a tv style who done it. That being said it's seriously entertaining and a heck of a good time. Be ready to participate and laugh your rear end off. We saw \"murder at the vampires wedding\". They involved people from our group. They were great at improv with our audience and had us laughing he entire time. Well be back to check out another show in the future I'm sure."}
{"text":"Went last night to Scottsdale Oregano's show and it was a total blast! The cast really gets into it and it's just plain good fun. Oregano's italian food served buffet style was good maybe 3.5 stars, pizza, pasta, you order drinks on your own tab. A lot of reviews say the food is just okay, but honestly it's about the show and food was just fine. My wife wanted veggies not available on buffet and they accommodated her with all smiles, it's very good service from both the MMD people and Oregano's servers. They seem to have all the details down pat. All in all for the entertainment and food a good deal no doubt especially for a night out in Scottsdale. I'd definitely do it again - it's something different and great to spice up \"date night\" birthday anniversary or just a fun night out."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, to say the least.  Tacky venue and the food was just okay but the entertainment was really good!  The actors are energetic and professional.  You can tell they take great pride in their performance and do a terrific job with improv.  We attended with a group from Anthem Country Club and are already planning to return for the next show.  Trust me, you forget you are in a dingy Coco's and that you are faced with a mountain-sized mound of tasteless steamed broccoli on your dinner plate.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"We loved it! It was so entertaining and interactive. We never stopped laughing  and the food was delicious. I would recommend it if you love laughing and entertainment !"}
{"text":"Saw the Killer Karaoke performance on October 24 at Off the Cuff Review in Glendale.  First, this is not a good venue.  We sat facing the wall, and the tables were so close together, you could not turn around and see all of the show.  Also, the food was dreadful. Second, this is NOT family entertainment.  Particularly objectionable was the interaction between the actress playing Simone Bidet, who made inappropriate remarks to an 8 year old boy while caressing his back and shoulders.  When the audience booed in shock, it was clear the boy thought they were booing him, and he was crestfallen.  The play was also awful, and there was no mystery to it.  Had we paid full price, we would have demanded all our money back but since we had discounted tickets we just left, too disgusted to speak to anyone associated with this venture."}
{"text":"Sorry, but don't go here. Stop at a Wendy's (you will see mainly the same customers, and get much better food) and get tickets to a real play.

Seriously a truck stop atmosphere, with truck stop humor. The actors were pretty cool and very nice, but the whole experience was very disappointing.

This is a makeshift stage in a shut down half of a Cocos restaurant. Food is from Cocos also.

Also, be prepared to be a little uncomfortable, and if they \"pick\" you to be a part of the show, be prepared to be embarrassed."}
{"text":"We were a family party of nine and had a great time seeing Vampire Murder Mystery at Oregano's in Gilbert. We came in 3 different groups and arrived separately.  Within a few minutes, each group was seated and presented with a delicious caesar salad and garlic bread sticks. Much of the night's success I attribute to the details; each person was given a name tag with a short 2-sentence bio  (Al E Monie-divorce atty, Minnie Barr-saloon hostess, Wolf Howling-butcher...) About 50 guests = about 50 biographies and a lot of detail! Much appreciated =)  Other subjective food reviews: pizza was good, the pastas were fair, garlic toast excellent and the desert was awesome!
The players were all fun but I thought Madame Chimski and The Inspector were especially memorable. They both embraced an over-the-top characterization.  Players took great care to include at least one guest from every table to participate on \"stage\".  Highly interactive. Lots of laughs. Structured but impromptu as well. All attendees get a chance to question the cast of characters and solve the mystery. Anyone has the chance to get better information by bribing the characters with monopoly money provided  (more detail and again appreciated). The story is hokey but go with it.  If you're not looking for Shakespeare, then this campy show is a crowd pleaser for certain!
p.s. Cell phone videos/photos are allowed and even encouraged. NICE =)"}
{"text":"I'm a dinner theater fanatic; I go to everyone I have an opportunity to attend. While I can understand this getting fantastic reviews by people who have never attended a dinner theater, because it wasn't horrible, it was by no means anything to write home about. It was the worst I've personally attended, and I've been to some shoddy ones.
Again, it wasn't so bad that I would say don't go, but it would be way down on my list compared to say, Dinner Detective, and certainly not in the same class with Agatha's in Atlanta."}
{"text":"The cast was fantastic, scheduling was easy, and our party had tons of fun and laughed alot!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe!  I celebrated my 40th birthday here last night with 15 friends and family members for a party of 16.  

The cast was hilarious!!  They were attentive and just made the night so much fun.  I really cannot give details without giving away plot details, but we had a blast. 

We went to the same dinner theater with the same group (I think) in Phoenix when they were affiliated with a Chinese restaurant.  We had a good time then too, but Oregano's was soooo much better.

The food and service was great.  We had unlimited pasta--one with meat and one vegetarian.  Plus, there was unlimited softdrinks too.  The dessert was the traditional Oregano's cookie and icecream.  Yumm!!! 

Just thrilled with the night.  We had reservations at the Melting Pot for our group, but then I thought of this instead.  For the same price we got dinner and entertainment.  Hope to persuade the social committee at my work to plan something for the teachers to attend."}
{"text":"My sister bought us tickets for Christmas.. took us till June to use them but had we known sooner how much fun we were going to have, we would have gone right away.  We will be getting a big group together to go back but honestly we had just as much fun just the two of us as the crowd is all there to have fun and everyone was super nice."}
{"text":"Overall it's a different change of pace.  I've read a few reviews and people who complain about the food or the story are missing the point.

The show depends on audience participation.  That makes it work or not work.  We had a good crowd of willing participants and people cheered others on.  Our \"Big Daddy\" character from the audience just killed it.  There was a dance scene with 5 or 6 guests on stage and one guy just took over the dancing and was funny as hell. If your show doesn't have a few people like that then the mood probably takes a pretty big dive.  The cast seems genuinely interested in what they are doing."}
{"text":"This was a birthday celebration for one of my friends who always wanted to go to a Murder Mystery dinner show. At the end of the show, the cast called out people whoes birthday it was. Some people got individual \"nothing bunt cakes\", my friend only got a plastic cup with the production logo.

This was an ok production. Don't know if it was worth $75. Ticket was $55, fee $10, tip 15%. The meal consisted of Cesar salad, pizza, 2 different pastas, garlic bread, and personal pazookie. Our table was last to go up to the buffet line and they ran out of food. We had to wait 15 minutes for more food to be brought out. 

The actual show was ok. It was somewhat entertaining. Probably would not go back to another production."}
{"text":"This was so much more fun than I could've expected.   We went to a show at Oreganos in scottsdale.  Although my husband didn't really want to go, we both ended up having a great time and laughed so hard.  The maid - I forgot her name- but she was absolutely hilarious. Her facial expressions alone could entertain me for hours!  From the funny names assigned to each guest to the audience participation, it was great.  Absolutely loved it and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Marvelous night of farce and fun.  Cast is very good at capturing the mood of the crowd. Plot is quite silly, but complex enough to pique ones' curiosity.  Oregano's food is always good.  Not suitable for children.....but I bet they can customize a script for kids, or even a special birthday."}
{"text":"I tried to plan my office Christmas party here, I called 3 weeks ahead for a 20 person party. I had called and planned to share the venue with another party, they had said the other party has confirmed and everything was good to go so I told everyone in the office to plan for that day, few days later I get a call from someone saying they have to confirm with the other party but everything should be good. I asked why do you have to confirm when I was told everything was good to go? They responded I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page with the party and sharing the venue and other stuff like that. They said they will call me back to assure me everything was good and they didn't. Few more days pass I call them and have to leave a message and wait for them to call back. They call back and tell me the other party isn't 100% so they are going to call them again to try to get them to confirm and call me back. They never call me back unless I call and leave a message. Spoke with them today and they said we should just plan our party somewhere else and this is a few days before I was supposed to have my office party. So now I'm supposed to plan my office party in less than a week. Thanks."}
{"text":"Plan to have a great time! Seriously, this is not a show for the \"fly on the wall\" type. You can hang out and just watch, but in large, the show is about the audience! The cast does a great job of developing characters from within the audience and they do a great job of going with the flow, their improvisation is key. 

I panned this evening as for a date and we both had a blast. We found ourselves to be the most outgoing people at our table, but by the end of the night...and after a few drinks, everyone was having a great time! I cannot wait for the next show!"}
{"text":"My wife & I invited both sets of our parents to this, and the six of us had a great time.  It was entertaining and there was a lot of crowd interaction.  I won't share too much about that so as not to spoil any possible surprises, but I will say that three out of our six people were involved in the show in some way, and that was a lot of fun.  The food was pretty good too if pizza is your thing (pizza IS my thing), and you can't go wrong with Oregano's.  Plus, they even gave everyone a small individual version of their cookie dessert, which my wife was especially happy about.  All in all, it was a fun night out."}
{"text":"What a BLAST!! I have gone to see one show twice and one show once. It is such a great time. The cast is so much fun and interactive!! I have gone to Murder Mystery Shows since I was a young kid. This cast gives you a top notch and on point performance. This last time, I took my Mother, Mamma Rosie, to the show! The first Murder Mystery Show I ever saw when I was a kid was with her! That being said she had the BEST time, so did my partner and myself. Both the cast and crew are caring and attentive to making sure that you have the best time! I've seen the show at both Oregano's locations and prefer the Old Town Scottsdale location, but I am excited to try out the new venue Coup Des Tartes! My only wish is that they had their own venue and did more performances and shows, but I get it from a business end! A guy can wish!!! They even gave us a special surprise for our celebration!!!"}
{"text":"Very fun! The actors are genuine, and do a wonderful job of interacting with the audience. It's pretty cheesy, but you will still get some very good laughs. Unfortunately my party arrived a little late and we missed out on getting assigned a name and role. You definitely need to let your guard down and be able to laugh at yourself, they WILL bring you on stage and interact with you in very embarrassing ways, just have fun! The food is decent; chicken was dry and for a 3 course meal it is pretty light, but it is not terrible - pretty much what you would expect for catered food. 

HOWEVER, one big comment is that (possibly part owner) Tim, Englishman who answers the phone and is involved in payment, is very rude and needs a lesson in customer service. When I first called and reserved the table for 4 he asks for a credit card to reserve the table - this is pretty standard and we expected this. However when we got there he tried to have me put in all on the card, I had to explain several times that I did not want this. I also had a member of the party get food poisoning the day of the event and Tim said they had a 24 hour cancellation policy even though I told him 12 hours in advance that we would only be having three members. However the 24 hour cancellation policy isn't mentioned ANYWHERE, not on their website, and was not told when I first gave the card. This needs to be given. When I explained the situation he was rather rude and said \"the food was prepared before the show,\" however I know this to be a lie. The event was only at 70% capacity, it wouldn't have any effect on them if they lost a single ticket. We ended up paying for 3, but it was a huge hassle.

However I would go again, it was a unique night out!"}
{"text":"This show was so much fun! Definitely a different kind of evening out the food was delicious the cast was very funny and made us feel involved in the show. Would highly recommend and want to come back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently went to this show and saw \"Murder at the Vampire's Wedding.\" Although we felt the cast tried to make it fun, we really were not impressed. The actors often came out of character and when they were in character the show was very hokey and pretty lame. They tried to get the crowd involved but it came across as them trying too hard and most people did not seem very impressed - most acted involved to avoid being called out and made to do something even more ridiculous. Additionally, the food was really bad (we went to Cocos). We were counting the minutes until we could leave and will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"This was a fun night out with my husband and a couple of friends. 
They do family style dining for the show. Our show was at Oregano's in Scottsdale; the food was so-so; Cesar salad (very good), followed by a buffet meal (all pasta; one meat and one veggie) that was lacking I thought... it was good but I think for the price we paid they could have served a chicken parm./meatballs or something like that (it needed more protein) and followed by a cookie and ice cream dessert (yum). Even if you think of the price as 1/2 for the food and 1/2 for the show; it's on the pricey side.
The actors and actresses (5-6 of them) did a great job at keeping the room entertained. They had some audience members participate here and there too; the room held about 50 people. The show is stupid funny with over-acting, missed music queue's and some jokes clearly geared to the adults. If you don't appreciate stupid comedy and audience participation; this is not a show for you. Our table included a 16 year old and a 10 year old; the 16 year old seemed entertained... the kid just sort of looked confused for the show so perhaps 15+ is a better age for the show.
I would go again; I have a few friends that I think would just love this event so I plan to take them some time soon."}
{"text":"Had a great time.  Was really campy and silly. The cast was quite funny. Go prepared to just cut loose, don't take it or yourself too seriously and just enjoy (a drink or two helps as well). The whole thing was fun and funny."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Murder at Greystone Manor at Oregano's at Scottsdale & Shea.  It was a lively (rowdy?), fun, and funny evening.  The actors were enthusiastic and did a good job.  Dinner was a Caesar salad, pasta and pizza buffet, and a small brownie sundae for dessert.  It was OK but nothing to write home about.  Sodas and beer were also available.  

While there was a murder mystery aspect to the evening, I would say it was more a collection of semi-naughty routines and horsing around, some of which included \"volunteers\" from the audience.  While it was all fun, I would recommend leaving the kids at home, unless they are at least teenagers."}
{"text":"Not your typical dinner show...this one had more engagement and participation from the audience than I've ever experienced from a murder mystery dinner!  The food left something to be desired, but let's be honest, that's not why you go to these shoes (plus, it wasn't all that bad).  The actors served the dinner, and really made it a fun time.  But word of advice, if you get embarrassed easily, or don't like to participate in shows, this may not be the one for you...although they have a full bar so you may just need a drink or two to feel more comfortable and enjoy the show...it's worth it ;)"}
{"text":"Held on Halloween at Oreganos in Scottsdale. We had a wonderful time and our entire table was dressed in costume! The only complaint is that for the money we spent the food at Oreganos was just adequate. Salad was tasty, two kinds of pasta but NO meat and lots of bread if that is what you want to fill up on! The cast was fun and very entertaining. But was very disappointed with the food.  If the food was good I would have given a 5. Considering the food the evening was overpriced! Sorry Mystery Mansion you were great not the food!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my family to a show at Oreganos in Scottsdale, I had been to one before at the CoCo's location.  Both times the show was very interactive and so much fun!  Everyone enjoyed themselves.  Unfortunately the food at Oreganos was not up to the price point we paid, Cesar salad, pasta and pizza (most with only peppers and some had meat on them)  The food was much much better at the CoCo's location show and well worth the price you paid per person.  I would definitely go again but not to an Oreganos location."}
{"text":"We went for my mother in-law's birthday. We laughed from beginning to end. I was lucky enough to get a major audience role which made it all that much more fun. We saw the Murder at the Vampire's Wedding show. Nelly Mae was perfectly cast and did a great job. Madame Chinski the Gypsy was very funny and kept us in stitches. Loved the inspector too. The whole cast was great. We are already looking into going back for a different show. The food was good but not great. it was worth every cent. I would highly recommend this show to any audience!"}
{"text":"I will start my review by saying these shows aren't going to be for everyone. I took my sister here for her birthday and were seated at one of the tables in front of the stage. I felt like we were at a bingo hall, as the average age of the audience had to be at least 65+. We saw \"Murder at Greystone Manor\", which was very cheesy, the costumes and makeup are horrendous, the food was really mediocre but it was pretty entertaining! My sister was asked at one point to go up and dance!!! Great pictures! If you're not someone who's open to being \"picked\" on or being exposed to some mildly inappropriate comments/suggestions, I would not recommend this show. The murder part of this show was also lacking- the other parts of the storyline were focused on more than the actual murder. It was fun to receive an \"identity\" and get to solve the mystery.

For $45/person, I think my sister and I had a great time and got to cross something off our bucket list. However, I highly doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time to a interactive theatre event and it was a blast.  We have been to may theatre shows but to be so close and intimate with the actors was truly a great experience.  Our night had a great audience who were all into the event.  We all had upgraded food items and were good for a chain restaurant like coco's and added pleasantly to our experience.  We cannot wait to go again and will be inviting many more friends to join us."}
{"text":"Pretty entertaining, but as other people have mentioned, it's super corny. The director/owner of the production seemed very nice and helpful. My friend enjoyed the show a little bit more than me, but she's into that sort of thing. We were disappointed by the conclusion, it seemed a bit \"unsophisticated\". I know that sounds a little obnoxious, but it's true. 

The vegetarian food though, was lackluster---if I based the review on that alone, I'd give this place one star. I could only take a bite or two of the veggie burger, and I was done. The drinks were weak---my friends tried two of the \"special\" mixed drinks, and did not like them. The \"Tipsy Gypsy\" was okay. Be prepared to join in on the show."}
{"text":"I took a friend for his birthday and we had a blast. The characters were very interactive with the guests and made sure that everyone participated. 
The food was alright. It was edible but nothing to brag about. 
The price was a little high but well worth it for the entertainment!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night and it was a fantastic time. We laughed throughout. The actors were very talented and they interacted with the crowd often. The food is made at Coco's diner so know that going in. It was good food. Basic ranch salad. Choice of entree. Angel food cake with strawberries and whipped cream. Service was above average. All in all it was a fantastic night. I would recommend this for a group or even a couple. You will get to know everyone at your table. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday. The food was ok (chain restaurant), but the show was very entertaining. The ending really is a twist and the young lady who plays the female lead is gorgeous. It really was an entertaining show."}
{"text":"This is wonderfully fun murder mystery dinner theater.  
We stepped into a different world that night, as we spied many interesting characters such as C.D. Weasel, the director of the debuting silent film, host to all of the guests at his new mansion. Clara Simpleton, the sweet and demure girl next door. Edward Manly III, the swashbuckling lady killer.  Fanny Fanciful, the wild flapper, and Jewel Precious, transvestite personal assistant to famous silent film star, Louise Loveless.  
 
This was interactive, so my date and i were given our own personal names and identities.  I was Demi Tasse, short film star, and my date was Jason Rainbows, songwriter.  essentially, all the people in the \"audience\", the guests, represented roles of people involved in the making of the silent film, directed by c.d. weasel, which would be debuting at the manor.  it would take me days to relate all of the cookiness that went on that night, but i will say that these were the craziest bunch of people i have ever met. no holds barred, they especially enjoyed using the \"guests\" for their own personal jokes.  at one point in the evening, there was a dancing contest, and half of the dancers were elderly men...some of the music selections were as follows: \"i'm too sexy\" and \"stayin' alive.\" 
 
Jewel Precious continually sauntered over to the table, to press her behemoth bosom into my date's face.  I have never heard so many puns and innuendos...in a two hour period.  
the cast was so vivid, and we witnessed murder, cat fights, love scenes, spanking, and a gun fight.  of course, the action sequences were what one would expect from a troupe that relies more on personal wit, and flair for drama.
 
the \"5-course\" meal consisted of a small cup of soup, a barren salad consisting of lettuce and a couple olives, chicken breast, rice, and a chocolate mousse for dessert.  it was alright. don't know if i would count that as a five course, as there were only four \"courses\" anyway.  sometimes, words are not enough spice to make a bad meal taste good.
 
we had some great laughs, and were quite inebriated by the time we were through.  you have to get drunk to be a part of something like this. otherwise, you might wet your knickers from embarassment.  they will pull you up on their little stage, infront of everyone, and will make you do all sorts of silly and embarassing things...
 
i strongly suggest you  go to the site just to take a peek at the characters of the show. especially, jewel precious. he/she was my favorite in the show. :)"}
{"text":"We had a party of 16 and we all had such a great time! The cast was funny and so great getting the crowd involved. The only thing I have to complain about was the food. I looove oreganos, but buffet style it just wasn't that good :/ salad was mushy and there was no choices of meat for the pasta. But, I would still go again!"}
{"text":"I think the cast does a great job and they're funny, esp the maid and the villian lady. The food is nothing to brag home about, but you're really paying for entertainment. Also the plot or set up isn't elaborate-low budget, so it really depends on audience participation and the over-the-top performances that make it good. I think this is how most mystery dinner theatres are, I guess I was picturing something more elaborate like an actual mansion set up-that would be really fun. Yes like someone else mentioned there are extra costs beside ticket costs-just tips for the cast like $10 and tips for the server $5, so its a lil pricy for what u get with the ticket costs. It's more geared towards an older  people crowd and so it might not have been the best choice for my 30 year old fiance birthday-but he still liked it. Hard to impress him tho after going to see Vegas shows a month or so ago. Fun idea for an evening to do something different if you can afford it."}
{"text":"The first time I ever went to a dinner theater event was in Las Vegas and it was great. But, that is Vegas.  
While looking for things to do on our recent trip to Phoenix, I found this Mystery Dinner theater, Murder at Greystone Manor.  We didn't really know what to expect.  There was no information on the website on what the \"Dinner\" was to be other than it was 3 courses. Well, the program is held in the back of a pizza parlor. Any guesses as to what the meal was????  If you guessed pizza you would be correct.  It also came with a salad. The pizza and pasta were served buffet style, which was ok, not great, but ok. Then for desert we were served ice cream over a warm chocolate cookie. That was a good combination. 
The show itself is very funny, the cast is awesome and you can tell they like what they do.  This nite there was good audience participation (which really makes show). 
All in all this was a great evening out with family. We all had a great time. Would do this again but go for another show. There are several around town.  Sooooo much fun"}
{"text":"Dramatic improvements!!!  They moved to a new location in downtown Phoenix and the food is SO MUCH BETTER!  The first dinner course consisted of a salad with tomatoes and balsamic vinaigrette, the second course is your choice from four entrees (salmon, bone in chicken, beef sirloin, or penne pasta with lots of veggies), dessert was a warm apple crisp.  Dinner is included with the $45 dinner-and-a-show, but beverages are a separate tab.  The wine menu was sparse, but come-on, the real reason you are there is for the entertainment.

We took our daughter for her 14th birthday and it was a lot of fun.  They said the show was PG-13, so I was a little worried.  It was perfect though; she had a blast and so did we!  The actors interact with the audience and you really feel like a part of the show.  It was very funny, and the acting was surprisingly good!  I haven't seen my mom laugh so hard in years!  :o)  The whole family had fun and we look forward to returning to see one of the other shows that they offer.  http://www.MysteryMansion.com/"}
{"text":"My husband and I attended a dinner show last night. We had such a fun time!!! The people at we met were great. The show it self was fun and we laughed all night. Totally worth the $. It was sort of an interactive murder mystery show. I wasn't sure if my husband would like it, but he loved it and we plan to attend one of their other show........Go to one....It was really fun:)

$39 that included the chicken dinner, salad and cake. Coffee and water at the tables. Drinks $2 and I think their was drink specials for $6.......There is a bar right in the room."}
{"text":"Amazing cast and show!! I highly recommend it to everyone that wants to enjoy a nice dinner and have a great laugh!! They kept all the guests engaged in some way or another and eveyrone was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"We went to the theater last night at the Oreganos in North Scottsdale. It was MISERABLY hot! That's all I can say about it. I couldn't enjoy the show or follow the story line or really even want to eat. I just wanted out of there. So disappointing."}
{"text":"took my mom for her birthday, we had so much fun, the cast is so friendly and great"}
{"text":"We had the best time! The show was hilarious and the food was delicious and the cast is awesome! We went for my moms birthday and everyone had a blast! I would highly recommend this show and I will be going to see another one! It was lots of fun and it was something different!!"}
{"text":"Hello all you followers out there......

This review is a long time coming... 

We have been to mystery manion 4 times and each time it is simply FABULOUS!

Starting when you walk in and meet Kim who is super friendly and has a nice smile.

They moved the stage to the center of the room which was a nice change since we were last there.

The charachters in the show begin to greet you immediately and schmooze with you and you are not there 5 minutes before you are in stiches!

There were 4 of us and another couple were seated with us and it was fun meeting new people.  We were all there for the same reason and that was to laugh.

This show was \"VAMPIRES WEDDING\" and as in every show I have gone to see the star actor in my opinion is always the same... I apologize because I do not know his name but in this show he is the \"gypsy\".

He is amazingly hilarious and I enjoy everything about him!

However I have to give thumbs up to the entire cast as each one did a FANTASTIC job of entertaining us.

I was surprised that tonights performance had a very small audience but we found it an almost \"intimate\" evening.

By the time the show was over we all knew something about one another and people were milling around talking to eachother and taking pictures.

The bar staff was also wonderful...thank you Phoebe!

So now we know the show was fantastic but there is one thing they must do something about...and that is the food.  

This place is connected to CoCo's restaurant...need I say more?

I realize we pay $41.50 for the show but I do feel they should get rid of the food or bring in Mcdonalds or something...anything would be better than that food...and we thought the old location in the chinese restaurant was bad!

Or do away with the food altogether and drop the price $10.00.

Anyway....I am giving 4 stars and for me that puts this place in \"elite\" category..

Get rid of the food or make a drastic change for the better and I will give you the 5 stars you so deserve!

So, for now.... live each day as though it were you last and ENJOY!"}

{"text":"We went to see Murder at Greystone Manor at the Oregano's in central Scottsdale.  We recently saw a different mystery in Gilbert a month or so ago and we had family coming to visit us so we decided to take them.  The five of us sat with four other people at our table. The show was really funny. It is a little bit cheesy - but that's really part of the charm of it. The facial,expressions from Louise Lovelace and Jewel Precious are great - it's entertaining just watching that. Jewel - we love you!! 

The food was good. It was Caesar salad followed by two pastas - Alfredo the dark and big rig pasta plus garlic bread and pizza. I love food at Oregano's so I thought it was good. Thr service from the mystery staff as well as Colby were very good - Colby definitely kept the drinks coming. 

I would definitely do this again - of course with a different show. It's a lot of laughs."}
{"text":"I went to the Mystery Mansion Dinner for my birthday. The theme was Murder at the Vampires Wedding. I was not sure what to expect as I have never been to a murder mystery dinner before, but I do have to say I was pleasantly surprised and had the best time. This was a birthday dinner I will never forget!  The food was great, the actors were fabulously funny and very entertaining. I had such a great time, I am already planning to go again."}
