{"text":"Awesome place, I've had better Italian, but the atmosphere and service truly make up for it. Go check it out, if I'm ever back to Scottsdale I'll most likely be back and try other dishes. Sax player was awesome."}
{"text":"WOW!  If you want to be treated terrible, yelled at, and spit on by the wait staff and owner this is the place to go.  I can elaborate on the spitting part - while the owner Gary was yelling drunk he spit while he talked....  I was excited to to this place after all the yelp reviews, but unfortunately was completely disappointed.  Its amazing they are even in business with the way they treat their customers!"}
{"text":"It's alright, I felt the food wasn't as authentic as some of the other italian restraints I've eaten at, however it's not horrible.Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Phenominal old school authentic Italian.  You will love the red sauce here.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"italian grotto is special. music from the rat pack put us in a good mood. the low light, private booth, and fine art made us feel comfortable. the good food made us feel happy and full. I  had the cannelloni florentine. my excellent wife had the veal parm.  both of our meals were served hot, which we really appreciate.  her salad and wine were good, and her blue cheese dressing was terrific. my minestrone soup was good. we split an order of garlic toast. marinara dipping sauce was a nice touch.  we went early, so that we could have some quiet time. italian grotto has high energy and full tables later in the day/evening.  peter took very good care of us."}
{"text":"this is possibly the worst restaurant I have ever been in. should have been clued in when at lunch time no other patrons were in there. we had 8 people and 3 of them ordered the chicken Ceasar salads. the salad had a horrible fish smell and tasted even worst. they put hard dry piece of chicken on top of lettuce that was soaked in fish sauce. we've all had many Ceasars salads in our life made with anchovies and I'm sorry it does not end up tasting like dead fish. the owner was rude and had attitude when we said none of the 3 could eat the salads. there was no one in the restaurant and 5 employees walking around but no one could bother checking on our table for drinks or even offer us a dessert menu. the owner didn't take any of the salads off the bill never told us the bill included a inflated tip and as we counted our money to pay the tab he had the nerve to say you can leave more!! in the 5 years I've been on this site this is only the 2nd place I've ever left a negative review, ever. that should tell you how bad it was."}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude waiter named Terrance.  My son and I walked in and sat down at a six top, waiting for four more to join us.  It was our first time ever going,  he walked by us three times before coming over to us.  He pitched the menu's on our table and asked what we wanted to drink.  I had been excited about getting a real espresso before lunch and told him we had never been here before and asked if they had a drink menu.  He rattled of \"full bar, coke products and water\".  I asked If they had any types of coffees,  and he said \"yeah I can get you a coffee,  or an espresso\" .. Well If you have espresso then you can make cappuccino right?  I asked for one of them,  some water and a Dr Pepper for my son.  He brought back the drinks with no water, and then got irritated when I asked for water!  He walked off,  didn't at all ask if we wanted bread while we looked at the menu.  I had to flag another waiter down, in order to get our waiters attention, rudely he said what else can I get you?  I had  a 20.00 out and said a to go cup and the change for our drinks. He said sorry we don't have to go cups,  took my money came back and laid change on the table,  no receipt, and walked away.  So then I had to ask ANOTHER waited for a receipt.  The same dude walks up and writes on a piece of paper 5+3=8, shoves it towards me and walks off again. Called the folks meeting me and said we are meeting somewhere else,  this place is a dive!!  Pausing to write this review before we find another place.  6 people X  35.00 average plate X minimum 20% minimum tip..  It would be interesting to see the owners profit..  Or lack of it.  Said one Bears fan in Scottsdale.."}
{"text":"The owner is a complete jerk and a drunk. I hope no one will continue to support this behavior!!! I will never visit this place again! He made some comments about his ex wives and how he doesn't care because he had been successful for 30 years at this restaurant. The servers are very unfriendly. The food was good but absolutely not worth the way we were treated. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow!  From the moment I heard the Sinatra music on the sidewalk to the last smell of marinara sauce in the air as I left the building, this place exceeded any expectation.  This place smelled, breathed, sounded and tasted of something you would expect in 70's Chicago or New York.  My buddy and I were in town for Spring Training and both agreed that this was the best spot to which we had been in 10 or so years making the annual trip.  He is a martini drinker and was blown away by the taste and abundance.  I had two glassed of fantastic Pinot.  We split a plate of manicotti as an appetizer (based on the recommendation of a long-time customer that was sitting at the bar while we were waiting for a table) and then each had the veal parmesan (outstanding).  I just wish I had saved some room for dessert."}
{"text":"My friend & I were in town for a couple nights so we decided to check out Scottsdale.  We were walking around looking for someplace to have dinner and came across Italian Grotto.  I read previous reviews & wasn't too sure how great our experience would be here, but decided to give this restaurant a try.  The staff here were awesome!  We got seated right away & service was top notch!  We immediately got served & all our drinks & food came out in a very timely manner.   We started out with a bottle of malbec wine for only $34, which we really enjoyed. Our waiter, Terrance was the excellent!  He recommended one of the specials which was a seafood medley of fish, calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels, & scallops in a cream sauce over linguine pasta.  I also had their soup of the day, homemade minestrone, which came with my meal.  Both were very good!  My friend had the clam rapallo: clams simmered in seafood stock, fresh garlic, herbs and white wine served over pasta. She had their house salad that also came with her meal.  She really enjoyed her meal as well.  The food was great, portion sizes generous, reasonable prices, nice ambience, friendly  & prompt service from all the staff!!! 3.5-4 stars on food quality, 5 stars for making our dining experience in Scottsdale memorable & great!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service and food I've ever had! And I have never complained about a restaurant! Anyone who thinks this kind of service & food is even passable is nuts!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here during our annual spring training trip, and the food was... OK. One plate of pasta was overcooked, another undercooked, a side of sausage arrived at the table as a complete link rather than sliced - but what really was disappointing was the restroom. The men's restroom was disgusting! It was absolutely filthy, the urinal didn't flush, the entire room needed a good bleaching. How does this place pass a Health Department inspection? I sure hope they put a more concerted effort into cleaning the kitchen. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience! We had just come from a wine tasting and viewing several art galleries  Hungry, so we wanted to have dinner. We got right in asked for a gluten free menu. We were asked what we wanted to drink just as we sat down and we said waters for now. The owner then replied that he was not going to serve us and asked us to leave. He said he did not have to explain why  Then, for lack of better terms a Guido kind of guy said we had to leave  This was one of the most bizarre experiences we have ever encountered.  Then, just after us a couple asked if there was room at the bar and he said \"Does it look like it!? We were shocked and angry as any one would be. I cannot tell you if the food had any merit  but the treatment was inexcusable."}
{"text":"Horrible & the rudest person (owner) seating & answering phone asked if reservation was needed and hung up the phone & when arrived he was so rude, the restaurant was highly recommended by local folks, I will never go back due to the rudest person I have ever encountered in my dining experience. So unprofessional for a restaurant owner."}
{"text":"The manager or owner was rude to our group of six and insulted me personally.  We asked if there would be an outside table for six.  We saw that there was a party finishing up their meal.  His response was this: \"Do you see any tables open for six? You need to be visual.  It doesn't take any intelligence at all to be visual\"  I responded that he didn't obviously need our business and his response was, \"Go annoy someone else.\"  As we moved on to another place he moved over to an outside ashtray, picked up a half-smiked cigarette and lit it up. How this place stays open with this ignorant character as the face of the business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Food is very above average. Service is garbage. Waiter didn't tell us specials, barely paid attention to us. Left an extra bread basket on our table, my boyfriend put his hand on it to see if was hot, the waiter saw it, but realized they bread wasn't for us and put the same bread on a neighboring table! Gross. On top of that, they are thieves. We were so upset with our service, we did not leave a tip on our $ 43 bill, it got charged to the credit card as $ 54!! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"What can I say....It's kinda one of those places you either \"get\" or you don't.....I get the employees...They aren't stuffy...they aren't fancy....It's an Italian \"hang-out\" if you will......To me, they make you feel like your family.  I love the food, especially any seafood special they can cook up!  The minestrone soup doesn't look like much, but OMG...it's good!  My hubby had veal the other night, and it was good....to much breading for my taste, but it was still really good.  All in all.....Can't wait to go back....Hope to see ya soon Italian Grotto boys! Carol  Old School Chico Ca."}
{"text":"Arrogant is to nice a word to describe the waiter called Meatball (Brandon ) Meathead would be the correct name for this guy . Rude and unprofessional , food actually was very good but the server was not . Great location , need to get some waiters that actually care if you return or not ."}
{"text":"A very rude and vulgar host.  It was taking a few minutes to get around some people to seat six at a table/booth.  He started pushing the table and swearing including the F word. Very poor individual to represent a business. He wnded by yelling for us to get the F out."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! What seems to be the owner is a very mean man! If you want to enjoy yourself here and good luck. He yells at the staff. And he even yelled at three little old ladies, this man should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"Worst Italian place ever.  - waiters were rude and didn't want to even accommodate us adding a chair to our table  - salads were old and even had some leafs that were rotten - the bread was old and hard  - my wife's fettuccini Alfredo tasted like a combination of cardboard and nothing and was completely cold. After the treatment when we got into the restaurant though we did not send the food back out of fear they would spit into it  - then the waiter filled up our sparkling waters with plain water - oh well there goes that taste.  - the plates had chips ...  It was like almost never ending.   I had been eating here once like 12 years ago and I guess now I remember why we never came back.   This time I will remember."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.    Absolute SH&T hole!  Tourist only like it because they're intoxicated enough to destroy taste buds.  I tried it again just to be sure, and now I'm certain that this place is about the worst italian food you can get in Old Town.  Olive G is better (that's how bad this place is).  Everything tastes like it was frozen like a tv dinner and just heated up to serve.  Service is super slow."}
{"text":"The staff was so rude to us. We came in to grab a drink, look over the menu, and use the restroom. They told us \"we don't want to play that game\" and told us not to sit down. Horribly rude and unprofessional. I've never had anyone be so disrespectful at a restaurant to me. Look elsewhere for food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Last night we dined here for the first and last times. Our party of 8 was greeted at the door by a rude owner who told us we had to finish our meal in an hour because he had another group coming in and needed our table. At this point we should have left but We sat down and ordered our appetizers. Our order of zucchini and calamari was a disgrace. The portions was so small and the price of 9.00 was outrageous. The special of seafood fettuccine should have been called soup. Sauce was watery and missing most of the seafood. Not sure how this place is still in business with all the truly fine restaurants in Scottsdale. If you are looking for a good Italian me sal stay away from this place since it is overpriced and the food is totally lacking flavor and quality."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  From the fork that had crusted, hardened on food from the last customer, to the horrible waiter that didn't think the dirty fork was any big deal, to the obvious ravioli straight from the freezer aisle of any grocery store, to the overall dirtiness of the whole place.  It's funny that they ask if you want  \"fresh\" parmesan but don't grate it in front of you!   I am so angry that we just spent a ton of money on absolute crap!  I would not recommend this to anyone!  I would give it 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for a late afternoon drink and snacks (3:30pm).    The outdoor seating area had one other couple and no one waiting...in fact the place was pretty empty inside and out. When asked if we could sit outside the waiter rudely replied: \"Only if you eat\"  We said we would have some drinks and appetizers.   When he came back, after we seated ourselves, I asked for a drink menu. Again, with the rude response: \"We have 175 drinks...\", and then he walked away.   After after a moment, we decided to spend out time, and our money, at an establishment that appreciates customers a bit more."}
{"text":"Owner is an arrogant prick!!! Don't care if the food is good or not, but there are too many good restaurants in old town to give this guy your hard earned $$$$"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Portions were small.  Not the cleanest retaurant I've ever been in."}
{"text":"I ordered the $25 shrimp scampi and my husband ordered a $26 seafood dish that had a mix of mussels and shrimp, etc. Neither of the dishes were good. My husband said that some of the muscles tasted very weird. There were only 4 shrimp in my dish. For $25 I would think they would serve more than 4 shrimp. The flavor was very strong and not good at all. They seated us at a table that had crumbs all over the table cloth, obviously not cleaned up since the previous customers. The atmosphere was dark and dank. The music they played was 60's which is fine but in an Italian restaurant I would think they would play something better suited. The decor was awful. Overall, I'd say the place was a dump and the food was not good. Especially not worth the price. The only real plus was that our waitress was attentive. I won't ever eat there again and wouldn't recommend this restaurant. The food is much better at an Olive Garden and cheaper."}
{"text":"Think soup Nazi for Italian food.  You either love it or you hate it.  I think their modus operandi is to size up a table and treat you with an attitude.  If you have thick skin, will open your wallet, and are \"real\" to them, they'll treat you like family; if not, they'll kick you out, as they did to a young couple next to us.  I chose the Chilean sea bass with Ravioli and it was incredible.  Our waiter took shots with our table and our service and food were great.  It's a dining experience I recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now and loved it both times.  They don't make you feel terribly welcome. Getting seated both times was a little awkward.  The waiters both times were really good (attentive) but a little standoffish.  The food has been excellent though.  I took the waiter's recommendation of the veal carolina and it was super!  We will definitely go back and even will look forward a little to the pseudo feeling of being an intruder.  Oddly, combined with how good the food is, it is quite charming."}
{"text":"the owner is a gay hating jerk. my friend and I were chased out. he screamed \"get out you sick fucking faggots\" all the way to my car. they kept my wallet (which had approx 400 cash, c/c's and  my ID w/address). police came but were not allowed in.    about three weeks later my place was broken into."}
{"text":"Bar rescue needs to come here. Staff is unprofessional. Food is decent, but expensive."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food at best. Garlic bread seemed to be days old judging how hard it was, pasta was poorly cooked and salad was drowned in a half bowl if vinegar. Nothing seemed fresh made had better frozen dinners from the supermarket!. If the owner spent less time strutting his stuff and more time making sure the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen was better it would have been a far better meal. Won't be caught again will never dine there nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we ordered a beer each and some calamari to hold us over until the Cal game started. The gal behind the bar was somewhat \"rude\" to begin with (maybe she had a bad day?). We then ordered salad and pasta for dinner with wine. She was \"perturbed\" that we were planning to share the order rather than order an entree each. The game finally started and fans for both teams were rooting/screaming as usual and the owner came over to me and told me I was \"too loud\"---even though everyone else was cheering all the same. We even bought a beer for the guy sitting next to us (who was betting on Louisville). She wrote up our bill even though we weren't finished with the meal (nor possible ordering of dessert, etc.) and told us to leave. When we asked her why she said we had been there long enough. (???) She even threatened to black out all of the TV's (there were about half a dozen). We were absolutely dumbfounded. This is the kicker: we have frequented The Grotto for the past 4 years during spring training, tip well, and considered ourselves \"regulars\" (we became acquainted with everyone that worked there including the owner) but this gal behind the bar was new to us. Who knows the real reason--we are still scratching our heads! However, we will no longer patronize such rude service.  As 4 year patrons, we are no longer supporting their establishment.   We've been discovering how Scottsdale has been booming with new eateries----from excellent sports bars with great food, service , wine menu and draft beer selections to nice linen tablecloth dining experiences.  We certainly don't need to be insulted by those at The ?Grotto anymore."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life. I've been using Yelp to find new places to eat around Phoenix for the last few weeks, and until now the reviews have been pretty accurate. Not so with this place, our evening turned into the kind of nightmare that I've read about in a few reviews and thought that they were just too bad to be real.. well, this one is real!  As some of the other reviewers indicated, the staff is not friendly at all. I can look past that for good food, so long as they're not downright rude. My girlfriend is gluten intolerant, and we explained to the waiter that she can't have either pasta or breading, so she ordered the only chicken dish on the menu that didn't have any breading; I ordered the cannelloni.  Our food arrived, and her dish was completely wrong - it was a big pasta dish with vegetables on top, and no chicken. We called the waiter over, told him that the order was wrong, and grabbed it angrily and walked away, not even apologizing. A few minutes later, a dish with just chicken on it was placed in front of my girlfriend, with nothing else. She cut a piece of the chicken, and immediately tasted breading (and furthermore, she said that the chick was VERY tough). I tried my cannelloni, and it was downright disgusting - cheap pre-made crepe, and the meat was dry.  The waiter then re-appeared with the vegetables that were previously atop the pasta, scattered about onto a plate, and he told us that he pulled \"most\" of the pasta out.  We called the waiter back over and explained that our dining experience has been a disaster here, and we were going to go elsewhere, and offered to pay for the soup and salad which we got before the meal. He angrily grabs the plates and hurries off, then comes back with a piece of paper with '11' scribbled across it. When I told him that I thought that was a ridiculous price to pay for a tiny soup and salad, after the experience we had just had, he snaps back, \"You have two choices - either pay the $11, or we call the cops and haul your ass out\". I asked to speak to the manager, who was just as rude.   I paid the $11 and told them that no friends of mine would ever dine at that restaurant. I would highly discourage anyone, friend or not, to ever step foot in that place again. Worst. Restaurant. Ever."}
{"text":"I gave it 1 star because there isn't a zero star. The rudest people and they are proud of it. Go there if you are looking for abuse with microwave quality food in a place that is so loud there is no way to talk to the people at your table without shouting as loud as you can. Save your money and time and get a microwave box of Italian food and stay home and I guarantee you will have a better meal and more fun.  This place is aweful!!"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you like to have conversations with your friends during dinner. Don't go if you don't like paying fairly high prices for hit and miss food. And do NOT go here if you want friendly service. The service either ends up great, or crap. And to be honest I think the people who work there take thier attitudes from the owner. He just gets ruder and more arrogant (and more drug addled) as the years go by, won't be comming here... EVER again."}
{"text":"While walking around Old Town Scottsdale we came across this place and it looked interesting.  The gentleman at the front door boasted that the place has been at this location for over 40 years.  So we decided to have dinner here.    The waiter was nice, not friendly (and that is okay with me, I am not taking him home, so I like that he was not trying to be over friendly.)  He asked us if we wanted appetizers and we said no, because when we eat appetizers we never finish our dinner.  After we placed our dinner order he asked us if we would like garlic bread, either plain or with tomatoes & cheese on it and we replied \"yes the tomatoes & cheese sounded good.\"  The bread was soggy and I could tell the marinara sauce was from a can, it had a YUCKY metallic after taste.  A different person served us our dinner.  He was very pleasant but he was wearing a light gray polo shirt that full of stains all over the front. (I noticed this immediately because we were sitting next to the window and it was 5:00 so the sun was shining bright into the restaurant.)  This totally turned my stomach to see how dirty his shirt was.  Wearing a filthy shirt while serving food is completely unacceptable, especially when serving food in a \"fancy\" overpriced restaurant.  The least management can do for their employees is to supply them with clean shirts.  Our dinner was okay, not the best we have ever had but we were okay with the taste of the food.  When we received our bill there was an extra charge of $8.00 on it.  When I asked the waiter what it was for he said it was for the garlic bread.  I told him that the way he presented it to us, he made it seem as if the bread came with the dinner.  His response was \"Well I said \"if you want you can have...\"  That was wrong on so many levels, he was purposely upselling his food.  THAT makes me angry, you should never trick your customers into buying food they don't want.  Why trick your customers?????  I posted on FB that we were trying a new restaurant so several people asked me how it was.  Apparently this place has a bad reputation.  There were 2 people at my office that said they too had a similar negative experience at this place.  I am pretty sure all the positive reviews here are NOT legitimate reviews.   Also, when we were leaving we noticed the person who was at the front door when we initially found this past (who we believe to be the owner) was YELLING at the person who was working at the store next to him.  That was so unprofessional.  I will NEVER go back. Our advice is to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"3 stars.  TL;DR: pros for good Italian fare, friendly ambiance; cons for selling too hard, and check your bill for miscalculations.  Meal: 4 stars - (appetizers) Caesar salad; fried calamari - (entree) scallop oreganata - (daily special) Chilean sea bass  Ambiance and service: 3.5 stars - funny, smooth-talking waiter - sports bar: dim but friendly, buzzing with chatter; lots of bobble heads  Bill miscalculation: 1 stars  Came here with my family late on a weekday evening. I wasn't hungry, so I ordered an appetizer salad ($8). Waiter asked if I wanted to add grilled chicken -- I figured it was $2 or $3 more, so I said yes. Waiter offered garlic bread, to which we declined, but he said he would \"throw it in anyway.\"  The food came in good time and was a solid, Italian meal. Chilean sea bass was tender -- delicious! Fried calamari is fried calamari, but very good. The good-humored waiter came by often to check on us, cracking jokes and whisking away plates.  When the bill came, we noticed a $30+ overcharge! - My $8 Caesar salad turned into a $20 entree: the waiter said \"All our chicken orders are $20.\" A fair waiter should have notified me if adding grilled chicken on a salad is more than a couple of dollars -- especially if there is no \"grilled chicken Caesar salad\" entree on the menu. - The garlic bread that was \"thrown in anyway\" was suddenly an extra $6. - Even given these prices, the total was an additional $17 over -- a pure miscalculation.  We notified the waiter and had everything fixed (except for the salad... oh well). Overall, it was $30/person with the correction -- on the pricey side. Ended on a sour note, but had good portions and friendly staff... I would return, but with a greater wariness for the bill."}
{"text":"Update: After leaving my recent review I decided to read the reviews of others and I am appalled by reports of the owner's actions and discrimination. It appears that the owner, Garry, now owns the new EAT West of Brown (old Cider Mill) near the Italian Grotto (http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Asset59708.aspx). I would strongly recommend avoiding this establishment if you, like me, do not condone this type of belligerent behavior.  I created a Yelp account specifically to write this review to warn others not to eat at this restaurant. Our server was nice enough, but left part way through our service and the others didn't seem to care much, weren't helpful, and you can tell they don't like their job here. Ordered angel hair bolognese and had to ask our server if it had meat in it or if there was a mistake because there was so little of it. He did take the dish back after we asked this, but the second wasn't much better. Also ordered linguini with \"white clam sauce\" which ended up being pasta in a flavorless watery broth. Not only were these dishes nothing like what they were named, they did not taste good. For these prices ($100 for our dinner) I would strongly suggest that you spend your money elsewhere. There are so many other great options in Old Town."}
{"text":"The Italian Grotto is a stop I must always make when I am in Arizona.  This small Italian gem is hidden between all of the art galleries in downtown Scottsdale.  I have brought many family members here and not one has been disappointed.  Gary (the owner) is the Mark Cuban of the restaurant business.  He personally will check on every table to make sure that everything is going perfect (trust me, it is), and offers service and food that can only live up to his high standards.  The food is just amazing.  I have been there on numerous occasions and have yet to order anything but the Chicken Fontina. This dish includes a generous helping of chicken in a sweeter wine sauce that is perfectly countered with the saltiness of prosciutto.  I did try some of my dad's Manicotti last time and I have to say, the meat sauce is awesome.  One of the best meat sauces I have tasted from any Italian restaurant.  I have to say that the Italian Grotto is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona, and a place where I can feel like I am part of the family thanks to Gary."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cute ambiance, but unfortunately that's about all it has going for it. The food was extremely overpriced for what you get... My husband had the chicken Parmesan which was clearly a frozen chicken breast.. It was tough and just very unappealing. I had the spinach ravioli which was 4 raviolis smothered in sauce...   The icing on the cake is we actually had to seek out our waiter to pay our bill after sitting for a good 20 minutes in which we saw the waiter just standing around. We are normally big tippers, but due to the horrible food and bad service our tip reflected that. The waiter then chased my husband down outside the restaurant to ask were we came from because he was obviously upset with his tip.  I usually like to keep to the positive praising of businesses, but this was a terrible experience for our first night in Scottsdale. If you're craving Italian DO NOT go here because you will be very disappointed"}
{"text":"I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but if you are ever planning on being within a 100 mile radius of this place, I would recommend that you read it.   It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.  Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a \"vegetarian\" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. \"Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!\" All I wanted was a simple \"S-O-R-R-Y.\" Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed \"Excuse me!\" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.  A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. \"Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH\" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say \"I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? \" I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked \"Is everyone leaving here?\" We said yes and continued to leave. \"I don't like being insulted like that,\" my father told him. \"Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!\" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.  We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! \"You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!\" Now, my father was mad. \"I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???\" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with \"A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!\" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. \"Just don't end up in the ER!\" my father said.   I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I seriously hope this place burns down. It would make the world a much better place."}
{"text":"Was walking through old town with some guys from work and came across this place. I immediately loved home plate in the floor at the entrance, the baseball memorabilia on the walls, and the baseball playoff game on most of the TVs. The staff were great!  Very helpful and fun to talk to. The food was excellent and plentiful. Prices were reasonable. Don't leave without having a cannoli for dessert!  It is amazing!  I haven't been to Scottsdale before, but would come back just to go here, especially during baseball season."}
{"text":"Last night 6 of my girlfriends and I had dinner here. We had made reservations and were seated promptly. We were however seated next to the door and one of my girlfriends was shoved a few times by other customers because of it. We all shrugged it off and tried to enjoy our night.  First off the 2 stars are for the food. The food was pretty amazing. I had the Chilean sea bass and it was divine. It was served on top of freshly made ravioli and it was incredible. Everyone else had very positive things to say about their dinner. For dessert we all shared 3 cannolis which tasted heavenly. So delicious.  Here is where it takes a turn for the worse...  Our bill arrived and we know that they don't do separate checks. Understandable. We were told we could split it up with our cards as long as we told them how much to charge. Fast forward 2 minutes...as I'm simply writing down how much to charge on each card, a older looking balding man approaches our table and starts mumbling about needing our table and that we have been taking too long. Are you kidding me? From start to end we were there a MAXIMUM of 1 hour, a party of 7 mind you! He then proceeds to come back and again states that we are taking forever with the cards and what is it going to take to get us out of there. I understand that it's a Saturday night, but the manner in which he addressed us was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. It was flat out rude and demeaning.   At first I thought maybe he was just having a bad night and whatnot but after reading other reviews I know that is just his \"wonderful\" personality. I would love to come back for the food but am not going to support a business that is spearheaded by such a jerk."}
{"text":"The food is actually decent, but the management is so awful and rude that I will never spend another dollar to keep that place in business.  Along with every other restaurant in Old Town during Spring Training, they were busy on a Sunday night.  After waiting an hour for our food, we only received half-assed, cold responses from any waiter we tried to stop.  Lastly, we asked the owner of the restaurant he was the worst.  He basically yelled at us, and was completely unhelpful.  The entire staff needs to learn to appreciate a customer.  The service not only ruined our dinner, but the rest of our night."}
{"text":"Really ?!! 5 stars!! I smell a set up.  The owner and staff have never been nice, or polite or respectful to anyone. He once chased a customer down the street \"screaming like a little girl\" to the customers.  No one in the valley has received reviews this good.  Dont believe them he must have had his little\" kiss ass chorus\" write them.  What a joke!!"}
{"text":"The host was an old italian man who was very very rude. The bread was stale, calamari overlooked place was terrible"}
{"text":"Ordered beverage at the bar, long wait, requested a food order to go, bartender said it was to busy for to go orders, I said forget it, I will go somewhere else, he took $5 , and walked away.  Customers next to me noticed and stated he was very rude and orders to go are normal.  He noticed and returned my money, I left the money and went to Oreganos Italian down the road.   Munch much better service and food to go!"}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times, and each time we are more impressed! The food and the ambiance are incredible, the Chilean sea bass with spinach ravioli was delicious! Truly the go-to restaurant for Italian seafood!"}
{"text":"Super busy the Saturday night we went, but we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  Food was great; waiter also great... Made our evening memorable.  Pricey for pasta, but I'm sure we will go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Great place to have a casual Italian meal in Old Town Scottsdale.  We went here craving pasta and they delivered.  They have a great selection of typical Italian food and their price range was great.    Atmosphere is a mix of sports bar and NY Italian.  (They are a Yankees bar so be forewarned :).  Service was excellent and we had fun."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before, but after a restaurant experience like this one, I felt as though it was necessary. Myself and 3 others came here after our finding out the restaurant we originally wanted to go to had an hour wait. Honestly, we would have been better off waiting an hour for that place. Our worst decision of the evening was choosing this restaurant. We were seated right away, but didn't receive our actual meals until an hour later. We received our appetizers fairly quickly, but 30 minutes went by after that and we hadn't heard anything about where our food was. Servers were coming out of the kitchen left and right with everyone's plate but ours. Our server then told us that they were backed up. It wasn't that busy in there at the time, and it sure didn't seem like they were backed up if everyone around us were getting their dinners. We even saw people sit down after us, finish their meals, and leave! We stopped another waiter and asked what could be taking so long, and he said they were just busy. We waited, and waited. The man who sat us seemed to be the owner/manager of the place, so we got his attention and kindly asked if he could check on our food because now it's been 40 minutes since our appetizers. He preceded to argue with us and say \"I know when I sat you, and I sat you 20 minutes ago!\" I've never had the owner of a restaurant basically call us liars and talk so rudely to us. How he could stand there and say that in a stern voice to us when we were the ones sitting there looking at our watches the whole time - I'll never know.   The management was just terrible. That is $15 I'll never spend on a meal there again. We were thrilled to finish our food and receive our checks. Hopefully they'll read the note we left on the back of our receipt..but I have a feeling they could care less if they ever see their customers twice because they get a lot of one timer tourists. Oh, and their bread was extremely hard and cold. Awful experience."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first night checking out the Grotto, and after a bad service experience with another place close by, i was ready to eat anywhere at that point.   I have passed the Grotto many times living in Scottsdale, and have often walked by smelling the aromas grazing my senses while strolling by...i love that they seem to always have their doors/windows open and the tables overlooking the street are fantastic.    Anyway, as Brett S. said , the service can be a little bad but it is definitely part of the charm.  Anyone who has every been to a real Italian \"joint\" understands this.  I was almost pleased with how traditional the feeling was, as in \"if you don't like it, get the heck out\" haha. It was also a very packed Friday night around 730, so i truly expected nothing but a wait anywhere we went, but we at least found a group of down to earth people entering and exiting wearing everything from jeans and a t-shirt like me, golf attire, to going out clothes. No matter your style, they treated you all the same.  Perfect!  (finding a place like that in Scottsdale is hard to do!)  With it being a Friday night and already having a bad experience with a previous place, i just wanted a square meal and to head home, so i didn't do as much sampling as i would have liked.  We started out with the calamari which came with a marinara sauce with a little kick to it.  It looks like they added red pepper flakes at the end, but it was a nice touch.  I had the house salad with vinaigrette dressing...and word to the wise, if you don't like onions, this salad (at least with the vinaigrette) comes with sneaky chopped marinated red onions in it...so beware! The blue cheese crumbles were a nice touch as well.  My friend ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo and i chose the cannelloni. The fettuccine was much smaller portioned than i thought it would be, especially in comparison to my dish...so if you're very hungry, i would stray from this dish.  While normally a classic favorite, i didn't quite like the added spices to the dish, which seemed to be an Italian seasoning.  The alfredo sauce alone was to die for though.  The cannelloni was phenomenal.  Everything was cooked to perfection and flavored out of this world.   Please also note....when this food is done, it's coming to your table, steaming hot! So wait a few before you take your first bite because you'll probably burn your mouth in some way/shape/form! :o)  Overall the Grotto really picked up my night, and being a yankee in a western state...it's nice to have a piece of home right around the corner.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We come to Scottsdale seasonally each winter but this was the first time we tried the Italian Grotto. It is located on a prime corner in Old Town Scottsdale, so it is most definitely geared for tourists although I'm certain they have a local following as well. All of the people we dealt with were very friendly and service oriented. Each one seemed to be in character matching the theme of the restaurant. Sports memorabilia adorn the walls and other photos, etc. that fit the restaurant/ sports bar theme they have chosen. My wife had the eggplant parmesan ($21) which was good and I had the spaghetti and meatballs. ($14) which was just OK. Their sauce for the spaghetti is a bit too sweet and has too much basil in it for my taste. So, you can see the prices are really too high for typical Italian dinner menu items. We also ordered garlic bread ($6). It was over priced for what we expected. After drinks, our bill was about $67 before tip. That is just too much for what we got. So, you might want to think about that before you try it. I understand it has been there for some 42 years, so they are definitely a landmark place in Old Town. We might go back for a special dinner during a night out, but not for a regular meal."}
{"text":"I had a really nice time at the Italian Grotto.    The atmosphere is very \"New York Italian\".  There are comfy leather booths and tv's above the bar playing sports.  It is a great place to sit for a while and have some fun at dinner and watch the game at the same time.   The staff is very cool, most of the time friendly, and the manager could be from the mafia.  The food is typical Italian food, nothing to \"odd\". I like being a bit more adventurous with food most of the time.... but it is was really good. We had the fresh Clams and Muscles in the Portifino sauce.....and I had the Chicken Piccata (yum) and my friend had the Veal Marsala (also very good)."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Ordinary food at prices too high for low quality.  Rude employees.  Old run down environment.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"We had an awful dinner.  Our salads had too much dressing and our Chilean Sea Bass was over cooked."}
{"text":"We decided to start our bachelorette party here. Nothing crazy, just a simple dinner and a group of seven girls . We originally made the reservation for five people, however we had two girls join at the last minute. This was a huge deal for the owner. When we first arrived he was extremely rude and told us we originally said five so now we have to wait. He then asked us if we were looking at him when he was talking? Not sure what he was implying but we were all listening and couldn't get over the fact that he smelled like booze. Once we finally sat down it took way over 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us . When he did, the manager appeared and asked him to move a table. In the middle of our drink order, the server left and didn't come back for another five minutes!  Overall the food was okay, but the appealing customer service is what made our experience horrible.  The topper was at the end when we were finishing paying our bill a man came up to us and asked if we were finished. We said almost. He then proceeded to clear all of our drinks off the table. As if to say get out, we need this table. I will never be back here again."}
{"text":"Simply amazing and wonderful customer service!   We were sat right away and every staff member was extremely friendly and happy.     Our waiter was awesome!  He gave the girls their meal before we even ordered (this kept the girls happy and tatrum free!)  He was attentive and quick.   Food was great!   I had Shrimp Scampi, perfect sauce, not oily or over creamy.   The house salad with Italian dressing is a must try.    Even though this was our first time, it was like having a meal with old friends.  A must stop for every visit now."}
{"text":"My team from work went here for lunch today, and had a great time. We ordered the fried zucchini and mozzarella, and I ate the lasagna for my main course. Food was tasty from appetizers to the main course. Service was attentive...our main server was the best, some of the other servers that were helping (we had a party of 13) weren't the friendliest but oh well. Overall food was great and seemed priced relatively well. The building is definitely older, but don't let it spoil your visit...the food alone made it a nice visit."}
{"text":"God, if i could give this place negative stars i would. The owner is a friggin' prick and a half and the wait staff are just plain horrible - rude, entitled to not work or do anything, and acted like they were all around just annoyed that anyone would dare show up here. All the previous reviews about the so-called \"owner\" (or the guy who just looks like an old white disheveled vagabond at the front who likes to yell at and about people that come through the door) are absolutely spot-on. I should've read the reviews before coming to this place...please learn from my lesson and do the same if you're even thinking about coming here. Will never go back to this S&&Thole! As a side note, i walked down the street to Grimaldi's Pizza and that place is lightyears ahead in terms of food quality, service, and all around appreciation for your business."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Scottsdale to watch a spring training Giants game on Sun. We arrived on Sat. and the OLD TOWN Scottsdale was jumping. We walked by the Grotto and since they had outdoor seating decided to dine their.At first the Host/owner told us they didn't have a table outside.He re-thought it and sat us at a small table which we didn't mind. We thought the service was great the food was great and the host/owner was a HOOT. Of course I am in the restaurant business myself so sometimes wacky is fun! We liked it so much we went back on Sun. after the game and ate there again.At the bar which was fun. We will definately go back the next time we are in town"}
{"text":"This place is so good. It makes you feel like you are in an Italian Mob movie with the decorations! I was treated like a king in there. The owner came up multiple times justto say hi and asked if we needed anything (which we did not because our waiter was on top of it!). Wine selection is a pretty good list- cant go wrong with any food item!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are visiting Scottsdale we make a trip to the Grotto. The food is memorable, the ambiance interesting and the people watching phenomenal. This is a must vist restaurant for any local or visitor. We had the honor of introducing some natives to the Grotto when we spent time in Phoenix area some years back and we have never forgotten how amazed they were learning about the Grotto. We had a wonderful meal and a great evening. A friend is visiting AZ soon and we have told him he must have dinner at the Grotto. We live in Orlando and wish we had something as special as the Grotto here for dining and entertaining."}
{"text":"what a rip off!! food was bland, expensive, and the staff was very rude and could not care about anything. had a question about the bill and the manager was, well I know I made the menu, who cares, I had a question about the bill, and then she tells the waiter don't pour us any more water. Will never go back to this tourist trap and never recommend it to anyone. Bottom line it was 2 hours of my life I just wasted. This place sucked!!! should have read the reviews before I went to this shit hole."}
{"text":"Yeah the location is great but the owner is a d!ck. He's been at this location too long and it's gone to his head. The food is ok but it's a wanna be italian restaurnt. Go to Franco's instead up the block where a real Italian controls the kitchen and knows how to treat people well."}
{"text":"When in Scottsdale we always stop by the Italian Grotto for a sensational seafood feast. Gary Horowitz, long time owner & friend never fails to please. Halibut Picacata & a Seafood Platter hit the spot."}
{"text":"Intriguing restaurant unfortunately the maître d is a pompous ass. Choose to take my appetite and business to any of the other outstanding restaurants in old town Scottsdale. Too many other outstanding choices in the area to treated so considerately."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant is the rudest person I have ever encountered.  He reacted aggressively toward us at a simple request to keep some food warm. We were all perfectly civil, reasonable customers and were treated MOST disrespectfully.  The police were even involved when we wanted to leave in the middle of our meal. He succeeded in ruining our night and obtaining a large sum for food we did not eat because we were so offended by his behavior.  I do not often wish I'll will upon another person. But this man is despicable and I hope you will not support this business.   **the waiter Will was lovely, however"}
{"text":"Wow! I have lived in Phx forever and never knew about this fabulous gem! I was with 6 others and we were all very thrilled with the food and service! Garry entertained us thru our complete meal! Being italian myself, this is my forever go to for Italian! You cannot go wrong with anything! Thanks Garry, from Mrs late, cell phone user!"}
{"text":"My friend and I split and enjoyed the seafood over pasta special (it's an extra $5 to split entree which I usually won't do, but you get an extra salad so it was okay).  Service was good, environment relaxing, and my friend got to watch pro football game at same time (key requirement for the night).  Fried calamari hit the spot as appetizer.  Owner seemed to know what he was doing and had his being gracious groove on.  Waiter was good.  Clientele diverse."}
{"text":"Amazing, traditional Italian food for a great price! I was very pleased to find this eatery and I take all my out-of-town guests here. Also, like myself, the owner is a huge San Francisco Giants fan so the walls are covered with World Series memorabilia. Makes me feel like I am back home in the Bay Area! Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for 10 years and were curious to see if it was still here. We were looking for a Xmas eve place to eat dinner and it was last minute. We were able to get in at 6:30. It was a really wonderful evening. Very old school feel(no pun). Our server was a delightful older man and made us feel at home. My mother in law was very impressed when she had a small spill and her brought her soda water, and even a small pen to dab where needed.   The food was terrific. Had small bowl of clams (would have gone large if I knew how good they were) and really enjoyed the crusty bread with the broth. We had basic pasta dishes. All good and they included salads. This at a price of 10-12, per.   Dessert was a treat. Had heard the tiramisu was good and it was. The spumoni was also good and big enough to share.   Great evening!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Do not give a penny to this establishment! The owner, Gary, and his waiter Brandon, aka the Meatball, are so incredibly disrespectful and rude. I cannot believe how this place is still in business. We were a party of 6 and my husband's entree was delivered incorrectly. This is where it went completely sideways. Brandon was so obnoxious and defensive and denied getting the order wrong. Wait, what? Just please take back the pasta with the red sauce and replace with the requested Alfredo sauce. Nope. We were delivered our bill for over $500 and Gary the owner told us to leave or he was calling the police. I was so completely shocked and embarrassed.Please read other reviews. I could not believe that so many others had the same experience. So awful!!"}
{"text":"This place made my stomach flip! The owner was rude and assumed that we did not speak English because our skin was brown. I have never felt more offended in my life.  And then he acted like he was giving us complimentary glasses of wine and appetizers to redeem himself as a \"New Yorker\" and charges us    The place is way overpriced and nothing special.  Move on now !!!! We had an app and a glass of overpriced wine and decided to leave because of the offensiveness.   Disgusted by what an owner represents"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to walk around old town and stopped for a bite to eat. The food was okay, but the service was horrible. Our server was completely disrespectful and didn't seem to care about our table at all. We asked him to put on the ASU v UA game, and his tone bye took with us was something I hope my 14 year is sister will never hear again in the service industry. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Went in here with my wife and two sons back in early March. To start off, the owner/host made a rude comment about my kids not sitting in the outside seating area. It was late and I didn't want to deal with going somewhere else so I dealt with it.   Next I took my son to use the restroom and was absolutely disgusted by how filthy the kitchen, bathroom and rear dining areas were.  There was food and garbage all over the floor it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months.   I tried to convince my wife to leave, but at that point we had ordered already and she asked that we just \"deal with it\".   We did and when the food arrived, I asked the server for some plain butter for my son's pasta. His response \"we don't have any plain butter. Just the boursin that's already on the table.\"    I've worked in restaurants my entire adult life and have never come across one that didn't have plain butter (in fact I'd wager to say it's impossible).  To top it off the food was bland and clearly not fresh.   Bottom line is that if you're going to be rude to your patrons, you sure as heck better serve better Italian food than an Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"I am surprised to see a bunch of negative reviews. My fiance and I went here last night and had a great meal. Our server was amazing. We are from NY so this place reminded us of home and the food was very tasty.  I would recommend this place for some good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Great reception upon entering and great food!  No one will be disappointed (unless you are looking for a real fancy place with fancy menus), but I bet the food at the Italian Grotto is better!"}
{"text":"I once experienced this lovely little Italian place on the corner-and I return again, and again. The service here is always excellent.  The music, ambiance, and big booths are fantastic.  Everything here always tastes fresh and perfect! My favorite is the chicken picatta, is yum-yum delicious! (Clam buckets for appetizers are also a giant plus!)"}
{"text":"My boyfruends dad was in town last week and we decided to go to grotto. We had been numerous times before and always enjoyed our food.  When we arrived we were seated at one of the booths since our party consisted of 6 people. I will agree that the place could use a good spruceing up, and perhaps better lighting.   The only real complaint I have is that our bread was hard as a brick, and difficult to chew. Our entrees all came out hot and delciscious. I order the Shrimp Scampi and would definitley recommend it to others. My boyfriend is a big fan of the chicken picatta.   One issue I did have, is that while our both was near the bar, I noticed a lady dressed in jeans and a tank top was seated there, then she was back in the kitchen. Not sure if she was an employee, or one of the owners, but she was helping serve the dishes, and bringing food out from the kitchen which I thought was odd considering she just left her purse at the bar..."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place after driving in from Orange County. We decided to spend the night in Scottsdale and check out the downtown.  We immediately loved the decor and definitely had a local feel. We were seated at the perfect table which was right in front of one of the windows and next to the bar! And after the long drive we were looking for cocktails! I had a Kettle One dirty martini which was perfecto and my hubby enjoyed a margatini - both hit the spot. To start out with we ordered the mussels with the Rapallo sauce which was delicious and a nice sauce to also dip our bread in - heaven! Next I enjoyed their house salad which was fresh with a light dressing while my husband enjoyed their minestrone soup. It was truly one of the best soup's we have had.   Then we ordered a nice bottle of Barbera that went perfect with my Grande Lasagna which was fantastico! I never order Lasagna but had a craving for a heavy pasta and it was right on spot. The several different cheeses, meats and sauce did a happy dance in my mouth. It was perfectly baked not dry or overdone. Meat sauce then ground meat and Italian sausage layered with two cheeses - ricotta and mozzarella! This was not a noncaloric meal something that Paula Dean or the Barefoot Contessa would approve of! My husband had the Veal Carolina and he said it was great - I will take his word for it as I do not like veal.  Since we were full and \"stuffed like a tic\" as they say in the south we forgo dessert although it was very tempting. We enjoyed our experience here tremendously the food was great and the service was very attentive. If we stumble back in Scottsdale we will be sure to return and hopefully enjoy a dessert next time."}
{"text":"WARNING::: do not eat at this Restrauant!!! The short, greasy guy with long hair does not speak English!!! He mumbles and stumbles..... We nearly got into a fist fight at the front door.... Old town needs to raze this Restrauant and start over......"}
{"text":"Amazing meal, great service, halibut and chicken Carolina, our waiter was very charming, helped up with menu example the favorites. Great taste, rich flavor, loved the minestrone soup, we will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom. The owner tells us there's no wait, but if we want a table next to the window, those people were finishing up and would be out soon. What a good guy, right?  Wrong.  Half an hour later, we discover not only that the people were done, he had seated other people at that table. We go to complain, and the owner basically says it's our problem, but we can take a spot on the now-substantial wait-list. Needless to say, we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"I recently ate at this restaurant and had a horrible experience.  I was forced to give it one star just to post this review! Our waiter was rude, lazy and condescending and the owner was even worse.  The wine was awful and when my friend tried to talk with the owner about it he basically told her to shove off and leave him alone.  The salad was more of a soup with a few pieces of lettuce thrown in and I got horrible food poisoning from the linguini with clams.  When I called to let them know about it afterwards I was told that it could never have been a reaction to any of their food - it must have been something I ate elsewhere.  I knew this wasn't possible and told them so and they very rudely hung up on me.   I've been in the food industry for years and have never run across anything this crappy and obnoxious.  Obviously the customer is their last concern at this restaurant. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, way overpriced for the size of the portion. Our waiter was incredibly rude and belittled us for asking to split the bill. NEVER COMING BACK!!"}
{"text":"When I walked into this place I felt like I was walking into a restaurant from Baltimore's Little Italy. The service was to the point but personal... Wine list was limited but selective, and the menu was excellent. Great bread, nice fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food, because it literally took so long to get that we walked out before it arrived (nigh on 2 hours).  Now I'm writing this review from a hungry angry place, so I apologize for the language.  But fuck, they should probably be out of business."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were in old town Scottsdale for lunch. Came upon the Italian Grotto which smelled good, Frank Sinatra music playing and a lovely outdoor patio. We decided to stop and unfortunately met the owner Gary. We have never experienced such a rude, crass individual.  The cushions on the seats needed replaced, and the table was less than steady. However, this was not an issue in the grand scheme of things, as Gary became quickly ruder as the seconds sent by. Simple questions concerning the menu were met with contempt.  For example, he would not bring us glasses of water, but only bottled water that we had to pay for.....interestingly there were glasses of tap water galore at other tables.  It was hard to believe that 4 confident, smart and outspoken women would be left speechless by such overt disrespect for the patron.  As were about to get up and leave before ordering we were rescued by a new waiter; Kris. He was polite, kind and attuned to our needs.   By the way, the food was fine-nothing out of this world. The wine was good. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty.     As we looked back on the day and finally read the reviews about the angry, erratic, rude owner, we wondered if this was all a marketing ploy??  One might wonder if the health inspector should go in and assess not the food in this restaurant, but rather the environment.  As a local I will not be taking my out of town guests there again. In fact, I will be quite vocal with others about this disturbing restaurant encounter."}
{"text":"Great food, great service,  however some idiot that works there was offended after he said order up and so I repeated, order up.  He threatened to kick me out for saying order up.  What an idiot,  they have such great food, great bartender and the place is empty and I get threatened for saying order up, get a life loser! !!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last five years during spring training and have always been so happy with my meals. Everything I've tried had been delicious. The staff is really great, they all seem like a big happy Italian family. The food portions are are generous and and they don't skimp on the garlic! Love it :)"}
{"text":"Wow! Now it's a scene, but it's classic. Great food, fair prices. No nonsense, but professional service.  An annual tradition for thousands. Make reservations in advance. Order the cheese & tomato bread to start."}
{"text":"Went here for date night last night with my boyfriend and we both loved it! Great atmosphere, great staff, and great food. If it's nice weather out, make sure you sit outside on the patio... Beautiful view (especially at night with the pretty lights). We will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience!! Food might be ok never got that far the owner was so RUDE we walked out!! Extremely Bad Karma for charming Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Our server was delightful. Funny and knowledgeable. However the portions were smaller then I remembered. Still plenty to eat don't get me wrong. Shrimp scampi was delicious.  Garlic toast is Devine. I wanted to sit outside but last Friday the winds were too much. They had already set up another table inside for us when we arrived. Very nice. Thank you. See you guys again soon."}
{"text":"We ate here while on a weekend get away. When we first walked in I could not figure out if it were a bar or restaurant. We looked at the menu and decided to give it a try.   We were seated by the host who appeared to be drunk because he was pretty damn obnoxious.   We waited for 7 minutes before we got a menu. Once the menu finally arrived we put in a drink order because the service was obviously going to be slow.........and boy was it slow!   We ordered calamari, mussels, and a caesar salad after waiting for what seemed like forever.   The calamari was good but nothing special, the mussels were pretty awesome, and the caesar salad was not that great and had no taste.   The waiter never offered any parmesan cheese or cracked pepper for the caesar salad and was no where to be found for us to make the request.   The mussels were good but everything else including the drink was not good and the service was basically non existent."}
{"text":"Make no mistake. This is a tourist restaurant geared to get you in and get you out. There is no leisure dining here. Quick, brusk, and efficient service is designed for speed. Linger over coffee and dessert and you will be asked to remove yourself to the bar. With the food just okay and so many excellent restaurants just steps away it makes no sense to eat here."}
{"text":"I love Italian and I eat here often. Love it! Great homemade Italian organic as well! Marco is a very nice man has been every time I've been there. They recently started doing lunch big plus!! Margarita pizza (as I call it). Yum!! The food is so great we had our company Christmas party there that night I had clams in white sauce over pasta with a spice level 1"}
{"text":"Never EVER have been treated this way by a restaurant manager/owner(?) & server no better! My husband & I always share and we asked for suggestions from waiter. Took him up on the Chilean Sea Bass. We were very hungry and ate it tho salt was the primary flavor. Our friend ordered a dish with capers but it was inedible. I sampled it and it was saltier than ours! He told the server. The owner dude burst over and loudly exclaimed \"how dare you criticize my chef\"! He was going to remove this untouched meal from the bill but when noticed we had split the plate, he bellowed out \"what?! Only 3 meals for 4 people! Get outta here & just don't tip!\" Needless to say, the ruckus was over the top & we were aghast! With all the good choices around, we really were treated like garbage!"}
{"text":"Our last night in Scottsdale, we decided to have dinner in Old Town. Craving Italian, the four of us headed here. We snagged the last table on the patio so we were able to enjoy our dinner and drinks while we watched the hustle and bustle going on around us. I went with the scallop scampo (sea scallops in a white wine & garlic butter sauce) plus I got to sample a bit of everyone's food since we each got something different (clams in a rose sauce, chicken parm with spaghetti and sausage with cheese ravioli). I thought everything was pretty tasty and the meals were reasonably priced (around $20/entrée). We didn't make room for dessert (our server almost convinced us to cave in to the tiramisu) but we were able to enjoy the atmosphere for a little bit while we finished our drinks.  Is there better tasting pasta out there? Sure, but I didn't mind this place at all. I'd be back again if the opportunity came up."}
{"text":"This is a RETALIATION POST.  Should we start with the ambiance, people watching or wine selection.  All good.  No, we'll just dive in to the horrible handling of a bad dish.  My girlfriend ordered Veal Piccata and the dish was too salty to eat.   I was done with my meal by the time our waiter asked about her plate ( he took the plate away and said the \"boss is fixing it.\")  The \"boss\" came back from the kitchen with the original veal re-plated as a thinned down version of the original and blamed the saltiness on the Romano cheese.   [I've seen  the movie Waiting and could not discern what thinning agent they used.]  She did not taste the rinsed off version of the Veal Piccata.  She sent the plate back a second time.  The waiter told me that the boss and the chef had tasted her food and it was fine;  that same plate was redelivered to her to eat.  They charged us full price for the entree and offered no renumeration for their inedible meal.   Loved the soup, good wine and my Chicken Marsala, but when faced with candid legitimate criticism, they were indignant, incredulous, and rude."}
{"text":"Who are visiting from Southern California. We drove to old town Scottsdale were looking for place to eat. We saw a sign outside a restaurant that said \"we have here since 1977 and we must be doing something right\". We looked at the menu posted outside the restaurant  and decided that it was okay to go in and eat. We walked in and the place was empty. We were seated and given menus.  When we looked at the menu I realized that the menu we had  been given did not match the menu outside. The menu we had been  given had prices that were double the ones on the outside menu. I asked the waiter if we  could be given the menu that  outside. He just told us that certain items on the menu we had were 8 dollars. He  never gave us the menu outside. When we were ordering our meal my son asked if you could add shrimp to Alfredo. The waiters that said that he could not do that.  I told him that we were going to pay for the shrimp. The waiter responded that he would have to charge $17 for the extra shrimp. We said thank you but no thank you. When he brought our meal  to the table he asked if we wanted cheese. We said yes and as he was poured cheese on our food he also sprinkled it all over the table.  Food was okay. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here before and I liked it. Not impressed this time. I ordered Chicken Benito. It was not prepared as explained in the menu and chicken overcooked. Nothing is worse than overcooked chicken."}
{"text":"******ATROCIOUS, DISRESPECTFUL, INSANE, MENTALLY UNSTABLE AND HIGH ON WEED FATHER SON DUO.....STAY AWAY*****   First off, the owner let in people who came way after my family and me. The only reason was because he seemed to be more friendly with them than his other customers. We ordered and the service was OK as to what happened afterwards. My daughters \"vegetarian\" soup had pork in it which we don't eat. We told the owner and were expecting a nice apology. NO. What we got was WAY worse. He started lecturing us about how no ones perfect! I didn't come here to get a lesson! I came here for a peaceful friendly dinner for my father in law's birthday. I have to make this short (it's too long to write) at the end his demon son ended up kicking us out even though we were already leaving!! He tried to make it seem like we were being kicked out! Unbelievable DONT GO HERE!!! THE OWNER YELLS EVEN AT CHILDREN!"}
{"text":"I'd give this negative stars if I could. Way overpriced  for terrible food and a rude waiter. I was expecting so much more when we walked in and feel like we got entirely ripped off. I rarely give Yelp reviews but was so dissatisfied with our experience that I felt this was definitely worthy of one."}
{"text":"Great Italian spot that will no doubt convert you to a regular. My wife and I swung by on a whim and fell in love."}
{"text":"For a Benji [i.e. $100] this place was a huge disappointment for my wife and self. The service was decent but unfortunately the food was served cold and undercooked. I'm pretty bummed this place was such a huge let down. I will say this however, the owner is really good about honoring those who make reservations and not letting passer-bys whom didn't plan ahead get seated ahead."}
{"text":"I hadn't been there in about 3 years. The food was delicious. But the waiter RAISED THE PRICE ON ME,,,IT WAS A PRICE which was not the price on the menu!!  I saw a menu for lunch, but then the waiter raised the price by $5.00 dollars MORE for my entree and an extra dollar for my iced tea!  I didn't really think about it until I got outside, thinking that the lunch I had bought was a bit too expensive, while rechecking the lunch menu posted outside. I had already paid for my meal and left. He had definately raised the price on my lunch meal by $5.00!!!  There seems to be somekind of SCAM going on over there. Maybe the owner wasn't around..."}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian food in Old Town tonight.  We started with a antipasto and calamari - both good enough to get us excited about the entrees.  The Chicken Parmigiana and Shrimp Scampi were incredible.  I doubt you could go wrong with anything on the menu.  Definitely a leisurely pace and couldn't be farther from a chain restaurant.  Fresh ingredients, an outstanding menu and authentic charm make this a local favorite."}
{"text":"If you want good (even great) food and GOOD service, just walk down the street a block or so to Bandera"}
{"text":"Meh, very poor choice for the money. Pasta can be bought at Frys - 2 boxes/$1. Wine is vino equivalent of Budweiser. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I love reading this restaurant's Yelp reviews. Consensus says this owner is a real tool, and he can typically be counted on to make an ugly appearance in these predominantly one-star posts. With staff consistently following ownership's sorry customer service example, I can count on finding a new restaurant horror story here virtually every day. If it weren't for the fact that the food gets as much bad press as the folks at work here do, I'd pay the price of admission myself just to see this freakshow live and in person. Keep up the carnage, Italian Grotto. I love reading all about it."}
{"text":"WOW. Where do I start. We made the unfortunate blunder of eating at this restaurant this evening after a spring training game. We were greeted by a very friendly guy outside on the corner who worked there and told us there was no wait. So we thought we would give it a shot.  Nice atmosphere in this place. People drinking having a fun time seemed like pretty friendly staff. Then our waiter arrived to our table. MAN!!! What a creeper. He seemed to be high on some kind of narcotic , blood shot eyes. Didnt really introduce himself either. Explained nothing about the menu or any specials if any. By his overall demeanor and attitude seemed as though he was doing us a favor by taking our order. He also was wearing a baseball   cap too. He was very laps in filling waters and being over all attentive.  For the food. GEEEZ. We ordered the Fried calamari and by the looks of the portion I would believe our stoned waiter may have dropped half of it on the floor on the way to our table.It was some of the smallest scrap pieces of calamari I have ever seen!! Very bland too!! It was maybe 13 pieces very small too. the spicy marinara that came with it for dipping was pretty good so I thought \"maybe this is not a total lose here\". I was WRONG!!!  The salads came out with watered down dressing (blue cheese) and the salad had no flavor or texture. Throw in a crouton or red onion for some bite!!! Uneven chopped tomatoes too. It really looked like it was thrown together given the fact it came out 2 minutes after our calamari came to the table. (the portion of calamari was so small that we still pretty much finished it anyway) but still it seemed very rushed. And another waiter sarcastically said \"seriously?\" when we turned down parm cheese on the salad. As the only salad I put parm cheese on is a Caesar salad. Not a house salad with blue cheese.   Entrees , what a let down. I ordered the Veal Parmesan. It had no flavor the texture of the veal was very chewy not tender. The sauce was ok but not as good as what came with the calamari. They served it on a bed of rigatoni and there we maybe 8 pieces of pasta too. The breading on cutlets were not seasoned and the was not browned enough. The cheese was barely melted as well.   My girlfriend ordered the \"white soupsagna\" yes I said \"SOUPSAGNA\" as this white lasagna was a 3 layer mess swimming in a sea of alfredo sauce. The flavors were better then my veal . But again the portion for the price was sub par. It mostly was floating in this alfredo sauce. I can tell it was not baked. The noodles were strained in the colander , layered with the ricotta and DROWNED in the sauce. It did not have that signature resistance standing up to your fork when you dig in that you normally feel. It kind of just fell apart . The layers were very loose and soupy. Our bread was pre cut and must have been sitting too as the outside was getting stale.   I cannot believe this place has gotten the kinds of good reviews it has. Maybe it was what we ordered? Or an off night? But so many things missed that I cant believe this place has been serving scottsdale elite as long as it has.  I know Italian food. I am Sicilian, from New York and have studied Italian culinary cooking at schools in the city for years. I have eaten at Carmines and Raos in Manhattan. Dan Tanas in Los Angeles. These are good restaurants!! I know good italian food!! This is not it. You may be better off going across the street to Buca di Beppo  LOL . If you are in Scottsdale I would recommend Veneto Trattoria for italian."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the decibel level in the place was deafening. We ate as quickly as possible to get out of there. Dreadful."}
{"text":"In Old Town Scottsdale--  Tom the Bartender - was great and all over whatever we needed, whether a drink, food recommendation or great stories.   Food was really good.   When we were there a party of 19 took 3.5 hours and wanted separate checks and were annoying as heck. The owner (Hard core guy from New York), think his name is Gary, set them straight and kicked them all out! It got a little ugly, but was awesome! Good to see there are still some people who aren't politically correct and don't take crap. He was looking out for his business and the waiting staff.  Kudos to him. He and his wife were great with us and other customers as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I and family are long time customers.  It was one of our favorite places. Today we decided to shop on main street around midday and then go to an early dinner at the grotto. My wife decided to use the restroom there since the restaurant was almost empty.  She didn't see the sign on the door. The  waiter chastised my wife for \"not being a customer\".  We continued our shopping but my wife got very upset. After shopping I went and talked to the waiter and the owner to explain that we are regular customers and my wife was upset. The owner really didn't care and pointed to the sign in the door two times and told me \"I wasn't listening to him and to read the sign! read the sign\". He repeated loudly to me. I just shook my head and walked away from them.  last time that we go to this restaurant. What an idiot!"}
{"text":"From what i hear this was one of Sammy the bull's Italian watering holes and is still frequented by the AZ underworld, that is enough of a ringing endorsement for me... a compliment guys, don't wack me. Short of looking to your right and seeing Tony Soprano and the sign changing to Vesuvios this is the closest to an Italian-movie experience you will have. Complete with tables being pulled out, terse yet endearing fat men barking \"what cha want to drink\", and INCREDIBLE Italian food. Two words, Chilean Sea Bass... three words i guess. It is served SWIMMING in garlic and butter over a bed of linguine. It is so tender it falls apart just watching you pick up your fork but beware of the killer garlic breath that will ensue once you have licked your plate clean. By no means cheap but worth every penny. Cannelloni, salad, parm ... amazing, i have never had a bad meal here.  I will be stopping by when i am home for xmas, it is that good."}
{"text":"Went there with another couple.  Right off the bat, our waiter told us that the service is lousy but the food is good, which is why people keep coming back.  We appreciate honesty.  I had the veal carolina, which was among the best Italian I've ever had.  My wife had baked ravioli, which she thought was just alright.  The other couple we were with liked their food as well, one having a different veal dish and the other the sea bass.  The service really wasn't all that lousy but it definitely was sub par (we waited for the check for a while).  This is probably because our waiter was an ex-football player who we're sure was concussed one too many times.  Another waiter (we're assuming the owner) saw to our table as well and talked to us how the other waiter isn't going anywhere.  It's good to see people taking care of people.  Though the service wasn't the quickest, our drinks were always full and the waiters are happy to chit chat.  Very personable and quite the characters.  I'd be happy to go back and try some more of their food.  It's a bit pricier than places not in Scottsdale but I've had worse food that was more expensive (like Rustler's Roost)."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Great Italian food.  It's always crowded (except in the heat of summer) worth the wait and always good.   The eggplant Parmesan with a mushroom sauce is exquisite.  Everything we have tried on the menu is great.  It's a highlight to a trip to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My food came out one degree above room temperature. Not worth the money. Fried artichokes were alright but pricy for what it is."}
{"text":"always great service.......the best. bought a condo near by 2 years ago and always go at least twice a week while in az. meatballs, the veal, etc. are excellant. but those who enjoy a fun server with expertise you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The Worst!!!  0 stars!!! should be negative stars! Waiter overcharged us $4 each meal over menu prices. The sea bass was nasty, greasy, fatty and disgusting. The veg. parmesan was uncooked mushrooms, thin slice of old eggplant not fresh. Salad was a few pieces of lettuce ONLY, no tomato or cucumber? This place is a total tourist RIPOFF! Please do not spend your money here. I looked on yelp for local restaurants and did not see any reviews until I got home to see all of the warnings from other disgruntled patrons. I normally do not take time to post feedback but I feel bad for others behind me spending their hard earned money in this place."}
{"text":"This was a great place to end the night.  Let me provide background: 6 of us girls went out to dinner (at Furio) for a lovely Girls' Night Out. After dinner, we wandered north down Scottsdale Rd looking for a place to sit, chat and get a drink (or two).   When we hit Italian Grotto, one of my friends said, \"Oh, this place has the best margaritas.\" It happens to be a favorite spot of her father's, and we peered in - it looked perfect.  They seated us enthusiastically, and the entire place was oozing \"NEW YORK.\" It was great. Our waiter was friendly, nosy, and flirtatious. Great for a group of married women out for a night. :-)  I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink. I told him I wanted vodka, but not a vodka tonic, but nothing too sweet .... He said, as he walked away, \"you're having a Mandarin Press.\"   Well, OK then.  Our drinks arrived, and I loved mine. Mandarin vodka with Sprite cut with club soda. It was fizzy and yummy and not too sweet.   A couple of the girls ordered an Appletini and the Cadillac Margarita (pretty strong drinks), so when two of us polished off ours earlier, the waiter came back with replacements (another Mandarin Press for me and a Gin & Tonic for another girl) and told us they were \"on him.\"   The music they played was great - jazzy and classic. The bar had rows and rows of Yankee bobble-heads, and the 3 flat screens above the bar featured basketball and baseball.   I think we sort of closed the place down. It was 11:00 when we started to think about leaving, and the place was emptying.   It was exactly what we were looking for - a nice big round booth great for conversation. Perfect ambiance for the low-key end to our evening that we loved.   I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"On a warm spring afternoon we had a craving for pasta. I looked around for a place in the area and this seemed to be the best of limited options near Old Town Scottsdale. We made a reservation and Ubered over arriving a few minutes early.   The host who sat us seemed a little overwhelmed with what seemed like a light crowd. Our waiter was cordial and efficient but not very friendly. It was as if he was on auto pilot. I'm not one to make to harsh a judgement on one visit but the start was certainly less than smooth and inviting. We ordered up some drinks which were promptly delivered. The Knob Creek Manhattan was well made but could have benefited from a better vermouth and a couple luxardo cherries over the standard issue maraschino. The Vodka martini was well made, certainly the easier of the two drinks, but the one that suffers most if made improperly. The busboy was very engaging and made great conversation. He was the one staff we encountered that was really a plus.   We ordered a couple plates of pasta, mostly out of Yelp folks talking about the misses in execution of the more elevated dishes. I had the soup and my dining partner had the salad. Both were well prepared, nothing I would seek out on their own. The Italian dressing on the salad was nice, and the salad did have a nice assortment of ingredients.   The plates of pasta followed in short order. The Fettuccine Primavera was nice, good sauce, standard vegetables, but ultimately nothing much above average. Not that there is anything wrong with that. The other plate was spaghetti with mushroom sauce and homemade sausage. This was another highlight of the evening. The sauce was really tasty, though a little too heavy on salt. The mushrooms were in generous quantity and added a nice depth of flavor. The sausage was also a winner. A real homey / comfort food sort of plate. The prices were fair for the area. Some of the \"elevated\" dishes came with the expected \"elevated\" price. All in all I would come back, if I had the craving for above average in quality, and simply prepared pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Never again will I go back. The service is outrageously bad. \"meatball\" ...thats right he actually says to call him that...to EVERY table. Was downright rude and the ego was radiating! I think he thought he was in the move \"good fellas\" or something? Second time here and we still feel the same way. We thought the first time we would give it another shot but never again! The manicotti was not even good..it was chewy and the mozzerella on top was burnt. Not to mention the sauce was just stewed tomatos out of a can. NEVER will we return."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise!  We went for an early snack. Ordered a bottle of wine and split one of the pasta (manicotti) entrees which came with bread and salad.  It was fantastic!  Very authentic New York. Very hands on staff/owner/manager.   We also couldn't resist the fresh made tiramisu!  This will be one of our regular stops whenever we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food is great, check out the pricing for the pasta dishes great value. I love the way it feels old, dark and alive, like being back east. Eating at the bar is fun always good conversation. Have had many parties there waiters are always attentive. During spring training it is packed, so if you got a seat you were lucky sit back and enjoy the hubbub."}
{"text":"We made our way over to Italian Grotto after the Art Walk and were greeted by a very Italian man that reminded me of a cross of Danny DeVito and Tony Danza.   Theme of the night seemed to be Guy's Night as there were several, SEVERAL tables full of middle-aged men who insisted on hooting and hollering as me and my friends walked by....   It was HOT in this place. I'm not talking sexy, though I did have to take off my jacket to keep from overheating. The ambiance was lacking and I realized quickly that this place was not my style.   Service was fast, but felt a little rushed. The server wasn't very engaging but again was on the ball and quick. He, at times, took plates prematurely before we were finished and without asking.   The bread came out warm and well, fast. As did our salads and our entrees. The salad was great considering it was just a simple side salad. I think the Italian House dressing is what really impressed. I did ask for dressing on the side but instead received it doused to the point that I had a large puddle of dressing in the bottom of the bowl after I ate all the leafs.   I ordered the Cannelloni Florentine for my entree which was pretty good but a little dry. My friends all enjoyed their meals for the most part but none of us were wowed.  Prices really range at this place. Page 1 everything is under $13, turn to the next page, everything is $20+. I could never justify paying $20+ again for mediocre Italian food regardless of it's toppings. I can't imagine I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused by the bad reviews...  The staff was great and the food was amazing, right down to the bread and salad.  Who we assume was the owner was pleasant and seated us at a cozy table for two right by open doors to the sidewalk.  Our waiter was great, friendly, and gave great recommendations from the menu. My husband had the chicken Carolina and I had the chicken parmigiana. To. Die. For.  We both ate every bite!  House red wine was good. We will be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I scoped out a few restaurants  around Old Town when we first arrived in Scottsdale and this place on the corner always seemed to have a lot of diners.We turned up last Thursday about 6.30pm and despite being almost a full house we were seated at a nice table outside within a couple of minutes.I hate lining up for food.I took the advice of a character we encountered at the entrance and ordered the fried calamari appetizer.We also enjoyed a nice serving of garlic bread while we waited for our pasta dishes.Sipping away on my IPA beer and munching on the tasty calamari I couldn't help but notice what an animated and enjoyable time everyone in the restaurant was having.Even the Bronx accent of our sturdy looking server added to the fun of the night.Our meals arrived in good time and we enjoyed them thoroughly.As it turned out the character we had earlier run into at the door was none other than the owner Gary who kind enough to pop by our table to enquire if we were happy with our meals.All evening we witnessed him clearing tables and greeting customers in his inimitable way.This was our last evening in Scottsdale and we had a great time.Thanks Gary and staff !"}
{"text":"Food was average but the service was the worst. We went in with a group of 5 and the server suggested garlic toast for the table. When we got the bill he had generously ordered us 2 orders of garlic toast at 7$ each. So bread that is usually free at most Italian restaurants was as much as a meal. When we asked about it on the bill he became rude and very aggressive. We will never go back."}
{"text":"The Chicken Carolina you cannot go wrong.  They need to change out their table balsamic as it seemed a little stale.  The table bread was decent, the butter was really good.  The house salad was also very good and a little different from traditional Italian house salads.  The service was very good.  Go to places like this while you can as they are few and far between.  You cannot have a bad dinner at a place like this with this atmosphere.  A hidden jewel in Old Town."}
{"text":"First of all, are you a sports bar or are an Italian restaurant?  You've got to make up your mind on that one.   Second of all, please stop dousing the salad with dressing.  I didn't order soup with lettuce in it, I ordered a salad with some dressing on top.    Third of all, I realize that presentation isn't everything, but it is something.  I ordered the Grande Lasagna and was told it was the same size as a normal Lasagna but with some extra sausage.  Well, it wasn't.  It looked like my poor lasagna was eaten whole by some sort of cheese monster, that was then killed, gutted, and served to me.  Why would I want more cheese on top of this pile of melted cheese? Stop asking!"}
{"text":"Best minestrone soup I've ever had! Also, the most expensive Caesar salad I've ever had ($18...really??). Our waiter was super nice but the owner was terrible, smoking a cig in front of the restaurant and blowing it in our face and picking at his ears...gross!!! Not very professional! Good food but owner needs some work."}
{"text":"We too were going to eat at Bandera or we should have just eaten at the restaurant at the resort but unfortunately went to Italian Grotto. It is exactly as these reviews state - dark, old and has a bad odor but the food was fine. As we ate our salad a cockroach was crawling on the bench within inches. We discreetly flagged the waiter, told him and asked to move. The waiter later brought over a couple drinks. After a few minutes we heard escalating voices about six feet from us and within two feet of people sitting at the bar and a nearby table. Instead of taking the waiter into privacy, the man who I assume is the owner with the heavy N.Y. accent was yelling for at least fifteen minutes at the waiter about being free with HIS alcohol. His language included a few choice words also. This was the most awkward dining experience ever. The five star reviews have to be employees, the owner or paid reviewers."}
{"text":"Garlic bread/marinara sauce was outstanding and sooo fresh.  Chicken picanti and chicken alfredo fettuccine was even better. A must try. Friendly service, too."}
{"text":"Insulting, dishonest and bottom line an absolute joke! We made reservations over a month ago, arrived and waited over 40 minutes but that wasn't the problem, the problem was the inebriated owner!  He continued to seat people without reservations and when we graciously asked about how much longer it would be he made a huge scene. He offered to buy us drinks, started yelling and the restaurant got to witness his unruly/unprofessional behavior.  He yelled that since \"your always on your phone all day so why don't you write a review, I won't care I'll be busy anyway\", well Mr.  I'm a writing a review and I hope your restaurant is empty forever more!"}
{"text":"Italian Grotto is a cute little Italian American restaurant. The patio is killer, and although it was a quiet night I can see that it would be an amazing people watching spot in tourist season. The service was attentive, friendly, and helpful with suggestions when my dining companions and I needed them (which we definitely did as there were so many tasty looking options!)   We ordered the Fried Zucchini Del Grotto to share, and I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The zucchini wasn't bad, it was crispy and quite flavourful, and the dipping sauce was good but tasted like a re-purposed garlicky pasta sauce; once I adjusted to that I enjoyed the combination of flavours. The wine was ok - I wanted something American at least (I always try to have the most local wine I can get!), and was recommended the sauv; it was fine, easy drinking but not quite such depth of flavour as I was hoping for.  For my main I had the baked ravioli with pomodoro sauce; I was expecting something in a bowl, oozing tomato, covered in cheese and bubbled up in ooey-gooey happiness. My ravioli was on a large plate, which made it seem kind of small initially - but don't worry, it was incredibly filling! The ravioli was filled with a ricotta which contrasted really nicely with the melted cheese on top. The tomato sauce, however was way too rich for the dish - I was hoping for something fresh to stand out beside the greasy, delicious cheese, and instead it was too intense and I left half of it on my plate.  Having an Italian stepdad has made me fussier about Italian food than I'd like, but I'm trying! I liked Italian Grotto, but I'd still take a plate of homemade pasta over restaurant Italian food any day!"}
{"text":"Wartch your prices! Staff will screw you over as they deliver your bill. Watch every penny. 3 $15 pastas cost us $90.00. Tiramisu&cheesecake  $10 ea. WTF!!! Poor excuse for an Italian grotto"}
{"text":"On a business trip I stopped here for lunch one day.  I had spaghetti and meatballs.  It was very average, I would say no better than the Olive Garden.  The service was decent and quick.  The atmosphere was pretty cool too.  There is better Italian food at a Deli / Italian grocery down the street, much better."}
{"text":"The trailer park waitress said to me:  \"So you're the asshole in the group!\" apparently because I asked for no mussels in my seafood pasta.   When it arrived, it was so spicy I couldn't eat it.  They did not offer a replacement and charged me the full $32.  This place has a great location, but the management and wait-staff needs some charm-school training badly."}
{"text":"Totally overrated.  Totally overpriced.  I ordered the chicken picatta.  Got half of a sliced up chicken breast.  Who got the other half?  For the price I paid of $21.00.   Waiter was arrogant.  And lastly, the minestrone soup was cold with gushy noodles.  So gross.  Just because they have prime property in OLD Town Scottsdale doesn't make them a great restaurant to eat at.  Will never go again."}
{"text":"The service here was wonderful, fast and friendly. When we were getting ready to leave they made a special trip to get us a bag for our leftovers.  That being said, the food was terrible. The raviolis were watery and only came with four, the lasagna was tasteless and the garlic bread was burnt. It was also very overpriced for what we received."}
{"text":"Italian Grotto is delicious. Very warm feel, great appetizers, and very good pasta from my experience. The owner is a very generous kind gentleman who takes great care of the place. Excellent minestrone soup, and great. Small place, prime location. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went there last week it wasn't even busy I waited 15 plus min and no one came to take my order! I had to walk out of this joint   It should be ashamed to be have a location on old town and piss people off and run their business like an amateur little kids! I hope you guys shut down very soon!"}
{"text":"Depending on the wall you face in Italian Grotto, you will notice either SF Giants loyalty or NY Yankees loyalty. Similar to their baseball loyalties, the food quality can swing in either direction depending on the food you order.   First was the fried zucchini del grotto which some of the best that I've tried. Their bread was just too cold and the salad had mushy cucumbers & tomatoes. I had the clams portifino, which was just mediocre. I tried a bit of the Eggplant and Mushroom Parmigiana, which was so good I wish I ordered it myself.   Most of their entrees were around $20 which feels high considering the quality. Most pastas were around $10. The pastas are clearly the better value especially since they include soup or salad as well, but they generally have no meat which was an issue for a carnivore such as myself. The place was very casual with the bar being most laid back while the booths in the back had a more romantic ambiance."}
{"text":"If I could give this place -0 stars, I would! My wife and I came to Scottsdale to meet friends in Old Town for dinner. While waiting for my friends to arrive, we walked the neighborhood. My wife went in to this cute place to check the menu and use the restroom. She came out and suggested that I do the same. Just after entering the men's room, the owner banged loudly on the door and demanded for me to leave - immediately! I own businesses and travelled the world and have never been treated so rudely. I was, and still am in shock! I sincerely recommend you avoid this place."}
{"text":"What a nice little restaurant.  Located right on Scottsdale Road in Old Town, this location offers a nice little Italian opportunity.   The restaurant reminds me very much like a neighborhood restaurant.  There were many at the bar that would appear to be regulars enjoying the happy hour and games on television.  But other seating options offer a nice choice from a quiet booth to window seating that looks out toward the street.  Although too hot to open the doors, I am sure that they would open them during cooler times.   Meals included the Sea Bass with Spinach Ravioli.  Very good.  Other reviews comment that it melts in your mouth and they are correct.  My friend had the Veal Sorrentino which looked amazing.  Desserts are limited.  We had the Tiramisu and Chocolate Chip Cannoli, but very good.   Wine list is limited, but the selection is good and pricing is very reasonable by the bottle.   It will be slightly pricier than your chain restaurant, but it offered a very nice experieince for an extended evening meal and conversation.  Amazingly, it was not very busy and we were able to enjoy an extended dinner and conversation without feeling that we needed to rush out.   Would recommend it and will definately keep it in mind for a nice change.   4 Stars only because there really needs to be something special for me to award the 5th Star.  Probably just missed it tonight though!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with the boyfriend yesterday . Nice little cozy, romantic restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. There were a few people drinking at the bar and one other table so we had the place to ourselves . It was relaxing . I ordered the stuffed manicotti with a salad with red wine ving. My other half had the special which was halbiut over linguini with a lemon butter sauce with capers . He said it was outstanding and finished the whole thing . I enjoyed my food as well . We split a fluffy, decadent piece of plain cheesecake with chocolate drizzle . Overall I adored this restaurant . Our server was on point . Only reason for not 5 stars is because it was 75 for 2 people at lunch. The only lunch specials that were provided was different types of salads... Not pastas or specialty dishes. A smaller version of some of their pasta dishes would be nice and more affordable . I will definitely be coming back but for DINNER! Lunch is just too overpriced ."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 730 on a Saturday night (a busy time...obviously). Showed up at 725 to find a long line full of other kind folks in small parties (2-3 people) who had made reservations and were waiting to be seated while other groups of folks walked up and got seated immediately.......needless to say we left (so, no I didn't try the food...I'm sure it's great but I don't take my business to places that treat customer's this way). Working in the industry has soured me on places like this. Customer service is the ultimate....if you take reservations you should keep them and be fair with your seating priorities."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my wife at The Grotto. Food was great and Garry, the owner was gracious. Doogie the bartender was great. Made a ass kicking martini. If you are ever in Old Town Scottsdale, make sure you eat at the Italian Grotto. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came in with low expectations because of the reviews. It turns out everyone was complaining because the servers don't want to be everyone's best friends. Get over it. They brought food in a timely manner. Requirement over. At 8:12pm on a Saturday night they're out of ribeye and cannoli. You're a fucking Italian restaurant and you ran out of cannoli cream??? That's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Customer service was not so good. I had questions about the menu to which the server did not answer due to laziness. He was rude and it nearly ruined my dining experience. I ordered something I've never tried before and didn't like it but didn't bother to speak up because I felt my server would not have done anything to help considering he was already tired and seemed bothered. Place is nice though. I might go back..."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Terrible service!!!!  Thanks Meatball. Tell Dan Patrick we said Duh Huh!!!"}
{"text":"This is being generous. First red flag (sorry for being indelicate), was the overflowing urinal in the restroom. No one seemed to notice or care. Next, the server placed his fingers all over the rim of the glasses when delivering water. Fast forward to dinner salad that appeared to have come out of a bag, which may have trumped my buddies Caesar salad that had no Parmesan cheese or croutons. For the main course, we bring you a pile of gristle known as veal Marsala. And for your entertainment pleasure, acrobatic servers carrying loaded cans of refuse right through diners at their tables, en route to the trash bin.  Luckily for this place the health inspectors were otherwise engaged for the evening."}
{"text":"I had the best TIME here at any bar in Scottsdale. Do you want amazing service? GO HERE. Feel like your at home? GO HERE. Nuff said"}
{"text":"The inebriated owner commanded us, mere pawns in his game of drunk restaurant chess, to a table in the back with his index finger, very much resembling in manner an old nonchalant cavalry brigadier. That same finger told us, dummies, to wait for minutes next to the table while it got cleaned. But it was a different finger that kicked us out of the restaurant for asking the owner - who happened to also be our waiter - to repeat something he mentioned from his improvised lunch menu. This was the middle finger, which he flipped at us along with a healthy dose of swearing and insults in his determination to make sure that we would never again return to his glorious establishment for our terrible misconduct. But that particular finger came out only after our table was swept away from us in a fury of hate and madness as innocent bystanders watched in horror. We exited the restaurant in silence and humiliation for our contemptible actions. Never again would we stand up for our right to repeat what a waiter says - lesson learned! And never would we receive the honor of trying one of the Grotto's legendary food offerings.   Confused? Then my review has served its purpose. My feeling of confusion lingered on that day, and only after my thought process finally cleared a bit did I start to comprehend the fact that this was undeniably the most repulsive restaurant experience of my life. Thanks to the Grotto, my standards for restaurant service have sank to the bottom of Mariana's Trench! In retrospect, since this episode, I am actually really enjoying visits to very average restaurants. My ultimate recommendation to fellow Yelpers: when your standards for restaurant service become impossible to satisfy and you see yourself handing out a bunch of 3 star reviews, do yourself a favor and pay the Italian Grotto a visit!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the wonderful food and service! I really thought that \"meatball\" the server was absolutely amazing. Great personality and awesome customer service!  Loved the entree's, dessert shots and outside ambiance. It was a fun Saturday night watching the people in the area have a blast while we enjoyed our meal. Great vibe and very festive! I've been here several times and I will be back, mainly because of \"meatball\" Brandon!"}
{"text":"I wish I there were less than 1 star.  Every negative review is true plus more! I travel for my job, so I usually din alone.  The owner, or the homeless looking guy that runs the place, refused to serve me cause I was alone and could afford to have one person taking up a table.  When I questioned why, his attitude went from extremely rude to crazy!  The next day I went back to complain (not knowing the man I was going to complain about was the owner.  He yelled at me to get out of there or he would call the police.  Long story short, he called the cops on me, so I in turn filed a complaint.  So, if you feel like you have been physically mis treated, call the  cops and get this man out of there!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today during the Parado Del Sol event. After waiting in line for twenty minutes the matre'd asked how many in your party. I told him two to which he asked where the rest of my party was. I told him my wife was waiting outside. He told me that when she arrived I could get back in line. I responded by telling him that I didn't think it was right that I had to get back in line. He then stated \"then I won't serve you at all you ass****.  Needless to say I will never be back to this restaurant.  Jerry K"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant!  It's about the food, because it's so delicious; but it's more about the atmosphere!  It just reminds me of old Italian family when I come in here!  My friends and I stumbled upon this place about 5 years back and have been wonderful patrons ever since!  Now, you have to understand something about this place... it is not a chain and so things aren't run the same systematic way.  Yes, the owner drinks on occasion and is the host... so sometimes you will wait 45 minutes with a reservation.  As you can see, my star rating is still a 5.  Make friends with these guys and trust their opinions and you will be family!  I take my other family there for EVERY major event (birthdays, graduation.. etc).  I just love this place, and I hope you will go and check it out, and remember to get their minestrone soup!  It is to DIE for!!"}
{"text":"We have walked by the Italian grotto hundreds of times, looked at the menu and never went in.This weekend my girlfriend and I decided she needed a Back East fix.  First she made me go to grimaldis for a thirty dollar pizza,it was good.the next  night she wanted really good Italian food.we parked in old Scottsdale, and talked about several places before we walked by the Italian Grotto,we finally decided to go in ,after 16 years of walking past it.We were met by Gary the owner of 36 years,all New York, and all personality.my girlfriend Cathy felt like she was in New York.everything we ordered, the tomato garlic bread,the salad ,pasta and tiramisu were the best. We absolutely loved the people and the food, we live in Kingman and have had a place in Scottsdale for the last 40 years,we know most of the best restaurants, sorry it took so long to find Gary and the Italian Grotto, we will be faithful patrons!  ScottDunton CathyHodges"}
{"text":"It is as a public service I post this review. The owner was over the top, absolutely rude. We were waiting for the rest of our party to be seated and he made a few rude comments insulting my husband and suggesting he and I go have a drink at the bar while my husband waited for our friends. We tried to joke it off at first. As our friends began arriving his tirade continued. Without saying a word we all walked out. He continued to follow us outside continuing his insults that were completely unprovoked and inappropriate. Please take a few minutes to read other reviews before even considering entering this establishment. Conversely, Pink Pony, just up the street ended up being both excellent food and service."}
{"text":"The whole area of old Scottsdale is crowded. Most places take and you should make reservations. On a whim, we went to dinner and wound up here since every where else was an hour wait. We were seated right away and had linguine and clam sauce with a bottle of wine and ceasar side salads.  Tasted good, the service was decent and food got there pretty quick. Place is a little outdated but clean."}
{"text":"The charm of the decor doesn't make up for the rudeness of the staff. They seek only to maximize your bill. $37 for lunch with 2 wines. Don't go there, just don't go."}
{"text":"Wow am I disappointed.   We've been coming here for years but this time we were treated like they never want to see us again.  So that may be the result.   I don't care if everyone in your party hasn't arrived. You should still be seated with a reservation before walk ins. Instead we were told they no longer had a table inside for us so we had to desk with traffic and car fumes through our meal.  And I was told I was complaining and what a bad day they were having. Well my day didn't get bad until my arrival at Italian Grotto.   This has been a must stop for years but no longer."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and they had the Rangers on! Everything was made from scratch. You could taste the fresh herbs. Oh that is the best Italian food. Try the mussels for an appetizer. Homemade sausages."}
{"text":"The food is terrible and the service is even worse. Never have I been treated so badly by an owner of a restaurant. He treats his staff just as poorly. He should be ashamed and embarrassed. Such a low life that he went through the garbage for used cigarettes to smoke."}
{"text":"We went last night despite the poor reviews. We like to make up our own mind. Unfortunately, the poor reviews were being very kind. The food was beyond bad. I am vegetarian so I ordered the spaghetti marinara. They basically heated stewed tomatoes and dumped them on pasta. Zero flavor, zero effort. My salad was equally terrible. Iceberg lettuce topped with about a pound of blue cheese dressing. My wine tasted skunky, like the bottle was opened the previous night and re-corked. The \"garlic\" bread, seemingly had no garlic, only cheap bread completely drenched in butter. The calamari was breaded and fried and had no seasoning, including salt. It came with \"marinara sauce\" that tasted tinny like it came out of a can and was heated up. I would call it tomato sauce - which is an  ingredient, not a finished product. If I am consuming that amount of fat and calories, I like it to be worth it, and it was not. Our bill was $87, and my boyfriend said it should have been half that and even at half price he would not have been pleased. I agree with him. I will never understand why people with no passion for food get into the restaurant business. I guess they just rely on the business of unsuspecting tourists who they know won't be back anyway. Disappointed and angry, quite frankly... Feeling ripped off. If you like fifties music, are from the midwest, and frequent the cracker barrel, you will find it quite chic. The music selection made me want to put a bullet in my head."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you want to be treated kindly!!!! My husband and I were enjoying our Scottsdale staycation.  We had been up and down the Old Town Scottsdale, done some wine tasting, had lunch.  Overall just enjoying our couples time.  As we were coming up on this restaurant, I said I need to use the restroom and then we can settle down and have a drink and get a snack at the bar.  I walked in and started to head straight to the bathroom. The owner chased me down, yelling at me that the bathroom is for paying customer only, I said I plan on going to the bar once I use the restroom, he yelled at me to get out.  At this point I am completely confused on what is happening I look up and some big fat guy (MEATBALL-Seems awful proud of a name that means dull, stupid or foolish) and says I need to leave.  My husband is as stunned as I am and he is trying to figure out what the heck is going on.  I just turn around say ok, and then tell the owner he is a douchebag they literally chased us out the door.  I still have no idea what happened.  This took place in a restaurant full of people.  I might have been embarrassed if I wasn't so shocked by what happened.  I called later to complain about the treatment and Meatball said everything had been recorded and I was now officially harassing them!  When I looked this place up on Yelp, I see this is a common occurrence. The owner needs to sober up (it was pretty clear he had too much to drink) and get a clue, you cannot continue to treat people so poorly and stay in business."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the place after walking by and seeing so many patrons and how good the food looks.. as I walk inside, I notice an ATM on the left side of the entrance and a man in a white shirt walking towards the front. Not sure if he worked there, I asked him if he was part of the staff and he said yes, like I was supposed to know (?) There weren't any name tags/logos or uniform that he was wearing.  I asked him if they take only cash since there is an ATM and he looked at me like I was crazy, then said yes they take cards. As I sat down, the waiter was very stand-offish and didn't really smile or give me eye contact. He actually tossed the utensils (in a cloth roll) in my lap.. totally threw me off.. not sure what was going on, but the food better be good.  I got the spaghetti with meatballs and salad, which were pretty tasty, but portion could be a little bigger. And service is a little lacking, nobody came to check on me while I ate. It's a nice atmosphere since I was sat right next to the 'window', which was an open section/wall to the outside, but everything else was 'just alright' this time."}
{"text":"I think your experience here depends upon whether or not you have to deal with the owner. We never had a chance to even try the food. My husband went up to the host and asked for a napkin for my granddaughter. The host went to reach for the napkin and another staff member rushed up and said \"get the fuck out of here\" Shocked, my husband walked up to me and told me what had happened. (We were about 40 feet away. (My mother is disabled and walks very slow).  I told my husband that we should tell the manager about what had happened. I walked into the restaurant with my 6 year old granddaughter and went up to the person who appeared to by the manager (turns out he was the owner, Gary Horowitz) I was explaining to him what had happened and he yelled at me \" get the fuck out of here and take that thing, pointing to my granddaughter, with you). I was shocked. I said Sir, we just asked for a napkin. If you didn't want to give us one just say no. You don't have to be verbally abusive, especially in front of a 6 year old.\" He continued to scream profanities and insults at me and my granddaughter. At this time the owner was standing at the exit. Yelling and waving his arms. I think he may have been drunk or having withdraws. I was afraid to walk past him and I looked around for another exit but didn't see one. My granddaughter was completely pale, shaking and was terrified. Another patron seen the incident and got up and asked the owner what his problem was. The owner then turned his attention towards the other man and I was able to get out onto the sidewalk. The owner continued his verbal abuse even after we were able to get out. Ppl on the sidewalk attempted to assist asking us if we were ok. Everyone was in shock at what had happened. I ducked into the business next door to calm my granddaughter. They told me that the owner has done this before and that he has an alcohol problem. I wasn't sure if this was something I should bug the police for so I didn't call them. In hindsight, I should have. I wrote the city and they can do nothing since I didn't call the police. I did speak with the Scottsdale Police Department on Monday (the incident happened on Saturday) and they told me to definitely call them for these types of things."}
{"text":"Old school Italian in Old Town Scottsdale!  Loved the relaxed atmosphere, sports memorabilia on the walls and homemade spaghetti & meatballs...YUM.  No slick corporate millennial vibe needed here.  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"When you walk inside, it clearly does not smell like an Italian restaurant - it smells more like mothballs. When we found a table we liked, the tablecloth was a bit sketchy, so maybe they need some new linens and an overall spruce-up would not be a bad idea either. We had the infamous waiter nicknamed \"Meatball\" perhaps due to his rather big meatball stomach (on no, did I just body shame). Well I didn't name the guy, but he was proud of his nickname, but you can't be flirty with the female customers when you look like him. He did do a great job on the fresh pepper grinder and parmesan routine. I really enjoyed my $8 manicotti. The red sauce was deep and rich and the pasta was laced with a tasty ricotta cheese. My dining partner though claimed she got sick from her $8 lunch order of lasagna. The bread and butter was free, but watch out as Meatball will try and upgrade your bread and meals with his sweet talking. Otherwise, this is mainly for tourists, but I would get that dish again."}
{"text":"DIARRHEA GROTTO !!!! At the start of our vacation in Arizona,  we decided to try this popular Italian restaurant.  My whole family shared appetizers and spaghetti dinners.  A couple of hours later, we ALL have DIARRHEA. We have to compete for a bathroom all night.  BE AWARE !!! On top of it, terrible service. The host owner is an old ugly guy with greasy hair, dirty stained shirt seated us with a very RUDE ATTITUDE !!! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Italian Grotto a couple weeks ago. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. It feels very authentic. I love how most of the servers are older (maybe Italian?) men who aren't afraid to be a little loud and outlandish. Our server made great suggestions. The food was really good. I had halibut- piccata style. My boyfriend had shrimp parmesan which he said was also good. I haven't found very many legit Italian places in Phoenix so I'm glad I finally went here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Italian Grotto for several years and have always enjoyed the food. After being a loyal customer for years, I will never go here again. I will never recommend this place ever again either - poorly managed, unsanitary and rude employees. I took my sister here and she noticed the server poured drinking water in our glasses from a large bucket (looked like a paint bucket). Gross! I asked the server and he responded with \"all the restaurants in Scottsdale do that.\" Seriously? I informed him I live in Scottsdale. I wish I was making this up - kicking myself for not taking a picture. We then saw another server hiding and drinking a beer in between doing his work. Then they wanted to charge us for a meal that didn't match the menu. The owner saw all of this going on, but seemed too drunk to care. The server then proceeded to yell at us when we asked to have the meal taken off. Horrible. So disappointed. Not even worth giving them another chance."}
{"text":"We were lured into this tourist trap because of the outdoor seating. My wife ordered the pasta with halibut which came out cold tough and uncooked. She asked the waiter to take it back and was hapy with the bread and soup. The waiter brought it back obviously reheated and she left it on the table uneatened. the owner came over and started yelling at her and told her to go in the kitchen and tell the chef. He then promptly told her to drink her wine and \"Please Leave\". We were astonished and left. DO NOT go to this restaurant. By far the worst we have ever experienced."}
{"text":"SOOOO good. Don't be fooled by the exterior, this place was beautiful on the inside and the food, so delicious! My kids even loved it. They definitely are not set up to handle kids (one high chair and no kids menu), but our server was great with my 4 and 1 year old sons, as was ever other employee that brought anything over to our table at any point.   It was a bit pricey, so I probably wouldn't go back with my kids, but (if I was in the area again), I'd totally want to go back. Great for a date night!"}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday to watch football games and have dinner. I was treated very good and waited on right a way. The food was very good and waiter was polite and knowledgable about the food menu. I was done with dinner in 1/2 hour and went to the bar where I was waited on by Tom the bartender. He told jokes and talked about whatever happen that week in the news and sports. Very good.  Mike M."}
{"text":"No thank you!  This is much more of a bar setting than Italian. They play latin music, one of the servers is very sarcastic and the food is not worth it. Over priced, cheesy goop with paper thin strips of eggplant for my eggplant parm meal. The bread was store bought cold and tasted 3 days old. I will not go here again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Italian food I have ever had. I ordered the Bolognese...Total joke. They chopped up a meatball and served it over tomato sauce. I was in shock. My friend ordered the Cheese ravioli.It was store bought.It tasted like an angry meetingt of salt and garlic.The sauce was Broken,rubbery Alfredo.It was something a drunk frat boy would make after a night of beer bongs and high fives. The calamari was soggy.The servers all seemed drunk.One of the waiters wafted a giant path of Marijuana smoke to our table...He had just gone outside and smoked weed and brought the cloud back to the table with him. This place should close down.It is utterly disgusting. Its like they taught a cooking class in Prison and they hired all of the inmates to work at the Italian Grotto. Zero Stars."}
{"text":"Tried the Italian Grotto for the first time and last.  The salt, pepper, oil and vinegar containers were filthy.  The servers looked like they had just rolled out of bed.  Hair was not combed and their clothing looked dirty.  The music was so loud we could barely talk over it.   I ordered the Cannelloni Florentine. The filling was extremely dry and nothing had any flavor.  I had already asked for black pepper for my salad which was grudgingly provided.  Then I asked for it on the Cannelloni and was told they did not have any. Really? My partner had Salmon Cesar which he said was good.  The bread that came with the meal was extremely stale. While we were sitting at the table looking over the street another customer came in and sat at the bar directly behind my chair so I could not move.  The prices are a lot higher than they should be for the quality of the food, level of service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Great place for people 30+ years old.  i.e me!  Kind of divey but good.  Food was pretty good too.  I had the veal."}
{"text":"During the decade I lived in Phoenix, I frequented the Grotto and became friends with its generous owner/host, Garry Hoffman, a fellow NYer.  He undertakes something difficult in a desert environment--preparation of seafood based dishes, most of which are delicious, if a bit heavy-handed on the garlic.  The only criticism is fully cooked rather than al dente pasta, and uneven service.  Waiters can be informal to the point of careless.  I'd recommend a better selection of wines by the glass, and refreshing the décor, which is dated."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Italian food and wanted to try some restaurants in my new neighborhood. We arrived at 9:18pm. Me and my room mate just about walked in the front door and a heavyset guy I think who had facial hair around 5'10\" immediately walks up to us and asks if we were looking for the bar we said no we would like to get some food. He immediately walks us out and says let me give you some recommendations. We were extremely confused as to what was going on. We asked if we could eat there, he said no. So I asked if they stopped seating for the night and he asks where we were from. We said we just moved to town. I then asked what time do they stop seating because I was assuming that they were closing for the night. He replies \"whenever we want\" me and my friend are still pretty confused about the rudeness and the awkwardness in the situation and I say ok I get that but when do you stop seating on future nights so we could come back and try the restaurant and his reply was \"don't come back!\". As I sit here in the next restaurant we decided to go with I'm still extremely confused as to what just happened and it seemed like this guy was the manager or owner. Now that I see this places reviews and it is a 2.5 star with a lot of reviews from people who actually got to sit down and eat I'm pretty happy I didn't waste my money there. Well sir, we won't be coming back and I will be letting as many people as possible know about how you treat your customers!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service - I can truly say we had a terrible experience at this restaurant that forever left a bad taste in my mouth. Honestly, people should be warned about this place! My father and his friend came in for baseball spring training and we made a reservation at Italian Grotto. We arrive on time - no tables were available. The host was incredibly rude (probably the owner) and treated us like crap. My dad politely explained that we had made a reservation. \"Well nothing's open,\" he snapped, \"so if you don't like it, you can leave.\" I am not kidding!! We were kind of shocked, as we went out of our way to try this place (and walk there in the rain). We asked how long the wait was and he estimated maybe 30 minutes. We left. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Tried to have a seat at the bar... People at the bar and immediate staff were rude. Then asked if they could split a check, they stated that they didn't do that. Luckily I didn't stay and only paid for an overpriced beverage. I went down the street to Tommy Vs _ which was delicious, with live music, and excellent staff."}
{"text":"Great traditional Italian atmosphere from our greeter to the the bartender. Food was very good too!"}
{"text":"Rude, rude service. Also, the food was not that great for the prices they were charging. Asked for al dente pasta and instead got mushy rigatoni that was all in pieces. My dad didn't even eat his meal because his angel hair was mushy as well.   The men's restroom was also a disaster according to one of the men in our party. On a positive note, the garlic bread was delicious."}
{"text":"The host was very rude.  The area where they tried to stuff 10  people was claustrophobic. The bartender actually told me this area is for me not for you! When I asked him do you speak to all your customers that way; The effing moron have the balls to tell me I'm sorry you're having a bad day. I was I having a great day until I walked up to the shit hole restaurant that serves Chef Boyardee frozen food. What an absolute shit hole"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places for dinner.  My boyfriend and I love the food and the staff.  They kind of have that sarcastic sense of humor, which we love.  Gary, the owner, is so good to us.  Always makes room for us.  Tommy, the bartender, and Pedro, one of the servers- always great and remember what we like.  The mozzarella marinara appetizer is a must!"}
{"text":"We really should have read the reviews before walking in to this place. I guess I was attracted to the cute baseball mitt chair at the entrance and all the baseball banners, not to mention it was hot outside and wanting to grab a drink.   We walked in and took a seat at the bar. The bartender was very nice so this 2 star review is no way in reflection of him. He's the only reason I gave it the extra star. But there was this grungy manager (probably the owner) that was yelling at all his employees. I mean really cussing them out in front of all the customers. It made us feel so awkward and we wanted to just leave our drink and walk out of there (which we eventually did).   Then when we were walking out there was an older couple, probably in their mid 60's early 70's that were walking in. The manager/owner said \"where do you think you're going and basically discouraged the couple from coming in. Again super awkward and we just wanted to get the heck outta there. I looked at some of the reviews after and it seems like that's common practice for this guy. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"The Italian Grotto isn't exactly for the faint of heart. The waitstaff is mostly a bunch of older guys from new york and they are a little gruff and direct. Personally, I like it. They once chastisted my sister for moving her bread plate :) The guy said \"Your bread plate goes to the LEFT of your dinner plate!\" and we didn't really know what to say to that, LOL! I am sure that a lot of people are offended by this, but what can I say? I like smartasses!  I've been here twice now. Giving this place 4 stars might be a touch of a stretch because I absolutely noticed some problems. Here we go:  Appetizers: I've had the fried zucchini and the fried calamari. Both obviously homemade and fantastic. Calamari was very tender and not at all chewy. Zucchini needed a little salt, but after that it was perfect.   Salad: I love a salad that doesn't look like it came out of a bag. I've had the blue cheese twice now and I doubt I'll try anything else soon because I like those big ol chunks of blue cheese in there!  Entrees: On my first trip, I tried the Chilean sea bass pomodoro on top of ravioli. The sea bass was great, and the pomodoro sauce was just incredible, but the ravioli tasted gummy and bland, and I actually feared it might have been frozen... God, I hope not. Incidentally, I wanted to ask the server if it was the endangered chilean sea bass or if it was farmed... since it's being overfished and all... but I was genuinely afraid to ask my server about this since I was pretty sure he would call me a name that ends with \"ussy\" and starts with a P, and roll his eyes at my yuppie self. On this same visit, a friend of mine had a chicken dish which was SADLY overcooked and dry was could be, and another friend had the fruits del mer (?), a fettucine alfredo with calamari, salmon, shrimp, scallops and mussels, and it was great, all the fish was cooked to perfection. My next trip I had the sea bass florentine (I KNOW, I should have tried something else, but I just love me some sea bass) and it was incredibly good, seabass topped with spinach and ricotta. However, they forgot to season either the fish or the spinach, but after I salted the dish I thought it was fantastic. My friend had the ravioli pomodoro and she thought it was great, so maybe she didn't think they were gummy, maybe I just caught the raviolis on a bad night!  My recurring issue is that I don't think the chef(s) are properly seasoning the food, if they WERE, I would probably give them 5 stars right now.  However, given that MINOR issue, there is so little good old-fashioned Italian food in this town that the Italian Grotto still has almost no competition, and they WERE mostly fantastic! So, I will be back, no doubt at all. I'll just remember to leave my bread plate on the left and not ask any wussy questions about sustainable fish :)"}
{"text":"Do not call this place Italian.  It is disgusting.  The owner is a pompous ass as is his wait staff.  Generally rude, and condescending .  Lots of foot traffic but everyone walked right by. They clearly were in the know.  Do not waste your money when there are so many awesome places there.  We ate outside and heat lamps and paraphananalia just thrown there.  Yuk!!!!!  We should have read the reviews before we went."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10*'s. Absolutely the first place I'd recommend for a tourist or a food snob. I've been coming here since I first moved to Arizona in 2001, and this is my go to spot. The ambiance is laid back & sexy, and the staff beyond hospitable. I just read a review from Sandy about this place, name tags and uniforms?... This isn't Denny's my dear, Welcome to class..Back to the subject on hand, I do recommend the Chicken Parma and the minestrone soup! Soooo amazing! Applausi"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!  Outstanding service from \"meatball\".  Very good food.  Reasonable prices.  Will be back."}
{"text":"If only there were an option for negative stars. Please read other yelp horror stories before creating one of your own at Italian Grotto.   I dine out 200 plus days per year, factoring in business and personal travel and local experiences with friends and my family in Scottsdale.   Our recent visit to Italian Grotto was easily the worst overall dining experience I've had in the past decade.  My daughters (21 and 14) and I had enjoyed an evening of shopping in old town and were looking for a place to eat and watch the ASU/UA game. We should have known better, because IG was nearly empty on a busy Friday night in old town.  To start, the food has below average and served lukewarm and the restaurant was filthy with a nasty musty smell. The topper was the service and behavior of the wait staff and a nutty old man who seats people, it was truly unprecedented.  After the nutty old guy loudly challenged me for a simple request to change one of the five tv's to the UA/ASU football game, another employee, a large blond women stared us down for our entire meal.  Enough said, there are dozens of incredible Italian dining experiences in Scottsdale. Don't waste your time and money on these clowns."}
{"text":"We came here for New Years Eve and I have to say I came in excited and with expectations of wonderful food!   We ordered the caprese salad and calamari for an appetizer. The caprese salad came out and was bland, but after sprinkling with salt and pepper it was okay at best but certainly not worth the $12. The fried calamari came out and it was okay, but nothing worth writing home about.   My fiancé ordered the sausage and peppers and I ordered the Seafood Alfredo. He said the sausage and peppers was okay, but maybe would have been better with pasta, but instead felt like he got a $5.00 sausage cut up with a splash of sauce.   I ordered the seafood alfredo and it was lack luster. The Alfredo was meh, and the seafood was dirty. While eating the pasta, I also chewed through a mouthful of sand. For $28, I would have rather saved the money for the dish and gone to Olive Garden for $10.   The atmosphere was pretty, and the wait staff okay, but I would tell anyone to save their money and go to Olive Garden because it'll be a fraction of the price and ten times the flavor."}
{"text":"I've walked past this old town restaurant many times and now regret it.  The marinara sauce is reason enough to go back.  I'm a fan of service and this place knows how to serve and let guests enjoy a nice meal.  The bartender was attentive while allowing us to have privacy.  We had the veal parm and veal picatta and both we delicious."}
{"text":"The place was empty when I entered. The staff was accommodating and delightful! The ambience was great. Entrees was reasonably priced. Speaking of the food.... I ordered the Chicken Marsala which came with a salad. The salad was very hearty! Although the dressing was sold as Italian; it was more like balsamic. I like balsamic so I won't go further with that complaint... The chicken Marsala was not so good. What happened to sautéing the mushrooms? They were still raw. As if the chef had hoped the steam from the over-cooked chicken would do the job!  Not very impressive... Maybe I'll go back when I'm not so sober."}
{"text":"I got sick after eating bad chicken here. That was a perfect ending to an experience that started with the waiter not wanting to seat us in the out door area even though there were many tables.  His reason: \"We just double sat it\".  ??? When we said \"OK, thanks anyway\" we did get seated. The same waiter proceeded to try to up-sell every item that we ordered, which was really annoying. My chicken Caesar salad arrived wilted, and tasted off. The waiter chastised me for not eating it."}
{"text":"The host (possible the manager) was extremely rude. I tried to eat lunch here with my kids today. I understand that some restaurants aren't for kids, but the manager waved his hand in my face and said \"I am not feeling this!\". I said \"We can eat outside\" and he said \"You don't understand. I am not going to seat you.\" He was so rude that the group behind me said that they wouldn't eat there. All he had to say was that the don't serve kids or they could have posted it somewhere."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian meals I have ever had! Service was great and our food was out quick. I got the fettuccine alfredo and it was so good. I'm very impressed with this restaurant:)"}
{"text":"The owner was very Italian and a bit scary but it was okay because he was a character and the food was delicious! We ordered tons of different appetizers and the white wine they served us was perfect. I walked out looking four months pregnant. The only downside was that it was a bit chilly inside and I'm not the one to complain about quick service, but I did feel a little rushed between plates."}
{"text":"In Short: Great seafood, but a bit pricey.  Above average for Italian and seafood.  I've been here several times and I'll keep going back for their food for a while more.  It's located in old town, pretty conveniently on Scottsdale rd.  You probably have to park on the street but not a big deal.  The decor and atmosphere is set to be cozy, pretty much everything is done in either black or white.  I find it a bit pretentious but it is quite cozy, so I'll forgive them for that.  On some tables, lighting is very poor, you may have a hard time seeing your food, and the tables are a bit cramped as well.    The staff is pretty knowledgeable about their menu and the service is pretty nice.  I love their specials, typically seafood items.  First page of the menu is appetizers and pasta items, second page is veal and other meats and the third page is seafood, and that's it, simple and great.  You can try some of their appetizers but they do provide delicious bread with a pretty good herb butter.  Save some of the bread for your entree to dip into their delicious sauces.  I usually go for their veal or one of the seafood dishes.  They are all pretty good, can't go too wrong with anything, but I would stay away from the thick marinara sauce.   It's a bit overpowering for delicate seafood.  Sea bass with spinach ravioli were awesome, it's topped off with a buttery pomodoro sauce.  Another good item is the scallops, you can have it scampi style or prepared it 6 other different ways.  Veal piccata is so good, so is the veal marsala,they make it really tender.  I have experienced over cooking on some of the more tender and flaky white fish, it wasn't inedible but it could have been better.  The place is a bit pricey, but then again what seafood place isn't.  Most dishes are between 25-30 but there are alot of pasta dishes around 10-20 as well.  An adequate wine and beer list accompanies your food as well, but as usually they reflect \"scottsdale\" pricing."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star because I cannot give it zero. The most dreadful service I have EVER received. The waiter was ridiculously rude. Not only did he break every rule of serving etiquette, but he seemed to go out of his way to be disrespectful. He couldn't be bothered to give us a wine list, instead telling my cousin which wine she would want. (Which was dreadful). When I ask what he had that was very dry, he told me I'd like the Pinot Grigio because it was \"really dry and sweet\". I'm certain those two things are opposite. I did not try to correct him. I asked for the salad with dressing on the side. It came on the salad. I again did not say anything. I ordered the same dish as an other person at the table only mine was extra spicy. When I asked if mine was the spicy one, given his earlier mistake, I was admonished with \"well that's what you ordered isn't it?\". The general rudeness continued in every interaction with him until it culminated when I asked where the bathroom was. He just said \"in the back\". I asked for clarification and that's when he very condescendingly said \"oh let me lead you\". As I walked away he said, loud enough for the whole table to hear, that I was \"pretentious\".   I have never not left a tip, and was still planning on giving him the standard 20% until I heard he had said this. I left no tip, but a note recommending that he not speak poorly of patrons within ear shot of their companions. He chased me out of the restaurant, screaming at me down the side walk.  The service was so poor that even if the food had been amazing I would still give this place 1 star, but the food was mediocre at best.  Salad: just lettuce and onions Calamari: decent Garlic bread: flavorless (how is that possible?) Shrimp far diavlo: shrimp was overlooked and tough All in all, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around 36 years and the waiter built it up like it was the freshest and most homemade Italian food that me and my family would ever eat .   Well that was so wrong.  I ordered their \"signature dish\" chicken Carolina .  The chicken was boiled and bland and my sons Chicken Parmigiana was the same.  My husband was looking for an excellent homemade lasagna after rave review by waiter and was extremely disappointed .  He said he would have like a bottled Italian seasoning just to give it some flavor.  I would not recommend this place.  You'll get better flavor at Olive Garden"}
{"text":"The advertisement suggested reservations, we took a chance and arrived to an empty restaurant.  Some guy, I am guessing the owner sat us down and gave us the specials. Then came our waiter, which was very nice and pleasant.  The dinner salad was a nice size and the minestrone soup which was strongly suggested was good. The sauce on the while lasagna was bland, I couldn't add enough salt and pepper so it could taste like anything. My kid loved the spaghetti and meatballs.   Overall, the service was great., the atmosphere was classic. I am not sure if the food is worth trying again. There are so many places to eat in the area and great reviews, it makes it difficult to find a place that really has your same taste."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Was hoping for some good Italian food but instead we had rude, rushed and terrible service. Our party of eight was crammed into a small table. We asked for a larger spot, which there was, we were told was reserved.   When the food finally arrived it's was bland and tasted stale. Don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"I'm still mad that I stayed and gave them money rather than walked out. The owner/host was the poorest excuse for a restaurant worker I have ever encountered. He repeatedly yelled in customers faces and argued non-stop about everything. Insulted patrons as well as his staff and had no respect for anyone. The food was just \"eh\" I had the White Lasagna and it lacked flavor. Also, if you are going to charge $25 an entree, it would be nice to get a menu that wasn't a crumpled up piece of paper with old food stuck to it. Overall the experience was awful and we will never return."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Recommended to go here by a local and glad we did. The chicken piccata was freaking amazing, some of the best I've had. They will also make it spicy to add a little kick. Additionally, the side of pasta was fabulous, also able to add spice. It was recommended that I don't go above 2 if I'd never been here before. I took a chance at 5, and it was perfect in every flaming way. But on the edge and don't let it go down wrong or risk death by coughing. My lips are still tingling. I wouldn't want to see what 10 is like!  Atmosphere sportsy, but really cool. Owner seems like a cranky Brooklyn gypsy/pirate (in the most respectful way.) I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went just last night. No lie 28 dollars for 4 ravioli. Yes they were good but lukewarm and not enough for that ridiculous price. Bradley was waiter but didn't serve the food angry wait staff dropped in front of us. So many nice places to eat. I would not waste my time. Wish I would have thought to snap photo of the 4 lonely ravioli..."}
{"text":"This recently became my favorite Italian restaurant ever for so many more reasons than the food.   We walked in and were greeted by who I can only assume is the owner (an older Italian gentleman wearing a Yankees jersey) and seated in a booth. Frank Sinatra was singing and we were surrounded by pictures of past and present Yankees players (The Yankees are my AL team because I have a need to be severely anti-Red Sox).   Our waiter, Brandon/Meatball, was super friendly and never let my water glass get anywhere near empty. I love that.   So now on to the food, which was absolutely amazing... My mouth still waters just thinking about it. Our app of choice, garlic bread, was some of the best ever. I had the Chilean Sea Bass special - the fish  was cooked perfectly (and I'm not usually a fan of cooked fish) and the spinach ravioli it was on top of was amazingly delicious.   The only way this night could have gotten better is if I had been with a date who was drinking so that I could have drank as well. A nice white wine would have complimented the fish wonderfully.  As we were leaving, Steppenwolf started playing. How can any experience associated with a \"Magic Carpet Ride\" not get 5 stars?"}
{"text":"The owner or manager was terribly rude to my 83 year old mother when she got up the nerve to complain about her meal.  He basically said, \" well what do you want me to do about this?\" \" you ordered it!\"  Can you believe this jerk?  I wish wish wish I had read similar reviews on yelp before we sat down here. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"Ambience was amazing.  The dining room smelled fantastic.  Service was perfect (prompt and formal, yet unpretencious). We had Halibut with lemon/butter/caper sauce and Scallops over linguine.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  We were also very happy with the wine. It was a Malbec, only around $30 for the bottle, and it was great."}
{"text":"We visited on 2/10 , we called around 7 to check the wait. A very nice man said he would take our name and hold a table. When we arrived he greeted us at the door and held a beautiful table outdoors. The view and ambiance was great. Manager/owner was very pleasant and sweet. Food was good, service excellent. We were visiting  family here as we are from RHODE ISLAND.  We will absolutely be back again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it never fails to be exactly what the Dr ordered.  Eating calamari with beverages at the bar just before sunset on a beautiful late spring evening."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go when we are in Scottsdale. It's located in old Scottsdale where you could spend the day windowshopping and then having lunch or dinner here.  The menu is extensive, very authentic and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I work in television. Specifically, I work on television shows that rip managers like the one here new assholes in front of millions of people. Say what you want about Kitchen Nightmares, Bar Rescue and Kitchen Impossible, but we take people like the manager that works here and kick them to the curb where lowlifes like her belong. The only thing I can say is I WISH we were shooting this bar so I could give this bitch what she deserves. The following is a detailed encounter with the WORST MANAGER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER. Skip to the second to last paragraph if you just want the punchline. I'll understand.   I'll set the scene for you: It's a Thursday night, my crew and I are on location working on said television show in Scottsdale. My boyfriend is from New York and we were looking to catch the Knicks game. Alas, we were pointed to \"the best Italian joint in Arizona\" by a neighboring bar owner. We walk on over and set up shop in a lovely little bar, we chat it up with the Bartender, TR, he's great, welcoming, from jersey, he even shares tales of the owner's history in New York. Everything is going swimmingly, what a great night out with friends, right? We order a few appetizers  bucket of clams, bucket of mussels and 3 light beers. All delicious. Atmosphere is beautiful, great old school music, just a great New Yorker's bar.   One of our guys is an HUGE Ucla fan so of course, he brought his Ipad with him so he could stream the UCLA game. This is where shit begins to quickly go south. My friend asks the TR if he could use the wireless to stream a little better. TR kindly directs us to a heavy set, dark haired woman bundled up like she's never been in weather below 80 degrees before. My friend kindly approaches her and asks if she's the manager. Her reply: \"I don't work here\".... hmmm My friend and I are perplexed... Well that strange because  TR just said you were the manager. My friend, confused, turned to TR assuming he must have asked the wrong woman. Nope, that was her and she just told us she didn't work here. Annoyed but polite, my friend leans over to her to get her attention and confront her about saying she didn't work here. He's joking with her at first, with a smile on his face. Her quip back to my friend, no lie this is what she said, \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?\". My friend is taken back by her aggressive nature and explains all he was going to ask was if he could use the internet. She aggressively tells him she doesn't know the password and walks to the end of the bar, yells over customers to TR (the nicest bartender on the planet) not to direct customers to her and if they want internet \"THEY CAN PAY FOR 4G\"* *Personal Note: Bitch, we have 4G.  We kept our mouths shut until we finished our drinks and food. Contemplated staying because the locals at the bar acknowledged the manager is known for being a bitch. TR was so great and welcoming and apologized for her behavior. Sadly, despite TR's attempt, we had to leave out of purpose alone. We close our tab, take care of TR because he's awesome and make our way to the door.   Before making our way completely out the door, my friend leans over to the manager and QUIETLY lets her know A) She's a terrible manager and B) we're leaving because of her. That's when she literally went Cat. 5-Batshit-Crazy on us. Screaming at my friend in front of the ENTIRE Restaurant, \"DON'T POINT YOUR FINGER AT ME!!!\" \"IF YOU WEREN'T SO CHEAP TO PAY FOR 4G YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM\" We let her know politely we're leaving and she's acting crazy to her reply, \"LEAVE MOTHER FUCKERS!\" Yep. She called us mother fuckers for asking if we could use the internet. \"DON'T FUCKING COME BACK HERE YOU CHEAP ASSHOLES.\" Yep. That was another one that really stood out.   It's a shame. We roll with a crew of 60 people and every city we're in, we take over a local bar and restaurant for the 3 weeks we're in town. We understand the hospitality industry and we applaud great work and most of the time overlook bad behavior. I can honestly say I've never experienced such shocking behavior from anyone in the industry ever. I'm still completely blown away by how incredibly aggressive this woman was and how such a great place can employ such toxic behavior. I can say, despite TR's attempt to get us to come back, myself, nor anyone from our crew will bring business here while we're in town.   With Love,  K"}
{"text":"I wish I could give the Italian Grotto in Scottsdale less than one star. They really deserve a negative 10 star review. I just had the worst meal without apology. It was so bad (and cost $30 - for one meal - without drink or appetizer)  that one bite was enough. Really, looking at it was enough. The waiter didn't check on us and the managers answer to the problem was to say sorry. Not I'll get you another meal or take it off the bill or anything. Seriously it was horrendous. The service terrible and the attitude was even worse.   I feel completely violated by this place. They took a lot of money and left me hungry and feeling ripped off, completely."}
{"text":"A vacation to Arizona usually calls for some southern or mexican food in my family, but once in awhile we have our cravings from seafood, When we saw the sign of seafood pasta, we immediately thought to give it a try. Between three of us, we ordered an antipasto appetizer, two seafood pastas: one with clams and mussels, the other with scallops, and a spinach ravioli.   The antipasto was very good. It was very fabulous with lots of colors within the greens. It was refreshing, crisp, and all the flavors  in the vegetables were accented perfectly.  I did not favor our entrees. They were not the hottest, which led me to feel like I wished it had been made and delivered immediately after. I thought the quality of the seafood was great.  We were given tiramisu on the house which is what these three stars refer to. The tiramisu was beyond excellent. I would suggest skipping the entree and just getting the dessert when you visit. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"My daughter-in-law (who is of black descent) and I were enjoying the Art Walk last night. Having been to the Italian Grotto in the past where I've enjoyed the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere surrounded by sounds of Italian accents. She loves the Italian culture, so for all these reasons, we stopped in for a glass of wine. Within moments, the bartender threw down her driver's license, expressing his dismay about \"the Jersey people.\" Not a huge deal; perhaps this is just one of those people with a dry, crass sense of humor. Being from Jersey himself, my daughter-in-law tried to engage him in a friendly conversation about West Orange and East Orange. He interrupted, and negated this with, \"No. The blacks are from....\" The blacks. This all happened within minutes of sitting down, and this exchange made me extremely uncomfortable.   I won't patronize this establishment, nor recommend it, as I have no tolerance for prejudice, ignorance, or absence of tact. I hope this review helps with some positive change."}
{"text":"Food was excellent !!!  Just as I remembered!  The server was not good at all!  After not going there for about a year. I was in the area with family from out of town and had raved about the restaurant! Instantly they were turned off by the server bob's attitude!  We pressed through dinner and thank goodness for Paul the bus guy!"}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars if i could. We came to eat there lunch, a family with two little kids, and the doorman gave us a bad filling from the beginning. After we entered and looked for a menu, the host man start yelling on us and literally kicked us out of the restaurant because we didn't ordered fast enough. He added: i don't want to give you service. Get the hell out of here.\" We went in shock and went to eat somewhere else. Never had such a bad experience."}
{"text":"What a great time!  I came here for a Birthday party with about a dozen friends last Monday night. A nearby Giants Spring Training Game had just concluded so we were very fortunate to have had reservations. Apparently this is a favorite spot for baseball fans as evidenced by the sports themed décor.  The place was packed and teeming with activity. You would expect with all that chaos the service would be a bit sketchy, and understandably so.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Before we had a chance to sit down our server came by to take our drink orders.  All evening long, that same server was spot on. He was taking 6-7 customized orders at a time returning in less than 5 minutes with everyone's drinks.  I also noticed a large 10 top cleared out right next to our table and I saw a bartender, the owner, our server and a busboy all over there cleaning everything up and re-arranging the tables for the next guests. Amazing teamwork.   The food was very good.  All of the appetizers were great, particularly the fried calamari with spicy marinara sauce.  The regular bread in a basket was a bit dry for my taste (I prefer more chewy as opposed to flaky and crunchy), but their garlic bread was pure heaven.  For my main course I had the spaghetti with meatballs, one of the best in recent memory.  It had just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Had early dinner.  DBacks playoff game underway which drew everyone's attention.  Service was very food and food was great."}
{"text":"Cool spot to hang out.  Very sports grill-ish considering it's in downtown Scottsdale... I didn't expect it.  San Francisco giants all over the walls... Pizza wafts out the door... Black and shiny interior that just glints as you come in. Massive wall of alcohol.  Seems pretty laid back.   With this one, I also didn't have the food.  I really friggen wanted to tho... the pizza smelled AWESOME."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon. There was no wait. Easy to get seated.  The service was good. I was served a starter of bread with butter that I swear had bacon blended in.   The fried artichokes were simply delicious. And very hearty. I could have eaten this alone and been happy.   There is a small outdoor area. Which gives you a good view to be able to people watch or to have people watch you eat. And indoors the decor was filled with sports memorabilia. The bar area had TV's for your viewing pleasure.   All in all, not a bad little place.   *note the woman's restroom was pretty clean too*"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this slum hole has a three star rating. I and many others would probably view it as a negative 3 star. All of the 5 star reviews are fake, there's no other explanation. Appetizers were over priced for the portions served. Pasta was over cooked however, our server Jason was fantastic. I wouldn't recommend this place to even my worst enemy, it has by far the worst host. He was rude and disrespectful to my entire party. He told my aunt, \"get of my face\" \"I'm not talking to you\" \"leave\" \" we're done, bye\". For a host such as himself & the over priced meals I don't recommend going here! Seriously save your time & money. Your better off eating at in & out."}
{"text":"Horrible service and fraud.  There were hardly any people in the restaurant and they still took way too long to bring our food out and couldn't even get the bill right by \"accidentally\" overcharging for items that we ordered and including items on our bill that we never ordered.  Given that I had to deal with them through our whole poor experience, I did not believe that any gratuity was warranted.  Hence, I signed the credit card bill for the amount of our final corrected check without including any amount for gratuity.  What was processed through the restaurant to the bank was for $20 more.  Sure when I called the bank they took care of it but what these clowns need to work on more is how to improve their service instead of fraudulently mischarging customers for their horrible service!"}
{"text":"BEWARE:  We had the misfortune to patronize this loud, over rated restaurant,  the minestrone is Chunky and not very tasty the salad was just that, salad.  We ordered the calamari which wasn't too bad, but where was the rest of the order?  The scampi was tough, overcooked, pasta al dente?  The sauce was something, don't know what it was supposed to be.  Not even a small piece of French bread on the table?  We aren't drinkers, so had ginger ales.  Maybe that's the reason we were Rushed out? The waiter never asked us if we needed anything else, if the meal was good, etc. just threw the totaled bill on the table in passing,  the Rude owner/maitre d passed our table and we said we'd like the dessert menu.  He said our bill was already totaled, to pay it because he needed our table for  people in line. NEVER, NEVER, have we Ever been asked to leave our table, much less to accommodate other diners.  This person is the rudest excuse for an owner/patron of a business we've ever encountered.  We live in the S.F. Peninsula area where we have many upscale restaurants.  We also know our Italian dishes.  These lack any inspiration.  The chef just wants to serve as quickly as possible, didn't even detect any herbs.  Guess they depend on us using salt and pepper for some flavor, You know, if the service and ambiance is great, most of us won't complain about the food.  But, this place misses the boat in every way. Save your money.    $77.+ for 2 pasta dished, 2 ginger ales and a Small order of calamari.  And, Oh yes, plan to be tossed out if there's a line waiting to eat!   Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Friday night with girlfriends during a girls' weekend.  Overall, the service was pretty decent. Our waiter was a little odd behaving, but certainly friendly.   I like the atmosphere of Italian Grotto. It's not too spendy, I love that the walls open up onto the sidewalk allowing for fun people watching. The last time I was there with my husband we sat at the bar and enjoyed watching some sports on tv while we drank and noshed.  This is a welcoming place to go when you want something fun and not too too god damned fancy,  I knocked off two stars for a couple reasons. I made reservations a couple weeks in advance and nevertheless we were given a crap table by the kitchen. We could have waited for another table, but we were hungry and wanted to get on with our evening. If you have a reservation on the books, try giving a non-reservation party the table by the kitchen and save that upfront table for the people who called ahead. Also, our waiter seemed a little out of it...despite the fact he was friendly he just didnt always seem lucid. He had a hard time keeping our order straight both forgetting one entire entree and refusing to split our entrees between three people (although he happily split them between two?).  The price for a bottle of Veuve was extremely fair. $90."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd trip to the Italian Grotto, I live in old town and try to support the locals.  Both times were week days and the place was pretty quiet, we were seated right away and both the waiter (Brandon) and the owner were very nice.  I had the chicken fontina and my friend had the chicken benito, both were excellent.  Brandon was very attentive and made sure our wine glasses were full.  It was my friends birthday and Brandon gave us a free dessert, which was also very good.    The owner is sometimes a little loud, but has never been rude.  I think it might be the east coast thing.  All in all, the prices were good, food was awesome, and our service both times has been exceptional.  I love it when the windows are open!!    Oh, I did hear they were trying to make some sort of patio.  Which would be dog friendly,  yuck, I don't like dining with animals.  So we'll see...."}
{"text":"I was recently in Old town Scottsdale and was looking for a restaurant that would allow me to bring my dog as the hotel I was staying in would not let me leave him in the room if I was not there. After walking around old town doing some shopping I was ready for a nice meal. It was a beautiful night and I came across this restaurant. I spotted a waiter and asked if I could sit outside with my dog. He said no problem, so we were seated and immediatly he brought over some dog cookies to win over my pup. I ordered the Chilian Bass which was awesome, then followed it with ricotto filled cannoli. My waiter Pedro was very attentive and seeing I was alone made sure to come over to check on me often even bought me a glass of wine. I will definetly visit again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The setting and food were great. The male server could learn to be a little friendlier. When he brought back our change instead if handing it to us he threw it on the table."}
{"text":"We walked in with twelve guests including five young kids. Server Brandon was very patient with us. The food is nice - our kids often refused food but with this restaurant, they ate all the angel hair pasta we ordered. The soup was also very nice."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed. Waited for a while to get a table. Finally got a spot and the server was clearly annoyed we were not drinking alcohol with our meal.   We ordered traditional spaghetti and meatballs that was pretty standard. We also ordered fish that was way over cooked. Great location but just not the best experience."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: This restaurant has the rudest staff of any restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life.   I came here on a beautiful New Years Day afternoon, with my boyfriend and my dog. Before sitting down, I asked one of the servers on staff if it was alright for me to have my dog sit down by our table while we ate. She's fifteen years old and was on a leash at the time, which I explicitly said. He said it was absolutely fine, no problems whatsoever, so I went to seat myself at the very end of the patio, furthest away from all the other tables so as to not disturb any other guests who might come along - it was totally empty.  About fifteen minutes later, while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, I gave my mom a quick call since she was wondering what time we'd be getting done eating. In the middle of my conversation with her, I heard someone talking loudly and aggressively next to me, so I looked over, and he was staring angrily at me. I asked him what he had said, and he acted like I had affronted him. So he even more angrily boomed, \"I SAID GET OFF YOUR PHONE, NOW. AND MOVE YOUR DOG, NOW. PLEAAASE.\" I was utterly confused, not just by his psychotic rudeness, but by what he meant by that. My dog was laying at my feet under the table, not in anyone's way at all. He started talking about how it was HIS table and HIS chair and I had better get off the phone and was waving his hands and pointing at the chair where I had tethered her leash, all while my mom was talking to me in my ear. Very disorienting. But finally I understood that he wanted me to tether her to a different chair, even though there were 40 other empty chairs around us he could have used to seat the couple instead. In fact, the table they were being seated at already had two chairs. Bizarre.  I very calmly told him that he didn't have to speak so rudely. He starting going off about how I have no idea what I'm talking about and I don't respect anyone else's space and I was taking up two tables and it's his chair so he can tell me what to do with it. Since I had finally hung up, it clicked, \"Oh, this is your restaurant?\" I was totally baffled how someone who actually wanted to run a successful establishment would treat his customers like common criminals. \"YES, MA'AM. MINE.\" That was all I needed to hear. We immediately left.  I'm in total shock. This guy has an axe to grind with his customers."}
{"text":"We ate here prior to reading any reviews. I must say I was surprised by the negative reviews.  We arrived and were promptly seated for five. The wait staff even pulled out the table so we could ease into our table.  Our server was Harvey and he made every effort to keep us well watered and fed. We started with house bread which came with butter and I think seasoned cream cheese (or butter) with sun dried tomatoes. Altogether I'd say we had four servings of bread.  Next came clams in portofino sauce. That was promptly scarfed down by our youngest.  Then came mozzarella marinara. Each piece was individually served.  My wife had chicken Carolina, the daughter garlic and butter spaghetti, and the sons pasta bolognese and fettuccine Alfredo.  I had the eggplant Parmesan. It's weird that it has mushrooms but you can't even taste them. But you can feel the texture. And it was great.  We were hungry but left full. Only regret was we had no room for dessert.  I won't mind coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I am using the Yelp star rating less and less - and the Italian Grotto is a perfect example of why.  When in Scottsdale a few weeks ago I asked a couple long time residents working at Don & Charlies where else they suggest going for dinner when I was coming back in a couple weeks with my wife.  2 of the 3 mentioned the Italian Grotto as another old school Scottsdale place with local flavor and good food.  Checking the Yelp reviews it seems a lot of people have bad service.  What I have found is that I rarely get bad service, so I always discount those reviews.  So I went ahead and made a reservation for the following Saturday night after our Spring training game.  I am glad I did.    In summary - we were seated at the time of our reservation, the waiter was great (well spoken, friendly, informative, and prompt), our table was good, the food/wine was very good, and the prices fairly reasonable.  I would recommend this place, except maybe during the 3rd weekend of Spring Training (the busiest weekend).  More details follow ... Due to an incident my wife had at the ball game, I called in the afternoon and asked if we could move the reservation back from 7:00 to 8:00 pm - the gruff sounding owner answered and took care of it.  We showed up at 7:45 to find a line of people waiting.   I slipped past them and waited patiently for someone to assist me - they were very busy so it took a few minutes.  Finally the owner came by, I mentioned the reservation, and he confirmed we would be seated shortly.  Meanwhile several people in line were glaring at me and made comments to my wife about me \"cutting in line\".    The owner was seating the first family in line when 3 guys brushed past everyone, walked in, looked around, and sat at an empty table by the bar area.  When the owner saw that he asked them to move since the table was for people waiting in line.  We could see the discussion from the door and the entitled young men were not leaving easily.  The men finally got up and stood in the bar area right by the same table.    Starting to see a trend here?  A few minutes later the owner motioned to the next couple in line and seated them at that table,  He then motioned to us and sat us in a booth nearby.  As we were being seated, there were more comments from those waiting in line who had no reservations - \"how come they got a table\", etc.  People - make a f'ing reservation!  From our small booth we could see the front dining room and bar area as well as into the back dining room.  The place was packed with every table filled.  Service was humming and our waiter gave us the proper amount of attention.  We could see the 3 guys who were evicted from the table they illegally claimed - they were standing right next to the table and bumping the woman who was seated at the table.  She eventually moved to the other side of the table.  There were many other examples of poor behavior by customers that I won't bother you with.  Our waiter gave us recommendations on the wine and food - we listed to some of them and were not disappointed.  The food we got was delicious.  The wine was perfect.  The service was good.  The waiter answered all of our questions and was quite helpful.  At the end of the night I showed him my wallet - a cool one my wife found in NY years ago that has an old picture of downtown Scottsdale.  Our waiter identified the buildings on it for us and pointed out that the edge of the restaurant was right at the edge of the picture.  He knew the area well and grew up around there.  So in summary, it would have been a wonderful night if it weren't for the entitled people who came to Scottsdale for Spring training that think they can do what they want, eat at busy restaurants with out reservations, and be rude to others because as one guy that night put it \"I spent over $1000 to come here for the weekend.\"  So I would highly recommend coming here - I would just avoid the middle of March - when to bozos come out to play.  I rate the 4.5 stars - rounding up to 5 to slightly counteract the \"bad service\" reviews by people who seem to attract bad service."}
{"text":"Went to the Italian Grotto for lunch on a Saturday. Had appetizers. Then ordered food to go. Ordered scampi scallops for $26.00 got 4 scallops in a foam carton unsealed & leaked all over. $26.00 REALLY  FOR 4 SCALLOPS! RIP OFF! I don't care if it's Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great caprese salad. Our seafood medley was excellent.  The marinara sauce and cream sauce was extremely tasty.  The chicken parmesan and chicken beneto Were also very tasty.  The malbec by the glass was also very good.  Great location in old Scotsdale. We finished dinner and walked to Scotsdale Stadium to watch  a great Fall league game betwen the Scorpions and the Javelina's!"}
{"text":"My first time in Old Scottsdale and the first restaurant I tried. My in-laws are first generation Itslian and the food here is the real deal. The Chilean Sea Bass with ravioli was perfect!  The fried zucchini was great. The true test came when I ordered the cannoli. It was truly Italian and huge - easily enough for 2. There regulars eating at the bar - was a cozy, fun environment. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a nice dinner outside however when I went to use the bathroom the owner stopped me  and told me I had  90 seconds to use the bathroom. He had two girls bang in the door. I told him he owed me a apology and he called me a nasty name. He was very rude and I would never go back. I would have called the police but I was visiting my very ill brother. Please don't go here. He should be shut down. We spent 60 dollars and this is how he treats his customers. I hope this post stops people from eating there and he shuts down."}
{"text":"We went there during the summer time which is like and off season for that side of town. The ambiance is just horrible there. Its too dark and the color scheme is bad. The food is literally nasty and is way overpriced. I don't even remember who waited on us because they were never around to ask how was the food or a refill.  This place needs to get Chef Gordon Ramsey to help them out. LOL!"}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious. We had the salmon Cesar salad, halibut pomodoro with home made ravioli, and fried artichokes. Everything was wonderfully prepared. Love it! Can't forget the \"better than my own grandmothers\" minestrone soup. (She just rolled over in her grave, but it's the truth)."}
{"text":"We had a mediocre dinner tonight. I have been here before but after tonight, we won't be returning. The salad was just OK. Lettuce with a ton of blue cheese dressing that tasted like sour cream. The entree of halibut was good. The waiter apparently didn't like the tip our host gave him. He came back and asked if the service was OK. Then whispered something rude in our host's ear. As we were exiting the table made a big deal of saying \"You can't believe this table\" to one of his coworkers. Then followed my 84 year old Mom and I and told us he only got a 10% tip. Tips are DISCRETIONARY for one thing and we had no control over that. Classless! If you want real Italian food served by polite people in a relaxed atmosphere, go to Tommy V's and forget this place."}
{"text":"The worst customer experience ever!!! For such a small place, you would think they'd care about keeping patrons happy. But our waiter was rude and impersonal and the owner approached the table and was even worse!! Would not recommend. Spend your $$$$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"The worse service we ever had. Whoever reads the reviews on this restaurant do not go there. Long story short we were celebrating a birthday. There was 6 of us. The waiter was so rude. The manager was horrible.  She looked like she just rolled out of bed.  It was disgusting. I can't believe they are still in business. We got thrown out of the restaurant. She offered to write the review for us. I won't even give them 1 star. They need to learn some customer service. Stay away."}
{"text":"I love this old school Italian restaurant. Great food with many choices. Gary, the owner is a cool dude. Sports focused plaice... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in old town!   I feel personally insulted that this bigot is occupying this dining space in the heart of our town. His food and moral demeanor are unacceptable.  City inspector will be called very soon. There are so many welcoming, clean, and delicious places to grab a bite to eat... This place needs to go!! ASAP!"}
{"text":"Romantic cozy Italian restaurant in the heart of old town, a little on the dated side of things. This place reminds me of Bautistia's hole in the wall in Vegas. They  have cioppinio!!! I never have left here hungry or not thoroughly entertained.  Great food, great wine selection and the people watching is awesome on the patio.  I passed by this place so many times... this is a great place to eat, don't need to get all fancy for and has great servers."}
{"text":"While we went to Old Town Arizona and were a little bored. We stopped in the Italian Grotto and had so much fun we couldn't wait to get back. Besides the Owner being a character and charming the food  was outrageously good. It was like being in Ny . The Chicken piccata  was tender and full of flavor , and the drinks were REAL  drinks. Great bartenders as well . We stayed for over 3 hours and watched the sports with all the guys at the bar. Great place to come if your on business.. Well be back for sure"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Terrific food. Fun location in the heart of old town. But tonight (after coming here for more than 20 years) the service was AWFUL!!  Wait staff should check in with diners at least once in a while. At least keep drinks refilled and make sure all is ok after each course is delivered. Tonight we were totally ignored. No checking back at all. To add insult to injury, when the poor service was pointed out to both the owner and waiter they each argued with us. Busy night (and it wasn't). They were keeping an eye on the table even without asking if anything was needed (and it was needed and this nonverbal thing did NOT work). We got what we needed (owner brought drinks since waiter hadn't stopped by). What happened to customer service?!  And we heard both the waiter and owner arguing with other diners."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here.  There are tons of great bars and restaurants in Old Town, places where they treat customers with respect and appreciate your business.  People have had good things to say about the food, but I couldn't tell you because I was not allowed to spend my money here.  I would certainly never come back to this place ever again.  We walked into the restaurant, and headed towards the bar which is in the back because I didn't see anyone up front who looked like they worked there.  I lagged a little behind my wife because I was looking for someone who worked there because there we're a several empty tables.  Next thing I know, my wife is being \"escorted\" out by some old guy and I hear \"Restrooms are for customers only\". I'm a little confused, and I say I was heading for the bar, to which he replies \"Not in here you're not. GO somewhere else.\" in a loud voice. At this point I was not even sure he worked there, because he was dressed casual and not like any of the employees I saw in the 30 seconds or so we'd been in the place. So he is pushing my wife out, not physically but by crowding her towards the door ranting \"It's not right\" over and over at a high volume.  I'm like, What just happened. I try to have a conversation with the guy outside, but just continues screaming at us.  Some guy comes up and blocks the owner and keeps telling me to \"walk away man\".  Not once did I ever raise my voice, despite being pretty angry at the treatment.  I am like, I am just trying to talk to the man to figure out what the heck just happened, and he keeps telling me to walk away. At his point I've realized the guy yelling at me is probably the owner.  We we walk around the block, and I go back into the restaurant because I'd like to address the disrespect my wife received. Again no one is up front so I wait.  A couple of minutes the owner or whomever comes from the back and asks if he can help me.  I'm thinking, you don't recognize me?  I mean if it were me, Id remember the appearance of someone I was shouting at, kicking of my restaurant, and yelling at on the sidewalk 15 minutes before, but apparently this must happen pretty often to not be memorable.  So I calmly say \"I'd like to have an adult conversation about what just happened.\"  Then the lightbulb goes on, and he mutters \"I don't want to talk to you\", proceeds to brush past me and walks outside.  Note he didn't even kick me out, he just pushed passed me and left, leaving me standing in the restaurant.  So I follow outside and ask very calmly \"Can I just talk to you for a second.\"  He starting into another tantrum standing on the sidewalk, saying \"I tried being nice, and it doesn't work\" over and over. At first I thought he might be drunk, based on his behavior and belligerent actions.  I can't be sure, but I honestly think this is just his personality, which in some ways is worse.  So he's got his back to me, and so I turn to leave and say something along the lines of \"Man, I've never been kicked out of someplace for walking up the bar.\".  So he yells at my back \"You don't just walk into a place!\"  I'm like, yeah you do, pretty much every restaurant I've ever been to.  If there is a host or hostess you say \"heading to the bar\"; and if not you just take an open barstool.  I've certainly never been removed from an establishment for simply walking in;  actually this the first time I've ever been removed, ever.  So the sad thing is, we aren't even tourists, were locals.  I'll be sure to let me friends know to stay clear of here."}
{"text":"Lunch prices were very high and he portions were small. What appeared to be the owner was very rude and made us very uncomfortable. If it had not been for the fact that we already ordered food, we would have left. I would never recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite Italian Restaurant in Scottsdale! Not only is the food absolutely amazing, but the staff is friendly, professional and goes above and beyond to make us feel like family! If you are in the area, come by for a fantastic meal and make new friends!  To MEATBALL, Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. We were seated immediately around 1:15 on a Friday which was nice. Our waiter was texting like crazy which was not. Then we watched him get into his car and drive away. The salad lettuce was limp and the bread pretty much made our mouths bleed. We ordered the Fettucini Alfredo, cannelloni, and the manicotti verde. The crepes in the cannelloni were very rubbery and the filling lacked flavor. Our server was and the owner was not here. However we spoke to the manager and she took care of our entire meal which was nice but didn't make up for the terrible experience."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a special event. Decided on Grotto because of the reviews but couldn't be disappointed more. Rude and disrespectful owner/server who was very judgmental. We ended up leaving due to his demeanor and treatment. Want a similar experience? Make reservations and enter at  your own risk."}
{"text":"Place was dark and dreary- seemed old and outdated. They still write out your bill by hand. Food was horrendous- tasteless, clearly defrosted food, food from a can. Service was tolerable. I regret spending money to eat here."}
{"text":"This area is so packed, especially after a spring training game! I should have been weary when I was able to get a table here so quickly while the other places I wanted to check out had an hour plus wait time. I was on a schedule so had no choice.  I really went back and forth with the star rating. I enjoyed my main dish but service was horrible and my experience was ruined multiple times.  We started with wine and had to wait so long to even get the wine list, like c'mon how many times do I have to ask for it? We were looking at the menu and our server asked if we would like Garlic Toast. Sure why not we could use something to munch on while we waited for our food. He never mentioned it was a charged item, he made it seem like do you want water and bread that comes complimentary. So that was an awkward shock when the bill came. Especially when it was so tiny yet still like $9. I try to always get something new or something I can't get back home so when I saw the white Lasagna, I knew I had to order it. Picture this ribbons of noodles layered with ricotta cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and cream, then baked with mozzarella cheese. So much yum! It was in fact delicious, tiny but delicious! Our waiter was hanging out with other patrons and ignoring us so we skipped on ordering dessert. I overheard others complaining so it's not a one time thing.  This place has so much potential and is in such an ideal location!  Keep in mind on the patio you are subject to homeless asking for food or money and the drunken debauchery of tourists on vacation. Makes for great people watching but I could see some uncomfortable guests nearby. Don't leave your purse on your chair for sure!"}
{"text":"Surprised by the mixed reviews of the Gratto in Scottsdale. We were walking through Old Towne searching for something to eat for dinner and the smell of butter and garlic pulled us in as if we were in a trance.   The owner was very friendly when he greeted us at the door. The restaurant and bar were busy but seating was immediately available. And despite the fact the place was packed full of Giant fans the vibe was upbeat, pleasant and a place I could see revisiting on future trips to Scottsdale.   We started with some garlic bread and Minestrone. You better be a fan of garlic to enjoy the garlic bread. It was a bit overwhelming, but being a fan of the flavorful bulb this did not deter me from eating almost half a loaf. The soup was smooth. A nice tomato base with noodles, veggies and beans. It was not in itself something to write home about but provided a nice start to our meal.   For the main course we had Scallop Scampi and Cippiano. Both dishes surpassed expectations. The seafood was fresh and tender. Pasta was a perfect al dente and again there was not a lack of butter and garlic complementing the shellfish and pasta.   Dinner with drinks was a bit pricy but it's vacation. We enjoyed the meal and will certainly return on our next trip to the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"Wow!  Came from Seattle and heard about this place!  BEST lasagna ever!!  Staff is better than ever!"}
{"text":"Absolutely by far the best Italian closest to NY!  Love the food, the staff and the owner!  When you are here, you feel at home and always have a great time and the food is delicious!  Don't forget to order the fried zucchini and anything else on the menu, you can't go wrong!  Definitely a place to make a drive to multiple times a week!  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Definition of SUCKS in the dictionary is The Italian Grotto. Now I've come for years, but food quantity has diminished of late and they have earned the coveted FRANK B middle finger award.  I've dined on any items throughout the years and my father keeps insisting on eating at this rat hole.   (Oh Cheers to the person who posted cockroach  photo, you rule!)  Today is the last time I set foot in this dump. My meal today was Sausage Parmigiana with spaghetti. So I get tiny slivers of uncocked sausage with a dab of marinara and some cheese ( and not even a full link if that). For $21 I should have gotten two links and cooked with cheese baked on. The spaghetti was cold and I'm basically put my napkin on it and didn't eat it.  So FRANK is pissed off and hungry.   In the past the food was OK but this owner claiming to be from NYC should really go back to LITTLE ITALY and learn how to cook Italian food. John's on 12th is a good place for him to be a busboy to the Restraunt business."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really nice here.. They had Frank Sinatra playing, leather seated and dim lights.. I went there with my parents, but I would definitely consider this for my next date spot.. The food was really good and the waiter was very professional and curtious.. I would definitely recommend this resteraunt if you're looking for a really nice dinner spot.. The special ran about $32 dollars, which is a little pricy for a pasta dish, but the meal was good."}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas Eve dinner and had a really good time/meal. It's pretty stock Italian fare but serves it's purpose and we were happy they were open past 8 o'clock. Service was attentive and friendly, and the restaurant itself has a nice vibe."}
{"text":"It has been so long since I have had a meal that was perfect. Scallops on point, pasta aldente, amazing."}
{"text":"This place was a perfect place to end our stay in Scottsdale.   Preface: On NYE we were looking for a place to eat. This place was booked. The owner suggested a place that he thought would be good for our party. We went there and it was.   We (6) went for a nice dinner. We were seated quickly and service was immediate. The server suggested wines and appetizers .  The calamari was cooked perfectly with a spicy marinara sauce. The fried artichoke again perfect with an Alfredo sauce. Because of the size of our party he made each 1 1/2 the size.  We had 5 different meals so we could sample each other's food. He split one chicken dish for $5 and each got their own salad. Each was prepared to our liking - fish, 2 chicken, 1 shrimp , 1 Ravioli (this could have been bigger).  Too full for desert we ordered one to split. This turned into 3 to share (for no extra cost)        We asked for the owner to thank him for the recommendation and a great experience here. We had a great conversation. He ended up sending over his special cordial for us.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, OMG..,  anytime I'm in Phoenix I will be eating here....  Chilean Sea Bass was the best Sea Bass I've ever had...  The service was great..."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant dinner here very unexpected. We dropped in taking a chance on some good Italian food and we were not disappointed. The place is old school, traditional mafioso Italian. Food was reasonably priced and good,  service very prompt, and atmosphere - fun."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so rudely in any restaurant (including fast food places) as I was here. The waiter was completely irritated by every question we asked. He gave responses like, \"We don't do that.\" with no explanation or apology. Once we were finished eating, we paid our bill (which had undeserved gratuity added in) and were chatting for a few minutes. Within 10 minutes the manager came over and asked us to leave because he had \"people waiting on the sidewalk\". The food was decent but certainly not worth enduring the awful service. I will never return and will tell everyone I know that there are so many better places to eat in Scottsdale. Cannoli was good but way overpriced at $8."}
{"text":"There is no better Italian in Scottsdale.  Service is awesome, the atmosphere is the best.  Been a long time customer.  Highly recommended, locals and visitors."}
{"text":"By far the WORST dining experience I have ever had. I have never been treated more rudely. Came here today with my family to have a nice lunch while out shopping in Old Town. Three of my family members ordered the Baked Ravioli, I ordered the Manicotti, and two others got Fettucini Alfredo, and Spaghetti with Marinara. We were not given any bread, so we ordered some garlic toast for $6. Each of our lunch plates cost $8 each, and were a la carte. When our food came out, everything looked fine except for the ravioli. There were literally 4 pieces of ravioli on one plate. 4 small pieces of ravioli for $8. That's not enough food for one person. We had to make an extra order of the garlic toast for another $6 so the ones who ordered ravioli could have some extra food. I got two pieces of Manicotti, which was okay. My sister was upset, and decided to talk to management about the portion sizes. The owner of the restaurant came out, started YELLING, and saying that she didn't care, and that if she comped meals of everyone who complained to her, she'd be out of business. WOW. My sister said that they should make people aware of how many pieces of ravioli come on the plate, and she said, \"We never tell people that. You guys actually got two pieces of Manicotti and you were only supposed to get one, so that should make up for it.\" We were all very calm, and she kept raising her voice and being completely rude. She doesn't care about customer service. My family was visiting from out of town and this was our last day to spend together. We were just trying to have a nice lunch. We weren't asking for a refund, we just thought it would be nice if they could give more ravioli to the ones who ordered that, or at least comp the garlic toast we had to order just to give us more food. We paid $80 for that meal and everyone was still hungry when we left! They also told us after the fact that they normally give free bread before the meal, but they didn't do it for us. I have never been treated so rudely or had an experience like this before, especially not from the owner of the restaurant. I've eaten at plenty of restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale and never had an experience like this. I guess I will stick with Grimaldi's that's right down the road. Better food, and better portions, and the staff and owners are friendly and care about their customers and repeat business. Diana, you should be ASHAMED of yourself and the way you run your restaurant. That's exactly why on the day after Christmas, at the lunch hour, that your restaurant was mostly empty. The food wasn't even good enough for the prices you are charged. I've had better food at Olive Garden, and that's sad."}
{"text":"On the disappointment scale, Italian Grotto ranks right up there with my never getting laid by my first girlfriend, whom I now know twenty years later is a lesbian.  Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara.  The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat. The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown. This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it?  I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving.  I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes. Another huge disappointment. It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce. I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off.  I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally!  I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at $12.95. The only thing good about this place was nothing.   I suspect they've remained in business all these years primarily due to their location, and all the unknowing tourists.  Never going back."}
{"text":"awesome ,just awesome. Scallops bigger than my face are found here. Fresh fish. great staff. My last meal during Spring Training was here and it may have been my greatest"}
{"text":"So I went there a little while back with a group of friends just for a few drinks and appetizers. It was a quaint little hole in the wall that really gave off a nice vibe. The owner even walked by and said hi. That is always a plus in my book when they believe in investing just a few moments for everyone that walks through their doors. The cocktails were well prepared. The food was pretty tasty as well, my only complaint was the amount of grease on some of the plates. I love eating, but not drinking all the grease from the friers. Other than that, no complaints. If I am ever in that area and feel the need for filling Italian, I'm sure I'll pop in."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience at Italian Grotto was memorable and absolutely worth the wait, 20-30mins.  First we were greeted by a character of a man who I later learned was the owner. He personal sits everyone who comes into his restaurant and is just a really interesting guy. My friends and I were waiting for a table and were eventually seated at \"The WORST table EVER!\" called this by the owner. At first we were a little weirded out that we were almost guests with another table, but once we introduced ourselves and got through the formalities all went well. And we got to see what they ordered, which made it easier for us to order.  Oh and lets not forget that the Owner paid for our desserts, because we were at \"The WORST table EVER\" which the owner yelled at us each time he passed! What's better than great food, but great food an entertainment too! OK the FOOD was very very good. The Caesar salad was just Meh...but the Calamari with a spicy marinara was DELISH! And the Mussels Portifino we exceptional. The mussels were so tender they melted in your mouth. The Shrimp Franchaise, was superb! Don't forget the best Tiramisu I have had in a really long time! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"How can a waiter/bartender at an Italian restaurant NOT know what pasta aglio e olio is??  Murphy, at the bar didn't. I ordered the chicken parm work the pasta aglio e olio and he gave me confused look and said \"huh????\"  I explained it to him and he said,  \"so you want chicken parm with no marinara?\"  No!  Chicken parm comes with marinara,  i want the chicken parm as usual,  i want the pasta aglio e olio.  When he brought it out the pasta wad loaded with marinara.  He told me he had the cooks add the marinara on top of the olive oil.    Not knowing what aglio e olio is in an Italian restaurant is like not knowing what fries ate in a burger joint.    The food was ok, minestrone soup wad kind of bland, entrée wad actually decent,  even with the fiasco. I would not go back"}
{"text":"We had eaten dinner already and were discussing dessert options when we walked by this restaurant. The patio looked nice, so my husband said, how about some Tiramisu and coffee. We asked at the front if it was OK to just get coffee and dessert and the guy looked around and gave us a \"yeah, whatever\" sort of statement and pointed us to the patio. The coffee was old and burned... tarry. The tiramisu was probably the worst tiramisu I've ever had. Then we got the bill for $26??? Our fault for not looking at the menu. But what a rip off. It is one thing to pay upwards of 13$ for a coffee and dessert that tastes good at a nice restaurant. But definitely not worth it for old coffee and stale probably store bought tiramisu."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with my daughter here tonight. Great service by very professional and accommodating wait staff. Soup was delicious as was my chicken parm...so huge, I couldn't finish it. Yay! I get lunch tomorrow!    Brandon was our server. I totally felt catered too. Not cheap, but well,worth it   Loved the atmosphere and the funny owner. He wasn't bad at all. Relax people, it takes all kinds to spin this great  world. He was funny and sccommodating."}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood fettuccine and I bit into rotten mussles! This smelled horrible, so I told my server and he didn't even apologize. I then asked to speak to a manager and she told me that rotten mussles were normal to have in the dish from time to time! I will never be back. Don't go here unless your a fan of having to inspect your food to make sure it hasn't gone rotten! The blond female manager also was terrible and had horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Best meatballs in the world? Tough to tell because my pasta was full of water. I rule is never give a second chance when this happens.  I love the authenticity if the joint just not the food"}
{"text":"Will never be back. Look up the definition of rude and you will see a picture of the owner! I have never been so disrespected by someone...so much so that I heard what he said AFTER I left and I stopped my shopping trip and went back to confront him!!!"}
{"text":"Went back to Grotto for the first time in many years.  I was a fan then, I still am.  The restaurant is loud.  It's crowded.  And the food is good.  We started with mussels portifino (a white wine and garlic broth).  I liked that the dish was available in two sizes, the small being perfect for an app for two.  A little more bread to soak up the broth would have been nice, though.  I also had a special of sea bass over ravioli topped with marinara.  I liked all the components except I never seem to learn I'm not so big on seafood with marinara.  The sea bass was a generous portion, and cooked perfectly, as was the ravioli.  I had a little bit of plate envy over my husband's halibut with a lemon butter sauce.  I had this dish the last time and loved it!  Service was average.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but not really friendly.  He oddly never made eye contact (not sure if he was always looking at something/someone else or just weird) and he rattled off the specials way too quickly.   Certainly not bad enough to deter me from going again.  But someone remind me not to order seafood in red sauce!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service, unimpressive atmosphere and over priced food. The older blonde manager and our server did not appear to enjoy their occupation and with a forced 20 % gratuity tip, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Easy access in great old town Scottsdale location. Parking can be tough if you go late. Got seated right away. Waiters and host very friendly like seeing an old friend each time you go there.  Restaurant is small and NY Italian style food. Service fast friendly and full size portions. Great authentic Italian dishes and appetizers. They pour long drinks and waiters try to be fun and will drink with you. Try the calamari, all pastas, meatball and sausage dishes. All winners. Great experience and mid to upper price range and worth it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The sleazy old man who owns or runs this place took one look at me wearing my Los Angeles Dodgers jersey and literally physically blocked me from entering the restaurant. You can tell this guy cares more about his pride than customers. He was rude, disrespectful, and lost a customer. I headed to Brat Haus and order from that trusty place instead  Don't waste your time with this place, there are better Italian choices in Old Town"}
{"text":"We have been to the Grotto many times. Food is incredible....service is between good and great; depends on the server. The fish specials are flavorful, pasta dishes enormous, wine selection expansive....the entire place breaths Italian; Brooklyn style!"}
{"text":"I'm still trying to wrap my brain around what happened at this place on the night of our visit. I'm numbering the important issues because they are so crazy, no one will believe this horrible experience!!!! 1. We had a party of 10 on our business trip, men women, white, non whites. Stopped at the host stand and  2. was rudely scolded by the woman for not making a reservation on a Thurs of spring training.  Being sympathetic to her busy situation, I said it was our fault and we would go somewhere else.. She stopped me and said, no hang on. At this time a man (the owner) seemed very high strung told us if we wait about an hour, he would have a table. (he only saw me, not the others in our party, they were outside waiting)   So we waited, some of us inside and some of us outside. After over an hour, I told the owner we understood his situation that he couldn't make people leave so we would go somewhere else.  3. He said NO he was going to \"kick these old people out because they were late getting there\" YES HE SAID THAT The hostess came over and asked if we wanted to sit outside and we said Yes of course, at that time the 4.  owner stopped her and said NO NO NO   It was very uncomfortable but then he sat us at another table.  The server arrived and began to ask for our drink orders. I asked for separate checks and he said  5. We do not have separate checks. So I said ok, we can figure it out no problem....  During his delivery of the specials, one of my (non white) guests asked how the swordfish was... at which time the server, put his hand up, said AND I QUOTE 6. \"DO NOT INTERUPT ME WHEN I\"M SPEAKING\" All of us were in such disbelief, I kept waiting to see if there was a punch line. Unfortunately, he was dead serious!! Needless to say, I spoke up and told him he should NEVER speak to ANYONE in that manner let a lone a guest of the restaurant. He tried to say it was because he was extremely busy. yayayayayaya blahahaha At which I requested an apology, He looked at ME and apologized, and I informed him to apologize to the gentleman. He did it very reluctantly .   We SHOULD HAVE walked out at that point but we were so hungry we decided to just wait it out for our food.  Food was good... I will say that.  Next the check came. It was so OLD SCHOOL with  7. nothing printed, only hand written out but ONLY the prices. We couldn't figure out what we were being charged for so we couldn't separate any of the bill. One of our guest tried to stop the server to request, at least a menu, if not something to explain the charges but he tried to avoid us by moving rapidly around the table.  My guest stopped the owner, this is where is went REALLY bad,  8. The owner began raising his voice and telling my guest, \"I'm not your damn waiter, ask him\" 9. my guest stood up and told the owner to calm down at which time the owner was yelling so hard, he was spitting on the neck of my guest!!! We were so shocked, I wanted out of there so I picked up the check and paid for it. It was about to go REALLY bad really fast,  Before I signed, I asked the waiter 10. , \"did you add gratuity?\" at which time he informed me he had tipped himself.    I have managed restaurants for more years than that server has been alive, and I am shocked by what we experienced!!. Here is the piece de resistance....  We walked down the street to a nice bar. I asked one of the staff what was up with Italian grotto, he response was 11.  \"ya, everyone knows they are racist, Its because you had those 2 guys with you\", at this time he pointed to my \"NON white\" employees.  IN MY OPINON  This appeared to be  a. why he didn't want us sitting on the patio outside where we could be seen and b. why it took so long for us to get sat and  c. why the waiter was so rude to my non white friend.  d. Clearly the owner wanted us out and never come back I am from the south and I have never been treated so badly and so volatile. After reading all of these YELP comments This has confirmed my feelings about this place. To add further to it. I was told  12. this is \"the place to go, for MLB scouts\" I would hope the MLB wouldn't support this kind of behavior!!!   I highly suggest people think before they enter this place.  I'm sure due to the high volume of tourist in this area, they will still be around, however, if I can keep one person from going there, then that is what I hope will happen. Shocked and discussed!"}
{"text":"owner is a bigot. went by this evening. All the whites were told 10-15 minutes wait. When I approached ( professional East Indian) I was told there was no space for us tonight. I have lived in the US for the past 40 years and have NEVER faced anything like this incident inspite of having climbed to the pinnacle of my profession. Would stay away if you are non Caucasian. Shame on them. I challenge them to respond to these comments."}
{"text":"I had high expectations when I arrived. My body was craving home made spaghetti and meatballs.   It started off ok. The wine I chose was not a good example Montepulciano. I then proceeded to ask if I could get soda water instead of regular water. We will talk about that later.   It was weird as it is an Italian restaurant and the were playing 80's throw back music. During my entire meal the waiter and bartender sat right behind me and I had to take in their whole conversation. Not cool. We always kept our conversations in the kitchen.  The rest of my meal was ok and the meatballs were good. I was waiting to close out and get my check. The bill came and I said there must be an error, my wine was only $9 and this says $12. No, it is right said the waiter. Your soda water was $3.00.   I said you kidding Right? He said no it is $3. I said, you are charging me $3 For a .02 cent pour from the bar gun? Yes.   I won't be back. Someone is trying to pay their mortgage or pay for their kids school on my dime. It is such a rip off when people do that. I've been in this business a long time and that winds me up. If it were bottled sparkling, yes. It is sad because I finally tried this place out and had high anticipation.  #Rebelfoodandwine #vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #irishcatv2 #italiangrotto"}
{"text":"Cheers to some real Italian dining in Old Town! I can't believe I don't dine here more often. It's one of those restaurants that you kind of forget about until you're walking by it after dinner and think \"oh yeah I really need to go there sometime!\" Last night we finally remembered to go here and I'm glad we did!   Italian grotto is some authentic Italian dining that's owned by a group of Chicago folks. It's homey, warm, sports fill the TVS above the bar, they make sure you leave as stuffed as can be and the environment is great. Every walk of life dines here, whether it be a couple on a romantic date, a family of tourists dining here after a ball game or a large group celebrating a birthday. The restaurant isn't huge but it's not tiny either. It's exactly the size you'd expect an Italian restaurant to be.   The food here is some delicious, fatty Italian. Forget about counting your carb intake here because you will soon loose count! The meal begins with soft and fresh sourdough bread with vinegar and olive oil for dipping. We tried the mozzarella marinara which was fried mozzarella. How can you find anything wrong with fried cheese? I sure can't. Every entree comes with soup or salad. I tried the homemade minestrone which was delicious. It came in a huge bowl though and I couldn't even try to finish it, but I definitely enjoy several tasty sips! For my main meal I ordered the chicken carolina which was a very large chicken breast covered in more mozzarella as well as mushrooms and sitting on a bead of pasta. Like I said, the carb-count is out the window for this meal! Everything they serve comes in huge portions so sadly I could barely even make a dent into my chicken either, but every bite I had made me want to push myself to take another one! The entire meal was food-coma worthy and sadly, we were too stuffed to try their homemade triamisu. Next time though!   If you are in Old Town and looking for some lively Italian dining, head straight to the Italian Grotto and afterwards, go a few doors down to the Rusty Spur for some live country music and drinks!"}
{"text":"Waiter was rude. Why should he care about service since tip is automatically included. Should have read reviews first. My first clue was when he threw the menus on the table like he was throwing a frisbee. We stated we needed two checks and he said no he couldn't do that. Pasta was mushy, not al dente like we asked for, and overpriced. He added a 22 percent tip.  We always tip 20 percent but would not have tipped this guy if it was our choice and not automatic.  We ask another waiter for the managers name and he would not tell us. It deserves zero stars."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The owner was there to greet us and taking care of our table  as well. What service! You don't want to miss this place :)"}
{"text":"I do not suggest going to this place. Very dissatisfied. Food was cold & they nuked it after telling them it came out cold.  Portions are really small for a $34 plate.  The spaghetti and meatballs tasted extremely bland. The seating in the front is horrible as the sun will shine right in your face, I had to wear sunglasses to somewhat avoid the sun. The only thing I liked was the little romaine salad with the Italian dressing."}
{"text":"Food was good and our server was awesome. We had chicken parmigiana and alfredo. Overall a cozy atmosphere with oldies music that was relaxing and fun, and comfort Italian food."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday night for drinks at the bar after a performance at the civic center. The host was extremely funny and gracious. The bar tenders were also engaging. We saw the meals of a few people eating at the bar and decided to make a reservation for the next day.  Our dinner on Saturday was DELICIOUS, an authentic Italian meal. Our server was accommodating and he had back up support to help with his tables. The restaurant was well prepared to manage the larger crowds due to Spring Training and Spring Break.  The food portions were very satisfying. We shared the fried artichokes as an appetizer and shared the chicken parmesan roll. Even though we shared a meal they gave us two small house salads. We were both completely full after our meal and unfortunately did not have room for dessert.   I'll definitely eat here again on future trips to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This manager from the start was very rude eating his food before getting my order. He didn't mind to wash his hands I'm sure which is a health code as well. My pregnant wife also happened to go to the bathroom which was not clean causing her to vomit. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sea Bass special which was Sea Bass baked over 2 spinich ravioli in a light italian sauce and it was wonderful.  Wait staff was on their toes.  Never waited for anything.  Great wine.  If I lived closer, this place would be in my top 3 to eat at.  Just fabulous!"}
{"text":"Sweet place. This corner Italian restaurant in Old town Scottsdale has been there for over 30 years. How do I know? The owner is still serving behind the bar (very cool guy!!). I liked the music (Sinatra and Jazz divas) as well as the food. This time of year in AZ is great, as the climate enables outdoor seating; the French doors were opened and the inside became the outside.  The black leather booths are great for small groups and the lighting will do its part to make you feel comfortable. Food was creative for American Italian: The Carolina chicken (chicken with melted cheese, penne, prosciuto and a light olive oil garlic sauce) is strongly recommended. If you just like to hang out for the bar, I am sure you will like this place as well... great selection and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"If you are going to Old Town Scottsdale this is a great place if you want some great home cooked Italian food. I go to Scottsdale once a year and have always peered in and wanted to go there.. So we did!! The service was slow at first, but then once they started to take care of us it was like we were a regular.. Very kinda old school italian(with a flair of a sports bar) we felt like you were in NY.. A must try is the Caprese Salad it was really yummy!!!"}
{"text":"When we came in the server was on the phone, so he just pointed us in.   I'm not going to comment on prices since it's kind of telling with the location and all, but it's not a place I would afford to go to often.  The place houses a prominent bar, which was where all the people were at. We were early, the only ones sitting at a table. The windows were open which let in a lot of light, which was nice because the decor is 95% black.   When the complementary bread came out, the bread and butter was cold. The butter seemed like it just thawed from being in a freezer. Cold bread is never, ever appetizing. This was incredibly disappointing because I have had GREAT breads at franchised restaurants, even.   We had two appetizers: calamari and fried zucchini. The calamari was OK. The breading was so light it was almost unnoticeable. I did like how fresh the squid tasted. The zucchini was like getting a plate of sauteed zucchini. Breading was falling off and it looked extremely soggy. Also, we noticed the plate looked full because of fried battered pieces, not zucchini.  My boyfriend ordered the bass, oreganata (sp?) style, which was under pasta in a lemon butter sauce. His dish looked good but he couldn't finish it because it was a bit greasy and heavy for him.   I had the cannelloni florentine, which was supposed to have veal and chicken inside it. The crepes were good (lol). The mixture inside looked like shredded, overprocessed.. something. The meat had a creamy texture, which is just weird. It was overloaded with cheese and cream sauce. I didn't enjoy it.   Also, despite it being not busy, our waiter was rushed with us. Not sure why. When it started to get more crowded, he spent more time with people. Don't know if it was us or he decided to step up bc there were more people.   Overall I might try something that doesn't have a lot of cheese but I don't think I could persuade my bf to come back. I'm not that eager to, either.  I rated this based on what the rating caption said. The whole experience was just \"meh\"."}
{"text":"I have only one complaint,Please move your location to Tucson so I can be at Italian Grotto once a week.The food/staff/dish washers/are amazing.The best Italian Restaurant this side of the Mississippi.I brought my daughter who lives out of town to Italian Grotto,Gary(The owner) could of not been any nicer."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here two nights ago while staying in Scottsdale. Had a great time. Baked Ravioli was outstanding. Great atmosphere. We are going to go again and try something else."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  Staff was friendly, helpful and most importantly genuine.  Food was Amazing !!"}
{"text":"Wow I really wish I could give this place 0 stars. Do not come here especially with kids. The manager is a complete drunk that walks around the tables touching kids and making them feel very uncomfortable. The people sitting next to us had kids and ended up leaving because the drunk manager kept touching them. Although the food was pretty good the service was terrible. Our waiter never came by to check on how we were doing, he got my friends order wrong and he was extremely rude about it when he asked him to re make it. If you like drunk owners walking around touching children, terrible service and pretty good food then come here otherwise stay out!"}
{"text":"Wham bam and right out the door we went!  Don't get me wrong the food was pretty good.  I had the Lasagna and 2 PBRs -- yeah so what I'm from the Mid-West!  Bread and appetizers were okay, but I had high expectations overall.  Need a table? -- Better reserve or make sure you have all your friends ready to seat.  This place seems to have a high turnover rate - Follow the orders - Sit, Order, Mingle, Eat, and get the heck out cause someone needs your table!  You know, after a plate of carbs I would like to sit for some time while my digestive system works, but apparently they don't have time for that.  Our server was pretty cool and fun so kudos to Meatball for making it a fun dinner experience regardless - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for decent Italian with a bit of friendly attitude from \"Meatball\" the head waiter, this place will work for you. I get the impression that Meatball as well as the restaurant's owner are transplanted goombahs from Brooklyn, where this place would probably fit right in if it weren't for the faux southwest-style exterior. Several reviewers have complained about the service, but for us, (catching on to Meatball's, \"You talkin' to me?\" schtick right away) it was fine, even fun. The food was plentiful and tasty. I had the manicotti (\"manigot\" in Meatball's Brooklynese) and it was quite good, even if the marinara was just a tad watery. My wife had the chicken Ceasar salad. As mentioned in at least one previous review, it was drenched in dressing, but neither she nor I found that to be disagreeable. The beer selection could be better, but it also could be much worse. It is an Italian place, after all.   I found it amusing that this place sort of masquerades as a higher-end establishment with cloth tablecolthes and napkins, when in realty it is more akin to a pizza joint/sports bar. Old Town Scottsdale is as schlocky and touristy as a place gets and the Italian Grotto is there to serve the tourist trade. But we enjoyed our lunch there."}
{"text":"I work at 2 4 star hotels..recommend this place all the time and frequent enough....Walked In recently and Owner/Manager was severly rude for a very unbusy time. Never again for me or the high clientele and other customers that I would normally recommend to ever again."}
{"text":"There are many good Italian restaurants in Scottsdale. This is NOT one of them. I was very surprised to see any good reviews of this dive and surmise that the owner has family writing them. We went there and had shoddy service--the impression that the place was doing you a favor by letting you spend your money there--awful food (canned spaghetti would have been better), and a cramped filthy restroom. Go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy being treated like sh!t?  Do you like it when a greasy illiterate \"maitre 'd\" insults you?  If so the Italian Ghetto is for you."}
{"text":"If I could post NO stars, I would, as this place should be avoided.  We come to the front and an older grouchy guy is glad handing some people and ignoring the people at the door.  We finally give him our name for a table of five.  He then rudely and aggressively tells us to get out of the way of the customers leaving.  We weren't blocking their exit.  When we ask how long it's going to be for a table he ignores the question, so we ask again.  He then threatens to punch me in the face and we should go somewhere else.  Which we did, happily.  DO NOT go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food AND service here is phenomenal! The food is fresh and tasty!!!! Meatball waited on us and he made excellent food and beverage  recommendations! If you're in Scottsdale and looking for a good Italian restaurant you MUST stop in at The Italian Grotto!"}
{"text":"I concur with several other customers commenting on the owner. We frequented this restaurant for years however once we saw the other side of the owner, that was it for us.  Unpleasant and Rude is an understatment. It's not the way we want to spend a nice evening."}
{"text":"My sweetie and I found this place in Scottsdale on a very hot July evening. It looked cute and inviting and we decided to try it out.   Far from the schizophrenic service mentioned in other reviews, our waiter(s)- all of them waited on us at one time or another- were great fun. Cheeky conversation mixed with good suggestions from the menu. We came up with entirely too much food, which was just fine with us as it was all delicious. Started with a minestrone soup which was better than mine, which is sayin' something because I make great soups. Then moved onto pasta with Alfredo sauce, good again, and I had chicken cacciatore while my partner had ravioli. The cacciatore was just how I would have made it- a light, spicy sauce rather than the gloppy sweet stuff most restaurants make- over a good sized chicken breast and spaghetti. It tasted like Grandma's Sunday dinners.  I took most of it home- in fact it made two lunches for me. Of course, with all the yummy bread and the two first courses we had, naturally it would have been too much. The ravioli was great too. By the time we finished our meal, we were just so full- would have loved to have tried the canoli, we told the waiter, but  just couldn't order another dish. A couple minutes later, he came over with a lovely filled canoli and two spoons- \"Happy New Year\", he exclaimed, centering the canoli in front of us.    The only thing I can say that was a bit of a distraction in this great place was the Sinatra could have been just a tiny bit softer- although it was the perfect soundtrack to the dark set.  Our service was attentive, conversational, and welcoming. If you are looking for formal or stuffy, this is probably not the place for you- service comes with a bit of a Jersey edge here.  We are new part-time homeowners in the Phoenix area. Will we be back? You betcha. It was one of the most memorable evenings of our trip, and we can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I think it's meant to be, a down to earth home cooked Italian restaurant.  The food was delicious.  I got the clam linguini and squeezed some lemon into it and it was fabulous.  My fiancé got the chicken piccata with Alfredo. Again, amazing.  The Alfredo was deliciously creamy, not bland like so many other places.  The chicken and its sauce were very flavorful, as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a delicious meal and not looking for the typical \"downtown Scottsdale\" experience. I felt like I was in New York again, finding an unexpected and unassuming delicious home cooked restaurant that's been there for years, a hiatus from the vapid to-do of downtown Scottsdale. I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill.  Unfortunately, they let many years of success go to their head and the owner has become someone who just wants to fill the restaurant and not care about quality or customer service.  His facade is fading and true colors are shining through.    Our meal was cold and when we told the server about it, you would have thought we started a war.  They took the meal from the table to heat it and then returned with a warmer and smaller portion.  When questioned about it, they ask if I was trying to get a free meal.  I explained that I have been coming here for 15 years and have never once requested such a thing.    I asked to speak with the owner and when I confronted him about the poor service, he asked what my end game was financially...that was so insulting!  It is so sad to see this place that once had charm and ambiance lose the very thing that made it such a wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"The owner was our server. The low class food was very over-rated as well as the prices. Owner was absolutely rude to our party of 4. He made snide comments regarding our questions and I believe they over-charged us. They add gratuity to the check so they don't need to provide good service. I would rather eat at mcdonalds than this place. Save your money and skip this hole in the wall. It was my worst experience at a restaurant because of the callous and rude waiter/owner. The other people in my party agree that the restaurant was terrible. I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place when they come to Scottsdale. Mat from las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. Wanting to dine italian tonight got us remembering out past couple visits to the grotto (both which had us wanting to come back). Im going to give the food 4 stars, and the service 5. Our meal started with the fried artichoke which were good, but i would have liked to see something more creative than an Alfredo dipping sauce. The Caesar salad would have been a lot better if the dressing was homemade. The baked ravioli and the chicken dish were good. lots of heavy cream sauce on the chicken alfredo, but that's what the meal is. The server made our experience worth the $70. From the greeting to the small chuckles through out the meals he was great! We will be back, and with such an extensive menu, id be excited to try another good dish."}
{"text":"Mouth watering Italian Stallion food! Like you got of the subway in nyc and stumbled into a spaghetti tower of goodness. I'm Italian. My mom claims the best. Sorry mom. This is better. Get the chicken parm. Gary, the owner, makes you feel like cousin vinny."}
{"text":"A pretty good place in old Scottsdale, easy to get to and lots of parking all around it.  Service was decent and the portions are generous.  Some of the entrees were really great and others I found to be a bit too salty, though still quite good.  The desserts were excellent.  Price is just a little high compared to places with similar food that aren't in Scottsdale, but we know we'll pay a penalty for eating in that city so it's expected.  They had excellent bread with a spiced-up butter, but I like to also have bread with olive oil.  Unfortunately the oil provided on the table was either bad or it was one of those mixes where they use vegetable oil to cheapen it.  Either way, the oil simply tasted awful.  Overall I'd go again when I'm in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"After a few months in India, I came back to good ol' Scottsdale to enjoy some western food. Decided to walk into Italian Grotto given the positive reviews.  Huge Mistake!  Someone must be pumping up the stats of this place because my experience was absolutely awful. The owner appeared to be drunk and  harassing other patrons; thankfully not us!  The waitstaff was extremely rude and standoff-ish.  Our server gave us one minute to decide after he gave us the menus and then started being condescending because we were still reading through the choices.  Maybe he had somewhere more important to be? The salads came warm, the pasta came cold, and the water/napkins were never reloaded.   There are several good Italian options in Scottsdale and this one's not worth another look. I don't post many reviews, but I would be doing a huge disservice to the Yelp community if I let this experience pass. This place must stay open because of its location because it has nothing else going for it. I wouldn't give this place another hard earned dime!  Pros -- Location Cons -- Ugh, where do I start? Everything else."}
{"text":"Don't go there!  A group of 5 decided to stop for dinner.  Rude employees, so-so food and a psycho owner!"}
{"text":"Located in the Heart of Old Town Scottsdale and they have some amazing Italian Food.  We always go in March during Spring training so make sure to make reservations!!!"}
{"text":"I recently had a birthday for my brother at this restaurant because the birthday boy has eaten here once on a date and enjoyed the food. All I can say is great food but probably the poorest service I have EVER received! RUDE!!!!!! Luckily, everyone at the table was a good sport about the absolute appalling service and found it comical. I doubt I will ever be back because of this.  Get some polite, attentive staff in there!  Gary was great, he should of serviced us!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 2stars is because the service was good. Other than that the food was horrible. 88 dollars for 2 people. I could have made better chicken parmigiana at home. The salad was warm. Our 3 year old could have done a better job at preparing the meal. On top all that the owner himself didn't even seat us he just pointed to the booths and said pic one. Shortly after he was walking two females to there booth! I guess families don't matter!"}
{"text":"Lunch here was great. Ordered steamer clams with garlic bread. Owner comes by and says I need some rigatoni for my sauce. Grabs my bowl and goes and gets it. We shot the sh--t a little. Really good dude. Old school place and old school music playing. Love it"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great food and service every time. The location is great and the atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wandered in to this place on our first trip to Scottsdale back in 2004-thought I was in New York City with the Sinatra music! Great, funky atmosphere and wonderful food. The sea bass is eaxcellent and so is the garlic bread. Very relaxed, old time Italian place like what you would find in New York, San Francisco or Chicago. Don't let the funkiness scare you away-the food and service are wonderful! Very friendly waiters and the owner is sometimes behind the bar charming everyone in site. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a flat pbr and a bunch of watery tomato stuff. Some guy that owns the place was yelling a lot."}
{"text":"The Italian Grotto was a great find in Old Town Scottsdale.  Our experience was made even more special by our wonderfully knowledgeable and energetic server, Harvey. Would recommend asking for his section as he is pretty cool...looks like he could be in a very Italian film.  Highlights:  - Seabass done Picatta style with a side of vegetables - Homemade vegetable minestrone soup (hmmhmm Good!)   Overall, this was a great place to eat and have a good conversation. I would say the ambiance is slightly lacking, however, the food makes up for any flaws. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice place to bring a date...just a little dark for my taste...black decor.  Price: 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine...$80 not including gratuity. Each entree comes with a salad or soup. There is a split charge, however, for the $5 you pay to split each person gets either a soup or salad."}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had. Very rude; terrible service. I do not recommend to anyone. They shouldn't even be in business"}
{"text":"I hope this place goes out to business FAST. In fact not sure how it is still in business. Possibly the worst customer service I have experienced in my life. Owner is a PRICK, and food is even worse. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant.  Food was OK.  They don't even care about their yelp reviews, they told me they would help me write it."}
{"text":"I don't typically leave reviews, but the host/owner was sarcastic and rude before we could even get our name on the list. Needless to say we took our business across the street."}
{"text":"One of the rudest reception from a host ever received. Would never recommend. If I could give zero stars,I would."}
{"text":"Favorite italian restaurant in Phoenix area. Amazing food, friendly staff, laidback atmosphere, right in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"As a general manager at a restaurant, I have never experienced the level of rudeness of a hostess as my family I did upon entering this out dated and empty restaurant. The hostess basically dismissed us and told us we can sit wherever we wanted. We immediately walked out. Very disappointing for my mom and grandma who are visiting from El Paso. Is there a zero stars option?"}
{"text":"Love their food; true NY style Italian (ie Southern Italian). Having grown up on the East Coast, I avoid all chain Italian places, and love little shops like this one.  My recommendation: lasagna. It's great. Their red sauce is delicious, and I'm a big fan of anything made with it. I'm sure their other food is yummy too, but I haven't had the whole menu since I don't live in AZ.  Dessert looks good, but I haven't tried much of it yet. I've only had the cannoli & I enjoyed it.   Their furnishings are a bit older, and their restaurant is about the same size as many of the other mom-and-pop places in Old Scottsdale. It's furnished on the darker side, just like most old fashioned Italian restaurants or steakhouses.  It's great for afternoon lunch (and doesn't get super busy like some of the other \"fad\" places in Old Scottsdale--so no wait!).  At dinner time, they do get busy. They have outdoor seating for when it cools off at night. It's a cute place for a date, or there's a small bar where you can eat a casual meal if you're on your own.   Their daytime/weekend bartender is great. He's been there a long time, great conversation & super friendly. Also, he's very attentive :). The evening bartender isn't ideal, but does his job. He's on the young side for me (in other words seems to find his phone more interesting than even brief conversations with his customers).  Many of the lower star reviews I see here seem to be kids looking for new, shiny, etc.  Just because something is new doesn't make it good, and some places that stick around for a long time do so because they're worth it. This is one of those places!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was excellent!  Not the service.  The watress had a verbal fight with the owner and went to the back and didn't come out for about 15 minutes.   Owner said they were short staffed.  Our waiter (he called himself meatball) was awful!  While we were waiting for our check (a very long time) the people next to us caught him and asked for our check.  He said he walked by us 15 times in 15 minutes.  Lie.  When the other table mentioned that they needed help, he said he needed better customers and that we are only dollar signs.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Had a bottle of wine and a very small plate of Calimari on the patio yesterday.  The wine was good and the Calimari was acceptable.  The owner or manager however is clearly off the rails or off his meds or ON SOMETHING. While waiting for a friend to use the restroom he approached us and asked us if we wanted something from the bar.  We told him we were waiting for a friend using the restroom and he told us it was for paying customers and WE SHOULD LEAVE. I thought he was kidding but since I was not sure we did the prudent thing and waited outside.  Now after reading all these reviews I can see he was dead serious. And THIS JERK was the one who seated us .  Your business will be appreciated more ANYWHERE ELSE!  This is the type of place that deserves to be out of business yesterday and anything I can do to hasten it's demise is worth my time."}
{"text":"Perfect cozy romantic little place. Had a great time. Loved the food and the staff. I will definitely come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Location,  location, location! I respect that this business has been a fixture to old town for 37 years but if you know real momma's italian cooking this place was pretty disappointing.    Service was friendly and attentive, brought sour dough to the table.... Why not Italian bread? I ordered chicken cutlet parm and it was kinda flavorless, the chicken could have been tenderized and seasoned a bit more. My boyfriend ordered the meatballs, because the sign outside said \"greatest meatballs in the world\"... he said \"the sign lied\", we know great balls, we grew up on Italian food we're from New York.... The sauce on my pasta was acidic and overcooked. The one thing that I bitch about is when I get a pasta dish and my plate is FULL of water.  I literally poured it into another plate.  That's just a lazy cook and not acceptable, especially if im paying $50+ for dinner.   Chances are we wouldn't return to Italian Grotto. Lots of other great Italian places in the Valley."}
{"text":"This place is a pit! My first and last time ever eating at this place! Our server seems like he just hates his job and hates dealing with people ... The owner who was definitely drunk didn't listen to the problem I was having with my meal before blowing up... So here's what happened we walked in and it took 5 mins before anyone came to seat us, no biggie . The server comes up no apology or anything,but again no biggie . We are seated next to the kitchen door even though there are multiple tables available. I'm hungry so I don't say anything but at this point I'm feeling like this guy has something personal against me haha. He hands us our menus and walks away. No drink orders or anything! So I call him back and ask him to take our drink orders and he still has no apology... Who trained this guy? So he comes back to take our orders and I ordered the red snapper and my girlfriend orders a plate of spaghetti. The food arrives and to be honest it smelled good and I was excited to chow down... I took a bite and the taste was just off... I tried to eat it any way because I really didn't feel like dealing with the server again. But after maybe 5 bites I couldn't take anymore... I called over the server and told him that I think the fish may be old and that it has a bad taste he just looked at me like I was an idiot... And I  guess the owner heard me because he rushed to the table basically yelling that his fish is fresh and that the fish I was eating was just shipped that morning... I waited for him to finish and asked for my money back and told him we would take our business elsewhere. His face got red like I asked if I could kiss his wife or something...  He yells a bit louder now that the fish was half eaten and that we would have to pay for it... By this time the whole room is staring at us. I threw down some cash on the table and my girlfriend and I walked out....  This was by far the weirdest, worst restaurant experience of my life... These guys need to be shut down or need a change of ownership... You can't treat people the way they do and just get away with it because they are a \" New York\" style restaurant ... I've been to New York and the cabbies have more class than this man... Their 3 1/2 star rating is a joke!!"}
{"text":"A tradition, what can I say? CANNOT go to spring training in Scottsdale and not go see Gary at the Grotto.  Just ask my Italian husband. Classic service from staff.  They are pros.  Great food. Garlic bread is addictive! Pasta amazing. I had ravioli s with a tomato basil sauce. Classic meat sauce, fish and lasagna also winers.  Great wine selection. Gotta have the chianti!   Atmosphere is everything. Great first night to kick off a week of baseball, shopping and amazing meals."}
{"text":"How many times have I passed this place since I have lived in the valley? About a million? I always said, one day I am going there. Well today I did, and I am so glad!!! Girls impromtu lunch today, so glad I was feeling pasta!! We walked in and were greeted by a fantastic gentelman with a very New York accent. Awesome! As soon as we sat down we knew that this was one cool place. We had a group of servers taking care of us, no pretense here! Loved the ambiance! The food, was oh so fantastic! Can't wait to go and try other dishes. This place is great as a first date night. Like I said not a lot of pretense, so some of that pressure is gone;)  Who care if the menus are not laminated, the food made up for that. So going back!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good seafood for AZ. Would definitely recommend this place. Waiter also gave us free dessert!"}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!!!! We simply asked for a napkin. The owner unleashed a barrage of profanity in front of my 6 year old granddaughter and told us to \"get the fuck out\" Other patrons attempted to assist us during his verbal assault to which he started screaming at them as well. I was terrified. He was standing near the door yelling at us to get he fuck out. I didn't know which direction to go. I was afraid to even go past him. I read articles later about this guys and this is definitely typical behavior. All of this because we asked for a napkin."}
{"text":"We heard that Scottsdale the place to find good eats in the area. Most of the non-chain restaurants are located around here and if I had more time, I TOTALLY would have wanted to explore Old Town more!!  Italian Grotto is a cute restaurant with waiters that don't really smile except when you're on your way out the door.  There was no wait here on a Wednesday night around 7:30!!   Here is what I ordered: 1. Calarmari - It was okay. More fried batter than there was squid, but the pieces that DID have squid were good. THe batter is not too heavy and is fluffy like tempura batter..no that was decent.  2. Garlic Bread - for 2 slices for bread drenched in garlic butter, $8 was a hefty price for what it was. too buttery and not enough bread!  3. Eggplant/Mushroom Parm - This dish was a disaster. It came out with a side of spaghetti and the eggplant mushroom part of the entree was wrapped up in a shitload of cheese. It was, for all intents and purposes, a cheese pocket with ridiculously thin slices of eggplant and 7 pieces of mushroom shoved into it. It wasn't even good cheese..it was cheap cheese that was cold when it reached the table and similar to pizza cheese that had been refridgerated overnight. Blech.  4.Tiramisu - This is the only reason I would ever return to this restaurant..it was AWESOME! I like the tiramisu where it is like biting into a sweet coffee cloud. I would come here and order 5 slices of tiramisu next time because this was the only part of the meal that impressed me..   2 stars for the tiramisu..hip hip hooray!!"}
{"text":"First impressions being what they are, the menu looked inviting but it was quickly offset by a server with an over the top attitude. Touting homemade salad dressings peeked my interest but a Barry average dressing. Nice outdoor seating on a cool February evening. Bread was cold. Would I come again, probably not. Touted as being here 35 years, shooting for 40 might require some adjustments!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!   We had a six party and spent over $250 on dinner. Very mediocre food, at best (I had Feticini Parma that was very bland, so bland I didn't even take, the half I didn't eat, Home - so unlike me.) We were in the back by the kitchen very dark and cramped. Waiter was nice.  After dinner we were enjoying a glass of wine with dear friends and family, then, the apparent manager or owner came up to our table and got in my wife's face screaming at us to get out of the restaurant and that we had been there long enough!  We have NEVER experienced ruder service in our life.  We have been coming to Scottsdale for the past 5 years and have found This to be a very friendly city! That was why we were so appalled - welcome to Scottsdale.  He needs to retire, move on, get counseling, or start meditation."}
{"text":"Just a really fun place to spend relaxing after six hours yesterday at Barratt Jackson. On the corner of Main at Scottsdale in Old Town Scottsdale. Owner is hilarious and so friendly with customers. Lots of action in the art district of Old Town.  Order the artichokes and zucchini for appetizers. Have a glass of wine. A place to people watch. Make sure you walk around the Civic Center. Beautiful.  Great service. Great staff. Have fun in the heart of Old Town."}
{"text":"Well.... I am not sure where to begin but this place was very entertaining for all the wrong reasons. I will begin with the atmosphere, to say the least, it's dated but I think that's why it's so charming. It reminds me of one of those classic Italian restaurants you hit up in New York. The food was decent, I think the portions were a bit modest and the plating could have been done better. However, I want to point out the perfect Meatball I had with my spaghetti, it was delicious! Now the service is one of a kind, the place is always busy so the owners and servers are quick to get you in and out. Don't expect to be here a while before they decide to throw you out. We witnessed quite a scene between the owner and customer. It was quite comical! Some yelling, throwing of towels, F bombs, and some serious caddy behavior. The customer was being irrational and extremely rude as well. Not that they deserved that treatment but you get what you have coming I guess. The owner is a no BS kind of woman from New York I'd assume.   Overall, if you're looking for good meatballs and some sassy service then I'd recommend this place.   There is this place in Chicago where the service is absolutely awful and rude but that's how they advertise there business and I will say the place is always crowded. People like the show that they put on. Perhaps the grotto should run with it and possibly meet the expectations of all the other reviews."}
{"text":"The food was ok to bad, and the staff was very rude.  Food came out cold and the waiter just made some snarky remarks when I pointed this out.  If you're reading this then I hope you find some other place to eat.  I recommend that you stop by a McDonalds (or anything else for that matter) instead of this headache of a \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"What a dark place, It's romantic lighting I guess? There's a lotta ambient lighting from the open door, but it could be a bit lighter. We randomly showed up here because we wanted to go to the waffle house but it was packed (2 hour wait... yea not happening).  So italian is a good go to for me to try so we stopped here.  We parked in the back streets.  Nice place to walk around.  The waiter was really nice, I think he must be related to the owner or is the owner since he was not dressed the same as everyone else.  We had the bread and olive oil, it was not super strong olive oil but it was pretty good, and some really nice parm to go with it :)    We also go the garlic toast, wow it's strong stuff, i loved it but if you don't like super strong garlic with a sting, stay away.  The Shrimp Del Grotto was very good, a bit overly salty, the guy actually noted that it looked darker than normal, it wasn't to the point of not good so I kept it.    The Scallop Scampi was also very good, nice big scallops, even the picky lil girl liked them.  The calamari was pretty good as well.  The butter for the bread (which they serve normally, you have to ask for the olive oil) is a bit too solid, but it is some kinda red pepper butter and tasted good.  We did show up here on a Sunday around 2 pm, so it worked out that it wasn't too busy, the bar was hopping cuz there was some game going on and a lotta cheering which breaks that whole dark romantic mood lol.  Talk about conflicting message from teh same place but overall a place I'd go to again.  It is pricey though fyi."}
{"text":"Picked this restaurant while walking through Old Town on a whim. My party of three did not experience any of the negative things mentioned in other reviews. We were seated quickly, had amazing service, our food was all great (we all ordered different entrees), and we found the atmosphere enjoyable. Yes, the owner and wait staff can sometimes come across as abrupt, abrasive, and cocky. But....as someone who married in to an Italian family with New York roots, this is completely normal! My husband felt like he was surrounded by family and bantered right along with staff."}
{"text":"We were originally planning on eating lunch at Bandera but they only opened for dinner. So we were walking north and walked by Italian Grotto.   I wish we didn't eat here.    The ambience was very dark and smelled of sanitation. The restaurant just smelled old and rank.   The food was terrible. The salad had old pieces of red cabbage, the dressing was sour and vinegary. The minestrone soup tastes like leather. The entrees were huge, and for the price they should be. However. The quality was so low and I smelled my fishy pasta from when the server came out of the kitchen. I had a seafood medley of 1 large old shrimp, 1 ok scallop, a bunch of old clams and mussels that smelled and tasted terrible, and calamari that was ok. The pasta noodles were fine however, the quality did not match the price.  I think this establishment needs to really refocus and read all these reviews and make a change. Italian Grotto is in the heart of old town, and people from other states and countries come to eat here and leave with a bad impression of AZ.  This place needs a major revamp and as is, this restaurant should not serve to the public."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star. Don't eat here.  The owner is a jackass. He is rude and obnoxious and just not a very nice person. Steer clear!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the fried mozzarella.  I'll be back. Phdhdududoududydyf Duffy fiddling terrific fight space filling."}
{"text":"Wow...great place! :-D :-D :-D Good food and excellent service!  Old New York atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten at this restaurant and it won't be our last. This is located in Old Town Scottsdale on the corner of Main st and Scottsdale Rd.They serve dinner late, which was nice getting in from a late night flight. The food is phenomenal. The first time I had the baked ravioli. It was delish. On Thursday I had the Chicken Carolina (which was recommended to me by our server, Gary) and it was SO good. The soup and salad were both fresh that came with the meal. The salad dressings were made from scratch and the soup was fresh vegetable minestrone. You also are served bread (either plain or garlic) to dip in olive oil and vinegar. Our server was great! We enjoyed talking to him about sports and the bay area. I cannot wait to go back again and visit this place. The menu is huge and I plan on trying something new each time we visit."}
{"text":"Food was great, unfortunately the staff left much to be desired.   Given the rest of the choices in the area though, it's best to opt for good food and bad service."}
{"text":"Warm greeting, nice outside tables & service was OK, but food was mediocre and overpriced.  The eggplant parmigiana was excellent, but the veal marsala was overcooked & then over-seasoned in a vain attempt to hide that.  Seems like focus here is on tourist crowd and numbers rather than earning repeat customers."}
{"text":"I was making a quick stop here after a friend recommended this place to me and I have come to think that this particular friend may actually hate me because no one should have to go through the Italian grotto experience in their lifetime. I ordered  garlic bread and fettuccine Alfredo pasta with vegetables. It's very difficult to screw up Garlic bread but I must say these guys will do the impossible - my garlic bread was hard as stone. When I pointed this out to the server, he got the manager / owner who defended the uber hard exterior of garlic bread. I understand that these breads need to be crispy but one more bite of it and I would have gone straight to my dentist to undo the damage caused by this garlic bread from hell. Next on plate was the fettuccine Alfredo pasta. I actually checked under my table to check if there was dead animal because the smell of this entree was unbearable and it had way too much sauce in it. At this point i decided to just sneak out of there because I could not convince myself to pay for this utter crap that these guys label as Italian food. Do not go to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you'll pass by a million times, never really giving it a second look. At least that's what I did. Who knew it would turn out to be a great secret, hiding right in front of my face.  Boyfriend and I were in the old town area and decided we wanted Italian for dinner. Saw the good reviews on Yelp and make a beeline for the place. Thank you fellow Yelpers for steering us in the right direction yet again.  The place was busy but we managed to get a table. It's a little crammed but it kinda adds to the experience IMO. The waiter was very attentive but not pushy, which I like. I ordered the white lasagna and boyfriend went with the cheese ravioli. We both chose the soup to start.  The soup was delicious. I knew that if the meal was as good as the soup, this would be a great dinner. The portion was huge and the soup was loaded with yummy veggies and was very flavorful. The bread that came with it was yummy, crusty french bread - perfect for dipping in soups and sauces.  My white lasagna was really good and REALLY rich. If you're on a diet, do not bother ordering this dish. The white lasagna is layered with ricotta cheese, mushrooms and spinach and then drowned in alfredo sauce. No, I'm not kidding. It came in a bowl.  It was kinda like lasagna alfredo soup. And it was awesome!!  Boyfriend loved his cheese ravioli too. Also a large portion, covered in sauce. He came pretty close to licking the plate.  If you want a no frills, casual, basic but amazing Italian dinner, I highly recommend Italian Grotto. I look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Rude service! I bring in my customer to have dinner. The waiter and owner Gary roll their eye whenever my customer start to ask about the menu with their broken English. Food is normal, service sucks!"}
{"text":"This place is more like Italian Grosso. Judging by the huge number of negative reviews, I'm not the only person who experienced Gary the Sociopath. I was in town on March 13, 2015 for spring training with some friends and it was a Saturday night. Every restaurant was busy so I stopped into this place to ask if they had any availability. I was talking to a nice young woman when a greasy haired man with erratic behavior (who I discovered later was the owner, Gary) interrupted and said \"No, there's nothing.\" I asked if he could recommend any other place. He answered, \"You won't get in anywhere, I recommend nothing. Everything is full.\" Perturbed at this odd response, I said, \"So are you saying we should leave Scottsdale?\" Gary suddenly flew into a rage and asked me if I was f---ing with him. He yelled, \"I gave you a good answer and that's what you ask?\" He then stalked off.   Shocked, I asked the young woman who that crazy person was and when she answered, \"my father,\" I felt such pity for her.  She explained that Saturdays are busy and she tried to smooth everything over. I thanked her for being polite and left with my friends. After a few moments, Gary comes outside and proclaims that he wants to \"make amends to whoever he offended\" and that he \"has a table for us right away.\" I told him it was me he offended and when I balked at dining at his restaurant after what happened, Gary stalked away again and gave me the f--- you. You would think that after all these pages and pages of negative reviews about this disturbed man's behavior, that someone would GET A CLUE and GO TO REHAB. Needless to say, stay away from this maniac and his Italian Grotto unless you enjoy being verbally abused."}
{"text":"Local restaurant and bar in Old Town Scottsdale recommended to us by our driver but was nothing special . . . The restaurant staff enjoys their own sarcasm and sharp tongue. The host was comical towards our group, but almost rude to another party desiring to dine at their restaurant. Ask for \"Meatball\" as your waiter, he's fun, makes the best recommendations and provides excellent service, but don't ask for any menu item to be changed - I got the vibe that you get it as it is, no changes or adaptations."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good wine and good atmosphere, but a bit over priced.  We both had veal dishes and enjoyed them along with the wine.  Enjoyed the baseball atmosphere and seats at the window watching the rest of the tourist walk by."}
{"text":"I grew up on home cooked Italian food and specialize in cooking it myself.  This food competes with the best I have ever had.  Everything from \"meatball\", our server, to the last bite of tiramisu, was absolutely AMAZING.  Meatball was not your typical waiter.  He was not rude, he did not linger and talk to much, or not talk enough.  He had a great personality and I will be going back for the great food and his service again.  The lasagna was outstanding.  Meat sauce with Italian sausage lasagna on top of a bed of penne, what more could I ask for?  The cannelloni franchise was mouth watering.  This place had the BEST spumoni and tiramisu I have ever had.  Thanks to Meatball and the cooks over at Italian Grotto. We had an exceptional time.  We will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"I think this owner and the owner of Amy's Baking Company are soul mates. That is all..."}
{"text":"Stopped in Friday afternoon with the family, planned on just appetizers and drinks.  Had the clams, tomato toast shrimp Caesar salad.  Food was so good we stayed for dinner, dessert and coffee.  Service was intuitive and spot on.    Can't tell you how great, fresh scratch made Italian makes you feel.    Brandon killed it as our waiter.  5 Stars.  We will go back.  They killed it."}
{"text":"My new favorite italian spot!!  Loved it.  Talked about it for days.  We ordered a ton of food-- Calamari was awesome, spinach ravioli and caesar salad were perfect.  My husband had two beers, a ceasar and an entree as well.  Our bill was only $60-- totally worth it. Service was awesome, they made us feel like family."}
{"text":"Gary does it right. After being in business for 47 years in the same location, he has seen and been through it all.  You can't beat the price for the culinary experience in the area, not to mention the social aspect and people watching at times.  I can't tell you how many times I passed by this place over the past 8 years and never stopped in. I had no idea what I was missing out on until earlier this year, when I stopped in for a dinner party with Jesse J. and some friends.  It was only at this time that I realized what this place really has to offer.  From the Sausage Parmesan, to the Chicken Carolina, to the Veal Scallopini, I have yet to try anything that wasn't up to my standard of excellence. The Mussels Portofino are amazing, not fishy tasting whatsoever. I am always skeptical of Shellfish in AZ, and usually not a fan of Mussels, but they have been fresh on every occasion here. The same goes for the clams, they are as fresh as can be. The house vinagrette that is served on the salad before your meal is tasty, and i can guarantee that you won't find one leaf of brown or wilted lettuce in your salad. :)  As for the bar, Chris the bartender on the weekends really adds a nice touch to the place. He comes off as being down to business and straight to the point, as you would expect to encounter on the east coast. He will crack a smile once in a while and will chat it up with you it you start the conversation. You will often times see Gary, the owner walking around making sure that all of his guests are being properly taken care of.  The decor in the place really illustrates how long this place has been around, and when you try the food or chat with Gary or one of the other old school staff members, you will feel like you have stepped into an NYC hole in the wall Italian Joint for the night.  Whether you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price with a laid back, yet classy atmosphere, or if you're just passing by and grab a drink at the bar, it's a sure bet that you will leave with a smile on your face, and maybe a little history on the place or the town.  Treat yourself to an old school piece of Scottsdale history and have a nice New York Italian Style meal at The Grotto."}
{"text":"Ooooooo I love this place! I've come here several times and had a good experience every time. The food is great. If you're looking for authentic Italian food, this is your place. The atmosphere is perfect for an Italian restaurant, from the tablecloths to the music to the staff. I tried one of their seafood pastas once that was really good and the last time I got a chicken dish with pasta that was great as well. I like how they have the open window/door things too so it feels kind of like you're outside but you're actually inside. It isn't all that cheap so definitely be aware of that. You also get bread and a salad or soup before your dish so come hungry! I always leave with leftovers which makes me happy! Great spot to come with family or on a date. Stiff drinks too :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is outstanding. The blue cheese dressing divine! The best part is the staff and owners. They are NY Italian. Don't go here if you are thin skinned but if you love a good laugh at the gruff manner it's the place for you. Very busy during spring training so make reservations."}
{"text":"Just spoke to the manager Brandon about my order to ask if it was correct. Told me to call back because it was to busy and couldn't answer my question and said never come back.  This is horrible customer service especially from a manager!  Never order from here or even try to call to ask a question because the managers won't make time."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the Italian Grotto has the best atmosphere in Old Town for a meal, and doesn't make you feel like you're in Scottsdale at all. Cozy and full of life every time I've been, the Italian Grotto has a pretty good wine and beer list, as well as some amazing food.  WARNING: Don't fill up on bread! From favorites (and my favorite) Manicotti, to my boyfriends favorite Chicken Carolina, the Italian Grotto has a wide variety of entrees on their menu (which look like they are falling apart, but I don't mind!) that do not disappoint. The Manicotti was melt in your mouth good, and the extra cheese they put on top was like icing on the cake.  The waiters are always super nice and helpful, and the last time we walked in, the owner showed us to our table personally, which you rarely get at restaurants these days! When the weather is nice out, they open their side doors and push the tables out a little, so you can sit out and enjoy the air and people watch.  This is not really a place you'd want to go when you're looking for a quiet, intimate meal, but the dim lighting and cozy tables can feel quite romantic. If there's a game on, all bets are off though! We went there during March Madness and it was pretty noisy until the game was over (which we didn't mind, we actually came to watch the end of the game).   If I had to pick a place for Italian food in the Valley, the Italian Grotto would definitely be it."}
{"text":"We look forward to dinner at the Italian Grotto when we come to Scottsdale for spring training. Over the years, we have always experienced great food, straight forward and prompt service and an experience unlike any other. If you love olive garden please go there and leave Italian Grotto for those of us who appreciate the uniqueness of it."}
{"text":"Being from New York I know what good Italian food is and this ladies and gentleman was not it. We saw the NY Yankees sign out front and decided this was the place to eat being away from home. First off when we walked in the owner who was also the host ignored my mother and I and asked my step dad the only man in our party where he wanted to sit. We were sat inside in the back it was quite and nice which was probably one of the only positives out of this experience. Our waiter Drew had to be on some form of narcotics because he was slurring his words and not standing correctly. My mother then ordered spaghetti meat sauce with a chicken cutlet on top and was charged for a chicken parm dinner. The other 2 chicken dishes were average. We also ordered drinks 2 beers and a terrible glass of wine. I think the dollar store sells better wine. Over all this was a terrible experience and we will never be back on our future visits to Arizona. Should have waited the half hour to eat at Grimaldi's about 2 blocks away. Better luck next time"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and a quick break from sight-seeing an the sunshine. What a cool little place with a nice low-key, casual at-home feel. The owner was walking around talking to everyone and it seemed like a place I would find my whole family at. Didn't get to enjoy the food but it all looked and smelled delicious. Edmund is the best. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Came here on accident, really, because the place we wanted to eat at was longer serving dinner.  This place was at 10pm, and we were starving.    My friend and I had the Spinach ravioli with pomodoro sauce, which was recommended by the waiter.  It was just okay.  Our third friend had the eggplant and mushroom parmagiana with marinara sauce.  I liked her marinara better than my pomodoro.  The entrees came with a soup or salad.  I had the minestrone, which was really delicious, fresh, and not over seasoned.  My friends had at the salad which was also very tasty, especially with their house dressing.  Because they had run out of bread, the waiter comped us an order of garlic bread, which was drenched in butter, they way we liked it!    The prices were quite high I thought for pasta, but it is a touristy and trendy area.    Well, without this experience, this place would just be another place to eat.  The owner of the restaurant came over to us, said he had heard our conversation all about the SF Giants, the reason we were in town, and suggested we go to the bar to talk to some gentlemen.   I looked over and thought, what the heck is he talking about?   He then brought us over to the bar and introduced us to the father of a Cy Young award winning pitcher...won't mention names...and The Beat writer of the SF Giants.  So...if you are a baseball fan...it's not a bad idea to visit this place!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! I wish negative stars were an option. The owner and wait staff are the worst I've ever experienced! I'm a chef and a former restaurant manager and I never have been treated with such disrespect! We were here less than 10 minutes and will never return! I was appalled by the waiter's rudeness and was shocked to see the owner follow suit and fall in line essentially kick us out of the restaurant while swearing at us. I will NEVER go back here and I will encourage anyone and everyone to not go here!"}
{"text":"Drunk owner(?) kicked me and my friend out for no reason. Other tables even stood up in our defense...doesn't deserve a single star."}
{"text":"Awful, terrible, disgusting!  A friend was in town and stopped in at this tourist trap and was verbally assaulted after complaining that there was a hair in her food.  They would not let her leave, with a bouncer (who the heck needs a bouncer at a restaurant?!) blocking her from leaving until she paid for her uneaten meal.  She was completely shook up when she called me to share her story.  I only wish she had called me before choosing this restaurant.  Put this guy out of business. The food is awful and he is a nasty terrible human"}
{"text":"The prices are a little high but this place is old fashioned, yummy, and has the east coast/Italy vibes! This is a great family place and I would definitely go back with my parents. I like how the meals come with a salad too, that's always a plus! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Italian Restaurant I've been to, period. The service was cold and uninterested and the food had NO redeeming qualities. My wife ordered pasta with meat balls and I ordered the linguine with white clam sauce. They brought my wife pasta marinara with sauce that was more like thin soup than sauce...when we pointed out the mistake, the waiter argued with us until he remembered that we had asked that the meatballs be very well done...he was pissy from then on...totally unprofessional. When we got the meatballs, they were no where near well done...this led to another round of denial. My linguine was just awful.  It was so salty and fishy that after a few bites, I started feeling sick. Neither of us came close to finishing...we sat there until the bill was finally dropped off...paid and left. The only saving grace were the side salads that were decent. With so many choices in Scottsdale this would be an extremely bad choice...don't go here."}
{"text":"Italian Grotto must me doing something right if it's been in business for 30 YEARS +. If you can cant handle different personalities than your own, this place isn't for you. The owners and some of their employees are from the east coast, so be prepare to heckled, but in a joking and fun way.  Now to get down to the food. I must say that in my opinion,  Italian Grotto has the best Italian Food in Town (as far as Scottsdale goes). My husband and I discovered this gem just walking around Old Town Scottsdale. Luckily for us, we were in for a great surprise! As a newbie, we played it safe and ordered the Spaghetti with meat sauce. I never thought something so simple could be so good!! Along with your meal you get fresh baked bread with sun dried tomato butter, fresh salad with homemade dressing. Be careful not to fill up on bread before your meal comes, although its hard not too especially if you get an order of small clams or muscles portofino (white whine garlic butter sauce). Since the past 2 years i have tried enough entrées that i have narrowed it down to two favorite's..... White lasagna, and the Linguine with Clam Portofino! Don't forget dessert! Their Tiramisu is AMAZINGLY good! I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The staff are quick on their feet and aim to please! This place will be a long time favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"I must say this was the worst experience I have ever had in any restaurant in my entire life.  My husband and I go out at least 4 times a week so that is saying a lot.  To start the waiter was terrible.  Then I get my meal and it is terrible.  I ordered chicken piccata and the chicken was like rubber.  To make it worse the owner comes over to our table chewing food while explaining the reason was because the chicken had a stroke and that is why it was tough.  They proceed to take my meal and as it ends up they gave me the same chicken back.  When questioned the owner lied and said it was a whole new plate.  When I called him on it he got mad.  What he didn't realize is I had cut one of the chicken breasts in half and took one bite off to it.  When it was served the first time it was two chicken breasts now he is bringing the dish back and here is the same pieces of chicken.  Once breast cut in two with a piece missing and a small breast.  NOT A COINCIDENCE.  He didn't think I would notice.  I ate the small breast and told him that was delicious but the other one was like rubber.  He didn't want to give me any discount and when I went to pay he finally said he would take $10 off.  I was upset by the way he was speaking to me so I told him I wasn't happy. When he rang up my bill he charged me the full $30 for the bill and said he hoped that would make me happy.  He should not be working with the public. He has no manners and no business sense.  He lost two customers ( and I hope a lot more after this review).  I gave this restaurant a chance but I hope no one else does.  It was a terrible experience. I would not even give this any stars.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the actions of one of the owners/manager. My grandparents and I were the ONLY people in the quiet restaurant and not more than ten feet away from us he was yelling loudly at our server (who was doing a fantastic job) and dropped multiple F bombs. The tirade went on for fifteen minutes until I had to ask him to be quiet. Food is alright but not worth the price and certainly not worth being exposed to such a toxic atmosphere. I still am astounded by the language the abhorrent man was using. I've only written a few reviews on yelp in the many years I've used it and this is the first negative one I have written. People like that don't deserve to own a business and I hope a manger sees this so they can know their filthy restaurant is only matched by the terrible disgusting attitude of the men who run this place. Get some standards, try to put on some clean clothes, and learn how to take pride in your work."}
{"text":"I didn't dislike the place but I didn't like it that much either. My wife and I ate there on an 'off day' during the week.  Yeah...we got seated fast...yeah...the service was good.  Lots of personality in this place.  Very east coast feelings in most ways. The decor was OK. Probably not what I would expect for a place that is somewhat pricy.  I got a glass of red wine. A very very modest size glass I would add.  I doubt a 4 oz pour. My  wife got a basic cocktail.  All was OK really.  Bread came out and it was white bread and butter. Ok....how can you mess that up. We got a zucchini appetizer. Again...not bad, but not thrilling. Was served with an Alfredo sauce, which I thought was a little strange.  Again, very modest portion size on that.  I got the pasta Bolognese and my wife got the cheese ravioli. Pretty good...nothing to write home about.  The ravioli was a really small portion. I think it came in a salad bowl.  The location is awesome.  It's easy to run up a bit of a bill here.  They've been around a long time. People must like it.  I'm more neutral on it.  Considering the restaurant choices in Old Town, I'd probably try something else next time."}
{"text":"The staff here was so accommodating to us on a Sunday night, we came in at a rudely hour of 8:48 (closed af9pm) and they served us a full dinner including dessert without an issue. The food was the best part super authentic esp the caprese drool and the vibe and energy felt so homely and a feeling you want to feel when dining. I would highly recommend, thank you!"}
{"text":"I love there food! Not once have I had a bad meal, service is slow, but I can get over that. As long as you keep my whiskey glass full, I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"Had heard great things about this place and we went with a friend last night. We had a late reservation (when I booked they were happy that it was a late one - 9pm) and we were seated quickly.  Drinks came out for the girls quickly, but my order took a bit longer. No problem. Was a little slow with the wine and my choice was unavailable after having to wait a bit to find out. Second choice was ok as well. Food was disappointing - heavily drenched in red sauce (the girls had lasagne and chicken parmigiana) and although the chicken was good, the lasagne was bland and lacked flavour and seasoning. Interestingly it was served with a large rigatoni - not a traditional style lasagne. The veal dish was poor - the sauce was very watery (should have been thick and creamy), the pasta over cooked and a little bland. I love veal and have it often so I was very disappointed with this meal.. Unfortunately, things like this get poor reviews (from us Yelpers) and I'm sure this place generally is better."}
{"text":"Busy Friday night we walked in with 8 people w no reservation and were well taken care of at the bar.  1st time there but went back with wife the next night for a table for 2."}
{"text":"One of worst places I have ever walked into...owner was a complete asshole.  Roaches!!!!!!!!!  Don't do it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem in Old Scottsdale. They do have gluten free selections for those of you that can't eat wheat/gluten. I enjoy having a wonderful fresh salad, gluten free pasta and a glass of ice tea for lunch out on the patio to people watch during the day!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great dining experience. I was in from out of town. The people I went with have been going there for many years. We were greeted by the owner who was nice and funny, he sat us.  I got the Eggplant Parm and it was delicious. The garlic bread came with sauce and was delicious. The soup was good but could have been hotter. The atmosphere is awesome, small but not too small and very \"un-franchise like\". Service was very good. Overall a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Scottsdale for the past 11 years and have walked past this place tons of times and it's always crowded. After reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided I needed to check this place out for myself. What a huge waste of money. All the negative reviews were correct!! Owner is rude, and loud. Staff is running around like chickens and every once in awhile you'll hear a cuss word or two. Service was not good, salad was gross, my chicken piccata and fettuccini Alfredo had no flavor and the pasta was under cooked. If I rated the Italian food from 1-10, it might get a 2. The best part of our meal was our cocktail and bread. I could not wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"I struggled to find anything I liked about our dining experience here. The location and the outside dining are about the only positives I can highlight. The host was rude when we requested to sit at an outside table saying that because there were only 2 of us he'd lose money seating us at a 4 top table. The waiter was far from personable and made us feel guilty for asking anything. My husband had the Chicken Parmesan which was over-breaded and mushy and not much better than a frozen dinner. I had the Chicken Carolina which was over-seasoned and did not live up to its description.  The bathrooms were also dirty and beat up. Would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"First negative review I`ve ever written on Yelp. ALL these negative reviews are spot on. We had a dinner party with friends to celebrate a birthday, long story short when we had a question concerning the bill, they brought plates of appetizers out nobody ordered for instance! The manager {or owner he acted like he owned the place even though he was dressed like he was homeless, and was upset people were in his place!} screamed at us to \"PAY YOUR BILL AND GET OUT, AND DON`T COME BACK!\" Huh? Than told us we`ve wasted his time. LoL. He no longer has to ever worry about any of us \"wasting his time\" ever again. You shouldn`t either. No need to even get into the food, if one could call it that."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a truly great experience here. The staff were wonderful, loved the Frank Sinatra music, the food and the overall atmosphere. My husband had the veal which he raved about and I had the Seafood Special for that night which was truly sumptuous! But a word of warning....the choice was a creamy sauce or a spicy tomato based sauce .... I chose the spicy tomato based sauce which I was given the choice of 1-10 for spice.....I like spicy but decided to try and be safe and say a 5 due to the fact we were going to see the John Cleese show at a theatre near by and did not want to be sniffling the whole time!......The 5 tasted like a 10.....phew....wowser!!!....don't get me wrong....i LOVE spicy....at home I could go to levels off the chart...but only because I have easy access to tissues and no one is judging me! : ) .....I really did enjoy it but if I had known the true meaning of a five I would have probably said a one! lol The seafood...comprising of mussels, prawns, fish, scallops and baby octopus was divine!  The appetizer of tomato garlic bread was also amazingly good....the tomato dip was really rich and tasty....much better than what we had expected. And I must not forget the desserts.... the house made Tiramisu and Cannoli was AMAZING! Try it with a small glass of Grand Marnier and you are in some kind of heaven!  Also two added bonuses....I got roses from my husband from a flower seller who walked through the restaurant AND when we asked for a photo our very nice waiter yelled out \"Hey Paparazzo!\" and along came running  a wonderful waiter who was in his home town a professional photographer....and I would believe him...most people look at cameras like it is a totally foreign object....he was using the zoom etc... like he knew exactly what he was doing! lol  This was a truly great night for us....can definitely recommend. : )"}
{"text":"The area is beautiful and that's what you're really paying for here. Nice ambiance on the outside patio at night. The food is average and def pricey for what you get. The Caesar salad was $8 for no croutons and no fresh grated parm, literally just lettuce and dressing when you upgrade your side salad they should let you know it's $8 more to upgrade. Service was slow on a super slow weekday night. My boyfriend enjoyed the spaghetti. My halibut was tough. The garlic toast appetizer was really good."}
{"text":"We are visiting Scottsdale for the weekend and someone at our hotel recommended this place for dinner so we decided to check it out. I am not the pickiest eater but this food was the worst food I've ever paid for in my life. I ordered the eggplant parm (or some variation of one) and got a plate 2 tiny sliced eggplants, a lot of what looked like soggy canned mushrooms that tasted awful, 10 pieces of rigatoni that didn't taste fresh, an entire can of tomato sauce which was awful and very watery in some parts and a little slab of partially melted cheese of some sort. It was also not hot. It was so unappetizing and disgusting, but since I was paying $21 for it, I forced it down. It was not filling, not good and extremely overpriced. We ended up paying $48 for 2 entrees. We didn't order any drinks or anything else. Should have gone to Buca di Beppo which is a chain that I can trust and would have paid $25 for two to get good food. I will add that service was great; the waiter was very attentive and friendly and food came pretty fast. Wish I'd read some reviews before wasting my money and meal on this place."}
{"text":"Avoid this location at all costs. I'm serious. Do. Not. Go. Here.  My friend and I wanted some noshing and some pasta dishes so we decided to check this place out since it's close to work.  We were the first patrons to sit down since we arrived just when it opened. Our server was courteous but his appearance was disheveled. Come on. You're the face of the restaurant. Put on a clean and unwrinkled shirt! We sat down and our table wasn't even clean. There was salt all over it and crumbs.  Still, we stayed. I don't know why.  We ordered the mussels portofino to start. What. A. Disappointment. The broth, which should be labeled water down, was flavorless and very thin. The mussels tasted old as well.  We opted to leave early and the only reason why I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the waiter comped our food.  If you're looking for seafood or great food in the old town area, forget this place. Go to Tommy V's. That's what we should have done."}
{"text":"Such a cute Italian spot. Make SURE to sit in Koop's section. He is a fantastic waiter!"}
{"text":"Gastronomical yumminess!  From a family that does not like Italian food!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Grotto since 2001.  Gary runs the place like a NY style joint.  The service can be bad but that is part of the charm.  I have sampled EVERYTHING on the menu and love it all.  Diana Manages the place and she is Fantastic!    My favorite meal: I start with the Zucchini( pan fired with a lite batter and amazing white sauce) Then move on to the soup ( Amazing Minestrone) Then have the Chicken Carolina (Every bite melts in your mouth) Or the Sea Bass Picatta( Soo good) I Finnish it off with a White Chocolate Tartufo or a Cannoli.   Complete the meal with a nice bottle of wine in one of the tables that opens to the sidewalk and you have the perfect evening.  Not the cheapest place in the world.  But one of my favorite restaurants in the world!  And if its baseball season,  the only game on will be the Yankees so don't even ask to change the channel!"}
{"text":"Yeah so we love this place. We get the mussels and they are so good. The bartender is a trip. It's like being back in NY. If you're not Italian and from the east coast you might not get it but I'm telling you you'll love it. So authentic I feel like I'm home."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place forever. When I finally got the chance to do it, I ordered the clams and mussels spaghetti. The clams were fine, the dish was OK, the muscles were so rotten. When the dish came to our table my husband gagged and said it smelt like feet. I agree. I am an avid seafood lover and I knew by the smell that something wasn't right. And they ask you if you would like some garlic bread. Be careful because what they don't tell you is that they charge you $6 for it. All in all, I would not return...ever."}
{"text":"I put one star because zero stars is not an option. Poor quality food. Poor service. Very overpriced.  A total tourist ripoff. Very bad attitude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"I have been having an internal debate for a few weeks now about how detailed of a review I wanted to write. I have decided that although I am not excited about wasting more of my time on this horrible establishment, but if I can keep them from making money off of at least one unsuspecting patron, I have succeeded. I will keep it relatively brief because my experience was not much different than most of the other one star experiences complete with rudeness and threats.  We were hanging out in Old Town one evening after spring training and decided to stop in. We walked up to the host stand and a line quickly started forming behind us. As my friend and I were wondering where the host was, the gentleman behind us (from another party) informed us that they never have a host and we should beware because when someone does show up, they will be very rude. Weird, we though. I asked his why he still came and he told me, \"for the food.\" \"Well whatever\" we thought. We shall see for ourselves. He was right about the rude part. We never made it to the food part and I don't care because my hard earned dollars won't go to support such an awful family (it is apparently a family owned business).  The owner eventually stumbles up with his glass of wine. My friend says \"excuse me, we have a party of 3,\" to which he replies smugly, \"yeah I see that...\" Shortly thereafter, a server walks by and as we try to get his attention, he purposely ignores us.  Um ok.  Next, a server comes up to use the credit card machine. My friend says, \"excuse me but we have not been helped yet, is there a host?\" To which he replies, \"look, if you were sitting in my section, I would help you out, but you aren't, you are here. So you aren't my problem.\" Charming.  Rinse and repeat with a third prince charming who says, \"whaddya want me to do, it's busy, etc. etc. [insert a few more obnoxious comments here]\"  So now that my friend has been treated disrespectfully 3 times, I'm pretty irate and grace our resident jerk with a few choice words of my own. (hey, I'm not proud of it but well.....he deserved it). He looked shocked at a lady standing up for herself and wouldn't you know the big man threatens to call the police. I asked him to please do so (loudly and with an obscenity), but he declined.   At first I thought that this was rudeness combined with an utter lack of respect for women. I do think that is true, but it goes further, as it does not seem that they have respect for any of their customers. However, if you can read all of these reviews of behavior that would be unbelievable if it weren't for the sheer QUANTITY of similar reviews, and still donate your cash, I would not respect you either."}

{"text":"That shit was hilarious! Something died in the kitchen and everyone is trying to be polite and not say anything about the stank.  Typically, this place rocks.  Get the owner drunk, it's entertaining."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. Great location with an incredibly authentic feel. My wife and I followed our waiter's recommendation and it was well worth it. I can't think of words to describe how great this place is for a nice quiet date.   I would recommend you ignore these bad reviews. The waiters are charismatic and I'm guessing these people have thin skin. Their charm is half the fun. Same with my barber shop: all the bad reviews are people who don't have personality. I'll be back many more times"}
{"text":"don't go here. Ruined my birthday. The owner is crazy.  We wanted to leave bc he said he sat us in the kids section away from every other person and our server was outside reading a paper during our 10 minute stay. my husband went to the owner to let him know we weren't pleased and ready to pay for our drinks and leave. the owner along with every employee came running up to us trying to kick us out and push us out.  it must be a weekly thing. It is important to note this was all in front of my 3 year old."}
{"text":"This has become one of my Go-To places in Scottsdale that I hope to visit every time.   The calamari is amazing, the Garlic bread is delish, and the Veal was very impressive. The wait staff is always engaging and fun to interact with.   I have been here alone and in big groups and its great for either. We had a party of 8 and they sat us nearly immediately. Unfortunately we weren't there 30 minutes earlier, because Giants closer Brian Wilson had just left!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. Upon 2 minutes of being at the establishment, simply asking if the Golden State Warriors game was being played, the owner of the restaurant told me and my younger brother to shut up multiple times and threatened to fight my father and spit in my mothers eye. The bouncer blamed it on the owner being in a \"cranky\" mood. Cranky or not; telling minors to shut up and threatening to fight your customers is completely unacceptable. And on top of it, according to a couple locals after the exchange; it is shitty and overpriced Italian food. If you want to pay a lot for bad food and to be harassed then this is your place! Legitimately the single worst restaurant experience I have had in my entire life.   Found this article from SIXTEEN YEARS AGO that relatively matches our experience: http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/restaurants/veni-vici-vendetta-6415532 legitimately cannot believe this place is still in business."}

We were told that we would get one table and as we arrived there was two tables to accommodate us.  We had no problem with this.  As our server arrived; one of our guests asked for a $50 bottle of wine yet we were told to \"pick up the wine list and tell what we wanted\". But we knew the name.  Then numerous guests at our table were told we were not sitting directly in front of our napkin/place settings.  At this point we asked if we were inconveniencing him to be there and asked to see a manger.  The short gentleman approved and was so rude and condescending to us.  He stated he was a manager but we later found out he was the son of our waiter.  We immediately left; but was followed by the servers son and was cursed and flipped the bird.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.  Don't waste your time.  Once we realized we were speaking with an owner and she had to tell the gentleman faking as a manager to stop staring and threatening us to leave our presence, that is when we realized its a poorly managed establishment."}
{"text":"This weekend, my wife with our baby and my wife's parents were in Scottsdale and attempted to eat at this restaurant. My wife and her mother first went in to see how long the wait time is while her father waited in the car with the baby. When she went in and asked what the wait time was, one of the workers, we assume was the owner, didn't answer and just walked back into the restaurant. He then returned and started to wave my wife and her mother back to a table for 2. She stopped him and explained that her father was in the car with our baby. Then he says, \"No, no, no.\" She asked, \"What is your wait time for 4 people?\" Again, he replied, \"No, no, no.\" She asked about the open seating on that was on the patio, which was enough for 4 people. Again, he said, \"No, no, no.\" At that point she says, \"Oh, now I get it. You don't want to serve anyone with a baby.\" To that, he did not reply. She and her mother left and returned to their car which was close to the entrance of the restaurant. They then witnessed a group of 4 people (without a baby) go in and we're promptly seated at the same table she asked about on the patio. So tonight I call and asked to speak to the manager. The gentleman who answered the phone asks how he can help me. I then reply, \"Are you the manager?\" Without saying yes or no, he again asks how can he help me. (Im guessing he was the owner.) I proceeded to tell him about my wife's encounter this weekend. Before I even finish my sentence, he interrupts me and said she didn't have a reservation. (I got the feeling he knew exactly what incident I was talking about.) I asked him of he told her that she needed a reservation. He just repeats that she didn't have a reservation. I then explain he started to seat she and her mother but when he found out they had a baby, he refused her service. Again to this he says to me she didn't have a reservation. (Keep in mind his tone during this conversation is very rude and disrespectful.) I then try to ask if they have a policy against serving parties with babies. Again he replies she didn't have a reservation. He then tried feed me some BS about spring training and they are really busy. I tried to ask him again if he told her that she needed a reservation and he then hangs up on me. I call back and someone else answers. I asked him if he was a manager he said he was just the guy who answers phones. I start to tell my story to him and he then hangs up on me. Needless to say, we will not be going to this restaurant ever again and we will be sure to tell everyone we know about our experience and how they treat families with children."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!!!!!  PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU EAT HERE!!!  Was the single worst dining experience I have EVER had, simply due to the arrogance and attitude of EVERY person working here, from the server who was defensive unnecessarily,  to someone named Brandon aka \"Meatball\", to the host, who wouldn't seat my husband until I came back from using the ladies room?? (Huh?)  We should have immediately left at this point and saved our $90 instead of being ripped off and feeling like they raped us.   Items of note about the experience this evening: 1.  We both ordered seafood fettuccine and it arrived WITHOUT any fettuccine!  It was made up of one shrimp, one scallop, a small chunk of \"fresh fish\" about the size of a golf ball, six mussels (the shells take up a lot of space in the bowl) and calamari which I thought was the fettuccini!!  The Alfredo sauce appeared as a very thin soup in the bowl, again, sans fettuccine!  Price was $28.00, times two, since we both ordered this. When we asked about why the seafood fettuccine came out without any fettuccine, we were told it was because we ordered the vegetable side, which was in place of the fettuccini. So if that weren't insulting enough, when the bill arrived, we were up-charged $5.00 for the side of fettuccine they brought when we initially asked where it was!  OMG!!   2.  Brandon aka Meatball (he told us) was so defensive when our server (quickly and inexplicably) refused to deal with our concerns and went and got him, the last thing he said to us, was advice to \"stiff our server\" on his tip, since he didn't explain things as he should have. Say what!??  That was a first for me, hearing a manager give this directive regarding his employee. It's leadership at its finest, clearly.  3.  Caesar salad was coated in dressing to the extent that I couldn't eat it. And not one crouton was included in this salad. Minestrone soup was mediocre. Had one small pat of butter with the four chunks of bread so had to ask for more butter. And the vegetable side was inedible. $90.00, folks. (This includes $20 for two vodka martinis, BTW.)   Bottom line, these 350 reviews all mostly speak to the same types of issues, which involve poor attitudes, overpriced items for mediocre food, at best, and they are so good by this point of talking over you and immediately going on the defensive, they just flat out do not care whether you are satisfied or not. So lesson learned. When it comes to this joke of a place in Old Scottsdale with the primo location, save your money and ALWAYS, ALWAYS READ THE YELP REVIEWS regardless of where you go to dine. All these people can't be that wrong!!!  TERRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"We went there during Spring Training on a Saturday, basically the busiest night they have I would guess.  Food was great, service was great... great great great"}
{"text":"so disappointed. I have heard way too many wonderful things- I was ecstatic to go and our waiter \"meatball\" was beyond rude. I have never in my life been spoken to the way he did. We asked to split a check- he said no.. Which was absolutely fine. His response was \"want me to read it to you?!\" He then proceeded to read it out loud to the restaurant and then \"lobbed\" (in his words) the menu to the table. I then approached him after to address is lack of professionalism. He refused to further address the situation. Think about it- 7 person party who is willing to spend over $100 a month. They're losing about 9k from us. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Slinging  below  average  Italian food  to unsuspecting tourists  since 1977. The glass of water was pretty good..."}
{"text":"Don't look at the photos after ordering you won't want to eat it! Muscles were flavorless"}
{"text":"Calamari, overcooked. 2 orders of veal, overcooked. Drunk guy walking around the entire meal screaming? priceless."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's the atmosphere of dim lights and mirror lined walls... Or the guy sitting in the corner booth who could pass as the Don of a major mafia family, but this place is fucking rad! Thats right, rad!!! I'm Bringing it back.  If you visit this gem of an Italian restaurant, there is only one thing you must order. The Chilean Sea Bass melts in your mouth. It is well seasoned with garlic, pepper, herbs and possibly crack (I am salivating just thinking about it). The generous portion of fish is served atop a bed of linguini noodles and some sort of cream sauce that could have been alfredo... But if it was, It was the best damn alfredo I have ever tasted.  The service is quick but not rushed... The full bar makes a stiff drink. It is everything that a small independent restaurant should be and more. Restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale should take note... Their recipe for repeat business works!  If you visit AZ, This restaurant is a must visit!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Went to eat here with a friend. Asked to see a menu, when am older gentlemen looked at us in disgust and told us, \"you ladies should go somewhere else.\" After gaping at him in horror of his treatment we left. Glad we didn't stay."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix AZ while doing a little site seeing in old town Scottsdale saw a sign. Fresh seafood. This Italian restaurant with a romantic cozy private atmosphere. Is out of this world!!!  With four fish specials :  your pick halibut, salmon, swordfish and sea bass. Then you pick from eight different Italian noodles and sauce preparations. You can't go wrong. Your favorite fish your favorite noodles and sauce. True Italian recipes that have been handed down through the generations. Grandma would be proud. Then finish the meal with some orangecello followed up with tiramisu. Love it love it, love it and you will too!!!  We will be back and highly recommend you stop in. For got to mention the Wait staff AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible.....Is that the soup nazi I see in the kitchen....no its the owner...OMG stay far far away....."}
{"text":"We were a party of 10 and we waited outside for the table to be ready. An inebriated woman told us she'd been in Scottsdale for a week and this was the worse meal she'd had. Deciding to take a chance we went in. The service was immediately great. Bread and water on the table and drink orders taken. The biggest martini I'd seen arrived (it was great), our orders were taken and the food was fantastic. Everything we expected. I had perfectly cooked halibut. My husband had veal piccata, and everyone raved about their food.  Not sure what the drunk women had a problem with, but I'm thinking it may have been her."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had in Scottsdale.  These folks need to head back to NYC and take their terrible food, service and bad attitude with them.     I cannot believe all the good reviews here.     There were eight of us so they automatically add the tip and boy did we pay for it.   The terrible waiter who admitted he was from buffalo complained about us right to our face and the odd thing is we didn't do anything at all.  Owner came over at the end of he night and told me that you don't have to like everybody as he doesn't like his ex wives (?) and they didn't need our business as they're always packed. He also suggested I write a terrible review so I thought I should.    Food is expensive and below average.   Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I had to even give this dump one star but I couldn't continue with my review unless I did.  I wish there were an option for negative stars.  This place is a dump, the food is inedible and the waiter Roberto as well as the owner are rude and totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"Beware gift cards expire. Who does that anymore?  If I pay you $100. Why should it expire?  Stupid!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Worst host service I've ever experienced. Not even very busy but the idiot at the door couldn't tell us how long the wait was. Seemed to be drunk or high. Asked several times but I don't think he could add or tell time. Never got an answer. I'd suggest you cross the street to Bucca."}
{"text":"I would leave 0 stars if I could. Host was extremely rude, we came with our toddler and asked politely for a patio seat, and without hesitation he bluntly told us he doesn't want kids on the patio!?!? Really? Given there were no customers inside and seats available on the patio. My husband and I had eaten here once before and it was nothing special, was willing to give it another chance but now I don't think we will ever return."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I spent a good deal of time here after the Spring Training game we went to. Just needed a place to relax, continue with the drinks, and hang out. As a disclaimer, this is a review for the atmosphere and the experience. We did not order any food here, just beers.  Pros: (+) Nice atmosphere. Got tables, a bar, and TVs so you can watch whatever game you want  (+) Down to earth - a lot of the staff seemed to know their patrons and have a personal relationship with them. Also willing to chat with you. (we were playing a game on our ipad and occasionally asked the bartenders for help solving a problem, and they were totally down to play and help out) (+) Full bar, sufficient assortment of beers (+) The food looked pretty good, from what I witnessed around the restaurant. Saw someone eating what looked like spaghetti and meatballs which looked delicious  Cons:  (-) One bathroom, which kinda sucks in a bar  (-) A few of the bartenders I noticed did have somewhat of an attitude, but I think you just kinda have to have a backbone and not let it bother you.   Overall, a cool dig."}
{"text":"If i could give this place negative stars, I would. Not only did I not get greeted but was told to leave because I requested to sit outside when there were clearly tables available. Sorry if the geriatric Italian smell was not appealing but it was a beautiful evening in Scottsdale. Good luck with that customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking to celebrate because I got a new job and he made a big sale for work. Therefore, we began looking up good Italian food on Yelp and found the Italian Grotto, which happens to be right by where by boyfriend works.   We went to dinner pretty early so we were one of the very few people in there besides  some individuals whom were there for happy hour. We started with a nice bottle of chardonnay and calamari. We were big fans of the calamari, I tend to see quite a few reviews on Yelp that suggest some people think all calamari was created equal and I disagree. The breading was very light and crispy and had some spice to it, the squid itself was very tender and was what I consider the perfect consistency for fried calamari.   One of the only downfalls of the whole meal was the bread that was first brought out. We were pretty hungry when we got in and the bread didn't come until right before the calamari, a good 10 minutes after the drinks, and when it came it became clear that this bread had been sitting out for quite some time and was starting to harden up. Certainly not a deal breaker but something I tend to look forward to when heading out for Italian cuisine.   Next came the salads, I had the red wine vinaigrette and my boyfriend had the bleu cheese. Both of the dressings had great taste, my only criticism would be that the lettuce was not dried off very well after washing, once again not a huge issue, but something we remembered.   Finally, the entrees. I ordered the scallops in a white wine sauce over a bed of pasta, and my boyfriend got the Chilean sea bass over spinach ravioli. Not the absolute best scallops or piece of Chilean sea bass we had ever had but the sauces they came in were to die for. Then the waiter noticed how much we were digging the sauce and brought us out a basket of fresh bread still warm and soft. I don't think they had to put those plates in the dishwasher after we were through with them.   Our server did a great job, he was knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly gave you space without being negligent. The atmosphere was precisely what I look for in an Italian restaurant. It's casual enough to be fun and relaxed, great music playing the whole time (Dean, Frank and company), very colorful obscure painting on the walls, but also had the ambiance to back up its pricing.   We wanted to get desert but we had a hard time standing up straight we were so full. So we didn't for a while, enjoyed our seat next to the window as the sun was setting on Old Town Scottsdale and watched the world go by as we finished up our bottle of chardonnay. All in all a tad on the expensive side but I certainly will be going back to try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"To start the bench seat thay gave us was old and knobby had to find the least uncomfortable spot that didn't wobble. Atmosphere is very dated. The caesar salad had a strong fish taste, which to me is not normal and gross- told the server about the salad and he didn't acknowledge the concern took my plate and walked away. The chicken piccata was not terrible, but not great either- the server asked if the second round was better than first so i guess he heard our concern about the salad yet did not remove it from our bill. Also the tomato sauce on my wifes ravioli was not good, likely from a can..  Will not return to this place.   Almost forgot.. pretty sure I had food poisoning the following morning."}
{"text":"Meatball is a meatball, to dark which is always a bad sign silverware wasn't clean spotty and the waiter named MB was quick but not helpful upgraded salad to Cesar was 7.00 and shredded like rabbit food no real parmigiana and he never asked if he could start us with some nice Italian bread instead he ask if we'd like some garlic bread which we agreed but wAs 12.00 most good Italian restaurants give you olive oil or garlic complimentary to serving you he just wanted a higher bill for a better tip! They need to clean up there act and get better more helpful service turning tables is one thing but up changing is disturbing when it as plain as day, overall the food wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 on Sunday night at 5:00. Plenty of tables available and got seated right away. Outside which was nice. The owner who seated us didn't say one word just walked us to a table and pointed. I ordered Chicken Parm.. $21 for a piece of chicken and some sauce and cheese. Okay, I understand it is Spring Training and all but come on. We asked for some more bread and they finally brought it out after the 4th time, yes 4th request. Just not worth it. Got the feeling they didn't care and just wanted to turn the table quickly. So, save your money and head tobMaggianos up Scottsdale Rd. Tastes much better and 1/2 the price!"}
{"text":"Great food as usual.. but one things that always grabs my mind.   The menu's! The are printed on paper and are not laminated .. while that is not a problem, the fact that someone else's spilled drink is on it..was  Food still rocks, I always order the same thing, so maybe ill just avoid the dirty menu's all together."}
{"text":"After a long day at the pool while on vacation, my DH and y Myself along with my 2 year old were famished and really tired.  We tried to go into a few other restaurants in the area but were turned down as my DH had on a tank.  My poor 2 year old was so tired and hungry by the time we arrived at this lovely restaurant. We were welcomed in and they immediately noticed how upset my daughter was. Brought out a cookie , water and offered to bring her food immediately.  The wonderful hospitality didn't stop there.  The manager heard my daughter say the word \"ice cream, \"and offered to take her in the kitchen so she could get her own.  Later she fufilled her promise, and  my daughter was so excited! Our food was absolutely delicious as well.  Would highly recommend this place.  The menu had many wonderful selections.  Fun place as well."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We asked some locals where to eat and they recommended this place to us.  Great suggestion!  We were in Scottsdale for 4 days and this is definitely the best food that I had while we were there.  It feels like a NY Italian restaurant...dimly lit, dark-colored booths, sinatra in the background, and some NY-style servers.  I had the halibut and it was excellent.  My husband really enjoyed his lasagna as well.  We also had the tiramisu and the cannoli.  Both were very good, however I think the tiramisu was the best.  Our server was very friendly and very attentive.  They really take care of their customers and want to make sure that you have a good time.  If you're looking for a place to have some great food and to have an overall fun experience, check this place out.  After going there for dinner, I can understand why it's been around for over 30 years."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Cannelloni stuffed with the most delicious, melt in your mouth chicken and veal. Fried calamari - perfect."}
{"text":"This place packs you in like sardines but that fact aside I liked it.  Had the fish special and it was amazing. Super light and tender with a tomato sauce (not marinara) on top.  The eggplant parm was good with a huge side of pasta.  Big ol' basket of bread.    We sat and chatted just for a few and the manager/owner asked us to move the the bar and he would buy us a glass of wine. Normally I would have seen that as offensive, but the food was really good and the place was packed so we took off and didn't gripe about it."}
{"text":"Two local friends of mine and two from out of town ate here last sunday. My spinach ravioli portion was 4 pieces the size of a saltine cracker. I'm a small person, but the portion was way to small... So I filled up on bread, which was good. One of the men I was with said his Halibut tasted like \"fish sticks  on a plate of pasta', he was not happy with the preparation or the portion size. How much does pasta costs!  There must be a shortage! There was 5 of us, we split up the bill, some cash and three credit cards. We were not finished with paying the rest in cash, when the waiter returned our credit cards, he pointed out that so far we had \"Only left a 10% tip. Accused us of \"Stiffing him' and that he \"Had been stiffed all day today!\". We pointed out that our bill was $182 and that we had planned on leaving a $45 tip! Which we did because we are not Cheap!  He apologized and gave us a piece of Tiramisu to split amongst the 5 of us!  We were insulted over an OK meal. Keep the change! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Salty canned clam sauce.  Thick overly capery veal piccata. Terrible cafeteria salad.  No fresh pasta to be seen.  This is college cafeteria Italian. Also, they wouldn't give us our free dessert because we didn't print the coupon. The manager was dressed like a  midwestern dad in sneakers and jeans.  The place screams \"I can't be bothered\" with customers."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I wish I could tell you the chicken is rubber. I wish I could explain how rude the waiter was when he spilled scalding soup on my friends lap. The reason I can't tell you any of this is because my friends and I never got in. We arrived slightly early and spotted a parking spot right in front. Boom parking karma (Screeching brakes) until we can't fully pull in to the spot because of a drunken tweaker straddling the sidewalk. Should have tipped us off to how the evening was going to unfold. After sending ahead our low man on the totem pole we are told there will be a wait. Hey no problemo. It's 7:55 and we've got an 8:00 reservation. As we hang outside it becomes glaringly obvious this joint has no intentions of seating any of the folks who are waiting WITH RESERVATIONS. As we wait one of our group says he was tipped off to this place listening to a local San Francisco sports show. Lo and behold there is said morning show host Murphy(must be tough being named after a wedgie) blocking the front entrance and generally acting like a douche. Eventually we reached the breaking point and left when the host informed us that it would be a 90 minute wait from our reservation time. HA. The positive to the whole experience was the CD we bought off some dude outside while we waited. It had some awesome beats and the legendary track 7 titled \"Who the F**k are you?\" came in handy when we circled the block and bumped the radio to 11 while letting Murph know he is a tool. Hey maybe next year I'll actually get inside to try some food."}
{"text":"We had the mozzarella appetizer. It was a large slab of lightly breaded mozzarella with delicious marinara sauce. It was nice having a slab of cheese instead of sticks like in other restaurants. That appetizer was mouthwatering. We are still dreaming about it. Our bartender Tom was great. We loved his dry humor. I rarely laugh but I was laughing a lot! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary to not so good Italian restaurant with prices only a tourist could love. Caesar Salad was nothing but a plate of romaine lettuce tossed in vinegar and oil. No cheese, no anchovy. That my friends is not a Caesar Salad, that is a plate of romaine lettuce. Service was very attentive but rushed. Bread was so airy you could read the menu through it. Grilled chicken had to have been right out of a Sysco truck and we didn't have a good feeling about the restaurants cleanliness after using the washrooms."}
{"text":"I wish it was possible to give this place negative stars. Please avoid it at all costs and save your hard earned money and go to a decent restaurant. This place was filthy, food was below mediocre and overpriced, and worst of all, disrespectful owner with too much of an attitude. How can you get away with charging 21 dollars for a chicken caesar salad that seemed to be made with leftover chicken scraps, bagged lettuce, no croutons, and of the size of a side salad? I am a seasoned cook and foodie and eat out often, and by no means this is acceptable anywhere. Even when I used to live in NYC they would never get away with charging that, and if so, it would be in a top notch restaurant in the city.   The worst part was when my boyfriend's mom nicely requested a tad more cheese for her pasta and the owner almost dumped the whole cheese bowl in her plate! By no means should customers by treated in this manner. He was even eavesdropping our conversation and gave his input in regards to the subject. What kind of person in his/her right mind does this? In all, you are warned! Please don't come to this establishment."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night on NY Eve. This restaurant has a special ambience that is not matched by other Old Town Restaurants. We were seated and welcomed even without reservations, having cancelled our own plans for outdoor grilling due to poor weather. The warm garlic bread came out of the oven toasty and with a marinara sauce. We had a nice bottle of Malbec. Main courses included pasta, Chicken Carolina, and sausage over ravioli. It was a special experience with friends, and we'd like to try the patio in better weather. Thank you for welcoming us on short notice! We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place honestly doesn't understand the concept of service. After being ignored and disrespected by our server we got up to leave, upon seeing the owner on leaving wanted to let him know about WHAT A HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE HE HAS, he continued to tell us we were NOT respected, too young to have an opinion (mind you my friend speaking is 29). Nice try bro, we have corporate credit cards, you messed up with your age profiling. missed out on an unlimited budget *tisk *tisk douche"}
{"text":"The worst Dinner I have ever been served!  We started off with Fried Calamari - just OK at best!  Salad was out of a bag and the dressing tasted like someone had fun with garlic and red onions.  Really overpowered the salad.  I personally tried the Minestrone and I must say it was horrible!  It looked like the had thrown pieces of pasta in with their marinara sauce, I have never tasted anything like it.  We had one order of Chicken Parmigiana a bit greasy and the sauce tasted like out of a can with a bunch of spices in it.  It was served over rigatoni, well I would say pieces of rigatoni.  It appears the use the left over pieces to put as the sides.  I was the brace one and ordered the Angel Hair Bolognase, oh my I can't begin to explain the taste.  Visually it looked like they had chopped up a meatball the sausage was sold old it was hard.  I sent it back immediately and No I did not order anything to replace it.  The server didn't seem surprised.  He just said OK. I get it when it is Spring Training this place is cool because of their memorabilia but their food is that of a cheap buffet and their prices are that of a nice Italian Restaurant.  Maybe if people would stop going their and they would start caring they would taste their food and get some new Cooks."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous lunch at Italian Grotto.  It is in a perfect location and we found it while walking in Old Town Scottsdale.  The posted menu showed \"Gluten Free Pasta\" so I was immediately sold.  It was a penne pasta and it was perfect.  Our table was right next to the open doors to the sidewalk, so we had a great view and enjoyed watching people enjoying the outdoors.   Our server was Jason and he was terrific.  We had a cocktail prior to our lunch and I thought the Long Island Iced Tea was great.   They had some very cool \"Uber Eats\" ads that are cell phone chargers- great idea. We really had a great meal and enjoyed looking at the sports memorabilia."}
{"text":"Unlike the other negative reviews, I liked the owner, the server was great, the ambiance was wonderful and the food was fantastic.  The Halibut Piccata, while delicious, was a little pricey at $30 for a lunchtime entree in the middle of the old west so i took off one star."}
{"text":"If you look at my two other Yelp reviews, you will see positive reviews of a couple of restaurants I've been to. Normally, if a restaurant is lame, which is rare, I won't even review it. But I am going to enjoy eviscerating this truly repulsive restaurant, not for the food, which was somewhat edible, but for the dishonest pricing and for the jerk who apparently owns the place.  My girlfriend Carol and I were walking through Scottsdale. It was just past noon on a recent Sunday so we were thinking about lunch. We passed Italian Grotto and saw a menu posted outside on the wall. The \"lunch\" part of the menu had most entrees at $8. \"I'll treat you to lunch,\" she said. \"Sounds good,\" said I.  We went in and there were very few customers. Three or four people were sitting at the bar. We were seated quickly. The server, who was polite, brought us menus. The first thing we noticed was that there were no $8 items on it. All of the lunch items were priced at $13 or more. So we asked the server about the menu on the outside of the building. Here's what he said: \"Yes, those are $8 items if you get them al la carte.\" Of course, al la carte suggests that you can get, say, the baked ravioli for $8 if you get nothing else on the side. But then the server added \"But these items do come with either soup or salad.\" Hmmm? It clearly sounded like he was saying the lunch special was $8 and you still got a soup or salad. Carol and I looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. I ordered the baked ravioli, she ordered a vegetable pasta dish.(Each of these were $8 on the outside menu but $13 on the menu he handed us. He clearly intimated that we were ordering items as a \"lunch special\".) We also ordered  a side of garlic bread and one iced tea. That's all we ordered.  As we awaited our meals, there was some person standing around the lobby and I heard him say something loudly about \"Jews\", which got my attention. He seemed drunk and a couple of the servers were standing around him so I thought \"some idiot\"...and tuned him out. (And remember, this was just after noon!)   The food arrived and was fine. I got exactly four medium-sized ravioli on my plate, along with a salad. The drunk guy was quiet but still standing around the lobby like he owned the place. He looked a bit like Donald Trump, same age and attitude, and he wore a couple of rather large gold earrings in his left ear. As it turned out, this inebriated jerk WAS the owner!   After we ate, we got the check and were shocked to see that it totaled $40. Not only that, but the entrees were written down as $14 each. What kind of weird mistake was this? Carol, who doesn't mind confronting issues like this, had me wait at the table while she went to find the waiter.Then I heard the loud-mouthed owner yapping at her. I did not hear what he was saying but it sounded, at a distance, like he was arguing with her. As my attention turned to him, my girlfriend laughed a couple of times and I thought it must be alright. (Carol is from Long Island and is used to New York attitudes so I figured all was good.) This one-sided conversation lasted 5 minutes or so. Then she came back with the bill and rolled her eyes saying \"Let's get outta here.\"  As it turned out, the owner only deducted that extra two dollars from the bill (from $14 to $13 per entree) and, according to Carol, he reeked of alcohol and acted drunk. And obnoxious. He asked her to \"Get a load of the queers at the bar!\" And that was just the beginning of his tirade.  She said that the owner wondered why I, the boyfriend, wasn't paying the bill and that \"no woman should pay when a man can pay. I have six daughters and if they ever had to pay for a meal on a date, the boyfriends would never be welcome in the house!\" Carol, thinking that the guy was just trying to act like a macho New Yorker, told him that she was from Long Island. In response he said \"Long Island isn't New York! Only spoiled brats live on Long Island. I grew up in Manhattan, in Chelsea, on 29th and 9th!\"   He asked Carol why we were in Scottsdale. She said, \"We live in Tucson and have been visiting Arcosanti.\" He said \"Why would you live in Tucson? It's a dump! I had a bagel business on 1st Ave. in Tucson and it was a terrible place!\" He also added, \"I was at Arcosanti a few years ago and it was dirty and hippies lived there.\" I suppose this was the point in the conversation when Carol laughed and walked away.  As we were walking back to our car and Carol was relating this story, we knew that this information needs to get out. And seeing what many others have written about this restaurant, I think you can see we aren't exaggerating.   The drunken owner of Italian Grotto is a misanthrope named Gary Horowitz (so why his comment about Jews?!) and no one should be supporting his business.  also see: http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2001-05-03/restaurants/veni-vici-vendetta/full/"}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch here today.  First I have to say that the food was pretty good.  The one star is because we all felt taken advantage of.   My wife is in the hospital here and we took a much deserved break for lunch.  We talked to the waiter and thought we had a good rapport with him.  He and the chef who came out were very nice to us .   He said that all of the pasta dishes were  $8 for lunch and would we like soup or salad.   Also when two of us ordered a glass of wine he recommended one and brought the bottle so we could have a sample.  In the end we ended up getting charged for the whole bottle of wine and extra for soup and salad.  What should have been a reasonable meal ended up costing over  $150!  We thought we had asked enough questions ahead but this was clearly \"bait and switch\".  Be warned.  It was obvious that they took advantage of the situation."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews about the demeanor of the manager/owner and saved myself some time.  Came in for lunch on Friday, was seated and provided a menu.  We were planning a dinner out so asked for lunch sized portions.  $ off if you order from here to here on the menu, smaller.  Ok, I have the angel hair bolognese.  The owner rather than telling me they do not do that as a lunch he said spaghetti with meat sauce.  I guess it could be called that so said yes.  It went down from there.  There was anther altercation with a young lady about a $100 gift certificate.  You can't use that here, she left her meal that was just served. The manager/owner then said she was drunk to other customers.  Seemed perfectly good to me and explained the place had changed hands recently to my wife, before she left.  This kind of thing seems typical from other comments below.  There are too many fine places to go without being subjected to nonsense at a meal."}
{"text":"I'm happy that I didn't bother to research this gem on Yelp before trying it. I'm shocked by the rating here.  I found everything from the food, most of the staff, to the ambience to my liking. I felt as if I were in an old school New York Italian restaurant.  The menu overwhelmed me initially.  Because I love Italian fare, it was difficult to make a selection. After the hotess described the house specials, I decided immediately.  I settled on a delicious scallops dish. The pasta and scallops were both cooked perfectly. I was beyond pleased.  The ambience: dim lightning with candles at each table, the warm interaction between the staff and diners, Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday serving as the backdrop. Such fun!  Meatball, our waiter was very accomodating and a true gentleman.  My only issue: I would like to go back and sit at what seemed to be an ambly stocked bar; but the bartender was so loud and obnoxious that I wouldn't dare. In fact, when I return, I will ask for a table furthest from the bar in order not to hear him at all."}
{"text":"ENTIRELY over priced for what is served (a basic, bland Cesar salad with no frills for $20 - really!?) The chicken parm was OK. I could also tell they use powdered garlic on their bread, no bueno! It's time to step up your game - fresh is always best.   We visited after a reservation mix up at one of the local eateries, and decided to give it a chance even though I wasn't impressed upon walking in. A quirky place with old decor and no sense of ambiance and the lingerings of a musty ash tray. The host/owner was friendly but this review is based solely on the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was with a group looking for a place to eat.  We eventually stopped outside this establishment, where we encountered an incredibly rude host at the front door who completely scared us off after meeting him.  Apparently we were loitering around the entrance too much for his liking, because he tossed some choice insults with very colorful language our way, which I won't bother repeating here.  Needless to say we quickly left for better prospects.  After reading some other reviews here, apparently this was the owner!  I just wanted to reiterate how incredibly impolite and ill-mannered the staff at the front door was, and I shudder to think of what service must be like inside.  I would avoid this place at all costs, and I honestly can't believe they are in business if this is how they treat prospective customers."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I used to come here a few years back when I was in the area frequently on business.  Stopped by when I was on vacation this time and I was not disappointed.  The food was great as well as the staff.  Good thing I ignored the bad yelp reviews, I was concerned things had changed.  Nothing changed just awesome Italian food, that reminded me of being on the east coast."}
{"text":"Luckily i didnt let the outside scare me away. The food was delicious...Chicken Picatta was so flavorful and juicy."}
{"text":"Can I give negative stars?  My boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said \"here's your check please pay and leave.\" I said \"Excuse me\" and he responded \"You are a waste of space at my bar.\" I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded \"are you serious?\" All he said was \"Leave\" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, \"Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway.\" As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said \"I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!\" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me."}
{"text":"This is a go to restaurant for our family. The atmosphere is comfortable for any group. We come here for birthday celebrations, after spring training, or even as a relaxing family dinner with the kids.    The staff is always friendly, accomodating, and efficient.   I have never had a bad meal here. I have a couple of go to meals, but anything with their homemade red sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Some of the best Seafood in old town. The clams and mussels in cream sauce is a must try appetizer. The house salad and bread are perfect. I also suggest you try the Chilean Sea Bass."}
{"text":"As Avery said you have to have a sense of humor when visiting the Grotto! It's an old school \"Joint\". The owner cares about his restaurant, he is there every day stewing up sauces, checks the quality of food being delivered and goes around and makes sure everyone is happy with their meal. I am in very often and I had an off menu item....Salad, Romaine with warm grilled chicken in scampi garlic sauce with fresh cheese sprinkled......Best salad I have ever had and I eat a fair amount of salads around the valley. Get to know Gary, Doogie and the other staff....they play old school music, have some sports memorobilia, sports tv's in the bar and it's just a comfortable relaxing atmosphere with outdoor seating in Old Town Scottsdale. I will go out of my way to eat there!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place zero stars! The food was not bad but if you like to be treated rudely and enjoy crappy service then this is a place for you! Right when we were seated my husband wanted to get up and leave but we were in a large group so out of respect for everyone else who was hungry in our group we stayed."}
{"text":"Should have read the review before coming.    I was in Scottdale for business, and the local hotel recommended Italian Grotto for dinner.  We called ahead to see if we can make a reservation, they told us there aren't any reservations available, but the walk-in wait time is only 10 minutes.  Upon arriving (5 minute drive), the front desk person told us it would be at least a 30 minutes wait.  Fine, maybe a few large parties decided to show up between the time we called and when we arrived.  After 30 minutes, we were finally seated.  After being seated, we waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to stop by with water.  It took another 10 minutes for him to come back with the water and the menu for us to order.  By then, we have waited for a good 30 minutes before putting in our orders.    We ordered fried calamari and zucchini, spaghetti w/ meatballs, sausage and peppers, and the shrimp scampi.  The waiter somehow messed up our order where our entree came out first without any appetizers.  After 10 minutes, we asked about the waiter to cancel the appetizers as we were already finishing our entrees.  The waiter said he would check, but came back with our appetizers 10 minutes afterwards.  To summarize our experience:  Good: 1. Great location, in the heart of old town  Bad: 1. Poor management - misjudged/misspoke wait-time just to get more business 2. Slow Waiters - it takes him at least 10 minutes to come back to our tables.  Took over 30 minutes to put in order despite us asking to order 3. Bad waiter attitude - even after making the mistake of not putting in our appetizer, the waiter would not own up and cancel our order.  Came back 10 minutes afterwards with our appetizers when we already finished our entrees 4. Mediocre food - everything was extra salty  Overall, would not recommend anyone coming here.  So many other places to go with better service and food."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were in Scottsdale for a conference and didn't want to stay at the mixer that night so we went to Old Scottsdale to look for a restaurant to eat.  Italian Grotto was dark and crowded...it must be good.  The restaurant had a great garlic smell to it...I know why. It's the delicious garlic toast! The garlic toast had real diced chunks of garlic on top of the grilled bread! SO freaking awesome.  The Caesar salad was also the bomb because they add in anchovies...yum!   Our server was great too...bubbly and energetic.   What I didn't like too much about this place is the lack of pasta options. It was mainly ravioli, cannelloni, and lasagna."}
{"text":"Italian Grotto used to be a favorite and my family has been going back for over 10 years but now we are done. It's time for this place to close down! The last 2 times we've eaten there, the food quality was awful and the owner was rude and snippy. When I walked in the last time the owner literally said \"what do you want\". I told him we had a reservation which he was less ham enthusiastic about. I waited at the bar for the rest of my party where I paid $9 for well vodka! Then when my party got there and wanted to sit outside he made rude comments to them. We should have left at this point. My meal was scallop pasta, the scallops were so over cooked they tasted fried and there was a small amount of noodles swimming in a bland creamy sauce ($26). My brother had ravioli, came as 4 small ravioli that he said tasted like the frozen ones he makes at home. Tiny portion and he was still starving ($15). I gave them another chance after the last bad meal but this was too much! I hope they go out of business soon so something decent can take its place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! and a waste of $400  I have visited your restaurant on two previous occasions and I was pleased with your food and overall experience.  It's been a year since my last visit and you have changed for the worse.  We brought visitors from out of state and today's dinner was an embarrassment to my husband and I. The quality of the food was very poor,  below average standards.  Plain Cesar Salad (soggy , wet lettuce, with mostly anchovy flavor), plain butter pasta (loaded with garlic when specifically requested simple), cold soup, shoe bottom Veal Piccata drenched in a whole bottle of capers on a bed of soupy olive oil stepped on vegetables, salty, a side dish of vegetables was a mushed up serving of again the same stepped on vegetables, the Tiramisu was overwhelmed by a thick cream that did not taste like mascarpone at all.  The cook , chef needs some direction."}
{"text":"Pretty middle of road Italian spot.  The food is overpriced for what you get - I assume because it is in such a prime Old Town location.   We sat in the back near the entrance to the kitchen. The ambience was..eclectic..to put it nicely. I feel like the paintings and oddly silver finished walls just didn't fit together. It didn't help that the place was dark, dingy, and a bit dirty (especially in the hallway near the kitchen and in the bathrooms). Some touristy food locations upsell you for the ambience .. we quickly learned this wasn't one of those places.  The food wasn't terrible. I went with baked cheese-stuffed ravioli. The sauce was great and the portions were good. I have to note that my starter salad was put together pretty oddly. They basically just dumped a huge dollop of blue cheese on top of a few pieces of lettuce and called it a day. A little bit of a rip of and just lazy service in my opinion.  Server was a bit pushy, but I wouldn't say rude. Overall, timely service and he didn't mess up anything. He actually ran out of the restaurant and chased us down the street because I forgot to sign the receipt - oops!  Our bill came out to close to $70..for 2 glasses of house wine, garlic bread, and 2 of some of the cheapest pasta dishes on the menu!  Sadly, after our mediocre experience and after reading  tons and tons of the other negative reviews, I do not think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Thrilled with our dinner. Did not intend to eat here, but our restaurant of choice was closed until 5:00pm and we wanted an early dinner. We are so happy the other place was closed. Definitely worth trying. Authentic old school Italian. Wonderful end to a great day."}
{"text":"I have walked passed the Italian grotto and have always loved the smells coming from this restaurant, the music is great and the ambiance is inviting. I didn't have resevations and decided to try to get in and try this place.  I had my kid with me and we were welcomed in, seated at a great window seat immediately and offered an appetizer.  I was told about some favorites and ordered the clams portinfino and my kid ordered the chicken fetticucini alfredo.  It was amazing...wish i had ordered the sausage and peppers cause it looked so good.. all the orders around us looked great.  Just gives me another reason to come back again and again.  I was surprised that I was able to get in without a resevation and they were so accommodating.  Great job Grotto!  I will be back"}
{"text":"The food here was good but the energy was not. The way the owner and other blonde lady spoke us was terrible and disrespectful. They used lots of sarcasm or lady rolled her eyes. The lady who brought our food out was so miserable and mean. If you want to go somewhere that you don't feel welcomed then here's the place for you. My family and I felt like the biggest inconvenience and felt bad for the other servers. They literally rushed us out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The owner was the rudest man I have ever encountered.  I have been in the restaurant business my whole life and have never been treated so bad in my life.  He actually told me and my friends to get the F--- out of his restaurant.  He said we couldn't eat in his restaurant.  All we did was walk in.  He used the F word 3 times. I was embarrassed and shocked.  I really hope karma bites his in the ass."}
{"text":"I like this little Italian place in the heart of old towne. Great service, even better food. Feels like an old school place in New York. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. Every single person we encountered was unfriendly and seemed very unhappy to be there. The menu sucks. Haven't even ate yet but I bet the food will suck too. 0/10 recommend unless you want to feel degraded the entire time."}
{"text":"Rock solid traditional Southern Italian fare.  House-made pastas and sausage.  Great Service.  The owner goes out of his way to make sure that you're satisfied.  Solid wine list."}
{"text":"Honestly I really do enjoy the food here because of how delicious it always has been but, it was my first Mother's Day with my son ... With another baby on the way only a month along ... I walked up to the host stand with my stroller ... Talked to a waitor and he said one moment then afterwords ... An older man with slicked back greasy hair walks up, slurping down water slamming it down and asked what it was I was doing ... I then proceeded to tell him I had been helped ... I honestly didn't know whom he was because he was sloppy and was not dressed as a host would be, anyways he then proceeds to be rude and tell me \"your gonna something and move out of the way\" and I looked at him as my blood pressure and hormones levels went up... The. Again says \" don't look at me like that I have 5 daughters don't be mad at me \" .... I literally have him a look but Honestly what business owner speaks to customers like that. My mother finally arrived to find me even more disturbed ... My 11 month old needed a high hair and they only have ONE... Not kid friendly at all!!! They made me feel uncomfortable for having to out my child in his stroller! Needless to say they have the table next to me the highchair and never offered it to me after the last person had used it!!! It ruined my dinner all together! My mother knew who I was talking about when I explained what had happened because this man whom apparently is from Chicago/ New York is a jackass to all his customers and even has had the nerve to tell others to turn there cell phones off as my mother explained that happened over spring training ... Just a side note from one New Yorker to another you make all of us look bad with your poor attitude ... You don't like your job get a new one!!! I didn't even want to spend my money at your establishment and your lucky my pregnant hormonal ass was craving your food or else I would have given you a true New Yorkers attitude ... I will never step foot in there after this experience .... If you have children I would advice not to go there as well!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Italian with a great right-on-the-corner atmosphere look no further than The Grotto (and by that I mean stop wasting your money at Bucca).  My absolute favorite on the menu is the chicken parmesan. The cut is lean and fried to perfection, topped with delicious mozzarella and served with pasta with \"tastes like it was made back East\" red sauce."}
{"text":"The Italian Grotto is not a fancy place to go for arugula and pretend you are a gourmet connoisseur. This is authentic home made --large plates-- the way good Italian mamas do it at home.  Pricey? Not really, you get what you pay for. Waiters that enjoy as much has you do what you eat, priceless, and for those who have been made fun off  enjoy, learn and be grateful, in essence great food and good vino.  The true joy of Italian life.  Salute"}
{"text":"Rude, disgusting and distasteful and that's just the owner/manager. The food is horrible too. Skip it and go to Olive Garden"}
{"text":"The four of us went there on a Friday night and were treated like gold. Harvey our server was amazing and really made the experience enjoyable with his banter and personality.   The food was delicious. Each of us liked our dish so much that we shared with each other and argued over which was the best... we never decided on which one won. Because we were discussing how much we all like minestrone soup, Harvey bought a bowl for the table so we could try it. It was delicious food and such genuinely good service.   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for an Itilain restaurant in downtown Scottsdale. It's kitchy and has a feel that's not too fancy, but the food and service feel as if you were in the most upscale of places. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow why have I lived here 6 years and never been to this place let alone why has nobody informed me that I must go????  This place is straight outta New York food quality is awesome and I love the attitude of the staff.  I totally recommend making reservations because this place is packed and for a good reason.     I went with a party of 7 and we got seated and our drink orders were taken I had a glass of Pinot Noir which was very good and went excellent with the fried calamari I had.  They say award winning calamari and I see why I honestly don't like calamari usually but I went to town on this stuff.  The marinara sauce is spicy and full of flavor just an amazing way to start a meal.  For my entree I got the Chicken Cutlet Parmigiana which was awesome.  I have to thank the yelpers for the suggestion on that one they were all right it was fried to perfection and the pasta and sauce on the side was excellent.    I wish I had room for dessert as I am sure they are good but my wallet and stomach had enough for the evening so I will have to venture back again very soon.    This place is expensive but worth it and it's nice to have a true Italian place to go to that isn't cookie cutter Bucca or others."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!!!! I only gave it a three star rating due to the fact that I LOVE baseball! It was an awesome atmosphere. The staff was a tad bit rude and unfriendly. The food wasn't too bad. I wasn't happy with my chicken marsala especially the portion that was served. My \"kick ass\" wine was fabulous and the calamari was delicious. My friend's were happy with their meals."}
{"text":"Probably one of the greatest Italian spots i have been too. Food is awesome, staff is friendly and attentive. Good atmosphere. Menu is pretty extensive and wine list is good as well. Nice place for a romantic dinner with someone special, low lights and good music!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state and saw an Italian place  to eat.  I normally don't  do reviews...but this place so yuck.  Had the scallops and they were chewy and fishy smelling.  Repeated my lunch the rest of the day and also the bathroom.  Would not recommend this place.  Way over priced for pasta."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like it belongs on the show Bar Rescue.   We were in old town late last night and looking for a place to eat. My father-in-law decided we step in to try the place. First impressions: The place is extremely dated and has an odd artsy/Italian feel. The waiting staff was nice and had good attitudes but they looked sloppy; shirts untucked, baggy clothing, etc. Our table was wobbly but our waiter got down on his hands and knees to put some towels under it to balance it out..  The menus need some refreshing and updating. We were handed paper menus with food stains and torn edges. The prices were ridiculous. Most entrees ranged from 21-34. We all ordered pasta, which was mediocre at best, and a whopping $14 per plate. I get that it's Scottsdale but come on, I could get far better tasting food at Olive Garden.  There was a gentleman sitting at the bar who I'm guessing to be the owner? Having a little much to drink, he was talking loud and flirting with customers while ordering drinks and refilling water glasses. Several employees were babysitting him during our visit attempting to control him. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is extremely sub par. If you order a salad you will get barely cut lettuce with dressing, no other fixings. Not sure you can call that a salad especially for the extra cost on my wife's dinner. The rest of it is bland. God forbid you bring a stroller because they will make you sit in the back of the restaurant away from the rest of the guests. Terrible experience. We had to pick up other food on the way home and still spent $80 on food for two. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"I got turned away at the door because my whole party wasn't with me... at 3 PM when the restaurant was half empty. Then our server was wearing a hat and sunglasses inside, seemed pretty baked, was hard to understand, and just kind of underperformed based on Old Town standards. The food was marginal at best, but it was pretty bland. Scottsdale prices for food Olive Garden could easily beat. Just bad."}
{"text":"Terrible place...We were sat by a grungy older man who didn't even say hello. On the way to our table, he stopped and reprimanded a waiter in the middle of the patio. We just stood there - uncomfortable! Our waiter was rude- He kept leaving the table in the middle of our order to go to other tables and would not let us finish our sentences. Halfway through the meal the older man (who we figured out is the owner or manager) had an argument with 2 of the employees and then got in his truck and sped out dropping f bombs at the employees. (Sitting on the patio, we had front row seats to the drama) - We felt like there were hidden cameras and we were on a prank tv show or something! WOW! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE....unless you enjoy spending 200 dollars in under an hour and geting told to leave by  the crack head alcoholic owner. After spending less than an hour and still with wine in our glasses - he walked up and  pulled the table back away from us and said to leave because he had a \"wait\". I had been there several times and used to reccomend this place but NO way now. I told him that I would no longer support his restaurant with horrible service like that and his response was (in front of my guests and other tables around):  \"You think I care? Look at my wait, get the hell out. Go get laid and quit busting my balls.\"  I hope people don't support service like that because there are a ton of other restaurants in Scottsdale with better service and better food....."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice as a family place but Henry on staff is dishonest. Tried to Telly table and I that \"something in the salad\" is an anchovy. I took a picture and posted it. It's a cockroach! We left without finishing/paying...so gross."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We had the mussels which were superb & the fried mozzarella was amazing. Definitely both are a must when you visit. The owner who sat us down was also very welcoming & warm. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Don't run a restaurant if you don't know what good customer service is. The man running it when we went in was very rude. When I told him it was unnecessary to be rude, he proceeded to tell me to shut my mouth and called me stupid. I have never experienced anything like that in my life. Save your money and go someplace else."}
{"text":"Apparently my review has been deleted. I am shocked. Even the review of the man  Who agreed was deleted?????!! What a horrible experience we had with a party of 8 on march 10th. The owner who  Was drinking beers was rude and extremely unprofessional. Who tells a party of 8 after waiting 45 min that they won't be seated because they asked if the table was ready? Really??? Do not go to this restaurant. Horrible."}
{"text":"How this place remains open is beyond me. I asked for food to go and was told, \"No take-out it's the season\". Then he asked \"What are you ordering?\" I asked for Linguine & Clam sauce and a Fettuccine Alfredo. He told me \"We don't have any clams\". He then offered me Fettuccine & an order of Spaghetti & Meatballs. I said ok and ten minutes later I got three containers of \"food\". No utensils, no napkins, no bread. I got two God-awful Fettuccine Alfredo's one of which had two meatballs. A salad drenched in olive oil and no vinegar. You know the phrase \"Food so good you want to slap your Mother\"? I'd like to slap the owner and everyone in their \"kitchen\" Avoid at all costs,. When you want Italian food really bad, go here because it really is really bad. One star is too much can you post negative stars ? If so minus 5."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped in for dinner last Sunday at around 6:30.  We were seated immediately and our server for the evening was Meatball.  He was a pretty funny guy and I knew from the reviews to expect a little bit of sass.  We got plenty of that, but he also had some really helpful suggestions regarding the menu.  Some of the other reviews were pretty spot on about this place, especially the one about them turning their salads into soup.  You better like a little bit of salad with your dressing!  I'm kind of curious how much attitude you'd get if you asked for it on the side.  In any case, it wasn't really a big deal because I liked their house dressing.  As far as entrees, my friends both ordered chicken dishes and I had the mussels portofino.  My dish was excellent, heavy on the garlic, just the way I like it.  I'd come back again if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before we went in. I can tell you that the staff was very friendly including the owner. I read a lot of complaints about being treated rudely but we were treated very well.    I felt very rushed. Appetizers came out quickly and main course within a minute or two.  The food was mediocre at best. Not a place I would recommend or ever go back to."}
{"text":"Based on the variety of reviews the place might be hit or miss, however the night I was there it was great. The service at the bar and from the waiter, was great. The food itself was fresh, I had the sea bass special and it was great. The marinara sauce served with the calamari was probably some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Visited this place this afternoon, food was OK but utensils was dirty, napkins where they serve bread was dirty. Don't want to touch salt and paper at all. Next time for sure will skip this restaurant. Service was not good, people from other tables looking for forks from other empty tables."}
{"text":"One star is generous. $10 per Cannoli and the filling tasted like vanilla pudding, not cheese. My wife ordered scallops and they were not prepared correctly (breaded, rather than fried with garlic and lemon). We ordered \"tomato toast,\" which we thought was their version of bruschetta. We were served about 10 pieces of horrific garlic bread with a slice of Roma tomato on each with a side of jar spaghetti sauce. The experience was awful and before tip it was $77--no alcohol and my wife drank water. McDonald's would have been better."}
{"text":"This is a very popular place for baseball  enthusiasts with memorabilia on the walls. Food, drinks and service was good. The atmosphere is a little bit on the dark decor but fun. It's located at Old Town Scottsdale, walking distance to the SF Giants spring training stadium."}
{"text":"Italian Grotto sucks!  Watered down Spaghetti sauce, Cantaloni that had the consistancy of MUD and tasted like week old gym socks. To top it off,  we sat at the bar and had to endure a few of the \"regulars\", drunk and obnoxious assholes who we found out were friends with the owner Gary. Don't waste your time here folks, the food stinks and it just has an ugly bad vib."}
{"text":"Super rude waiter. Wouldn't do two separate checks because I'm on an expense report don't waste your time!  Awful!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. I ordered gluten free spaghetti because I have a sensitivity to gluten and repeated multiple times that I wanted spaghetti and not ziti. They said of course. Then, then brought me ziti. I asked them if they could please take it back and give me spaghetti. They said no there was nothing they could do and were extremely rude. They would not take it off our bill even though I would not eat it. would never eat here again or recommend to anyone!!! Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Do not step through the door!  I showed up to dine alone on a bustling Friday night. I stated I was here to dine alone and the grease ball maitre d replied, \"not tonight.\" I said excuse me? He replied again, \"not tonight!\" I explained that I wanted to be seated for dinner and asked if I could sit at the bar, without looking he said, \"there a no bar stools available and I'm being nice.\" If that is his version of \"being nice,\" then I think my money is best spent where I can receive good service.  Do not patronize this establishment!"}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant before, and the food has always been delicious.  The waiter on the other hand, had the personality of a teaspoon.  Not once were we asked if everything's ok...it was as if he just didn't care.  My boyfriend ordered hot tea...not an unusual request, to which he responded not tonight in a very gruff tone of voice.  I heard another table order coffee, to which he said the same thing.  I can't say I understand his behavior, seeing the fact that I have spent several years in the food service industry...I guess I hold other servers to a higher expectation, but this guy was TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was good. For the price of the food, I expected it to be hot. Our food was average, tasted like what you can make at home. Definitely not worth the price!"}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews. The owner seated us. He is as rude and arrogant as others have mentioned. I ordered the steak salad. He was out of steak. He says it's because the steak is so popular. I think it's because they didn't stock it. The soup and garlic toast were tasteless. The soup was lukewarm as if it had been sitting out. After a while I felt like this had to be some sort of joke. The dated restaurant, the dirty bathroom, the attitudes, and the bad food. But when the check came, the joke was on me. You are better off anywhere else."}
{"text":"Came in here on Parada del Sol to grab a quick bite. They were fairly busy but we were seated immediately. Nice atmosphere and the staff all seem very helpful to eachother. Almost like they've all been part of this team for a long time. Terence was our server and was just fantastic. He knows the menu very well and his suggestions were spot on. I had the spaghetti and meatballs, sister had Chilean sea bass with spinach ravioli and friend had chicken piccata. All of it fabulous. The bread and butter were awesome too. The salad dressings are so freaking good. I got house italian with blue cheese. Yumtown! The salad was fresh,cold and came with marinated onions of some sort. We all just loved it. The owner came over and said hi and really made us feel like we were regulars.....and I'm thinking we just might be."}
{"text":"Above average Italian food! Not the absolute best Italian food I've ever had, but great none the less!!  Service was good, we got seated quickly and appetizers were out in decent time. Fun atmosphere with lots of sports memorabilia. I've been here several times and always enjoyed it. Bathrooms could use some work though."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything  at the Italian Grottoit is all good. Started out with calamari, than on to the house salad with a really good house dressing. Pasta with Bolognese sauce. The special that day was a halibut that was over the top. Spumoni ice cream and cappuccino's completed a really lovely lunch. Oh yes we will be back"}
{"text":"The location is great. The side wall opens to the street for a patio feel. The service was ok...the 5 of us didn't get menus for at least 5 minutes after we sat down and it was 2:00 on Sunday afternoon. Lot of flies, probably (hopefully) due to open windows. The food was basic, nothing to note. The caesar dressing was really fishy."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews when I dine out of town but I wanted to share my experience to inform anyone who might have dietary restrictions.  As an avid traveller, I have eaten in many establishments from mom and pop hole in the wall restaurants to top of the line fine dining from Seattle to California.  This place has the potential to be the place to dine in old Scottsdale with an awesome location and great patio, and old school charm, I have to say that was the main reason we stopped in.  I agree completely with the other reviewers that you should check your bill before paying because the bill is filled in by hand so you really have to know your prices or else you could be paying more than what the menu price is.  Really, a restaurant in the heart of Old Scottsdale should be electronic in 2015.  To start, no host, just an older fellow in street clothes (Jimmy Hendrix golf shirt) wandering the parameter of the patio and inside, and a heavy set gentleman tending to obvious regulars, over zealous as he was, seemed like a nice guy, that is if you were a regular...\"how's you's doin? You's need anyting else?\" as I overheard.  Our waiter was nice enough, older guy who was just ok, but felt that he kept trying to up-sell us on booze and on bread...I'm off carbs but my husband gave in and we agreed. We specifically asked that there be no pork in any of the dishes, and was assured that won't be an issue.  Starter salad was way overdressed and was basically bagged lettuce mix with one slice of cucumber. Hello tomatoes? Onions? Olives? Anyone? Fail.  I tried the tomato cheese bread, because it looked really good and who doesn't love gooey, melty cheese? It was good but definitely not worth the $8 price tag for 4 small pieces, sauce was really acidic and the tomatoes on the bread were obviously canned.   The entrees all arrived with a pasta, while there was a veg option, we were never offered this and was told after the fact that I should have asked for it. Luckily my sons dish came with little chunks of bacon so he ended up eating the side of pasta that came with my dish ( it was not mentioned anywhere in the description but we made sure to mention it when ordering the spaghetti and meat sauce for my other son, that there is not not be any pork in any of the dishes.) I ordered the steak of the day which was supposed to be a ribeye (it was not...and it was way over done) no sides with the steak just a slab of meat swimming in a butter lemon sauce.   The waiter was nice enough to offer to make another dish for my kid without the bacon but seemed upset, when we pointed out the obvious mistake.  Then we noticed big meat chunks in the spaghetti in my other kids dish and he assured us that it was not pork...I wasn't buying it because it was very white in color and at this point I cut it open in front of him and showed him the color- said he was sure that they only use beef.  I just had to take his word for it and accept this entire dining experience as an expensive lesson learned.    Bill was just under $100 with no drinks/booze, one app and 3 dishes...I later realized that $5 was tacked on to cover my sons starter salad even though he couldn't eat his meal because of the bacon- it's not a big deal but felt that was really tacky when it was obviously their mistake.  Getting nickel and dimed and skepticism for what really was in our food is enough for me to not go back,"}
{"text":"Made a reservation but they did not honor it. Employees kept dismissing me when I would try to talk to them. One of there employees very rudely told me to stand back when I was simply trying to ask about my reservation. If the food is good, I wouldn't know but the service was absolutely lousy."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant!  Now you should know, it is not for the faint of heart, or easily offended.  This is truly a good old-fashioned back-east style Italian restaurant.  There is plenty of \"attitude\" from the wait staff, but it's all in good fun, without it the experience just wouldn't be the same.    My favorite dish is the Shrimp Fra Diavlo.  I am told every time I order it that, \"I am too white, to get it that hot.\"  It's good for a giggle and then I get the best food I have found in the valley.  We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service/mediocre food. Owner is RUDE as eff!! This man needs to learn The Golden Rule. I thought I was being punked, or having a nightmare from hell. I stupidly gave this joint a second chance (everyone has a bad day) but if you work in customer service, suck that bad mood up, and be a decent human being! I heard the OWNER CUSS at patrons and demand they leave. My server rolled his eyes because my friend and I shared a meal. This place is THE WORST!!!! Shame on The Grotto!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is New York Italian style restaurant with everything New York. The owner, Gary,  is a class act making sure EVERY guest is attended too. I think I found the best bartender in Old Town in TR. He excels at what you want in a bartneder. The service is great and the food is just perfect. I had Chilean Sea Bass and Manicotti . Both were perfect. I love the sauce they have here and found this great place to pop in for light meal and a drink before hanging out . I highly recommend this to all and make sure you enjoy the love here, its just great."}
{"text":"OMG, I love this place!  Every time I come to Old Town Scottsdale I have to eat here!  Great martinis and fabulous food!  Ask for Pedro, he is the best waiter!!!    Sit by the window if you can!!!"}
{"text":"We too never got an opportunity to eat here.  After waiting at the door behind a party of 4 for about 5 minutes with no host or hostess I asked the party in front of us how long the wait was.  They said they did not know but had been waiting there for 10 mintues waiting to be greeted.    I decided to walk into the restaurant and look for some help.  I spotted a server and smiled and asked what the wait time was explaining that no one was there to greet us.  He looked as though he was going to help and started walking towards me and then past me and said they were busy.  No sorry someone will be right with you we are a little busy.  Just a rude curt get out of my way kind of attitude.    I walked right back to our party of four and said this place is rude let's get out of here.  We went to Bucca Di Beppo across the way and were greeted with big smiles and open arms.  The staff was amazing!  Shaken by my experience with the rude waiter I asked our waiter at Bucca to provide me with a duplicate receipt of our dinner bill.    I took the receipt back to Italian Grotto and wanted to speak to a manager explaining how they lost the business due to a rude waiter.  Well I never showed the receipt because again there was no host in the lobby so I proceed to walk into the restuarant to find the manager.  I was stopped by a halfbaked and drunk man with an empty bottle of wine in his hand in a gray shirt with gray hair and two diamond earrings in his ear.  He approached me and said you looking for someone.  I replied yes the owner or manager please.  He stood there and acted as though he were the person.  I asked are you the owner?  He said why are you asking me questions? I never asked you questions?  I turned to my friend and said they cannot be the owner.  I again asked and got the same response.    He ordered us out of the dining room and told us to talk to him on the tile area considered their tiny lobby.  I walked back and he was beligerent and drunk and proceeded to tell me that I was the rudest person he ever met.    Complete whackjob!  I agree that friends have to be writing these positive reviews.  Dick's Last Resort known to be rude on purpose posed as angels to this place."}
