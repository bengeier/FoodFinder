{"text":"Great chicken fingers and friendly service. No soda machine and i think the business is very new because there are no decorations on the walls."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery and it came on time however the bottom of the pizza box was wet/soggy and the pizza was falling through. The crust was so soggy that the toppings just slid right off. The fries were also undercooked and soggy when I had asked for well done. The empanada was the only thing in the right consistency. We ate the toppings because we were starving but threw the fries away. Pretty disappointing meal in the end."}
{"text":"This is an amazing local pizza joint. We have been twice now, and when we came in the second time the owner recognized us. The food is amazing, and the service is stellar. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I brought my husband in because he wanted pizza.  Once we got there, he decided on his usual, chicken fingers & fries with mozzarella sticks.  I had chicken parmesan.  The food was tasty, but don't expect fancy.  Bobby ordered his chicken with medium buffalo sauce and they came with the sauce on the side, and he prefers that they are already tossed in sauce before they're served.  They have just been open for about a week and seem to be doing a steady business so far.  We will definitely make this one of our regular \"go to\" places when we want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Excelent pizza the promo Anny  pizza regular prize and take one similar size cheese only for free in great deal chicken wings good size .... back again"}
{"text":"The worst chicken wings ever, the hamburger I ask for medium rare us a hockey puck. There isn't a minus rating but 1 star to knowledge my post."}
{"text":"Ordered a Hawaiian Calzone with ham and pineapple. You can get two servings from the one order. The food is fresh and tasty, but a little high in cost."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a couple of times.
The food comes fast and hot.
Love they have the 24\" pizza easy for party's....I could use a tad more garlic and spices on the crust by over all very tasty.
Chicken fingers and wings are great and moist.
Will definitely make this a go to take out night."}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional about the pizza.  The hawaiian pizza was ok.   Pricey for the quality.  My wife tried the gyro and even with extra meat (2.50 more) was like 4 pieces total.  And what gives with having to call in for credit card payment?  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This pizza was great! The sauce was very flavorful and the dough had a great consistency. There was ample cheese and toppings.  It wasn't too thin or too doughy and it was cooked to perfection.  We got a pepperoni pizza for my husband andI and a pineapple pizza for the kids.  Both pizzas were delicious and we will definitely go back. I called ahead to order our pizzas and the staff was very nice and our pizza was ready to go when we arrived (approx 20 min). There were other items on the menu like chicken and fries so there are other options available if you wanted more than just pizza. But honestly, try the pizza. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Close to home
Friendly staff 
Tasty pizza- I love the crust it's not too thick and not to thin it's perfect 
Decided to try jalape√±o poppers and they were yummy
I am excited to order again"}
{"text":"Finally a Local Pizza Spot Near my house!  This business opened on Saturday 03/17/18.  Located next to Dotty's on Jones & Windmill.  When I entered I was greeted with a smile and then was shown the new menu.  I love visiting new business' and this is no exception.  You can tell the owner has pride in his new endeavor.  The place is perfectly clean with all new pain and floors and everything including the bathrooms were crystal clean.   I ordered the cheese pizza and was told it would be done in 10min, it took 9min and I was gone.  When I got home it only took me another 10min. To eat half of this extra large pizza.  So much better the Little Ceasars and Pizza Hut.   Thanks again!  I will be back again using the 15% off Loyalty card that I received!"}
{"text":"Just driving by and stopped in. Not much on atmosphere, but it's a pick up a pizza to go  kinda place. Great pizza. Friendly service. The guy tanking my order apologize for taking so long... but our wasn't long. I didn't call ahead on a busy Friday night, and they fixed me up quickly.

And the pizza... delicious!"}
{"text":"Expensive and poor quality. The mozzarella sticks I could have got from a grocery store freezer. Wouldn't complain except they were $7 and they only gave us 6!! The garlic bread also came from a freezer. It was simply burnt Texas Toast. The Fettuccine Alfredo was watery and bland. The chicken added to it had zero flavor, looked like it was boiled, and was dry. The tiramisu was still frozen. It was, overall, disgusting and the biggest wast of money I have spent on a meal in a year."}
{"text":"It was a great experience, you can tell the pizza was fresh and plenty of cheese, no like other places where they charge you a lot for toppings, the empanadas they were great, oven cooked compare to fried, it was my first time, the owner was very friendly and explains the everything was homemade, they also have very nice desserts.
I will be back for more.
Thank you Alejandro, welcome"}
{"text":"I'm very unhappy I ordered a 14in Hawaiian $16.99 extra cheese 1.75  breadsticks 5.99, 2 liter of coke $3.00. Which if you do the math is 27.73. Over the phone I was quoted 37.07 which means they have a $9.34 delivery fee that not stated anywhere on the menu. They used a square app which would not let me enter my own tip value so I ended up tipping $5.56 While that wouldn't have been a problem the fact that I paid $42.63 for my order bugged me until I checked the math it just didn't seem right. The food was okay I probably would not have ordered again but with a delivery fee that is not stated of $9 I definitely would not order again."}
{"text":"Just order to go 24\" Pizza and 20 pcs of chicken wings. Pepperoni italian sausage and mushrooms my kids love pizza but when I arrived home and saw the size of the pizza they were overwhelmed by the size of it was good and the wing were good too, nothing special."}
{"text":"Got a double cheeseburger. Very hard to get that wrong, yet the quality was just not there, flavor was not there... sorry, I'll try a pizza next time(maybe) but burgers I'll pass."}
{"text":"We just live across the street so we decided to try since we want something quick. My husband and i loved and enjoyed their food so much. My husband ordered the Vacio(flap grilled meat) it came with potato salad(which he loved so much) and their chimichurri was bomb dot com!!! The meat was very well marinated and grilled to perfection. I ordered the wings it was very crispy but bland but paired very well with their sauce. This will be our new \"go to\". Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Yes, the food was a little late but it was worth the wait. My husband and I liked the burgers and the fries very much. Ate them in no time! The delivery person was very nice. Definitely enjoyed our food. The burger was big in size and filling. The fries were great. If you want a great tasting burger, order from Alejandro's Pizza & Grill!!"}
{"text":"The chicken parm dinner special is a great deal with a salad and garlic bread. The menu is very wide-ranging and the desserts look really good."}
