{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday date night; what a beautiful location! We had made reservations the day before and arrived by uber at the location. I was a bit confused where the entrance to the restaurant was as there was a wedding going on and I didn't want to wander right through someone's cocktail hour set-up! Thankfully a valet driver saw our confusion and told us to head straight back through the courtyard to the entrance. When we checked in we were fortunate enough to have the option of indoor or outdoor seating so we sat outside to enjoy the beautiful venue and location. There was a wedding going on, but they didn't seem to mind the few gawkers and onlookers in the restaurant area and it was easily separated so our dining experience was separate from the wedding party.   Our server explained the traditional Italian dining style with spuntini, antipasti and primi meant to be shared and enjoyed by everyone. We placed our drink order and enjoyed the view while perusing the menu some more. We weren't tickled by any of the spuntini and opted for the wood grilled octopus antipasti and neri with sea scallops primi. The bread basket brought to the table was very nice, and I enjoyed all of them- serving it with EVOO is nice, but just a small plate of EVOO on the table lacked a creative presentation or spice. Many upscale places I've been to will \"doctor it up\" just a bit- adding some Italian herbs or parmesan cheese if that's your thing. The octopus came out first and it was very good, I highly recommend this and it was just enough for two people. However, the squid ink neri with scallops was a 50/50 split at the table. My husband loved it, thought it tasted wonderful and was delicious. I on the other hand, thought the scallops were a tad on the fishy side, as well as the ink pasta. I've had other squid ink pastas before that were not as salty or fishy tasting. The pasta was on the cooler side, maybe it had been out for too long before serving, but I simply let my husband eat the rest of mine.   The timing of dinner was off. We waited quite a long time between the last of the primi and the start of secondi. Our server tried to play it off that she was, \"letting us enjoy our bottle of wine and the view\" but by the time the main course arrived- we had to order another bottle to ensure we had some wine with our dinner knowing that we would take the remainder home (thanks to AZ's recorking laws!) I know this sounds petty, but I found it odd that our red wine wasn't served in a red wine glass and rather the standard glasses at the table. But I digress...the timing could use some work. If by chance, any of the dishes takes longer to prepare- let me know that in advance and I will order in advance as well. There was sufficient enough downtime to make it awkward as many diners who arrived after us had already ate and left.   I had the osso bucco as my main course and my husband enjoyed the snapper. Both were very tasty and I had to take some home to enjoy the next day as it was a very large piece of meat. The dessert menu was not as traditionally Italian as I had hoped and they were out of most of the limoncello we wanted in our flight of three.   The ambience is wonderful and some of the food was a hit, some was a miss. I might give it another try and order some different dishes and a better overall experience, but for the price, it's going to be awhile."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the Branzini! Eggplant cakes were a touch salty for my liking but nonetheless good starter. The grilled octopus was prepared perfectly. Incredible selection of wines.   All you would expect from a restaurant of this stature - attentive and professional service, great ambiance for our 16 guests in a private room."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Sassi for the first time and shared the grilled octopus, veal, gnocci, and mushrooms. We didn't love the food but we did love the ambiance. Beautiful restaurant if you are looking for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"I chose Sassi as the venue for our family's Mother's Day brunch celebration expecting an excellent culinary experience. It was absolutely the worst brunch I've ever had in the Valley. A total waste of money $55 + 20% gratuity automatically added to bill + tax = $70 per person. The menu and selections were uninspiring and limited for a buffet. The bakery items were staled, hard as a rock and non edible. Breakfast frittata and quiche- like item was as cold as dog's nose and cut into bite size pieces more appropriate as pass around appetizers vs a main. Fresh fruit had an after taste like it hadn't been thoroughly washed. Kids table offered pizza that tasted worse than a supermarket frozen variety. The desserts were as disappointing as the rest of meal. Gelato was more like ice milk from a cheap ice cream spot. Horrible. Simply horrible. Don't waste your money when there are so many other wonderful spots for exquisite holiday brunches."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on our Saturday date night to Sassi up in north Scottsdale. We've been before and always had great service, amazing food and an incredible view. This time was a little different. There was a wedding in the courtyard! It was so romantic and made me want to marry my husband all over again (at Sassi this time). We sat outside under the heaters and had a roaring fire next to us. We had the Margarita pizza to start, then the gnocchi and the Sole for dinner. Our food was perfect. Needless to say it was a wonderful night! I would recommend Sassi for a date night any time!"}
{"text":"I love Sassi.  On Wednesday evenings during the summertime they hold a wine tasting with half price appetizers.  My girlfriends and I make it a regular outing and are sad that it is discontinued in the fall and winter.  That said, when I had to select a location for a business dinner, Sassi was the first place that popped into mind.  The atmosphere is what really makes Sassi special.  When you walk through the courtyard and walk through the heavy wooden doors, you know that you are going someplace special.  The restaurant is furnished like an old, Southern Italian farmhouse that is so warm and welcoming that you just don't want to leave.  The service is impeccable - our water glasses were always filled and finished plates were whisked away before you even noticed.  Our dinner party of 4 enjoyed the house specialty of homemade pasta with roasted vegetables and the grilled pork chop battuto.  The pasta was just delicious.  The pork chop was slightly dry but the braised runner beans that it was served with were amazing.  All in all, our experience at Sassi has been consistantly great.  Our guests were very happy and we will certainly be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Fabulous ambience, great service, and delicious food.  A table on the patio is spectacular, but will sit a max of 6."}
{"text":"I recently spent our 44th anniversary with a night at Sassi and had a very good meal--not a 5 star meal but very good.  The service is great, atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is very friendly.  This is probably the 10th time for us for dinner here and we have loved it each time and would highly recommend this for a special night out."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of  eating a wonderful dinner on the terrace recently. In 2008 I did not think much of the food, and in the early fall of 2009 I discovered half-price apps at the bar and was impressed. We then had a lovely table in front of a fireplace in 11/09 for my mother's 80th birthday and were again impressed. So now I'm really impressed enough to write a review, as I think the establishment has made great progress since 2008 and is now a destination restaurant.   I brought some Chicago foodie friends there, and they raved. The gnocci, the stagionale salad with LOTS of beets, flavorful shrimp with prosciutto and ceci bean salad, the hard to find in Scottsdale tender veal chop,well-prepared fish dishes without too much fluff, roasted brussel sprouts,  the wine, the ambience, and the knowledgable inobtrusive waiter-all contributed to a very enjoyable dining experience.  Don't go if you are looking for NY American Italian, as in veal parm or linguini with clams-go somewhere else for that. Go if you want relaxed fine Italian dining, inside or outside, and don't forget to hit the bar for happy hour when you want small plates and value."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place to go and spend an evening at all, it's quite, romantic and relaxing. My wife and I started going to Sassi about 2 years ago for our anniversary and our first experience was amazing. However since then our experience has been less than impressive, especially for the price. We started out the meal with an order of Polpettini which came out about 30 seconds after we ordered it, which leads me to believe they are not made to order. The flavors were ok but overall bland and unimpressive, the best part of it was dipping the bread in the meatball broth. For our first course we had the Ricotta Gnocchi in mushroom herb sauce. This was the BEST part if the meal. The gnocchi were light and fluffy, and the sauce complimented it nicely. For our main course my wife ordered the Porcini Crusted Veal Chop, and honestly for $38 was a joke, the flavor was nice but half of it was fat, so in the end we paid $38 for 5oz of veal. For myself I ordered the Pork  Ossobuco. It was ok, but very mediocre. The meat did fall right off the bone, but the flavors just weren't there. Unfortunately I just don't see us returning to Sassi anytime soon. Maybe it's us, maybe we have unrefined pallets, but I would rather spend $45 at Brio and be satisfied, then spend $100+ at Sassi feeling disappointed. Overall if I had to recommend any changes for this establishment it would be to lower their prices about 20% and consider hiring an additional chef who is a bit more bold or adventurous with their recipes. As I said earlier, our complaint isn't that the food was cooked poorly, but that it was bland and uninspiring."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend trying Sassi! The food is tasty, the atmosphere is lovely, and the staff is helpful and knowledgeable. Ask for a patio table if it's available and not too hot outside."}
{"text":"I've been interested in going to Sassi for years as I've read and heard so many great things about it, and finally we went for our anniversary. It is absolutely gorgeous, and when I went past the kitchen to find the ladies' room, the kitchen looked immaculate. Our server, Tom, was excellent--friendly, not overbearing, extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate in offering suggestions.Since I had mentioned it was our anniversary on the reservation, he started by bringing us complimentary flutes of champagne (and later we were surprised by a complimentary dessert as well--amazingly good housemade cannoli).   We took most of his suggestions--I started with the caprese and my husband with the octopus. I am a huge fan of caprese, and have measured every one I have ever had against a little restaurant in Massachusetts we used to love ages ago. This is the first time that has been surpassed. You get a six ounce ball of mozzarella, imported from Italy and you have never had such a fluffy, light cheese. My husband said the octopus was second only to Binkley's.  We next split the gnocchi, again at Tom's suggestion, and that might have been the best part of the meal. We're not usually big on gnocchi as it is so heavy and dense, being made of potato. They hand make theirs at Sassi, not out of potato, but pasta, and they are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, light, pillowy and perfectly finished with sauce and cheeese.  My main course was the salmon, wonderfully crispy from the grill, with eggplant puree, greens, friend chickpeas. I would have preferred a different kind of fish, with salmon being so common, but it was delicious. My husband got the steak with the bone marrow. It was so tender and perfectly cooked, surpassed, he claims, only by Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak in Vegas, and tied with the kobe skirt steak at Yazu Sushi in Phoenix. Believe me, we were not disappointed!  My only disappointment was the \"mood\" lighting--all we had was a candle on our table and we had a really hard time reading the menu in that small amount of light. Go to Sassi if you haven't been yet--you will thank me for it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Sassi for our anniversary.  The food we had was very good.  The building and decor were nice but I don't think I appreciated it as much as some of the people that raved about it.    My wife had the Wood Roasted Beets appetizer ($8), mint, tangerine agrumato and 20 year old Balsamic which she liked, but I thought it was just beets and it wasn't great.  I had Insalata Misticanza (salad ~ $12) Organic greens and vegetables, lemon honey vinaigrette which we both thought was very good.  It was big enough to share.    Other reviews indicated the pasta was very good, and our waiter recommended any of the three fresh, made on site, pasta dishes.  I ordered his top recommendation Orechiette con Salciccia ($20) and it was fabulous.   It had lots of spicy sausage made at the restaurant, which I loved.  My wife ordered Ricotta Gnocci ($22)  It was good too, but not as good as the Orechiette, I thought.  The chef, Peter J. DeRuvo, walked though the restaurant and stopped at our table to say hello and see if we liked the food.  He was very nice, and we enjoyed talking with him.    The waiter recommended an Italian red wine at $18 a glass that was very good.  The restaurant sent us an anniversary desert for two that was very nice.  We didn't ordered it but enjoyed it.  We were surprised when the bill came and they charged us $12 for the desert.  We happily paid for it anyway.  So be careful about telling them it's your anniversary or birthday if you don't want to pay for a desert.  There don't seem to be any free special occasion deserts at Sassi.  Our meal with tax was $105 before tip.  We dressed up a bit, but there were people that were dressed very casually.  The wait staff was very formal so I would have been uncomfortable dressed very casual.  I recommend you call the restaurant for directions because Yahoo Maps gave us wrong directions.  Don't take Pinnacle Peak road east of Pima road.  Take Happy Valley road east of Pima to Alma School road and turn left.  Go about a mile north on Alma School and Sassi will be on your left at Pinnacle Peak Parkway.  East to spot once there.   I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the service first rate and the ambiance can't be beat.  However, you should be aware that the food may not appeal to those looking for typical Italian or the meat and potato crowd.  That being said, there is a wonderful selection of decadent treats for those willing to try something new."}
{"text":"Granted this could be an unusual, once a year experience, but my girlfriend and I went there for New Year's Eve, and we felt as if we had been held up at gunpoint, and forced to pay for their insanely small portions. Okay, we both have a few food allergist's and gluten. But considering their normal menu had many options, we felt confident it would work out. To our dismay, they had the most limited prix fixe menu I have ever seen in my long life. Basically one starter, one second course, and the choice of three items for the third course. We explained to our insanely friendly waitress (the one who would now pass by our table every three minutes with a nervous smile on her face and ask us how we were doing, until we lived in dread for her next pass by) our food allergies. She seemed taken aback. Twenty minutes later she explained the chef would do something special for us. Special indeed. We had sat down at 9:10pm. Our first glimmer of food on the table came over an hour later. The chef had concocted some very strange food balls as a first course, which she tried to describe as chickpea fritatas, but really looked like something you threw together in your first college apartment. The waitress kept passing by even more often to make sure we were enamored of these \"balls,\" which forced my girlfriend to eat most of them, to get her off our back. She even made me eat one and they were strange tasting to say the least--more like glue balls. As we waited and waited we saw people who had come in after us already getting their desserts. Then finally came the salad, a very normal but very small salad. What made the chef take almost an hour and a half to present us with this extremely average salad? Now, the courses came at us fast and furious. A risotto dish that was the size of something you would put on your toothbrush. Risotto dishes are generally hearty affairs, a peasant like dish. This portion could not feed a grasshopper. Then came the main dishes. To replace the creamy cheesy side dishes on the highly restricted prix fixe, the imaginative chef had come up with white beans, on both main courses. No other vegetables or starch. The portions were yet again fit for tiny mammals, and the food was not hot. When it was time for dessert (at which point I was dreaming of the crackers and almond butter in my hotel room), the creepy stalking waitress informed us that they did not have fruit (our request) because they did not carry fruit in the kitchen, as they only carried things in season. It seems that no fruits are in season at this time of year, a surprise to both of us. She brought us some sorbet which was surprisingly good, but yet again of ant-like proportions. The greatest surprise came however with the bill. As no prices were on the menu, we were subject to rampant speculation as to the price. We feared the worst and were not disappointed--$135 each, plus a 20% tip already included, all totaling close to $400 for this wretchedly mediocre, extremely late and unimaginative prix fixe \"feast.\" The rice crackers in my hotel room never tasted so good. Perhaps it was a once year anomaly, but be forewarned. It should not be called Sassi's but Sucky's."}
{"text":"One of our all time favs.....we love the food - the service is stupendous and the ambience relaxing...Enjoyed yet another relaxing meal there last night after walking out of extremely loud, packed in like cattle and overpriced Mastro's.  The \"Little Ears\" pasta is my fav dish and hubby enjoyed the summer gnocci...delish!  And Salavatore our server was excellent as always!"}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous!   Went recently and did the appetizers at the bar thing and it was great. It was very slow when we were there which was nice- our server had a lot of personality and was really attentive.   ALL the appetizers were all half off and they were delicious, their homemade sausage is awesome and the sliced meats were nice and fresh.  They have a bunch of wines at $7 a glass and they are real pours!   All in all a great experience, really nice atmosphere and they were surprisingly laid back with our 2yo occasionally acting like a maniac. Lots of good food and drinks for cheap... yay!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place! I've been here for dinner and happy hour and both are just fabulous. The bruschetta is my favorite!!!!"}
{"text":"So I got a 50 dollar gift card for an engagement gift at Sassi, so I said I need to try it. The night started out with some drinks and an appetizer in the bar. I usually start of with  glass of Pinot Noir. For some reason they didn't have any by the glass so I was a bit disappointed until I made the decision trying the cantaloupe martini. OH MAN..that was the best martini I have ever had. It was light and smooth and not too sweet. I would definitely go back for the martini. We had the grilled shrimp appetizer which was very good, but there goes our 50 dollar gift certificate towards 2 drinks and an appetizer.  I ended up with a pizza for dinner. I wasn't to impressed with the menu. Everything was very different and if you a plainer eater, then this place is not for you. If I were you, go to the bar, get a drink and have an appetizer!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Sassi and I can say with confidence I will be coming back! The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable and the food was even better. Thanks to my server Zane I tried things I probably wouldn't have tried and his knowledge and attitude is the biggest factor for bringing me back in. All of his suggestions on wine and food were outstanding so if you try out Sassi request Zane!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dining adjacent to the four seasons at Troon. Terrific, affordable wine lost and sch a stunning ambience from a truly beautiful location.   We were just sad we discovered this on our last night! As visiting Italians, we were most impressed."}
{"text":"Waaaaaaaah! And Grrrrrrrrrrr! I'd leave it at that, but I think you need to hear just why I am so pained.   Honey and I decided to go all out for a biggie New Year's dinner extravaganza. It had been a while since we got all gussied and spent the big bucks. We were due for some eye-rolling, table-thomping deliciousness.   Perusing the short list of our local faves, we both spied the prix-fixe at Sassi and did a little dance. Limited menus at a swank venue usually equate to exceptional dishes, well worth the limitedness of it all. We wanted them to BRING IT. We deserved it!  We arrived just a few minutes late (even got a car/driver so as to be sated AND safe), and were immediately seated. The restaurant was not crowded, we liked our table and saddled up. As is always the case, a pre-dinner cocktail was ordered while perusing the menu. A few minutes later our martinis arrived, poured at the table and we were left to make our New Year's toast. Enter click glasses, raising to lips........screeeeech! \"Excuse me, miss? Sorry, you were given the wrong drink.\" No big deal. It happens.  We ordered our courses with delight and within minutes the appetizer course appeared. This was a trio of selected appetizers, all tasty and complementary. Our empty plates were quickly whisked away, along with our silverware, and whallah, a second plate of the same appetizers appeared. Er, um, we just had this course. No big deal. It happens.   Minutes go by and here comes the appropriate second course. The plates were delivered and we all-to-late realized our silverware was not replaced. A few minutes of trying to discreetly flag someone down and then on to the eating. Salmon - yum, Sausage, pretty yum. Neither as noteworthy as expected, but so far so good.   Next was the highly anticipated lobster gnocchi course. We didn't bother to order two different entrees, we both wanted this to ourselves. Oooooh here it comes! \"Be careful these plates are hot.\" Oh. Wait. This is wrong. These are the selections for the next course. WHERE IS MY LOBSTER GNOCCHI?   Hot plates removed. Hmmmm. Starting to waver between angry and sad. Lobster Gnocchi arrives. Nothing a little lobster can't fix, right?   Well, wrong. Overcooked, tough shards of lobster...but worse, the gnocchi (black) was so overpowered with anise that we could barely get it down. It was one of the most terrible dishes I have had in ages. We were destroyed. And we eat everything.   Oh goodie. Here come the hot plates we were served 10 minutes ago. Now it's been a good 20+ minutes under the warmer. Another warning for \"extremely hot plates\". I'm not sure there is ever a time for appreciating this, save for a cast-iron skillet, or ooey gooey Mexican fare that actually tastes better when all fired up. Well, it cooled a bit considering we had to wait yet again for someone to return with silverware.   My sea bass was fine. It wasn't great. The plate didn't offer much for texture. Rice with sauteed spinach and fish. Mush and mush. Honey's veal was terrible. Tasteless, overcooked discs of mystery meat positioned next to the most horrific attempt at truffled potato gratin (the main reason he ordered the dish) we have ever been served.   By this time we just wanted out. The service, the food, the whole night was throwing us into a funk that was so undeserved for the price and the holiday. Dessert was *shockingly* unspectacular. Two unfinished plates (and I have a mouth full of sweet teeth) were proof that the meal didn't even end well.   So over $400 later, the joke was on us. We were so distraught we decided to call the car early and just go home. In bed by 11:45 instead of ringing in the New Year at the bar at Sassi. Enough said.   A year ago Sassi's butternut squash ravioli haunted me. Now I wake up in cold sweats dreaming I have to endure New Year's Eve all over again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for Valentine's Day and were VERY impressed.  The restaurant's landscape design, interior, exterior and service were nearly flawless. The food was very good. A great amount of detail went into making sure customers were a part of a uniquely elegant and comfortable experience. I HIGHLY recommend it to all in the area, and to those that plan on visiting. It'll be well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, My boyfriend and I ordered the chefs menu and let him pick our dishes. Most of them were pretty good...But I was really unimpressed with a bratwurst as my main course... it didn't taste like anything special and the presentation was ugly.   The accompanying wines were only $40... so the whole dinner was around $150... a bit over priced for what we got, but it is a nice place, good service... but alright food.  The \"rooms\" are gorgeous. We ate in the library. But the Main room, the Garden Terrace and the Kitchen all had their own nice qualities. The wine cellar seemed really nice for a private party."}
{"text":"Best grilled octopus I've ever tasted, soft and tender. The views are amazing, especially at sunset. Also try the limoncello sampler. Mine had kumquat, lemon and mandarin. The $3 bruschetta were lovely. We also had the ricotta, fig goat cheese salad, corn ravioli and gnocchi. Everything was delicious and carefully prepared. Similar to food I had when I was in Italy visiting family. Our waitress was in training while her mentor stood in the shadows ready to jump in at any moment! Both were very knowledgeable and didn't bug us too much. For the two of us it was about $150 with tip. Definitely a great place to celebrate that special occasion."}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner with friends from the four seasons. The hotel must get kick backs because this was about on par. Not worth the prices. A place like Eddie vs it dominicks in the quarter is well worth it. This was just okay. Iam being generous giving 3 stars. If you are in town, only go here if you just need something quick. Don't expect much. Waiter didn't know much about menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service in a very nice atmosphere. Good wine selection. Will definitively return. Hoping it'll be possible to sit outside next time, though. For us Europeans it's mild enough at night to sit outside :)"}
{"text":"Evening out with friends in Scottsdale area and we had dinner reservations here,  On the positive, it's a beautiful venue.....with the charm of an old Italian villa.  Magnificent entrance and was excited to enjoy both the place and dinner.  Little taken aback when our friends could not bring in a bottle of wine in( their policy).  Never had this issue anywhere else and it's not like you are dining at the Michelin star 'French Laundry'  Service was decent at first and the first bottle of wince was uncorked and the appetizers and salads were more than good  But now come the part no one likes.  Our server vanished and the wine glasses sat empty....and no sign of the main course ... and this was for about an hour!!!!!  There's a point when you decide maybe I should just get the check and go elsewhere  Looks like they decided to service a big group and the management decided everyone else could wait  Felt sorry for the young couple next to us as his date was looking she just wanted to flee.....  In the end the steak was over cooked ( asked for medium and got well done) and our server dutifully offered up desert on the house for their tardiness On the plus side our friends kept up the evening with good cheer   I would not go back as service is everything these days .... if you cannot time the kitchen reparation time then you should not take the reservations"}
{"text":"AWESOME. Service, awesome. Drinks, awesome. Food, REALLY awesome. Best place for date night in Scottsdale hands down."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is a 5.  Second time here appetizers are amazing.   Last time we sat in the library this time our table wasn't ready so we went to the garden..  Our server was gone most of the evening she was overwhelmed with how many tables she was given.    The food.   It's ok really average not worth the hype . When someone orders a dish and eats one out of 5 you should realize they were not happy she didn't care...   Maybe just an off might but just was not impressed at all this time."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant...... you can tell that million of dollars have been spent in this place.  unfortunately the same passion for detail wasn't put in the menu. When I went with a group of friends we weren't impressed with the food, i would say it was below average and very pricey.   My last visit was when the original chef was still there, i belive he left to open his own restaurant downtown phoenix, some sort of pasta bar, which i am not very exited about knowing this guy ability."}
{"text":"We went for the Mother's Day brunch.  What a great experience.  Beautiful location and the service was amazing.  It was a different brunch than we were used to, but thats a good thing. Italian beef eggs Benedict, frittatas, and pastas.  Artisan cheeses and cured meats.  Overall though, the service was the best thing we had there.  Everyone was amazing. So thank you Sassi!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience i have ever had in my life. The waiter was extremely rude ,that i had to go address it with the manager. The menu is very limited.meatball appetizer was aweful n salty.over charged for an appetizer we did not recieve and then the waiter argued with me  I will never go back n will not recomend it to the many clients that i see in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I booked a reservation at the Four Seasons and forgot to make a reservation for dinner for New Year's Eve, so all of their tables were booked. We asked the concierge for dinner recommendations, and she recommended Sassi's, so we went ahead and booked after looking online at the menu and positive reviews.   We were not able to get a reservation until 9:00, but when we arrived the restaurant was mostly empty. When we got our menus, we were dismayed to see that it was a prix fixe menu that included items we can't eat because we don't eat gluten and dairy (almost every course included some sort of cream or gluten, such as a butternut squash panna cotta, cheesy polenta, bruschetta, etc, whereas their regular menu did not). So when our waitress came we told her that we don't eat gluten and dairy, and asked if they could leave the cheese off the polenta and maybe just give us a salad instead of the panna cotta. She told us that she wanted our evening to be stellar, and that the chef would specially prepare dishes for us. So we felt extremely lucky that the chef would do that for us, and waited in hungry anticipation while other tables munched on their bread and bruschetta, wondering what would miraculously appear.  A few minutes go by, and the waitress comes by and asks how we're doing. We say fine. A few minutes later, the same ritual. This goes on and on and on. My boyfriend jokes that his mouth hurts from having to smile every five minutes and pretend that we're so happy for getting this special meal made for us, when actually he's starving and feeling sick from the lack of food. More time goes by. The waitress comes by and explains that since the chef is preparing not one but two special dishes for us, our food will come out later than other peoples' food. We smile ingratiatingly and say yes, thank you so much. We continue to stare at other people eating their first course, their second course, their third course. After about an hour and fifteen minutes, we're really sad. Our plastered smiles have turned into grimaces, and the next time the waitress comes by we whine at her. \"Can't you bring us SOMETHING? Some olives, some nuts?\" we plead sadly. She tells us that she is aware of the situation, that she has been watching and seen that no food has been brought to us, and that from this moment on the evening will be turned around for us. It's 10:30 by now, and we have gone through hunger to a state in which we are almost not hungry anymore but just feel sick.   About two minutes later, she appears with a plate of fried balls, telling us with great relish that the chef has prepared these chick pea fritters for us. My boyfriend eyes the fried balls suspiciously. \"Do you trust these?\" he asks anxiously. \"Don't they look breaded?\" \"No, they're fine,\" I insist. So we each took a bite. He practically spit his out. \"Something's not right,\" he said. \"It's not that bad, really,\" I said. I wanted him to eat something because he was so starving, but he was like a cat with a dish of the wrong catfood placed in front of him. To tell the truth, they really were horrible, and plus they were not even hot and I suspect they were leftovers. A few minutes later the waitress passed by and eyed the plate of uneaten fried balls. I ate one more to make it look like we liked them. She passed by several more times, each time surreptitiously sneaking a glance at the plate of neglected balls. I forced myself to eat one more. A few minutes later and we each got a tiny salad consisting of a couple of slices of hard tomato, some hazelnuts and pomegranate seeds, a vinaigrette, and some shaved bits of curly lettuce. Utterly tasteless.  Now my boyfriend started to get angry. \"Why did it take them an hour and a half to come up with this totally unremarkable salad?\" he said with a choke in his voice. He is a salad eater, and gets emotional about bad salads.   After that the dishes came in quick succession: about THREE OUNCES of a decent mushroom risotto, and then the entrees. One was a horrible veal thing which consisted of two slices of a cold, white, chewy, tasteless mystery meat over equally tasteless white beans along with a little chunk of veal cheek stew which was okay but also cold. The other entree was one miniscule and very bland quail which was at least served hot, over the same white beans. We almost could not eat the veal and the beans, and left half the beans although we had so far received only a few ounces of food. For dessert we requested just fruit, but she said they didn't have fruit \"because we only have fruits in season,\" and instead brought us sorbet. We didn't want sugar but the sorbet was decent.   No prices on the menu - then the bill came. Almost $400, with only one glass of wine and a Pellegrino. That was the worst expensive meal we've ever had. The other diners didn't look too happy either. They would have been starving as well, if not for the bread, which they devoured like wild animals."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for our anniversary dinner, this place is top notch all around. Caprese was the best I've ever had and the meatballs were great as well. Service was first class and the ambiance was great. We ordered the salmon and the ny strip, both were very good. Would love to make it back here soon."}
{"text":"Amazing setting .. stupendous views inside and out (I wouldn't mind getting married here!). Service was top-notch; I can say nothing bad about it (the hostess even called me the next day to thank me for coming in!).  The menu was a bit limited (but changes often ... I like that). The portions tended towards the small side, but totally satisfying.   The prices are rather high, so this isn't your typical \"happy hour\" locale. However, for a special occasion and/or special someone, you would be hard-pressed to find a better location."}
{"text":"Amazing meal in a beautiful setting with outstanding service!! A wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"This was my absolute first time at Sassi. What an experience!  From the moment I walked in I was greeted very pleasantly by the hostess and three staff members.   Staff were extremely knowledgeable of the wines as well as the menu items.  After my arrival, the place filled quickly; ranging from couples to eight member parties. Noise was at a minimal.  I began my dining experience by having a glass of Merlot as I admired  the artwork, lighting, furniture, etc. and soaked up my surroundings. I noticed that every occupied table had a bottle of wine on it... except mine.  I was please with the entire experience. I recommend Sassi for special occasions or for those that missing true authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with amazing food and one of the most gorgeous places to eat in the North Scottsdale area. My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here several years ago and it did not disappoint! There are more private dining areas in the restaurant for a more intimate atmosphere, and the patio...stunning. You can't ever go wrong with the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Without a doubt THE worst place to try and rent space from for an event! None of my inquiries were addressed. Facebook-no response! Voicemail-no return call! Email-no response! I left multiple messages. My daughter also tried in vain to get some sort of feedback. Please don't waste your time with these people. Have your event somewhere else. You'll be disappointed right off the bat!!"}
{"text":"It is always re-assuring to have consistent service, wine choices, and especially food at this restaurant.  We only take good friends there to share the experience.  From the greeting at the door to the service from the valet, everything was most enjoyable. Our guests were impressed as well.  The black sea bass was perfectly seasoned and prepared.  Keep it folks."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue and great service, however price DOES NOT reflect the food.  Better high end restaurants nearby for same or half the price."}
{"text":"THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY EVENING!  Yes, this place is a drive, but so beautiful and worth it!  After a terrible time at Cellar 13 & C4 (Cave Creek Wine & Coffee), we wondered what else to do since we were up North.  SO GLAD WE THOUGHT OF SASSI!!  Ron, the bartender was so eloquent and debonair.  It was like he knew us and welcomed us back with open arms.  WHAT a HUGE sigh of RELEIF after being treated so poorly at C4.  WHEW!  The chianti was just right, and the bruschetta was to die for: simple but perfect.  Beef skewers tender & juicy.  Olive bowl was unique and tasty: all different sizes, shapes, and color.    You are certainly treated like a somebody here, that's for sure!  I definatley have to come back more often, it is really worth the gorgeous drive - and the sunset!  W O W !"}
{"text":"Exceptional fare and service, Chef Chris and his staff are detail oriented. and the taste validates same.  Thank you to all the Sassi staff"}
{"text":"If you want to give a \"most improved\" award, I vote for Sassi. Over the years I have had meals that at best were so-so. However, for the past year or so, their food and service has improved immensely. On our last two trips we ate in the bar, and were overjoyed with the food and service. During the summer they had a simple pasta and beans special that was sensational. I hope the chef brings it back as an everyday item. Their calamari is served differently than most restauarant, and that's probably why it looks and tastes so great! It is a beautiful restaurant, and now that the problem with food and service has been corrected, we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"I come here 2 to 3 times a year for special occasions and enjoy it every time.    The braised short rib is amazing.  I lover Chelsea's Kitchen braised short ribs too but Sassi's are even better.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Second time here.   First visit was for a wedding and the filet mignon was excellent.  My second visit was last night .. No filet mignon on menu.  Ordered their chicken thigh dish. Quite possibly the most wretched nasty thing I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"We had family visiting for the holidays and took them to Sassi for dinner.  We ordered a bunch of different dishes and I must say, almost everything was great.    The risotto was a big hit as were the olives, cheese plate (I actually came home and ordered a wheel of the midnight moon cheese it was so good), raviolo, lamb, mussels, scallops, roasted root veggies, short rib and pear butter cake.  The only complaints I heard from the table were about the sea bass (not much flavor) and that the short rib was a little fatty.  My complaints are: The buffalo mozzarella salad did not taste like buffalo mozzarella.  It tasted like a very cold and very firm fresh regular cow's milk mozzarella (and not a very good one at that), the red tomato slices on the plate were rock hard.  The bread basket had a few slices of  Italian bread - good bread but I'd like to see something a little better, some variety would be nice. I'd also like a pepper grinder on the table for the olive oil.  The service was not great - it was slow, the kid was lost at times, the wrong food was dropped off at our table, and we had to get the check early because our server seemed to evaporate as the meal progressed.  I guess I feel this way about Sassi, it's cheap, the ambiance is fantastic, and the food is mostly very good.  I wouldn't take friends that are accustomed to fine dining here but it's a pretty solid spot.  I still say it's more of a 3.5 than a 4."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this restaurant.  The whole place is breathtaking. The details were beautiful.  The food was beyond amazing. Zane our waiter was so informative and suggestive. We were sad to hear they were closing the restaurant May 26th.  Go enjoy a nice meal before they close. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Simply fabulous!  Amazing ambiance and setting, like an Italian villa.  Impeccable service.  And delectable food, and some of it is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Super yummy.  Had the caprese salad which was amazing, meatballs, bruschetta.  All fantastic."}
{"text":"Service was a tad slow and the chef was a little heavy handed with the pepper (I do not like pepper in my food) but all in all it was a most pleasant dining experience. Vibrant Bar Scene, Fit for Foodies, Good for Groups, Great for Outdoor Dining, Neighborhood Gem, Notable Wine List, Romantic, Special Occasion, Scenic View, Hot Spot"}
{"text":"Stunning place, impeccably clean, staff is very attentive.. service was excellent.. food delicious enough to dream about and the beautiful live smooth jazz in the bar area was the perfect ending to our wonderful evening.  We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"To say I expected better is an understatement. Overall, the food is okay at best and the service left much to be desired. I enjoy fine dining occasionally, but I have high expectations for a high cost meal. First, the food. We ordered the mussels, caprese salad, cavalli pasta, the veal and the roasted pork. The mussels were the only thing I actually enjoyed. The caprese salad had soft tomatoes, the pasta seemed under cooked/chewy, my veal was rare, and overall I was disappointed. The service was in line with the food...just okay nothing spectatular. The table next to us had to send their bill back twice, because it was wrong. I don't recommend going here if your looking for a meal that wows, but the resturant and grounds itself is beautiful (that's what got it two stars).  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Sassi is to die for. There are twinkling lights everywhere and you almost feel like you're in a villa in Tuscany. There are multiple rooms: some with fireplaces, some with cozy nooks. The staff was very friendly from the hostesses to our server who went out of his way to make sure that we were pleased with our experience. They also had separate wait staff who cleared the dishes all at once which I thought was a nice touch. I enjoyed the risotto, although I personally would have liked less in the dish than there was (there was too much cheese or onions or something). My boyfriend also loved the lamb chops. The prices were somewhat expensive but not too outrageous because of the quality of the entire experience. Next time we are in Scottsdale, I would love to come to watch the sunset on the mountains."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. How can you not be?  Great ambiance and food! Yes, the food is expensive but worth it. (Your whole evening will, I promise, be much cheaper than a trip to Italy, but you'll feel like you're in another country.)  We treated the dad and sister to a Christmas dinner at Sassi on a Friday night and had impeccable service and a great time sharing \"family style\". All main courses are exquisitely prepared - you have to try the seasonal fish on the menu - and the starters are unique and tasty.  I recommend dinner for special occasions and drinks for when you want to get away to Italy but can only get to Pinnacle Peak and Alma School."}
{"text":"Have had many wonderful meals here, got married here last year and love it so much I'm moving next door next month! : )  I really love this place.  Gorgeous area with stunning views, nothing better \"Tuscan\" decor, and great wine list.  Highly recommended:  the calamari, the gnocci, the filet, and the limoncello martinis.  And everything else.  if you're thinking of getting married here... they do a PERFECT job on your special day.  Getting there, however, can be a little less than perfect.  My experience dealing with the management was stressful, as their communication was spotty which is the last thing you want when planning a wedding.  However, they come through in the end with not a detail overlooked."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner and had a wonderful time. The venue is large and would be perfect for a wedding or a nice party. The style is Tuscan and there are large fireplaces in some dining rooms that are beautiful and help keep you warm.   The menu is well organized by course. The snack course is first and accompanies your cocktail of choice. We tried the roasted nuts and loved them. I had two slices of cucumber goat cheese bruschetta and they were soooo good! I only needed one, though, they were quite large but i ate both!   We are vegetarian and the menu was easy to follow and was accommodating. I had the caprese salad. It was $22 and not worth it. The mozzarella portion was generous but not the best I have had. Also - no balsamic! I thought that was a staple. Apparently not.    The gnocchi was my main course and it was delicious. It made up for the caprese. The sauce tastes fresh and the pasta pillows were soft and perfect.   I had the pear brown butter cake for dessert and it was fabulous! Next time I will substitute vanilla gelato for anise... Black licorice is disgusting.   Our waiter was Todd and he did a great job recommending dishes and explaining which could be made vegetarian for us.   We will be back! Thank you Sassi for a great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Sassi isn't just a meal... it's a culinary event. The atmosphere is incredible, and the food is beyond description!  Plan for 2-3 hours. Any less and you're shorting yourself.   Truly one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to this would be a must so if you want to have a nice anniversary or a proposal or something very special to atmosphere the scenery everything is top-notch unfortunately I have to start off with the mediocre service not sure if the server just didn't want to be at work or that was just me and I kid eating so he thought he wasn't going to tip he has had a nasty attitude overall by the end it was a little better but the start off with not good that's on that run the night it was such a nice night outside start off with the grilled octopus iPad octopus mini places and I would say that's probably one of the best I've ever had seriously Tinder the dressing they put on it was very well-balanced then take away from the dish at all I almost ordered a second one even my son likes it a lot and he is not a fish person I would like weenie and clams that was very good as well not the best I've ever had but still very good everything was cooked great son the gnocchi which he didn't really look like it I tried it it was okay but I didn't realize when we ordered it it was just made out straight or ricotta cheese not potato so I had no firmness to it and the sauces pretty heavy probably when I order that again I have the brown sugar pina cotta it was okay I was expecting a little bit more when it get it again but overall pretty great experience besides a waiter but he got better at the end so I don't know would you go back for sure"}
{"text":"The lounge area on Friday's and Saturday's is the place to be. They have different pianist both nights that give a fun but relaxing environment, great for sipping cocktails and unwinding after a long week. We typically snack on the bruschetta board (DELICIOUS!) but the times we have ordered entrees have been fabulous as well. If you live in the North Scottsdale area and are looking for a beautiful, relaxing and fun place to unwind, look no further!"}
{"text":"WOW. We were in town for the Arabian horse show in Feb. We celebrated my aunts 50th here. What a amazing place. I am not usually a person to try new foods but we ordered a ton of things. The meatballs.. perfect. The wine selection was awesome. I had the lamb... can't say enough about this place. It's a pretty classy place I wouldn't go there if your looking for bar food or a bar experince. The fire place in the middle of the room kept it warm since it was unusually cold there that time of year. I would go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Valentine's Day and upon confirming the reservation they advised that it was a $185 pice fix menu and we could not order off the menus. It is apparent that because they are going out of business that they are gouging the public. We are glad they are closing their doors so that they won't be able cheat customers."}
{"text":"This is literally the most romantic restaurant in Arizona by far BUT I really do wish they could cater more to vegans, that's why the 4 star."}
{"text":"Most amazing dining experience ever. I have nothing bad to say. Every element came together in perfect harmony. Just go!"}
{"text":"I am going to start off this review by saying I may be a little biased, but in my opinion Sassi is the BEST restaurant in Phoenix!  The reason I am biased is my Husband and I got married here 2 years ago after falling in love with this place and then getting engaged here.  With all that said, even if this place wasn't so magical (because of everything it means to me) I would still love it.  We had dinner here this past Saturday and, as usual, the food was amazing.  We the roman meatballs, like usual, and they were fabulous.  We both had pasta dishes after that and again, so good.  Finally to dessert, Sassi hasn't always had the best dessert selections, but this time we went the menu changed a bit.  It was overall paired down to some great selections, but the biggest change was the desserts.  We had the peach cake with cinnamon gelato, and I must say, it was FABULOUS!  I just love Sassi and would recommend it to anyone for a nice romantic dinner out and a taste of true Italy!"}
{"text":"Kevin W. Thank you for your response to my critique last month.  I am glad you have amended your policy so specials are including in the Preferred Drive Ning Card however since I didn't hear from you sooner I already moved the the plans for my daughters wedding next year to a different venue.  Jim Sebbens 602-300-7147"}
{"text":"We had great vegetarian food here. The squash blossoms for appetizers were great. The gnocchi with pesto and tomatoes were great. Great food and good service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an outstanding and wonderful dinner at Sassi's tonight! This was our first visit, and I move in a wheelchair which I found very comfortable in the large and spacious environment. The ambience of it can only be described as inviting and warm!  They grilled octopus on the appetizer list is something you should not pass on. Our waiter also did a balsamic, olive oil plate with parmesan finely grated down middle of plate to dip the wonderful bread in!   Our waiter tonight was one of the best I've ever experienced and walked us through our dining experience. He was not pushing any particular menu item but more helped us create a three course dining experience with wonderful wine. That will have us coming back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Sassi!  We don't frequent it nearly as much these days with our busy lives, but when we do, we always enjoy it. One of us usually gets a special to try something new. Plus the view is just spectacular!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with another couple. Used a \"preferred dining card\". Every restaurant on the card we have been to deducts not the most expensive item, but the next most expensive. They never deduct the least expensive item. Sassi decided that the items my wife and I ordered had to be used for the card - although the card is not specific to who can utilize the card. $6 difference on a $200 bill. Mentioned this to the waitress, she spoke to manager who said this is how they do it. Then they had the audacity to charge all of us 20% gratuity. Why should my friends, whose items were excluded from the bogo offer, be obligated to tip 20%. If I had paid for the entire dinner, shouldn't I have been entitled to not having the \"least\" expensive item removed.   I even went so far as to call the manager on the way home, explaining how I was quite surprised that they would rather lose a customer (I had been there a handful of times) over a $6 differential. Manager was completely unresponsive - surprising that he is actually a manager. Will never return - terrible customer service.  In response to inaccurate reply by manager:  If there are 4 meals ordered at the table, the 2nd price item should be the \"bogo\" item, not the least expensive of the 4 items ordered. You are not following the cards policy. And to quibble and bicker over a $6 differential on a $200 bill shows a complete lack of respect for customers. Look at how many reviews are negative for this restaurant lately. Complete disconnect from customer service."}
{"text":"Getting married at Sassi was one of the best decisions I have ever made! My fiancé and I looked at 10 different venues and fell in love with Sassi the moment we walked in. The atmosphere is inviting, cozy, and elegant! We knew we didn't want a huge wedding and the reception space was the perfect size for 100 people. We had a tight budget and Vicky worked with us to explore a few dates to find which one would work best for our budget. It just so happened that the best date for us happened to be Valentine's Day which is also my fiancé's parent's anniversary. After booking and signing our contract, Vicky took no time to get us all of our \"wedding homework\" and kept in contact with us every step of the way. Our food tasting was unbelievable and I knew our guests were just to love, love, love the food! As the wedding approached, Vicky kept us updated on what was happening and what she needed from us. The day of our rehearsal, Vicky was there early to corral all of our wedding party and was extremely efficient while walking us through the ceremony and reception flow. I was so surprised when we asked to help set up décor and Vicky said they would take care of everything! The day of, we arrived with our hair and make up already done and Vicky made sure we could sneak into the bridal suite and avoid any of the guys seeing us. We got dressed, did our first look, and did pictures of the bridal party while Vicky and the rest of the staff finished setting everything up. Vicky helped keep us on time and made sure that even if things were going wrong, I didn't know about it. As predicted, our guests loved all of the food and the scenery of the venue. We have beautiful shots with the mountains and sunset in the background and loved all of the rooms of the restaurant that we could use for pictures. Our number one goal for our wedding was to have fun and we had the time of our life. I cannot thank Vicky and the Sassi staff enough for making Valentine's Day the best day of our lives!"}
{"text":"I went here for a wedding. Their steak was so good! Beautiful atmosphere! Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the ambiance and setting, 3.5 stars for the food.  So 4 stars.  The setting is unbelievable and incredibly romantic.  Picture nooks and crannies, warm fire places and fire pits, a great patio, waterfalls....its fantastic.  They have heaters outside and will also provide blankets for you if you would like one.  (I declined, its not that cold yet but others were partaking in them!)  We were seated at a table that was under a bright light and while they weren't able to turn the light down they did move us to another table that was much more romantic and intimate.   Our server suggested a great pinot grigio which was a great way to start the meal.  The breads in the bread basket were quite good, including a blueberry nut bread and focaccia with cheese.  We started with the calamari, which was stuffed with salmon, and was quite good.  A new twist on an old favorite.  For our primi we ordered the gnocchi in mushroom ragu which was good, but not the best gnocchi I've ever had.  I do wish they were a little larger but the portion size for a primi course was good.  For our secondi I chose the lamb three ways (chop, shredded, sausage) which was good but not anything that blew me away.  The shredded lamb was the best of the three.  The chop could have been more flavorful and the sausage tasted like generic sausage.  My husband chose the veal which was a little tough.  We did order a side of butternut squash with honey and walnuts which I absolutely loved, but my husband did not.   We finished the meal with tea and coffee (unremarkable) and a pear tart that was large and tasty.  I wish it was drizzled with caramel sauce, that would have really set it off.  All in all the food was good, I wouldn't say incredible and I certainly wouldn't say the best.  It was solid.  After dinner we stopped into the bar on our way out for another drink and the bar area was lovely.  Very cozy and homey.  I would definitely return to the bar for some drinks on a cool evening."}
{"text":"So went here on a Friday night for my pre-birthday a week early as my Dad and Stepmom were in town to celebrate.  Went for a few drinks.  The location is right alongside Pinnacle Peak and if you are able to grab a table outside, amazing sunset viewing.  Inside the bar area is very dark and they had a band setup (well 2 women singing).  Curiously, even though we are in high season, there wasn't many people there.  The place is pretty huge and they host weddings and other private events there, but none this night.    I'd definitely say this is a great spot if you want to impress a date for sure.  Romantic and the decor is off the charts.  It's old school Italian and you feel like you are in a Roman garden on the outside with waterfalls/decor/ambiance is spectacular.  Didn't have any of the food.  They only had like 3-4 types of red wine by the glass which I found annoying.   Overall I'd go back and check it out."}
{"text":"Simply an awesome meal in a romantic environment with knowledgeable and attentive staff. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance - a hidden gem in the north side of Scottsdale, AZ - perfect for weddings!   I prefer lighter meals and the dishes were rather heavy on the cream; thus the one star reduction. We had the pizza di carne for appetizers and a 3-course meal with duck as well as a 5-course seasonal meal. The duck was delicious for those who enjoy duck. The salmon for the 5-course was not its forte but the rest of the dishes were good.   Other than that, excellent service and beautiful design. More a romantic date than a family night out."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. From the food, to the wine, to the service, everything was perfect. I can't recommend Sassi highly enough, especially for special occasions. The summer three course menu is a phenomenal value and the wine list contains some of the best wines I know."}
{"text":"We greatly enjoyed celebrating our anniversary here last night.  The drive and desert landscape to get to Sassi was stunning. We started off sharing the octopus which was amazing (ask your server how the chef gets the octopus so tender; it's a neat trick!) I had the sea scallops with black squid ink pasta - amazing and perfectly portioned! My husband had the veal and we ordered a side of broccoli that was excellent! Thank you (Joseph our server) for a memorable evening Sassi, we will be back soon to see the amazing sunset!"}
{"text":"@quinterogolf Sassi has the most wonderful patio dining.  Enjoy this awesome weather!  Be sure to have the caprese salad.  The mozzarella is the best in town!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience a True Italian restaurant, not Americanized Italian, Sassi is absolutely the place. The pastas are fresh made, the warm olives and prosciutto de Parma are outstanding and the service and ambience are one of a kind. Special occasion or romantic dinner out, this is the place!  Did I mention the amazing views of Phoenix high above the city near Pinnacle Peak mountain? Breathtaking!"}
{"text":"The Proprietor took the time to visit dozens of locations around Southern Italy to come up the rich design of Sacci. As their website states, \"this fine dining experience transports you to the hospitality of an Italian farmhouse, which has flourished into a classic villa in every sense of the word\".  Each room has a uniquely different feel. They include an Italian cucina, an old world library....very masculine with stone fireplace or outside patio overlooking elevated,  panoramic views of the Valley.   I enjoy my meals every time. But I must admit, the service is usually par at best....very disappointing for the caliber of restaurant this is."}
{"text":"A few friends and I have committed to trying a new place once a month or so.  This was our first field trip and it was a worthy destination.    Up in the hills of north-north Scottsdale, Sassi is in the shadow of the Pinnacle Peak mountains.  The property itself is gorgeous and very much feels like a wedding venue (and it apparently is!).    Enormous leather chairs and distinctive rooms give this place a very lodge-y homey feel.    Drinks were fantastic.  If you're a fan of both tart and sweet, you can't go wrong with the limoncello martini.  The table shared a few apps...  the octopus (which I didn't have but am told it was excellent), the caprese salad and the meatballs.    The caprese salad is possibly one of the best I've ever had.  Moist, flavorful mozzarella atop seasoned heirloom tomatoes, basil and fancy pants olive oil - yes, please.    Although not touted as one of their \"specialties,\" my scallops were amazing.  Again, quite possibly some of the best scallops I've ever had. There was a delicate lemon flavor and when combined with the peppery greens, it was an intense and unique flavor combination.    This is a destination meal.  Don't \"stop by\" for quick before a show or other engagement.  Make this your main event.    There was one aspect of evening that was slightly off putting.  Our reservations indicated that we had one dairy-sensitive and one gluten-free person.  The menus were clearly designed to address food allergies and that was wonderful.  However, gregarious and friendly as our server was, he did not have a good grasp on what \"gluten free\" meant.  I think servers have a responsibility to educate themselves (or be educated) about what specific food allergies encompass so that they may make accurate menu suggestions."}
{"text":"Sassi's is a fantastic place for a special occasions.  Of course, if you have a big enough food budget you could go for fun all the time!  The ambiance is top-notch, and the building itself is beautiful.  I would sit outside near sunset in nice weather if possible.  Gorgeous views.  The food, wine, and service is also top-notch.  I've eaten here several times and each time the food blew us away, and the waitstaff is very knowledgable and enjoyable to talk to.  All the plates just seem to be perfect.  Whether we had the small plate of nuts for an appetizer, or a beef or fish main course, or the desert, it all was presented beautifully and was delicious.  This is probably the best restaurant overall that I've been to, and I've been to a lot!"}
{"text":"Food and Drink  1. I recommend skipping dinner and eating in the bar. Spectacular happy hour, all appetizers are  1/2 off, and wine is $7 a glass.  2. Some of my favs: Eggplant Involtini, Prosciutto, Arancini, Fagioli Fritti and the Cured White Adriatic Anchovies are delicious! Caprese salad is worth the $18.  3. This place understands what portion control is. Instead of piling mounds of food on your plate, they drown your taste buds with sensations and flavors that you've never experienced.  4. The best value is a pre fixe meal   Service  1. Better than Ruth's Chris. They will refer to you by your name throughout dinner if you book a reservation.  2. Oops! Drop your napkin or a utensil? Someone will be right there to replace it.  3. Going to the restroom? Come back to your seat to find a newly folded and fresh napkin awaiting you.  4. Ask for Sal--he's a direct import from Italy and is the epitome of customer service.   Atmosphere  1. Do not let the location fool you--yes it's fancy, but also laid back.  2. The facility is said to have cost ~11 million to build, and if you look closely, you will find that no detail was missed.  3. Beautiful indoor seating as well as great city views on the patio. If you are chilly on the patio, they have an armoire full of blankets.  4. Sit in the bar in a leather winged back chair and listen to live music Friday and Saturday.   Misc  1. They used to have this amazing Caprese martini on the menu but have since removed it, however they will make it for you upon request"}
{"text":"I took my father and wife here to cap off a wonderful day. The place is breathtaking and resembles an Italian villa. You truly feel as if you're in a magnificent mansion and not a restaurant. Take some time to walk around and explore the grounds and soak it all in.  The service was impeccable and everything you would expect. The food was equally decadent and expertly crafted. The prices reflect this of course, but I MUST mention that unlike many upscale restaurants, the courses here are actually generous and not just nibble-sized. I would recommend sharing them, which makes it not quite as cost-prohibitive if you're concerned about that. I love food but there's no way I could make it through 4 courses here by myself. Perhaps Don Corleone could, but not me.  This is one of those magical places where you can just have an exquisite meal and feel like royalty while talking in hushed tones with the love of your life, soaking in the splendor of it all and getting lost in the grandeur. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This place is magnificent. Although it may take you a while to get up there, That sort of adds to how majestic the experience is. You are quite literally sitting on a mountain while you dine. Of course, I came here in December when it was chilly but I can only imagine how wonderful it is to sit outside in the nice temperature. The service is incredible, even took us outside and walked us around and showed us the views and offered to take photos (see attached). We had everything. Appetizers, bread and butter, full meal, and dessert. Oh... And of course - cocktails. Everything was divine. It was a little chilly in the restaurant so I couldn't really wear the dress I was looking forward to wearing, so consider that. On the day that we went there there was also a wedding reception right next-door. So keep that in mind ladies ;-)"}
{"text":"Imagine this, Walt Disney meets a Fantastic Italian Chef... Since the animated film might bore adults, they instead decide to make a restaurant. You might think that when you see the enormous restaurant housed in a spacious Italian Villa that is Sassi. (pronounced like saucy)  Now the truth is, do not be fooled into thinking that because the owners decided to invest a fortune in aesthetics, they neglected the reason to have a restaurant... the food.  The food is as close to traditional Italian as many will ever experience.   I will say this, I cannot speak for some of the experiences that others have had, but I have eaten here several times over the past year and I have never been disappointed.  It is not cheap, and not close, (to me at least) but it is good..."}
{"text":"I had the best pasta dish I have ever had in my life here. We started with the warm olives and grilled octopus that our waitress recommended. They were outstanding. The most interesting part about the octopus was the fried lentils (believe it or not) - it was like butter, not rubbery/chewy at all. Our server was so knowledgeable about the not only the food menu , but the wine list. She helped pair each course (the selection of wines by the glass was also something to note!). I had the special - squid ink pasta with urchin butter and fresh truffles. It changed my life. Others had the osso buco and ravioli and they were off the charts. The atmosphere was great , sunrise peak & the sunset... how can you complain?"}
{"text":"We were here when it opened about ten years back and for whatever reason hadn't been back until this week. We mostly had good feelings about the evening. Our waiter was helpful, sometimes a little too helpful since I felt there was an effort to up sell us into extra dishes or more expensive wine.  Also, he was a little loud so at the next table his explanations and commentary drowned out our table talk.  There were less expensive wines on the list. I picked one and it was excellent. Our waiter brought me a taste though urging we consider another. I was familiar with the other so didn't bother. We started with caprese salad which is plenty for a table of four to share. I had the strip steak which included marrow and had a simple vegetable. My wife had pappardelle pasta with pork Ragu. The menu warned her it was spicy but when she asked the waiter he assured her it wasn't. Unfortunately it turned out to be difficult to finish.  The dessert was a budino, a pannacota which was excellent.  It was a good dining experience. Our friends were pleased too which is good since they recommended it."}
{"text":"I love the natural beauty of the restaurants location. Services was excellent and food was great. Small portions but my waistline appreciates that."}
{"text":"Terrible management. General manager will hide in the back from you if you have any complaints. He told his staff to tell us he went home! He was rude, and inconsiderate, and made it very clear he didn't care any more. This is why Sassi is closing down. Not because if their food or decor, but 100% because of their management."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was wonderful sitting on the patio enjoying the great evening weather.   We started with the bruschetta. We decided  to try all three prosciutto arugula, parmigiano; roasted peppers ricotta and the red chile Gorgonzola dates, pancetta and almonds. We shared these as each serve is very ample. The prosciutto was a little piece of heaven on a ciabatta.  This has to be  by far the best prosciutto I have tasted in the US. The first bite was so sublime I was shocked. The smoothness of the taste was amazing. I should have eaten that last as the others were just ordinary by comparison.  I personally found the red chile one rather salty.   For the main we ordered the wood grilled veal chop and Gayle's chicken thighs accompanied by the roasted asparagus     The veal chop was larger than anticipated.  When placed on the table it was huge. I am used to smaller veal chops. Looked like it was on steroids   Given the size I thought it may have been a little dry, but was pleasantly surprised to find it rather moist.   The chicken thighs came out in a ultra hot cast iron pan. The lemon flavoring was tantalizing and not at all over powering. The only criticism I had of this dish was the golden potatoes overwhelmed the chicken. While the potatoes were excellent there were way to many. I had enough to share with my companion and still did not eat all that were presented.   The roasted asparagus was perfectly done. The only down side here was it came well after the mains were presented and we were well into our meal  We did not order dessert as prior to going I had read the menu for the Mothers Day menu and was excited by what I saw. The regular menu did not appeal so we skipped ordering dessert. I would love to try the Mother's Day coconut pie though.   I liked the feel of this establishment. I was impressed with the no phone nonsmoking rules. Love love that.   My suggestion would be to have a designated smoking area for patrons that smoke. When we left we had to walk through a group of people smoking at the arch way entry   They literally did not move we had to walk around them and through the smoke   The service was excellent. We were surprised at the end of our meal with cannoli as an acknowledgment of our anniversary. A very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"The location and view here is amazing.  Make sure you go at sunset.  The food however was average.  My husband and I love great food and do not mind spending $200 or more for a meal.  We spent about $140.00 here and in my opinion, it all tasted like a $60.00 meal.  Upon arriving we opted to sit outside on the patio which was great until I sat down.  The cushion on my seat was soaking wet which no one realized until my butt was a squeegee and soaked up all the water.  They moved us to a different table, but I spent my entire meal with a soaking wet bottom and no one offered anything for the problem other than a different seat.  No discount on the meal, not even a dry towel.  Good thing I wasn't wearing white pants!  I ordered the pork and it was just an unseasoned grilled pork chop. I had potatoes as my side.  They were just small sliced potatoes with some salt on them.  Nothing above average.  My husband had the Swordfish which was good, but not impressive.  The wine we ordere was great and was a suggestion from our waiter. I also had a strawberry martini which was delicious.  We probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful. We were seated promptly. A little slow for initial service but we were enjoying our conversation. Definitely tries to upsell with would you like Pellegrino or Still water (can't remember the brand) and some warm olives ($5). We declined both as 3 of the 4 of us are not olive fans which we mentioned. In reviewing the specials, I asked about the tapenade with the halibut and if it had olives and the waitress said it was eggplant. When it came it did have olives. As we were dining with clients, I didn't want to make a scene so let it pass but both my husband and I had it and neither of us like them. In addition, the halibut was quite dry. Definitely not the best meal. Will probably pass on going back even though I like the setting."}
{"text":"I have eaten twice before at Sassi and was so pleased with the service and food.  It is pricey but a nice treat.  Last night we took a friend for a special dinner and were frankly shocked at the drop in quality.  The green salad was soaked in dressing and almost inedible.  The bread came to the table chilled as if it had just been taken from the refrigerator.  Our pasta had obviously sat waiting for a while before being brought to our table.  The manager, who seems excellent otherwise, actually was the one to bring us our food.  Frankly, felt the quality no longer justifies the price and we won't go back."}
{"text":"I can understand why this restaurant is closing. OK food; not so wonderful service and a major hassle to check out. Good news - you can forget about Sassi"}
{"text":"Super disappointed last time. The bartender was really rude. Then, I Discovered they had put my meal in the same container with my friend's leftovers. Gross on so many levels. My husband called several times and finally talked to a manager. At first, it sounded like we were just out of luck. They invited us back for a complimentary dinner. Hopefully my delight will be restored. This rating would have been lower had I completed it earlier."}
{"text":"I think the building architecture itself is breathtaking. It's a great quite and beautiful place. I go with my family and we love ordering the octopus. The dishes are wonderful and the staff is very friendly. It's very spacious and has a great dinner menu to offer."}
{"text":"This is defiantly the best of the best.  Best patio in PHX/SDL.  It is pricey but well worth the money."}
{"text":"This pace is beautiful and even though my mom's dish was not exactly right (they fixed it quickly) I'm giving it 5 stars. We ended up here because the restaurant we were going to go to was fully committed.   We sat in the bar area and Happy hour made me VERY happy. A bottle of Prosecco and 3 bruschetta for $29. Let me recommend the Peach and sweet and spicy pepper, and the chef was good enough to share his recipe for how he made the peppers.   We both had pasta and it was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce.   The bar tender / waiter was perfect and the other patrons were friendly and engaging as well.   I'll be back in September with my girlfriend for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is GORGEOUS.  The beautiful layout of this place and the different rooms... love it.  Food is awesome.  We had the November 3 course meal with the wine pairing and it was GREAT.  Hubby and I really enjoyed ourselves.  We got to sit out on the patio next to the fire pit... that's the best spot if you ask me.  I was wearing something sleeveless and it was slightly chilly out, but the fire pit and the warmers around kept it perfect.  I did have one of their pomaritas... (pomegranate margarita) and it was EXCELLENT.  The mixture was great... that's one of those drinks that you could keep drinking, and then stand up to leave and fall over. haha  The bathrooms are beautiful. :)  Each stall has it's own sink!  Love it.  What was even cooler was that the server and the hostess even addressed us by name (we had a reservation) and also congratulated us on our marriage and wished my hubby happy birthday. :-)  It was a nice touch.  I also got a call the next day from Sassi to make sure that everything went well.  BTW... before I went here, I was looking thru Yelp for the dress code for Sassi... I did see some go in there in some nice jeans and nice shoes... but no tennis shoes, no tshirts.  I wore a very nice black sleeveless top (that was revealing) with a nice black skirt and heels, and I felt perfectly comfortable."}
{"text":"This venue is absolutely breathtaking. It is an absolute shame that it is closing its doors for good as it will be sorely missed. But hey if you want to live in an awaited living community, that's who is buying it out."}
{"text":"If I could go MINUS I would! The place was deserted (yes it was the off season but...). Waited at the hostess station for ANYONE to show up! I asked a server in the bar twice if she could find someone and all I got was a dirty look. 10 minutes later the hostess slowly walked out of wherever, never apologized except to say she was \"seating\" someone. Considering the 3 other couples had food on the table exactly WHO was she seating?? The server came by and was like a pushy used car salesman who in rapid fire shot off the menu. We had no idea what he said and just read the menu. The food was average at best and the pork chop was bone dry!! The manager did a \"fly by\" of our table quickly intruding himself and then leaving after all of 15 seconds.  By the way, the parking lot is a HUGE safety issue especially for ladies dining alone as there was hardly ANY lighting in the EMPTY lot! Needless to say I will NEVER come back to Sassi and would recommend you stay away also!!"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to agree that Sassi is almost perfect w/regard to atmosphere.  The setting is perfectly romantic.  I also agree that the food does not quite match the setting, but it is good.  It is southern Italian, so expect some seriously heavy flavors and rich dishes...not something that I could eat every day, but then, Sassi is not your everyday restaurant. We celebrated my boyfriend's b-day here last week (thanks to Kristin S) and it really was perfect...we got a table outside, under the stars and next to an open pit fire.  The service was great and the food was really good.  We were overstuffed when we left, but not so much that we couldn't stop for one last cocktail at their cozy bar. I would recommend this place for the atmosphere alone!  So, I agree, 5 stars for setting and 3.5 for food..."}
{"text":"Special night (husband's birthday) - arrived 40 minutes early for reservations expecting to have a pre-dinner cocktail. Resturant wasn't busy, but patio table (pre-requested) wasn't available yet (completely fine, we were early) and the hostess suggested we wait in the bar.   Went to bar for a cocktail and ordered a drink that was featured on their menu with a specific liquor (Mount Gay Rum). However, they didn't have any Mount Gay Rum. This was the birthday celebrator's rum of choice. Disappointing!  Ten minutes after our reservation time, I went to check on our table. They forgot about our reservation and the fact that we were waiting in the bar.they did apologize, however had no explanation as to why that happened and were only minimally apologetic. There was also no one on the patio except one other couple and there were several open tables. Frustrating...and disappointing!  They offered us a $6 appetizer as a \"comp\"...which didn't seem commensurate compensation given that our bill was over $200. In addition, our waiter didn't seem knowledgable about the food offerings and mis-advised us on food portions. I'd order differently based on what I experienced if I ever went again.  The only saving grace from a service perspective was the sommelier who suggested an alternative, equally priced, bottle of wine to the wine we selected because it was drinking better (it was amazing!!).   All the food was amazing!!!  Wish the night wouldn't have been overshadowed by missed expectations from a service perspective. Disappointing for what was to be a special, perfect evening."}
{"text":"I went here for a wedding a few months ago and the food was some of the best \"wedding food\" I've ever had.  The staff was excellent and grounds beautiful so when my anniversary rolled around I knew where I wanted to go.    I made my reservations well in advance and without a hitch.  They called a day or so prior just to confirm which was nice.  My wife and I arrived about 30 mins prior to our reservation to grab a cocktail at the bar.  The bar (and the entire place in general) is very nice and comfortable.  The drinks were good but a bit pricey which was to be expected.  The bar service was very good.  For some reason our server asked if we had reservations for dinner.  I thought she was asking because they were going to transfer our bar tab to our dinner tab to make it a smooth transition.  This was not the case because we were handed a check when we finished our drinks.  It is still a mystery why she asked for the name our reservation was under.  After our drinks we were directed to our table.  We were given a not-so-good table against the wall in a crowded dining room.  It was not ideal but I didn't complain.  We waited there about 10 minutes without bread, water, or acknowledgement by a waiter.  When our waiter finally did arrive we could tell that he was clearly frazzled.  This poor guy had far too many tables to take care of and was like cartoon Speedy Gonzales on cocaine.  The guy would have been awesome if he could have calmed down, but it didn't happen.  I felt like I was in a timeshare presentation.  Before I knew it I was being sold something and didn't really have time to process what was happening.  Luckily there aren't and bad menu selections so I knew whatever I chose would be excellent so I wasn't too worried.  I just wish we could have been more relaxed."}
{"text":"We weren't sure if we should try based on some reviews but so glad that we did. As soon as you step on to the property it was a magical, beautiful property. I had the limoncello martini, very good. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. We shared the 3 types of bruschetta, delicious. My husband had the veal and said it was some of the best he has had, our friend had the flat iron which I tasted and it was awesome! I had the ricotta gnocchi, minus the anchovies, it melted in my mouth, clearly house made. They also served us a beautiful cannoli dessert for our anniversary. Would definitely go again, romantic setting. Not for children. It is pricy."}
{"text":"Nothing beats the romantic Tuscan villa feel at this place.... in Arizona I mean. Go for the views and beauty of nature.  The food is quite good also (Grilled Octopus is TDF), and staff is very attentive and knowledgable.  Been several times, and will def be back again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I needed a place to have our (very small) wedding - just the two of us, two witnesses and the minister. Sassi agreed to let us use their rear patio for our ceremony and charged us no fee whatsoever! Of course the four of us stayed for dinner, and the experience was awesome. The ambience was outstanding, the wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable, and the food could not have been better. It is certainly a great place for any kind of special event!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the best insulata cyprese I ever ate. A wonderful atmosphere made it a romantic setting."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Sassi. Amazing food and a beautiful setting. We had a special occasion and called to make arrangments. Garrett was very patient and accomdoating. When we arrived, he stopped by to make sure everything was to our liking. The chef, Chris, also stopped by to introduce himself, which we really appreciated. The night could not have been any more perfect, thanks to Sassi, especially Garrett and Chris"}
{"text":"Have had a few special occassion dinners here so this place will always hold a meaningful place in my heart. The first time I had headcheese was here, and it was delectable! The first time I enjoyed asparagus was here, and now I cook mine that way all the time! I look forward to the next chance I get to dine here. Always a memorable experience."}
{"text":"I have only been here for large catering type events, but from what I have seen and eaten I like it.  Most event food is bland and textures. The event food here is nearly as good as what one would expect in a made to order dish. The outdoor space offers great views and some shade.   The indoor space is well appointed and is far from the typical folding ball room feel, it feels like the large dining room in your newly rich uncles house.  If you having an event the one issue is the remote location. An uber ride form just about anywhere will cost you far more than you saved from overusing the open bar."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Good service is the only reason there are two stars. Waste of a beautiful space"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian ambience and food, look no further. Sassi is a huge venue with multiple rooms, which can be rented for catered events, and the food and wine were delightful. At night the whole venue is softly lit with candles and fire pits.  The walls are painted soft colors of Tuscany, with ironwork chandeliers and sconces. Highly recommend for a romantic dinner or group gathering."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely. Stone, wood, and leather abound. The lounge had a fire going and a talented man playing the piano and singing. Service in the lounge was less than stellar, we waited nearly 20 minutes for a drink. Service in the dining room was nearly as slow, and infrequent. I found the menu to be rather limited, and my gnocchi was over-cooked to nearly a mashed-potato consistency."}
{"text":"I raised my score based on the nice, respectful response from the owner. His  response is a bit self serving. I don't know anything about the quality or value of wine, since I don't consume intoxicants. I was aghast at the value they put on 18 tiny pieces of chewy boiled pasta. And, the $12 pieces of lettuce.  The value of my meal should bring embarrassment to Mr. Sassi. But,  he got my hard earned money.  Jokes on me."}
{"text":"As I said before the atmosphere here is so breathtaking the rest almost doesn't matter and they also have one of the best patios anywhere for outside dining .  The bread basket is excellent with variety and you have high quality olive oil to use .  We ordered the antipasto again and now I believe my server LAST TIME gave us the wrong one ( the one for four people last time) because this one was much smaller and maybe less variety BUT STILL GOOD and ENOUGH .  Both dinners were cooked to perfection , we had Veal Osso Buco over polenta and very light and delicious Branzino that came with roasted broccoli and a roasted lemon . The broccoli was a whole top that was roasted and had crisp ends but not burnt , sort of nutty tasting it was the very best broccoli I ever had out .   Service was off the charts as good as can be and like last time they called the next day to discuss how they did .  They participate in the preferred restaurants card program and one dinner was free . They did add 20% gratuity because of the preferred card but I had no problem with that since everything was excellent .   Everything really was great I highly recommend ."}
{"text":"I have to give credit to the Owner, Management and Chef of Sassi for responding immediately to my review.  They were \"Johnny on the spot\" with concern about my complaints.  It went as far as a phone call from Stephen-GM & Chef Peter.  We went thru the entire nights menu and they had in depth questions about each course.  I can tell they care about all the little details and look forward to my next visit. Thanks for caring guys!"}
{"text":"Meant much for big events, not a great dinner spot"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so impressed with the whole experience here at Sassi. From the hostess to the most amazing waiter to the delicious dinner, it couldn't have been nicer! We will be back again and again. Beautiful ambiance! The red snapper in parchment was perfect as was the caprese and eggplant appetizer. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"This was easily the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the grounds are beautiful.   We went to celebrate a birthday, none of us had ever been there before and we were excited as this place came highly recommended. We were seated and our table of 4 became 3 at the last minute. The waiter, Tony, came up and asked if we were waiting for anyone else and we informed him we had an unexpected cancellation. He rolled his eyes in disgust (oh no! A lower tip!)  It went downhill from there. He asked if we wanted warm nuts or olives which we said both and he walked away, never even took our drink order. 10 minutes later when he came back around, he finally took our drink order and one member of my party (the birthday girl) asked about the margarita on the menu and the waiter said \"the description is pretty self explanatory, there's nothing I can say.\" Wow, what an attitude for a waiter. After that he suggested we order everything in one go and he will pace us so we ordered a salad and meatballs as antipasti. Other members of my party ordered a spaghetti dish and I the sweet corn ravioli for our first course. For the second course I ordered the New York Strip Steak which was the night's special and the others ordered the pork chop.   One of my party members asked about the spiciness of one of the dishes to which the waiter responded \"spicy is spicy.\" At Applebee's they tell you \"mild,\" or \"hot.\" Not at Sassi's, the waiters are as sassy as the name suggests. We also informed the waiter that we would be ordering wine with our main entree.   Antipasti and the first course came, no one was impressed. The food was okay, but just okay.   The main course came out and my steak was awful. It had absolutely no flavor and was so tough I had to just down the half chewed chunk with some water to get it out of my mouth. I returned the dish to which the waiter said \"what's wrong with it?\" in a very dissatisfied tone. Nonetheless I ordered the pork shop instead and it came out in a somewhat timely manner, not by the manager, but by the bus boy.   We still have no ordered our wine at this point and had to remind the waiter we still wanted it. We ordered our wine after half the entree's have been eaten. The manager finally came around to approach me about the steak and I told him the reason and that I understand mistakes happen and not everything can be made perfectly every time.   We finished our food, paid, and left. As we left there was no host or hostess to say goodbye to anyone, or hold the door open for us as we left. The front was absolutely deserted. Not only that, but at no point in time, did anyone wish the birthday girl a happy birthday even though it was known.  The manager called the next day and after the other guest in my party ripped them a new one over the phone, she was informed the general manager would be calling her. A week later and we are still waiting for that phone call.   Bottom line is that the waiter had a TERRIBLE attitude and should not be serving people if he can't handle people. The food was just okay, and the prices do no justify the food that you actually get. They set the bar incredibly high and failed miserably. You are guaranteed to get better service at Chili's than at Sassi's and for 1/10th of the price."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful!!  When you first arrive you can tell it is classy. The buildings are gorgeous and have beautiful architecture. Nice front garden area. Looks like they hold private events there like wedding receptions.  Once we entered and were sat, the service was top-notch. Very great with recommendations and the food came out fast.  We got meatballs as an appetizer and I wish we had gotten 2-3 ore dishes of it! Very very good way to start.  The rest of the meal was good but all I kept thinking of was the meatballs.  Overall, this place was great. Expect to pay more but it is worth it for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Just back from an incredibly disappointing meal at Sassi. We had read so many positive reviews that we were really excited for fine Italian dining reminiscent of Italy  The meal started off with a pathetic basket of cold, soggy focacia, crackers and bread that looked like it was from Safeway. Salads were bland, antipasto for two was a pretentious disappointment as was the Bolognese (try (cafe Bink), dry pork chop, boring deserts and high prices.  While the restaurant itself was lovely it could not compensate for the truly disappointing food. If you want great homemade pasta , breads, salad's, entrees and wine at half the price try Nicks in the AJ's shopping center at Pima and Pinnacle Peak Rd's."}
{"text":"Really impressed with the Scottsdale dining scene and Sassi was another solid contributor. First off the location is beautiful. It looked like an Italian villa and it seemed the perfect location for a wedding or special event as they have many rooms on this property to host. Our dining room was very nice and we had impeccable service. The menu was traditional Italian food with options for cheese, salami, antipasti, fish, pasta or meats. Very nice selections that made us take our time to formulate a proper feast. They also had an impressive chef's tasting menu at a reasonable price that was very tempting as well. They also let me order my main off of that which is pretty cool.   We started with the pizza margarita and their arugula salad. Both were very tasty and the ingredients were top notch and really popped with flavor.   For our mains I had the spinach papperadelle with pork ragu and my wife had the ahi tuna. The pasta was an enormous portion and it was fantastic. My wife loved the fish as well.   This meal was great and they have 25% off bottles of wine through September, which is a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. Mostly good food. Eh on the service. Caprese and scallops vet excellent. Carbonara was good. Mussels, not so much. Don't clear the table I'd someone at it is still eating. And someone needs to tell them lemoncello shouldn't double as paint thinner. I can check it off the list as having been."}
{"text":"This is a review that I almost don't want to write. Sassi is a beautiful place, and we had such hopeful expectations for it. But for our party of twelve, on a \"Restaurant Week\" Saturday evening, Sassi was a  disappointment  and we are all in agreement. We arrived at 7:30 and the place was nearly empty. That in itself is ominous on a Saturday night. We are brought to an empty room with a long large table and ask for a round table. Hey, we are all friends and want to be in on the conversation. The answer is no. Simply no. You will have to eat here. The room is very warm, can it be cooled down a bit? It never got cooler.  We are seated and yelling across the table in order to converse with one another and then something very weird happens. There is a woman attempting to sing into a microphone, somewhere, and it is blasting out of speakers above our heads. No music mind you. Just this loud, over modulated voice blaring from the speakers. Make it stop. Please make it stop. Our first two requests were ignored but when my wife told the waitress that she would not order food until it stopped, the manager finally put an end to our torture and assured us that it would not happen again.   There is a special wine list with a $29 section and a more expensive list. At the truly excellent Becco, in the Manhatten Theatre District, they have something similar. But there, the wait staff know the selections, and can help you narrow down the choices. No such luck at Sassi. The waitress knows nothing about anything. OK. Fine. I'll go with the Nero D'Avola. I  assume it will be a safe choice. Of course, I find out much later that it is out of stock. They allegedly have a wine steward, but he never shows, so I make a random pick.   You all know the drill for restaurant week. Fixed price, three courses, three selections in each category. The appetizers arrive and are served randomly to the twelve of us who proceed to play musical appetizers until everything is settled. The food is good but not great. My eggplant is especially good as is the salad and the bruschetta.   For the main course I had a seafood combination, served cioppino. It was a little nondescript but the seafood was prepared well and the portion was generous. Those having the braised short ribs, commended the texture but not the taste. One person ordered fettuccine which came out very, very late from the kitchen and I'm told, was awful.  The cold and soggy focaccia, brought to the table in generous amounts, was still around at the end of the meal when I would have liked to dip a little in the  cioppino. This was not to be. Even though I asked the waitress not to take my plate away, when I turned my head  during conversation, it was whisked  away.   Why? Why induce new, potential regulars to your restaurant and then treat them so apathetically?  Could the built in gratuity be the culprit? Is this a once fine restaurant now on its last legs and ready to close? Who knows? Who cares? There is a bunch of us who made our first trip to Sassi, our last one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here the other night for dinner and we'll definitely be back.  Not only was the food amazing, our waiter was wonderful. He paid attention to small details and even conversed with my boyfriend in Italian making it feel more like home. Next, time I hope we can sit on the patio at sunset to enjoy the view."}
{"text":"I went to one of the most romantic, delicious dinners in the Valley ever at Sassi in north Scottsdale. The restaurant is a replica of a Tuscan villa, and though I've never been to Italy, the relaxed atmosphere during the multi-course meal reminded me of places I've been in Marid.  The huge space has several fire place-filled dining rooms, and there's also a gorgeous, gigantic patio which overlooks Pinnacle Peak. It's no wonder it's a hot spot for wedding rehearsal dinners, and the venue even hosts weddings, too.  Besides the magnificent meal, I loved Sassi for its excellent service. I never felt rushed, the servers and front-of-house staff were knowledgable and respectful and the atmosphere was ultra-classy.  I'm sure it's also spectacular to eat there at sunset with a view of the mountains."}
{"text":"Enjoyed HH here . I generally go to a HH to get a feel of a restaurant that i want to try.  Moscato and Steak skewers for me ( loved it )  Sangria and Bruschetta  for him (i tasted and no complaints) . Service was great. Beautiful place .  We will be having dinner here, shortly And attending the Mondavi tasting at the end of the month.   Update: Mondavi tasting is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Amazing place for views and special occasions!  Overlooks pinnacle peak and we went for apps and drinks sitting on balcony.  Get here before they close in 2018 as the property has been sold!"}
{"text":"It breaks my heart that Sassi is closing just as we discovered it.  And I understand they are going to tear down the beautiful building to construct an assisted living facility. That whole area is being ruined.  Nonetheless, absolutely delicious meal at Sassi to celebrate my birthday.  We started with the Caprese Salad---mundane, but extraordinary due to the Buffalo Mozzarella imported from Italy.  So rich and unctuous---oh!  And also the Wood-Grilled Octopus because it was so highly touted.  It was super-chewy and tasted of nothing but char and I would not order again.  With two Antipasti courses, we skipped the Primi and went straight to Secondi.  I had the Branzino and it was perfectly cooked, beautifully accompanied and just a wonderful birthday meal.  DH got the Waygu Flat Iron Steak and had to return it.  Cooked precisely to medium rare, it was unappetizingly chewy and not a quality piece of meat.  The server took it off the bill with a gracious smile and DH just made a meal of his sides and bites of my fish.  It was okay.  We finished with this incredible dessert---all I can remember is lots and lots of rich chocolate!  Service impeccable and we enjoyed the dining room itself.  Just a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! We went for our anniversary and they made sure it was very special. The ambiance of the restaurant is romantic and has beautiful views. Lovely bar to relax in prior to our reservation. The food was wonderful! The bruschetta was delicious. Excellent house made pasta. Service was exceptional. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This beautiful dining and entertaining establishment is not only exceptional from a culinary perspective but the architecture and design is gorgeous!  Small rooms divide the space creating an intimate dining atmosphere. The spaces are graced with lovely furnishings and decor.   Chef Chris prepared tasty gnocchi, perfect salmon and house made sausages that were packed with flavor. If the old adage \"cooking is all in the ingredients\" then by all means that supports the good food to be had here. The owner told us that local, seasonal food properly grown and caught is of utmost importance to their menu planning.  The grounds and gardens are a perfect venue for a special event. We look forward to our next visit here in Scotsdale and dining here once again."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars for an awe-inspiring location and absolutely gorgeous venue I would. The 35 minute drive from Phoenix to Pinnacle Peak transports you from the city to an old-world Italian villa 10,000 miles away.  Upon arrival you are greeted by a stone courtyard with a trickling fountain smack dab in the middle.beyond the fountain you make your way down the walkway and enter through a large wooden door. Beside an inviting bar and lounge are several rooms lit by soft candle light in which you can enjoy your meal.  I started with grilled octopus which was delicious. I followed this by splitting the pasta with sausage and peppers. For my main I enjoyed a New York steak. This was accompanied by a bottle of chianti.  The food, while great, was a little underwhelming (except the octopus which was great) My New York was coated with a flavorful rub but the rub actually overpowered the flavor of the meat which was disappointing. My steak was also a little more fatty than I am accustomed to in a New York. However the meat was VERY moist and rich so I understand how the marbling is important if this is how you enjoy your meat. However it was a little too rich and fatty for me.  Also if you go with an appetizer and a first course you may find yourself too full for your main which is what happened to me. So the meal overall did not stack up to the atmosphere.  This would not stop me from coming back again however or for recommending it for a special occasion, There are lots of items on the menu so I would be eager to come back again and see what else I can enjoy. The menu is very thoughtfully prepared and the service is top notch so I'm bound to love something there I'm sure."}
{"text":"We went here on recommendation for our anniversary dinner.  We had asked for a table with a view, but it was dark anyway and we were seated inside.  We ordered drinks and the Insalata Caprese.  After eating our appetizer we put in our dinner orders.  It was very relaxed and not rushed at all.  My husband had the Osso Buca while I enjoyed the Linguine with Clams.  The food was delicious.  We shared the cookies and biscotti for dessert.  They were ok...nothing to write home about...but the salad and main dishes were very tasty.  A manager came around and talked to each table around us, but not us.  This was a little disappointing.  We didn't have any complaints, but it would have been nice to have been asked."}
{"text":"Totally average food and wait staff - unless you are going for a wedding which is most of their business not worth your time and money!"}
{"text":"I do not have the ability to write a review that could describe how great Sassi is, but here we go.  The restaurant is basically a multimillion dollar villa perched high on the Scottsdale desert.  The wait staff is amazing, the manager is phenomenal and the food is like nothing I have had before.  On several occasions the staff has gone above and beyond to \"wow\" us and they update the menu seasonally to keep it fresh.  The ambiance is very classy and the waiter Sal with his fresh off the boat, Italian accent is awesome.  You could take a woman on a date here but I warn you, if this is how you are going to set the bar for dining experiences...  there is nowhere but down from Sassi.  All of the food is superb but I highly recommend the following: Sicilian style Eggplant Involtini  Orecchiette con Salsiccia aka little ears pasta Buffalo Mozzarella Caprese  I love eggplant dishes but the Eggplant Involtini is amazing.  The thinly sliced eggplants are rolled and stuffed with fresh mozzarella and baked in a tiny cast iron skillet.  The little ears pasta are so chewy and fresh, served in a delicate sauce.  The Buffalo Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes bring a tear to my eyes they are so enjoyable.   Aside from the dining experience, the picturesque views would be perfect for reception dinners or any other memorable experience.  i can't say enough praise for Sassi or the staff.  If I ever meet the owners I will hug and thank them generously."}
{"text":"We visited Sassi to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary.  We started off ordering the Capressi, Buffalo Mozzarella flown in from Italy accompanied by heirloom tomatoes.  We were so impressed with this dish, we decided to order the Octopus which was highly recommended by our waitress Courtney.  The instant this dish arrived to our table, the aroma was captivating.  The octopus was first poached then finished over a wood fired grill to leave the meat tender yet full of flavor.   The octopus was no less than perfection, something you will not soon forget.  The atmosphere was cozy yet elegant, the perfect setting to celebrate a special occasion or just to experience fine dining at it's best.  We had the distinct pleasure of meeting Chef Christopher, sharing similar interests in exploring food as well as wild game.  The staff, the atmosphere, and our food exceeded our expectations.  This restaurant left nothing to be desired.  Well done Sassi, we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"My husband picked Sassi's for his recent birthday dinner.  He has raved about the restaurant but I had never been.  We went with another couple to celebrate.    The cheese sticks that come in the bread basket were good but when my husband asked for more he was told they ran out  (at 7:30 on a Saturday night!) so he was disappointed.      I started with the Caprese Salad.   I asked about the heirloom tomatoes before ordering since I was concerned about the quality in December.   The waiter assured me they were very good and he was right!  Excellent tomatoes and the cheese was also good.  My main course was the Branzino which was good and my husband really enjoyed the Pappardelle.    Dessert was some type of apple or pear cake which I really enjoyed.    Our friends also enjoyed their meals (Grouper and Pappardelle)."}
{"text":"My daughter got married two weeks ago and it was absolutely beautiful! The service, food, the help, and overall quality of the venue was outstanding! Congrats to Vicky and staff for doing an amazing job and making it an easy and memorable wedding experience. We are looking forward to dining here again soon!  Sassi is a gorgeous place to have a wedding and/or host other family gatherings!  A big thank you to all!"}
{"text":"This place really is beautiful.  I can see why people would want to have wedding receptions here.  There are many spaces with great potential for photographs.  We happened to be in the area for the weekend so we decided to give Sassi a try.  We sat outside on the patio with a great view of the setting sun.  The temperature was around 60 degrees with a slight breeze, but there were heat lamps everywhere so my wife and I both felt warm throughout dinner.  We ordered the grilled octopus, Sassi meatballs, ricotta gnocchi, veal chop, and sea scallops.  The octopus was very tender and grilled perfectly.  The Sassi meatballs were moist and delicious.  The ricotta gnocchi was a bit tough (maybe that's the way they're supposed to be), but they were not as flavorful as the appetizers.  The veal chop had a great grilled flavor but the meat itself didn't taste like much.  It was supposed to be medium-rare, but most of it was more like medium-well until I got close to the bone, then it quickly became rare.  I guess that's what happens when you cook bone-in meat.  The scallops were wonderful, cooked just right.  I rarely have scallops at upscale restaurants that aren't cooked correctly.  I liked the arugula salad that comes with the scallops, my wife not so much so that part's a wash.  Food-wise it was hit and miss, but decor and view are unbeatable.  Service was friendly also which is important to us.  I don't live in the area so I probably won't get many chances to come back, but if I do, I would like to come back earlier in the day and get more pictures here.  It is on the expensive side so I would recommend this place for special occasions."}
{"text":"This is a very poorly run place. Go anywherr but here... High prices,average food poorservice"}
{"text":"We went to a wedding open house @ Sassi and we were both very impressed..and quite frankly sold that this is where we wanted to have our wedding.  I met the wedding planner, Bernadette and her assistant and they said they would give me an estimate within the next couple of days.  They did send me an initial estimate in a timely manner HOWEVER it was for the wrong time of year and for the wrong amount of people.  I emailed her back that night thanking her for the estimate but to please send a revised estimate for the correct date and amount of people.  Fast forward to a week later, I get a one line response from Bernadette's ipone stating \"the price would be the same\"..ok maybe for the different date, but I highly doubt the price would be the same for 25 additional people.  So I again, asked her for a revised estimate for 25 additional people...two weeks later...still no response.  I've now shifted gears and am working with a wedding planner in Paris..who responds to my emails either that day or the next day.  I'm baffled that someone from across the world delivers better customer service then a place a couple miles away.  Considering this is a tens of thousands of dollar purchase.. I guess Sassi doesn't want our business. :-/"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find the gem of an authentic Italian restaurant way up the the hills of north East Scottsdale.  I brought my family of 5 on a spring break Tuesday night with a last minute reservation.  We were seated beneath the stars on an outdoor patio at the base of pinnacle peak.  Gorgeous evening!  Appetizers were buffalo mozzarella imported from italy and grilled octopus. The mozzarella was a little gamy and it seemed old, not creamy. The octopus however, was top notch!  Next came the pasta course which I found tremendous, gnocchi was the stand out.  The main course of whole roasted, stuffed Branzini was sublime.   The real perk at this place is the wine list which had an incredible selection of unique italian varietals with only minimal mark up."}
{"text":"Hands down this place is the bomb!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  It's that good."}
{"text":"Incredible Restaurant! We recently bought a home in the area and decided to try Sassi for my birthday. As we approached the restaurant the lights were twinkling, the fountain flowing and the hostess greeted us with a warm smile. The ambience is beautiful. We felt like we were back in italy dining at an Italian Villa. It is one of the few restaurants that took the time in creating perfect lighting. It's rooms are dimly light, but have down lights over each plate so you can read the menu and enjoy the visual of the food. Ambience, service and food were all 5 stars. I can't say enough wonderful things about Sassi!"}
{"text":"We were married at Sassi in 2006 and everything was spectacular! Returned last night to  celebrate our anniversary and what can I say -amazing! They had beautiful flowers on our table on the patio for us, service was perfection (thanks Toni you were fabulous!) The food was amazing! The wine so good I had to buy a bottle to bring home and the desert-delicious! Thank you Toni, Nicole (for taking pictures) and to the chef. Sassi will always hold a special in place in my heart!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were married at Sassi one year ago today, and had the most amazing dinner there tonight to celebrate.   The food and service were amazing. Tom and Richie were over the top with their service. We brought our three children ages 3, 6, and 8 with us and they somehow were able to keep them happy through a 2 hour dinner!  The kids had as much fun as we did and we greatly appreciated their help. Richie was the man with the bottomless chocolate milks and Tom was spot on with his food recommendations and wine pairings.   We loved our experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in AZ.  The location, the view, the wonderful staff and the fantastic food all combine for a delightful experience."}
{"text":"With Wade Moises at the helm, there was no better real, high-end Italian cuisine in the Valley. Marcellino's is quite good as well, but not necessarily better. Inventive, fresh and authentic. The setting is a bit over-the-top-North Scottsdale, but beautifully executed. Eating on the patio there can be heavenly. The long drive home, less so. That drive being further frustrated by the consistently best martinis in the Valley. You have to watch yourself, cuz they go down smooth.  But with Wade leaving, I fear for the future of Sassi. This is a potential blessing, in that his new place will be in downtown Phoenix, leaving Sassi to find a competent replacement (who won't have the former exec in his backyard). And it means Wade's amazing handmade pastas will be closer to my belly.  But it remains to be seen if they can find the right replacement. Tall order to fill. Best of luck, Sassi!"}
{"text":"Best romantic place for dinner ..Location Location  and views are to die for. Would recommend highly"}
{"text":"Got violently ill from food poisoning, ate the sausage orchiette, ended up in the ER. Called the restaurant and they apologized."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday, Nov. 1st. We were celebrating a special anniversary staying at the Four Seasons next door. My boyfriend suggested we go Sassi, told me it was a nice location. We looked up menu beforehand and thought it looked good and were sure of what we wanted to order. We get there and decide we want their special, Lobter Ravioli, first thing our lady server says to us is that they are out of the Lobster Ravioli!!! First bad impression down!! That was a bummer! Then we both know we want meat, so we go ahead and order appetizers and our main course RIBEYE FOR TWO, and guess what??!!!! Our server comes back to tell us they are OUT of the ribeye!! NO WAY!!! At a large restaurant like this? On a busy Halloween weekend? OUT OF THEIR MAIN DISHES??? So from there our special night was spoiled, too bad we were so happy with the setting and look of restaurant to then end up spoiling it with lack of service from it. Our server was sorry, but didn't really seem to care too much we were not happy, she did not seem to tell manager of our bad experience. Our Octopus was very good I can say that, our clams with sausage were good too, and the Pork chop and shortrib pasta was not that great, maybe it was that we were already in a different mood, upset. We ordered regular coffee, and were thinking of ordering dessert, when they come back, to tell us \"SORRY BUT THERE IS NO MORE COFFEE, ALL OF IT HAS BEEN DUMPED OUT ALREADY!!!\" NO WAY!!!! The server, knowing that we had already been urned down with so much, asked the other server to please make another pot.  We drank coffee and decided to not even order dessert. WE JUST WANTED TO LEAVE THIS PLACE WHICH CAUSED US SO MUCH DISSAPOINTMENT. And again, not that we were expecting anything, but like I said, server said she was sorry but did not really seem to want to do anything about the problems, usually manager comes over to apologize and offer something to keep us happy. Not in this case! I think the server didn't even let manager know we were so disappointed and upset! Won't recommend in terms of service ever! Feeling so sorry and upset to have had to spend our special night that way. :'("}
{"text":"We got married at Sassi in November 2012 and it was the best experience!  The staff was very helpful and knew exactly what they were doing.  The setting of this restauant/event center is as beautiful as it gets....overlooking the entire city and set in the perfect desert landscape snuggled up to Pinnacle Peak.  This is the best setting for a romantic night or entertaining friends/family.  - - And the food is absolutely to die for!  We still get complements on the wedding dinner!  Thanks Sassi!!!"}
{"text":"Great food - problem with check handled poorly by manager - very poor customer service' - seemed indifferent to whether our group was satisfied. Generally a bad experience."}
{"text":"Went to Sassi for our anniversary and it did not disappoint.  The ambiance and decor are very romantic.   We were promptly seated indoors facing the open patio.  A cool breeze rolled in keeping us comfortable.  Our server, Krista, was exceptional.  She took time to explain the menu and provide recommendations.  She was very attentive and polite, but did not hover.  Needless to say, she made some excellent recommendations.  We sat for several hours as the courses arrived and enjoyed the relaxed pace and our time together as the food arrived.  It was all excellent - but the Duck Liver Budino, Orecchiette, and the Pork Chop Milanese were most memorable.  Make sure to save room for the Apple Cake with Salted Caramel Gelato.  All in all a perfect dining experience.  We'll be sure to be back soon."}
{"text":"If you want a truly romantic evening out with a loved one this is the place to be. I'm in the wedding business and initially first went there to do a wedding and I was blown away at how beautiful it is inside and out. I knew that the next time my husband and I went out for a romantic meal this was going to be the place to go. We went and it exceeded my expectations. My advice is to trust the chef and have the 5 course tasting menu and also spend the extra and get the wine pairings. The only thing to complain about was the dessert was not impressive. They need a pastry chef."}
{"text":"Very romantic, quiet locale for a nice date night.  Great service and tasty food"}
{"text":"Last night went to Sassi to take advantage of the start of Arizona Restaurant Week. This was my second visit to Sassi. Had been there once before a few years ago. The menu has changed from several years ago, for the better. We had four in our party and started off with the Antipasti for four. They offer it for two or four people. Excellent quality of meats, cheeses, roasted vegetables, olives, caponata, broccoli rabe, beans. They offered $29.00 bottles of wine to go with the $29.00 restaurant week specials. We had two bottles of the Cabernet/Sangiovese blend #501 on the menu. Excellent.  Each of the members in our party ordered restaurant week specials. Roasted butternut squash soup was phenomenal. Sole and Pork Chop were outstanding. Chocolate dessert was the best choice from the selection. The restaurant is a multimillion dollar Tuscan villa set in the desert of North Scottsdale. Just a beautiful place and experience all the way around. Service was superb."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Thur evening at the bar. Dead...except for Mexico vs. Nederland's soccer on TV. The place is beautiful, but the energy is not there. Plus mgmt has to correct the sewer smell as u enter the court yard."}
{"text":"Combine one of the world's nicest physical eating establishments (both natural surroundings as well as the $10+ mil restaurant itself), arguably some of the best gourmet Italian food West of the Atlantic, and impeccable service and you have yourself a winner.  Prices aren't cheap but in my opinion it's a deal considering what this package offers.  Think I'm exaggerating?  Check it out and let the truth be told!"}
{"text":"Poor service, ok management and mediocre food. The only thing this has going for it is the view.  Seated late, seating preferences not honored, slow service, and a wait staff that didn't understand the reason why the table next to us, a few bottles of wine in, was being a bit loud.  I can go on and on about why this wasn't a good experience but I don't want to waste my time or yours, I suggest you avoid this place - it's not worth it.  My advice, go to Tonto."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Sassi and it was as picturesque as ever. The setting is spectacular. Sadly you cannot give a restaurant review based solely on atmosphere. The appetizers were very tasty. Caprese, meat and cheese plate, warm olives (best thing ever!) and one more but I can't think of what it was. For dinner we had carbonara, halibut, short rib ragu, and something else. The pasta was ok, not what I was hoping for but it was still ok. The short rib was very good. The halibut was terrible. Cooked in a bag with cauliflower and extreme amounts of lemon I heard its one of their specialties but none of our group was able to eat it. The dessert was ok. The service was professional."}
{"text":"What an amazing venue! Recently went for a friends wedding and the waitstaff was amazing especially Marta! The food was good and they helped with every little thing during the ceremony and the reception! It's a beautiful location and very well taken care of!"}
{"text":"In all fairness, I have dined here in the past and my experience has been positive, which is why I suggested this restaurant for dinner on Saturday evening.  I am a vegan and Sassi has always been very accommodating given my dietary preferences.  I called and made a reservation for 7:30, requesting outdoor seating. She receptionist told me that if we arrived at 7 we could be on a waiting list for an outside table and would probably get it. She informed me that they were extremely busy that night for dinner.  We arrived at 6:50. I had my little service dog with me complete with vest. On the way in we saw a couple with a standard poodle with a service dog vest on so we anticipated no problems. At the desk we were told that dogs were not allowed and we would have to leave or put him in the car. The man at the desk was rude and dismissive.  Mind you, I have taken this dog into the fanciest restaurants in Santa Barbara California with no questions asked. He behaves perfectly in these situations.  We decided to put the dog in the car.  When we returned, we were seated in an indoor table although there clearly 75% of the tables were unoccupied. We were instructed by the waitress that we should order an appetizer first, which we could \"snack on while we sipped our wine\". We ordered wine and olives.  We got our wine but no olives. We did get bread, which was delicious. We ordered 2 courses and I explained that I am vegan and I wanted no cheese. I ordered the melon. I got not melon but a cucumber plate which I decided to accept so as not to cause a delay. It was very good but I suspect the horseradish sauce on the side had dairy, which I have specifically instructed the waitress not to give me.  The olives finally came at that point  My friend got the main dish he requested, but mine came with cheese. The waitress took it back and it took a good 20 minutes to bring my cheeseless main dish out. By this time I had eaten enough of my friends meal that I was no longer hungry.  We asked that it be boxed.  I ordered tea and my friend ordered a latte. He got plain coffee. He sent it back and finally got his latte. The bill was $125. Sassi has long been on my favorites list of special restaurants, but no longer."}
{"text":"John was our host. We told him our name and that we had a reservation. Instead of being seated in a windowed room with all of the other dining guests, we were escorted to a room off of the kitchen to sit by ourselves. When my husband asked if we could be seated in another room, John stated that the room would \"fill up\". I then walked out into the hallway and told the wait staff that we wanted another table. John returned upon which we then told him it was our anniversary. We were then reseated in another room with desert views with other seated guests. John did not ask us if the table for 2 was acceptable, just steering us in that direction. My husband was not happy that we were not given a choice of tables, after seeing other couples sitting at tables for four. We had heard about the restaurant and were looking forward to a memorable dining experience. Instead, our evening was ruined. Huge disappointment!  Update: The manager reached out to us shortly after I posted this review 2 years ago, offering us a complimentary meal upon our return. We have not been back."}
{"text":"In the spirit of Josh D.'s post, I will argue that Sassi does NOT have the best gourmet Italian food west of the Atlantic.  In fact, I wasn't impressed with the food here at all.  We had the chef's tasting menu for $59 per person and the wine pairings for $39.  Cocktails - I had the apple/ginger fizz which was not at all fizzy, too sweet and had mint leaves that had browned in it.    The bar snacks course was decent.  A selection of bruschettas and some olives.  Not bad, but not stellar.  Appetizers - We were brought a large plate of assorted appetizers.  Grilled beets, caramelized fennel, spicy calamari, broccoli rabe, and some other things that were quite forgettable apparently.  This plate, though impressive in appearance, was an all around failure.  My group consisted of some very adventurous eaters, and this didn't cut it even for them.  The tastes just didn't meld, and it just felt \"off.\"  Salad - The salad seemed like it was nothing more than bagged lettuce with some sliced carrots and radishes in dressing.  VERY disappointing.  Pasta - Probably the highlight of the night.  The pasta was so perfectly cooked, it was heavenly.  It was served with Lima beans, greens, bread crumbs & Parmesan in some light olive oil.  I have to mention, however, that my plate had a million Lima beans and no greens.  My mom's plate, however, had all greens, barely any Lima beans.  What's up with that?  Main course - I was given the seared Ahi, my husband the lamb sausage and my mom the halibut in bag.  The ahi was barely seared and cold, the lamb sausage was completely dry and over cooked and when my mom opened her bag, it stunk up the entire, albeit beautiful, dining room with fish smell.  I'm sorry, that's just not acceptable.  We got a special assortment of deserts, which was nice, and they were probably our favorite part of the night.  Oh and from the room we were seated in, you could hear the chef screaming bloody murder at his staff now and again.  That's all well and fine if you're Gordon Ramsay and your patron's know what they're in for, but we came for an intimate, elegant dinner... please shut up.  Anyway, I only give this restaurant 3 stars because of how amazingly beautiful it is.  So while I won't say to never come here, in my opinion, you'd be much better served to stop in for some \"bar snacks\" and wine than having a full meal."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Scottsdale. Great wine selection and amazing property. Always special around sunset. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was here for a wedding. The food was great, service was spectacular, the atmosphere was top notch. The server was very attentive to my girlfriend's gluten allergy and even took her back to the kitchen while the best man was giving his speech to go over the meal with her. That got it the 5th star. Great place for a wedding or just dinner."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us, and our dining experience was excellent!     With reservations at 6pm (Feb. 24, 2012), we were seated on the patio facing southwest, so the setting Sun gave us a very pleasant show with Pinnacle Peak standing tall beside it.  The air grew chilly quickly after sunset, but the patio has numerous adjustable propane/gas towers, and our waiter promptly adjusted one nearby to keep us cozy.  Though it was a Friday evening with a wedding reception going on below us, the noise level was not noticeable, and we spoke to each other comfortably as if we were in someone's living room.    We started with cocktails and wine, and shared various appetizers: risotto (very good), eggplant baked in a marinara sauce (also very good), and \"fingerling\" potatoes which seemed to be enjoyed by others but had a strange spice which I did not care for.  As for entrees, we had two orders of grouper, two orders of sea bass, one of halibut, and one of veal chops.  The fish dishes were prepared perfectly and did not have a \"fishy\" taste.  The veal dish was also superbly prepared, as everyone voiced pleasure with their entrees.    For dessert, some of us only had coffee, but three of us had profiteroles (a trio of small cream puffs filled with a sampling of different ice creams: vanilla, chocolate, and amaretto - very pleasant).   Service was excellent. For the 6 of us, the total was under $500 including drinks and taxes (but excluding tip).  What can I say?  I wouldn't know how to script a more delightful dinner anywhere."}
{"text":"Best. Dinner. Of 2011.  Amazing service and DELICIOUS food. Dark, elegant ambiance for a special occasion. I blew my budget...but with zero regret.  Don't miss Sassi if your in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I initially became aware of Sassi after a girlfriend got married here a few years back, I remember at the time being super impressed with not only how stunningly beautiful the location was but shocked at how delicious the food was. I have been back a few times since for happy hour and cocktails until a few weeks back when I finally made it in for dinner with some girlfriends.   The food and cocktails were great, I had their limoncello martini it was beyond delicious and worth coming back just for that! We started off with an order of their Wood Grilled Octopus and the Pork and Veal Meatballs! Both were delicious and flavorful, I was personally a huge fan of their Octopus! I had their special of the evening which was a osso bucco pasta dish which was to die for, and my girlfriends each had the Branzino and the Wagyu Flat Iron Steak. We all absolutely loved our food, but we honestly felt pretty rushed. We waited to order our entrees until after we had finished our starters just so we could space it out and we were shocked when our entrees came out no less than 10 minutes after we placed our order. In the future we will ask to space our meals out a bit more. Otherwise everything was perfect!   A must if your looking for a off the beaten path romantic hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is the place I have decided to take our family for special occasions its absolutely incredible everything from the views to the wait staff to the views it never seems to dissapoint the only thing I will tell you is that just like other very nice places in the area you will pay a premium to go there."}
{"text":"Scottsdale select restaurant snobbery at it's best!  Poor service in the bar asked waiter to go to the front reception desk and tell them that our table was ready at 8 p.m and he blew us off and didn't do what I asked so I had to go up myself and when I told the 2 young gals our dinner reservation was ready they looked surprised. Defenitely not on top of it. Folks this as a 5 star restaurant with questionable service and small plates of food which are however well prepared."}
{"text":"This review is for just the wedding service and dinner. I can't comment on whether this review would be the same if I dined there but I need to give them some credit where credit is due.   Sooooo........our friends are getting married. We RSVP as typical vegans, hacking up the menu/plated dinner choices to accommodate us(would you expect anything else)? We get asked a few weeks before \" are you sure you really don't want cheese? \" Uh...yeah, we're sure.   Sassi probably isn't the type of place we would normally ever go. We don't mind finer dining establishments but the place is like a huge Tuscan compound in the middle of the desert. Speaking of desert, even though the location if far from most everywhere, the Troon/Pinnacle Peak area is some nice acreage. I can see some people really loving this place and I will admit it all is done very well and is impressive, just not our thing.   Onto the wedding dinner, our cards were color coded with a \"jewel\" based on our dining preferences. You got the beef tenderloin it's black, chicken blue, eggplant purple, of course ours were pink for \"the difficult, PITA, vegan meal someone has to make\". I was honestly expecting for something to be wrong and/or a complete  miss and that we would be stopping at Taco Bell on the way home. I was really prepared to go back to the kitchen to show and tell the chef \" see, this is how EASY it is to prepare something Vegan \". None of that happened.   We got our first course, salad. Everyone was pretty much getting the same thing and one of the servers attempted to put one in front of me but the other server dude said \"NO...This is a VEGAN\" and proceeded to give me my veganized special salad. Wow, I felt so special. This guy was like the vegan Nazi, no animal products were getting near me if this guy was around!! Second course came, pasta,  and it was excellent as well. It was obvious there was no cheese on ours but the server even made a point to whisper to me that this pasta is vegan as well. I would never expect it not to be but it was a nice reassurance. Third course we were expecting a veganized version of eggplant parm but they ended up pulling out something completely different. It was a silken tofu, crusted in some nuts and a sweet tangy sauce with some vegetables and couscous on the side. It was a complete shocker. I don't love silken tofu but it was pretty darned good and a nice surprise.   All in all everything exceeded my expectations. I wonder if they would be this accommodating if I was a dinner guest? I am not sure, I looked at the dinner menu and they don't have lots of options but maybe I should give them a shot. If the vegan Nazi is around I am sure he would take care of me."}
{"text":"Beautiful facility, inconsistent service and  food. The Octopus was excellent, the baby green salad was quite generous and tasty. The squash blossom appetizer was tasteless but the eggplant cakes were very good. The branzino had a sauce that was too oily and lacked balance, the veal chop was very fatty and unndercooked but the lamb was good."}
{"text":"5/22/13  Placed my reservation through OpenTable a few days beforehand.  I arrived around 45 minutes earlier than my other table mates, so I used some of the time to check with the kitchen to see if the selections I'd wanted to try off of the RW menu would be allergen-free (for me).  It seemed like I would have some trouble with the dessert menu (I'd wanted the cannoli, but that was ruled out), but after conferring with the kitchen, the hostess said that the gelati and sorbetti were safe.  This initially anticlimactic for me, but boy, was I in for a surprise!    As I was making my way through the courtyard (boy, this property was HUGE) looking for the source of people conversing and laughing, I decided I'd let my friends know I was waiting for them, but they snuck up on me and was at my side before I finished clicking \"send.\"  Turns out the large group of people ahead of us was part of a wedding reception, so we quickly tried to find our way to the host's stand somewhere inside the cavernous restaurant.  My friends asked me if this was a resort, and I told them that I only knew it to be a restaurant.  (On our way to our table, I posed the question to the host, to which he replied that Sassi was only a restaurant, albeit one that also held many banquets.)  We were the first ones seated at one of the rooms that had patio dining overlooking gorgeous views, including Pinnacle Peak.  We each were handed wine and dinner menus, but only one RW menu, so I asked for another.    Since I knew I was going to order the panna cotta app and the tagliatelle as my main, I decided to go with a glass of Arneis ($13).  My two friends ordered glasses of Barbaresco ($17 each).  I enjoyed my glass of white-- vanilla-scented, not too dry, and I loved the apricot and pear notes.  (I need to locate a bottle, or two, to have some at home.)  This glass held well through the app and main, as well as dessert, but I'm getting ahead of myself...  My table mates decided they'd try the other apps and entrees featured on the RW menu, so that we may all get to sample everyone's plates.  The Parmigiano and roasted garlic panna cotta app was lovely! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ#5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ  I've had panna cotta before, so I'd expected something much lighter, more gelatinous; This was akin to a cheese spread- dense, creamy, yet slightly crumbly.  While I loved the garlicky crostino, I found it heavily dressed.  A lighter hand with the parmigiano would've sufficed.  Still, I enjoyed the app immensely!  The house made tagliatelle, with artichoke pesto and fava beans, dusted with pecorino cheese, was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ#rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ  Exquisite in its presentation, temperature wasn't too hot, buttery, and yes, rich, but not too much so that I couldn't finish it.  In fact, I exercised restraint, only so that I could also enjoy the chocolate and vanilla gelati and apricot sorbetto for dessert (choice of three scoops). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q#ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q  My fave was the apricot-- tasted so fresh and crisp; AMAZING apricot flavor!  The gelati felt too heavy in comparison, and quite frankly, a tad boring.  My three scoops of dessert at my next visit to Sassi will definitely be all sorbetti!  These are what my friends ordered: Sicilian Eggplant Cakes- currants, pine nuts, tomato sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA#aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA  Wood grilled gamberoni- shrimp, cannellini bean, salsa verde http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ#677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ  Cannoli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNg#M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNg Farro salad- goat cheese, mint, red onion, cucumber, pistachio, and red wine vinaigrette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ#5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ  (Tried this, in spite of pistachio allergy and liked it a lot!  Would've had more, but I spotted cukes in there, too.) Beef short rib- red wine-braised, porcini, citrus herb gremolata http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg#4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg  Semifreddo, with fresh berries and balsamic vinegar http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=fI2Sl74-spyxAnG27V2Wnw#fI2Sl74-spyxAnG27V2Wnw  (Tried the semifreddo only and found it creamy, yet muted in flavor.  The chill factor was also not very pronounced.  I really preferred my dessert!)  If you decide to go, you MUST get the Wood grilled octopus!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q#xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q  It's the best octopus preparation I've ever experienced!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I attended a friend's wedding here and the venue is absolutely beautiful. The only thing is it's a little rural located and I had a little trouble trying to find it even using Google Maps. The venue itself is absolutely gorgeous and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Really was excited to eat at Sassi! Went out for our 15th wedding anniversary and was looking forward to an amazing dinner- heard so many good things. Gave the restaurant 2 stars for their beautiful ambience and grounds. Really limited menu, but my husband and I can usually always find something we like. Food was very mediocre , sea food was very , very fishy tasting. I was surprised at how bland the food was considering how many people suggested coming here. I'd maybe return for cocktails and an appetizer / but even that would be a stretch. All courses for dinner were just ok. Our waiter was very nice, however."}
{"text":"I came here from a wedding, which I know is probably different than going to the actual restaurant. However, I cannot rave enough about the food. Usually wedding food is blah and dry. NOT this wedding. OMG, the chicken was amazing, the beef whatever it was, was AMAZING. Everything was so tender and delicious. We had a salad which was excellent, a penne alla vodka patas, also excellent (they had a gluten free option too!). Everything was amazing. The wedding was beautiful. it was raining and everything seemed to be seamless. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Heard a lot about Sassi. I travelled and lived in Italy so without bragging I know Italian food.  The waiter was just ok and tried hard to be Italian but failed miserably. We ordered wine a 2010 Valdizani, they brought a 2012 which I sent back.....waiter apologized that they were out of 2010, I asked him why he didn't say so rather than sneaking a 2012 on me. The somalier took over and brough an amazing wine.  We ordered caprese salad, which was amazing, the buffalo was perfect so was the tomatoes. Next a gnocchi with mushroom, meh too salty and was not gnocchi rather under cook pasta, not al dente, but under cooked. Then we ordered a farmers salad which had very few vegetables and an enormous amount of grains....little flavor. Then we had the chefs special, duck which is my favorite. Unfortanely it was chewy and slathered in a an overpowered fruit sauce, I had 3 regular duck bites that was it. Finally dessert, we ordered nutella pudding, with some sort of cake on top, pudding was flavorful but they cake was dry a minimum 2 days old.  Ambiance very nice but the food doesn't mesaure up to the price.  Sorry  Sassi not coming back."}
{"text":"Really sad that they got rid of the bone in veal chop. The veal bistecca does not compare. The fava beans that come with the bistecca are awful, too. Way undercooked.  Not a fan of the management at all. When told that they should bring back the veal chop I got a pretty snotty reply and attitude.  Also, the martinis are the smallest in all of Scottsdale and not very good.   However, the ambiance is to die for and the food is above par.  All of the appetizers are fabulous, especially the eggplant cakes appetizer, the baby beets appetizer and pork and veal meatballs."}
{"text":"This review doesn't really matter since Sassi is set to close, anyways. However! If you're planning on going there before it closes, you should read this:  Amazing ambiance, delicious food, the best bread I've ever eat, and bad service. We came for a bachelorette dinner as a group of 8 - and I should note this was not a CRAZY bach party, it was a reserved and classy evening. We had reservations, and were still treated as an inconvenience. I ordered the carbonara and an espresso martini, both exceeded my expectations. But again, they are set to close soon.   If you are looking for authentic Italian food with authentic European service, at a high price, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We can here for dinner the other night and thought the food wasn't bad. Heard they're closing soon and they're pretty far north of Scottsdale. The food menu is pretty small but they have a great wine selection. The decor is nice and the location setup for a really nice view of the sunset.   We came in a large group and I had the flank steak, which was done well. It came on a bed of blue cheese, which was a bit much for me. I had the cauliflower as a side and it could have used some more seasoning. One of my friends got the veal chop, which was highly recommended and we both agreed that mine was better. The veal came with a mushroom coating, which I thought want dinner will and felt really gritty in the mouth.   If you're in the area and make it before it closes, it's worth a so but don't know if I would come out one my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm  old school??? Or maybe it's the clientele or location - I'd like to be asked if I'm satisfied with my plating .......for some reason the staff focused on my husband. 'Is the appetizer ok Mr Haelen?\" How is your lamp chop Mr Haelen?' Very strange.......I care!!!!!! Also the tiramisu was served in a mason jar? I am so confused! Something is not right!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Food was exceptional, the service fantastic, atmosphere just right.  A great place to take a date, where you can relax at one of the many tables indoors or enjoy the night sky out on the patio.  I had the dish with wild boar (I can't remember the name of it in Italian) it was superb!  The menu was very extensive and had everything, ranging from mussels to grass fed beef and even vegetarian options.  Our waitress also told us that the chefs try to buy locally as much as possible, which is a huge plus for me.    The restaurant is very expensive so make sure you go with an open mind and an open wallet."}
{"text":"Th atmosphere at Sassi is second to none. The food lives up to expectations very nicely. The caprese was one of the best I've ever had. All of our entrees were cooked to perfection. Will be back to Sassi soon. See you so soon, Sassi!"}
{"text":"We are locals and have eaten here twice in the last week (and quite often in the past).  The good - the food is OK. Not great, certainly not bad. You'll have a few better local options - consider Gianfrancos, Local Bistro or Pane e Vino.  Our server on both nights was excellent. The overall dining environment is excellent. They have a reasonable set menu and a good wine offering (from $30 to $70 for some really excellent wines.  But here's what's really weird: - Some guy floats by and asks you 'how's the food' and he's nearly gone before you have time to answer. I doubt he really cares!! - The have a 15% coupon offer (we were hoping to use ours last night) but it doesn't apply to the set menu...but no where was that stated beside the set menu.   On the way out, the woman at the greeter desk looked at us askance and was somewhat dismissive when we honestly told her about our experience - no class. The young woman at the desk looked at bit horrified.  So I would suggest you give this a pass - I'd expect a lot more given the typical cost of a meal here....we won't be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT book an event at this venue.  They will do everything they can to get your deposit.  This venue is beautiful and one-of-a-kind in Arizona which makes it very easy to hand over your money.  DO NOT.    The venue IS CLOSING permanently in May.  There is no guarantee that they will actually stay open to host your event or care about the quality of your event.  You will lose your money and end up heartbroken about your venue choice."}
{"text":"Took my fiancée here for our 2 year engagement anniversary- was not disappointed. We ended up there around 8:30, not too many people in the place which was nice. Our server Tricia was incredible, we're somewhat new to the fancy dining scene and she could definitely tell (at least I was). She described things that we asked about and was very knowledgeable on the menu/selections and gave us plenty of options on how to work out what we wanted- even accommodating sharing by bringing out extra plates. Even though I look 16 (I'm 25) and we were definitely the youngest people there- nobody treated us any differently and that's hard to come by in an upscale business. (Sincerely, thank you for that.) We had a bottle of wine, some amazing food and a very relaxed dinner. Everything was cooked well and the serving size was bigger than what we expected. Even though we ordered some cannolis to bring home, they brought us some extra cannolis for our celebration which we greatly appreciated- although they were difficult to eat with full bellies... haha I'm glad I decided to take her here but I am very sad to hear that they will be closing soon. Get here while you can because it is worth every dollar."}
{"text":"The ambiance is so nice! A beautiful place just to sit and look at view and relax. The food is nice and not priced to high. I haven't been here for a long time, but will return. I liked our overall experience taking people from out of town."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our anniversary.  This place is beautiful! We got here a couple minutes early and went to the bar and had a couple drinks. We were then seated at our table and resented with the menu. Everything looked so delicious we had a hard time deciding. Every course was perfect and beautifully presented. the best for me was the Orecchiette con Salsiccia, past shaped like pig ears with sausage. It was soooo good.  For the main dish my husband got stuffed veal, I had to steal a couple bites :), and I got a seasonal fish, I forget what it was called. We ordered a dessert, the Baba cake, not knowing that they were going to serve us an Anniversary dessert, $9, since my husband told them our special occasion when he made the reservation. Still it was wonderful, 2 cannolis served on a plate with \"Buon Anniversario\" written on the plate.   I just wish it wasn't so chilly outside because the patio looked like a lovely place to sit when the weather is right."}
{"text":"This place is fa-reaking palatial.  Walking into this restaurant is on par with getting on a cruise ship or starting your first day of college.  Lots of 'pretty' girls up front too;  but what giamungious restaurant doesn't these days? Anyway...  The food was good, but  I can't say I jizzed my pants eating it.  The waiter was exceptionally helpful, almost snootily so, which is nice when your dropping a few Benji's on grub, but dude an alfredo sauce is made from butter, cream, garlic, cheese etc, not from a modified scampi sauce.  I thought the wine selection was large and in charge, but sadly was almost all Italian (viva la france!). They're very specific about when you get yer bread too. (NO BREAD FOR YOU!)  The massive positive here was the salmon.  This dish could'a made me mousse my shorts.  Wish I had ordered it and not the Gnocchi.    Dessert absolutely sucked donkey anus.  Mine was actually stale (some apple cake thing).  Coulda just got a bad one, I know this can happen.      I give you three stars Sassi, you're cool looking and would probably get me laid if I weren't taken already... and assuming my date has no taste buds and is slightly touched in the head.    I may come back and eat the salmon again.   Assuming it's still available.  Gigity."}
{"text":"I usually avoid italian food, but Sassi's menu looked so interesting that I absolutely had to dine there. Having dated a person of italian heritage in a past life, I was aware that genuine italian food tastes completely different from what silly americanos expect. It's not the same over flavored cheesy mess that we serve in our americanized italian restaurants.   So having said that, it's a possibility that our palates were not on the right taste setting when we ate out that night - because I thought presentation was much better than taste.  The waiter described how dinner would be served and informed of the varied-sized dishes letting us know which ones would be good to share. We were amused to receive clean silverware and plates for every course. Then I remembered that's how the italian I dated used to eat. I used to complain back then, but I can eat like this all the time as long as I'm not washing dishes.  The bread basket was filled with bites of freshly cut bread and brought to the table with a bottle of evoo. I noticed 3 different breads, one which was similar to focaccia, but I can't say for sure. So fresh and breadly; they were cut from the kind of loaves that you could eat as a meal.   Off the menu, we ordered from each of the four sections and even stayed for dessert.  1. SPUNTINI   - roasted peppers with garlic and oregano bruschetta ($4)  - taleggio, apple, almond pesto bruschetta ($4) - plate of friti zucchini with aioli $8  The bruschetta portions were smaller than I expected and there was minimal topping so it was an all around disappointment. After tasting, I forgot what I was eating. I did not appreciate the paired flavors and couldn't distinguish the almond. I would recommend skipping this app. It just made me sad and left me wanting something else.  The friti is worth getting if you want to tie yourself over until food comes and would rather avoid the bread basket. Not sure what the batter is called but it's very crispy, flaky, and fun and left the zucchini firm. Aioli compensates for missing seasoning in the friti.   2. ANTIPASTI  - grilled octopus with lentils, chiles, and olives ($15) - sicilian style eggplant cakes with currants, pinenuts, and tomato sauce ($9) - gamberoni dish of shrimp and proscuitto in butter ($14)  The octopus will totally catch you off guard. I took a small bite - it was tender and did not taste like any octopus I've had before. It took me a while to describe the flavor and the closest thing I can think of is - a seafood sausage.   The shrimp were served in shell with head on.  The best part of the eggplant dish was the sauce and I slathered that in my mouth with bread. Yum. The eggplant itself was weird. Only two small cakes were served but it seemed like each cake was made by different people. The first cake was good and made from one piece of eggplant. I didn't notice any pine nuts or currants. The second cake was make of diced eggplant, lots of pine nuts, and was so chewy that i couldn't swallow it. I tried three bits of it and I spit out every bit.   3. PRIMI  Pasta dish and a fish dish. Seasoning wasn't much.  4. CONTORNI  - brussels sprouts with capers, chile, and lemon ($7) - roasted mushrooms with shallots and thyme ($10) - fingerling potatoes with rosemary ($6)  Topside brussels of the spouts dish were burnt so I had to peel away those leaves, but the deliciousness of the rest made up for it. I didn't taste chile or capers but I love greens and would definitely order this again.   I would not order the mushrooms again. Some of them turned out rubbery and I think this dish would have fared much better as sauteed. Also, there were not enough shallots or thyme.  I'm on the fence about whether I would order the potatoes again. They tasted okay with very light seasoning. (Not enough rosemary.)  DESSERT  - canoli with pistachios and chocolate nuggets $9  Made with sweetened ricotta cheese and a house made wafer. Best canoli I've tasted. Definitely recommend this.  So, overall if you want superb service and prime ambiance, go to Sassi. (5 stars) If you want a superb meal, go somewhere else (3 stars) because you will spend all of your pretty pennies here."}
{"text":"Is it expensive?  Absolutely!  Is it divine?  Absolutely!  We went there for our Anniversary and the entire place knocked us out.  Extremely clean and impeccably designed location.  From the moment we walked in , we were treated like royalty.    The food was amazing.  We started with a Fettunta:  Grilled bread with the most amazing organic heirloom tomatoes.  We tasted the Pizza Margarita.....we had the Pork Chop and the Linguini with Day Boat Shrimp.  Oh, so very, very good!  Everything was very light and rustic.    Then, they brought an Anniversary Cannoli on a plate which said\" Buon Anniversario!\"  in chocolate script!  It was compliments of the restaurant!  Perfect end to a meal.  Mike is an awesome waiter and I'll request him again when I go back.  Then we went into the bar.  The drinks were a little expensive for my taste (who'd have thought!) but the bar tender told us about the  current Happy Hour from -5-7 when all the snacks and appies are half off and wine is currently 25% off.  That would make a pretty tasty little meal.  Now if the drive weren't so long......  But what an exciting night!  And do try to sit on the patio.  We didn't and I wish we would have requested it.  Gorgeous.  Hats off to the Chef."}
{"text":"The most notable thing about Sassi is the ambience.  The restaurant is located within an Italian villa, with eating rooms scattered here and there.  The building is impressive but the star is the outdoor patio which features mountain and desert views, spectacular especially at sunset.    The food might not quite make five stars but the view -- ah, the view.  BIG HINT:  Get a patio table.  Request it on your reservation and go early particularly on busy days.  As to the food, Sassi clearly uses very high quality ingredients, and the kitchen staff prepares everything well.  I can site the very fresh greens and goat cheese in our salad, and an exceptional branzino.  However, in all cases, the flavor profiles are nothing special - salt and pepper and lemon they know about, but there are few other spices, and the sides to the entrees were uninspired, and in one case, inedible (stringy broccolini).  For two people, with a carafe of sangria, olives, two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert and coffee, the tab came to $160 including tax and tip.  Not cheap but just about right for what Sassi delivers.  SMALL HINT:  Since you want to see sunset from your patio table, April and May are the best months to go.  The temperature outside will probably be great, and sunset occurs late enough so that you can watch it during your dinner."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant! The decor was very comfortable. Staff was awesome. They did a great job and you never knew they were there. Octopus and Caprese to start. Both out of this world. I had orechetti that was fabulous. Wife tried ricotta gnocchi. I loved it and she liked it but found it a little rich. Cannoli's awesome as well. I would have went 5 stars if not for one thing. Hostess takes us to our table and we walk directly outside and not asked if it was ok or not. I went with it because it was a nice patio area and it didn't feel too hot. By the end of our meal I was hotter than s&/t and watched other people around us fight off bugs the size of black birds. I will never sit outside again! If I would have spoke up and asked to stay inside we would have had a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant & view, a bit dark inside, great food, & good service. For such a nice restaurant, it seemed really strange that they served some desserts in mason jars, which are, from my sense, far from classy & more something typical to see in a young, hipster, casual restaurant.  Lovely appetizers, though I wish they offered Melanzane alla Parmigiana. I also wish they offered tiramisu on the dessert menu. It seems like they definitely poured a great deal of money into making this giant facility appear as close to an Italian villa as possible. It's pretty."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Sassi for my Birthday dinner and it was wonderful. We loved the octopus appetizer, the pastas were delicious, as was the duck. Romantic, beautiful ambiance and delicious food."}
{"text":"Love! Love!  Love! As we were driving ti this restaurant from Tempe, I had No Idea where we were. It was dark, random roads up in pinnacle peak and wondering where in the world is my husband taking us for our anniversary. Once we got there, i loved the feel of the restaurant. Felt so romantic with a lights of the phoenix city lights.   We were seated with a fabulous server who explained the menu items perfectly! We had the signature octopus that was delicately grilled and so tender. Then the ricotta gnocchi that just melted in my mouth. I then had the yellowfin tuna with had some Heat! Yowzer! My husband had the scallops that were cooked perfectly. The dessert was awesome too! Pear brown cake was SO GOOD!!!! I wish I could go back right now. Definitely recommend even with the long drive."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with an exceptional menu.  Great summer specials.  A little hot inside.  The temperature is set for Phoenicians who are acclimated to the heat."}
{"text":"It's unanimous....\"Delicious\" from everyone who was there! We had amazing Florida Red Snapper, Scallops with Ink pasta x 2 and a bone in Veal cutlet that was so tender, it melts in your mouth. We shared a bottle of 2011 Cain Five that was a perfect accompaniment to everything. The service was spot on; they were prompt, professional and very nice. The atmosphere is very romantic. For dessert we each had something different but all were very tasty, as was the coffee / cappuccino. We would recommend and dine there again."}
{"text":"Sassi is a magnificent hidden Scottsdale Italian villa with lots of rooms with much charm.  You feel like you are in Italy for sure.  Very romantic place.  AS indicated however, it's a bit pricey. Great for Special occasions .  The outside cafes are fantastic with views of local mountains. FOOD was great as well as the service.  All 4 of us ate different dishes and everyone was very happy."}
{"text":"Had the lamb. It was delicious. The atmosphere and views were wonderful. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance!  We started off with the Prosciutto di Parma which was great.  We had the Pan Seared Sea Scallops and Orecchiette and they were delicious. For dessert I enjoyed the Gianduja Mousse.  OH MY NUTELLA!  Which was a hazelnut and milk chocolate mousse, nutella gelato.  It was to a memorable experience all together.  I can see why folks have their corporate events and wedding receptions here.  It is a beautiful facility.  The staff and Manager is super friendly and checked in on us which was nice.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Romantic and beautiful. I suggest to start in the Piano bar and enjoy a cocktail and then be seated outside on patio next to fireplace. Service and food are exceptionally good. Dress up and enjoy the elegant back drop. Wonderful private dining room too"}
{"text":"I recently went to Sassi and was very impressed.  I think it's the surrroundings and restaurant that really got to me, but the food is great too.   The restaurant looks and feels like an Italian villa...it would be a perfect, but pricey first date choice.  If you're looking for a noisy, family-friendly Italian restaurant, this isn't it. But if you want to have an intimate dinner with your significant other in an elegant setting, I recommend Sassi. And if you don't mind a third wheel, take me with you."}
{"text":"For starters the atmosphere and scenery is absolutely gorgeous. The service was impeccable. Our server (Tony) was very knowledgeable not only on the menu items but had an extensive wine knowledge as well . He throughly explained each course and made great reccomendations for our first time dining here. After making our dinner selection he recommended a wine that paired beautifully. We started with the octopus which was amazing. I ordered the veal and my boyfriend had a ragu of some sort. He loved his, however I wasn't impressed with mine.  It was overpowered with a pungent salty and also acidic flavor to the point I couldn't take a second bite. Had it remade without the anchovy spread hoping that would make it less salty but it wasn't much better the second time around. The flavors just didnt balance well in my opinion. I will be back to give the food another try solely because the service and customer interaction was stellar!"}
{"text":"Let's hope this was just a horrible misfire from a normally on-target Italian establishment. Our group was guided into the bar to await our table. The property is pristine, suggesting something special is at hand. Hardly.   Waiting outside in the bar, the metal chairs were hard and uncomfortable. Our server never offered us a cushion from a stack that was just outside of view but revealed once we headed to our table. Strike one. Once seated on the patio for dinner, the tablecloth barren plastic table top should have continued the elegance of the building instead of looking like a park picnic cast off. Our server (name withheld but available to the restaurant upon request) was the centerpiece of the poor service parade that passed before us. We had to ask for water (kind of comical considering it was 85 degrees outside) and getting any kind of descriptive information about the wonderful menu was a comic skit in action. Portion sizes were described as \"you know, about average\" while the reply to my order for the veal chop was acknowledged by a single word utterance of \"cool\". Strike two. We also had to ask for bread, then olive oil, then balsamic. Keep in mind this is not an inexpensive Italian restaurant nor was it busy; higher standards of service should accompany any meal where the bill is above $300 for a party of 5. Our wine selection was completely different (variety and vintner) than ordered and when pointed out, was dismissed as \"that's what the manager gave me\".   The food was marvelous and we would have relayed that to the server had we been asked. She never appeared to check on our meals until proffering up the desert menu. Another 10 minutes passed and she finally appeared seeking our order. Strike 3.  Not able to determine if this was poor training or poor attitude. I usually give points for effort but unfortunately saw almost none here. While the food, including a terrific octopus dish was a pleasure to the taste, the service experience was unexpectedly bitter."}
{"text":"It was awesome!! Sad It took me 11 years to find this place. Worst thing about that I live less than 2 miles away! Great place for date night, family, and they had a wedding going on as well. Beautiful place, great food!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had two of the most unsatisfying meals we have had in years.  My boar pasta was about 50 percent fat.  It was almost impossible to dissect the fat from the meat.  My wife's pork ragu had  extremely odd taste.  Neither dish had any positive flavor. A side order did not arrive with our entrees but came so late we had to bag it to take it home. We ate at the bar and the server  was excellent, but not good enough to salvage a meal we hope to forget.  We will not miss Sassi when they close."}
{"text":"I recently attended a wedding at Sassi. The venue was beautiful and the food was excellent. I would recommend this venue to anyone looking to get married in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food, ambiance and friendly staff...did I say ambiance...oh so beautiful, If I was was going to get married again, it would be there! but he better be making bank or it till be at the buffalo chip instead..haha j/k,  The hilight of my meal was the ocotopus appetizer..OMG I would have had 4 of those instead of an Entree' SUPURB Daling as Zsa Zsa would say, btw, I do feel a but Green Acres out here just coming from LA..  I love it here for sure ! when youre in love the whole world is delicious, Its so true ! xxxx"}
{"text":"first visit here ordered drinks at bar moved to a table because patio door kept opening and a cold breeze non stop moved to a corner table no one has been by to take a dinner order great us the table is still dirty from prior guests. no one even walked by to grab them. went back to bar to cash out since in the process of being ignored i called mastero's for a table for 2 where we will surely get good customer service. The bartender w0 min later asked if anyone had been by knowing it was our first visit it's date night after a long week as we STILL are here no one came by to apologize try to remedy situation $40 drinks could have been a $200 tab and some regulars. we eat out 7 nights a week and were trying to find a new spot clearly this isn't it."}
{"text":"what a beautiful location!  was here for a wedding over the weekend and having been to a million weddings over the past couple of years, i have to say this was one of the most beautiful spots.  the food was pretty good, a little bit heavy on the lemon, but overall, i was very impressed.  i would love to come back here and try out their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and had an absolutely exceptional experience.  First off, the view is one of the best in the valley.  We sat on the patio... on one side was Pinnacle Peak, on the other was the McDowells, and in between was a view of the valley all the way to South Maintain.  Breathtaking at sunset!    Food was fantastic.  The octopus was perfect.  I would go back just for that.  For mains we had the short ribs and the osso buco.  Both were delicious.  Also, they have an in house aged rye Manhattan.  It was the best Manhattan I have ever had... and I've had alot.  Service was spot on... always there when we needed something... and gone when we didn't.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place was recommend by a friend who lives in the area. Firstly the sunset drive to the location is something of dreams. As you approach you walk past a pretty fountain and down steps to a long passageway inside the building.   We asked to sit outside next to the circular fireplace with a few table around it. The view from the back is outstanding. The menu has enough variety for all palates, even for vegetarian, and they are more than happy to accommodate. Our server was very polite and friendly. I wasn't very hungry so I shared a caprese and had a charred octopus on my own. Both were cooked to perfection.  This place is really outstanding for events. I remember thinking that I would like to have one of my own out here.  I hope to go back soon and sample much more of the food and spend a lot more time in the quiet of the desert."}
{"text":"You know those weeks where you just want to sink into a comfortable chair and relax when its all done? I had that experience on Friday night at Sassi, and it was perfect. It was great to be so attentively waited on, and the atmosphere with friends was enjoyable after the long week.  The Sassi GM, Stephen, was kind enough to welcome NVFN (North Valley Friday Nights) to Sassi last Friday. He had an area at the bar set aside for us and provided an assortment of \"pickies\" :D  lovely little things for us to snack on like toasted nuts, olives and flatbread. He also extended the happy hour menu for us. The wine was flowing and the food was great as always- we had the margarita pizza, the eggplant involtini, the skewered beef and the stuff squah blossoms. Everything was perfect.  Sassi is definitely one of my faves, thanks so much for having us, we'll be back very soon"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service.  Had a minor glitch with my entree but it was remedied very quickly.  I would definitely eat here again and recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Went to Sassi The last week of November. It was our 4yr anniversary, so they gave us a some champagne on the house to celebrate it.  Great start to the meal! Sadly, The food was somehow not up to par. Started with some bruschetta to snack on...Meh, the bread just wasn't right, flavors were muddled and just decent.   I had the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Pulled pork tagliatelle (way too much meat going on, pasta was great, but overall, the dish was a little off). It was a big portion as well. I would have just stuck with one kind of pork, not two, and a touch more sauce. Osso bucco was salty, and not prepared the traditional way with the marrow. It reminded me more of a concentrated version of beef short ribs.  Just a few fingerling potatoes and over salted mushrooms scattered around the plate.  Not my favorite. The 3rd course consisted of this apple crepe thing. Seemed like an afterthought at best.  They also sent out a comped dessert for our anniversary which was a little cannoli, (It's the thought that counts).  It was a nice gesture, but there was nothing special about it at all.   Here is what really irked me.....My significant wanted a pasta dish, and asked if the pasta had a red sauce. Our server said yes so he ordered it. It came, and it had no such red sauce on it at all. We waited 10 minutes to flag someone down to fetch our server for us. He asked to have a red sauce with sausage in his orecchiette, like the original dish he thought he was getting in the first place! It came plain, nothing on it but sauce. At that point, it was useless to send it back again, so we just dealt with it. Our server even acknowledged that they forgot to put the meat in it, yet, when the bill came, we still ended up paying $18 for a small plate of orecchiette with red sauce and NOTHING else!  It's just funny, because the 6 top next to us pretty much sent half their main courses back as well.  We overheard our server telling them she thought the kitchen was 'off' that night.   We NEVER expect to get anything comped EVER!  What I DO expect is that if the kitchen/staff make a mistake, they should either FIX it and FIX it CORRECTLY or ADJUST the price!    The wedding open house we went to a month or so prior, had better food, and that was more of a buffet style atmosphere. The pasta was better, salad, apps, everything!  Hopefully they were just having an \"off\" night, but either way, it makes us think twice about EVER going back.   Our unfortunate experience at Sassi that night = 2 STARS  +1 STAR for my wonderful significant who made the most of our night even though the food was bad"}
{"text":"Extraordinary setting and experience while celebrating my birthday. Outstanding in every way. Joseph our server was top notch and the food was superb. We started off with cocktails at the bar and then ventured to my favourite table. I remembered the table number from years ago and YES it was still there wooo hooo.   Our appetizers were squash blossoms and bruschetta with prosciutto on one and tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella on another. Then for entrees, my friend had the eggplant cakes and I had the papardelle with spicy eggplant ragu. I could not have asked for better service as Joseph kept checking on us every couple of minutes along with his server assistant.  YES Sassi is totally worth it. Hard to believe I had not reviewed the restaurant yet but I don't even think Yelp was around back then. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"The ambience, the views, the food, the drinks and the service made the experience unforgettable.  My husband and I were celebrating a special occasion and we were treated like royalty. The food was absolutely succulent, fresh and full of flavor. The staff was was attentive and took care of our needs and was very curteous to say the least. We had a great experience at Sassi and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"We came back here last night to enjoy a nice pre-Mother's Day dinner.  We were here in March and the food was excellent but our server was mediocre. Last night we had Simon as our waiter and he did a phenomenal job! He was so knowledgeable about the wine list. I had the branzino on both visits. Last night they had it stuffed with crab. It was delicious both times but more so last night. We highly recommend sitting on the patio and enjoying the beautiful view and the tasty food and wine."}
{"text":"They have nice large wine glasses....just don't forget to ask if you like a large one... Enjoy"}
{"text":"4.5 stars, everything was absolutely spectacular including the service... except the booze. Try the caprese it's $20 but u can split with 4 people as a starter. Also the orechetta with sausage is to die for; the mushroom risotto is well prepared and both are quite rich so you will need to come up for air. The focaccia and olive bread served with EVOO is perfection also.  My general opinion on Italian food is that it's hard to screw up pasta, so why should it be pricey. Sassi proved me wrong, I was thoroughly impressed. Worth the price tag."}
{"text":"This is one of the most romantic, and comfortable restaurants we have been to in the Scottsdale area. The service and food, along with the presentation, was wonderful. If you want to have an exceptional evening, Sassi is the place! Roger McCartney"}
{"text":"Really glad we gave Sassi a second chance after being unimpressed the first time.  This time we were seated promptly, at a table type we requested.  The service was great and food wonderful.  The Gorgonzola fondue was amazing as was the veal risotto (stated as a first course but definately big enough for a meal.  Only complaint was that for dear Hubby the beer list is woefully small.  Other than that a very nice romantic and satisfying dinner."}
{"text":"Contacted by Sassi's management. It's good to know that \"John G\" is not a true representation of the company. I may or may not return, but it's nice to know management cares enough to try and right a wrong."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I had read some of the reviews and checked the restaurant ratings. It all looked good so we thought we would give it a try   What a mistake!  We started with the eggplant app and my partner had the octopus which both were very good .  It was all down hill from there   We ordered a simple pasta in a tomato sauce which was so bad we sent it back .  The pasta was followed by an entree of Branzino ( fish).   Not great !  There wines by the glass are of a very limited choice .  At the end of our meal the server offered us a canoli desert on the house  Very nice jester the only problem was they had no taste .    Too bad the food was not as good as the service   Views from patio.     5 star Ambiance.                 4 star  Service.                     4 star  Food.                         1 star  If your looking for a restaurant experience that has very thing but good food this is the  place  If your looking for good food make a reservation elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was an awesome experience to dine here. Waitstaff was attentive and food was delicious. Was so sorry to hear it was closing!"}
{"text":"i can't give this restaurant enough stars. the ambiance... the impeccable service... the gorgeous views of the sunset ..... and the food is off the chart.  i was celebrating my birthday, joseph was our server. joseph was the best of the best. upon taking our order his description of each dish was so delectable it made it almost impossible to select.... you want every single entree.  i can't wait yo go back. don't hesitate to go to sassi  you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"UPDATE.  Went there last year for my free veterans day dinner so did it again tonite. So here is how it went: 1.  bread came.  odd there was no butter but he olive oil was better pick anyway. 2.   Salad was ok. 3.  My friend had the chicken, with mashed potato's and veggie.  He liked.  I had the roast pork which was very tender and huge.  Great mashed potato's. Great dinner.  We were both pleased. 4.  very little room for desert but we tried. 5.  overall a great meal and the service was great.  It took a while for the food to come out but it was crowded and there was a big wedding party going on too, so they were busy there. 6.  Last year they charged us full tax on a $175 freebie and mandatory $22 tip.  This year the two meals would have cost anyone else $110 but we were just charged $15 for a few drinks, so we had more money for a tip.  Can't complain.  Very few people seem to know about their free veterans day meal.  It is not advertised.  It sure beats getting a free burger at Hooters! I spend a lot of time at the Scottsdale Gun Club, so after my next visit perhaps I will stop by here for the happy hour. The place is expensive but that nice plush building has a lot of overhead.  A good place to impress a date. Besides i was driving a new Lexus tonite so I fit right in."}
{"text":"Went there for Veteran's Day for dinner and let me tell you AAA+ on the meal and staff.  We were running late and they were very accommodating.  The staff was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed.  The food there is excellent and the atmosphere is beautiful.    If you want to impress someone or have a romantic night dinner then this is place to go.  A. W."}
{"text":"It's the closest you can get to actually eating in Italy.  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm a little behind on my yelp reviews but our first experience at Sassi was great. We went for our anniversary dinner last month and we were impressed. Service and food was great. The bruschetta was one of my favorites. We had amazing views overlooking the gorgeous patio and the desert landscape. The location is really the selling point and the food isn't far behind. Team Sassi!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Scottsdale!!!!!  I proposed to my wife outside in the back courtyard and it was perfect!  We were treated with smiles by the bar staff afterwards and given champagne!  4 months later we had our wedding reception here.  It was the best time I've ever had and the staff was absolutely fantastic!!  By far our favorite restaurant in all of Arizona.  Thank you Sassi!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the top five memorable meals that I have had and probably top 3 in Arizona.   Driving up to the location which is across the street from the former Pinnacle Peak Patio location which provides spectacular views of the city.   We decided to dine here to celebrate my wife's birthday and what a good choice it was.   Made reservations on Open Table and was called back the day before to confirm reservations, so I  asked the person what they would recommend as far as a sunset dinner with a 600pm reservation and the sunset at 615pm. She asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside and I asked her to recommend since this was out first time. She was leaning toward the patio and assured me she would take care of us.  As we walked up to Sassi the circular driveway was spectacular and the walkway leading to the front entry was even more breathtaking. As you walk in there is a separate building that a wedding reception was taking place which I heard can accommodate up to 150 people. As you walk past that you finally come to the front doors which are spectacular and you know your dining experience is to begin.  We were greeted at the front and taken to our table which was through a long hallway and outside to the patio. We were seated in which I considered the best spot on the patio on the corner overlooking Pinnacle Peak Mountain. So yes we were taken care of.  Our waiter Tony was excellent as he explained the many options of eating family style and then ordering the 2nd Main Course individually. We always had Tiny there or someone else to fill out glasses and make sure we were taken care of.  We started out with the Organic Radishes while we decided what we wanted to order, then ordered to share the Brushetta  (Tomato, Prochetta and Bean), Potatoes, Ricotta Gnocchi, Orcchiettta with Sassi Sausage, Wood Grilled Octopus and then they brought out their fresh baked goods in a basket.  My favorite was the Orcchiettta with home made Sassi Sausage, known as pig ear pasta, but the sausage was one of the best I have had and I am a huge fan of sausage. The Wood Grilled Octopus was good but was so hyped up that I preferred the Orcchiettta with Sausage a little more.  For our 2nd entrée we ordered the New York Strip, Wood Grilled Veal Chops and Wood Oven Roasted Quail. We all shared with each other and all the entrées were excellent and we'll prepared, and the presentation was impressive.   The New York Strip was a generous portion and cooked perfectly while the Wood Oven Roasted Quail was excellent and tender. The Wood Grilled Veal Chops were soft and tender and along with the mushroom sauce was incredible.   We finished our meal with the canolis that were a chocolate chip and 2 other flavors. Good tasting but not the best I have had.  The building is impressive as there are many different rooms or open dining area along with the expansive patio area.  Loved everything about the restaurant and the attention to detail that is put into the restaurant.   A special touch was how the management came around to ask us if everything was okay multiple times by different people.   Absolutely a memorable dining experience and a great way to celebrate a special occasion.   Would like to come back, just need to win the lottery to pay for the next meal :)  Spectacular is a one word to describe Sassi"}
{"text":"Wow!  Stopped by for a martini and was blown away by everything about this place.  Great atmosphere, great drinks and overall amazing staff.  Put on your Sport coat and make this a tradition.  You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Between Sassi and very few other restaurants in AZ that I won't plug now, the bar is set so high.  Sassi is class, food, and ambiance at its highest.  The location itself, set as an Italian Farm House in Pinnacle Peak is just priceless and beautiful.  The food....I strongly just doing a tasting course (cheaper in the summer)...is just phenomenal.  I would go here time and time again it finances allowed.  Sassi is an incredible treasure."}
