{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken with greens as a side. They give you 4 pieces of chicken. Decent portion size. The chicken is very juicy and crispy! The staff was very friendly. I would come back again and try the chicken and waffles next time!"}
{"text":"Didn't impress, just ok. Got a nice seat on the patio, which was awesome. Advertised a brisket burger, but they only cook it well done. Seriously - what's the point of a brisket cheeseburger that you're charging $16 for and you only cook it well done. That should have been an initial warning. Fried chicken was nice and crispy but needed more flavor. Kids loved the mac and cheese. Fries and chips were both fried just right."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and the food is very good - definitely going to be a go to spot of mine for as long as they keep pumping out quality food. Had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 though because the fried chicken seemed to be cooked in old oil, and while the chicken itself was moist and tender - probably still the best chicken i've had in Toronto - the skin had a very mild burnt aftertaste.  It probably sounds petty and maybe it is but that's something that's well within their control so for them to not do it, makes this a 4 star experience. The fried chicken is a winner - the Mac and cheese is my girlfriends favourite and she never finishes so I'm the lucky guy who gets to share those creamy leftovers with her later in the evening. Really want to try everything on the menu because it's all so delicious."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:30 for Sunday brunch with a party of 3 and was seated after waiting 15 minutes. The place fills up pretty quickly and there aren't too many tables so make sure you get here early.   We had the following dishes: 1) the benny - the sausage was surprisingly tastier than expected. It didn't taste fatty and wasn't too dry or oily. The hollandaise sauce was nice. You can substitute your side of potatoes for greens.  2) banana bread french toast - definitely on the sweeter side. Comes with three slices of bread doused in a very sweet caramel sauce - not recommended unless you have a sweet tooth.  3) scotch-ish eggs - two soft boiled eggs fried with panko served on a baguette. This is a very simple dish that comes with both greens and home fries. The eggs are unique but the panko comes off the egg easily once you cut into it.   I was looking forward to trying the blueberry cheesecake waffles but looks like it's out of season.   Lastly, we felt like we were being rushed out as soon as we finished our meal, but I guess you can't blame them since there was a pretty long line of people waiting.  Very reasonable prices - around $10/dish - you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Nice and homey dinners that are delicious.  I have been for dinner three times and only had the fried chicken for dinner and it is juicy and crispy.  I feel like the breakfast is where they shine even brighter than their dinner.  All i have to say is banana bread french toast!!!!  This dish is so different and so amazing.  It is quite filling so i would recommend sharing dishes with someone and splitting this.  Scotch eggs also top notch =)  Go here for a different breakfast that you can't make at home."}
{"text":"Not as good as I was expecting.  Ordered the half fried chicken with fries and took the \"hot\" option.  I was hoping it was spicy but, more it was more actually sweet in taste.  There were other interesting items on the meun, might come back to try it one day.  The price for the half fried chicken was about $17 + $2 for the hot option.  A bit pricey to me, $20 in total for half chicken with fries?  Hard to justify that.  The fries was actually not bad, it was nicely seasoned and cooked pretty good.  Thumbs up for that.  I have read other reviews and many have indicated that this was their signature dish (fried chicken) either with fries or with a waffel.  What can I say?  I think the fried chicken at Popeyes is pretty good.  Maybe is becasue of how I perfer salt over sweet.  Will I come back... hard to say.  Location is really out of the way and even though there were other interesting items on the menu, hard to make it back here."}
{"text":"The place is nice, good atmosphere, service however was not great. I took my old school love out to dined. I ordered appetizer and entrees and the server did not offer me the option of if the appetizers get served first or together with the entree. Upon ordering my drink, the server was not very friendly, in fact, she was very rushed in taking the order. Food is OK, I was referred to this place by a friend who claimed that this place has the \"best grilled cheese\", I would like to confirm that this statement is a myth (false). As for the grill cheese, the bread was way too think, and I would preferred it to be more toasted, as the cheese did not melt. In the conclusion, the place is good if you want to impress your sweetheart by taking her to a place that has good atmosphere and looks nice however, if you are a food lover... stay away... I will not be returning... peace."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner.  After contemplating the burger of the day which had picked beets and ranch dressing on it (among other things which I've forgotten) we settled on the shepherd's pie and the sloppy joe with mixed greens.  Both were tasty and comforting (which is what we were looking for).  As others have mentioned the portions are pretty big.    The interior is on the smaller side with cosy booths and a lot of natural light.  It's a nice place to sit and enjoy a meal and have a conversation with friends.  One thing that did surprise us is that for Saturday dinner the clients were exclusively families with young children.  We ended up sitting near the loudest screamer I've ever heard.  And he screamed continuously.  I think it was his art and his calling and he would not compromise on those points.  We laughed about it because we had already finished eating at that point.  I could see this really bothering other people though.  It would have bothered me if I had to deal with it for more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I was super excited to try all the delicious sugary brunch foods I saw on the website. But after my experience I will not be returning. Our main server was very curt with us, missed some orders and spilled boiling water on my lap blaming the \"over filled tea kettle\", the apology was nice but I wished she had run over a towel or some more napkins without having to be prompted. Our group was excited for the food but only my friend who order the beef bacon hash was satisfied. My other friend who ordered the sausages did not like them and found the little sausage medallions very rubbery. My French toast was very soupy, the bread had almost dissolved into the syrup before I could finish it. I had one soggy slice left over and the server said she would pack it up for me. But she never returned (which was fine by me). I think I would be willing to return if it was only a food issue (maybe the kitchen was having an off day - it happens to us all) but the server was so short with us and kept trying to take our plates while we were eating it has turned me off White Brick Kitchen. Oh well, on to the next sugary delicious brunch place :)"}
{"text":"DUde. Food was excellent. REALLY GOOD. Cesar was sooo tasty.. bacon was very yummy and crispy and smokey. The waitress was super friendly but not creepy. Sage sausage WOWOW and damn that was good arugula. Relaxed atmosphere - radio playing. Not too cool, not too lame. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a hungover brunch on a Sunday.  Somehow was convinced to wait more than half an hour for a table at the persistence of a friend's desire to come here. Have to say, it was worth the wait. Ordered the benedict with a side of bacon and it hit the spot.  Not as greasy or heavy as other eggs benedicts, which was perfect for a hangover breakfast.  My friends ordered the hot chocolate, which was absolutely delicious.  Another had the waffles, which were great if you like sweet things for breakfast.  I also eyed my biscuits and gravy, which he claimed was delicious but extremely heavy.  Would only recommend ordering it if you are able to food coma immediately afterwards."}
{"text":"White Brick Kitchen...I went there today with some friends for Breakfast. Its a decent spot, and rather cheap ($9 for 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes and salad). There's nothing toooo special about it. The food was good, I expected to get more, the portions look kind of small amongst the huge plates. It has great patio and their juice is freshly squeezed!....yeah it was a pleasant place, don't really know what else to say."}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food. Great spot even with 3 kids in tow! It's not a huge space and the exterior doesn't look completely inviting. I had been in favour of Korean for lunch but got outnumbered 4 to 1 when we parked and my husband spotted this joint. Well, I'm so glad we tried it. The pricing is reasonable, the space is clean, bright and inviting, and our server was sincerely patient and friendly with us. He was attentive, helpful with food suggestions and kept coming back to warm up our coffee. I'm sold."}
{"text":"I often visit little Korea to eat at Korean Village, always passing by and never noticing how fabulous this place is. Went here with some of my girlfriends for brunch on a Sunday a couple weeks ago.  Although we had to wait for about an hour, we didn't mind because we read reviews that it is often packed. It is a small restaurant but it's cozy. There's still enough leg room to enjoy a meal.   My girlfriends and I were in brunch bliss after taking our first bites into our meals. The service was fast and the waitress was efficient and knowledgable about the menu. They did run out of the \"scotch-ish\" eggs but we understood seeing that we did arrive pretty late for lunch (it was around 3 when we were seated). I still enjoyed my heavenly beef sausage sandwich. Since my girlfriends and I love to dine, we ordered the Strawberries n Cream waffles for dessert - also fantastic.  The prices were very reasonable (12 for the sandwich and 10 for the waffles). Definitely a delicious and great brunch place in the city. Can't wait to back to try something else."}
{"text":"I've had two great experiences with White Brick Kitchen so far, and hopefully many more. I've tried their fried chicken, tater tots, meatloaf, turkey club, chili fries, and the new curried vegan stew. All of it was very delicious. KFC across the road should be out of business with regards to the chicken. Tater tots, sort of like fried mashed potato balls, come heaped on a plate for appetizer. I try to stray away from ordering things I can make but the meatloaf was the best I've had of the dish (even better than my personal favorite, the Alton Brown Meatloaf). Turkey Club with sage butter was also flawlessly executed. The veggie stew was quite a bit like the bowls they serve at \"Fresh\", so I didn't find that especially noteworthy.   It's a real comfort food joint and I think it's the perfect place to take a \"meat and potatoes\" type of eater. Somehow the place is like empty every time I walk by, but I reaaaally hope they stay in business. As if I needed another reason to go back, they have a chicken and waffles special on Fridays now too."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and each time I've been there it never disappoints.  First visit I had the Scotch-ish Eggs!  They were amazing!  I especially loved the crispy panko fried soft-boiled eggs.  I'm usually an Eggs Benny kinda person for brunch - this was an amazing alternative.  Second visit I had their special which was a Duck Confit Quiche - loved this combination too.  Who would have ever thought to put duck confit in a q quiche!  Go early so that you are not stuck in a long line up!  Also my boyfriend loves their sage sausage! Hickory and Beef bacon were also good but he loves the sage sausage the best."}
{"text":"The coffee is good. Skip the house tater tots if you're craving actual tater tots. What we got with our order were these tiny cylinders of mashed potatoes with breaded and fried outer skin. They didn't taste horrible, but they weren't noteworthy. Plus I REALLY wanted real tater tots & was so disappointed.  The 4 Cheese Mac n' Cheese bowl is really good. The cheese is actually light, not thick & heavy like I expected it to be. The tomatoes really add to the dish. I tried some of the dishes my friends ordered. I didn't find the BBLT or the grilled cheese to be anything special, but I did like the thick bread (I feel like WBK needs to make french toast with their bread). Chicken & waffles dish was also just...good. I liked the waffle (no syrup, just a jam to accompany it) more than the chicken.  Overall, a nice place. Try their Caesar, it's a thinner bloody mary with a slice of bacon garnish. I'm thinking their brunch options might be better than their regular menu."}
{"text":"A modern and casual family-friendly joint in the heart of K-town definitely stood out amongst the slew of Korean BBQs and kimchi stew restaurants. As we came here for brunch, we just had to order the quintessentially chicken and waffles, which came in a very generous portion. The fried chicken was a little on the dry side but the chicken skin came with an excellent crunch, with a touch of sweetness to connect with the rich fluffy waffle which is typically eaten for dessert. For the real dessert course, we had a mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich to end a truly indulgent mommy's-comfort-food experience."}
{"text":"Love this place, and really hope they make it. Great service, great food, great value. The fried chicken, mac 'n cheese, BLT and sticky toffee pudding are outstanding. No downside."}
{"text":"I love this place. The music is unobtrusive, the service is SUPER friendly and accommodating, and the food is DELICIOUS. Grapefruit mimosas for everybody!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to WBK for a few years, and realized that we've not visited recently.  We decided, spontaneously and without a reservation, to go for dinner here on Friday night.  Alas, the restaurant was full and we didn't want to wait, so ended up ordering take-out.  One of our regular orders is their fried chicken.  Having tried lots of fried chicken around the city, we consider the fried chicken here to be one of the best.  While we've tried their \"hot\" version, we prefer their original (as it's less \"saucy\").  It's a generous serving, comes with a biscuit, and a side (we love their coleslaw!)  A newer item we'd not tried before is their double-down.  We decided to give this a try, even though we debated whether it was overkill to have both fried chicken AND a double-down (hey, it's a Friday night so we went all out).  Having KFC / Taco Bell across from them must give them some menu inspirations - they have the equivalent of \"fries supreme\", and now the double-down (although I'm not sure if KFC still has this since I don't do KFC.)  This is 2 pieces of boneless fried chicken topped with cheese / sriracha mayo, their home-made square bacon and an egg.  A nice touch is that as take-out, the sunny-side up egg is packed in a separate container.  Fantastically decadent!  The order came to $44 before tip, but this lasted us TWO meals each.  We've tried most of their menu items, with their mac and cheese being another favourite.  They also offer a lot of dessert options that are often nostalgic (i.e., lemon ice box pie) have a very \"home made\" feel.  The only suggestion I'd make is for them to offer more veggie/vegan options.  The only entree suitable for one of our friends is their curry - she says it's delicious.  That said, when we suggest going to WBK for dinner, this choice is sometimes veto'ed because she needs to be in the mood for this one entree that she can order!  We've also tried their brunches a few times.  The food again is excellent, but the wait times / lines deter us unless we go for a late brunch.  Having gone to this restaurant since they've opened, it's great to see a local business thrive and become popular and we will continue to support them."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  The White Brick Kitchen has never disappointed me. I love the coziness of it and all of the servers have been great!  For brunch, the Scotch-ish Eggs are AMAZING!  For dinner, their Vegan Country Captain is a delicious stew that can satisfy any belly (even a non-Vegan one) on a cold night. Their Shepard's Pie is also super yummy!  Definitely go here!!!"}
{"text":"White brick kitchen is our new local and w couldn't be happier about it! This place is great, brunch is phenomenal (they are so accommodating - want a fried egg on your grilled cheese? No problem!) AND open at 9am. We have been a few times now for dinner and my boyfriend swears they have the best burger in Toronto. I can't speak for the burger but the turkey stew and other dishes I have had have been consistently great. Good, affordable food, comfortable atmosphere, and friendly staff - you can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"My advice, go really early. I went there around 1:00, expecting a lovely selection of dishes to pick from their menu. When I finally placed my order with the waitress, all the dishes I wanted to try was sold out, so I had to settle for my 3rd pick. It was between the eggs Benedict or the classic breakfast. I choose just had the classic breakfast and there is nothing special in that. My food was alright but knowing I came all the way down from Markham was a piss off."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch restaurant in the city! The menu at White Brick Kitchen is constantly changing, making it a classic brunch staple. The restaurant is small and cozy, yet I have never had to wait long to be seated.   The first time I went to White Brick Kitchen I enjoyed their banana bread french toast. This dish consisted of chocolate chips, caramelized banana and Caramel. The french toast was made out of banana bread and it was to die for! This dish was the only sweet dish they had on the menu, as the menu is mainly made up of savoury dishes. My only wish for White Brick Kitchen is that they would add more sweet dishes to their menu.  When I went back to white brick kitchen a few months later, they updated their menu completely. This time I ordered their Scotch-ish Eggs. This dish consisted of Panko fried soft-boiled eggs placed in a sweet croissant layered with caramelized onion jam and hollandaise. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the mix of salty and sweet made for a very delicious dish.   White Brick Kitchen can get very busy, especially on the weekends, so my advice is to go earlier than later!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much how I came across WBK.  On a cold and rainy winter night, 2 hungry suburbanites were wandering the streets of Korea town desperately looking for something to eat that wasn't sushi or bibimbap.  All of a sudden after what seemed like hours... probably only 20 minutes or so a light emitted through the bleakness of winter.  White Brick Kitchen illuminated the dark street and provided us with an oasis of decadent comfort food. We were saved!  My boyfriend ate the mac and cheese and I hoovered down the turkey and biscuits.  I use the ever so ladylike term \"hoovered\" because that's what one does when they get a hot and tasty meal after walking in the rain.  The biscuits were so buttery and soft.  I savoured every bite.  The turkey bowl had huge chunks of turkey in a creamy stew.  The perfect remedy after coming in from the cold.  With delicious food, kind staff and a cute, intimate atmosphere, I'll be sure to come by again.   They had run out of their chicken dinner when I got there which was a little disappointing because it looked delicious.  I'll just have to come back for their chicken and waffles and brunch to make up for it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The rarebit is my favorite dish for brunch. Def gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with some friends today.  Unfortunately they don't serve their brunch menu on Saturdays but only on Sundays.  Regardless, we tried some of their breakfast-like food.    My friend and I shared the classic and the chicken and waffles.   1) The Classic - standard eggs, bacon and bread. We ordered their beef bacon which was nice and crispy but I felt they were quite salty.    2) Chicken and Waffles - Delicious.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! The waffle was soft and paired well with the chicken.  It came with some red pepper jelly which I didn't use too much of.    My other friend also got the Rarebit which was a Texas toast covered in some kind of cheesy sauce with an egg on top.  I had a bite of his and it was pretty tasty.   Overall, I liked white brick kitchen.  The staff were super friendly.  We actually were waiting for one of our friends for awhile and they didn't require us to wait outside until the whole party was there before we could be seated (unlike some other brunch places).  I'm not sure if it'll be like that when it's Sunday but on a Saturday we were able to wait for our friend with a seat! The prices were reasonable as well.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We were drawn to this place after seeing it on \"you gotta eat here\" and reading the great reviews posted.  .. Unfortunately for us, we didn't have the same experience as a lot of people posting on here. The food was JUST okay. Really didn't seem like anything that should be reviewed so highly! To be honest, we totally stopped valuing the input of \"you gotta eat here\" and stopped watching it after our visit!!   Seemingly from our trip I would say totally an over-rated place -- but maybe we just got the short end of the stick and it was an off day? Who knows.. The table we got seated at too was horrid - above some noisy fan near the back of the restaurant.. it was really hard to tolerate.   We thought'd we'd give this place another shot one day - but honestly haven't been back. There are so many places in the city that if someone lets you down -- you really don't need to bother to go back."}
{"text":"I started the night by ordering a Cesar, little did I know I was about the eat the best bacon in the world!!!  It's this crispy house made beef bacon, yum!!! We proceeded to order a plate of bacon for the table.  As a starter we ordered the tots with dill dip, amazing amazing amazing!!!  My friend and I decided to order two sandwiches and split, the BBLT and the sloppy joe, god we make good decisions!  We got the fries and cider slaw as sides, fries are spicy and home made!  We requested some dill dip and a side of housemade pickles, they were served happily with no extra charge.   We tried both desserts with a Lindt hot chocolate and wooooowwwww!!! Just the right amount of sweet.   My other friends ordered the fried chicken and another the meatloaf, I couldn't resist a bite and the portions were more than generous. All fantastic! The chicken was so crispy and so moist inside, not greasy and just flavourful.   I can go on and on about the food but my favourite thing about this place was the service, our server, Matt, was a gem. Prompt service, super friendly and kept the drinks pouring!! He even put a candle in our dessert for my friends bday, what a sweetie.  Last but not least - the bathrooms are clean!!!!!!!!!! And in a basement, the ultimate judge of any Toronto restaurant, they passed with flying colours!   Seriously, come here.   They are closed for renovations March 3 - 16, go quick!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for brunch on a Saturday and was treated warmly by the staff. Ordered the breakfast plate and chicken and waffles. Would skip the \"make it hot option\" doesn't add anything to the already great chicken. Juicy and flavourful on the inside, and very crispy on the outside. Waffle and its accompanying sweet and spicy syrup were so good that I ate more than my share. Breakfast was solid, potatoes cooked well and sage sausage patties reminiscent of Stockyards style. You can probably expect a wait here unless you get lucky like us, since this spot looks like it serves about 30 people max."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles. The serving was huge. It's enough for two people so perfect for sharing. The waffles were made from scratch and were the best waffles I have ever had. The chicken was perfectly done and the service was very quick and the servers were friendly. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I am a big fan of the fried chicken here. The portions are generous. It always boggles me that this places is not more popular...."}
{"text":"Such a great place! The food is delicious and the price is perfect. The portions were enormous and despite the great tastes and sitting at a table of 10, it was near impossible to finish everyone. The fried chicken was the definite star of the table but the burger of the day was pretty incredible too. While the interior of this place might leave something to be desired, the patio is great. This restaurant is by far, my favourite place in Little Korea."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken place I've been. The only disappointment is that they had great root beer float there but was taken down from the menu a while ago.."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but I won't be going back for Brunch because of the insane wait! And I am used to waiting for good food.  We were told it would be 30 minutes. After an hour and a half of waiting outside we checked to see where we were on the list and she said we were next. As the next table for 4 cleared up, the hostess gave it away to a couple and when we asked she laughed and said she just made a mistake. We were so upset and she barely apologized. She also had told us she'd bring us a biscuit about 45 minutes into our wait then just completely forgot.   They gave us a free biscuit when we finally sat down but so little respect for people that wait just isn't worth it. There are great brunch spots in Toronto where they turn tables over much faster and would never give away tables without checking who was next."}
{"text":"Best Sheppards pie  Love the homemade bacon on their ceasers too  Wife has the lemonade and Sheppards I love the club sandwich  Is a must try"}
{"text":"Have eaten at the White Brick Kitchen now twice, and certainly not by accident.  I looked up places in Koreatown and the ratings for WBK were high, so I decided to give it a go. Boy, I am glad I did.  I had the fried chicken with cider slaw. Honestly could probably be the best fried chicken I have ever had. You would think once you had good fried chicken you'd had it all. This place sets the bar higher. Just cooked perfectly, not much else to say. Try it for yourself. Their home made kettle chips also amazing. (co worker ordered those)  The second time I went back I ordered something I wouldn't normally order, got the Mac 'n Cheese and paid the extra 2 bucks to have bacon thrown in, which they apparently make themselves as well. It was excellent. The food is so good here I made sure to have the waiter tell the chef that I loved coming to eat there, and thanked them for making such great wholesome food.  If you are even remotely close to this place, please give it a try, you will not be disappointed. A true gem."}
{"text":"Great brisket burger!  Be sure to get the fried cheddar on top. Their beer bacon Caesar was also fantastic. I would definitely go back.  My only disappointment was that they don't have an espresso machine. Other than that, I enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"Visited White Brick Kitchen twice, once in 2013 for Sunday brunch, once recently for Saturday lunch. Good food, reasonable prices, and warm service that suffers only occasional bouts of slowness. It does have long waits for larger tables and may not be able to accommodate groups of six or more.  Food both times was good and reasonably priced, but the chicken and waffles ($16) I had recently was top-notch.  Well-seasoned and crisp-skinned chicken, the dark meat was juicy (white was a bit dry), and the waffle was fluffy and light. It's also a huge amount of food and I was positively stuffed. Only negative is that the red pepper jelly included isn't the best accompaniment. You can get maple syrup for $1 or table syrup, Franks Red Hot, or Sriracha for free. The maple syrup is also very maple-y -- definitely No. 2 or No. 3, none of that No. 1 nonsense. Both chicken and waffles are good and as a whole, WBK has better chicken and waffles than Harlem and Stockyards.  Service is warm, well-meaning, and friendly for Toronto standards (i.e., you actually get a smile!) Does get slow at times and I've had to ask for refills of water or coffee occasionally.  Would absolutely go again, but maybe only with no more than three dining companions so the wait wouldn't be as long."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a party of 4. First time visiting White Brick. 3 of us ordered the vegan curry - delicious and generous bowl, and one got the burger. Service was good though a little slow. We were never offered coffee refills which was odd, though we never asked for more.  Most menu items are on the heavier side but you can certainly make some lighter fare substitutions."}
{"text":"I came here for one thing and one thing only, fried chicken.  Man let me tell you, it was awesome!  At 5:30 PM, we were the only two customers at the restaurant.  The server was super friendly and attentive.  He suggested a couple of his favorite side dishes to go with the fried chicken, Cider Slaw and Chili Garlic Broccoli.    Around 5:45 PM, we could hear the sizzling sound of frying chicken.  We knew that it was going to be good.  About 6:00 PM, behold ... perfectly fried chicken.  Golden brown crust.  Crunchy.  It stayed crunchy until the last bite.  Juicy on the inside.  Not oily.  With the right amount of buttermilk batter.  It was so good, I picked the bones clean.  I also enjoyed the two side dishes.  The Cider Slaw had the right amount of acidity which contrast the chicken beautifully.  Chili Garlic Broccoli was also a hit.  It was garlicky with a kick.  Drenching with butter, it went down smoothly with the fried chicken. I would order this again.  The scallion biscuits were divine!  We definitely will return for more crunchy goodness.  One more thing, come hungry and clean your plate it is a large serving sure to satisfy."}
{"text":"They have BEEF BACON...I rest my case! The restaurant is on the small side so if you have a large group you may have to wait a bit. The service is great and the staff are nice.  The food was great and well made  I had the classic breakfast 2 eggs poached hard perfectly and crispy beef bacon and delicious toast! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Everything was great here. I had the 1/2 fried chicken with coleslaw and tried the shepperd's pie. All was delicious. They serve a variety of fancy cocktails with umbrellas and the restaurant is mostly booths, so very comfy. Our server was lovely."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go for brunch on a Saturday! Their buttermilk fried chicken is worth the 20 minute wait. I've tried their fried chicken on waffles with red pepper jelly (which is to die for) and their buttermilk fried chicken main with scallion biscuits. Personally, I thought their biscuits were absolutely amazing, savoury and delicious, and I would order it with a side of the red jelly since it compliments the chicken so well! If you like super crispy and satisfying fried chicken, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Firstly I should say I've been here before and the food is good.   However on our last visit we were disappointed as we waited to be seated for almost 10 minutes - not normally a problem, I'm happy to wait for good food -  but we were not acknowledged by a single staff member for the whole duration of this wait, not even a hello.   We were not the only people in line and there seemed to be a lot of staff members standing around. There were also empty tables.  After being ignored for almost 10 minutes we decided it was best to leave.  Not sure what the problem was but it was a pretty terrible experience, especially for 2 hungry people!"}
{"text":"I've walked by White Brick Kitchen many times and have heard many good things about it so I was determined to try it out.  I finally came here for brunch (actually late lunch) last Saturday with my hubby and son. The restaurant is small and cozy - felt like very initimate which I liked. We wre seated immidiately which I liked. The services was friendly and prompt but not overly intrusive. I ordered the mac and cheese which I shared with my son and my husband ordered the chicken and waffle.  The mac and cheese was really tasty - there was a lot of cheesy goodness in the dish. My son loved it.  My husband's chicken and waffle looked amazing when it came out. I was jealous and wished I had order that instead. He shared some with me and it was out of this world!  I am definitely coming back and getting that!  The portions were generous as well which makes this pretty good value.  Overall we had an awesome brunch experiences and and we willbe back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant, unfortunately Yelp doesn't allow half star ratings. I feel four would be to generous, therefore a 3.5 would be accurate.  Food: Is good. We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, salad greens and a bowl of chilli. No complaints there. There is a heavy after-feeling though (stomach wise). Pricing is reasonable. Menu is small, not alot of options.  Ambience: A bit underwhelming. They're going for an urban diner-esque type of decor, what with the signs they have up and type of music playing.  Layout: The kitchen is too close to the dining area and open. The smell of food from the kitchen easily seeps int the dining area (lack of proper ventilation). Only plus here is that all the tables are booths. Booths are always a plus for me.  Staff: Nice and friendly. However, our server didn't pass by during or after our meal to ask how our meal went (or was going).   Would visit again but only if Im in the area again (which isn't that often)."}
{"text":"Comfort food done right and at its best. I came here with a group of six on friday feb 21st for dinner. Our server Michelle was very pleasant and willing to help us out with choices and drinks were yummy right off the bat.  It was my wifey's bday and we were heading out after to drink so we wanted to do something light. We opted for the mac n cheese as we both LOVE it. They were so nice as to seperate it into two nice sized bowls with a piece of garlic loaf each. WOW!!!!!!!! I cannot overstate how freaking awesome the food was! Creamy with just the right hint of different cheeses, The pasta was cooked el dente and was spiral perfection. We also had the deviled eggs which were amazing. Everyone loved their choice. As we are a sharing group of friends I also had the tatter tots which left me speechless on how the right amount of crunch was combined with potatoey goodness. Sheppards pie was also super fab. We will be coming here again and again as the service was stellar, the food was out of this world great and the prices cannot be beat. with 8 drinks, mac n cheese and deviled eggs the bill was only $55!!! They are getting a renovation and I can't wait to make a reservation for a large party at this amazing hidden gem in K-town."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite family owned restaurants. The workers are great and very polite. My girlfriend and I travel from Vaughan and Mississauga to Koreatown every few months to visit this little gem of a restaurant. The buttermilk Chicken is definitely worth the drive down. I haven't tried the Sunday Brunch yet and that's definitely going to happen sooner or later. Keep it up friends!"}
{"text":"Buttermilk Fried Half Chicken was da bomb dot com! Choice of one side. Was going to get the fries but opted for the cider slaw. It was nice and purple but I realize I'm not a coleslaw person after all. The chicken was ah-mazing... the skin was crispy and herbed well. The chicken was white and well cooked. Not dry at all. Oh man, I could eat it all over again. Interestingly, it wasn't greasy like KFC. It was neat and clean. Also came with garlic biscuits which weren't bad either, but I was so full I couldn't finish it. We also ordered beer by Lake of Bays Brewing Company (Spark House Red Ale and Rock Cut Baysville Lager). Perfect combination.  Service was delightful. All the hostesses seem to have blue eyes and are super cheery and happy to be serving up plates of heart attack. Wouldn't have it any other way."}
{"text":"would have gotten the extra star had the lemonade not tasted like kool-aid =(   i came here for brunch on a sunday. my friend and i got there around 12:30 and unfortunately the brunch special was already sold out. i settled for the grilled cheese - but it was still delicious! it came with a tomato pesto almost in the middle and it was very flavourful and perfectly crispy on the outside. my friend got eggs benedict and she really liked her meal too.   the pink lemonade was SO PINK it looked like it was radioactive. do not get the lemonade!"}
{"text":"This little brunch spot in Korea town surprised me!  We showed up around 1pm and there was a line up as expected. It was moving though and we didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes.  They were out of grapefruit juice but they made sure my coffee cup was never empty.  The Scotch-ish Eggs ($9) turned out to be an awesome choice.  I like Scotch eggs as a bar snack but for breakfast?  They were perfectly panko breaded and crispy and warm and runny on the inside.  I asked for more greens (instead of home fries) and multigrain toast instead of a baguette.  They were super nice and brought me exactly what I wanted.  I saw that they have Fried Chicken and Waffles on certain days. I gotta come back for fried chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch place in the area. Everything was great, from atmosphere, service and food. Blueberry waffle was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner literally by chance; was openly discussing where to have dinner with my partner on a cold winter night and a rando guy standing behind us at the bank machine suggested White Brick Kitchen.  He suggested that the warm comfort food would be perfect; moreover, they serve the Best Fried Chicken, and the neon sign on their window with that headline served as testament.   He was right, it was perfect for a cold night and empty bellies.  We split a half fried chicken with house-made BBQ kettle chips on the side, plus the daily special of sheppard's pie (technically a cottage pie - *snoofle, snoofle *the sound of a snob, I imagine).  The chicken was a rather large plate, and it probably could've fed us both.  That said, \"the Best Fried Chicken\" is a pretty big claim to make, though the buttermilk-soaked chicken was pretty crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.    The sheppard's pie was standard, covered by a layer of buttermilk mashed potatoes, but between the pie and the chicken, I'd go for the chicken over the pie.    Thanks for the rec, rando suggestion guy!  Is this what life was like before Yelp?"}
{"text":"When I think \"Chicken & Waffles\", this is exactly what I'm talking about. So freaking good!   I ordered a pound of chicken tenders, waffles and fries... The portions were way bigger than expected but my goodness is that chicken good. It's tender, juicy, perfectly breaded and mouth watering *Drool Emoji*. The fries were also excellent (fresh cut).  Service was great. We came in 15 mins before closing on a Sunday and no one rushed us at all. I will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is sooo good. We loved their bacon Caesars. The shepherds pie was pretty good but if I got to choose again, would have gotten the chicken with the hubby instead of the pie. Will be back to try more items. The biscuits were nice."}
{"text":"Decent chicken & waffles, but AMAZING fried chicken!   I came here on a Saturday with friends and the wait was about 30 mins for a table for 3. I ordered the classic Chicken and Waffles with the 4 piece bone-in chicken. The portions here are definitely generous and will fill you up - come here on an empty stomach! BE WARNED, the chicken and waffles come with NO sauce (which I have never experienced before) and they charge $2 for maple syrup or any other sauce. The fried chicken here is really juicy and tender, and the waffles are fluffy. However, the lack of sauce disappointed me and would have made the dish bland. I tried my friend's WBK Fried Chicken Sandwich and it was so delicious! The sauces and lettuce in the sandwich does a good job complementing the fried chicken. The cucumber salad was also a nice side for this dish.    The restaurant itself is just typical in décor, as the fried chicken is what people come for. The service was efficient and attentive!   I definitely want to return for the WBK Fried Chicken Sandwich and to try the poutine.   Note: They only have Sunday brunch, with a few other breakfast options and chicken & waffles for weekdays. They also don't take resos, but they will take your name and number down when you show up and call you when there's a table!"}
{"text":"I've had White Brick bookmarked for a very long time but I don't like lining up especially for brunch. Finally got the chance to visit and boy was I missing out! The BF and I were up early on a Saturday so we headed down to White Brick. We wandered K-town before they opened and there was no line up... Yey! But they did fill up really fast.  He got the Sage Sausage breakfast ($9) with eggs and toast. He enjoyed the food but thought the eggs were heavy on the pepper. I really liked the unique flavor of the sage sausage. Always wanted to try their Chicken and waffles ($16) and I was not disappointed At All! I love pepper so the seasoning was perfect. Chicken was crispy and juicy, the pickled carrot strings had the right tang, the waffle was fluffy and the little dab of chili jelly added just the right amount of heat. The order was huge so it's perfect for sharing.  The place is tiny and fills up quick but staff is friendly and very attentive. It's pricey if you're looking for basic breakfast but the Chicken and Waffles more than made up for it.  White Brick was so good my bf reminded me to write a review. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken. The sweet chili sauce is to die for. If you come here between 11am - 1pm on the weekends, expect to wait at least an hour.  Can't say much about the rest of the menu, but will be back to try them soon."}
{"text":"Brunch here was excellent and the service was outstanding.  If there was anything unpleasant it was just that the wait was a bit long. It really annoys me when people are done eating, knowing there is a long line, and hangs around an hour more just chatting.  During these times you wish you were eating at a chinese restaurant where they really try to kick you out when your done.  When I see a line and I'm done, I just get out.  doesnt change the fact the WBK is an awesome establishment and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Such a cozy place for comfort food. We really enjoyed every dish we ordered. Service is a little slower than other restaurants but it's because they make everything fresh so it is well worth the wait.   Got the chicken with hot sauce. Such a great kick. Loved the Mac n Cheese - super cheesy and strong cheesy goodness. The sloppy joe had such good beef flavours and paired amazingly with the beets coleslaw.   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had a great Sunday brunch here.  It's a place in the Annex area where it's outside bricks are not surprisingly painted white.  The place has a nice vibe to it and a decent sized outdoor patio to sit at.  Arriving at noon, we had to wait 20 mins before getting a table for two (make sure you cut to the front to put your name on the list instead of just standing at the back).  We ordered the Eggs Benny and the Banana Bread French Toast, which is becoming my standard brunch order these days just so I can compare with different places.    The Eggs Benny was pretty good, the hollandaise sauce was tasty, but there was not enough of it.  The sausage was a bit on the dry side, but I think it had to do more with the type of sausage itself and not the preparation of it.  The banana bread french toast was a delight.  It is without a doubt more on the sweet side, with it's ample maple syrup poured over the banana bread.  But the mix of chocolate, banana and syrup was sublime.  The coffee and ice tea here was also good.  Overall, a great place to try for brunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch with always new things on the menu.  Fried chicken is one of Toronto's best for dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I visited the White Brick Kitchen on our recent trip to Canada and it was a wonderful experience.  The menu is small, which is usually a good sign and each simple dish is put together perfectly.  We had the Fried Chicken (hot) and it was spectacular!  The chicken is properly cooked with a crunchy skin enveloping the moist and flavorful meat inside.  We had the HOT sauce brought on the side so we could try the chicken in it's natural form as well as with the hot sauce.  The sauce really adds to the dish with it's not too spicy notes and a hint of sweetness that I found reminiscent of a Thai Chili sauce.        We also ordered the burger,  made with brisket that hasn't been over handled, with cheddar cheese.  They have a simple yet genius way of adding the cheese to this burger.  It appears that the cheese is too large for the burger which allows the cheddar surrounding the burger to hit the flat top and become crispy.  There's quite a bit of it and the cooked crisp cheese really adds another level of flavor and texture to the burger.  I have had very few burgers as good as this one.        The Mac and Cheese is really wonderful too.  4 cheeses blended together over perfectly cooked pasta highlighted by oven dried tomatoes that serve to brighten up the dish and finished with breadcrumbs.  The cheese sauce held up so well that it never broke apart even after it had cooled.        The White Brick Kitchen must be listed as a do not miss on your next trip to Toronto.  The kitchen is skilled and unpretentious and are able to elevate simple dishes to something special."}
{"text":"For a place in the annex, they should offer more vegetarian options and at least one vegan option for brunch."}
{"text":"Wow you guys, This place is the best of the best!   I have walked by here sooooo many times on my way home and every time I always think to my self \" hm gotta try that place sometime!\". Well friends I finally have and I am getting some mixed feeling about this place. Only because It is SO close to my house and I have to try and stop myself from eating here every day. It's that good. I almost wish it was further so I wouldn't be so tempted!   Anyways I took my boyfriend here for his birthday lunch the other day. He got the burger of the day which was a mozzarella burger that looked and smelt so amazing. I got the club sandwich and honestly I'm not 100% what was all on it but I think magic was one of the ingredients. Yum! The price was totally worth it ($40 ish), usually I'd spend a bit less for lunch but it was a special occasion so why not!  Also staff was A+! Super friendly and accommodating.  I for sure will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Passing by with my son and stopping by to try the fried chicken, was really good, coming from the Caribbean I will give this fried chicken a check mark.. and also a good price."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken ever! Extra Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside! Nomnomnomnom! Absolutely finger licking good!  Sloppy joe sandwich was the bomb as well! Service is great! Fast and friendly. The only thing I didn't like about my order was my \"freshly squeezed orange juice\". It tasted so much like tropicana :( But I'm definitely coming back and try their brunch, I'll just have to keep in mind not to order their juices."}
{"text":"Won't get a chance to eat here I guess, the staff are so uppity we've been turned away 2x because they're too cool for school I guess. I don't know if they were tired from a busy day but there was 0 effort to extend any kind of normal courtesies like they looked at us and thought we didn't belong. We live just down the street from here."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on food network I had to visit this place when I had the chance! We came for an early lunch on a weekday so unfortunately my appetite wasn't quite ready to take on their famous fried chicken so early in the day. But i vow to return for dinner when I get the chance!  For lunch I was debating between the blueberry hotcakes and the sloppy joe. Since my friend ordered the hotcakes I ordered the sloppy joe and stole a few bites of hers. I must say, both of those were fantastic! I was super happy to visit a tv recommended restaurant and have them actually live up to the hype!  First, the sloppy joe. Had to use a knife and fork for this cause they were super generous with the sloppy part of the sloppy joe and it was physically impossible to eat this with my hands in sandwich format. I recommend getting this with the salad (what I did) rather than the home fries. Since the sloppy joe is so rich and flavourful, the added carbs would have been a bit too much. The light salad with a tangy vinaigrette was the perfect complement to the rich and savoury sloppy joe.  The hotcakes was also perfection. They were super generous with the blueberries used in the blueberry sauce and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Hotcakes were perfectly fluffy and the fresh whipped cream was the perfect way to top it all off. I may even suggest leaving the syrup off. In my opinion the blueberry sauce and whip cream alone were perfect. Syrup may make it too sweet.  Definitely will return to try dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Food is just delicious. Great service and great location. I know people complain about waiting in line to get in, but I don't see why that would affect the restaurants rating. Just be sure to come in on an empty stomach. Portions are big and prices are very fare."}
{"text":"Average to good for a casual eats restaurant. Offers indoor and outdoor seating with a casual feel. Service was friendly and not overbearing. The wait for food was average but it came hot and fresh. Portion size is generous and there are vegetarian options and a vegan option. Price is fair at $15-20 per entree."}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place on instagram so I decided to take my boyfriend here. We travelled from Mississauga. I ordered the original chicken tenders and waffles with a side of gravy. It was good, but I think the gravy could have been better. I think they add the spicy seasoning to it, something seemed off. My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken with a poutine on the side.   BEWARE: if you like spicy food, this might be the time you order original over spicy. Their version of spicy chicken seems to be basically drenching fried chicken in a bath of dry Cajun spices. My boyfriend loves spicy food, but could not finish one piece of chicken. The dry seasoning was too overwhelming. There was fine print on the menu advising it was really spicy, but I wish it would've said it was a dry spice. Because my boyfriend couldn't eat his meal, it ruined the whole meal for both of us.   It was quite expensive for the two meals and one beer.. around $50-60! I probably would not come back unless they lower prices and I'm in that area craving normal fried chicken.."}
{"text":"Love love love it!!!! I feel like I had breakfast in a house w a white picket fence. Great decor. It's such a cozy place I absolutely had a great time. The mimosa was only 5 bucks and breakfast combo 10 for huge portion of eggs sausage and potatoes. Service was very chill and friendly. They have the nice side patio which is great to sit at on warm days. Great bang for your buck.. Does not disappoint"}
{"text":"It's fine. But microwave bacon and only white bread? I figure if you're only going to have 3 options for brunch, make them worth it.   Eggs were cooked well which was nice. Wait staff was sweet."}
{"text":"Unexpected greatness.  So we had business to attend to in the area, and I had heard they replaced the Eggsmart with a pretty decent dinner place.  I also knew they served brunch (from 9-4!), and it was 12:30, so I figured we'd walk by and see how crazy it is.  Because we all know that brunch places on a Sunday in Toronto can have line-ups out the door, even the not-so-good places.  All the pros: - no line-up.  Lots of seats. - had a Starbucks coffee in my hand. Asked if I should throw it out; server said of course not, keep it.  Big points. - Quick, efficient, friendly, amazing service from our Ryan Philippe-look-alike server.   - I ordered two dishes because I'm a glutton.  I had the grilled cheese - perfect bread, toasted perfect, three cheeses, perfect size.  I also had the chocolate banana bread french toast - with caramel sauce all over the place.  Served piping hot.  This was like the best thing ever, and I'm really not a sweet-brunch person.  I usually prefer savoury dishes. - grapefruit mimosas or orange. Grapefruit went well for brunch. - nice bathrooms - great pricing - each dish $10-14.    All the cons: - not next door to where I live  Will be back to try the dinner, but will for sure be back for many brunches."}
{"text":"Straight up five stars, four for the food, one extra for the customer service.  I've had White Brick Kitchen on my list for a while because of their fried chicken and I was not disappointed one bit.  My friend and I ordered the 1/2 fried chicken with their housemade BBQ chips and hot sauce on the side, and the vegan country captain. When we told our server we were sharing she asked us if we wanted the chicken served on two separate dishes. When it arrived I noticed they'd given us an extra portion of the chips and the biscuit. Very thoughtful of them! The best part of the meal though was the Vegan stew because it was delicious and I never expected it to be that good. The half fried chicken was $18, and the vegan country captain was $14.5. They also make their own hot sauce and it's delicious. It's a good balance of sweet and spicy so if you have the chance to add it to your meal, do it!"}
{"text":"There really is no shortage of eateries at Bloor and Bathurst. Unfortunately, 2 of my dining companions are the pickiest of eaters, and after being waitlisted by Snakes and Lattes for a couple of hours, we looked for something to accommodate their inexperienced food needs. White Brick is barely noticeable amongst so many other places, but we decided on them.  The menu is very small (it has more items on Sundays), and the picky twins settled on the sausage chilli cheese fries and the brisket burger, and my girl picked the country fried steak. I chose the mac and cheese.  Holy flavorpocalypse! I know these aren't the most elaborate dishes, but it's very evident that WBK puts a ton of effort into their dishes, and they were all delicious. The mac and cheese's sauce was amazing, and I couldn't get enough. I also loved the garlic toast being included. I also sampled the country fried steak, and it was perfection. Even the picksters loved their food, which is no easy feat. Their kettle corn chips served as a side are terrific too. Bonus charm points for serving coke in the old-school bottles.   The service was also ace. Granted we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time, but our waitress was very kind and attentive, without being overbearing due to the place being quiet.  I really hope this place makes it, because I can't wait to return! Well done, WBK!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them 4 starts.  That's always the goal.  But I just can't.  I recognize that they are super busy on Sunday mornings, but they seemed in no hurry to get us out the door.  But I digress ...  The positives:  -The wait was acceptable, no more than 30 minutes. -They call you when your table is about to be ready, so no need to wait there, you're welcome to go grab coffee or walk on Bloor. -The menu is simple and provides basic choices without overwhelming you. -The atmosphere is nice, and the chairs are comfy, not too cramped. -Poutine was good.  Like really good.  It's one redeeming quality!  The negatives: -The chicken and waffles is generic, with no creativity.  It's literally a waffle and chicken strips. -The breakfast sandwich was bland, and was missing that punch of flavor I was hoping for at the price. -The service was poor.  We never got refills for our water, and we waited for nearly 10 minutes after they cleared our table to bring our bill.  Once they brought the bill, we waited another 10 minutes to get them to bring the portable credit card reader so we could free up the table for someone else waiting.  Overall it's not a terrible place to go, we just felt that it's was sub par.    Side note - the food looks good at least!"}
{"text":"Great food, we've loved everything.  My girlfriend keeps going back to the mac & cheese (with bacon!), I flip around between the chicken and the sandwich of the day."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of WBK. Superficially, it may not seem like the most exciting kid on the block, but this has turned into one of our favourite chilled brunch/lunch spots in the hood. Very relaxing vibe, nice staff, good value (large portion sizes) and tasty too. What is the secret to their delicious potatoes served at brunch?   The closest I've come to having a non-breakfast/brunch meal there was a burger served with their coleslaw. I give it two thumbs up-- I liked the Italian-type sauce on the burger. I'll have to check out their dinner one of these days."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Happened to go here last week coz Fanny chadwicks was closed  due to flooding. Im glad we did! The chicken and waffles with the sauce was to die for and so was the Joes fries. Omg my mouth is watering thinking about it. The chicken and waffles was a generous portion for the price and I ended up taking it home, its good to share which is what I did with a friend. Service was awesome loved everything about the place. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great eggs. Made right when you order. It feels like they are using free run eggs which taste much better than regular eggs. Sadly bruch is ONLY on sundays. You can check their menu on their website"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place and it totally fell flat.  I ordered the grilled cheese and although it was good, it was like another reviewer described it: a giant loaf of bread with a hunk of cheese on it.  The hash browns were eh, and I thought for some reason the grilled cheese had tomato on it but it just came with this ketchup-like salsa on the side.  My friend said her meal  was good but not great (she had the hash) but it looked really unappetizing.  Definitely not a win for me."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch is so delicious. During the summer there's a great little patio, though that makes for long lines. In the winter this place isn't that crowded, though.   The food comes pretty quick, it's good portions and really reasonable, average prices for brunch.   They also have lunch and dinner but I haven't tried them, but I've seen people eat the fried chicken and the portions are enormous.   It's a great place and one of my favourite (and most reliable) brunch places in the hood."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill unfortunately.  They used to have the best fried chicken, but last time I went, and tonight, they seem to have changed the recipe.  Less flavourful, and the skin just wasn't the same.  It used to be absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"I can't express how delicious the food was. Best chicken and waffle I've had so far . The poutine was on point ! It's a must try !!  the service was amazing. Thank you for a great first time experience!"}
{"text":"It's a small place so be prepared to wait. Food was delicious, we had the fried chicken benny and the grilled cheese. We just missed out on the Sunday special but we will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Located in Koreatown, White Brick Kitchen does not stick out that much (as I've walked by it so many times without realizing it ever existed). I got the Classic where you can pick 4 which is available Tuesday through Saturdays from 11AM to 4PM. I chose 2 eggs (sunny side up), sausage, white toast (with butter), and fries all for $11.25 before tax which is a sweet deal. The servers were super good, refilling our drinks consistently and checking up on our meal. And the food was super delicious! Only issue was I found a small hair in my fries, however because I have worked in the food industry I know mistakes happen and a small hair isn't a big deal. I will definitely return any time I'm feeling a quick brunch meal!"}
{"text":"Stubbled onto this place while is K-town. What is a place like this in K-town? But I have been noticing that it's becoming more and more multicultural. Gotta love this city!  We were lucky to get some seating because this place was hopping. Didn't have to wait too long and the hostess were attentive and prompt.   I read through the menu and I got excited. I already started to plan what I was going to have the next time I come back to this place.  I ordered the buttermilk half fried chicken with fries and homemade lemonade iced tea and the wife had mushroom melt french toast with home fries. The lemonade iced tea was refreshing and really good which made me excited again. Maybe too excited to wait but a-waiting we did. The food took some time to come out and can tell why the place was so busy.  When it finally came out, it looked spectacular. Normally I try to eat healthy and a rule is to have some colour in a dish. Maybe some veggies or salad on the side. This was all brown and I was liking it. Overall the food was cooked well. The seasoning (salt and pepper) was too much for me. It was like eating a bag of chips and I needed a gallon if water to get that salty taste out of my mouth. It was the same for my wife's dish.  I'll probably come back to try something else but I'm not going cancel any appointments in my schedule to come here."}
{"text":"Modest diner vibe, excellent fried chicken (crispy and moist), and ok meatloaf. But the highlight for my dinner companions was definitely the delicious little dessert item called \"cutie pies.\" Like sweet little empanadas. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"White Brick Kitchen is located on the south west corner of Euclid and Bloor West between Christie and Bathurst stations on the Bloor subway line.  Toronto has their fair share of places where people are willing to line up and wait for brunch on the weekend and don't take reservations because really, they don't have to.  WBK is one of those places.  On a very cold Sunday I arrived around 10:40ish to see that there were 3 groups of 3 or more in front of me.  A person came in looking for a table of two and was seated immediately.  All of the seating in this place is only 2 or 4 seat tables.  There was one table at the front window that can seat 5.  Upon check in I was given the choice of leaving my number for my place in line or just to wait there.  The place and the list is simply written down at the front counter.  Anybody can see it.  That's how I knew how many were ahead of me and I was given the option to leave my number so I could leave and come back but since it was so cold outside, no - I wasn't going to take a stroll to Christie Pits.  It became crowded pretty fast.  They have a curtain at the doorway leading to the entrance so it sort of helps keep the heat in when the cold wanted to creep in.  It became awkward however when more people started to show up and line up inside because it was cramped.  Understandingly so nobody wants to be outside when it was this cold on a day like that.  Still, the staff here are great, friendly and accommodating.  Anybody observing to can how challenging it is to move around in this space and when there's people waiting sort of impeding the way to tables it makes the degree of difficulty even more.  The food is the reason people are lined up and coming in however.  Brunch is not something that is taken lightly.  You can get breakfast anywhere really but weekend mornings are a bit different.  Brunch = drinks (alcohol) served strictly after 11am.  I watched while waiting in line as beer was being poured and had to sit there until the big hand hit the 12 and it became 11am.  Now it's legal!  So between beer, mimosas and Caesars, I ended up getting the large Caesar which they make with 2oz of Stoli and rim the glass with steak spice instead of celery salt which is a nice change actually.  The Caesar wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it had a good taste, mild but the steak spice rim was more like a salt and pepper type season rather than a hot pepper overall tang.  Still good, just different.  Just a pickle on top, nothing wacky or different, just standard.  I ended up ordering the 8 piece chicken (tenders) and waffles with a side of bacon and real maple syrup.  I would have preferred real pieces of fried chicken but it isn't offered for breakfast.  The chicken was battered, seasoned but nothing standout-ish.  I mean the chicken seemed just plain Jane standard, not spicy and sort of bland.  It was good but just good.  It wasn't as risky as say the Stockyard's offering.  My friend had asked for some hot sauce and I thought they'd bring a bottle but it was a tiny paper cup with maybe 5ml in it.  He didn't use it all and I used some of it to spark up my chicken just a tad.  I was sort of disappointed I had to ask for and pay for maple syrup (2 bucks).  I mean this is chicken and waffles and we're in Canada.  I'm not really interested in Aunt Jemima's or some sort of maple syrup alternative.  Not to mention this dish is almost 20 bucks.  As for the side of bacon the pieces weren't measly small greasy diner type bacon but it was only 2 slices and it was 4 bucks.  Emma's I believe uses Sanagan's meat at least for the pepperette they do.  The waffle was good and light but it was sort of small, maybe 6 inches in diameter?  It wasn't very thick either.  Overall the service is really good at WBK.  The chicken and waffles I have to say for me was mediocre.  While the chicken (8 tenders around 4 inches long each) was decently abundant it didn't wow me.  I need to be wowed because I'm sort of a lover of fried chicken.  The waffle while good was lacking in overall quantity.  There was no butter offered and the maple syrup had to be paid for which is sort of a turn off.  I suppose I could have asked for butter but I didn't necessarily need it.  I would have used it if it came.  I can't say that I've ever paid 2 dollars for a slice of bacon (x 2) ever and the Caesar while tasty wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for or expecting.  WBK is a good place.  I've had others tell me tales of how good this or that is, mainly the chicken.  While I didn't have a chance to get bone in chicken pieces these tenders that came with the chicken and waffles for me were just meh.  Overall I can't say I was too impressed with this place but then again I've only had one sit down there.  For a place that's known for their fried chicken and it seems to be talked about a lot - honestly I just don't see it."}
{"text":"What a great brunch.  I had the \"scotch-ish\" eggs, and they were amazing.  Cooked perfectly.  I also had the caesar to drink, which was very tasty and garnished with beef bacon.  Really??  Bacon as a garnish...what an amazing idea.  Service was good, very attentive.  We did have to wait about twenty minutes as we went around 11am, but it was definitely worth the wait.  Can't wait to come back to Toronto and eat here again."}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice now. Right in Koreatown, white brick is a hidden gem. I stumbled upon this place originally on Instagram and what caught my eye was the uhhhh-MAZING Joe fries! Sloppy joe meat with fresh cut fries topped with a fried egg and drizzled with sriracha mayo, these fries are to-die-for. My fiancé and I also split the 4-cheese grilled cheese with tomato jam, put the ketchup away because that jam is perfect! To drink I also indulged in the beef-bacon Caesar which is spicy but none-the-less delicious and garnished with a perfectly crispy piece of beef bacon on top.   My only complaint is that I do not live next door to this place so I could indulge all the time!"}
{"text":"Still excellent.  Glad to see they have remained consistent.  Tried the fried chicken and sloppy joe.  The chicken portion was HUGE and the bird was tender and juicy. the accompanying sauce was sweet with a peppery heat that lingered in a good way.  For me the standout was the sloppy joe-the chili was one of the best I have tasted.  Nicely balanced, not too acidic and hearty.  Service was prompt and our server was affable."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed myself here. The White Brick Kitchen serves up some real hearty comfort food. I had the buttermilk fried half chicken with biscuits and scrumptious salad slaw. Good thing I was hungry, because the portions were huge! The chicken was very good and the slaw was sweet. The biscuits were just a tad dry, but still quite tasty. I didn't have any room for dessert, but I did have the Lindt hot chocolate and that might as well have been dessert. It was UH-MAY-ZING; best I've ever had! So smooth and chocolatey and distinctly Lindt. Two others at the table split the sticky toffee pudding, which they enjoyed.   Everyone had a great time here. The restaurant is intimate and quiet. Our server was very sweet and I will definitely come back to try something else."}
{"text":"The White Brick Kitchen is a cute diner that was featured on You Gotta Eat Here. It serves comfort food in a cute retro diner that reminds you of a simpler time. Try to get there early on the weekends as it is always busy.   White Brick Kitchen is known for its fried chicken and waffles, which would highly recommend. The fried chicken just may be the best in Toronto. The contrast of the savoury and crispy fried chicken sitting on a bed of fluffy waffles is really the reason you come to White Brick Kitchen.   In addition to the fried chicken and waffles, we also ordered the mac and cheese which was elevated gourmet mac and cheese.   I would recommend White Brick Kitchen if you are looking for a fun dining spot that's simple and not fancy but serves really good comfort food."}
{"text":"Overview: Best fried chicken and waffles!   This place was a great surprise. Decided to try as I'm a huge fan of chicken and waffles.  The staff were nice and the atmosphere was cool and casual. We ordered two orders of fried chicken (spicy, one with waffles and spiralled carrots in a vinegrette, the other regular, with salad and biscuits), an order of Joe fries, and Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was good,  portion was average and came with garlic bread.  The starts were the Joe fries and fried chicken.  The Joe fries are probably the best loaded fries I've had.  It was hearty with meat and the portion was huge ($14). For $18,  for get half a fried chicken and sides!  Anywhere else for that prices you get two small pieces of chicken.  The chicken itself was fried well and the meat and juicy,  even the breast.  The waffle could have been more crisp but that's me being picky.  The biscuits were good and not overly buttery. Overall I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sunday brunch menu. My boyfriend and I had the Double Down & The Big Jambon. Chicken in the Double Down was soft, moist and flavourful. The waffle, ham, egg combo in The Big Jambon was delicious, wasn't a big fan of the beans but it did add an element of savory to the dish; might go without the beans next time. Would definately go back and recommend this cute spot to friends!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Been wanting to try this place for some time now and I'm happy I finally got the chance. I was also lucky enough that there were a few tables available so we didn't have to wait at all. Another bonus was how accomodating they were for kids. It was spacious enough to have a stroller go through and they even had high chairs available. The staff were all very friendly and knowledgable of the menu and could provide feedback when questioned. Their chicken was very moist and flavourful. Although, the chicken on my dish was a lot saltier then the fried chicken in another dish. But the flavour combos were very delicious. The portions were huge in my opinion as guests from my party were unable to finish their meals and some had to pack some up. Their mashed potatoes were very good and the poutine upgrade was definitely worth it. BONUS - their gravy is vegan and very delicious at that (coming from an everything eater). I'd come back for sure but know now to share dishes versus trying to finish one on my own. HA"}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait when we got there, but it wasn't long at all. Probably waited 10 minutes. The menu was small. I ordered the blueberry cheesecake waffle and it was amazing. My friend had the banana foster french toast which was good but a little too sweet for my liking. It tasted more like a dessert than bunch. I would go here again for the waffle though."}
{"text":"Had Fried chicken and Waffle.  Wow, big portion and great pieces of chickens.  But the line up was insane when I went there for Sunday lunch.  They need to train staff better with seating arrangements."}
{"text":"The Scotchish Eggs rule. Everything from the accompanying griddled, buttered baguette and delicious fresh parmesan-spiked mixed greens (which are often such a loveless throwaway--not at WB) with these perfectly cooked panko-crusted poached eggs ... heaven. We sampled their (all house made) bacon, beef bacon and sausage. The sausage was the real ringer for me--lean and flavorful. /The only bummer is that it's only available on Sundays. Bet they'd boom if they served brunch on Saturday as well.   The environment is comfortable and unpretentious. Service is great. The whole family helps out. Even the mom and dad are serving and bussing on Sunday brunch. The place is super-clean, which I like, especially the bathrooms (mom?). Coffee's all right, but cups are small. Ceasars are delicious. Tater tots are wow.   At dinner, I've had the mac n cheese, which is a 10. It's the spattering of oven-dried tomatoes that take it to another level! And the sauce! Their side garlicky parsnip mash is excellent, as are their biscuits. The turkey stew was really nice--especially cuz we ordered takeout when we all had colds. Meatloaf is ok. But I don't really like meatloaf so who's to say? Fried chicken is quite stellar.  Cutie pie desserts are a must!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the dining experience and the Fried Chicken and sides. I wasnt a fan of their coleslaw and the service was too slow the times ive been there to the point where i get so hungry I don't enjoy the dining experience most of the time. the chicken used to be the best in town and hasn't gotten worse, but there is at least one other place that is wayyy better in town."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the White Brick Kitchen. The funny thing is, I've never tried anything too adventurous here. I usually just get the traditional breakfast fare, which includes two eggs, potatoes, toast, and your choice of sausage or bacon. I don't eat meat so usually give my meat to one of my friends or get greens instead.  While what I order is always such a basic meal, how White Brick Kitchen does it up is always impressive. For starters, the scrambled eggs are always perfect. They put a little bit of salt and pepper, and who knows what else in them, and they literally are some of the tastiest scramblies you'll have. Trust me. And then the potatoes - wow, those potatoes. They're so so so good. Probably one of the best places for breakfast potatotes in the city! And the toast is always really great, and the greens always leave me happy. I've been told the sausage and bacon are also very impressive.   The fresh squeezed grapefruit juice is also a really great treat from here.   All in all, if you want a really satisfying breakfast served up by some fabulously friendly individuals, you have to try this place. :)"}
{"text":"This joint, smack dab in the middle of Korea Town, is not... Korean. But given its American comfort food, which by the way, is super filling and super tasty, it has it's own bold appeal that warrants another visit from myself, just as soon as I finish my left overs!  Every thing I ate in this kitchen was really good. The service is kind, informative and tends to you as they should. The atmosphere actually felt slightly less casual than I expected. Maybe it's due to the darker painted walls or choice of furnishings, but it felt colder than I imagined it to be? Not a problem, just a note.  I ordered the half fried chicken meal, thinking that I was a 'real' man for ordering such a massive dish. But man-alive, it was a five piece fried chicken bonanza!  Complete with deliciously buttered biscuits and fresh cut fries. The chicken was flavorful, crispy, tender and juicy all at once.  Definitely hits the fried chicken spot and is ironically sitting across a KFC.   I also tried their homemade chips, which were crispy, crunchy sheets that were well- spiced and not disappointing. The vegan dish was packed with amazing flavor and  textures as well. I'd be happy to order any of the dishes on the menu. All sounds great, and from what I had, are also delicious!   Overall, I'd return for their food! It's portioned well, prices are reasonable and service was attentive. Great date spot and also looks really idea for a brunch."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday at around 11 for brunch expecting to have to wait a while for a table, but we were able to get a seat at the patio immediately. We were told that there was a 75 minute seating limit, but we were able to stay longer, as it wasn't too busy.   I ordered the classic breakfast with 2 slices of toast, 2 poached eggs, a sausage, and fries. All of that only cost $11.25, which is a pretty good value considering the amount of food that was piled on my plate - way too much for me to finish. I expected to get smaller breakfast sausages instead of the one big sausage, but it was good nonetheless.   My friends ordered the Belgian waffle with blueberry cream cheese icing as well as the eggs benedict with bacon and they were both over the moon with their orders. I wasn't able to get a picture of their food because they had dug in as soon as it arrived.   The only downside was that the patio was quite windy, and the dust from the neighbouring construction was blowing into our food/coffee.   I definitely want to come back and try their chicken and waffles, but I'd probably opt for a table inside on my next visit."}
{"text":"This past Saturday I was in Koreatown and I decided to drop by White Brick Kitchen with a friend for brunch. The wait time was approximately 30 minutes. Once we were seated, we found out brunch was only available on Sundays which was a little disappointing.  The decor was new and the seating was a mix of booths and tables. The spacing between the tables were well thought out. The tables far are enough, so you are comfortable eating and not worried about bumping into your neighbours table once you get up.  I decided on the classic breakfast ($9) which consisted of either white or brown toast, two eggs, potatoes and a choice of either hickory bacon, beef bacon or sage sausage with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice ($3). The classic breakfast was nicely done, the eggs were perfectly done (sunny side up), the potatoes were perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned and the toast was perfect. The bacon could have been a little bit crispier for my liking.  My friend ordered Joe Fries ($14) which consisted of bacon brisket sloppy joe, fresh cut fries, sriracha mayo with a fried egg accompanied by a regular coffee ($2.50 and bottomless). The dish was pretty good, the fries were nicely done and crisp but not too crisp and the bacon brisket sloppy joe was really good, nicely seasoned, flavourful and moist. My friend also mentioned that the coffee was fresh and qood. The portions for this particular dish was quite large.  The server was friendly and overall I would say that the service was good but not great.  Next time I'm in the area on a Sunday I'll definitely drop by to try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Glad I had the fried chicken. Really good. I couldn't touch it for 10-15 minutes cause it was so hot! Freshly made. Crispy skin reminds me of Popeyes chicken but better and not oily at all!  Now I know better cause I ordered chicken at the stockyards and it was oily compared to this one.  My sister had the burger. Was good. She found it rich. I don't know if they butter the bun or something. It was good but she couldn't finish it.  Fries were awesome! But you have to like black pepper as it is sprinkled on liberally.  Coleslaw was only meh. It was ok but nothing special.  Worth going back for the chicken. I had their house sauce. Kinda reminded me or sirracha but better.  I thought price was good $13 for 3 pieces of chicken with 1 side. Cost extra for the sauce though."}
{"text":"Very good comfort food I'm a casual setting in koreatown. I've had the fried chicken for dinner , so good . And the fried chicken club for lunch which was absolutely insanely good. Wish they had a espresso machine. The type of place where the side salad they serve is actually good not some sad wilted mess. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Some friends decided to have dinner there because other surrounding places in Korea Town were crowded.  We all tried each other's food: mac & cheese had tons of cheese but nothing special; the only highlight of the shepherd's pie was the scallion biscuit - it was just the right taste and texture inside and out; the meat in Joe's fries didn't have much flavour; the tater tots were fried just right, the sauce that came with it was not overpowering, the devil's eggs were the most creative dish as it was topped with an olive and crispy tortilla for texture.  The portions of the meal were big but I wouldn't pay those prices ($14 - $17) for those kinds of comfort food again.  The waitress was inexperienced because she didn't know the menu and had to ask the cooks and she didn't handle the food and drinks properly (two of the dishes touched my friend's shirt while she was putting it down) but we tipped really generously (17% - 20%) because she was really friendly, had a sweet smile on all the time, and she was trying hard to help, plus, we had a great time with each other and the food came in a timely manner.  The drinks are cheap there though!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Went with my family, and instantly smitten by the warm greeting we received from the host. The place doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that deter you. Food was awesome, and every dish was worth ordering again (in fact we ordered more than we should have because of the great flavours).  The burger was one of the best we ever had, fries & chips were excellent too.  The mac and cheese was rich but not overwhelmingly so.  Drinks were good and fairly priced.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"About a 30 min+ wait for Sunday brunch 1pm-- expected. This place is small with not many tables. We came here for their famous fried chicken.  The service is amazing 4/5 stars because the staff is very friendly, attentive, gives menu suggestions and makes conversation.  The food is also good quality and unique. the only reason why my rating dropped from a 4 star to a 3 is because the food is so salty!  I shared the fried chicken club with a friend (so nice of them to have split the sandwich in half and plated the halves on separate plates). I think the sandwich would do without the mayo and bacon-- my lips were burning from salt after eating it. Having said, the chicken is crispy and juicy inside, and the bun is buttery and soft. Good cheat meal. I'd say half is satisfying enough.  Our waitress recommended the butter tart waffle, it was okay--the waffle is fluffy and soft.  No doubt is this comfort food. I would come here again had the food not been so salty."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom biscuits and gravy nom.  Sat on their adorable patio and enjoyed some deliciously cheap mimosas.  I don't remember what else I ordered besides a side biscuit/gravy, but everything we had was delicious.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"My party of 3 came right at 11AM, the opening time and was seated immediately. Honestly had we came 15 mins later we would've had to wait in line. The line this morning wasn't too bad, maybe because it's Saturday so no brunch menu and the weather was so chilly. Yes, much to my dismay brunch is only offered on Sundays (goodbye egg Benny's and french toast). However, they do offer their excellent mains, i.e. chicken waffles, and breakfast menu every single day.  Food- 3/5. I think I'm getting pickier with brunch foods. Normally I would've rated the food here at least 4/5, but after having brunch at Insomnia just a block east and getting into a healthier craze lately, I could only give 3 stars. I'm disappointed with the scarcity of vegetarian and vegan friendly options here. WBK is a cozier, less franchised version of American comfort food, like Denny's. So, lots of meat, waffles, fried potatoes, and grease. Interestingly there's not a lot of egg breakfast options and definitely no seafood. For a pescatarian this was devastating.  I ordered their only vegan main - the vegetable curry, which contained raisins, onion, tomatoes, celery, big almonds, etc and came with loose rice and a papadum. Flavor-wise, it was delicious! Not spicy at all and not super strongly seasoned as ethnic curries can be, but very nourishing and vegetable-heavy, which is amazing inside this establishment of greasy bacon and fries.   My friends ordered the classic breakfast platter of 4 choices and the chicken and waffles, which comes with one sauce of choice (+$2 for extra sauces), which was gigantic and according to them the chicken was perfectly fried. The fried potato slices in the breakfast platter was such a perfect balance between crispy and chewy - highly recommend! Her fried eggs were really greasy though and the salad greens were really boring, literally just leaves and dressing.  Sad, limited dessert options. Come here for the savory and oily, not for sweets.  Value- 3.5/5. Moderately pricy for breakfast with entrees around $15-20, but big portions.  Service- 4/5. Very nice servers, but food took 20 minutes to come... So slow!  Last tip: reservations for brunch is not accepted, so come early and expect a wait."}
{"text":"Great amazing fried chicken. Their tangy, sweet & spicy sauce was one of the best sauces I've tasted. Great service as well. Can wait to go again."}
{"text":"A Must - go here! The food is amazing staff is awesome! Its my go-to weekly brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch during the holidays. The place is TINY, we had to wait about 30 mins to get seated, which was okay and expected. With that said I wouldn't come here if I had a group of more than 4 people.   I got the standard breakfast (forgot what it was called) that came with whole grain toast, bacon, home fries and 2 eggs made to order (I got them poached) and a mimosa. My boyfriend got the eggs benny and a caesar. My breakfasst was delicious, the home fries were made perfrectly and the bacon was cooked just the way I like it (crispy). My poached egg was a little too well done but what can you do... My boyfriend really enjoyed his eggs benny and his eggs were perfectly made - not too well done like mine. The portions were a good amount and we were stuffed once finished. My boyfriend said the caesar had an odd taste to it initially but then once he was finished he said it really enjoyed it! (boys.. can't make up their minds lol) Our whole meal came to about $40 after tip, which was good considering I've paid much more for pretty much the same thing at other places.   Service was nice, but not as attentive as I would have liked - maybe because we were sitting near the back. I'll definitely be coming back here to try their famous fried chicken during dinner time!"}
{"text":"Totally delicious food with friendly service. Have been wanting to try this place for a while now.  Had no issues making a reservation for 7 peeps a couple of days before, the gentleman was super lovely and friendly who took my call. They also had no qualms about separating the bills.  Enjoyed a few cocktails with dinner, including an apple cider mimosa (so so good!), one of their drink features. We were entertaining family from the States so of course we had to order a couple of poutines as starters to share, which were very good.  I opted for the mac and cheese as my main and did not regret it. The noodles were perfectly cooked, drowning in creamy cheesy goodness and topped with crispy butter Ritz crackers. I'm drooling thinking about it tbh. Most of our table got either the chicken and waffles or half chicken, everyone was totally stuffed but loved their food.  Note, if you are on a diet - don't come here. They serve decadent and super yummy comfort food that sticks to your bones and warms your belly. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait long on weekends for brunch!I came here on a Sunday for brunch (for 2 people) around 11:30 am and had to wait ~45 minutes. Good thing there's PAT and Bloor Fruit market down the street, so you could definitely do some grocery shopping while waiting. :P   We ordered the Sunday Special which consisted of a poached egg deep fried in panko, on top of 2 slices of american cheese and sausage in between two toasted buns and a side of their potatoes, and we also ordered the Big Jambon which has ham, baked beans, swiss cheese and maple fried eggs on top of a big buttermilk waffle. Both dishes were super delicious and tasted amazing! If I come again for brunch, I might skip their side of potatoes (they were pretty much crispy chips) and opt for something else. Definitely come to try the poached egg!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Wonderful service, clean, good menu. Unique food,large portions, great drinks!! Not much else for us in the area, a great go to before or after Hot Docs."}
{"text":"Fabulous Home Comfort Food! I had the Rarebit, excellent, son had Vegan Country stew. Very creative dishes that taste fabulous."}
{"text":"This is a good ultimate comfort food place to go to if you break up with a boyfriend or hate your life.  The mac and cheese was to die for and the fried buttermilk chicken will get your heart screaming 'uncle'.  This place is noticeably expensive so bring your wallet."}
{"text":"My friend and I... did not make the right selections as it seems we cannot partake in the rave reviews found here. Tried their eggs benny and have definitely had better. The breakfast custard (custard topped with granola and berry compote) is better shared with friends. Very enjoyable in a few mouthfuls but too much to eat on one's own (too sweet).   I'm curious about this place (by 11, the lines go around the corner...) so, will be back to try the other (savoury) items."}
{"text":"I'll make this brief, this place is the bomb!   Wait time was about 20 min for brunch on Sunday. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food came out super quick. They unfortunately ran out Scottish Eggs to my disappointment and their omelette of the day. I definitely won't come close to closing next time.   With my main options gone I decided to go for the Eggs Benny with the sage sausage and I'm so glad I did! It was just delicious, everything seemed to have just the right amount of flavour. Simple yet delicious. I'll definitely be back here to try their whole brunch menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Definitely good quality fried chicken and waffles. Was just hoping the server would have suggested more because my plate was emptied ver quick lol. Only downfall was waiting in a tiny little corner of the room for a table. Too cold to wait outside. Reservations probably recommended."}
{"text":"We returned for a second visit, after really enjoying our first. We were not disappointed !! :) It was just as good as the first visit. It was very busy hectic Saturday but we got a great booth and did not feel rushed. I ordered a classic english breakfast with coffee and it was all fresh hot and perfect. Again, the service was great. Cant wait for round 3!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The mac & cheese was so tasty and big portion sizes, the place is a little so it's hard to get into at times but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ultimate fried chicken craving satisfaction!  We were out and about in downtown last night, and had a craving for Fried chicken, we came to white brick and ordered buttermilk chicken. It was the best fried chicken I have had in a long while, Popeye's and other popular fried chicken has nothing on this one! The potion size was huge, even with my huge appetite, I had to push myself to finish it, so the $19 purchase is completely justified!  But the best part, the SAUCE! the \"hot\" sauce is a must buy with that fried chicken, its more of a \"sweet chilli\" sauce, but it's something out of this world!  The place was kinda loud as there was a Birthday going on, the service is really nice though: My friend dropped his phone behind the chair, and our server took it out without even letting us try."}
{"text":"Wait was long, service was friendly and good. Food was not. It was bland and they topped everything with orange cheddar. Needless to say it was not appetizing. Presentation was good though.  I saw they had chicken and waffles, it seems like everyone likes it so I might come back to try that."}
{"text":"Braved some serious winter chill while hustling along Bloor st (Koreatown) to try this \"You Gotta Eat Here\" star.  We arrived early, 5:30 - and were seated right in the window. Restaurant is pretty casual and staff were just lovely. I passed on the festive beverages and got right to the main event: Husband ordered fried chicken & biscuits and I ordered the grilled cheese: - Portions are HUGE which is awesome so come HUNGRY! - Fries are awesome and tasty - Fried chicken is a complete stand out  - batter is not heavy or chewy - seriously perfect for the fried chicken connoisseur  - My grilled cheese was also delicious (cheesy, stuffed with all the good (bad) stuff - cheese, bacon buttery & crisp thick but bread) - Prices are fantastic for your portion size and quality.   This spot is a total gem - complete, indulgent comfort food. We are heading back for the famous Fried Chicken & Waffles today. My best advice to a potential diner here is to come hungry & head straight home for a carb coma afterwards ;)"}
{"text":"Brunch with friends seems like the perfect end to a few weeks off.  I've heard lots of positive things about this restauarnt and have passed by numerous times so I was excited to try it out finally.  This place is tiny (narrow) and there always appears to be a line up.  Unfortunately there isn't anywhere to line up.  If you wait here you are literally in everyone's way.  Constantly having to do the \"excuse me dance\".  Also, I don't like people all crammed up by my table overlooking my food...lol.  Luckily we didn't have to wait too long and got a table in the middle of the restaurant.  There are a few small tables at the front, however if you want the constant blast of cold air from the door opening then sit here.  If not, ask to sit further back.  Our server was really friendly and made suggestions when we asked for recommendations.  I asked for the fried chicken benny with a side of beans (you can choose beans, fries, salad) and wanted to know if they could poach the eggs hard (any one that knows me knows i don't like egg porn).  The eggs came out perfectly.  The fried chicken was ok - I wish it had more...something....spice perhaps.  But it was nice and hot and crispy so that was good.  We had to ask for hot sauce on the side.  It came in a tiny cup.  The beans were slighlty too sweet for my liking.  Overall it was an ok brunch.  The grapefruit mango mimosa is stuff you would write home about - the tartness of the grapefruit married with the sweetness of the mango - delicious.    I'd like to come back and try their dinner menu :)"}
{"text":"For regular brunch menu I'd say 3 stars nothing special. It gets 4 because of the god damned fried chicken."}
{"text":"Lets just say that if you order the grilled cheese, you're gonna get a loaf of bread with a block of cheese on it.   And unless you're filming the latest episode of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, that isn't a good thing."}
{"text":"Didn't come on the right day to try their Sunday brunch menu. We came on a Saturday and their menu was definitely a lunch menu. Their most famous item was the chicken and waffle which we definitely ordered. Then we ordered the 4 cheese Mac n cheese.   Food came out pretty quick and the chicken was really tender and moist with just the right amount of salt. I still don't understand the waffle part of this item, but people seem to really rave about it. Their chicken and waffles looked like it came with a syrup (like a breakfast syrup for pancakes) but it actually came with a sweet sour and spicy Thai sauce which paired really well with this fried item.  The 4-cheese Mac n cheese was absolutely amazing. It kind of looked like a bowl of cheese soup at first but it was so good! I can't even describe the flavors.  Would definitely come back for a try for the brunch menu. Saw many great reviews about it!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday and it was amazing. To date, this is the best chicken and waffles I have had! Go early! There was a lineup before the restaurant even opened and it filled up in minutes. Downside is that it was a little pricey but I still enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Lovely service and easily the BEST waffles I've had ever! Wish they had a bigger menu with more choices!"}
{"text":"They only offer brunch on the Sunday mornings from 9AM to 4PM but they open daily from 11AM to 9:30PM serving up both lunch and dinner dishes. Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays, just a heads up. The decor is simple and very basic. Throughout the restaurant, black tables with basic wooden chairs can be seen and there are also booths located near the middle and at the back of the restaurant. It can get very cramped the peak hours (usually around noon) so I recommend that you make your way to The White Brick Kitchen around 10AM (for brunch sunday) and around 12PM (for daily lunch) to avoid the super long line ups. I also recommend that your party size to be about 2-4, any bigger and it'll be uncomfortable and difficult to seat all of you.  I came here with a friend on a Saturday and ordered the Chicken and Waffles (only on Saturdays) and their special Four Mac and Cheese that's extra cheesy.  Seriously one of the best mac and cheeses that I've ever had. The pasta had oven dried tomatoes mixed into it and it really enhanced the flavours of the mac and cheese. The hard chewy tangy taste of the tomatoes paired up nicely with the savoury mushy and cheesy taste of the pasta dish. It also came with a piece of garlic bread and it tasted exactly how a piece of garlic bread should taste like.  Now onto the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Be warned, this dish comes with a lot of chicken. It comes with four pieces of chicken, half dark meat and half white meat and it's been fried to perfection. The waffle was good to but there was nothing to write home about. We paid an extra $2 for their special hot sauce and it was worth it. The hot sauce was sweet and tangy and it paired up nicely with the chicken and waffles.  Overall, White Brick Kitchen is now my go-to for chicken and waffles. Portions were generous and the price was right. Every fried chicken lover needs to check it out ASAP!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Sunday brunch with a friend. The service is fantastic. The atmosphere is good and the coffee has free refills (they don't have lattes, only drip coffee).  The food is mediocre though. My friend had the Sunday special and I had the benny. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch. Very friendly staff. It wasn't too busy and we got seats no problem on a saturday around 11am. but they also had the patio opened too so there were extra seats. We both got the scotch-ish eggs and the sauce was delish! Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Went to the White Brick Kitchen three times in the past 2 months. Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place!   We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters!   The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people.   Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though.   The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!  The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay. Only two waiters working when we went so it was a bit slow, but they were all super friendly! Will be coming back here again! One of my fave American food places for sure!"}
{"text":"Not too happy with the service...  First off, The food was great, prices are extremely affordable and reasonable (each dish are around $10-$11 dollars on average). Staff were friendly. Love their bottomless coffee.   What I didn't like about this restaurant was their hygiene. (Not the dining area but the kitchen.)  1. The waitress brought over 4 plates for us to share the food but they were both wet and dirty So she had to swap them.    2. We ordered a apple waffle with icecream, we split that among the 4 of us and later on my friend found a piece of hair on her portion, while the rest of us have already finished ours without looking. We called over the waitress she said she could only cancel the 1/4 or give us 1/4 of a new one. I thought thats kinda silly because they should go an extra mile and cancel the entire order or give us a free one, since they made a mistake on their end. We did make that suggestion however the waitress rejected it saying she can't do that because the rest of us already ate our portions So she could only do the 1/4."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, only available at Sunday brunch, is a dish worth lining up for at this cute little comfort-food cafe. The chicken is supremely crisp and delicious, and pairs perfectly with poached eggs and rich Hollandaise, all perched on a toasted-till-crunchy Scottish bap bun. I upgraded my fries to a poutine for an extra $1.50 (no brainer) and washed it all down with a killer Vanilla Bourbon Milkshake. I strongly recommend the boozy shake, but not sure I needed the poutine. Fries alone would have been plenty.  Dave ordered the classic fried chicken sandwich, served with lettuce and an ample helping of mayo and hot sauce. I took a few bites of it and gotta say, the fried chicken shines brighter in the benny. First, the sandwich arrived slightly soggy and became more so with each bite, thus diminishing the crispiness of the chicken. So if you're keen on fried bird during non-brunching hours I'd probably opt for the fried chicken dinner, with sauce on side."}
{"text":"Had to kill some time downtown in the annex. Stopped in for a solo lunch. Not very busy during the weekdays -  good time to go. Small, cozy, simple place... With wooden booths. Ordered the fried chicken $18 since it's their staple. Very moist. Very crispy. Carrot and beet slaw as a side for good balance. Biscuits were good. Fried chicken doesn't come w gravy... But w their sweet/sour hot sauce... For extra $2.. Wasn't impressed that they charge for sauce. I think it's very good.. But I don't think I would say it's the best. Would want to come back and check out their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Long wait to be seated. Partially because they sat a party of 2 at a table for 4 and didnt separate the other table for 2, twice.   Once we ordered the food took a while and my girlfriends eggs arrived cold. The bacon was also cold but not as bad as the eggs. My chicken and waffles was served hot and was delicious. Had to go up and ask for new eggs as the server didn't come back to check on us.   It feels like minimal thought went in to the seating plan and layout of this place. The kitchen takes up more space than it should and tables are just kind of there."}
{"text":"I ordered the blueberry cheesecake waffle and it was amazing (it also came with bacon on the side).  When I first walked into the restaurant, I noticed someone eating this and had to have it.  Overall, it was a good pick and no regrets.  Service was good.  The only thing that sucks is if you have to wait in line since this place does not take reservations.  Anyway, still worth the wait...."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo GOOOOOOOOD!!!! I was just passing by this place long back, read \"Best Chicken in Town\" and laughed out thinking how could someone claim that they are the best in the city when there are so many great fried chicken restaurants here. Decided to visit this place to check it out.  After having their food all they claim is nothing but TRUTH!!  Ordered 4 Cheese Mac 'n Cheese, Buttermilk Fried Chicken with their Thai chilli sauce (Yes! you have to order it seperately) and Poutine. For the drinks we ordered Beef Salami Caesar and Orange Creamsicle. Beef Salami Caesar was amazing. Though I don't drink that often but believe me Beef Salami Caesar is one of the best cocktails I've had so far. My husband also enjoyed his drink and said the same about his drink too.  All the dishes were mind blowingly good. Mac n' Cheese was the best I've had so far. It was topped with Ritz Crackers and was served with delicious garlic bread. It had the perfect proportion of the sauce, cheese and crunch. Fried Chicken came with Biscuit. Chicken had the right kind of crunch and was super juicy inside. Cooked to Perfection! Biscuit was as good as it can get, buttery with the right kind of softness it should have from the inside. Poutine was amazing too I think they make their brown sauce in house and that's what made it even more yumm!  Will definitely go back to this place as it has become one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"My new favourite Brunch resto! What can I say...I'm a big fan of their fried chicken! So the fact that they had a fried chicken Benny made me super excited!   This Diner is a jackpot! Fast and kind service, old school/hip diner ambiance, and bomb diggity food made this an easy 5/5 stars for me!   It is definitely busy on Brunch days but the food is worth the wait! They do not take any reservations !  Now let's talk about the Fried Chicken! Hot, fresh, crispy and not oily! I loved and enjoyed every part of it. The flavour is complex yet easy to love. The coating isn't too thick, the meat is juicy and fresh! It's everything u want in a fried chicken.   Talking about this place is really getting me hungry. Also, I encourage you to try their waffles!!!! Pls and thank you! And don't skimp out of the waffles sauce... just pay the extra fee and get the damn maple syrup!"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot! Right when I walked into the restaurant I could smell all sorts of yummy aromas coming from the kitchen, so I knew I had picked a good one. :) I had the joe fries, which were delicious. They were spicier than I expected, even with the spicy mayo on the side, but the flavours went together really nicely and the fries weren't too soggy, which is a problem I frequently find with chilli fries. The chilli part was very hearty, and the portion was huge! They are probably meant for two people instead of one. I took the rest home. Definitely somewhere I will return. I'm eager to try their fried chicken as well."}
{"text":"So, after wanting to come here for awhile (keeping in mind, I don't do line ups - I've done my time) - we were up bright and early, I called them to see if there was a lineup and lo and behold there was NOT!!! We hopped into the Food Review Bat Mobile and boyfriend dropped me off, I ran inside to secure seating while he found parking. They seated us in the back, next to the patio door, but it wasn't very hot out and the a/c was blasting on us, so they kindly let us move (just one booth over). The menus (solid, old-fashioned, leather-like, heavy) are a nice touch that seems to work well with the decor. I like the lighting and seating as well. Not a lot of seats inside but keep in mind there's also a patio. Unfortunately they don't have the same menu on Saturday as they do for Sunday Brunch (have been DYING to try to scotch eggs!!!). I ordered the Burger Special (which had a duck egg plus on it). I also made the mistake of ordering the kettle chips (house made). The burger was very good but I'm not a big chip/french fry person, and they'd piled so many on the plate that they kept falling off onto the table every time I took a bite of my burger (it's rare that you'll ever hear me complaining about too much food). Next time I'd order a different side. I would have been happier with some veggies/slaw/salad..Boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. Chicken was done right (proper batter, cooked at a hot enough temperature so that the chicken is cooked through, batter is just right and not greasy at all) and had a kick to it - definitely pay a bit extra to add the spicy sauce! I would definitely come back here to check out some of their other foods."}
{"text":"WBK is the absolute ultimate brunch destination. The food is simply unmatched - their signature Fried Chicken Benny (I take it with baked beans) melts in your mouth. Come early as by 11 you will be waiting but it is seriously worth it. The staff are fantastic and about the most efficient and naturally friendly squad manning the number 1 breakfast or brunch restaurant in the GTA. Cannot recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"Great hidden (but who knows for how long) GEM in koreatown! Refreshing selection. Have only been there for brunch a few times. Very delicious every time. I especially love their \"Scotchish\" eggs with panko on baguette. So delicious and innovative.   The only thing is, check when brunch is served, I think it might not be available on Saturdays (?)"}
{"text":"Had their burger special which was turkey burger with 2 fried slabs of sage dressing, and cranberry on a bun. It came with beet coleslaw.  A big portion burger as well as close to a cup of coleslaw. Price was 15 bucks. Turned out to be nothing that special. The dressing slabs were like hashbrowns at McDonald's and had almost as much Oil.  No real zest to the cranberry sauce and the bun and burger were just average. I found the coleslaw quite basic as well. Drink menu looked good with lots of reasonable prices. It is a small restaurant so you could expect to wait for a table. The menu is small too.  I don't think I need to return again."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place for years and it did not disappoint. My fiancé and I came here for Sunday brunch and it does get very busy. They do not take reservations for brunch, first come first served. They have a sign in front that says \"the best fried chicken in town\" and it was outstanding. I ordered the WBK Fried Chicken sandwich with fries and they give you 2 large pieces of chicken, perfectly fried on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. It is topped with lettuce, brown butter mayo and hot sauce that enhances the flavours. I opted for fries as a side and they were very tasty and well seasoned.   My fiancé ordered the fried chicken benny which was great. The same fried chicken topped with 2 poached eggs and a brown butter hollandaise. We also started with a plain waffle which was light and crispy, topped with real maple syrup, a nice way to begin our meal.   The service was quick and attentive, and despite how busy it was, the orders came out very quickly. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the 4-star Yelp review, which is usually a pretty good indicator of the quality of the restaurant, but I have to say Yelp, you let me down this time.  We approached the restaurant and saw a sizeable crowd waiting outside. We were a party of two, and went in to put our names on the list. One of the servers told us it would be a 20 minute wait. We wrote our names down, wrote our cellphone number in the \"Cell Phone\" column on the list, and went for a coffee down the street. We came back 20 minutes later, and proceeded to wait a full hour to hour and fifteen minutes more. Now, I know the server doesn't total control over wait times, especially since there was a table of two that stayed for at least 20 minutes after they had received their bill, but given that we waited almost 3-4x longer than she originally estimated, we were pretty frustrated, especially since we would have gone somewhere else had we known it would take this long.   As we waited for the people at the table table of two to finally finish, I went to the list and saw that we were the next party of two to be seated, and was relieved when the people at the table finally got up. By this time it was 1:30pm, we hadn't eaten anything all day, and were starved and annoyed. Instead of calling our names, the server another two women sit down ahead of us. When she had finished seating these women, I pointed out that we had been the next people on the list. She then told us that she called our names and we didn't respond which was certainly not the case. We were waiting right there for over an hour, and no one called our name. We saw her seat these women without even checking the list. I also pointed out that our cell phone number was in the \"Cell Phone\" column on the list, and asked why she didn't call us. She made up some flubby excuse, and I just told her to forget about it since all I wanted to do was finally sit down and eat. I can understand if you made a mistake and accidentally let someone ahead of us as I am usually quite forgiving and understanding under these circumstances, but don't make it seem like it was the customers' fault when it was clearly you who screwed up. This was extremely annoying given everything that had happened so far.   When we finally sat down, I hoped the food would at least somewhat redeem our experience up until that point, but sadly both meals fell flat. I ordered the bacon hash which tasted way too much like Chef Boyardee, or some sort of other canned meat. I was famished and normally have an above average appetite, but I left at least 1/3 of my meal because it was so dissatisfying. The person I was with had the sausage and biscuits which was good for a couple of bites, but was way too salty and tasted little better than something you could get at any average diner where you wouldn't have to wait an hour and a half to eat. She didn't finish her plate either, so I helped her considering how hungry I still was after ditching the rest of my Chef Boyardee hash. I didn't even finish the rest of her dish because the salt became way too overpowering.   The bill came and although we had a different waitress than the girl who seated us initially, I was disappointed to see that there was no offer to comp anything on the meal given the ordeal we went through to get a table. Normally I would have spoken to a manager about this, but I was tired and aggravated enough and just wanted to get out of there.  If it wasn't for the terrible service we received at the beginning, this would have been a 2-star place because the food wasn't terrible (just below average), but the service brought it down to a one.  Overall, quite a disappointing experience.  Edit: upon reading other reviews in here, gross underestimation of wait time and accidentally allowing people to jump the queue on the list seem to be a common occurrence at this place. Get your act together!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here for ages for the chicken and waffles and alas, I ended up coming here and getting a fried chicken sandwich...which was delicious! We came early on a Saturday evening and the place was empty.   The chicken is moist on the inside and super crispy and well seasoned on the outside. The bun is toasted with butter so it's a little crispy and toasted, and it comes with lettuce and tomatoes and A LOT of mayo (which I probably should have asked to remove, but I forgot). I ordered the side salad (Which was ginormous and not your usual lame side salad fare, it was delicious), and my fried ordered the fries...also an overwhelming amount of those.   Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. Its quite small and has this mom and pop diner feel to it. Came here for dinner on a Friday evening. Ordered the chicken and waffle dinner, mac n' cheese, and mimosas. The buttermilk chicken was SO GOOD. I preferred the mac n' cheese as a side vs the waffles, but hey, to each his/her own. The mac n' cheese by the way, was smothered in cheese and very flavourful. Needless to say,  we devoured all of our food and were quite content with the food, service, and bill."}
{"text":"awesome sunday brunch place. all comfort food so forget about diet. seating time limit capped at 90 min for brunch"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and have found that of the items I have tried, their chicken and waffles are far and away the best dish.   That's not to disparage the restaurant - these are the best chicken and waffles in the city, and the spicy sauce is a must-have. Traditionally, chicken and waffles are not served with maple syrup, and I find that syrup depreciates the taste for me somewhat (though I generally do not enjoy sweets).   Their waffles are perfectly done, and the chicken is great. Maybe not the best in the city, as they claim, but still - absolutely fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I've been to White Brick a couple of times now and each has been a good experience. The menu is varied and creative and seems to change fairly often. I've really enjoyed everything I've had.  The brunch is especially good and the servers keep the coffee coming :)"}
{"text":"This was a solid brunch. Reasonable prices and well-executed dishes. The line-up was relatively short and it took about 20 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"I went here with a small group on my last night in Toronto, and am I glad we went. Place does not pretend to be anything its not. Food is basic, but plentiful and delicious. For an appetizer we had the Homemade Kettle Chips with Pimento Cheese dip. The chips were crisp, delicious, and not greasy. The dip was rich, more like a spread. The fried chicken, burgers, and meatloaf sandwich we all ordered came out warm and delicious. My one issue with the place was that there wasn't a children's menu. For my kids it wasn't an issue since their tastes are pretty adventuresome.  However, for some it could be a problem and in a town full of tourists (like me!) it would be a good idea."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken downtown, the sweet/hot sauce is to die for! The batter on the chick is what makes it!!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of brunch. And if you're looking for a brunch spot, this is the place. Came here on the weekend with two pals, after being introduced to this restaurant by another friend.   There is a huge glowing sign in the window that reads, \"Best fried chicken\" and it's not a lie. If you're coming to eat here, you best order the fried chicken because it will damn near change your life.   This is comfort food, through and through. I got the fried chicken benny ($15.50) served on an english muffin and topped with a poached egg and hollandaise. Ordered it with poutine, and good lord. I was in a food coma.   Things to note: this place is pretty small. We had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table of four, so be prepared. There are lots of coffee shops nearby and the restaurant will call you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"One of the few good Brunch place I encountered in Toronto. Not crowded (well, we were there at 10:30am), decent meal and good service. I had the egg Benny dish, it was good but I would wish they add salad along with the potatoes and the Benny.  (The Scotch-ish eggs has potatoes and salad, so why egg benny dish doesn't get salad?)  Overall it was a good brunch place and near subway, excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for monnnnnnnths but never got around to because brunch is only served sundays but I work sundays... However, I found out certain brunch items such as fried chicken and waffles is served saturdays so I went down the first saturday I was available. FYI, this is the first time I've had fried chicken and waffles in my LIFE. AND I LOVEE IT! As long as it tastes like the ones here or better, I'm good. First of all, the presentation was very instagram-worthy. On top of the fried chicken was a monstrous amount of curly shredded carrots. An amount good enough to justify that eating fried chicken and waffles can't be too bad for you. lol. Moving on to the fried chicken, it was deliciously tasty and flavourful! Although I admit the waffles lacked a biiiit of flavour but that still was not a big enough setback to give them anything less than five stars."}
{"text":"The White Brick Kitchen's location had been home to a few unsuccessful brunch spots in the past.  It's because of this I was quick to dismiss it.... until now.  I actually just happened to stop in while running errands because my tummy was telling me to EAT.  Little did I know how pleasantly surprised I'd be.  I showed up around 2pm and was immediately seated.  Suppose I missed the usual brunch line-ups because it was late in the day *bonus!*.   Decor was clean and simple using almost black furnishings to contrast the white walls.  It's a bit stark, but gives off a sense of elegance and tidiness. I did a quick glance at the menu but I already knew what I was going to order....my usual... french toast, or \"Banana Bread French Toast\" as stated on the menu. Although seeing caramelized bananas on french toast wasn't new to me (Saving Grace does this), I did like that they used Banana Bread.  Great idea!   I have a serious sweet tooth and this dish did not disappoint.  Served piping hot, with ample house made syrup, i was very....VERY happy.    The staff was courteous, quick, and friendly.  Quite frankly I couldn't have asked for a better experience, and there's no doubt I will be back...potentially for Chicken & Waffle Fridays!.  Well done White Brick Kitchen, you are now a staple in my arsenal of brunch spots!"}
{"text":"it's not diner food and it's not health food. it's decadent food that you'd expect to taste good. and it does. everything is very competently executed. imho, they've some of the best fried chicken in the city.  value isn't bad. service is friendly. the space is clean, bright and simply decorated.   i really have no complaints with anything. if fried chicken was my favorite food in the world, white brick would get an enthusiastic 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Cons The wait. We waited for one hour to be seated and there were only three groups ahead of us. There are very few tables; three booths and a couple of tables for 2. The wait for their chicken waffle is at least 20 minutes but it's more like a 30 minute wait. So, the brunch here is a 3 hour affair. Be ready to wait.   The extras. Beware that any addition will be an extra 0.50 to have a little sauce and $2 to make it hot! This is what is added to the chicken and waffle.    Pros The portions. They will be big enough even for those who eat a lot. The majority of the tables had a take out bag by the end of their meals.   The taste. The food is pretty good. The chicken waffle was crispy on the outside and still tender and moist on the inside. It also wasn't overtly salty but still well-seasoned. The burger with bacon was a tad saltier but if you have a green side, it would be perfect. The chips option though is very good and crispy. The macaroni and cheese option was the least of my favourites. There is also a huge garlic bread that comes with it.   I would come eat here again if there isn't a wait."}
{"text":"Warning: This review contains a lot of gushing and high praise. If this sort of unabashed adulation makes you uncomfortable, you might want to turn away now. You have been warned.   I HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER BRUNCH EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they're doing and I don't have even one solitary complaint (and, believe me, I'm very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so I would if I could, but I honestly can't).  Allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch.   My friend and I were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a Sunday.  It was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  I already felt very content as I sipped my OJ, little did I know that I was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  It seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the Scotch-ish Eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. The service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  On paper, the Scotch-ish Eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  I am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  I have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  Every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of Parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  I can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!  I'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the Scotch-ish Eggs, I am definitely in for a treat).  I loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  Great spot, great staff and sublime food. You really cannot ask for more!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today with some twitter friends. The brunch menu was short and sweet. I got the eggs benny. It was really good. The service was good as well. I will definitely go back.   A must try the next time you go for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is pricey but the portions are huge (stomach ache huge). I had the fried chicken and waffles and asked for them to be hot/spicy, for an extra $2. They ended up being coated in a sauce that was more cloyingly sweet than spicy. It came with a beet and carrot slaw that was ice cold and would be best served at room temperature. The server was hard to track down, we had to find her to order another drink and she did not ask us how our meal was. It was about $30 For 1 beer and dinner. I would go back to try something else, because of the rave reviews and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant brunch experience at White Brick. There is a nice patio for enjoying the sunshine.   The presentation of food was very eye-pleasing so as the taste was delicious.   The highlight of the meal was the Fried chicken and waffles: very juicy fried chicken with moist waffles. I would say White Brick has one of the best fried chicken waffle in town.   We also had the 4-cheese Mac & Cheese. It was very cheesy but I wish the Mac and cheese to be more creamy. Yet it was still enjoyable.   White Brick Kitchen is a very solid brunch place. Definitely will go back for brunch if I am in Korea town again."}
{"text":"Oooh yes...you had me at house smoked beef bacon.  Stopped into White Brick Kitchen for a week day lunch with a friend.  I ordered the BBLT ($13) as recommended by our server and a fresh squeezed grapefruit juice ($3).  The sandwich came with a half side of salad and BBQ kettle chips.  DC went with the Turkey Club ($14).  Sandwiches were served up quickly.  Loved the crispy kettle chips and the salad sides.  The BBLT was pretty awesome.  The beef bacon tasted more like beef jerky which was fine by me - salty and chewy!  A nice twist on the BLT.  Service was friendly and restaurant was baby friendly (although no change table in the bathroom which resulted in me changing my little one on a chair in front of the big glass window facing Bloor St. West for all to see - she has no shame).  Definitely will return to check out the brunch, which others are raving about."}
{"text":"Tried WBK today after much anticipation.  We had the BBQ kettle Chips and pimento, meatloaf and Mac and cheese with Dad's root beer to wash it down.  The winner of the dishes was the Mac and cheese, hand down. I must disclose my personal affinity towards this meal, but still, given all my points comparison, i conclude that it WBK version was unreal. Spiral noodles, super cheesy orange sauce with house smoked bacon, tomatoes and croutons...mmm. Good till the last bite. Didn't even require ketchup.   The meatloaf was also not too shabby. Moist, flavorful. No complaints, it was just too much food to finish.   Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"It's been a while or maybe this could be the first time I am experiencing such euphoric joy at a restaurant. Me and my girl friend walked in at approximately 12pm on a Tuesday afternoon.  We found this place whilst searching for a cafe downtown but due to unavailable parking at one location  and missing the  brunch time  at another,  we found this gem.   We were greeted by a kind gentleman named Matt.  The place had a few people inside.  First impression a no frills simple but clean environment,  comfy quality seating and extremely clean washrooms.  I really appreciate the fact that Matt served us out menus and gave us glasses of ice water right away.    My friend got the buttermilk half chicken with scallion biscuit and I got the chicken and waffles.     The waffles paired so nicely with the fried chicken.  It was very light and fluffy a perfect consistency to absorbs any syrup and my personal absolute favorite the hot and sour sauce.  Please I urge you to get the sauce.  Worth the 2 dollars and if you get the sauce on the side you get a really good amount.  Super juicy chicken with slivered green onions on top.  And generous portion amounts of CHICKEN.PLEASE FOR THE LIFE OF ME BOTTLE THAT SAUCE   My friend was raving about their biscuit. Fluffy light biscuit and the flavors complimented the chicken very well.  It is obvious they know what they are doing.    The sign on the wall thay said \"Best chicken in town!\"  is true to their word.   Thank you Matt for being the best example of  a server and never allowing my water to be half empty.    We will be back with all our friends!"}
{"text":"Went here with 2 of my best old school yelper buddies for a Shrove Tuesday pancake feast.  I had a small order of blueberry pancakes ($6) with a side of delicious bacon (cured in house!) and a fried egg. Pancakes were quite good, bacon was awesome and the fried egg was just a fried egg.  Our server was delightful and gay.  I would go back for bacon."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday to try their brunch. We had to wait in line for around 30 mins - it was well worth the wait though.   I tried the Breakfast Sandwich ($14) House Char Siu, Potatoes, Fried Egg, and Pepper Jack Cheese served in a bakery bun with fresh arugula salad on the side. I loved it. The breakfast sandwich tasted really good. The yolk was slightly runny inside. The char siu was flavorful (more on the sweet side), and the meat itself was tender, not dry at all. The roasted potatoes were stuffed in the sandwich topped with the melted cheese, potatoes were well seasoned and some pieces had a nice crisp which was delicious. Every part of the sandwich just tasted amazing alone, and even better put together! Even the salad, added a nice refreshing taste to go with the sandwich.  My boyfriend tried their Sunday special - Lamb omelette with feta cheese ($16) The dish was pulled lamb omelette, topped with feta cheese. The cheese was melted with the eggs and all 3 ingredients were very well blended together in each bite. The lamb meat was not dry, and not over salted. It also came with a fresh arugula salad on the side.   Food was good, definitely would come back. This restaurant is known for their fried chicken but unfortunately they didn't have it at the time we went. Apparently they change up their menu every so often so don't expect it to be there. One thing that slightly bugged me was there wasn't much selection on the menu for Brunch options. The breakfast sandwich actually wasn't my first choice - I was thinking of trying their eggs benedict and asked to change the muffin to a sweet potato biscuit instead (it was in the menu for a different item), but they don't do substitutions."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I've ever had, period. It honestly doesn't get better than this. Amazing food, exceptionally friendly service, and a really nice interior design. Would recommend this to anyone and I'll surely be back for more."}
{"text":"Chicken & Waffles My fiance likes to try Chicken & Waffles at different restaurants, and he said this one is the best to date. I personally think you can't really wrong with C&W (just saying lol)  Joe Fries OMG this is to die for! From now and then, I get these weird cravings for these fries so whenever we are visiting K-Town, we always get this. Huge portions! Definitely could share among 3 people.   I haven't ventured onto other items on the menu as I LOVE Joe Fries, but maybe next time I will be adventurous :)"}
{"text":"Very good food, reasonable prices and friendly staff - what more could you want? Nice outdoor patio and the garnish for your Caesar is a yummy piece of smoked bacon."}
{"text":"I just came back from my Sunday brunch at The White Brick Kitchen with my boyfriend. We were promptly seated with no line ups at all, which was pretty sweet. We ordered:  Mushroom Melt Sandwich:  The thick cut grilled pieces of bread, with cheese and thick chunks of mushroom was superb! You get a nice mouthful of juicy mushrooms in each bite. On the side it comes with well seasoned potatoes that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  The Benny: The sage sausage in this Benny has great texture and flavour that is not overly salted - just right! The hollandaise sauce and the poached eggs just melt in your mouth. Also comes with the same delicious potatoes as the melt.   Overall, the service was great, the staff was fast and friendly. The food was awesome and we'll definitely be back to try the chicken n waffles sometime!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday, late, about 2pm, so the wait wasn't long - about 20 minutes.  I had the eggs Benny and he had the Classic. Small selection of the same old same old basic breakfast options you could find anywhere. The chef doesn't seem to have any out of the box ideas for their brunch menu. The eggs at least popped and were nicely cooked though? I couldn't see anything spectacular about this place, service was fine, prices were fine, juice was fine, everything was.... fine. I didn't have a coffee."}
{"text":"Came for Brunch a few weekends ago.   The food here was pretty darn good. My partner and I usually get up pretty early on the weekend for brunch, but because we REALLY wanted to try White Brick Kitchen, we had to force ourselves to stay in bed a couple of extra hours to wait for it to open.   Glad we did.   I had the \"scotch\"ish eggs, and my partner the benny, and we licked our plates clean!  I have never eaten something as delightful as the scotchish eggs, which were perfectly done, and absolutely beautiful. I had read about them on yelp before ordering, and am really glad I did.   Rob said his benny was perfectly done, and some of the best hollandaise sauce in town (wow!).   The spot was nice and quiet for our visit, and we were able to sit in the window and do some great people watching. Service was friendly and quick.   Really enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the most amazing places for fried chicken and waffles. They offer the fried chicken in 2 varieties: original and hot. I chose the original and it was tasty and not oily at all. The waffles were fresh and soft. I also ordered birthday cake super shake and it was nice but nothing extraordinary though it had colour sprinkles. The place is tiny and have an outdoor patio as well. I went on a Friday evening around 7 and waited about 15-18 mins to get a place for 2 since I didn't want to sit on the patio.  There were only 2 servers and they were friendly and didn't bother us constantly unlike someplace where they want you to eat and leave. Even though all the tables were taken, they didn't mind us sitting after we were done our meals. This could be due the fact the kitchen had closed and were getting ready to close.  Overall, I enjoyed my time at this place and will visit again in summer to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"The entire aura of White Brick Kitchen screams \"comfort food here, come and eat your heart out.\" Seating is comfy enough, the menu is as straightforward it gets, and the staff are super chilled out. I waited almost an hour after having my burger for some buttermilk fried chicken to be made so I could take it home (they ran out before I first arrived). It lived up to expectations and then some, let's just say.  Must-try items: Fried Chicken Chicken & Waffles  I like the idea of offering burger specials and other surprise menu items. The passion, creativity, and customer service along with the food quality warrants the rave review, in my books. Not too far off the beaten path, it's a short walk here from either Bathurst or Christie subway stations. Definitely a spot to check out for chicken and beer, brunch, burgers, and all that other good stuff. Quite impressed and would make another appearance here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I'm gonna to preface this by saying, despite everything, I would go for brunch again, properly.  I had dinner and lunch a few times and talked my family I to coming here on the basis of the great brunch reviews.   The food: we did not realize they don't have a full brunch menu on Saturdays so the three of us ordered the egg and bacon breakfast. I asked for my sausages a little over done without it being immediately apparent that they are sausage patties and not links. As a result they were like little burnt hockey pucks. The breakfast as a whole was tasteless and lame. It was so disappointing.   I want to test out their Sunday brunch menu but it is a concern that just a simple breakfast was so blah"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with some friends today and decided to come at 10am to beat the line up. I ordered the banana bread French toast which was to die for! It was served with caramelized banana and caramel.   The prices are very reasonable here and the service was great. My only complaint is they don't serve espresso coffee and they should have more sweet items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here. The waffles were delicious but I wish there was more syrup on them. Their beef bacon is VERY salty. I couldn't eat it.   Small place, fast service. If there's not a long line up definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Buttermilk Fried Half Chicken with Scallion Biscuit and a  Choice of Side ($17)  That's the only thing that I need to know and would order from now on at White Brick Kitchen.  The batter is crispy and light with the perfect seasoning.   The half chicken so juicy and tender and fingerlicking good!  Eating this perfect fried chicken while staring at KFC across the street.. and now my friend you know why I don't eat Popeyes or KFC?! I am saving my fat and cholesterol intake for this!   4 Cheese Mac 'n Cheese  with  Oven Dried Tomatoes and  Garlic Toast ($14) was just passable.  Maybe we should have just order 2 orders of Fried Chicken instead?  I will be back more more Fried Chicken!"}
{"text":"Really good brunch, though not the biggest fan on their sausage eggs benedict but that's more a personal preference. The banana loaf French toast was amazing, but very rich. It would be a smart idea to just split it with someone instead of attempting to eat it all yourself."}
{"text":"This has been on my list of places to go for a while now. So for early dinner with a friend we decided to come in for some chicken and waffles! Let me start by saying, this restaurant sticks out as it is in the middle of koreatown. And I've always been curious as to why its survived long after its neighboring stores have closed down and reopened to whatever they are today. Now I have my answer. Servers were friendly and attentive, food came fast and was delicious (we were the only ones there on a Wednesday at 4pm) and place was nice.  Now lets break it down: we came in and the place looked very relaxed. The kind of place you can just sit with someone and talk. No loud music, enough space so you arent elbow to elbow with the person next to you. The servers promptly seated us, got our orders and I swear set the food and drinks down almost as fast. The drink I had was pretty meh. Too sweet. I had their version of the dark and stormy (Apparently they cant use the name due to copyright issues.) So moving on to the food... Chicken and waffles... Spicy for this girl. The food was so fresh. Chicken was juicy and tender and crispy and everything you could want in a fried chicken. The waffles were crunchy and fluffly. The combination was amazing. That was one meal I really enjoyed. Will definitely go back. I really want to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely comfort food. The fried chicken was really good. My girlfriend and I both chose coleslaw for our sides. We probably could have got a different side and shared. The sloppy joe sandwich was alright. The service was good when we were giving our orders, but after that it wasn't very attentive; we had empty cups for the majority of our dinner. All that being said, we liked it and will probably be back for more fried chicken because we're fat."}
{"text":"Food was good, but you're paying mostly for location.  I got a $14 burger which, although I enjoyed, wasn't anything special.  What really threw me off was being charged extra for each basic item on my burger: tomato, lettuce and onion.  At $14 a burger, you gotta be pretty cheap to charge extra for those.  Otherwise the burger only came with pickles....  Service itself was quite good - our waiter was great."}
{"text":"This place has everything I want from what I would call an upscale diner; comfort food (including some all day breakfast items), fast and friendly service, good music, and of course a relaxed atmosphere.   My friend and I stopped into White Brick for a quick early dinner before heading to a class at Annex Improv around the corner. We arrived well before any kind of dinner rush (around 4:30) and needed to be in and out in about 40 mins, so asked the server if that was doable. \"Absolutely\", she said. \"Awesome\", we said.   We made our decisions - mac and cheese for my friend and rarebit with a side of mashed potatoes for me, and a side spinach salad to share - and they arrived within I'd say 10-15 mins. Everything was delicious. Both our dishes featured a tangy creamy cheese sauce, the side mashed potatoes tasted like homemade in the best way, and the simple salad with its lightly acidic vinaigrette was the perfect thing to cut through all the carbs and dairy we were consuming.   STUFFED, but satisfied, we happy campers were done and out the door in under 40 mins.  Suffice it to say: I'll be back."}
{"text":"Note: I've only ever had the fried chicken here and only as takeout.  IMO, its the best chicken meal in the city. It tastes pretty much like Stockyards but the key difference is the sides. The scallion biscuits and red pepper jelly is my favourite part of the meal. And Stockyards fries have always been too burnt and small, while these are bigger (although still not as crispy as I'd like). Doesn't come with coleslaw or hot sauce (although I feel like Stockyards' sauces just taste too acidic)."}
{"text":"Cozy place, delicious food and great service. We had a great time and the service was efficient. Brunch recommended"}
{"text":"First timer at this restaurant.  - got there at 10:45 on Sunday for Brunch (waited 20 mins) - we ordered the scotch-ish eggs, blueberry cheesecake waffle, the eggs Benedict and side of sausage * scotch-ish eggs was simple and light even though the eggs were deep fried  *blueberry cheesecake waffle was delicious even if you don't have a sweet tooth. Waffle was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The sauce was creamy, sweet but on the mild side and the berries tasted fresh   *eggs benny was my less favourite - not because it didn't taste good it just wasn't anything special.  *I would skip the side sausage because it lacked flavour."}
{"text":"Decided to take a friend for lunch after reading the reviews.  Made reservations, fairly easy and got a booth. Now given it was a weekday lunch,  wanted to keep it fairly light,  but tempted to try the signature chicken dish for $18 + $2 to add a sauce. It came with fries that were very dark  (burnt ) and the chicken was battered bigtime like popeyes but fried alot longer then..I think they have coffee in the seasoning to make it look dark but moist on the inside.  The sauce is a sweet sauce not a hot sauce, so not sure why they say make it hot for $2..lol. It's not the best chicken in Toronto by the way:) As for the $11 breakfast for 2 eggs, 2 tiny sage sausage squares, home fries covered in seasoning and toast?  Really guys?  This dish was not gourmet at all, Boom Breakfast puts out a better spread than that!  Service : the server seemed like a nice guy. .but too bad he was handling the entire restaurant alone during lunch? Not sure if that's good customer service as he was totally burnt out. Anyhow, I think three stars is generous - but creativity deserves one!"}
{"text":"Brunch is my favourite meal, so I'm a little biased. But seriously, for adventurous brunchies out there, it doesn't get much better than \"char siu eggs benny!\" Yep - you read that right!  Char siu benedict. Pickled cucumbers on a scotch bap with blue potato kimchi salad - delicious does not do it justice.  And for the less adventurous, they have the standard eggs, bacon, home fries as well to satisfy your brunch cravings.  Everything is reasonably-priced, the noise-level is buzzing but still conducive to talking and they've a patio, yay!   Took a star off because: 1) Iced coffee was too watery 2) We had to wait forever for our bill. We were sitting in the back so I think our waitress eventually forgot about us. Not a big deal as we were having a good time, but had to wait about 10-15 mins."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to hit this brick house for quite some time now, but I just couldn't make it work.   Cut to sitting in nearby Northwood and feeling starving. My colleague and I were both squirming from hunger pangs, but it was a little too hot out for Korean and we were hoping for a patio.   \"White Brick Kitchen!\" I shouted, and off we scurried.   We grabbed a seat on their patio, and ordered. The entire menu looked pretty perfect, and I can't wait to return for their macaroni and cheese! I had the club add cheese with their house greens and it was great. Sage butter mayo stuff on the bread really made it pop. My buddy had a burger, and it looked grilled to perfection, thick and juicy... just like a brick house."}
{"text":"BOOM!  Fried Chicken.  Wow.  Colonel Sanders can eat his heart out.  This was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  We made a reservation.  This place is small, but the service is fantastic, smelled like heaven.  I highly suggest it.  I will be heading back with some of my other friends.  Like the other reviews... the menu is small, the place is small... but they do it right!!    Congrats to White Brick!  Well done."}
