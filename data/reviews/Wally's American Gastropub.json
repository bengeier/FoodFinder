{"text":"Went to Wally's last night and all I can say is YIKES!!!!! The biggest disappointment I've experienced in a long time. What used to be this hidden gem, with the comfort of home vibe with perfectly cooked home cooked food and staff that treated you like family has now become just like every other restaurant in Scottsdale. Way over priced for poor quality of food, staff that doesn't care anymore, management that doesn't care anymore. My favorite waitress is gone, which I guess is no surprise seeing what the owner Chris did to this place. If I wanted to eat at Grassroots or Twisted Grove then I would drive a few blocks down and eat there. Wally's was something amazing, something special that is so hard to find in a restaurant these days.Now, it's ruined, now is disgusting, now it's a complete waste of your time and hard earned money. Don't bother trying it out, trust me. I will not be back to this one. I would much rather drive to the other location on Camelback that has remained the old Wally's. Way worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot, I've been coming here for years for lunch.  Chris has definitely added his touches to the new menu and the Cobb salad is awesome!  Always relaxed spot with friendly staff...be sure to see Angie at the bar for a green tea (or beer or cocktail) and always a smile!  Nice big comfortable patio as well."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  New owner means new trendy (read: small portions and fancy ingredients) Scottsdale food. No more French onion soup, no more fried chicken and biscuits. Forget about what has become of the formerly famous Wally's wings. The new version is smaller, with oddly sweet bbq sauce. California Cobb salad had tasteless Bleu cheese dressing, miniscule amounts of bacon and barely any avocado at all. Chicken Caesar had overpowering anchovy dressing and parmesan cheese that tasted like it came out of a Kraft can. Manager was nice and offered us dessert, but didn't make up for my disappointment. If I want trendy Scottdale fare, I will go to the new owner's other places, Grassroots or Twisted Grove both of which are far better than Wally's. I will not be going back...ever."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Wally's in a long time, I didn't know they had made so many changes until I walked in, but I was so pleasantly surprised. The updates to the menu, drinks and the space make it feel much more current and it is just what I am looking for in a neighborhood spot. We shared the salmon and the Caesar salad a I can't wait to go back and try more. I am especially excited to check out the happy hour."}
{"text":"Go here quite often for lunch.  Today we went and was very disappointed in the new menu. No french onion soup, cobb salad was not as good as they used to be, chicken was dry. If it isn't broken you shouldn't fix it. At least not all at once. Also gone is the creme brullee.  Very disappointed today. Thank goodness the outside eating area did not change."}
{"text":"Recently \"renovated\" actually means, \"We changed the tables and put new shutters on the windows, and removed most of the charm of what used to be one of my go to eateries.

What used to be a quaint bar and grill that featured some of the best of American comfort food is now something else. Gone is almost all of the former menu. Replaced with poor attempts at modernizing.

I asked about the items I used to love and was told \"they are still here, they are just slightly different.\" Gone was the wonderful and simple Prime Rib Dip. Replaced with a tri tip sandwhich whose horseradish sauce is still lingering in the back of my mouth like guest who just wouldn't leave. 

The couple at the table next to me put it best when they said, \"I love that they updated the decor, but did they have to get rid of the old menu and the Wally's that I loved.\"

It's sad, but after eating here several times a month for many years, I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband was craving prime rib and when he did a search Wally's came up. We called as we didn't see it on the menu and we were told on Friday's and Saturday's they serve prime rib. 

This place is quite the find. Excellent service and atmosphere. My husband had the prime rib which was amazing. I had the meatball and spinach pasta which had amazing flavor.  We also had the half dozen peel and eat shrimp. Some of the best peel and eat shrimp I have ever had in Arizona. It's a meal in itself!"}
{"text":"Last ate there one year ago.  During this time it must have changed hands.  Both the food and service have suffered.  Won't be back.  Many better options for the money."}
{"text":"We've been going there since they opened many times a month.  I find the new menu very hard to read with light print and poor lighting. Like other reviews the food that Wallys was known for is gone. Replaced with trendy bad items. The wings have changed they are either fried and soggy or grilled and rubbery dripping in BBQ sauce.  Gone are all the burgers that they were known for and the daily specials.  I was raised to say if you can't say anything good about someone or something don't say anything. So good luck to the wonderful we will miss your greetings and smiles."}
{"text":"Went back to Wally's after a brief hiatus and was completely shocked that Chrissy and Angie are both back! We were really worried about the menu change since we LOVED their other food, but I have to say that we were all pleasantly surprised! So on top of having our favorite servers/bartenders around again, we will be joining them for more than beverages (mocktails for me of course since I'm preggo). We ended up with a group of about 10 and everyone was extremely happy with their meal. My mom has a lot of food allergies and it was so helpful that just about everything is made in house. Our server, by the way, was patient and understanding. She made sure to follow up on everything making Mom feel very grateful (this isn't how most servers react to her 20 menu questions). One friend of mine ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwich and devoured it. The fries were so delicious and crispy! Another friend got the BBQ Salmon and it was amazing! He totally loved it. Let's be real - when you order fish in AZ you never know what you could be getting, but this salmon was fresh and delicious! Just the right amount of food to not leave you feeling stuffed, but you definitely won't be hungry when you leave either. I ordered the Bistro Insalata and substituted the sopressata for chicken - Yum! I'll probably order the dressing on the side next time since it had a little more than I would have liked, but I really can't complain since I ate the entire thing (and it was BIG). My aunt ordered the Portabello Sandwich and said it was awesome. She said it was filling and that she would definitely order it again. There are also a few new servers there and everyone was SO friendly. We loved the new decor - it still has the upscale pub vibe, but it's been freshened up a little. We will definitely be back soon to try more new menu items and of course to see Chrissy and Angie!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Wally's in a while and glad to have 're-discovered' it.  Made a reservation for a Saturday night & good thing as the place was packed.

Food was great, service was excellent.  Hate when the main arrives as you are taking your first bite of salad and that did not happen here; pacing of the meal was great.  The patio is the spot to be as inside seems noisy and crowded.

We caught the last 15 minutes of happy hour and you can't beat a $7 glass of good wine.  All in all a great experience warranting a return trip."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to try the new menu at Wallys and it did not disappoint! All I've read is all the favorites are gone, to my surprise most my favorites were still there, along with some new exciting options.  Thanks for a great meal, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic lunch!  I had the French Dip (a Saturday special) with cole slaw on the side and my wife had the meatloaf with horseradish mash potatoes...then we shared the BEST coconut cream pie we've ever had anywhere.  Everything was truly amazing...my sandwich, recommended by our server, was mouth-watering with a side of house-made cole slaw and my wife's plate of meatloaf & potatoes was lick-the-plate wonderful.  But the finishing touch was that unforgettable coconut cream pie which was to-die-for.

5+ stars for Wally's American Gastropub!  Great food & great service at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This had one of the best hamburgers I have had in awhile.  Started off with French onion soup, one of my favorite soups and they did not disappoint.  The hamburger came the way that I requested and shoestring French fries, they were hot, fresh and addicting!  I will stop in here more often as they had some other items on the menu that I want to try.  If you want a good meal at a descent price you must stop in."}
{"text":"I use to love this place until they changed and limited the menu. No more 4 cheese mac and cheese. No more French dip. No more Mike W. My wife and I walked out."}
{"text":"My son and I found this gem on open table. We were welcomed by a lovely server who made our visit very enjoyable! We started with the artichoke appetizer and finished with the meatball sub meal and fish and chips. We also had the brownie for dessert. We will be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I had the burger with sweet potato fries the burger was great and cooked just right I was unhappy that they only gave me less then a handful of fries. But the other ppl I was with had regular fries and it filled their plates. Didn't quite understand that. Other then that great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Really like this bar and the staff. They make tasty drinks with proper pours and the food is delicious. Great happy hour, I recommend the burger and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. Super tasty!! Keep up the great job guys!"}
{"text":"I told the Manager, Joseph, to have Christopher contact me.. but he hung up on me.....Joseph said it was not his problem,,, isn't he the Owner??"}
{"text":"We come here all the time. We usually just sit at the bar but the dining areas are very nice too. And the patio is large and very nice.\" Happy hour here is great. We always get the peel and eat shrimp. They are large and not overdone! The bartenders are all amazing and very nice!"}
{"text":"The service is great! Its a fun friendly atmosphere. I love going to unwind and have a great time!"}
{"text":"We are from Kingman, we have a home in Scottsdale, we come down at least twice a month. We ALWAYS eat at one of Cris Collins restaurants every time we are here. Ate at Twisted Grove last night, all his restaurants are always so good , the help is wonderful. 
Kyla is taking over as manager at Wallys on doubletree, she is wonderful. Wish they would offer the old spaghetti and meat balls, love the Mac and cheese, take ten of them and old spaghetti back to Kingman frozen. Old customers can make suggestions to Cris , sure he will consider bringing back some favorites, we love all his restaurants, can't wait for the new twisted grove by the Biltmore on Camelback !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience ! Great people and awesome meals! Cannot get enough of this place....probably why I'm in here so often. The staff makes you feel like family. Highly recommend Wallys !"}
{"text":"Good Restaurant, fun place to go on Friday evening. I just ordered the wrong thing. Wife ordered Red Snapper and was completely satisfied. I ordered the Prime Rib and it was tough and medium rare was under cooked. It was cold and I should have sent it back but was really hungry. I noticed several orders of ribs that looked delicious. Not that many people ordering the Prime Rib.
So disappointing to pay $30.00 for a 12 oz piece of meat and have it not good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to frequent this place and recently dropped by for dinner. To my surprise, they had changed the menu. I was really looking forward to the prime rib dip and sadly, it was removed from the menu. Definitely was my favorite French Dip in town (boyfriend likes Houston's more). The place has been modernized but that was the one item we got every time we came. I decided to give the tri tip sandwich a try... 

It was good but nothing great. We go to Grassroots and Twisted Grove a lot so Wally's just seems to be another location. I wish they had kept more of the menu. Forgot to mention that the Turkey Pastrami & Pretzel Bun was delicious - not sure if they kept it. The French dip at Twisted Grove is different. Good but not the same as he one that was at Wally's. Glad they kept the bread pudding because that was my favorite dessert there. As much as I do like some of the new menu items, they are just items from the other restaurants Chris owns. I guess if we want a quiet place with the same menu items as Twisted Grove and Grassroots we'll come here. Food and service is always good. 

Just needs a few items brought back!"}
{"text":"After seeing Chef Christopher on tv (AZfamily) I couldn't wait to try his Black Bean Veggie Burger. Just recently moved to the area from PA. We were welcomed by Chef Christopher and wonderful waitress, Aynsley. The food was excellent and I especially loved the sautéed onions on top of my veggie burger and delicious sweet potato fries! For desert we enjoyed the brownie with caramel sea salt ice cream. It was definitely the best lunch since moving to Scottsdale and looking forward to returning..."}
{"text":"Fellow vegans,  I'm afraid this restaurant does not welcome us here.  There are no choices besides French fries.  

Our server was amazing though.  She said she was vegetarian and tried vegan so I knew I could trust her to help me.  I gave her some guardrails (nothing fried, more than a salad) and asked her to work with the kitchen to prepare something I could eat. 

She did wonderfully! She brought me a portobello mushroom \"burger\" on a lettuce bun with tomatoes and onions.  One the side they made and enormous portion of steamed spinach.  It was amazing. 

Wally's: you need to fix your menu.  Or at least have some options on hand.  For instance,  some dried pasta with no egg.  You could modify your veggie burger recipe to use a binder besides egg and how about a bun other than brioche?  

If I'm on my own,  I have a choice where to eat,  and it wouldn't be here. In this case I was with a group.  Your menu makes it awkward for a plant-based person to order. Thank goodness for the wonderful sever that helped me through it."}
{"text":"Wally's has the best prime rib around, cooked to perfection and the artichoke side dish was delish! It's always a pleasure dining at Wally's, exceptional food, waitstaff and ambiance! I've been a customer for years and I'll definitely be back. Thank you, Adam and waitstaff."}
{"text":"This is probably the hugest disappointment in restaurants for the McCormick Ranch area. Wallys has been our \"Go-To\" restaurant for at least 8 years. We have always enjoyed the casual neighborhood atmosphere and comfort food of \"Moms home cooking\" feel! With the change of ownership-it is no longer the \"Wallys\" we loved! We gave it a second try Friday evening, but much to our disappointment-we were further discouraged. My husband ordered \"The Company Burger\" and asked for it medium rare. The waiter informed us that due to the thickness of the burger-the most he could get was medium. We felt like we were at Applebee's! He chose something else.
I understand now why \"Village Tavern\" has maintained their success for 20 plus years-they have stayed true to their roots, and not become something that they are not. If I wanted \"Grass Roots\" menu and feel-I can go a mile down the road!"}
{"text":"We come here from time to time. We have friend who like this place. Food has always been good and it was today. We were here for happy hour and chose coming here over the place we started out for because we remembered this place when we drove by. Food is only part of the dining experience.  Our waiter was nice and seemed competent. I had ordered a martini which he had just delivered and he was eager for us to order. I resisted because I feared the food would arrive as I was sipping my cocktail. I agreed to order but told him I didn't want the food until the martini was finished.  Needless to say, food was delivered when my martini still had 1/3 left. I complained but my wife's meal was there as well as mine. Ten minutes later he had a revelation and came to me to explain that he now realized I wanted to finish my martini and get my wine before my food arrived. I ate my cold sliders and they were still good. I won't order food until my martini is finished next time...and there will be a next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have considered the Scottsdale location to be a favorite for dinner and/or happy hour for years.  The fact that it's close to home was also a bonus.   We don't care for the \"new\" concept or menu - to many favorites are missing and the replacements are lacking.  So much of the many unique and wonderful things that made Wally's \"Wally's\" are missing!  We've tried several times and the great Wally's vibe just isn't there.  If we wanted Grassroots or Twisted Grove, that's where we would have headed.  Unfortunately, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible food - great service . We ate there for years as Wally's . The new menu is terrible . A classic example of ruining a great thing . A slab (1/2 1nch thick ) of frozen halibut and a glob of sautéed spinach smothered in too much parmesan on a large white plate for $27.00 . A lovely fusion salad with chunks of TOUGH tri-tip . We will never go back . Hope the great staff find another place to work ."}
{"text":"First time hear Ford happy hour and enjoying the laid back atmosphere. Great deals on the grilled cheese and TriTip sliders. Both are highly recommended.  Griddle cheese is only $4 and you get two full sandwiches with a cup of soup. For those looking for a drink try the pineapple infused vodka drinks."}
{"text":"Great place....great owner, Chris, and Angie behind the bar is worth the visit....staff always does excellent service....food is always primo...new menu is fun and excellent food....I visit weekly."}
{"text":"A great pub for lunch meetings.  Enjoy the climate controlled patio,  and be sure to check out the daily specials.  Tuesday tots day is my personal favorite.  The chicken parmesan is served on a bed of homemade noodles, add extra red pepper flakes if you dare."}
{"text":"Wally's is SO good! I had always seen this restaurant on my way to my boyfriend's house, and when I found out it was one of the Common Grounds Culinary restaurants, I definitely wanted to check it out. Kinda funny, when we actually headed over the the restaurant, I realized what I had been seeing was a random, different place called Wally's... good thing we decided against just meeting each other there, cause I would have shown up at the wrong place lol. 

Anyway, we decided to get cocktails, because they sounded really good. He got the Wally's Old Fashioned, and I got the Island Fizz - if I'm not drinking beer, I usually go for rum or sparkling wine, so this was perfect for me. It was delicious! I did a ~summer of rum~ this year (lol), so I've tried a lot of different rum drinks recently, and this was one that stuck out to me. 

Then, we decided to split the Salt & Pepper Crispy Calamari and Fish & Chips for dinner. The calamari was great, but what we really liked was the San Marzano red sauce it came with. It was amazing - normally I'm not a fan of the sauces restaurants serve with calamari, but I loved it. It was kind of like a marinara sauce with a hint of cheese, but with a twist that made it perfect for calamari. 

The Fish & Chips were great as well! They were well-seasoned and the crust was crispy, and not too thick or greasy. I loved the fries, too. And the Collins' Slaw it came with was above average, too - it tasted like it had kale or something in it. I don't normally like kale, but this tasted great! Again though, it was the sauce that made it special. It was tartar sauce with more of a ranch-like consistency. It was tangy and yummy, and there was something different about it that made it really good. 

For dessert, we had the Ghirardelli Brownie, which comes with caramel sauce and sea salt ice cream. This was delicious too; not as above average as the food, but still great. They give you one giant brownie though, and for $7, I think you get your money's worth. :)

We are 100% going to come back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Love the changes to the menu at this Wally's location: great variety! Happy hour is a great deal with a nice range of savory snacks such as the pretzel fondue or the sliders. Don't miss the delicious brownie for dessert! Waitstaff is gracious and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing service as always and the S'mac's never disappoint!! The bacon one is my all time favorite."}
{"text":"Wally's is a sister restaurant to Grass roots and twisted grove. Bobby our server informed us they all use the same home made pasta which was in my Bourbon Street pasta with chicken and andouille sausage. BTW is was amazing!  I don't normally eat pasta due to the high carb count but this dish was worth the exception. I am a sucker for anything hot and spicy, add a nice cream sauce to cut the heat and you have a great dish. 

Wife had the braised short ribs pot roast on garlic mashed potatoes. I get the leftovers for lunch can't wait. 

We had not visited Wally's in awhile the menu had lots of new items which we are very excited to go back and try. If your looking for a place off the beaten path in McCormick range area give it a try. Reasonable prices, great drinks, low background music and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting. Menu had so many great choices, I had a hard time deciding. Ended up getting the special which was prime rib. Meat was very juicy and tender. Food came out fast. Our servers name was Ainsley and she was very attentive. Excellent service. Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Our first experience with Wally's, the worst experience I've ever experienced, I ordered Chicken Parm, the chicken was so tough, I couldn't even cut it let alone try to chew it, not high on my recommendation list."}
{"text":"Lousy service when it was not busy on a Sunday night. Walked out before the dinner arrived because of the awful service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Had the tacos and the happy hour cheese plate. Love the new menu, can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Last night was the second time we have visited Wally's over the past month. I thought I had written a review after the first visit, but it turns out I must have forgotten. This food here is so delicious! To sum it up. Collectively between both visits, we have had the prime rib, pasta with spinach meatballs, halibut, calamari, wings, cajun pasta and of course the peel and eat shrimp. Which are some of the largest and tasty shrimp I have ever had.  Everything we have tried has been fresh and yummy. Staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is great.  Can't wait to go back and try the burger that the women seated next to us were eating, it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"It is a cool nice clean place with pretty good food. Everyone was happy, except my wife got some chicken piccata that was a little dry. Based on everything else at the table, probably just a oversight. everyone is allowed to make a mistake sometime. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just another neighborhood place with nothing redeeming about it. Not much to enjoy. A real eh."}
{"text":"We ate here last week and noticed lots of changes.
The menu has been changed- fewer options.
I got the feeling, the staff was wishing they were anyplace else but there.
Not a good feeling of welcome. Just to be clear- they were the hosts and if they want us to return any time soon, they better have an attitude review with their staff.
 I had a hamburger with parsleyd fries.
That little burger - well, was very small and looked like the fries were counted out, one by one....
Lovely patio - great location but those 2 things alone, do not keep a restaurant vital.
I think new ownership Needs to rethink their restaurant tweaks.
In this highly competitive restaurant scene, I'm inclined to spend my money where the food is memorable( in a good way), and I am treated like a valued consumer."}
{"text":"We love this place for date nights! Lucinda our bartender is always a delight to chat with. Great happy hour if you're looking for something before dinner."}
{"text":"What a great place! Great food, nice atmosphere and our server Aynsley was great and so nice!"}
{"text":"First time here & we are big fans of grassroots. Loved the atmosphere, service & of course food !! Ribs were a 10 & trout was delicious!! The artichoke app was one of the best we've had w the remoulade sauce ! Can't wait to return !!"}
{"text":"1. if you change your menu, post it new menu on your website
2. If you change your menu why to you take off all the great, yummy and according to my server popular items? 
3. Seriously-  because you own two other restaurants that do not serve Pinot Grigio (which is one on many reasons i don't go) you have to take over this one and remove a popular wine. 
4. you blew it - with me and other....now it's Pomo, Alma, Drexel or all the other options.
5. Not all change is good"}
{"text":"Classic pub menu -burger,sandwich,appetizers- but everythings homemade. I am not a burger person but it was great. Also tried a veggie burger and it was surprisingly pleasant. Burger mac and cheese was okay. Waiter and overall service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here on Easter Sunday with the family at 4p. Happy Hour was still in play. Most restaurants exclude holidays. The food and service was excellent. We will all be back again. Great place!"}
{"text":"First time at wallys!, nice ambience, good service, 
Food was great, ordered a few items on the happy hour list, food was great But COLD!!!
Unfortunately would not go here again!
And for the comment i got regarding this review, no i was not drunk!! Yes the food was good but served Hot or even warm would have been Better!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place relaxed and fun...older crowd great food and menu."}
{"text":"My husband I come here on a regular basis for weeknight dinners or to grab an early Sunday night dinner. The menu was updated a couple weeks ago- they still have all of our favorites (delish mac n cheese varieties) but now they also have a lot of our favorites from Grassroots and Twisted Grove (baby back ribs available everyday now!).  The service here is great- they make you feel like part of the family- whether sitting at the bar or dining on the patio, we've always had a great experience. Love the refreshed menu options! I recommend trying the citrus mule (like a moscow mule with a twist) :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in the other night after a long work week.  We definitely didn't \"fit in\" as we were under 50 yrs old.  But, we figured... why not give it a shot!?


We thought it was a bit odd when the hostess said that the entire place was full and that it would be a 20 minute wait.  For a Friday night, we didn't think that was too bad.  But then we looked around.  There were two empty tables, already prepped and ready to go.  There was one large party that just left, and two more smaller ones headed out the door.  No one was waiting outside either.  Sooo... why are we waiting 20 min again???

We asked if we could just sit at the bar and that was no problem.

The bartender quickly hustled to clear the previous guests dishes and set us up with a couple menus and drinks.

My wife had the meatball sandwich and I had the ribs.  The sandwich looked a bit dry when it arrived, but had an extra side of sauce.  It had great flavor and was a good portion size for my wife.  My ribs were packed with flavor and fell right off the bone like the menu said they would.  Shoe-string fries came with both meals and came out great!  Love those damn fries!!!

The bartender was very pleasant, quick to response, attentive at the right times.  Overall, a very good experience.  We shall return...  :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  We really enjoyed our lunch!  Our server Ryan was very attentive.  The manager, Chad, came to our table to make sure everything was good and wished our kids a happy birthday.  We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great value on happy hour! Grilled cheese and tomato bisque comfort food $4 and I took half of it home it was so much food. Wally's has always had the the best BLT wedge salad and it still does. Service was warm, friendly and helpful (thx Caitlyn!). Wonderful neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant with excellent pub food & drinks. The fried chicken special is to die for!"}
{"text":"The three of us had a GREAT lunch. Service and food was incredible.  Meatball sandwich was awesome, marinara was best I ever had. California Cobb was excellent,  not your typical salad.....Strongly recommend visiting, happy hour is a killer as well....."}
{"text":"The best food, reasonability price and a great atmosphere indoors and out.  Great lunch specials and always a hot spot in the evening and happy hour."}
{"text":"Went back to this place since I read they are now owned by the guy who owns Grass roots, which I like. Much better experience this time. Freshened up the menu. Had one of the best wedge salads I have ever had. I like lots of dressing and it did not disappoint. The tri-tip sliders were great and on happy hour menu. Attentive service a plus."}
{"text":"Very bland salads ...I had the California Cobb with hard boiled eggs that tasted like rubber and the yolks were hard...my friend had another type of salad and like mine was drowned in dressing with fried onions on top ????? We have had better salads at Denny's...highly overrated...if you want Dads menu and bland food this is your place. The service was the only thing that kept this from being 2 stars.....nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Love Wally's. Tried them for the first time today. Delicious food and perfect service. Love the atmosphere. Prices were reasonable. Can't wait to go back here again. A++"}
{"text":"I tried to like the \"new Wally's\". I've been a regular for years.  I tried numerous times, but last night was the last. Menu change can be good, but not in this case - most of my favorites are gone but more importantly, quality of the food is nowhere near what it used to be. The prime rib, which used to be among the best in Scottsdale, was lacking in flavor and tough - not even recognizable from its former self. Fish and chips lacked the freshness of the former Wally's.  Miss the French dip and strawberry salad. Friday nights used to be packed at Wally's - bad sign last night when there was no wait and the place was fairly empty.  I will miss this place."}
{"text":"My Mom, Dad have been going to Wally's since it opened. When we moved here from NY, we loved it!. My Mom and I just went there for lunch about 5 months ago. The menu changed. We were so disappointed the Wally Wine Burger was gone, the menu changed. We got up and walked out. there was absolutely nothing on the small menu that we wanted. Too Bad let us know when the Wally Wine Burger is added back. And change your menu on line"}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant, I can't wait to go back...maybe even tomorrow night....if i could give it a 10 I would...service was so friendly and food was beyond excellent...my favorite place in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I are here with my Mom and Dad while down for a visit.  The food was good and reasonably priced.  Our waitress Hannah was very nice and attentive, as were all the other people working there.  Hannah made good recommendations, I had a salad with blackened shrimp, it was delicious and nice size portion.  Mom had tri tip sandwich, looked great.  Dad had Danish ribs, he loved them.  My parents are getting up there in age and they were very patient and kind with them.  

Nice spot for an easy going dinner.  It's not the fanciest or hippest place, but it is an overall great spot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Angie was incredible and super attentive throughout our entire experience. The menu had so many options that varied in flavor and style. The common ground mozzarella was on point and so was the grilled cheese and tomato soup and the bistro insalata was phenomenal! I had a piece of the coconut cream pie for desert and it was so delicious I decided to order a full pie \"to go\" for my nephew's birthday party. I have been here once before and had the crispy chicken sandwich, which was also to die for! The Collins family sure knows how to cater to the quality tastes of this neighborhood and town!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I've had the fish and I've had the pasta and both are incredible. Specifically the bourbon street pasta, the handmade pappadelle pasta is unreal. Service was also great, the whole experience was perfect!! Go here!!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Corn Chowder in town!  Love the patio though the bar is 1st class!  Don't leave without dessert...coconut cream pie is their claim to fame."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's day Lunch with my wife and 2-month old son. The place was not as busy as you would think for Mother's Day, but we were here for lunch and not brunch, which is the norm.
We sat on the patio, which is nice and covered with misters that really help with the heat. The service could have been a tad bit faster when you see the number of guests compared to the number of employees, but not BAD.
We started with the Peel and Eat Shrimp that was amazing!!! You have to get them if you check this place out! Really!
I had the Chicken Tenders with Fries and my wife had the French Onion Soup and the Caesar Salad with Chicken.
All was great, the chicken tenders were great, the bbq sauce is spicy/sweet and the house fries are then and seasoned very well.
The French Onion was great, the cheese melted perfectly with the broth with a subtle but defining amount of salt. 
Only issue we had was that they did get my wife's salad wrong, they brought a beautiful Wedge Chicken Salad, but that's not what was ordered :( 
It was fixed very quickly but my food was brought out, so it was that awkward moment of do I start? Do I offer, what to do....don't want it to get cold...but its Mother's Day, Argh....
Overall, we will be back, I think you get the drift."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time in Wally's, and it definitely won't be my last. The atmosphere is cozy and friendly and the food was great. They're wine was delicious and they're food...even better. I sat at the bar and Lucinda provided excellent service and company. 

Ps. You can't pass up the coconut cream pie!"}
{"text":"While keeping much the same decor as the original Wally's on 44th St, this location manages to seem more spacious and light. The food is good quality pub grub. We split a wedge salad and short ribs. Both were good and the prices reasonable. Personally, I would go there anytime for soup and a salad. My wife, who is more into the meat part of a meal really loved those short ribs. Served, at our request, with extra asparagus instead of potatoes, the meat was succulent and the vegetables outstanding. And, yes, lots of extra. I had coffee, which was strong and properly bitter and served with cream not those plastic creamers. Our friends, who also ate salads but with chicken said their food, too, was very good. They also opted to share a brownie dessert, which looked all right, but they said was really good. Of course, they're the ones with sweet teeth. The service was professional but impersonal. The ambiance was noisy pub with televisions everywhere but not intrusive. Sports of course was the video menu du jour. At least they had the same station on on every monitor, which meant less head craning and distraction, especially as none of us are sports fans. One added plus, on the way out that had decent chocolate mints. Even though I try to avoid sugar, those have always been one of my favorite little things in restaurants."}
{"text":"I just have to change my four stars to five. You guys are so great. We called about a party of 7 and were told we could not make a reservation but you would make certain not to seat anyone at the big round table. You made good on that!  We had to get people to the airport so we were in a hurry, you made sure to give us plenty of time to catch our plane. All that and amazing food too. My new favorite place, two nights in a row! Good job."}
{"text":"As someone from out of town, it was truly a pleasure to find Wally's.

The food is fantastic, as is the atmosphere.

Our server Ryan was one of the best I have ever experienced. Two thumbs up to Ryan. 

Highly recommend Wally's. Hope Ryan is at the bar when you go.


Went back to Wally's last night.  Great food and fun was had by all.

Kyle, our server, made sure everyone had what they wanted and was extremely pleasant.

Cannot wait until I go back again."}
{"text":"Wally's has a great neighborhood vibe with high quality food.  The staff is extremely friendly and have a lot of tenure with the establishment.  

Their happy hour is very reasonably priced with great food options.  They don't skimp on the portions and ingredients are fresh. 

Highly recommend especially since the new additions to their menu."}
{"text":"Check new menu before going.  Also seems like half of the reviews overall are 5 stars and just fake from new users. 

As the previous yelper mentioned, there are lots of changes. The items he got have been there a long time. I don't know exactly what's \"new\" on the menu other than a number of favorites disappearing. 

Why 2 stars?  Wife's salad with salmon was very good. My 3 favorite things were all gone so ended up ordering wings. They were edible. Breaded and fried but soggy. Nice sauce, though. Wings there had been great, especially for Phoenix, under the old guard. 

Businesses change things all the time. For me this was a bad one and I won't be returning. Always nice staff working and I hope they add more customers with the \"new\" menu and ownership than they lose."}
{"text":"This is a major improvement for the McCormick Ranch neighborhood! The changes to the menu and the high quality of ingredients are outstanding . They have kept the classics and added new improved twists. I will be back many times over."}
