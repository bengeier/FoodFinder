{"text":"Doesn't worth the drive for black forest cake.   I would compare this bakery to Chinese bakery in Markham (Cake One or Maxim) - they did use real cream, but expected chunky cherries  - instead I see cherry jam..."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time for their high tea since I live closeby.  Cute and quaint little place with rustic theme decor.  They offer a few options for high tea platters, we picked the simplest option which comes with egg salad and cucumber finger sandwiches, scones with jam and whipped cream, and strawberries with whipped cream and a piece of Millefeulle/Napoleon.  It also comes with brewed coffee or choose from their selection of teas.  The food tastes excellent and very fresh!  Portion is small but that's to be expected of high tea.  We also each had a slice of cake, which is what they are known for.  They had a large selection to choose from, I had their raspberry chocolate mousse cake and my sister had their sugar free chocolate mousse.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Not too sweet and oh so light! Soo good.  Unfortunately due to some miscommunication with a new waitress there we didn't find out that they are not Part of the high tea until we pay.    Overall we will definitely come back again to taste more of their cakes :) Really happy that it is so close to my home so can come back more often now!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastries and cakes. Great service."}
{"text":"Only dropped by for a cup of cappuccino.  Without any exaggeration it was the worst I have had.  It was more like a Timmies coffee.   Otherwise, a really cozy and old fashion cafe which is nice and their dessert looks delicious."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the cafe itself because it has been over 8 yrs since I've visited the place, however I recently tried their strawberry meringue cake. Compared to Maxim and Lucculas, I found it had too much cream and not enough meringue, there really was only crumbled meringue on the sides of the cake. It was ok, but not the best. However, the cake was fresh and it's good cream."}
{"text":"My fav desert place in Toronto!!! Great owners, friendly staff. They always have fresh baked cakes and pastry. All is natural and very tasty. They use fresh whipped cream and strawberries, good quality chocolate... They have different types if chocolate , coffee, pastry... You can also grab a lunch or breakfast..,  Love it!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The cakes are always fresh and the quality outstanding. If you have time for a light lunch, the sandwiches and soups are delist. Good, old-fashioned cooking. I especially like their split pea soup and the open-face shrimp salad sandwich. My favorite cakes are the strawberry meringue and, believe it or not, the sugar free diabetic chocolate mousse. I'm not diabetic but I order this cake because it is yummy! Doesn't have an aspartame taste at all. All you can taste is the high quality chocolate that they use. The service is also very good - friendly, fast and very courteous."}
{"text":"Blueberry cheese cake is the best I've had so far, rich in taste but not fatty or overwhelmingly sweet at all. You got to visit this hidden gem in the community!"}
{"text":"Favorite Strawberry Shortcake. Light cream with crunchy sugar. Strong recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent cakes and customer service which exceeded my expectations. The server attended to our needs and was very kind and gracious. Coffee was fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is very homey and cozy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for a quick little snack after a nice walk at Scarborough Bluffs. The server was very nice and courteous. She answered all of our questions and gave great suggestions. This cafe is original, quaint, and satisfying.  I had the apple crumble and my boyfriend had the hazelnut cake. They were not too sweet and delicious. We also had a large pot of tea to wash down the desserts. Would recommend for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Gerhard's Cafe by my coworkers because this place is within walking distance from work. We usually buy cakes here for special events and our staple is the strawberry meringue torte. I have adopted this tradition and buy this cake for special occasions when I'm feeling fancy.  The strawberry meringue torte has crushed meringue on the sides of the cake and there's a decadent middle layer of strawberry mousse. The cake is of course covered with whipped cream and decorated with strawberries on top.  I've tried some of their buttercream cakes and I don't have the same fondness for them. I'm not a fan of buttercream in general because it feels very thick as opposed to whipped cream which is more airy. They tell you to let the buttercream cake sit till it warms up to room temperature before eating, but it still doesn't hold a candle (no pun intended) to the strawberry meringue torte."}
{"text":"When you enter Gerhard's, you're greeted with display cases of home made cookies, tempting cakes and handmade European chocolate truffles. Place your order at the counter, have a seat (There are tables for 2s and two for 4s), and they'll bring your food to you. Decorated in granny chic with tea pots, doilys and hand crafted dolls on display (you can purchase the ones you like): you'll wonder if there is a little old lady in the kitchen whippin up somethin special just for you.   WE ORDERED: - California Turkey wrap was yummy. - Lentil soup was outstanding! It was flavored with curry and had bits of squash in it. - Ham and cheese quiche was light and creamy YUM! Best to eat them when they're just out of the oven in the morning. - Caesar salad side was ok. - Chocolate (mousse) Cheesecake was perfectly light with just the right amount of sweetness: a perfect way to end our meal. - Chocolate truffle sample - rich with decadent chocolate.   Simple, unpretentious food in a homey atmosphere with attentive service: this is my kind of place."}
{"text":"My friend's love this place and they took me here.   It's in a strip mall close to Scarborough town centre.   It's definitely quaint... and has a old world feel to it (ie. not modern or renovated) .    The food does kind of taste like eating at grandmas...simple, no frills, home cooking .     I had the spinach and ham quiche, it was well done but since it was microwaved to warm up it slightly stuck to the plate.  Still a nice slice of quiche with a standard Ceasar salad.    The quiche and salad was $9.99.   The roast beef on a kaiser at $7.99 looked fresh and balanced meat to bun ratio.      The desserts stand out.  The strawberry meringue cake was not very sweet at all, just enough to bring out the flavours....and actually quite nice.    My friends got the sugar free chocolate cake that was really a very mildly sweetened chocolate mousse in texture.  I normally shy away from sugar free products of any sort, but this was actually really great for a sugar free product, very creamy, great chocolate flavour, and wonderfully balanced.    Pretty much a diabetic's dream dessert.    The cake slices are about $5.50 a slice .      It's definitely not inexpensive for the location and decor, but if you enjoy a very unpretentious quite small cafe with old world uncomplicated food, you can get that in a sit down cafe at the price of takeout.     Also was wonderfully nice to kids and kid friendly, just call in first because they only have 1 table of 4.....the other tables all seat 2.     I didn't love it, but this place does have it's merits."}
{"text":"I have been to Gerhard's Cafe a handful of times, and have never had a bad experience. I've tried their mocha mousse cake, white chocolate mousse cake, custard danish, butter cookies, and apple cinnamon tea.   Price is a little steep, but totally worth it. The cake slices are roughly about $4.50/slice. I've picked up some clearance items a few times, where they sell day old cakes for $2.50. Although the cake was a little hard, since it was a day old, it was still delicious.   Don't even get me started on the custard danish. I've had a few custard danishes in my day, and this was by the far the best.   Along with the great dessert, the service is excellent. All of the workers are very friendly, and will come to your table every now and then to make sure everything is okay.   Great place for a little lunch, brunch, dessert or tea."}
{"text":"Came in today for desserts and paid $38 in total:  4 slices of cake at $5.50 each. 1 cake  at  $4.50 each (custard).  6 cookies at $1.20 each.  Like what other preview Yelpers have indicated, there are no prices/labels on these cakes or cookies.  Therefore, ordering can be expensive.     And, they are!  Nothing spectacular.  Slices are not huge to justify the $5.50 price!  Ambiance was \"old\" and not modern to rationalize the steep prices!  Cake slices at Metro for $2.75 are a better alternative!  I am starting to \"question\" some of these Yelpers' reviews; either they are too rich to afford these cake slices at $5.50 and not care about their quality or they are just too generous with their compliments.  I don't mind spending $5.50 or even $10/slice ....only if it warrants it.    Not in this case."}
{"text":"Gerhard's Cafe amazing.......however I was really thrown off when I entered. There were so many elderly ladies drinking tea! This must be their regular hangout spot or something and word must have spread that this is the place to be.  One thing that really disappointed me right from the get go was that there were no labels or prices for the desserts on display. There was only a sign at the door with some lunch options with sandwiches and soup. There was also no menu for drinks so I honestly felt like leaving right when I entered. Luckily I decided to stay otherwise I would have missed out on some amazing desserts.  Ordered the following:  Mochaccino $2.79 - nothing worth mentioning Mocha flavored cake $4.95 - not overly sweet, soft and pretty decent (3/5 stars) Almond cookie $1.75 - nothing worth mentioning Blue Berry Cheese cake $5.95 - AMAZING!!! - blue berries were very fresh, not overly sweet, great cheese flavor and perfect creamy texture (5/5 stars)  I saw another table have high tea with all sorts of little desserts. I really, really wish they had better labeling. Maybe I'm extremely blind or the other customers are regulars and know something that I don't but there is definitely something that I'm missing. I did not bother asking for a menu but instead ordered what I saw on display.   I will be back again for the cheese cake"}
{"text":"Classic decoration and a quiet place to have coffee and cake. Nice and friendly service. Decent dessert."}
{"text":"Ordered a large strawberry meringue? torte (cake) for a bridal shower. I wasn't sure what to have written on it so I said I'd call in. When I did, the person who answered the phone had a very hard time speaking/understanding English. I carefully went over what I wanted written, pretty much spelling it out (congratulations to the future mrs. ). The lady on the phone kept asking if I wanted a comma on the end and I kept saying no, put a period. Well I go pick up the cake, I should've checked it there but I was rushing to the shower...I get there and of course there's a comma lol. Not a huge deal as everyone loved it - it's a very delicious cake, but I wouldn't trust to call in another order if it's anything more than basic. Be very careful if you get someone on the phone as there are definite language barriers. When you pay over $100 for a cake I don't think there should be mistakes like this. I mean it is a display piece on the table after all, a pretty important piece at these types of functions."}
{"text":"CALLING ALL GERMAN COFFEE & CAKE LOVERS!!!   It's really in no mans land and not where it really should be.  It's tucked away in a little side place, but the cakes are SO good. Nowaday you get the articfial cakes with fake colors and taste.  This place has home made cakes with real whipped cream and real butter. It really does make a difference.  I used to get my birthday cakes here when I was young.  You can pre-order or sit in. There isn't much seating (roughly 10-15 tables) but it's not that busy anyways because I don't think a lot of people know about it.  But when you do stumble across this place - you WILL come back.  My favourite is Black Forest but they have a good variety like lemon, chocolate mouse, orange, cherry rum and so on..  If you live in Scarborough -- check it out some time :)   www.gerhards.ca"}
{"text":"I love the Gingerbread houses they sell here around Christmas. Always fresh and extremely tasty. With that being said the place is extremely small. The placement of the cash register is awful and the staff can be sassy at times. Pack your patience when you go here."}
{"text":"The hazelnut cake is great and not that sweet, the classic strawberry cake is much more popular than the hazelnut one but I prefer the hazelnut one cause it has almond topping!"}
{"text":"You walk into this \"off the beaten path\" place and instantly get the feeling of being in a warm and caring environment. The staff there are all kind and warm. It almost feels like eating at grandma's house. (If grandma was a great cook).   This place is known for is pasties and I understand why. I had the roast beef on a kaiser and I think it was the best one I've ever had bar none. I think it was even better than the cake dessert but that was still amazing too.   If you like pastries, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"We were in East Toronto in March of 2015 and 2016 for the Canadian Swimming Trials and in our search for a place where we could have good and healthy lunch, we found this gem. We've had soup and sandwich or quiche every day, and just loved it! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Gerhard's Cafe for sure is a breath of fresh air in Scarborough. I am so glad that this little cafe exist that serve simple lunch/brunch, decent coffee and choices of home made desserts.  Walking through the door of Gerhard's Cafe does makes me feel I am in a cafe somewhere in Europe.. ok the only thing they all speak English here.. :). First thing you see is the whole display case of chocolate.. then the next display case of cakes... and the next display case of cookies! Talking about sugary overdose! :P  You can have your sweet as a takeout and eat in. They do provide table services so you order from the counter and they will bring it to your table then you pay them on your way out at the cashier.  My silly question of \"Any cakes that taste good but not too sweet?\" was answered with a few helpful suggestions... Almost want to ask \"Any cakes the taste good but not fattening?\" The problem here is none of the cakes are labelled so it is a guessing game unless they look obvious..(blueberry cheesecake) Poor lady was bombarded with zillion questions until I decide on the White Chocolate Mousse Cake ($4.95) with a cappuncion ($2.45).  Try not to think they use real whipping cream, real butter and how much calories you consuming will be the wisest thing to do here. The Chocolate Mousse cake is really dense in texture and intense in favour.. as the lady point out real chocolate not powder was used in making the cake. The size here is really generous I could not really finish..  They do offer High Tea during the afternoon which for the photos on their website looks really elegant and traditional. Might have to come back for another trip for that!  They also offer lunch specials menu, but I would definitely recommend to try all their cakes and pastries instead.  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Went with my mom for a quick lunch as we were in the area. Tried the roast beef sandwich which was highly recommended by previous yelpers. For the money I thought there would be more meat but the bun was nice. Place was decked out like granny's living room. Good value for two lunches at just over 23 bucks. Desserts looked good."}
