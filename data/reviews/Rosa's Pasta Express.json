{"text":"I'm pregnant and I was craving pasta again, of course I would have gone to dominos and get pasta from there but I was looking for something else, my husband actually found this place, our first time going in. We get to the store we go in and the nicest people are there. We order the pasta and he tells us it's all homemade nothing from the can which in my opinion is always better. I am definitely coming back here!! I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"This place is relatively new and already the locals in the area are flocking to this place. 

I called the store to place my order and was told that basically you build your own pasta choosing the type of pasta, sauce and veggies. Meat options cost extra. They make it fresh to order.

I was kind of in a rush so I kept my order simple. Ordered 2 x Spaghetti with onions, mushrooms and ground beef (extra $1.99), one with ros√® sauce and the other with basil pesto.  

My order for 2 pastas were ready in 6 minutes! Along with 1 pop, the bill with tax came to $22. Not bad considering the generous portions and quick service. But the must important factor is that food taste great. Must say, another successful find!!!

I definitely recommend this place if you're in this area and craving comfort food."}
