{"text":"The slow-cooked lamb is killer."}
{"text":"Yummm!  I love Stoney's and have never had a meal I was not pleased with.  Servings are huge, but not impossible to finish (mainly because the food is so tasty, it's difficult not to keep eating).
I would definitely recommend Stoney's."}
{"text":"Absolutely superb sandwiches. It reminds me of Sandwich Box in Toronto for those who are aware of that place.

The production company I run/work for was shooting in the area and we had Stoney's cater it and it went over incredibly well. These things are heaven between a bun I tell you. 

It might seem expensive until you take that first bite, at which point you'll realize you're ripping them off."}
{"text":"We came here because the good reviews. My husband and me with two kids placed our orders and started our long waiting. It's Monday afternoon around 3:30pm with only few tables here. We got No 01 waiting card for our foods. But there was a young couple who came late then us and was holding No 02 card  but had their food earlier than us. After 20 mins, finally our food came, didn't taste liked.the reviews told. We oedered 1 burger, 1 soup, 1 pizza and 1 lamb panini. Stoney Burger($13) was dry and overcooked, mushroom pizza($15)was also dry and lacked flavors,  clam chowder($6) has too much wired dry herb in it. Only good thing was lamb panini($15),  but that was compared to other foods we ordered but not came with any sides.. We are really disappointed to chose eat here. With over $50, two adults and two kids  left with unfilled stomach. Service was slow, poor and no smile. The tips system was wired as well. They want you to tip first before you being seated and served. Won't come back anymore."}
{"text":"If I could have Stoney's everyday I would! Everything on the menu is amazing and the staff is so friendly and welcoming! I recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"The food here is really authentic and not over done. The place is inviting, and the staff very helpful.

I have tried the sandwiches, pizza and pasta.  I have also been here for brunch on Sundays ( brunch very busy, expect to wait, but food is only cooked after seating to ensure freshness).  Again, everything was flavourful, portion sizes hug, price is reflective of their portion, staff extremely friendly, changes to an item are handled with ease and a smile.

It is one of my top 10 casual fare restaurants any day.

I would highly recommend you go and taste for yourself, u will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I had good vibes upon entering Stoney's, the service  was friendly and I ordered the recommended open face blackened salmon .  I am sorry to say it was terrible and I couldn't eat it.  The dish was greasy, the bread soggy and the mixed greens too heavy with oil.  The chowder was disappointing and misleading.  Call it tomato soup with crab, it was served lukewarm. I had two bites and left.  It's a beautiful space but really noisy.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the flat iron steak salad. Good ingredients, generous serving. However the dressing was extremely oily. If there was any champagne vinegar, its flavour was completely subsumed by the oil. Also, they don't offer refills on the coffee, which is just plain stingy. Especially since it was pretty bleh, weak coffee, even the \"bold\" blend that I chose. As well, the service style (self serve, except for some inexplicable reason you have to wait to be seated) was awkward. You end up waiting to order and pay, waiting to get your drink, then waiting to be seated (it was almost empty when we visited).  Would like to give them another try because the food is good and the location is great, but the coffee miserliness might hold me back. Finally, no wifi."}
{"text":"Is it me or has Stoneys reduced portion sizes and increased prices?  This was one of my \"go to\" places but is slowly dropping off my radar screen."}
{"text":"I am torn about this place.  I like their food and that is why I continue to go back.  Portions are very generous and most dishes I enjoy very much.  Pizzas are good but my favorites are the sandwiches.  Yesterday I had the blackened chicken sandwich with avocado and goat cheese.

My issue here is that the service leaves much to be desired. To this day I don't understand if there is supposed to be a waiter in the dining area or not.  There is a sign that says \"Please wait to be seated\"...  What for?  Most of the time, nobody seats you; after that, nobody ever comes back to check on you.  

Also, why does the cashier handle food without gloves?  There should be some health regulation about this.  We would have talked to a manager but I think this place just runs itself, there is no manager here."}
{"text":"Still thinking about the slow roasted lamb sandwich I had today . First time at Stoney's and so glad I decided to go in for a late lunch. I missed the line-up (phew) because within 5 minutes of sitting, this place was packed. Service was very fast and friendly. We had to walk up to the counter, pay first, get a table number, get the drinks from the fridge and then sit...which was a little unusual lol When the waitress brought the sandwiches to our table we were amazed. It was soooo delicious, roast lamb to die for, so tender and juicy with sweet onion marmalade. Yum!! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Good quality food and very tasty - I really enjoyed my experience. The service was efficient but thoughtful even though the place was packed at lunchtime."}
{"text":"I've have become a regular over the last year or so, some restaurants usually tend to slip a little over time , this one has not...actually I think it has gotten better . They offer creative specials for a place like this , i usually go for those or the burger. My family loves the French toast for brunch , it's a little too much for me. I find the staff friendly and helpful , they really seem to care , a lot of the same staff has been there a while ....says a lot."}
{"text":"Great food, service not so great.  Food was top quality.   I ordered a pork loin sandwich with tomato confit.  Excellent.   A pint of Sleeman's was fine.  

Don't prepay your tip like I did.  I waited and waited for the food and the waitress seemed to forget about my table."}
{"text":"The food will not disappoint! It was better than expected. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was sooo good!! I will def be returning to try the other items on the menu for lunch and dinner.

I went on a very busy Sunday morning but the place was kept so clean! Can't wait to go back here!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Sandwiches! My only complaint is the acoustics. I use a hearing aid and can't have a conversation with my companion because of the noise. Too may hard surfaces. Still, I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm not the usual negative review giver but.....

After seeing the Oakville location on the Food Network, my wife and I were excited to see one open close by but were super disappointed in the place. The only redeeming quality this place had was a pretty nice interior. 

Where to start....

There's a kid's menu, but its not posted anywhere for some reason. After listening to the cashier stumble through what options there were for our 1.5 year old, we settled on the penne for him, a margherita pizza for myself and soup and salad for my wife.

The pizza was overcooked and tasted like it had a huge amount of poor quality cheese. The sauce was sickly sweet, a little heavy handed with sugar? 

The children's penne was brought in a huge bowl and for some reason, the restaurant had no children's utensils. 

My wife's salad was doused in oil and was 9 bucks for a huge plate of spring mix. Her soup had the same sweet taste as the tomato sauce.

Service was dreadful. When you have to walk around twice looking for someone to get you water, that's a pretty bad sign. When you have to ask multiple times for something (red pepper flakes), that's a bad sign as well. Also, note to our server; you can't say, \"I'm just going to put this down here\" when its a bowl of soup and you are putting it in front of a 1.5 year old.

Can't see how this place will stay in business. Artisano and Panera are waaaayyy better and cheaper options."}
{"text":"Love love love this place for breakfast lunch and dinner! 
Amazing, consistent, well portioned yummy food. Great staff and chefs. 
- If you come on a weekend breakfast time with more than 4 people, be prepared to wait 15 minutes+ for a table. 
- Pasta is only after 5pm, portion large enough for a hungry man. 
- Sandwiches are worth coming back again and again for."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat in Oakville."}
{"text":"I came from Mississauga on a stormy day. The trip was definitely worth it.  Shrimp and scallop fettuccine was really delicious. You can select smaller size salads but even the small was pretty big.  It was a nice cozy restaurant with self serving seating.  all the other foods from the other table look delicious as well.  I wish we can have a restaurant like this in Vancouver."}
{"text":"When you come across a great place, you want to tell others ... this place is GREAT! I'm a regular, and whenever I go, the place is crowded (always a good sign), and the food consistently terrific. You have to try the sandwiches first, and the egg dishes on the Sunday brunch are phenomenal ... but here's a tip for first timers .. order something to take away for another meal (pizzas are beauts) .. you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Lineup is long, especially for brunch. But the wait is ohhh sooo worth it. I can still remember when I bit into the slow roasted lamb sandwich. Juices flowing, perfect seasoning, amazing ciabatta bread. My friends ordered their actual brunch items which were a little less memorable, plus with the chaotic line up, I had no choice but to dock one stars. But, I still 100% recommend getting their sandwich. 

I don't know if I will ever find myself back in Oakville again, but if I do, I plan to inhale an entire pizza for myself."}
{"text":"I had the slow roasted lamb sandwich which was good. I personally don't like the process of waiting in line to order and pay, then sit down. Kinda feels like a Subway."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Pork sandwich was not my favorite. The reason I gave Stoney's a three star rating was because I didn't like the service system. You are paying and tipping at the register before you are getting your meal. When i asked a waitress for a take away container she said she would bring me one and never came back. I had to go ask for one at the counter. You are pretty much serving yourself to water and drinks. If I return, I will tip the waiter NOT the owner."}
{"text":"My wife and I originally passed on Stoney's from a quick call, asking if I needed a reservation. They said, \"no, its more first come first serve cafeteria style, but we bring the food to you.\".  Well, that threw us for a loop, but we decided to go the next night anyway.  

Good gracious, are we glad we did. We took my parents and my two daughters, 3 and 5. Everyone found something on the menu and were extremely comfortable in the environment the whole meal.  After coming in around 6:45 pm on a Saturday night, it looked packed and I thought we'd have to wait at least 15 minutes.  We waited 3 for a table.   Tables moved quickly, but I never had the feeling or pressure from the super friendly servers to eat quickly. We enjoyed our meal and by the time we left, we had all targeted out next choices on the menu. Except for my 3 year old...she will eat what I tell her to eat! :)

Wife had the goat cheese salad- great, I had the ny steak sandwich- awesome."}
{"text":"Hello Blackened Chicken Sandwich...why can't I resist you every time I visit Stoney's?
The food there is ridiculously amazing. Portions are very generous. Honestly, the only complaint I have is the seating. I want to give these guys a 5 but when I went there a few days ago and got up to go to the bathroom, I couldn't get back into my seat because someone sat on both ends of my table (without disturbing them and asking them to move of course). No, I'm not large, just expecting...ok so I guess I am large now...But, seriously if there are larger people or even someone who requires wheelchair accessibility then it may become a problem. It's always busy there and generally you can find a seat, but expect to be able to be a part of your neighbours conversation! Stoney's, your food is so excellent and your customer base is so large that it's time to upgrade to a bigger location. Nonetheless, if you want excellent pizza, salad, soup, or sandwich, please check them out."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at stoneys etobicoke.  Nice place, new decor modern and not too pretentious. Great spot for lunch although maybe not a dinner destination unless you want to pick up a quick bite before the movies.it's next to cineplex etobicoke and it's a great alternative to the milestones / Montana/kelsey clone restaurants there. Reasonably priced for what you get  and the menu has something for everyone.  Think upscale California sandwich. Hope it's lasts..the last two restaurants here didn't.  recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the food at Stoney's!  It's always so good with interesting menu items.  The atmosphere is very casual and warm which I like.  The only thing I don't like is how close the tables are to each other, when it gets busy it can feel a little claustrophobic..."}
{"text":"The bomb! They just need to fix their seating issues. Everything on the menu is amazing!"}
{"text":"2nd time there and still love this place!  Must go when you're in Oakville!  

1st time, we order something off the brunch menu.

This past Thursday when we were their for lunch, love their sandwiches, huge portion, had to bring half home.  

I just love the vibe of the place, always busy and full of energy!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. I have brought many people to this place and they all walk away with the same comments...delicious. Also wonderful, kind and patient servers. They are very accommodating with children even in tight spaces. A must go place."}
{"text":"Stoney's is a great place for gourmet sandwiches & does an amazing brunch.  Love the pulled pork and roasted lamb sandwiches.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place. They have lots of variety, great service and excellent food. We absolutely loved their blackened atlantic salmon with mango salsa! Will definitely go back for it."}
{"text":"Great place to go to get a quick bite. The set up is different from any other restaurant. You order your food at the cash, they provide you with a table number, then you choose any seat in the restaurant and wait for your food. The service is very quick and the staff is friendly and helpful. I had the balsamic chicken sandwich which was very tasty. It comes on a good quality focaccia type bread with bacon, pesto, spinach and a great sweet balsamic glaze. The serving size was very generous and I left full! I would definitely come back again to maybe try their pastas or breakfast. Overall good place to eat out."}
{"text":"Like most yelpers, i love Stoneys

Today I had my usual fav - Calabria sandwich - has chicken, roasted red peppers and goat cheese

I went with two co-workers who shared the Calabria and the back-bacon sandwich - each had half of one - I thought that was cute and a great way to try two sandwiches b/c narrowing it down to one is tough."}
{"text":"The food is good but their ordering and serving system is ridiculously inefficient. Like horrendous. They need to rethink it. As someone who has worked in cafes and restaurants I could name 100 ways they could improve the system.  I don't understand why they choose to do it this way. 
It's too stressful to eat there for the food to be worth it."}
{"text":"I have no clue what everyone is raving about. I went with  friend who heard it was good. I have only been once but I hated the order at the counter before you sit down idea, they do it a lot in London UK at cheaper places. I can also see that being a mess on busy days. 

While the menu sounded tasty, I ordered the Florence St. sandwich and a ceasar salad. Left two dollars in their tip jar, no drink, got my own tap water and that almost came out to $20.  I was shocked, for a place where you don't even get table service. 

The food came and the caesar salad wasn't very good, pretty tasteless, I have hadbetter at most chain restaurants. The sandwich was basically Chicken and lots of red pesto aioli, it was heavy because the amount of what tasted like loads of pink mayo. After eating it for a while I had to open it and check if the other toppings were even inside. The tomato, artichoke and rocket. There was one small piece of each.


My friend got the lamb sandwich and didn't really comment much when I asked her how it was, it seemed 'ok'.

I would maybe give the brunch a try but really there are so many great places out there and I'm kinda worried it'll sound good but be overpriced and disappointing when I get it.

The chicken was tender and staff was nice though."}
{"text":"Have been a regular at Stoney's for over 5 years, and not once have I ever left disappointed.  If I'm there for lunch or dinner, I usually opt for the Blackened Atlantic Salmon sandwich.  Crepes and French Toast are both solid choices for brunch -- you likely won't be able to finish either though since the portions are so generous."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the GTA for a weekend breakfast. The Stoney's Omelet and Santa Fe Eggs are two of my favourites. This place is always busy so get there early. Summer dinners on the street side patio are a great way to enjoy the warm weather."}
{"text":"The food has a lot of flavour and it is very fresh. Went here 6 months ago and I'll be back soon! The service was very good and the atmosphere was for all types for family, group of friends and for a date. Great discovery"}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and was eager to try the Slow Roasted Lamb sandwich.  The sandwich did not disappoint!  The bread was so fresh and the lamb with the three mustard sauce was a winning combination.

When you walk into this place you go up to the counter to place your order and they give you a number and bring you your food.  Very casual and ideal for lunch.  The sandwich selection is diverse and I would be willing to try them all.  There were also salads and pizza's that sounded equally as delicious.  

One of the best lunch spots west of Toronto.  Check it out if you can."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is awesome.  Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  And I likes me my sandwiches.

My wife and I were looking for a place to get some decent lunch and good coffee before heading back to the States.  We found this place on Yelp and decided to trek down to try it out.

My wife got the chicken sandwich with pears, brie, and caramelized onions. So freaking tasty!! It was a little messy, and stuff kept spilling out the sides, but each component was prepared well, and the combination of all the flavors was spot on.

I got the bbq pork sandwich (I ordered the rosemary crusted pork loin, but we were in a rush so I didn't bother having it changed).  I took one bite and instantly forgot what I previously ordered. The pork was tender and incredibly juicy.  I was worried the sauce might overwhelm the flavor of the pork, but it was perfectly balanced, and I had to keep myself from licking my fingers afterwards.

Our sandwich plates came with a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but we weren't sure what to do with it.  Dip the sandwich bread in it?  Weird.

We added the butternut squash/pear soup that tasted JUST LIKE AUTUMN. It wasn't too rich, had just a little sweetness from the pear, and had a perfect combo of spices that wasn'tcloying or overpowering.

Our coffee was good too, though not extraordinary.

The feel of the place is a little too yuppy for me, but I was told that's Oakville in general.  Some of the tables are a little too close together when not separated by aisles (ours was maybe two inches from the table to my left).  But I love the pictures on the wall and the black/red/yellow paint scheme.

Go get a sandwich there now!!"}
{"text":"Generous portions of the highest caliber ingredients. Don't be discouraged by the lineups. It's efficiently run, wait is short. Fantastic food."}
{"text":"Their pizza's are delicious. If you're a meat lover like I am go for the Giuseppe. It may have been the best pizza I've ever eaten (aside from my wife's of course). Atmosphere is great. Staff was friendly and truly genuine. I will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious  food. Space was a bit crammed. Parents I would recommend leaving strollers in the car if possible. 

Overall spectacular food, great staff, fast service. We will return. 

Tip: try the blackend salmon, its an open faced sandwich. It was sooo good. The pizza's are also deelish."}
{"text":"My girfriend have been here a few times.  I usually get a pizza, which is always pretty good except that the last visit it was very soggy as they loaded up the toppings in the middle.  My girlfriend usually get the pulled pork sandwich which is usually great except this visit it had way too much sauce on it.  But overall it is a great restaurant with good food!"}
{"text":"A cute little restaurant that serves amazing food. I've been here for brunch on weekends and dinner during the week. They have really good pastas and pizzas. I would recommend anyone to visit this place."}
{"text":"3.75 stars....
First time here today for thanksgiving brunch. My friends have raved about this place for ages and have been to several locations, thought I'd give it a try. 

I had the frittata - it was good. Salad on the side is a wise choice as this is a heavy meal and fries would have been too much. The slice of fresh baked bread, while tasty, was a bit too much bread for me. Overall it was a good and satisfying meal, good value. Atmosphere is good. Location is convenient and the service was great. 

The bottomless coffee is a big seller for me. While I wasn't super impressed overall (like, I still don't know what the \"big deal\" is about) I will try this place again and order something different."}
{"text":"I thought it was a cool restaurant and atmosphere. My pizza was really good but my boyfriends burger came out wrong and really tasteless. I didn't like how you had to pay before and tip before because I just opted to tip 15% not knowing how the food or service were going to be. Service was lacking but my boyfriend said the chocolate milk was the best he ever had!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try this place after reading the reviews and seeing the Yummy photos. 
Gotta say up front, however, that the prices were just too high. Over $100 for 4 mains - with 2 beers in there. I guess we were thinking this was a sandwich place. I mean, you order up front at the counter and are given a # to bring to your table. 

A quinoi salad for $5 was so tiny it's laughable, a glass of shiraz is $13 and the sandwiches (no sides) from $13 to $16! Are you kidding? Is this supposed to be fine dining? ....looks like they want you to think so.

Anyway we won't be returning anytime soon, but not simply because of the $$$. 
We tried the following menu items and here's the low down on each.

Giuseppe pizza - very greasy, as if it was pan-fried or something. Meat was too... big. Like whole slices of cold cuts which made it a pain in the #!& to eat because one bite pulled every last topping off the slice. Bleh. 
\"Famous\" lamb sandwich - my friend couldn't finish it. Not because of the mound of meat, but the taste was completely off... like they tried to hide the overcooked lamb, which was tough, with sweet sauce. Bleh. 
Steak sandwich - edible, but it tasted like a roast beef sandwich when the meet is simply warmed up by dipping it in sauce.....I would not try it again.
Nove sandwich - my 9 year old enjoyed her sandwich and the pesto/balsamic splash on the side.
I don't remember the name of my dish...it was
 fettuccine with chicken, mushrooms and goat cheese. I enjoyed the pasta,  though I didn't see or taste the goat cheese which was the main reason that I ordered it.

We won't be returning for another go. Not simply because the food was mediocre but mainly because it is very irritating to have a sandwich place try to pass off as fine dining with a walk up order counter. Just writing it irritates me."}
{"text":"Eating right now. We ordered the burger, tuna sandwich blackened chicken sandwich and the fettuccine with rose. Everything is excellent. Try the clam chowder as well. One bowl is not enough. Yum! Coming for brunch soon"}
{"text":"The BEST eatery in oakville hands down,
A little pricey, but worth every penny.
The slow roasted lamb sandwich is absolutely delicious. In fact every sandwich is!
They are very very generous when it comes to the fillings. I've been back quite a few times and can't wait to try out everything else.

Worth a repeat visit, over, and over, and over again."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Cooks are pleasant. Always smiling. Sandwiches are big and delicious. Brunches on Sunday are really good. Favourite place in Oakville 'fo sure."}
{"text":"Always consistent, good customer service and great food. We go there at least once a week. 
My favorite: Alsatian Chicken Sandwich and side Caesar Salad.

They used to have good desserts. I wish they would bring back the carrot cake and banana cake... or maybe not LOL"}
{"text":"Worth the drive every Friday night, best sandwiches and friendly staff!

Sunday brunch is also outstanding!"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed. Go with a big appetite and go early because this place gets busy at peak times. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We like the pizza here- to share between two people. Had the one with chicken and Carmelized onion/feta/mozzarella/olives/peppers. Good amount of toppings and I found a lot of flavor. The sandwiches are good but often loaded with cheese so a bit heavy. I think the curry chicken sandwich a nice change from the ordinary. I agree with others that the ordering system doesn't make sense- lining up to pay and hoping that there is a seat afterward is nuts to me, especially if the size of the restaurant is pretty small like Stoney's. 

Never been here for brunch because I here it gets packed quick."}
{"text":"Best breakfast or brunch. Everything is really good at this place. One of my favourite go-to restaurants. The staff is always kind and generous. 
Some of our favourites:
-Blueberry pancakes
-Crêpes de miel
- Santa Fe benedict
- Giuseppe pizza
- roasted chicken sandwich
- lemonade!

Cheers!

You'll leave with a full stomach and a giant smile on your face, always!"}
{"text":"I knew from the moment I walked in and EVERY seat was occupied (at 2pm!) that this place was going to be good.  Tons of different sandwich options on the menu, it was a really tough decision.  Lots of great drink choices in the cooler, as well as a full espresso bar and wine and beer.  

My pulled pork sandwich looked great and tasted even better.  High quality pork with a nice garlic aioli that really brought it all together.  I can't wait to try another one.

One last shout out to the service, very fast, and VERY friendly.  Great attitudes here.  Only caveat to this place is that it's all coin meter parking - don't forget your quarters!  Here's hoping Oakville gets on the 'Pay by Phone' train soon."}
{"text":"So good! Wow. Used to work in the area and found this place through some work connections. The food is spectacular--no wonder the lines often stretch out the door!  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Each and every item I've had has been delicious. 

Personally, I'd recommend the Southern Style Pulled Pork, but it's all outstanding.

I mention this place to anyone who even tangentially mentions being in the Oakville area. The only complaint I've ever heard is that there are too many customers (how horrible that must be)!

Note though, be there early for sunday brunch or be prepared to wait. It gets incredibly busy, even by Stoney's standards."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch and lunch spot.   Great soup,  salad, sandwich and pizzas.   This place is always packed,  and can be a bit of a zoo and tough to get a table, but well worth the wait for the well prepared food.  I've yet to be disappointed by any of their dishes."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and the wait was much too long. Atmosphere is casual but incredibly loud. Not a great place for a sit-down meal. You'd enjoy your time elsewhere for less."}
{"text":"Amazing well priced foods. Gets busy fast so make sure you get there before the rush."}
{"text":"Other than it being a little pricier than I like, the food is fantastic. Worth the random drop by's :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the slow cooked lamb sandwich and it tasted great! Very friendly staff and awesome ambience. My kids had pizza which they liked a lot."}
{"text":"Just had a very nice lunch, consisting of a 1/2 sandwich (Curried chicken with apricot and almonds) and a soup (butternut squash and pear).

The soup was nice, and the sandwich was delicious!!   

My hubby loved his roasted lamb sandwich.   

Only complaint was that he asked for pepper, and it never arrived.   Was nice to sit out on the patio.  The tables aren't very sturdy, but it didn't impact us too much.

Will likely return."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. We had pasta. Was ok. Nothing special. Didn't have enough taste for my liking. Bread was also fine. Again nothing special. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Super delicious, they also treat you nice and friendly, busy though specially around 1-2pm. Might have to wait for a vacant sit."}
{"text":"I still remember my first sandwich at Stoney's. It was a saturday night, my friend broke up with his girlfriend of 3 years. We sat under the dim lit lights as the server made his way to us. I got the flat iron steak and he had the grilled chicken. I lift the sandwich from the plate and bite it. At that exact moment, fleet foxes started playing in the background. A single tear rolled down my face and into my water. It was in Stoney's that i first experienced true happiness. 

I love you Stoneys."}
{"text":"Came to this place on account of all the hype. I was NOT dissapointed. The only downside here is that you have to pretty much serve yourself, and if you avoid the potholes (don't get seated before you pay for your food etc.) it's an overall pleasant environment. I personally had the slow roasted lamb sandwich as did my company. We also had giuseppe's pizza which was mouth-watering good. I will definitely be coming back here again, the prices are VERY reasonable."}
{"text":"We had slow roast lamb and nove sandwich,  the nove was ok, but lamb was out of this world.  Super juicy, tender and ficky."}
{"text":"This place has lots of really good reviews. Not to say they are not deserved. We were just underwhelmed.

We ordered the steak salad and the mushroom pizza. Both were good but nothing spectacular. We can get the same (if not better) quality food at neighborhood favourite, Artisano. 

The service was...pleasant but felt cold. Maybe because this location was so new (less than 1 month)? But staff seemed uncertain and really lacked the sincere friendly warmth you'd expect from places like this. 

Our bill came to almost $60 which is a bit expensive for two. So I don't know that we'll be back. For brunch, maybe."}
{"text":"Eating here for the 3rd time, the food was excellent as expected,  I ordered the blackened salmon sandwich, was very tasty but since it's an open sandwich,  a pain to eat"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots in the Islington/Queensway area.  I have been 4 times so far.  The service is very friendly and the food is excellent.  The salmon is possibly the best I have ever had.  Sandwiches are great and pizza is very good as well.  Nice to sit out on the patio on a hot summer day.  Customers order and pay at the counter and then you go sit down and they bring you your meal.  While the set up is more like fast food, the food quality is much more like a sit down restaurant.  Decor is modern and comfortable.  Prices for dishes range from $12-20.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food at this place is great but the cafeteria style of seating makes no sense and I probably won't be going back if I'm with my wife and child. We went in for breakfast with four adults and two infants right after the santa claus parade. We knew it was going to fill up so the women and the babies grabbed a table while myself and my friend got in line. The host lady came over and chastised us for sitting down before ordering!!! What does she think we're going to do with two babies??? #1 Stand in line with them? and #2 risk getting our food and having no where to sit? Yeah I don't think so. We ignored her but I felt like telling her we could leave if she wanted us to. The food is great but the way they seat people is uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Stoney's is my favourite Oakville restaurant. 
Breakfast, lunch or dinner, there is always something amazing on the menu. 

Love their Guiseppe's pizza and a goat cheese salad for dinner. Great to share. 
For breakfast/brunch, I always get the scrambled egg and bacon sandwich. Too good! Never disappoints. 

Understandably it can get really busy and you don't always get a seat right away. Go early or late on a nice day when the patio is open. Avoid Sunday brunch any time after 9:30 or before 1:30. Crazy time! Everyone loves it."}
{"text":"Disappointed not very good food. Service average and parking congested so I guess others like it"}
{"text":"Apart from line-ups to order (hint: call in order- even done it standing in line and got served faster) this is a favourite lunch/ dinner spot in Oakville.
Best for take-oit as it is always jammed and tables cramped and restaurant loud."}
{"text":"Its a love hate relationship with Stoney's. I love the ambiance, think the food is great and truly believe it is one of the best places to bring out of town visitors for bunch in Oakville. They have great coffee, excellent bread and the food is prepared fresh and from scratch and delicious smells fill the dining room. That being said I am not really fussed at all about the cafeteria style dining of sandwiches, soup, salad and pizza for near table service restaurant prices but hey it is tony Oakville after all. Nor am I fussed about the line up to order or the fact that sandwiches however good do not come with a side for the price but what can I really say its popular for a reason. The reason is the food is done really well. A beacon in the dark night of mediocre chain restaurants. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is legit.  Been wanting to stop here for a while after my Whole Food jaunts, but for some reason never got around to it.  Finally decided to try it today..

Let's move right onto the food.  Sunday Brunch menu was up.  There were 3 of us, so we just shared everything. 

1.  Florence St. Sandwich - $9.50:  \"Grilled chicken with tomatoes, artichokes, rocket, asiago and sundried tomato pesto aioli on ciabatta.\"  And GOTDAMN did it deliver.  Loved the oil & balsamic drizzle they had on the plate for dipping too.

2.  Coastal Mushroom Pizza - $13.50:  \"Portobello, shitake and crimini mushrooms with feta, mozarella and tomato sauce.\"  Another really tasty dish.  Crust is on the thin side, and it was nice and crispy.  The pizza itself was heavy though, from the generous amount of cheese and other toppings.  Not on the level of Pizzeria Libretto, but still a really excellent pizza.  Without sounding like a food network a$$h0l3, it was really \"earthy\". 

3.  Crepe au Miel - $9.00:  \"Field berries, with lemon and brown sugar flambe au Grand Marnier and vanilla whiped cream.\"  I'm not really a sweets guy, but my wife & sis-in-law were and they absolutely loved it.  Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and pineapples were scattered generously all over the dish.  There was a side of syrup as well.  Crepe was slightly on the thick side, but still very well made with nice texture.  I couldn't really taste any Grand Marnier though.  The best part of the dish was the fact that it was not overly sweet like most crepe dishes that I have tried.

Even though we arrived there at 2:30pm or so, the line up was still fairly long.  Things got moving fast though, and we were seated in less than 20 minutes.  You order up first, pay, get seated, and then the food arrives (like those mom & pop diners).  Service was very friendly from start to finish--really friendly staff.

I will definitely be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Do not get the pizza. Big mistake on my part. They loaded up my pizza with so much stuff it was soggy in the middle. I couldn't hold up the slice. Chunks of sausage were hard to eat in one bite as well as the giant strips of red peppers. The flavour was overall boring and overpowered by the black olives. For the price of a pizza I was not impressed. My bf got a blackened chicken sandwich which was delicious. But considering the price should have come with some sort of side. Instead it came with some weird olive oil pattern on the side, pretty but kind of useless. Worst of all was that no one came by to ask how anything was. Even though i got my pizza packed up after only eating two small slices (out of hunger). Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is probably my boyfriend and mines favourite go to place for something delicious and fast. I always get the maple glazed salmon salad, salmon is always cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce candied bacon and some veggies. My boyfriend ordered the surf and turf burger, and both of us were completely in awe. It was a beef patty with sautéed shrimp.. A bit hard to eat but the guacamole they has on it with the richness of the cheese, very complex flavours. The patty was slightly overcooked but the burger itself was probably one of the best flavoured burgers I've ever had. 

Great place for casual, delicious food."}
{"text":"Great meal! I ordered the butternut squash/pear soup and veggie sandwich. The soup was velvety, but not too heavy. The sandwich was delish and had sooo many veggies - eggplant, zucchini, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, roasted red peppers... The only thing I disliked about this meal is the sandwich was super messy and hard to eat because it was packed with so many things. Still tasty though :)"}
{"text":"Ended up here unexpectedly today around 1030 and was pleasantly surprised to find it not that busy and we could take our pick of seats. Pulled pork sandwich was great due to the garlic mayo. My wife said the curry chicken sandwich was good too, but cold. Somehow she was thinking it would be served warm. Soup of the day was chicken corn chowder which was delicious too. Stoney's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Good.  Not great.    It's ok, decent food, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I tried their slow roasted lamb sandwich....service was a bit slow given the fact that the place was almost empty. The quality of the ingredients were excellent...also the choice of garnishes was innovative and well executed. The count was adequate but not generous.
The biggest problem was value for money....at $8.95 it would be a reasonable value compared to Rocco's Plum Tomato or California Sandwiches which are both offering a better count at that pricepoint a short distance away. At the whopping price of $12 it was over priced. They need to drop the price or include an excellent side if they are going to be able to compete for my sandwich dollar. While the place is clean its still an order at the counter place not fine dining. The owners would do well to actually check out the competition and offer an equivilent value or face the consequences"}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant yesterday and it was great. Place was so busy we left in the past, but now I see why. Pasta was great, bread was great, price was reasonable and service was fast. Highly recommend you eat here."}
{"text":"Best smoked salmon sandwich I've ever had! The ingredients are fresh and absolutely delicious. Definitely on the pricier side but totally worth it because the portion was huge - had to split it into two meals"}
{"text":"First time at Stoney's, heard a lot of great things in the Oakville locations. Decided to try it out for weekend brunch. Got here around 1 pm. Got a seat fairly quickly as it was pretty busy. Ordered food which is reasonably priced. Only thing was we waited about 50 mins to get our food :(. Ordered the Santa Fe and a Giuseppe from the menu. Food was great!! Just the wait time was super long"}
{"text":"Stoney's never disappoints when it comes to quality food, I've had nearly everything on the menu and have not been able to pick a favorite, it's all just so good. The lamb sandwich definitely gets a thumbs up, and their brunch is second to none."}
{"text":"Food was freshly prepared and great! Convenient parking (credit cards accepted) across the street."}
{"text":"Always a happy and positive experience when coming to Stoney's. After falling in love with the Oakville location, I had high expectations for the new location and I must say they've exceeded these expectations. 

The atmosphere is always great. Very family-friendly. The service is fast regardless of how busy it can get (especially for Sunday brunch!) 

I've had their sandwiches, pizzas, soups, and salads and everything I've tried so far has been delicious and fresh. The food is pricey but the portions are quite large. 

Overall, I would recommend Stoney's to everyone and I will definitely continue to be a regular customer :)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is not so great. It gets very very busy on weekends and you should wait in a line up. Overall, I think this place is over rated."}
{"text":"Sometimes long waits, occasional paid parking, and yet ... its still great more often than not. Had one mediocre meal, and endless decliousness."}
{"text":"Stoney's in Oakville is probably my favourite restaurant in the world, and has been for the better half of a decade - so when I saw the sign going up on the Queensway I knew that Etobicoke (and Toronto) was in for a real treat. 

I dropped into the soft opening and wasn't disappointed.

The food is delicious, the service is efficient, the value is great, and the space is  bigger than the original and comfortably contemporary (whatever that means). The lamb is a great choice as a first timer, but going into salad world (try the salmon one), you can really have a time. I can only imagine how many pre-movie dinner dates will be held at this new Stoney's. Probably like 20 a night. 20!"}
{"text":"Love this place. And its not just for the Oakville MILFs that hang out for brunch.

I'll drive down here for the sandwiches any day of the week. 

as @Kat F says- sandwiches aren't the only things on the menu- Stoney's has a super popular brunch and pasta is crazy good / filling.

Ok, all those things are well and good...but the sandwiches are what really are right in my wheelhouse. Go for the slow roasted lamb. It's perfect. Garlic aioli and some spinach on a soft triangle focaccia bun."}
{"text":"As a fat guy, I'm a bit of a sandwich buff, and this place ranks high on my list of \"best ever\" sandwiches. Located in the less-scary-than-it-was-ten-years-ago Kerr Village area of Oakville, this is definitely one of the places I'll go despite the obvious trendiness and hype. 

The menu consists of probably a dozen decadent sandwiches, almost as many pizzas and a handful of salads. If you feel like dropping $3.50 on some overpriced juice, you can also do that here. Everything is certainly \"premium priced\" in terms of regular sandwich prices but there is great value in pretty much any option you choose. 

Your options are definitely gourmet, but not so pretentiously gourmet that you'll feel like a douche for ordering. Also, the menu has a number of basic/gourmet options that picky, non-foodophile's can appreciate. Let's just say my friend \"Chicken Parm\" Phil can even find a sandwich he loves here. 

While the sandwiches are clearly the focus (and rightfully so, try the lamb...mmm), the pizzas are fantastic and down right huge given the price ($8-14). My suggestion though is to stay away from the options with more than 4 different kinds of meat on them (there are a few) as they can get a bit salty. 

A small but upscale patio offers the chance to have that cute girl you were trying to pick up drive by and see you hungrily scarf down a sandwich, but you won't care, they're just that good."}
{"text":"I saw this place on a show on the Food Network and had to try it out. The sandwiches definitely hit the spot.  We had the lamb sandwich and the pork tenderloin sandwich. They each had their distinct flavour and were very tasty. The lamb was cooked very well.  The portions are large but I'd like a more affordable side than a $4 or $5 salad (fries?)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I've been now twice to Stoney's and each time I find myself contemplating if I should buy another one to go. 

I highly recommend Stoney's"}
{"text":"sandwiches like no other.

they are extremely on point with their sauce game - the meat and sauce ratios are the best I've tasted.
 
* the slow roasted lamb, blackened salmon, and the blackened chicken sandwiches will not disappoint"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Remembrance Day. 

Excellent service, waited in line behind one other couple to make our order at the back, then were told we could choose wherever we'd like to sit.

Fairly busy but not noisy, many tables still free. Nice general level of 'hubbub'. We were next to a family with a young child who were enjoying the atmosphere, and in the corner a couple of guys were having a business meeting over a laptop so many different people all mixed together.

We ordered the Stoney's Breakfast (foreground of photo) and the Frittata, along with a regular coffee and the Hot Toddy. Reasonably priced and great tasking.

Food came within 5 minutes of ordering. Recommended for brunch!"}
{"text":"Food? Excellent. Service? Not so much.

Took friends out to brunch at Stoney's a few weekends ago. We are die hard fans of Kerr St Cafe but they were packed and so we decided to try our luck at Stoney's.

Upon entering there was no one to greet us and so we assumed it was on us to find a table to sit at, then go up and place our orders. Within seconds we were scolded by an unfriendly server who told us 'you have to line up first THEN get a table, you can't just seat yourselves first' in a very unfriendly manner. We then watched as this same server gave her coworkers a roll of the eye and cast annoyed looks at us.

It is a shame because the food was actually very good and had we not felt so unwelcomed we likely would have been back but after this experience we will definitely steer clear.

Note to Stoney's - If you don't want customers seating themselves then either have a greeting station or put up some signage to indicate orders must be placed first. Moreover, don't be surprised or annoyed when customers take it upon themselves to find seats when there is no staff to greet or steer them in the right direction."}
{"text":"Situated on The Queensway, just West of the Cineplex Theatres you will find Stoney's second restaurant. There is limited parking space that is usually full on Sundays so you can also park on the streets by the theatres or in the parking at the bank across the street.

At Stoney's you are to order your food and drink, take a number and then wait to be seated if dining in the restaurant. Once your menu items are ready, the server will bring them to your table. From Sunday brunch, soups & salads, pizzas, to entrees, Stoney's offers a variety of fresh food items as well as alcoholic beverages. Not only is this charming atmosphere perfect for family brunch, it's great for dinner dates or a group get together.

Stoney's Omelette ($10.50) - pretty good but nothing spectacular.

Crêpe aux Fraises ($11.00) - I love crepes but this is like berry overload with syrup. It was way too sweet for me.

Spinach Frittata ($10.50) - Didn't expect too much of this frittata but it was quite delicious with sundried tomatos and asiago cheese in combination with the spinach!

Stoney's Breakfast ($12.00) - scrambled eggs, crispy bacon & hashbrowns, it's pretty typical but they give you a big portion.

Santa Fe Eggs ($11.00) - being an eggs benny fan, this was right up  my alley. With back bacon, charred peppers and pico de gallo, it was delicious! It comes with a side salad which was really tasty as well.

Canadian Peameal Back Bacon ($8.00) - This was alright but probably wouldn't order again.

The service at the new Stoney's restaurant is friendly and welcoming as well. Of course during peak hours it's expected that there would be a wait but during my most recent visit, the staff seemed to be settling in well.

What I really enjoy about Stoney's is the restaurant quality market fresh food that's available in a casual atmosphere where you set the pace for your dining experience. It offers the best of both worlds: dine-in or take-out in an efficient manner."}
{"text":"The location is convenient, coming from Mississauga, we just got on the QEW towards Hamilton and exited on Kerr and kept going straight! It's hard to miss since it's on the corner and the sign for it is pretty big.

Once inside, I was a little surprised since I thought it was a restaurant but it's more a hybrid of fast food and a sit down. 

After you sit down, the servers will bring the food to your table. I ordered the house smoked salmon sandwich with a side Caesar salad. The sandwich was amazing, the proportions are generous and with the salad, it was definitely enough and you can probably pack some home! The bread was fresh and soft and so was the salmon! It also had incredible flavour.

My friend ordered the daily sandwich special which had grilled chicken, bacon, avocado sauce etc. Just looking at her sandwich made me want to eat more!

Our other friend, Suparna ordered the butternut squash and pear soup and even though it looks small, she said it was filling! Another bonus is that all their drinks are in the classic bottles which really gives it a diner feel!

The price was average and if you're ordering a sandwich, salad and drink you can expect to pay around $20! Definitely worth the money though!

If you're looking for a new place to try out this weekend, head over to Stoney's. It certainly helps that Oakville is such a cute city and you can spend the rest of the afternoon walking along the streets and shopping in the little boutiques along the street!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Stoney's. I live in Mississauga and I regularly make the 20 min. drive down here just to have their sandwiches. 

I've tried their atlantic smoked salmon, new york steak, roasted lamb, pulled pork, and balsamic chicken. I highly recommend all of them. The portions are big, and the flavour is even bigger. The sandwiches come with an olive oil/balsamic extract mixture on the plate that tastes amazing.

I also often get a side of salad with my sandwich which is also great. The tomatoes are nice and crunchy and the goat cheese is always delicious.

I've also tried their pizza (margarita) which was quite lackluster. if you come to Stoney's, I suggest you stick to their sandwiches or salads. 

The prices at Stoney's aren't the cheapest ($10-$15), but for what you're getting, it's definitely worth it. I've had $40+ meals that don't hold a candle to a stoney's sandwich.

Stoney's is always packed with long line-ups during peak hours. They do move people in and out fairly efficiently though. If you decide to come, I recommend sticking to parties of 4 or less."}
{"text":"Great brunch and lunch spot. Had one of their chicken sandwiches and it was large, flavourful, juicy and with excellent sauces and garnishes. Not too salty. A bit oily though. 

Also, had the butternut squash and pear soup - delicious and creamy, came out nice and hot. 

My friend got the big breakfast and it definitely was big! Potatoes on the side were a bit plain but came with cherry tomatoes and cheese which was nice. 

All reasonably priced at entrees around $10-$12. Wouldn't mind trying the slow cooked lamb sandwich next time. 

Lots of open seating, and I like the self-serve ordering - makes the process much faster. Food came out quick. 

They also have a separate coffee bar which is a great addition for those wanting espresso-based beverages. Didn't try anything here though.  

Parking area is extremely tight."}
{"text":"I was so excited that Stoney's opened up in Etobicoke. I've already been twice. The Etobicoke location is bigger than the Oakville one and everything is brand spanking new!  Really nice interior. The service was good. The staff were very helpful and friendly.  It's not that busy yet but when the news gets out that a great new casual restaurant is opening up in Etobicoke, I'm sure it will be very busy. 

Love the Nove sandwich. You gotta have it. So good and make sure you get extra balsamic sauce on the side. The sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"The most amazing sandwiches around! My friends and I are always down to come here, never a disappointment, they do not skimp on the good stuff (meat) that makes the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great place to hangout on a Thursday morning .... coz it's flooded with people on the weekend 

Went there with friends... tried their coffee (comes without sugar) ,teas, chicken bread with caramel i we onions n apples (it was  at first bite!) and chocolate cake.. which was soso. 

Good ambiance..: fast service... economical prices. Have good indoor n outdoor space."}
{"text":"I do enjoy this restaurant. I stick to takeout, and usually call in my order. They are busy as there is nothing around like it.   But if you can snag a table, their platings are a thing of beauty. I have eaten in at their new, Queensway location a couple times because it had not gotten busy there yet. 

The soups are lovely, well priced, great portion, beautiful consistency. Tasty toasty bread slices served complimentarily for bread lovers. The salads are huge and delicious.  

I went through a period of bad health for most of a year. I lived off their squash soup (unable to prepare my own food or digest most things), and the staff knowing this, made the experience really positive.  Thanks."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch. Very interesting and tasty sandwiches.
The line ups can be long but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Anyone in the West end should know about Stoney's!  They have fabulous lunches.  Their sandwiches are out of this world, fresh bread every day.  I most recently went there for breakfast on a Saturday and they did not disappoint.  I got a spinach fritatta and it was fabulous.  Big chucks of mushroom and cheese with spinach.  The side salad was perfectly dressed.

They have great coffee as well.  I would recommend going there for their Sunday brunch which I have heard great things about."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the Stoneys Breakfast. The place is really clean and the service is really great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had a couple client meetings in Oakville today so I stopped in for lunch. I had the roasted lamb sandwich. They have quite a few different sandwich, salad, and pizza options, but I couldn't tell you how any of those options are because I always get the lamb. It's just too good not to get.

This sandwich is the perfect harmony of ingredients. The tanginess of the mustard aioli, the tender richness of the lamb, the fresh baked bread, those delicious drizzles of balsamic reduction and herbed oil on the plate. Oh my golly. This sandwich is the best lamb sandwich you'll ever find anywhere. If you think you don't like lamb, try this sandwich. It will change your opinion.

Quite a few reviews complain about not being able to sit  without having ordered first, even when there are tables available. Listen, this place gets crazy busy at lunch (and at brunch on weekends, I would imagine). They need to exercise control over the seating process. It's better that someone without food wait for a while for a table rather than someone whose food is ready doesn't have a table to sit down because they've all been taken by people who are \"saving\" tables. If they get lax about the process when times are slow, then they'll have less control when they're busy. I don't blame them at all for establishing seating rules. Don't like it, don't go.

I would recommend that you try to get there before 12PM if you want to avoid the lunch rush."}
{"text":"We stayed at a hotel in Oakville and decided to go downtown for lunch. We found Stoney's! We had our dog with us and we were happy to see that they had an outside patio, our dog could sit on the other side of the gate. My husband got a pizza and I got a Caesar salad with chicken. Both were really good and you can tell they use fresh ingredients. They have large portions. FYI - It's cafeteria style, so you order your food first, then they will seat you and bring your food to you. That was a bit confusing, but a friendly server explained it to me. We have already recommended Stoney's to a couple of people."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful food (and if it wasn't made right, they'll make it again). Ambiance is nice, great for a date or hang out with a few friends. It can get crowded at certain times (main eating times). Entrance, exit and parking is difficult though. Also, close to the theatres so a great date night but again, can also get crowded."}
{"text":"I actually found this off Yelp and being a local was surprised to have never noticed it before. The location is easily leading the way in making Kerr St. more like the downtown with its interior décor and wonderful small café patio. 

Even better the staff inside where all smiles and very pleasant. The lunch hour crowd was large so get there early or be prepared for a line up. There is no better review then the size of this line!

I was on the hunt for a great sandwich and found one. I had the \"Calabria's\" chicken sandwich which was just exceptional. I used to have a favorite at Sharky's called the \"Pebble Beach\" this is my new favorite. After reading the menu there will for sure be one or more new favorite sandwiches on the way. They also look to have a really good breakfast menu that I am really looking forward to trying.

With company coming for the summer this is going to be a stop for lunch and maybe a Sunday breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"Okay so they say you have not stepped foot in Oakville if you have not been to Stoneys. 
About a week or two ago I decided to go to this place since I had heard that it was freakishly good. 
I got tired of people talking about it so I said to myself I'm going. 
when I stepped foot on the place surprisingly it was empty which apparently it's not the usual because the place is always packed. 
the people working were nice, hip and helpful with their menu. 
I had a sandwich and my wife had pizza, they were both cooked with details and in perfect flavor harmony. 
We also has coffee which was standard as my wife and I are coffee drinkers so we tend to be a bit picky. 
Overall this place is a just try! 

Happy Stoneys, cheers!"}
{"text":"Been to Stoney's numerous times. Food is fantastic although I am not 100% sold on the pre-order line up and wait for a seat... but it seems to work for most ppl..."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for brunch.  Long line up to order the food. Seating area is limited. Very busy but worth the wait. Sandwiches are delicious.  If you like lamb, go for the lamb sandwich.  Seafood chowder is not the traditional kind.  It's tomato base and tiny bit spicy."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation by our friends, but didn't find anything too different or unique about it. We found it expensive for what was offered, but the food was still good. However we are not running back to try something else. 

I ordered the breakfast special, and my husband ordered a burger. Both of us liked our food but were not wowed. 

Upon entrance service seemed a bit slow to catch our order, and we also waited about 25+ minutes for our order, which I find long, for the kind of service they offer. 

Not much different from Panera or Artisano if you ask me."}
{"text":"This place have a big menu on sandwiches, pizzas, salads and pastas for dinner. I tried two pizzas and a sandwich. All of them were delicious! I love Italian style pizzas! The sandwich I had was called Florence. The grilled chicken was perfectly seasoned. Yum! They also have good coffee. I like the relaxing vibe there. Will def go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"We were on our way back home to Toronto and came for Saturday brunch after seeing this resto on the list of \"You Gotta Eat Here\" spots in Burlington.

What I wish I knew: it's self-serve quick service restaurant. Go to the back of the house; grab your own drinks/make your own coffee; wait for a minute to be told where you'll sit. They will bring your food to you but you will need to grab your own condiments and refills.

The servings are large. Unless you're famished you will likely not finish your meal! My husband enjoyed his stoney sandwich. I was...meh! I liked the garlic aioli. I only ate half of my sandwich and took the reminder to go. It would've been nice to have a side salad with my sandwich. It as a massive egg sandwich. The balsamic and olive oil decorative design on my plate so I can spread over it my bread was nice too.  The coffee tasted good. Again I had to take it in their to go container. I feel like the flow of the restaurant service would've been better. I read a yelper describe it like Marche....I guess....but not really!"}
{"text":"I feel as though this restaurant has very high aspirations, but has fallen prey to a common misconception. It isn't enough for food to look good. It must taste as good as it looks. 

I have dined here twice. Once for brunch and once for dinner. A trend has emerged. The food is magnificently plated and delivered to tables in a cozy open layout dining room. Unfortunately the food fails to impress on every level. The pizza I had this evening had limp, cheap pepperoni crowning middle of the road cheese sitting atop slightly sour tomato sauce spread upon a crust that was a touch underdone. The result was a beautiful pie that was an abject failure.

I really wish more places would clue in to the fact that food should first be delicious. Only once that is achieved should you work so much on presentation.  It's the flavor we will remember and come back for."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon limited menu with walk up ordering in the back. Awesome sandwiches. Packed. Nice place for a casual brunch in downtown Oakville."}
{"text":"Still amazing.  Order the daily pizza today and it came with mango chutney.  What they meant was GIANT pieces of mango spiced deliciously.  When baked it took on a sweet-potato-like consistency.  So good!  They overloaded the pizza with toppings (i.e. didn't skimp on the bacon) and the crust is nice and thin, PLUS not burnt (like some places do).  Portions are so big I only ate a quarter of the pizza.  Looking forward to having the rest later..

Also got a soy latte to go.  Also amazing.  I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"Stoney's has excellent service, good hours and delicious food. Their pulled pork sandwiches will quickly become an addiction. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here because good reviews, end up very disappointed. Very slow servie even just have 3 tables for entire restaurant, no one here care about the customers paid for their foods but have to wait forever! Lamb Sandwich was so dry and no flavored. Mushroom Pizza was burned on the crust and lack of sauce and cheese, soup we had also tasted old and over spiced.  Poor service and poor food.Won't come again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  It's an interesting model, a high end variant of cafeteria style order-at-the-counter, with quite good food.  We eat here every couple of months and quite enjoy it.  Last visit I had the daily burger, which was a ground chicken patty, nicely grilled, with grilled red  pepper, onions, bacon.   Nice oil and pesto do to go along with it.  Challenging to eat as a burger since it's quite large, but a couple of napkins and 'open wide'.  Service isn't an issue as there isn't any.  Order at the counter, you get a number to take to your table, and in a few minutes you get food."}
{"text":"I have been to the Oakville location 2 times, and while I thought the food was delish, I didn't see what the craze was about. Basically, I thought it was a great brunch/lunch place for local Oakvillers, but I wouldn't make the drive out (as my friends wanted too).

And now, there is a Stoney's closer to home and I thought the food was really great! Especially the Catalunya pizza which is big and comes with chunky artichokes and veg. The pizza's here are good to share. I also like the concept of placing your order and then grabbing a table; they will come and bring the food. While waiting, you can get some nice drinks: a glass or bottle of wine and cool beers.

This location also has a pretty nice patio.

If ever I was in the West end and wanted something good to eat, but casual, I would totally recommend Stoney's."}
{"text":"Love the casual feel of this place. Great price for fantastic food! I absolutely loved my eggs Benedict on their special toast with pulled pork and fresh salsa. Will def come back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"amazing food, but often is slow to be served. the set up of the restaurant works well but it is small so it can fill up quick. has an outdoor patio but there isn't much to it. portions are large"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I love everything about this place. We ordered: Salmon Quinoa Salad and open-faced Blackened Salmon with Focaccia.

The portions were massive and I love love loved the Salmon! They're super friendly and quick service. We went in the afternoon and it wasn't packed. The first time we went, it was quite busy at 11 AM - just plan on it. It's great! Highly recommend!

Been to their Etobicoke location too and it's just as great!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast/lunch place in Oakville. Both the Oakville branch and the Etobicoke branch are amazing. Food is always delicious and portions are huge. My favourite menu is the balsamic chicken sandwich and is a must-try! Their Sunday brunch menus are also delicious. You really can't go wrong with Stoney's and I would recommend to anyone visiting/living in the Oakville/Etobicoke area."}
{"text":"Stoney's is well known restaurant that needs no introduction. 
Consistently delicious for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner. 

I had their butternut squash soup with a brewski after class and it was very creamy and flavourful. It was a little rich for my liking but still very yummy.  

The soup came with a slice of toasted ciabatta bread. 
Perfect pairing to dunk into the soup!

I would definitely recommend all SOUP lovers to head over to Stoney's!"}
{"text":"They definitely serve up a mean omelette! Came by for breakfast with my sisters and ordered three different omelettes (Stoney's chorizo, mushroom and spinach) and really liked each of them. They definitely do not cheap out on their cheese or ingredients! They also serve your omelette on a bed of spring mix salad with their house balsamic vinegar and their own baked bread which I absolutely love!

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went on a Monday at 5:30 and it was nearly empty, had my to-go order in my hand in 5 minutes.  They did have a 'wait to be seated' sign up as other reviewers suggested.  The service was perfectly nice.

So is it worth the hype?  In short: YES.
I got the flat iron steak sandwich, and even though it was huge, I just couldn't stop eating it until it was gone. I'm glad I got takeout too because it's not fit for public consumption. I was a complete mess afterward.  The butternut squash soup was good but a bit heavy on the clove.

In summery it's a great place to get well crafted food, and though the prices are rather high I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"So happy that this business has come to the Queensway, I couldn't bare the fact that the best brunch in the world (fact) was all the way in Oakville. Now it's only 10 minutes away and they do brunch and so much more!

I've been in on 3 different occasions now to this location and I've been pretty happy with most of the food I've had to date. On my first visit I had the Stoney's Burger which was juicy and beautifully cooked, served with some fingerling potatoes and topped with a sweet onion topping and a pickle it's a deadly gourmet burger for sure (I ate every single bite... and finger swiped my plate at the end).

On my next visit I had the sandwich that made them famous - the roasted lamb sandwich. It was a healthy service size, and the meat was overflowing our from within it's massive bun confines. The aioli on this is simply to die for, I would eat this on bread by itself if it was served as such. Paired with a garden salad (another huge portion) I was stuffed and super satisfied when I left. 

Last night I was there with a friend and decided to go for one of their signature pizza's. I went with the Gieussepe, which is topped with pepperoni, bacon and some other Italian cured meats. The thin crust was cooked perfectly, however the toppings on top were over cooked and slightly burnt. Additionally I found the sauce too sweet. That said, when I raised my concerns with the manager, he was quick to address all and mentioned that the sauce is the Stoney's signature sauce and that other guests had mentioned the sweetness and that they would be implementing an additional sauce option (a more mild marinara) in the future. 

What I love about this place is how, even though it is a copy of the Oakville location, they're willing to make small adjustments to make their new customers happy - and it's working! People are lining up (literally) to eat here night after night! So come early and come hungry!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place, I finally made it here enroute to a cross border shopping trip one weekday morning for brunch.   I got the most talked about dish they had - The Blacken Atlantic Salmon Sandwich and it didn't disappoint.  The salmon was perfectly done, moist and tender to the touch.  The side of mango salsa worked well in combination of everything else on the dish.  The plating was well done, it looked so pretty it could have easily been on one of those food competition shows. 

We also ordered the Giuseppe`s pizza, that was sublime! The first bite reminded me of the flavours of the Deep Dish Pizza I`ve had in Chicago, only this was served in a New York style thing crust.  The roasted tomatoe sauce was the star of the pizza, it was tasty with a hint of zing that forced me to take a moment to savor the state of euphoria I was having.  This was the best pizza I`ve had in the GTA area, and yes it`s better than Pizzeria Libretto.  This place is a must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Located in the Kerr Street Village of Oakville there is something magical about the food at Stoney's. Whether you're here from breakfast, brunch or lunch on weekends, the food is always tops and the portions are unbelievably huge! 

Our not so tiny gaggle of yelpers wanted to start off their Sunday in Oakville right and there is no better way to do that then dining at Stoney's. Before raving about their food, I do feel they might need to reexamine their order procedure which requires you to wait in a line and order similar to a McDonalds only to have your food prepared and brought to you upon seating. I can see how this eliminates wait times once seated but as Jennifer N noted, if you want something else (more coffee, a dessert, something else to drink, etc) it makes it difficult to do so.

Now that the one minor inconvenience is out of the way, lets get into what I ordered that day. To start I REALLY wanted to try their café mocha, as I saw their barrista preparing one while I waited to order. Ordering my entree proved to be slight more difficult as everything that had been review on yelp sounded incredible, in the end I decided on the Stoney's Omelet, and I'm pretty sure that my lunch was the envy of others around me because it was easily 4-5 inches thick when folded over. Filled with cheese, huge chunks of sausage and veggies...yumm!!!

Fair warning folks, this place get PACKED on weekends and you'll need to get their early (pre-10am) to get a seat right away. On the flip side the patio in the summer has plenty of seats and let's face it, with food this good you could eat it out of a to-go container in your car if you had to and it would still be pure bliss. 

Eatcrest Out!

** This brunch was eaten during one of our Discover GTA days, if you've got a fun hamlet, town, city or village you'd like for yelpers to travel to for an afternoon of food and fun give me a shout and we can organize it together! **"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice now and both times I have been served well. I have tried the lamb sandwich and the open faced new York steak burger now. Both were just delicious. The meat was soft and the cheese and bread in the right proportion. The caramelised onions and mushrooms on the steak burger added the required sweetness to the burger. Having said that, there are more sandwiches/burger on the menu that need my attention. Needless to say, I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Made famous in Oakville, it's popularity lead to its expansion in Etobicoke where I paid a visit. The first thing I see is a sign that literally says \"Yes, we're the same place as in Oakville\". Confident I am at the right place, I was eager to see what this \"higher end Panera's bread\" had in store for me. Like the aforementioned restaurant, you order at the counter first, grab a seat and they bring you your order.  We started with a delicious coconut curry soup; it was warm, thick and not overpowering to the palate. Next we had a fresh grilled chicken salad - hearty veggies with moist grilled chicken. Tip: ask them to put less dressing or put it on the side.  The lamb sandwich was also a big hit. Succulent pieces of lamb sandwiched between 2 fresh buns made me devour it.  We ended the meal with a carrot cake, which was probably one of the best I've ever had: Not too sweet, smooth frosting, moist cake. I don't know if I was just lucky, but this was a great, albeit expensive, foodie experience. Panera bread and the like should watch out."}
{"text":"I tried both the Balsamic Chicken and the Roasted Lamb Sandwich and both were amazing and very filling."}
{"text":"This is just what the burgeoning neighbourhood surrounding the Cineplex at Islington and Queensway needed. Combining the delicious and hearty Toronto-Italian style of dishes with the more upscale modern-looking restaurants, Stoney's Bread Company has the best of both worlds. Reasonable prices on classic comfort food like pizza, sandwiches, salads and soups along with a gorgeously decorated spacious dining room overlooking the Queensway with careful attention to details like clearly laid out and organized parking outside and beautifully decorated single occupancy bathrooms makes this restaurant a winner. The sandwich I had and the soup was very satisfying making me want to try other selections plus the pizza I saw there looked fantastic! Liquor license is coming. The brunch menu looks stellar as well."}
{"text":"New York Steak sandwich!!! Open sandwich, mushrooms, cheese, and a nice healthy dose of dark green salad on the side. The butternut squash soup was also very tasty, though a bit too thick for my taste.

 Excellent meal, if it weren't so far away in Oakville, would frequent again!"}
{"text":"I'd heard so many great things about this place, so had to check it out.  It's the type of place where you order first, then you're seated, and your food comes to you. The minute we walked through the door, and I scoped out everyone's dishes, I was stoked!  The pizza, the salads, the sandwiches - it all looked amazing!   I had the calabria sandwich -- I wish I could say that I loved it, but I didn't.  It was so smothered in aioli (and I like aioli -- but this amount was intense!) that it actually made the delicious bread all soggy.  I ended up ditching the bread and just eating the chicken (which was good). A bit of a bummer sandwich experience.  Just a word of advice -- if ordering this sandwich, you may want to encourage them too go easy on the aioli.  My mom had the curry chicken salad and she loved it.  I tried it and thought it was awesome too.  Finished our lunch with an americano, and it was great.  I'd definitely go here again, I'd just change my selection strategy!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and the food was fantastic! The location in itself is beautiful and they have both inside and outside seating. I ordered the key west eggs Benedict and the guacamole and pico de gallo on top tasted very fresh. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the focaccia was perfectly crunchy without being too hard. Would definitely come again and try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"1/ I feel a bit overwhelming with the portion of the food. In fact, it should be a reverse where quality exceeds quantity. In my opinion, the quality of the food is just average, no kick to it (nothing special to leave me a \"wow, I have to come back to this place\" although I did come back a few more time to try different dishes in order to judge fairly)
2/ the price is a bit on a high side compared to their quality of food. 
3/ the inside seating area is like a war zone on a busy sunny weekend where the line up could interfere with your nice brunch/lunch.
4/ it is not a baby or young kid friendly place because there is no place for you to park the stroller or baby seat carrier."}
{"text":"Service and food are great. The soup I had was not great for the price but I have had their other food and coffee and it is awesome. Unfortunately went back to the Etobicoke location to try their brunch but it is CLOSED INDEFINITELY. So sad :( Oakville is still open though."}
{"text":"Great cafe with delicious gourmet sandwiches and salads. Can't go wrong with any really. Must get there by 11:45 for lunch or will have to wait in line to order and for a table."}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed this place?! Probably out of selfishness since this place is busy enough without more people making the wait longer - sorry but I want my food fast!

Stoneys never fails to disappoint. From a soup to a sandwich to their delicious pizzas and pastas - everything (and I do mean everything) is fresh, tasty, and filling.

I recommend practically everything on their menu - go multiple times so you can try everything. Brunch is delicious and unpretentious - the Santa Fe eggs are my fave (but then you try the French toast and you wonder why you didn't order that as well...)

Tips: order first, then sit. The service is fast so don't be daunted by the line. That being said please don't be a jerk and loiter at your table well after you're done eating. Get up and get out so someone else can enjoy without starving to death!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting find. Thanks to Super CM I had this place booked marked for a while. We came here for a late weekend brunch. My dinning companion ordered the egg florentine I went with a French Toast. 
We ordered a coffee and cappuccino on the side. Cappuccino was pretty bad. 
On to main the Eggs florentine fared a lot better. Well poached egg, nicely sauced and seasoned well. 
French toast is a huge portion and is visually appealing. The taste just didn't do it for me. The bread that they used is quite dense and will settle so you are warned there. 
A nice clean space and plenty of items on offer. They also had a promo where one can get a discounted movie tix. Good option if you are in the area and want to have a quick clean meal.
3.5 stars."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat in Oakville and we noticed Stoney's bread company. It was delicious!!! 

1- the bread was soft and fresh. I love the fact that they put vinegar/oil on your plate to dip it with your sandwich. Great touch. 

2- the chicken breast they use is fresh and tender! Make sure you try the blackened chicken! 

3- my friend is lactose intolerant and they were very nice enough to substitute the cheese with olive paste and sundried tomatoes with no extra charge! 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches I've ever tasted. Definitely try the lamb sandwich. It's bursting with flavours. 

The jambalaya pasta was also delightful. It's a bit pricey but the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Always, always has great food.  Nothing too complicated,  pasta, sandwiches, pizza.  What more do you need.  I love when a place does something really well.  Stoney's does food really well.  

Not sure I love the ordering/seating system though."}
{"text":"Limited service restaurant, maybe the best working limited service I've been to. They have it all figured out. Wait in line, order, go to your table, the server has it from that point on. 
Servers are very friendly, as they are generally in Oakville. 
Food is very good for a bakery/bistro. 
Interior is generic, not very airy but an open vibe. 
We'll be back when ib Oakville."}
{"text":"Pretty average, I don't really see what the hype is about. Nothing special in terms of food tastiness, food presentation, or service. Maybe a notch higher than what you'd get at Williams."}
{"text":"Best lamb sandwiches ever! Need a few more vegetarian options but definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday after lunch so it wasn't that busy.  It's a cool casual concept where you pay for your food first and then they bring it to your table.  Their whole menu looks really good and they also have a daily special menu of soups, sandwiches, pizza and pasta's...some of which are not on the regular menu.  

I ordered the daily pizza special which was not on the regular menu - Chorizo, chicken, shrimp, red onions, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, asiago, mozzarella and pesto.  High quality toppings on a thin crust pizza.  I also split a slow roasted lamb with sweet onion marmalade.  It was really good for the first couple bites but started getting a bit too sweet with the marmalade...over-powered the lamb.  They have really cool soda options such as grapefruit soda.  They also provide self-serve ice water with lemon if you don't feel like purchasing a drink.  
I would definitely come back and try their brunch or other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I had the roasted lamb sandwich here. Honestly it was amazing, I kept thinking about it all day. It's really big too so definitely worth what you pay for. They keep it fairly simple with just tomatoes and rockets. The sauces with the sandwich put the finishing touches on the sandwich. My coworker got soup, it also looked very good but come on now... Roast lamb sandwich."}
{"text":"Stoney's is a classic oakville spot. Great for a quick sit down dinner or take out during the week. As well as the brunch on the weekend has a great selection of options appealing to all crowds. I recommend their salads and sandwiches, not to mention their amazing butternut squash soup! The owner is very friendly and welcoming. It's consistently  good experience and a gem on the Kerr street strip."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this place out as it's close by and the menu looks enticing!  So decided today to pickup a sandwich to go after reviewing their website.

First impression was that it's nice inside - I like the decor!

Unfortunately, even though it was not a busy time - about 1:30 pm on a Tuesday, with about half the restaurant empty and no line up, I was kept waiting to order.  In addition no one greeted me while I was waiting even though there were a number of employees behind the counter walking past me.  When someone showed up to take my order, there was no smile or other measure of good customer service.  It was a transaction by a seemingly disinterested employee.

I ordered a chicken sandwich to take out.  Cost was $13; ok for a gourmet sandwich.  I found the wait long to get the sandwich, again, taking into the account the restaurant was pretty quiet and there had been no line before me ordering food.  It took 18 minutes to get my takeout sandwich.  For me, that is too long to wait when I am grabbing takeout.  I did try to pre-order online from Stoney's website, but the link to \"Order Pickup\" would not work even with multiple attempts.

Nothing to do with food, but the driveway really needs attention.  Left a bad impression as I was driving away dodging HUGE potholes.

I get back to the office, excited to try my sandwich as the description sounded yummy.  My initial thought when I opened the box was that it was a good size; I tried to pick it up but it was too soft and heavy so it really should be cut in half at the restaurant.  The bread, although toasted, got soggy on the bottom from being closed in the takeout box.  The most disappointing though, and unforgivable, is that the top crust of the bread was burnt.  As in burned black - photo attached.  Yuck.

I will not be back.  There is better out there."}
{"text":"I found Stoney's to be somewhat over rated, but not bad.  I had a pizza with a limp and soggy crust that otherwise was generously portioned and tasty.  The sandwiches were decent, but nothing to rave about.  You would think, judging from the 30 minute wait in line at Stoney's, there's nowhere else to grab lunch in Oakville.  Not so.

Most infuriating, after waiting a half hour in line, my party of four was paying at the register so I grabbed a four-top booth whereupon the manager jumped my shit, insisting they don't allow \"saving tables\".  I get up and two ladies who were actually just standing around grab the four-top.  No problem, then two two-top booths open up right next to each other, and the manager won't let us sit there, either, because we are a party of four.  Instead of being seated at a booth, they direct me to a table mid-traffic. Nobody EVER sits at the two two-tops I wanted.  Ten minutes later while we are still waiting for our lunch, the hostess tells us we can move to another four-top booth. F-that.

What bonehead, anal retentives these people are!!  If your customer wants a booth, give 'em a fricken booth!!!!!  Maybe they will overlook the middling food and come back because you're nice and accommodating, duh!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't complain!  It's good food!  Good portions and quality!  Good variety!  Nice surroundings.  Good crowd.  Great Saturday afternoon quick lunch!  

You order at the counter and they bring to the table.  Not fast food!!!  Way better!  Restaurant quality without the wait!

Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I visited the original Stoney's location in Oakville a few years ago and was very impressed by the food and atmosphere. I was super excited when I heard they opened a second location closer to home. I went during lunch on a weekday and it was insanely busy - they had to stop taking orders until the tables became available again. Regardless of how hectic things were, most of the staff were extremely friendly and operated very well under pressure. 

I ordered a shrimp and scallop caesar salad and a latte. My boyfriend had some sort of chicken sandwich. Both portions were huge and the price was very fair compared to other places we've frequented. The dressing on my salad was a little too heavy, I wished I asked for half the dressing. The place is confusing to navigate during busy hours. We weren't sure if we were suppose to be seated first or order first. When the counter staff told us she couldn't take our order yet because they're backed up, she didn't direct us anywhere. People were scattered and lost their place in line. I've been here on a quiet day before and everything was great so it's understandable when things get a little chaotic during peak hours. Food was great still!"}
{"text":"Had the Rosemary Crusted Pork Loin sandwich and it was an explosion of flavor. The mix of the sweet onion and tomato confit and the asiago provided the perfect foil to the pork. Add in the three mustard aioli and it was quite a sandwich. Plus the size is enormous!"}
{"text":"Mmm Mmm GOOD! So this past week, I went for the second time. Always a great environment, as I entered into the restaurant. Great service, chefs always laughing and having a good time. Servers, very caring. Thing is you have to order first, then find your seating. Kinda brings it back to the cafeteria days. Order in line, pay, get your number, find a seat, and then your food gets brought over.

First time I went was on a Saturday afternoon, and I ordered the \"Bilbao\" pizza ($13.50, chorizo sausage, wild mushrooms, roasted garlic, bacon and cambozola with tomato sauce). I even added pepperoni, because I'm a \"meatatarian\" haha.

Second time I went, they had a daily soup special, \"Roasted Garlic Potato and Bacon\" soup. ($5.00) Can't go wrong with garlic!! That was my starter and for my meal, I ordered the \"NY Steak Sandwich\" ($13.50, caramelized onions, wild mushrooms and brie served open face on focaccia with mixed field greens). My friend had the \"Spinach Salad\" ($12.00, poached chai tea pears, cambozola, asaigo, spiced pecans, apricots and champagne vinaigrette). 

I've posted pics of the pizza, NY steak sandwich and the spinach salad.

Some things I'd give negative points:
- it's a bit expensive
- they have a different menu (daily breakfast, sunday brunch, pasta, etc)
- no website to help promote 
- seat yourself
- the distance if you're not from Oakville (haha kidding)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is OH MY, HOLY FAR! But this place is OH SO WORTH THE DRIVE! 

Everything Stoney's that I put in my mouth (with the exception of dessert) was more than delicious. And here are the items I ate during my first and only visit (but soon to be alot more than the one time): 

- butternut squash and pear soup 
- spinach salad with poached pears, apricots, spiced pecans, cambozola, champagne vinaigrette and more yummy goodness
- pulled pork sandwich with garlic aioli 
- bilbao pizza (chorizo, mushrooms, bacon, garlic, cambozola) 
- ratatouille with goat cheese on naan 
- a mini banana cream pie 

As you can tell, my belly was content! 

Next time though, I'll pass on the banana cream pie. The banana flavouring tasted artificial, but to Stoney's defense - I don't think they bake their own desserts. Too bad, they don't bake their own desserts. If they did than this place would be heaven!

I can't wait to try this place for Sunday brunch... and all the other meals and snack times that exist!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, pasta, and pizza- I've never been disappointed even with their take out."}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT EVER!!!! their sandwich is sooooooooooooooo good!!!! i absolutely LOVE their sunday brunch!!!!!!! DELICIOUS!!!!! I will go there everyday if i can hahaha"}
{"text":"If you only have twenty bucks you can have an outstanding meal and still have change in your pocket. Pasta dishes are up there with the best anywhere. It is not the place to go for a night out, you will be in and out in an hour. You order your food before you are seated which confuses people the first time eating there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love Stoney's! After having only learned of the Oakville location last summer (and loving it!) I was so happy to see them expand to my 'hood! Big, bright, open and of course, a delicious menu, make this a welcome addition to the Queensway strip.  

Delicious sandwiches with high-end ingredients are the star of the menu IMO.  Alsacian & Florence St sandwiches are so yummy.  I hope they bring the Rosemary Crusted Pork Loin sandwich to this Etobicoke location ! Pizzas are also delicious, cooked perfectly with a thin crust and generous toppings.  Never had brunch there yet, but it's next on our list! And it's looks like they're prepared for a patio come summertime - hooray!

Prices a touch high, (for example, two entrees at lunch, without ordering drinks, comes out to $30) BUT I will gladly pay for the quality and will come back! Just don't go expecting regular sandwich shop prices.  Service is fantastic; smiling staff member greeting you upon entry is a nice touch."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in Oakville and it is well known. It's rare that you go there and it's not busy. The menu is fantastic no matter what meal you are there for. 

Their French toast is to die for! One of the best breakfast choices. 

Their pizzas. Oh my goodness, their pizzas. I crave them! They are all good, but my favourite is the one with Gorgonzola, figs and prosciutto. If you've ever had real pizza from Italy, you know this is the real deal. The crust is cooked perfectly everytime. They are the perfect size for sharing or taking some hoe to enjoy later. 

I really love their garden salad too. Something about the fresh spring mix and that dressing! Pairs well with their pizza. Also big enough to share with 2-3 people. 

I can understand how the set up can be a bit confusing. First you order your meal at the counter and pay for it. They give you a number and you pick your own table. You have to grab your own drink from the cooler and grab your own water from the counter. Cutlery is also on the counter next to the water. It's hit or miss if one of the wait staff bring it to you. Not a big deal though. It's a self serve restaurant. 

On the plus side, if you order a bottle of wine, they uncork it at the table and let you try a little before pouring everyone a glass like a typical restaurant. 

They have a cute little patio that overlooks Kerr Village. 

Overall, this restaurant is unique with its family style approach and more of a self serve atmosphere. Don't be fooled though, prices are that of a full service restaurant because the quality of the food is amazing. It's a laid back, casual atmosphere, but has the quality of a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Captain's seafood bowl with a Creemore...what more could you ask for. The quantity of seafood in the bowl is very generous and the sauce is marvelous. I could have eaten a gallon of it with bread, but the portion size is plenty big and some won't finish...well maybe...please sir can I have some more."}
{"text":"When we were looking for a place to grab lunch this place popped up on Yelp. I'm glad that we decided to eat here.

The restaurant is self serve. You order and pay for your food first at the main counter and then go find a seat. The staff there are friendly and the staff at the order counter was personable and was nice in explaining what he recommended.

We got the roasted lamb sandwich, and mushroom pizza. The lamb was tender and nicely cooked. The meat didn't have a strong smell that is sometimes associated with lamb. The mushroom pizza was also enjoyable. They give you a lot of mushrooms. I liked this, as some places skimp on the toppings. The portion sizes are big. One pizza is enough for two people.

I liked the ambiance of the place. Casual but welcoming. It was fairly busy for a Saturday early afternoon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here numerous times over the last few years- mostly for the Sunday brunch.  The portions are big enough to fill you up, no matter what you're ordering.  I typically go for the Eggs Benny which is on nice fresh bread rather than an English muffin.  The hollandaise is perfectly decadent.  So much flavor going on- delicious!  My boyfriend usually gets the slow roasted lamb sandwich- and I can say as a person who didn't really eat much lamb up until a few years ago, this sandwich will convert any non-lamb eater because it's to die for!

Sundays get ridiculously busy so realize that you're likely in for a bit of a wait not only to order, but also to get a table. I don't mind the cafeteria style dining (order and pay first, then find a table) - I'm used to that from when I lived abroad.  However I do know a lot of North Americans aren't quite used to it.  

Overall- I recommend this place to everyone, I've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Maybe a 4.5. I've always enjoyed whatever I ordered here or the original location in Oakville.
Naturally, the bread is fresh, everything is full of flavour and made of quality ingredients. Love that the taste is bold here. You have nearly 20 sandwiches to choose from, as well as pizza, soup and salad and brunch items on the weekend.
On my last visit to this location, they had a cajun shrimp sandwich special. Absolutely delicious and came with a side salad. The sleeve of beer was on special too, and altogether came in around $20 which is a great deal."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered sandwiches here, and luckily I've come generally midweek when it's not crazy as it is apparently on weekends.
There's a huge variety of sandwiches, and the toping parings are brilliantly thought out and delicious.
The only thing holding back the review a bit is that the meat is clearly pre-cooked. It's clearly to accommodate their format of quick service (and dealing with high volume of customers). It's understandable and positive in the sense of receiving your lunch in a timely way; however the eating experience suffers a little."}
{"text":"I've literally been going since Day 1 and am never disappointed.  

The Margherita Pizza is my all time fav - their pizza sauce is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This place is fire. Sandwiches are big, comes with wedges and an amazing sauce. My go to is the Flat Iron Steak but they also offer other great choices. A bit pricey but your paying for the quality. Perfect spot for brunch as well."}
{"text":"We were on a mission to find another brunch spot since sunny morning had a line out the door. We found this spot nearby and gave it a try. 
The food was good. The place is clean and new. 
The service is what knocked down their rating. 

Service is what it all comes down to and they just pissed me off. We ordered Santa Fe eggs n French toast with a chocolate milk and grape juice. $31 bucks. We didn't manage to finish so I was going to take my French toast home. Waiting to find a waitress I manage to wave someone down, she was carrying a wooden basket filled with cutlery wrapped in napkin ready to preset on tables. So I asked her, hi could I get a take out container for my food. She replies, sure give me a few minutes to get it for you. WATCHING THIS WAITRESS SET CUTLERY ONE BY ONE ON EACH EMPTY TABLE LIKE THERE WAS A DAMN LINEUP. I went n got the damn take out container myself. 

I'm sorry but am I wrong for feeling this way??? 
How are you in service and you deprive your customer because you prioritize setting the table over them."}
{"text":"Same great food as the one in Oakville. Love that there's another location - and especially here in Toronto. Although I feel that Oakville location's food is a bit better but could be only because it's my first love.

If you are looking for a tasty brunch location, this is the place to be. The portion size is large and will fill you up half way through your meal. I haven't tried everything on their menu but I keep coming back to my favourites. The panini breakfast sandwich is usually my go to dish but shouldn't pass on the margarita pizza either. I've also tried their tuna and chicken sandwiches, which are delicious. Sharing maybe the way to go to get a taste of a bit of everything.

Service is similar to a cafeteria style but your order is served to you. You place your order by the cashier and get a number. If it's not too busy, you can seat yourself. If it is busy, a host/ hostess will seat you first come first serve method by the seating area. Place your number on the table so it's visible to the servers and they will serve you when your order is ready. If you have ordered a drink, you can pick them  up by the \"bar\" station.

They also serve dinner there but I usually go for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I come here in the weekends from time to time for brunch. Never had a complaint about the food because it is quite spectacular. I actually found this place through Yelp back when I was just starting to use Yelp so it's got some sentimental hold on me.

I usually get the breakfast panini and the margarita pizza. So good. And the coffee is really good. Just be warned, the portion size is huge so you definitely won't go hungry. Yeah I get two dishes but I share because I love the pizza there.

A couple of tips: it is a order first and take a number. You can't save seats before ordering and you should not seat yourself. Find a wait staff to seat you because there's a seating system that works to get everyone seated by order number. The food will be brought out to you by the wait staff.

Only complaint is it's getting too crowded and will have to wait a bit for seating. This is another eat and go place. Not a place to chit chat people! Remember, you were in the same position waiting for seating not long before. Don't be mean. Eat your food and go so others can be seated."}
{"text":"I heart Stoney's

I wish, desperately, that this place was around back when I was in high school. Alas... it wasn't to be. If it were around back then I'd be here all the time. Every. Meal.

The slow roasted lamb sandwich is so. good. 

Yes, it's a bit pricey - but it's worth it. It's one of the best sandwiches I've had. The lamb is tender with great texture, the bread is fresh and delicious, and the caramelized onions complement the sandwich nicely.

The pizza is good - above average but not spectacular. Fresh ingredients, a nice crunchy crust - but the sandwiches are what gives Stoney's 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see a Stoneys so close to the cinemas.  The one in Oakville is fabulous.  Ordered the b-nut squash soup and grilled veggie sandwich.  Same food quality here that I expect from Stoneys and that's good!  Same seating rules in play here ie order first and then get your seat.  Some complain about the price of the food but it is made fresh to order and the quality of the ingredients is apparent.  Just do it...."}
{"text":"Lived in Oakville for over 8 years and finally decided to see if this place is worth the hoopla!  Came on a Tuesday night at 8pm.  Quiet and lots of seating.

Ordered pulled pork sandwich with side salad and shrimp and scallop fettuccine.  Side salad was a generous portion and sandwich was huge!! Big enough to share!!  Pasta was tasty.  Generous pieces of bacon with large chunks of scallops and shrimp laced with baby spinach and grape tomatoes in a creamy sauce.

Service is friendly and food comes quickly."}
{"text":"Eh, food was mostly great. But nothing about the experience was redeeming. Do yourself a favour and sit far away from the kitchen/service counter. The gazpacho was not special - fresh, spicy, but a little too watery. The fettucini a la chevre was large but delicious, creamy sauce, soft pasta, and the bread was the best thing on the dish. Will not return, the end."}
{"text":"If I could have one last meal before I die, it would be ANYTHING off the menu at Stoney's. A cute little cafe tucked away on Kerr St, this little gem is simply amazing. Service is fast and quick (even on the busiest days) and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. They are reasonably priced and their portions are quite large. In short, make sure you go to Stoney's!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Stoney's in so long and the last time was our company ordering in from the Kerr Street location.  I've only ever had the sandwiches which are really good because well they make their own breed since it's a bakery.

I've known about the Queensway location for some time and it's really close the the Cineplex but the last time we watched a movie we had went elsewhere to eat.  I wanted to specifically go to Stoney's because I've had them bookmarked for quite some time and they're so close so I had to eventually make the trip out.  

The parking is a little strange in that there's about 6 or 8 spots right out front but you have to go to the drive way on the east side because it's one way and goes clockwise around the building as opposed to the norm which is basically a counter clockwise drive around.  It would be nicer if they didn't have parking in the front because they have their patio facing the street but it's still a really nice spacious patio.  The main entrance is on the east side of the building, left if you're coming from the street.

Basically it wasn't that busy when we arrived so we didn't have to wait to be assigned seating.  You do have to go up and order what you'd like and pay for everything but then they prepare it and take it over to your table.  They give you a number so they know who they are taking the food to considering there's seating in and outside.  We told them we'd be outside.

I had ordered a burger and my wife had a the butternut squash and pear soup.  The burger I ordered although it was sort of expensive was a beauty.  It was called the \"Over the Top\" and while it doesn't appear on their menu on the website I was sort of interested in trying it.  Their menu is pretty diverse for a place that you may consider a bakery.  I'd have to say it's more of a restaurant than a bakery at least the Etobicoke location is because it feels much more like a sit down restaurant and not so much like a cafeteria.

The Over the Top burger was a burger with cheese, some sort of aioli, purple sauteed onions and lamb meat shavings.  Yes that's right I said LAMB on top.  This is why I had to order this burger because it's not often I eat lamb but I really do enjoy it.  These slices were thin kind of like the thin slices of roast beef you get in a pack of cold cuts but the taste... they do not take like roast beef that's for sure.  

The burger is juicy and very full of taste.  Between the aioli, onions and the lamb on top the flavors are just bursting through.  The lamb is sort of dry but still, very full of taste.  The juicyness of the burger and the aioli counter the dryness without making the burger all slippery inside.

The bun... well this place is known for their bread right?  I've never had a sandwich from Stoney's that sucked and it's probably because their bread is so good and fresh.  The bun was a shiny top that looked brushed possibly, either way it made the burger complete.  

I really enjoyed this burger and lamb topping off a burger is not something you see or can order every day which is why I had to have it.  Next time I go I think I'll have a pizza though only because there's more bread involved and their bread is really good.  I was surprised to see so much variety on their menu though like fish and other hot foods besides salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Came back here with Vivek, Mel C. and other friends and shared 4 pizzas and 2 bowls of mussels... it's still soooooo yummy!  Like I don't mean just mmmm omnomnom yummy.  I mean \"C is for Cookie\" OMNOMNOMNOMNOM NOM NOm Nom yummy!

One tip: Shrooms!  The shroom pizza is clearly the general fave.
2nd tip: The dill(io) and tomato mussels were not as good as whatever the 3rd choice of which I can not remember at this time (garlic something something if I remember correctly).  The previous two were only..meh.

I've GOT to come back to sample the sandwiches that Vivek keeps talking about."}
{"text":"Have been to this place (a jewel on Kerr Street) at least 10 times, and I am never disappointed.   I get a little bit annoyed at the lineup during peak times, but that quickly goes away once I get my \"number\" and proceed to a seat.

Everything I've tried is good:  salads, sandwiches, pizza, desserts.

I love the complimentary lemon water they provide too!

Recommended A+"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon for late lunch.  They were about 1/3 full so we had no problems getting a table.  I ordered the basic burger and my partner ordered the steak sandwich and glass of red wine.  Wait time for our order was approx 20 mins which was acceptable.  The burger was the best I have had in a very long time it was nicely charred and well seasoned well done but still juicy.  The bun was fresh and held the burger perfectly.  My partners steak sandwich was equally as good..however next time I would ask the bread to be toasted longer.  The steak was lean but tender and they included lots of mushrooms which I like.  The potatoes accompanying both dishes were tasty and not greasy or heavy.  We will be back to try the soups and pasta next."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches! I've never had anything here that wasn't good, after several visits.

They use a nice combination of ordering at the counter with a server to handle you at your table once you're done ordering. Service was friendly and attentive and food arrived quickly.

Thanks and we'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried again tonight. Never will I ever come agian. The workers are rude when I told them how I liked my steak. I just wanted to confirm to make sure we were on the same page both the cooks and the girls doing cash roller their eyes. Not worth the wait and not worth the frustration someone needs to train these \"children \" some work ethics..."}
{"text":"i love this place, been here more than i can remember. hands down the best place for soups, salads and even some desserts. only downside is parking and its hard to find seats."}
{"text":"What is the hype about?! The only thing worth mentioning is the fresh bread. Everything else is mediocre. Most of the food we ordered were not finished. The tomato sauce on the pizza and pasta was too sweet. The beef burger was overly seasoned with spices. The butternut squash tasted terrible. Equally worse is how cold the restaurant was. They left a door open so there was a cold breeze that pretty much turned our food into icicles after 5 mins. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Second visit had the salmon burger topped with shrimp with aeoli and avocado... a most delicious thing of beauty. The side salad was OK, balsamic dressing was excellent though the spring mix was too heavy on arugula. Not a rocket man, myself though YMMV."}
{"text":"Their Americano pizza is fantastic, and gives the other pizza places on kerr a run for their money! My two kids love the baked goods, but if my ex wife ever found out how many cookies I get them, I'd be more fire roasted than the pizza!  Haha"}
{"text":"Very reasonable in terms of prices, as well as good selection of sandwiches, pizzas, pastas etc. Good beer on tap as well as options for coffee, espresso's etc. Expect a bit of a lineup at the cash to place your order if it's busy as there are no real wait staff.

The prices and pizzas will bring me back for sure."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast joint and saw all the great reviews for this place.  Checked it out today.  We had the tuna sandwich, greek salad, and their version of eggs benedict.  The tuna with dill and olive were awesome, the feta on the greek salad was very flavourful.  the eggs benedict came on foccaccia and was very filling.  Service was friendly.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches and friendly staff. It takes sometime to wait for table because of crowds in lunch time, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast and lunch place but it is a bit cramped and extremely busy.  

You have to line up and order at the cash before sitting down so it causes a bit of a backlog.

However the quality of food is outstanding.  Had something that included smoked salmon with eggs benedict.  It was a huge portion and was real fresh smoked salmon (unlike the salty deli style smoked salmon).  I would visit again but on a less busy day."}
{"text":"This is a must have whenever I come to Toronto! 
The chicken Florence is the best the taste is also delicious and I'm still guessing spices are used.
Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Stoney's is one of my go-to places in Oakville. Although quite simple, the chicken caesar salad is awesome! It has the balsamic reduction underneath and it really makes the salad. I've also had pizza and sandwiches here - all delicious! Worth the visit (and wait) for food :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner on a Friday night. Wasn't that busy. Got the blackened chicken sandwich. Epic!! Girlfriend got the surf and turf burger. So tasty!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria style joint. Brunch is excellent. Took one bite of my eggs Benny and immediately decided in my mind to come back again another day. Eggs Benny was awesome. Stoney ' s omelette was awesome. Generous portions. Saw a glimpse of the pizza too. Looked tasty. was quite busy on a Sunday but the wait wasn't any longer than what you would expect at any busy brunch spot on a weekend."}
{"text":"We visited for Saturday morning breakfast and, overall, it was an 'A-OK' experience. It wasn't super and extraordinarily great, but it was pretty decent and it got the feed-us-breakfast job done. Located just west of Islington Ave and The Queensway, this location has lots of seating, and great for groups and families. It's clean, service is courteous and quick, and the food is alright.

We ordered the 'Stoney's Omelette' and an egg sandwich. Everything was very fresh, and was, overall, a decent breakfast. It was tasty, but the flavours aren't anything out of ordinary. However, portions are pretty generous and the quality of ingredients are obviously well managed.

Overall, a good decent breakfast spot for the family (it's a good atmosphere for kids too). Prices are average, and there's a handful of parking spots (although it could be a tight squeeze). Not bad - if we had no other choice, we'd be back, but there are definitely other options in the area I'd rather explore first."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to go with friends and catch up over a meal...this is NOT the place.  Food is good, but it does not compensate for the extremely rude service.  After ordering and paying for my meal, I secured a table for 4 while my friends found parking.  I received a warning from the server, that if a group of 4 came in I would be asked to move.  At that time, there were 3 people in line.  Really Stoney's?  Way to make your customers feel welcome!  We all have choices on where to eat...we will not be choosing you again!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch on Monday. The place is in this cute area on Kerr Street. I found a street metered parking and realized I didn't have any Canadian changes! So I moved to the lot on Washington and paid with a credit card. Phew! Anyways, this place has a cafeteria style, so you order and pay first, then wait to be seated. Since I was with my baby and waiting for a friend to come, they let me sit down first. I ordered curried chicken sandwich, which was decent. The bread was delicious, too. They have a wheelchair access bathroom so I pushed the stroller in to change diapers. If I'm in the area again, I would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"To start with, the staff was fantastic which includes all three of the people with whom I interacted.  I'm pretty sure I messed up when I ordered, but they corrected it cheerfully without even accepting my offer to pay the difference.  Let this be a lesson to those of you with consistent problems with places \"always screwing up your order\".  The problem might be you. 
So I get the blackened chicken sandwich.  For 11 bucks, which is maybe 7 or 8 American right now, I got a sandwich that was nearly the size of a grinder.  It was spicy, drippy, warm deliciousness on a big, chewy ciabatta bun."}
{"text":"Great location-Amazing food and Good service.This place has been reviewed and rated so high already and therefore it doesn't need vouching but I do feel like writing a review since this place has become my new summer FAV!


Great tasting food.The salads are fresh and full of flavor.They are huge in size and absolutely shareable.Sandwiches are to die for, so far I have tried the lamb, the grilled chicken and salmon sandwich.All of them are assembled with lots of fresh ingredients and crunchy vegetables.Their outstanding breads make all the difference.Pizzas here are pretty standard and worth a try.My personal favorites are the sandwiches and salads here.


So basically this place is a no tip restaurant you come here order your meal and get a number and look for a table.You eat with real cutlery and china and at the end leave the plates on the table and leave.Server come and serve you and it's OBVIOUSLY courteous to leave tip when leaving satisfied.

The bathrooms and clean and there is plenty of paid parking across the restaurant and I have always managed to get a spot even at the busiest time.The servers are quick and friendly and they do have a small patio with 4/5 tables for outdoor seating.

Overall when in Oakville this place is definitely worth a stop especially during summers when you crave light foods."}
{"text":"It's five star for sure ! 
Lamb sandwich was amazing and Caesar salad was crisp chilled romaine & had Excellent flavour. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is a mix of fast food and sit down restaurant.  Kind of like Williams but more upscale.  You order at the counter.  There is a good selection of foods.   They will come out and deliver it to your table.  There is a counter with water jugs to get your own water.  The place is nicely decorated and clean.  Food was just ok.  Quite honestly, I went a few weeks ago so it wasn't something I really remembered. lol  Service wise, it was great.  The lady at the front was really nice and patient with all the questions we asked."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and the sandwiches are amazing. Order first and then sit down. Service was friendly. Pizza is also worth trying. Gets full easily if you go at peak times. Certainly a place to hit up for a quick, casual, bite to eat in oakville."}
{"text":"L'endroit est très joli, classe mais cosy (on y va en tenue décontractée sans soucis!), on commande à la caisse et on va s'asseoir avec son numéro, la nourriture est très bonne et raisonnable niveau prix!

Le gros point négatif de ma note est surtout que la serveuse n'avait pas prit en compte ma commande, et m'avait préparer un sandwich, elle vient en me disant qu'elle a oublié et me propose le sandwich et quand je lui dit non elle lève les yeux au ciel! hé ho, faut pas déconner quand même, le but d'un resto c'est bien de manger ce que l'on veut!"}
{"text":"I quickly did a search on places to grab a bite when spending the night in Oakville recently and Stoney's came up near the top.  I can see why!  Listed as a sandwich shop (and I love my carbs) it was actually so much more than that!  The interior was beyond cute.  Order at the counter and take a seat and someone will bring you your food - the concept was a bit lost on us when we first arrived.  Wasn't sure if we should take a seat, wait to be seated, etc.  Finally someone came over and explained the procedure to us.  

They served beer and wine along with delicious sandwiches, soups, a daily burger special, pizza, and a small handful of entrees.  Oh, and don't forget the wonderful desserts.  A bit of time went into making our decision - I was starving and everything looked beyond delicious!  I settled with the burger of the day - a well seasoned ground chicken burger served with yummy bacon, avocado, cheese and the usual lettuce and tomato.  I also ordered a side salad that had the most delicious Champagne vinaigrette on it.  I was informed that all of the dressings are made in house and that was very evident in the flavor.  

Hubby got the Rosemary Crusted Pork Loin sandwich and declared it was some of the best pork he had ever eaten.  Just make sure to grab a napkin because both of the sandwiches were very messy.  The highlight of the sandwiches imo is the balsamic reduction smeared on the plate next to my sandwich.  They sell the reduction at the counter, it is that good.  After we got done eating our sandwiches - which took a while because they are HUGE - we decided we needed just one more look at the pastry display.  I couldn't resist and neither could DH.  We grabbed two items to go and shared them later that evening.  The best of the two was the Lemon Ricotta cup that hubby got (and kindly shared with me).  The brownie I got was good but nothing special.  

The very best part of our experience was the employees who have obvious pride in the food they serve.  Two of the staff were very friendly and we quickly began telling them about our adventures ahead of us.  One of the girls was from the Windsor area which got us talking about Detroit and Windsor being neighbors.  Friendly conversation to end the evening made the meal all the more better!

I will go out of my way on any future trips to Toronto and beyond just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the sandwiches at Stoney's. My favourite is the Balsamic Chicken. The bacon and the balsamic vinegar really make this sandwich complete. During my last visit, I had my usual sandwich but I also ordered a pizza special to go (for dinner later on), which had grilled chicken, bacon and onions on it (and a few other toppings which I can't remember). The pizza sauce is really good and they are generous with the cheese. I haven't yet had the opportunity to try their pasta (it is served after 5 p.m. on the weekends) so we'll have to make a point of going to Stoney's later in the day to try it. Service is always friendly and helpful. During our last visit, I ordered my pizza to go and they were kind enough to delay making it and kept it warm on top of their oven for me. What a nice touch.
They also have home-made desserts (spotted this by accident during a previous visit). I enjoyed a Hello Dolly bar which was so good, I was inspired to research how I could make them myself. (I haven't actually tried making them yet but did find a few recipes so will tackle this soon).
Their sister location in Etobicoke offers a similar (if not the same) menu. It's very spacious and lots of free parking (especially next door in the parking lot for the bank)."}
{"text":"Our family picked this place after seeing it on You Gotta Eat Here. We were very happy with the food. Between 8 of us we ordered a cheese pizza, a 4 mushroom pizza & a Giuseppe pizza which consisted of different lunch meats. The pizzas were cooked to perfection! We also ordered the daily special sandwich with roasted chicken roasted peppers and onions and bacon, the daily burger special which was a patty made out of salmon & shrimp with bacon on a ciabatta, a roasted lamb sandwich, and a Calabria sandwich. The goat cheese salad was fantastic. 
The only thing we didn't care for was the ordering process. You have to order at the counter off the boards and pay and then they seat you and bring the food to your table. It feels disorganized and if a line starts to build you feel rushed. 
After all the food, iced tea and water and three beers the total was $150. 
The food was to die for and we would definitely go back and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The person who was seating people at the restaurant was rude and arrogant. A customer had seated herself while her husband was getting the food and the seater removed the customer from her seat and made a rude hand movement. The customers left. We also left after witnessing this situation. Poor customer service."}

{"text":"It's my second time here and still busy as ever. The first time I came after a race in Burlington around 11am and it wasn't too busy but today there was a longer line.  The food here is exceptional and they have a lot of different choices for brunch and lunch including omlettes, pizzas, salads, sandwiches and crepes.  It is a counter service restaurant,  so you go up and order off the big menus on the wall. After you pay for the order you can go find a seat and then they will bring the food to your table.  

We found this out the hard way or more like the rude way. My bf and I went by for a quick bite on the way to niagara and I went to order while he got us 2 waters and went to sit down. A very rude waitercame up to him and said he couldn't sit there because it's first come first serve,  there are literally about 15 tables unoccupied.  My bf said so I have to stand and wait until she pays before I sit down even though there are many tables and he said yes. 

My bf was holding two glasses of water and didn't want to leave them there so started walking towards me and the waiter rudely asked why he was leaving his sunglasses on the table. He then tried to toss the glasses on top of the 2 glasses of water. My bf responded that he had no hands and he'll come back for them unless he wanted to bring them to me since he was being so upright about it. He huffed and puffed and picked up the glasses,  came over to me and with out warning threw them into my hands and said did you lose these and walked away. 

After this he continuously gave my bf the stink eye while we were lining up to buy the food. We ordered and there were still multiple tables available. We are sitting at a table outside where we originally wanted to sit and for the rest of lunch he didn't even try to come back to fill our waters or anything. He just went to all the tables around us and looked the other way at our table. 

My bf isn't a confrontational person or rude in anyway, he's from the south and is very kind to everyone he meets or passing on the street. He was really upset by this encounter and continued assaults after he did what the gentlemen demanded. 

It's upsetting and just made our fun lunch date before niagara have a negative start. 

This review is strictly for this one persons service and not for the food which I would have given a 4 stars at least.  Smh I'm sad that we won't be back here again after this, the food is really good and I spoke about it for days to my bf when planning our Niagara trip.

****
It made me so frustrated that while we were waiting for our food and sitting on the patio trying to not let his angry looks towards us bother us, another patron walks up and sits down at a table across from us while her partner went inside to line up and order. This same waiter came out 3 times and looked over the tables and noticed hers without a table number and went back inside without doing anything. That makes me so disappointed with this establishment or more so with that waiter and 1 other that was also in charge of the patio that did nothing. It makes me question why my bf was hassled and the other patron wasn't."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place and oh my! We love it! Haven't been dissappointed with anything that we've had. We try and bring friends whenever possible,sharing the deliciousness! We hope they don't change a thing,except the law about having your dog sitting in patio...:(
Looking forward to our next visit:)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place ages ago!

Came here on a Saturday at around 3pm, there was a line up and 2/3 of the tables were occupied. Cannot imagine how busy it gets during lunch hours. But at least I could use the time to think about what to eat while lining up. 

At this restaurant, you need to go up to the counter to order. So if you come here with a friend, one person can order while the other grab a table first. They will give you a number so the waiter can deliver your food to your table when is ready. Water is self-served as well at the front. 

The lady at the cashier was very welcoming and when I asked her what a ciabatta is she asked someone to grab the bread to show me :)

We ordered two sandwiches (Alsacian Chicken$11.25 & Rosemary Crusted Pork $10.50) and a quinoa salad $6. 
This is my first time here so I did not know that their sandwiches are HUGE. I would not have ordered the salad if I know beforehand because we didn't end up finishing it.

I don't usually enjoy eating sandwiches with sauces inside because I find it too messy. But these sandwiches are finger licking good!! The meat was tendered and juicy and the sauces were very delicious. Not too heavy and the flavours balanced well. Each plate comes with your own olive oil and balsamic vinegar for your bread in it. 

I am going to go back and try the other sandwiches for sure. Maybe their pizzas too because seems like a lot of people are ordering that as well. Just need to avoid their peak hours."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Stoney's Bread Company: the food, the ambiance, value, and the service. That's a win in my books and it certainly made my trip to Oakville extra worthwhile. 

When we entered we had to go over to the main counter and kitchen to order. There's a charm about the interior here. It's warm inside with all the natural lighting coming in and the wooden tables and chairs. There were a lot of choices foodwise to choose from: from pastas, salads, burgers, and sandwiches. There were daily specials too and we went with their daily special pizza and soup. Both arrived quickly and were super delicious and fresh. 

The fettuccine alfredo really impressed me. It was really rich, creamy, and cheesy. The pasta was perfectly aldente and had a ton of veggies which is my favourite. There was spinach, and sun dried tomato, and there were jumbo shrimp. It was a loaded pasta dish and the garlic toast was a nice addition. I mean, they're a 'bread company' for good reason! The pizza was also excellent. The dough was perfect and while it was thin crusted, held up all the hefty toppings, and had a nice chew to it. The toppings were all fresh: ham, artichokes, red peppers, chicken breast, red onion, and bacon. The tomato sauce had a nice sweetness. Overall, a great pizza, and can easily be shared. Portion sizes were excellent here. They really don't skimp out on anything and you definitely won't leave hungry!

Other items such as the salads and sandwiches also look great from a quick eye-test. Service was extremely friendly, and everyone looked pleased to serve you, which came to my delight despite being a half service restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfasts  - love the pea meal bacon and scrambled eggs sandwich. The omelettes are also delicious! Go early."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favourite places in the area; for breakfast, brunch, lunch and anything in between. The quality of the food is still excellent."}
{"text":"Warning: Sunday mornings are BUSY. Don't come if you're in a rush.

Stoney's is an established restaurant so I'll refrain from raving about how good the food is for a bit and describe the experience I had instead.

At 11am on a Sunday morning, the lineup went right out the front door. Having made the 25 minute trek from Mississauga, I wasn't going to let this deter me. 

There are actually 2 lineups at Stoney's. The first line is to go to the cashier to order your food. This took about 35-40 minutes. After ordering, you're given a table # and you wait in the bar area while your food is prepared. Ideally, your food will be prepared at around the same time a table will be freed up. This took another 20-25 minutes, pushing the total time from entering to being served to 1 hour. 

When you're dealing with wait times this long, you gotta ask yourself - is it really worth it? As a first-timer, I've gotta say yes, yes it was. I ordered one of their signature sandwiches - the Rosemary Crusted Pork Loin. Amazing. Portion size is huge - you won't be left hungry after having one of these sandwiches. 

Service was pretty much as good as it gets with a restaurant this busy - you could tell the waiters had a lot of experience weaving through crowds. At times it felt a little cramped, but there's not much you can do about that. While the line went right through the dining area, the tables were distanced enough to not detract from the dining experience. 

They have a little patio out on the street-front to accommodate a greater capacity in the summer months, giving diners a nice view of Kerr Village. On cooler days, however, you can opt to sit on the patio to to shorten your wait time for a table (which is what I did on my visit).

Overall, a 1 hour wait time is quite long, but if you do decide to eat at Stoney's, you can do so without having any reservations about the quality of the food. It's great.

Ps. the crowd did seem to die down by the time I left, around 12:15pm. I'd recommend going a little later, or perhaps even visit on a weekday if you're tighter on time."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with friends and family. And each sandwich has been a winner! You enter the small restaurant and can see the chefs and cooks feverishly working away in the back. This confirms that the sandwiches are not frozen and being re-heated. But rather made on the spot. Not that I had any doubt about their authenticity in the first place! I think the only complaint would be the size of the sandwiches. I know, I am crazy for complaining! But as a petit woman trying to finish all that bread and filling goodness is difficult, and sometimes you end up throwing your money away because you can't finish. Albeit a minor complaint, it will not stop me from going and visiting again. It has been a while..."}
{"text":"This placed failed me again!! Idk I used to like this place but not anymore!! Maybe the cook changed or something nothing taste like before!"}
{"text":"Came here with my brother and it was just ok.

The soup we each ordered was so sweet we couldn't eat more than a few bites. I usually don't return food I don't enjoy but this was real real bad.

I went back up to the counter and let the guy behind the counter know. He tasted a bit from the big batch and agreed it was disgusting. 

He did replace the soup with another option which honestly was just as bad. While I appreciated the gesture, I just didn't want to bother complaining again. 

Felt like it was a waste of money and time.

Would not return."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING!
Always get the balsamic reduction when ordering sandwiches. Its a nice dipping sauce for their freshly baked bread.
Be prepared to spend a little more than you usually would for a sandwich but it is definitely worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Happened to show up on a Monday night and I'm not going to lie, I was unimpressed.

I'm not sure why this place has so many great reviews. Maybe I'm spoiled because I live downtown Toronto where North of Brooklyn makes a beautiful margherita pizza (for $9 more, side note: it's also a larger sized pizza). And California Sandwiches is up the street and has a mean veal sandwich with tomato sauce that is to die for. 

Air circulation could be improved, it was a little warm. The food was not great. It was definitely made fresh to order, but could be greatly improved. Margherita pizza was a flat out disappointment. Not a proper margherita pizza. The chicken sandwich I got was sickly sweet and I'm not sure why. My boyfriend and his dad got lucky ordering pasta.

The person that greeted us was incredibly nice, but I think the fact that there was only 4 people in the restaurant and then 2 were in athletic wear...made a not so great impression. The \"cafeteria-style\" ordering threw me off. I've been to a few places that had a similar structure of billing, but was done a lot better. I had a lot higher expectations and everything about this place was extremely underwhelming."}
{"text":"Had their signature Stoney's breakfast. The food was bang average. Think their Oakville location has better tasting food."}
{"text":"Although, I'm not necessarily a fan of the cafeteria style ordering, I do love the food.  The food is quite well done.  The general service is good but why do we have to order thru the front?  Just make it a normal ordering system since you drop off the food at my table anyway.  I also don't like to pay for my tip at the beginning of my meal.  The food is amazing as expected though."}
{"text":"Stoney's is the place to go for Canadian/Italian food. But I like the Oakville location better not because it's the original, but because I can taste and see the difference between them. The portions are huge (especially the bread) and it doesn't get crowded which I like :)"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch
Specialty: American with a modern Mediterranean influence
Menu items: Southern Style Pulled Pork and Regina & Saltimbocca Pizzas

I discovered Stoney's during a re-run of You Gotta Eat Here!. Upon watching the show and discovering the great concept, food and atmosphere this place offered, I immediately made it a point to make it to Oakville.

Stoney's Bread Company hides just south of the QEW on a quiet and lovely neighbourhood with a welcoming outdoor patio by the entrance. On arrival, and operating similarly as Famoso Pizzeria, with guests ordering at the counter then being served at their tables, one finds a rather extensive menu with big flavours and freshly made meals.

Mostly known for making their own doughs and breads in house, after all Stoney's is a bread company, we decided to default to the good ol' carbs.

Our carb fest began with the Regina Pizza, a thin-crust style pizza topped with tomato sauce, caramelized onions, figs, prosciutto, mozzarella and gorgonzolla cheese.

The pizza had the perfect sweet-to-savory balance with the figs, gorgonzolla cheese and prosciutto being the stars of the dish. In one bite, one would get the chewy sweetness of the figs followed but the pungent and creamy taste from the melted cheeses. The crust was crispy golden, while the centre was soft but not soggy.

Though the Regina Pizza was my favourite, I also enjoyed the Saltimbocca Pizza. Topped with grilled chicken, mushrooms, prosciutto and mozzarella on a bed of tomato sauce, the cheese from this pizza beautifully oozes out taking the mushrooms and chicken as its prisoners, alla NYC style.

From pizza to sandwiches, our last crab-indulging meal from Stoney's was the Southern Style Pulled Pork. The sandwich is served on a lovely focaccia bread, spread with garlic aioli and stuffed with a bourbon BBQ sauce marinated pulled pork. The bread had a tasty outter shell with a soft and spongy centre and the pork was tender and perfectly cooked. I however found the bourbon sauce a bit overpowering on the dish. A salad addition or the inclusion of some leafy greens would have balanced it out nicely.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Came here with my mother, husband and baby for brunch/lunch. We were all quite happy with our choice. I think I was the \"winner\" by ordering the french toast. It was practically half a loaf of bread, covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter. My husband ordered the Stoney's breakfast, which is your basic eggs, toast, bacon, etc, meal. My mother ordered the omelet. Huge portions, BUT at around $11-$13 per breakfast meal, it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine, I'm not sure the price is warranted, especially since it's a order at the counter, then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place. People were friendly and service was good (for what it was). I would give it a try if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for different menu items.  Everything is delicious, but the real magic is in the sandwiches.  The roasted lamb sandwich is extremely good with the real winner on the whole menu being the nové chicken sandwich.  It's always fresh, always hot, and I would say that it is possibly the best sandwich I've ever had anywhere!

Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting downtown Oakville."}
{"text":"Ordered the Giuseppe pizza and it was some of the worst pizza I ever had.  Would not recommend.

Friends ordered the margarita pizza and it was also terrible.  It looked like a piece of saganaki from a Greek restaurant. 

Definitely not the same restaurant as Oakville, which was a 10/10 for the same food."}
{"text":"They make a pasta that would embarrass most Italian restaurants..Really!  I was in the neighbourhood on business, and a quick check of the Yelp app revealed I was about a Stoney's throw away ;-).

The place is really nicely set up, comfortable in every way.  The open kitchen in the corner is where you order from a variety of different offerings ranging from pastas to burgers and sammys.

I decided it was time to throw a stringent test at them: they had a Shrimp and Scallop Fettucine on the chalkboard menu-but wait!  I wanted a maranara sauce instead of the white sauce. No problem!

This was incredibly good!  First, the shrimp were huge, plentiful and perfectly cooked. So often, an authentic Italian restaurant will cook the shrimp a bit too much.  The scallops also were tender, moist and cooked to perfection.  Add an ample helping of al dente pasta, and a load of garlic, and top it with a couple slices of garlic toast.  Excellent!

That's all. That was enough!  I was stuffed and carbed up to the point where I needed to pull off the 400 and take a little nap..."}
{"text":"No wonder it has been said that they have the best sandwhiches in oakville!
Coz they really do, we got Chicken Alascian and another one and they were both really tasty and flavourful. We ordered coffee with the food and it came before, i was thinking it would come with the food as it is usually done in breakfast places.

Their coffees were light which I am not a big fan of. This is my beef with pretty much all the breakfast places. Other than that, the service was good, serving size was good, the ambiance was pretty good as well.

Suggestion to the owners: If you give the bill after the food, customers will be more generous in tipping. There is not enough to consider when we are paying the bill before food and service."}
{"text":"Peameal sandwich never disappoints!  A favorite place to eat when I am in Oakville.  Sandwiches are always made fresh, desserts are way too tempting and service is efficient."}
{"text":"Great in terms of prices, atmosphere.

everything's either a sandwich or on bread.  Thought you might want to be warned.

good coffee (cheap espresso) and pretty good desserts.

All in all a fun place.  Older crowd and some younger folk too.  always busy it seems.  or maybe i just usually go at the wrong times."}
{"text":"I've been going to stoney's for years and its always fantastic. The food is incredibly fresh and delicious, personal favorite is the roast lamb or New York Steak Sandwich. This place charges as much as Quiznos but is way better quality.

 Only down side is that its always packed! Good luck getting a seat when you go for lunch or dinner. If you're in Oakville make sure you come get a sandwich."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and burgers at dinner time were delicious and make it worth going to Stoney's as quickly as possible! :) The jewel of the menu was the clam chowder in a tomato base. It was the most delicious soup I've had at a restaurant in over 2 years. If you enjoy chowder it's a must. Come hungry though because the portions are huge. Oh and thanks for having local beer from Amsterdam available! 
Cheers and thanks for the delicious foods"}
{"text":"By the look of the menu, it seemed there would be a lot of items worth trying. Ordered the blackened chicken sandwich. Super bland, blackening had very little flavour. The dill lemon aoili was non existent, added nothing what so ever. My girl had the balsamic chicken sandwich. She only had half of it, wasn't impressed by the lacking amount of goat cheese. We both had caesar salads, which were lack luster. Had grape tomatoes on it, which is confusing. And considering this place is a bread company, why no croutons? The dressing hardly tasted like a caesar dressing. I don't think it had any anchovy..... just tasted like a garlic mayo. The menu has great looking stuff but way too bland and poorly executed. Wouldn't waste my money there again, 2 stars."}
{"text":"My go to Sunday brunch place. There's always long line up so be strategic in terms of time for your visit! Even if you wait, it is worth it. 

Their generous portion always serve my Sunday breakfast AND lunch"}
{"text":"The food was FINE. $35 for kale salad and salmon on soggy toast OVER PRICED. I tipped a couple bucks to a tired server, since you order and mostly help yourself I wouldn't suggest tipping (server was grumpy).  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I wish the pizzas we ordered looked remotely like the photos they have on here. Pretty sure we were served store-bought pizza shells with store-bought pizza sauce. Low quality ingredients = low quality pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fast service. Clean and friendly. A little gem in Oakville. Recommend. Stopped in and got the peameal bacon sandwich. You order and pay at the counter and they bring it to you.  My sandwich was well made and large enough that I took some home."}
{"text":"Save your money!!  Much better choices in the neighbourhood. This is not my first time here. In fact I think it has been my fourth or fifth. What has happened to the quality?  What has happen to the service with a smile?
I ordered the Quesadilla. It arrived with red Onions inside. Problem is that I do not care for onions. I sent it back politely however they argued with me that it comes that way. My point is that the menu does not indicate that. They finally agreed and made another. The place had 5 tables max of patrons. Everyone at my table finished their meals before mine arrived. No apologies. Nothing just sat it down and walked away. And a poor excuse for a Quesadilla I might add. Poor filling and flavourless. I really get the feeling that today's lunch was an inconvenience for the staff. Poor quality and poor attitudes. I work hard for my money. Time to go somewhere where it is appreciated."}
{"text":"Impressive.  The grilled chicken sandwich was delicious... best of the three sandwiches we ordered, the other two were the blackened chicken and roasted lamb.  The other two were great, especially the blackened chicken but the grilled chicken won me over.  I was saddened to find out the Sunday Brunch items are only available on Sunday during brunch... which is obvious but still sad... :p   ... but i have to say, i was pleasantly surprised to find how delicious the other sandwiches were... 
The service was great, very friendly and considering the busy crowd, we got seated much quicker than expected.
The prices were reasonable.. not expensive... just right...and considering the high quality of the food, worth every dollar... :)"}
{"text":"Had a delightful meal. Pizza was very, very good. Salads are fresh and huge.  East coast clam chowder was different that what we are used to eating but the tomato-based flavor was tasty. Waiters were welcoming to this Texan."}
{"text":"After hearing so many people raving about the Oakville location I was super excited to try this place out. Unfortunately, I was there pretty late and they ran out of bread. :(

I had their special of the day; some pizza with chicken and goat cheese smothered in barbecue sauce. When the order arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes! Is this a single server portion?? An entire 10+ inch pizza with enough toppings to make Mt Everest look small! While the pizza was pretty tasty, I've had better. The crust was a little to crispy for my liking however it was very thin. I guess they had to make the crust hardy in order to be able to hold up against the mountain of toppings on it.

I also tried one of their chicken salads. The chicken was a tad on the dry side but very flavourful. Again, the portion is quite ridiculous.

All in all, a great place with good food and fantastic value. Definitely drop by if you are in the area, you will not regret."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up. Sandwiches were pretty decent. Great location to go right beside the cinema. I probably wouldn't make the drive out on purpose, but a good option in the area"}
{"text":"So good! They offer takeout, but if you decide to eat in they have lots of tables and windows that show downtown Oakville's signature sparkly lit trees. The interior design is a little different, but it gives it a fun feel and I like that the kitchen is open to the room.

When you enter you need to go order first, I'd recommend having a friend pour some waters and secure a table.

Their sandwiches are so perfect; soft, tender, and absolutely tasty. I think their portions are perfectly sized to fill 1 person, though my boyfriend and I split it. We also ordered a pasta, which stood out to me over every pasta I've ever eaten due to the delicious crunch the veggies added. So good!"}
{"text":"Wow! I challenge you to find a better sandwich. After ordering from an exceedingly cheery man at the register, we waited for a table. Thank you Stoney's for not seating people until they've ordered, or we wouldn't have been able to sit while eating. We grabbed a couple glasses of water from the self-serve pitchers on the counter, and not long after our sandwiches arrived.

Not only do they look appetizing, the flavor is out of this world. My daughter ordered a balsamic chicken sandwich, and actually sighed with delight after the first bite. Moist chicken,  generously topped with greens, roasted red peppers and more, drizzled with balsamic. Likewise, the grilled vegetable sandwich i ordered was bite after bite of deliciousness. Loaded with veggies, served on wonderful thick slices of grilled bread that might have been from Heaven. Bursting with flavor. Y u m !!! I should have asked what kind of balsamic they use, because I think I could drink it from the bottle. Slightly sweet, full-flavored goodness.

We easily could have shared a sandwich, as they are large. But where would the fun be in that? Now we have dinner already prepared for tonight. And I foresee dinner being excellent this evening!"}
{"text":"Was thrilled to know that I didn't have to trek all the way to Oakville anymore when they opened up at the Queensway. Been here several times, always a good experience. Really good flavours, really fresh ingredients, tastes gourmet and doesn't leave you feeling heavy. Get busy during lunch hours. But you don't feel guilty after having your meal. You order at the cash and then get a number. Sit down and they'll bring out your food. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Went to Stoney's again today and the server brought my vanilla crepes with the strawberry sauce. Her thumb was in the sauce and she took it out and played off like it wasn't! Even though you could clearly see a gap in the sauce where her thumb was. The sauce gathered and the area disappeared, and 2 other friends noticed it too. We all waited for her to say something but she played it off like nothing was wrong...  she hid her pink nail polished hands, tried to discreetly wipe it on her pants/apron... gross & unprofessional! Didn't bother saying anything, just ate half of the too sweet meal anyways!"}
{"text":"I'd say it's a tad pricey for what it is, but otherwise fantastic.

Delicious food, great selection, not too crowded, and loved the feel of the restaurant.

Looking forward to trying the brunch"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend with a group of friends for lunch and it was delicious!!!. All orders freshly made and full of flavour. Everyone enjoyed their meals, and we all decided to make the trip back to try other items on the menu. Only issue I found was the wait staff were out to lunch themselves... a little lost in space :s"}
{"text":"This was my second time here. It was good, but not great. All of the food sounds like it will be really great, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped and as the other reviews led me to believe it would be. I had a fettuccini plate with chicken, goat cheese, and peppers in a rose sauce. I was expecting that there would be chunks of goat cheese, but there wasn't. There was just a faint taste of goat cheese in the rose sauce. My husband got a pepperoni pizza, which had decent quality pepperoni and cheese, but the crust was a bit soggy. I was looking for traditional thin crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. 

Overall, it just left me feeling meh. If this is an Oakville mainstay, if this is as good as it gets in Oakville, we may as well move."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get pleasantly surprised by restaurants and this was one of them. It has been awhile since I had a Burger that was worth talking about, usually we come here for salads and sandwiches, which don't get me wrong are really good and would deserve a four star review on their own. If your not a big Burger fan try the Maple Salmon with Bacon, they have a maple sauce on it that is just amazing. But enough about Salads you don't read my reviews for that. 

I was worried it was going to be another crap burger probably frozen, but the fact it had shrimp on it I thought I would try it since I was starving. 

This was one of the best burgers I have had in the city, could have been cooked a little less time, but by no means was it dry or over cooked. 

The patty was obviously made in house and yes this burger can be a hand full, but so much flavour, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and together with the melt in your mouth beef it was just unbelievable, they top it off with an avocado sauce and a freshly made bun........ You know what I want another one now!!! 

Maybe it was cause I was hungry (starving I could barely stand) maybe it was the right chef, maybe it was the air, or maybe just maybe this little chain restaurant in Etobicoke is making one of the best Burgers in the city and no one is talking about it. 

Get in there order it and let me know what you think!!!"}
{"text":"My BFF and I were cruising around looking for a quick bite to eat before heading to the Queensway for a movie. We generally like to try new places on these excursions so the chain restaurants were definitely out.

From the outside it appears as a full service restaurant; however, you do have to stand in line to place your order. They have a limited brunch menu but it covers all the staples, to accompany it, they also have a coffee bar. For those so inclined they are also licensed.

My friend and I placed our orders and easily found a place to sit (this was a Sunday morning so that's not common). We quickly received our order, probably under 10 minutes wait.

I had a crepe and was not a fan. The fruit compote was sour and the infused whip cream was just inedible. The crepe itself was pretty tasty though.

My friend ordered French toast which she said was good. She had similar issues with the whip and what we both found unappealing was the cinnamon infused butter. Way too rich. At the end of our meal, we also realized that my friend never got her coffee but they fixed that minor quip quickly.

All in all, we probably won't be returning. But if you're looking for a unique brunch option on the Queensway this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times and every time I get something different and it's always AMAZING. I honestly love this place the food is so good and definitely not overpriced. The staff are always sweet and the interior is cute as heck. I love this place."}
{"text":"Oakvilles best little kept secret. Their everything is amazing but the cajan chicken is my go to. Just wish they had a better carb-free menu :P"}
{"text":"Oh man, I'm blown away by how friendly the staff at Stoney's are! Just came by for some breakfast and lost-looking little ol' me was shepherded through the whole process by the friendly lady behind the counter. Service is efficient and kind, coupled with one heck of a back bacon sandwich, I'll definitely be back here to try out their lunch items!"}
{"text":"Tried the slow roasted lamb sandwich and the catalunya pizza.  Both dishes were excellent.  The lamb was moist and tender.  The pizza was paper thin and loaded with toppings.  The service was also not bad, considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"From their pizzas, sandwiches to desserts - Stoney's knows how to make delicious food. We arrived for brunch with two friends on Sunday. We arrived early and was able to grab our food quickly as well as get a seat. Within Stoney's, you order your meal at the counter and pay and then take a number so that it can be delivered. Their portions are generous and everything tasted very fresh. Their prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was extremely dissatisfied with this place. I actually was taking my niece out for lunch but our original choice ended up being closed. I had heard great things about Stoney's so we came here instead. I realize it is a bread company and had I ordered a sandwich, I probably would have been very happy (the sandwiches looked great). But being gluten-free was a bit of a challenge combined with my need for vegetarian and dairy free food.
The guy at cash said I could get any of the sandwiches bread-Free as a salad. The only one suitable for me was the grilled veggies minus all the cheese. I opted for the daily soup (roasted red pepper) and the field green salad minus the cheese. My niece had the same salad with cheese.
So over priced for what we got.
My soup was a small bowl with a toast on the side (gluten). The soup was so sour that I had to use the bread to dilute the sourness....and now my tummy hurts
The salad was a big bowl of mixed greens with a few grape tomato halves and lots of croutons! I put the croutons in my soup, ate a bit of the salad and wasted the bulk of it....I was not in the mood to eat a giant bowl of greens.
My niece said her salad had too much dressing and a hunk of cheese in the centre.
You order your food, pay/tip then sit down. That tip would have been quite different had we got our food before paying.
What a let down"}
{"text":"Took a detour to Oakville on the way home from Hamilton. Asked some random family in a parking lot for a sandwich place suggestion and they all said 'Stoney's!' simultaneously.
I can see why they were so excited now. 
The restaurant itself is cozy and classy. Nice little outside patio. Service is super friendly and relaxed. No stress just warm welcome.
It was very difficult to choose just one menu item as I watched all kings of delicious played being served to other guests. I finally settled on the sandwich named after a street (I forget what it was called) and my friend had the braised lamb sandwich. We shared. And reached sandwich nirvana. Everything here looks so good. Waffles and other brunch items looked to die for. We finished our meal with a German brownie. Too good. Go here, try everything. Twice."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast; large portions, made fresh with whole ingredients. Unfortunately, the host/front cashier was rather disingenuous and rudely rushed the service - didn't feel welcome at all. Hope she gets some training on how to treat people  in a mor humane way."}
{"text":"So my brother has been raving about this place for a while, and I finally got a chance to check it out with him over the weekend. (Side note: this is a horribly misleading name for a restaurant, as I assumed they only sold bread.)

Anyway, we decided to share two items: the Calabrese pizza and the Blackened Chicken sandwich.

The latter, which comes with chicken, goat cheese, avocado, and lemon dill aioli on a Panini, is indeed a very tasty sandwich. The sauce is plentiful and delicious, although the chicken was fairly dry. Had I eaten the chicken by itself this might have been a problem, but the assortment of toppings easily hides this dryness.

The Calabrese pizza, \"chorizo sausage, roasted peppers, kalamata olives, asiago, mozzarella & fire roasted tomato sauce,\" is similarly very good. It arrived at the table hot and fresh, and the oozing cheese was irresistible. The weird, bread-like crust wasn't my favorite, admittedly, and there wasn't even remotely enough tomato sauce for my liking, and yet I enjoyed eating every bite of it.

If only they'd put just a little more care into their offerings, Stoney's Bread Company would be ranked as one of the better fast service restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"AMAZING.

Only bad thing about this place is that it closes tooooo early.  Wish it was open later so I can go for a late night bite!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and generous portions. Very, very friendly staff. We tried the special salad and the Atlantic salmon salad. Both were excellent. This place is located on a cute street and there was easy parking with lots of parking meters around. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stoney's: this place kinda sorta rocks my socks. 

Very busy even when our Yelp group got there at 10am - and it only got busier from there (I'd say that's when the rush really starts). 

The seating & service at Stoney's is a bit unique: you actually stand in line and order at the cashier, pay for your food (no tip!?), and THEN they seat you. I don't really mind this, except it kind of sucks of you want a second drink later 'cuz you'll have to line back up. 

On to the star: the FOOD!

Holy moly! The portions here are HUGE! Come hungry or bring a friend that can help you finish your plate off!

We had the French Toast that comes in 3 giant pieces. Sprinkled with brown sugar, and comes with fresh fruit and a cinnamon spice butter (yum!). Sometimes I find thicker french toasts can be a little too under-battered, but these were perfectly battered and yummy throughout! 

We also tried the 3 cheese omlette which is, again, gigantic! Unless you are starving this is definitely a two person mission, and boy, they sure don't skimp on the cheese! This thing was bursting full of delicious, ooey gooey, cheeses. Mmm.

I look forward to coming back next time I am in the Oakville area!"}
{"text":"I went to Stoney's back in March with a couple of my friends for dinner. 

It's a cute place but you have to go up to the counter, place your order and then they bring it to your table. I ordered the Giuseppe's pizza (see pic) and it was delicious. Thin crust, cooked to perfection, fresh ingredients and perfectly seasoned dough. One of my friends had a Caesar salad and tuna sandwich which was on some freshly baked bread and she said it was outstanding. My other friend had a pizza that had artichoke and some other stuff that didn't look too appetizing. She complained that it was very soggy.

The young guys that were working there were very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely return and order the Giuseppe's pizza."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the real deal! The bread is fresh, the soups are hot and the sandwiches are grilled to perfection.

The tomato based east coast clam chowder has me coming back again and again. The lamb sandwich is huge with a nice balance of flavours. 

They even offer a kickin brunch menu and a front facing patio. 

Come down and grab a pint with some freshly baked goodness!"}
{"text":"Best lamb sandwich I've ever had!! Great service and nice environment. Wish this place was in Toronto and was expanded. Took my friends from the US before I dropped them back to the airport. Perfect way to end a great weekend."}
{"text":"The service at Stoney's is only surpassed by the amazing food. I have yet to have anything other than a wonderful experience at Stoney's."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a shot after featuring on \"You Got To Eat Here\" although we live in Oakville but we never heard about. We are in late 40's experienced eaters and we can distinguish a true gem if we see it. Soup of the day, $5.00,  terrible, salty, way over salty, corn chowder but has nothing to do with corn or a chowder. Lamb Sandwich, $11.00,  was well flavored but as most Canadian establishments, lacks lamb! More meat fellows! Busy and when we expressed our soup concern to Jennifer or Kyle..young waitress...no response from anyone in the store...one time thing till we eat in the USA once again, hard to find value or food in Canada."}
{"text":"I have been going to Stoney's in oakville since almost 8 years and love their food. Was happy when saw the queensway location and have tried their food few times.  Had Florence street sandwich twice here. And both time chicken was under cooked and taste is not the same as oakville location. And their service is not good as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing food and great service. Staff is very friendly, sandwiches and pasta are always good! Worth the drive to Oakville!"}
{"text":"Really great food - very unique flavours keep you coming back - try the Calabrian chicken - again, when I did eat meats it was a Sunday must."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch fare, I'm a little disappointed they wouldn't make me an omelet at 2 PM, I was really looking forward to it.  Had their veggie sandwich that was very good and my buddy had some tuna contraption that he said was great.  Presentation of sandwiches was very impressive.  Price was fair.  Ordering is unique, you go to a counter at the back, place your order and pay.  They then give you a number, you find a table, they find you.  The pizza's looked amazing, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Stoney's has everything you need food wise, great poached egg  dish for breakfast :)."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast one day and was so happy that I did. There is a breakfast menu that is not listed on the website. I had the egg sandwich with spinach and goat cheese. Turns out, it is actually an entire omelette on bread. It was incredibly good. It was flavorful and filled with high quality ingredients that made the most amazing breakfast."}
{"text":"While I thought this place was ok, I did not love it.  Very similar to Panera Bread but slightly more expensive.  The food was tasty however, so I cannot knock it.  That being said, the girls behind the counter acted like they did not want to be there....half listening to the guests is not ok, and to act like it is so hard to bring someone drink they paid for that you as a hostess/ server forgot is NOT ok...especially when you are not busy.  The bill for a salad with grilled chicken, pasta with grilled chicken, and a small bowl of soup plus a bottle water and a lemonade was over $50.  With tip it was $60.  Could have had the same meal at Panera Bread for $35."}
{"text":"I've always driven by Stoney's without noticing it until I came across someone's IG post of their Eggs Benny. My friends and I decided to check it out on the way out of town. When we arrived there were a few people eating breakfast but noticed there were lots of seating. The restaurant style is like most nowadays. You order at the front, pay, and they bring you your food. I decided to just go with the Stoney's breakfast with back bacon since I just wanted something simple. My friends got pancakes and French toast and whoa let me tell you right now, the portions are HUGE. I can't imagine one person eating the entire meal. You could definitely share that plate. 

Overall my friends and I enjoyed our breakfast. You don't get much interaction with servers so it's hard to tip when you order. But someone did come clear our plates right away when we were done. I'll definitely be back at Stoney's to try some lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Stoneys is one of my favourite places to go to lunch! Love their pizzas and sandwiches. They offer great service. The only issue is that they're always busy and the location in Oakville is small"}
{"text":"Absolutely and wholly, paradise for the taste buds. Everything I have tried here, has been amazing. The quality is high, the presentation is artistic, and the portions are just right. On top of everything, their lattes are super yum! So far, the Blackened Chicken Sandwich has easily made it to my all-time-favourite-dishes list, although I have a while to go before I have tried everything off of the menu. 

If you are in Oakville, and you want to pamper your taste buds, this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"Finger licking yet simple comfort breakfast options such as chorizo omelette over buttered soft toast or just a simple scrambled egg sandwich with goat cheese and spinach. If you feel like a big traditional fulfilling brunch, this is the place you need to be. They do not offer table service. They are good for groups and kids, they have high chairs. Credit cards are accepted. The staff is very friendly. Opens at ten in the morning every week day."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers the food was awesome! Hubby and I split the blackened chicken sandwich and the spinach salad and were more that satisfied. The area around the restaurant is really nice as well. Definitely stop in if you are in the area....wish I came in on a Sunday for the brunch though, menu looked awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great burger with really nice fresh bun. Potato wedge side came as chunks of potato with sauce which wasn't good."}
{"text":"For the most part this place is a hit. Their pastas are good, their bread is good, their specials are generally good. I've just had one issue with a burger being a little too overcooked."}
{"text":"I've been to the Oakville location a coupla times.  Just as a comparison, Queensway has Oakville beat for the following reasons:
-  PARKING!  It is a one-way driveway, but at least there's free parking at this location
-  longer hours than Oakville.  They're actually opened here past dinner hours AND on Sundays as well
-  no awkward self-seating here.  You won't feel like a loser, on the first day of high school, after you've placed your order.  Someone actually seats you!
-  much larger dining area

Just a coupla drawbacks:
-  food did take a while to arrive to the table, re:  I was able to make a couple of business calls before anything arrived
-  just as noisy.  Not sure if it's just echoey, but the dining room wasn't full and it was still quite loud in there!

Food is just as good.  Menu appears to be the same.

BONUS:  No tips necessary here.  Order, pay, sit, then eat!"}
{"text":"3.5-4*s - Food was better tasting on previous occasions.  Service was nice, professional, but since the place is such a zoo, this is not a place for you to sit 'n linger...

CONS
-  paid parking :( with the exception of Sunday &/or evenings, I think.  Check with the parking meters
-  can be loud, especially if you come during a rush
-  HELLA BUSY, so it can be overwhelming as a first-timer.  Order, then try to find seating, not before!
-  you may be asked to move, albeit kindly, if you're 2ppl sitting at a 3-4 person table
-  as mentioned, I thought the food this time was just alright.  The fact that the place is hopin' may either make you think it's better...or not if you like to dine in peace

Margherita Pizza ($9) was covered in a blanket of mozz.  It tasted alright, but would've been better with more tomato sauce (acid) and scarce pieces of mozz - not slathered cheese that was a bit salty and too overpowering.

Curried Lamb Sandwich ($11) was alright too.  Presentation seemed weaker this time.  And meat was seasoned, but I don't think it was salted.  While I was eating it, my hands were covered in oil which I can only assume came from the pan frying the slices of lamb.  

PROS
-  BOTH portions were quite generous.  Only ate half of sandwich/pizza.  So either share, bring your appetite, or doggy bag it!
-  water + slices of lemon + ice cubes provided, serve yourself.
-  outdoor seating

I *must* mention the service.  Although I don't think it's necessary to tip, the people who clear off the table are under a lot of pressure due to the high traffic.  I've find them quite nice/friendly on all occasions, despite the hustle 'n bustle of the place!"}
{"text":"My fav spot. Our family picks are Key West Eggs and Nove sandwich. Just can't resist to go there once in awhile 
They have a delivery through SkipTheDishes and UberEATS but not all the meals are available. We're usually visiting on the weekends and it's quite busy. But we were always able to find a table."}
{"text":"Stoney's is the thing I miss most about Oakville.......yummy fresh bread, amazingly fresh food, creative items and a staff that is passionate about their jobs and the food they serve. 

Maureen P hit the nail right on the head - it's worth the drive to Oakville:) 

My mouth is watering thinking about the spinach and goats cheese salad. It's the best one I have had and I can't replicate it even at the build your own salad places! 

The atmosphere is so homey and welcoming, you could spend all day just enjoying little bits of food. It's a wonderful place for a lunch date or a place to stop in after a day of shopping with the girls."}
{"text":"I always get a different sandwich when I come to Stoney's, and I've never been disappointed. The daily specials are great but the staples are to die for. Something about the sundried tomatoes tho... amazing!"}
{"text":"Didnt know that you could actually mess up french toasts this much!
Litterally was not able to eat it , except for the fruits"}
{"text":"Very lovely spinach fritata with campazola. Nice ambiance good coffee. Great place for a weekend breakfast. Will  definitely rerun on a Sunday for full brunch. 
Pleasant and fast staff."}
{"text":"Popped in for coffee and cake mon afternoon. The place imo is ok and almost cool. Just not quite. It's sorta industrial but quite lacking in colour or character. 
Drip coffee good and slice apple crumble tastey. We sent back my friends cappuccino as the cup was only half full if that. The manager came by to a nearby table to checkin but ignored us. At least it feels the Queensway is coming up!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It has a nice Californian feel. Along with this the meals are delicious. I suggest a steak sandwhich or chicken sandwich. The salads they prepare are also excellent."}
{"text":"And on the seventh day, He said let their be BRUNCH!!!

Hands down, my favorate spot in the GTA. The pastas are good, the pizzas are great, and the sandwhiches and Sunday brunch are another reason to love life! 

The creative genious that crafted this menu is like Michaelangelo to me (not the ninja turtle, but the other guy)...an artist among artists! Each sandwhich is served on it's own unique bun/bread, with a specific cheese to bring out the medly of flavours from each fresh and favorful ingredient that tops the mouth watering meat that has been marinated to the core and then cooked to perfection!

While I don't do pork, I've tried most of the sandwhiches on the menu by now. The slow roasted lamb and blackened salmon were both stellar.  Even better were the steak sandwhich cooked the way YOU like it, and an incredible chicken sandwhich found on their daily specials menu.  

I was already convinced that this was my favorate restaurant in the GTA and then I took my parents here for a sunday brunch.  This place has a seperate sunday brunch menu that is unique to any i've ever seen before and it completely blew my mind.  One of few places that can satisfy a vegetarian and a meataterian alike.  Each plate comes with some mystery ingredients that i'd never heard of before.  Huge portions, and great food that will leave your mouth watering for weeks every time you think back to it that great sunday afternoon.  The only catch is the restaurant closes at 3pm on sundays and gets hella busy by noon.  So set your alarms, put on those loose track pants and get to it!

If you love food...then its about time you met the new love of your life!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times to get an amazing sandwich.  The lamb one is still my favourite and a just try for newbies that want to experiment and get a taste of the best!"}
{"text":"We had the margherita pizza, alsacian chicken sandwich and the clam chowder. Everything was delicious and big portions. It was a bit pricey and the cafe Americano was only so-so but it's a nice ambience and overall a good experience"}
{"text":"Have come here about 3 times when the other restaurants in the area were too busy. Admittedly I was surprised by the food and staff quality- both are excellent. The servers remembered me when I came in on my second time and everything I've ordered has been delicious. I also appreciate the general casual vibe and modern decor. Ordering at the counter and retrieving your own water is a cool concept and the seafood pasta is fantastic- I think about it often lol."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here its a religious experience. The ambiance, the lattes and the food are amazing. 

Portions are huge so come hungry. There isn't one bad thing that I've tried here. Last instance was the Key West eggs -poached eggs, hollandaise, prawns, fresh guac and pico de gallo on homemade sourdough and field greens. It was amazing. Everything on our table looked amazing too, some had omelettes, french toast, crepes and pizza. A-MA-ZING!"}
{"text":"A BIG FAN... perhaps one of the best pizza places in the whole GTA"}
{"text":"Favourite brunch / lunch spot! I've never tried anything that I didn't like here. Great service..great food great atmosphere..perfect!"}
{"text":"Stoneys is good, though I think over hyped. It's pretty trendy (and has been for eons) so come early and be prepared to wait. Food / service is excellent, though not a 5/5. It's worth the wait, definitely good stuff."}
{"text":"I used to live 2 mins walking from this place, and it was my FAVORITE restaurant. I loved everything Ive ordered, and enjoyed every encounter with the staff.  The 3/5 is due to my most recent visit this past weekend, let's just summarize it as less than ideal. The food was mediocre at best and the service was poor. I really hope it was a one off!

Parking 
There are 10+ spots upfront and on the side. You can always park in the theater parking lot. 

Décor
Plenty of seating options. Well decorated. Lighting and noise level is just right!
 
Service
Stoneys offers a little different experience from your typical dinning/sit-down places . You order once you enter, and you decide where to sit. The servers will bring you your food and drinks, and they leave you alone for the rest. 
Typically ,ordering is a quick and friendly experience. If you aren't so sure on what to get or have trouble deciding , they will help you! They have been right every time. 
Most recent visit ... There were 3 cashier's standing and chitchating behind the counter and no one showed ownership. Also we didn't have any utensils to eat with. Salad + hands is a no no!

Food 
Did i mention this was my favorite restaurant? Everything is cooked, grilled or baked to perfection. With every bite you can taste the freshness of the ingredients and the hard work of the chef.  
Most recent visit ... The food almost sucked. 
COASTAL MUSHROOM
Menu:\"portobello, crimini & field mushrooms, feta cheese, mozzarella & fire roasted tomato sauce\"
There was probably 2 types of mushrooms on my pizza at best, and pretty sure it was canned mushrooms. And definitely 0 feta. 
BLACKENED ATLANTIC SALMON SANDWICH
Menu:\"avocado, mango salsa, citrus aioli served open face on focaccia with mixed field greens\"
Avocado was missing. The salmon was 1/4 of the bread and it was half burnt.  

Verdict
I really hope my recent visit was an one off experience. I hope you get to experience the stoneys I love."}
{"text":"Came here for the Sunday brunch menu as suggested by a friend. I had some high expectations after how much praise he gave it and I must say, I was not disappointed.

The portions were both large and tasty. We tried both the Key West Eggs and the Slow Roasted Lamb sandwich.

The Key West Eggs had a great hollandaise sauce with a good mix of prawns, avocado and tomato underneath. The eggs were poached perfectly and it all came together very well with the grilled focaccia. The salad of field greens and asiago that came with it filled up the rest of the plate and had a nice balance of dressing to salad ratio. A tasty dish for sure.

Being a fan of lamb, I enjoyed Slow Roasted Lamb sandwich. However, if you can't handle any of the gamey flavour of lamb, I wouldn't recommend this for you. The lamb was tender and flavourful and went well with the rosemary marmalade and mustard.

This is a well known place and it does get pretty packed, so try to get here early (especially on a Sunday)."}
{"text":"My wife and I went her for the first time. It is one of those spots where you go up to cash and order. You then sit down with a number and they bring the food to you. I had the steak sandwich and my wife had the shrimp and scallop salad. Both were very big meals and were delicious! Only reason for the 4 stars is price. Very expensive spot. I do recommend a try."}
{"text":"Great good, quality ingredients. Staff are engaged and friendly. Price point a little high for what you're going for (sandwiches) but at least the quality makes up for it. The food will fill you, the flavours will impress."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu. Gourmet meals for a fraction of the cost. Any chance we get to eat here we make sure to go hungry! Never a disappointment. Great food.. great price.. what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu. Gourmet meals for a fraction of the cost. Any chance we get to eat here we make sure to go hungry! Never a disappointment. Great food.. great price.. what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"A friend and I dropped by Monday evening for coffee and we shared a sandwich. We shared the grilled chicken sandwich and it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I am not a big sandwich gal but omg it was delicious. I will definitely go back! The lattes were very good too. I am so happy I have a place like this in my neighbourhood. The décor is nice, clean and casual but the food is delicious. A must try!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Stoney's. I'm gong to say it. 

HYPE!!!

What is going on, people of Oakville? Why are you waiting in line for 20-40 minutes for brunch or a sandwich? 

The ordering system at Stoney's is BANANAS. You go in the front door, walk through the crowded seating area and then order at a bar. You then wait in the lobby area with a little number until someone gets you a seat. Then they find your number and give you your food order.

This system is a DISASTER! The servers look mad all the time because they are constantly telling people who walk in the front door that they can't just sit down. People are pissed because there are no seats. Why not at least put a sign at the front door to order at the bar? 

Stoney's, WHY are you working so hard to maintain this terrible system? 

Ok, rant over. 

The food is pretty delicious. The pizzas have this beautiful crispy thin crust and the sandwiches are full of fresh ingredients and are really hearty. 

Go on a weekday or Saturday (early) for lunch to avoid the line!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and worth the wait. Weekends can be very busy so get there before 9.30, otherwise expect a wait.  Good system in place in that your food won't be served until you are seated. Generally not an issue because there is a sea of people looking at you to finish your food so that they can get seated! Encourages a steady turnover of customers.
All food here that I have tried has been exceptional.  I would hands down state that this is the best breakfast place I've eaten at. Lunch and dinner is also good, but this place is known for breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here as a woman who LOVES lamb more than any other meat to try the slow roasted lamb sandwich other Yelpers have raved about. The lamb and veggies were fine but the bun was so thick, it dried out the contents. I suggest they try a thinner moister bun or bread for optimal results. As it was, I would rate this good but not perfect, 7.5 out of 10. My daughter had the spicy shrimp tacos and hubby the Stoney Burger and they both enjoyed what they had. 

I also ordered the \"Eastern\" Clam Chowder to share with my daughter, erroneously assuming it was the New England style clam chowder. But when the chowder arrived, instead of creamy white, it was a reddish orange broth, indicating that tomatoes had been added to the clam chowder. Unfortunately I hate tomatoes in my soup or sauce. So my daughter ended up eating all the soup herself. She had no complaints, I hasten to add. But I think they should change the confusing name \"Eastern.\" 

Does Stoney's know that New Englanders feel so strongly that tomatoes should never be added to clam chowder that Maine tried to make it illegal? It may be a perfectly good *Manhattan* style or something else clam chowder, but it's not New England style chowder.

You can get iced water with lemon from the cooler on the counter but it needs more ice cubes IMO. 

EXCELLENT TASTY FRIES: I would be seriously remiss if I didn't mention the french fries which my husband and daughter ordered. I didn't get to try them until the next morning (hubby's leftovers) but even cold, they were great. I am definitely ordering the french fries when I come here again!

ACCESSIBILITY: doors and seating are fine for someone like myself with invisible disabilities (arthritis in the spine AS + Total Knee Replacement) but there are problems using the washrooms. Even the disabled washroom has an extremely heavy door that requires all the strength in my stiff shoulders to open. Of the other 2 single stall women's washrooms, the one nearest to the dining room has dozens of scratches all round the door handle. There's a reason for that: it is the most God awful heavy narrow door ever designed! You will get a workout just getting into the ridiculously narrow stall. I doubt Jesus Christ himself could easily shove aside that washroom door if he was coming out on Easter Sunday after the Resurrection! The toilet seat is very low to the ground making it hard to get up--only the disabled stall is really suitable for me in seat height.

The other women's washroom doesn't have any scratches on the door so I suggest that ladies use the other one or the disabled stall. Stoney's, you need to fix the washroom door that 1000 women have scratched in frustration!

Parking: Parking lot is on the patio side facing the Queensway and on the side entrance, but it's inadequate. Fortunately you can park in the nearby Cineplex lot next to Stoney's entrance on the side street if Stoney's lot is full, as it was when we came at Friday lunchtime.

Overall a good sandwich/burger/pasta place and we will be back to try Stoney's again."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see this Queensway location of Stoney's open much closer to home.  Now we don't have to trek to Oakville for their amazing lamb sandwiches!

We had the pleasure of dining at Stoney's during their soft open when they invited customers to sample items from a selected menu free of charge!  When we entered, we were given a card with 4 random menu items and were asked to order any 2.  They explained that this was way for their chefs to be able to cook everything on the menu.

We chose the balsamic chicken sandwich, the seafood fettuccine and the manager allowed us to order the pepperoni pizza for our toddler.  Wait time for food was a bit longer than usual due to the high volumes of orders all going in at once and this was a training exercise for the kitchen staff.  Not a problem for us as the wait was definitely worth it.

The balsamic chicken sandwich was impressive in size and taste (and I'm not the biggest fan of sandwiches).  The seafood pasta was an extremely generous portion, brimming to the top with a bevy of sea creatures like shrimps and scallops.  And the pepperoni pizza was also delicious.

We're pretty sure that we would have been happy with anything on the Stoney's menu.  It's hard to be disappointed with their quality food.  We'll be back again for that lamb sandwich!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found myself in Oakville for an appointment and looking for food afterwards.  Decided to check out Stoney's based the fear of having to eat at Kelsey's and all the positive Yelp reviews.

We arrived later in the evening so the metered parking beside the restaurant is free after 6pm.

We ordered the Slow Roasted Lamb ($10.50) and Nove ($9.00) sandwiches along with Greek ($6.00) and Caesar ($4.00) side salads.   

I did try a bite of the lamb sandwich even though I'm not really partial to lamb.  I was completely caught off guard after a small taste, I honey badgered the remaining half of the lamb sandwich.  I always describe lamb as too gamey and uriney for my tastes.  But here I was savouring every bite!

The Nove sandwich was good...very thick with roasted chicken, bacon and provolone, although paled in comparison to the lamb.  Salads were good and a hearty size, definitely enough to share one between two 

Stoney's is for sandwich lovers...I mean people who really, really, REALLY love sandwiches.  I liken it to an upscale version of Panera.  Sandwich lovers will be in heaven here."}
{"text":"As Stoney's also does catering, I ordered 3 pasta dishes for a birthday party of 18 people.  One of the dishes might have been slightly overcooked but overall everyone at the party was very happy with the quality and quantity. I'd order from them again!"}
{"text":"You will come back here time and time again. All the sandwiches are amazing but make sure to  pair with the butternut squash pear soup - starts savoury and ends sweet. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Love it love it! I was waiting to try it for a long time.  All their bread is home made.  I was there for Sunday brunch. I ordered a key west. The bread is nice and great texture.  Nothing like a light wonder bread loving little heat on the shrimp.  It was the right balanced by the yummy avocado salad.  The egg is perfectly pouch ( even better than Toca at the Ritz Carlton Toronto)   I defintely recommend stoney for breakfast !!!!!"}
{"text":"This established Oakville restaurant branched into Etobicoke recently and it's a welcomed sight on Queensway.  The food quality, smiling service, and fairly large portions all translate well to a great dining experience.  It can be a bit confusing to new diners as it's almost cafeteria like in the ordering (upfront at the counter and then food is served to you at table side) but the very happy and insightful staff makes choosing a breeze from it's vast selection.

When you walk in, it's a very nice open atmosphere ... warm, simple, and spacious.  We had 2 families at our table and they were very happy to quickly put two tables together for us as we ordered at the central counter.  The staff at the main counter was very helpful to figure out which sandwich would appeal to the most particular child ... she asked the little girl what was her favourite sauce, vegetable, spices, temperature, and textures.  Her suggestions to everyone's taste was spot on!

We ordered 3 soups, 1 main salad, 3 sandwiches, 1 side salad, and 1 pizza.  At first we wondered if we had enough food but when the first soups arrived at our table ... we knew we were had more than enough!  Described as 'cup' sized... these were large cups!  It was closer to bowl sizes for most downtown Toronto eateries.  The east coast clam chowder was chock full of chopped vegetables and pieces of clams.  It had nice nuanced spicing to keep it interesting.  The squash and pear soup was nicely pureed and the kids loved it.  It was definitely on the sweet side and could have used more spicing to make it more nuanced but it's a solid soup.  The main salad and sandwiches came out moments later and they were HUGE and really nicely plated.  The maple salmon salad should be relabeled as maple bacon and salmon salad as there was as much bacon as salmon.  The large piece of salmon was nicely seared and yet still had a light coral red interior to show it wasn't over cooked.  The champagne vinaigrette was a nice compliment to the many beans, tomato, and new potatoes.  The pulled pork sandwich, grilled vegetable sandwich, and Nove chicken sandwich all required a good two hands to make sure the large filling didn't fall out.  We really appreciate how they used real chicken breast instead of deli chicken meat.  All the sandwiches were very tasty and everyone enjoyed their choice.  The 'kids pizza' was delivered piping hot to the table and it was larger than a big dinner plate!  We ended taking 3/4 of it away because it was so big.  I will admit the pizza was probably not a preference of mine as I found it very thin crust but underdone at the same time.  Perhaps too much topping (is that such a thing) for such a thin crust so it makes it 'soggy'?  Either way, pizza is not as strong offering as the sandwiches and salads.

It's clear we enjoyed the food and though it is priced higher than other local options, the food quality and service definitely makes you feel the price is very reasonable.  We honestly think the service is top notch as we had the manager come to our table (and all the other tables) to ask how things were and attentively listen to what we liked and perhaps what we would like to see offered differently.  The kids loved the service because the head chef came around a few minutes later with a complimentary chocolate chip cookie to every child that was the size of my hand!  Kudos for thoughtful service.

It is a pricier option but well worth the value as you feel like a special guest in a restaurant that offers fantastic food and service!"}
{"text":"This place is nice, casual but still nice. I was surprised that we have to line up, order food and then pay for it before we get a table, reminds me of Richtree in Toronto. The food is good, price is a tad higher but for quality it is justified. The sandwiches are substantial, seafood pot is great and salmon quinoa salad was good too. The seating area is a bit right so I can see how this place can get packed fast. What I don't love is the lack of ventilation so by the time we leave, our hair and clothes smells like I've worked in the kitchen all day. Can't really go out after eating here."}
{"text":"I like to come here on weekends when I want to enjoy a nice brunch with friends. I came here for breakfast twice so far and I enjoyed myself! I try to impress my friends by bringing them here LOL

I tried the omlette and the egg & bacon sandwich. Always includes a side salad and the food equality is high. 

Although I find it pretty pricey for 1 person to eat breakfast that I could make myself.... I like to treat myself to GOOD food once and a while. YUMM"}
{"text":"This place has amazing fresh food.  I usually do the nove sand which, and it never fails. The pulled pork is amazing too, especially with the garlic aioli  they put on it. The pastas are pretty good as well.  

The reason I'm only giving this a four star, is the staff. I usually find them to be a little... I don't want to say not friendly, but just really... Blah? I don't get a good vibe ordering from them usually, and can really put a bit of a damper on the mood, not seeing many people smiling or looking like they enjoy their job... But the chefs do kill it, gotta give it up for them and the food they produce."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe in Oakville with a large selection of sandwiches and pizza.  I had the balsamic chicken sandwich which was very tasty and my wife had the tuna salad sandwich - I've never seen a tuna sandwich piled so high Before!    

The speed of the kitchen was quite fast - we had our meals within 10 minutes of ordering.  While the food prep was quick, you could tell that the dishes were still put together with care.  

One thing they might want to work on is the numbering system for bringing food to the tables - I noticed a couple of times that the servers had some confusion about which table to bring the food to.  

If you're going to park near the restaurant, bring some change because the parking meters at the side of the building only take coins, no bills or credit cards.  Fortunately for me, the person before me left the meter with 40 minutes in it - score one for me!!!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me to the oakville location and was glad that they opened up a location near my area. I love their food. Their blackened fish sandwich is to die for! Their pastas are delicious! Food is always fresh. And the place itself is a very warm and inviting atmosphere. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Stoney's on Kerr. Love food in this place. Ambiance is not what I would call cosy but who cares.  I managed to avoid busy times - the place is normally busy at lunch. Their strength is Sandwiches indeed. I also like their lunch size salads. \"Chowda\" was pink and unimpressive to my taste used to New England style clam chowder. There are better pizza places for sure. But the Sandwiches - the one with brie, caramelized onion and apple. Mmmm... Fresh ingredients for sure. The creator of the ingredients combination in this Sandwich should be given Nobel prize.  The Sandwich is big and flavorful  - I can never finish it for lunch. For a place like this I had pretty decent cappuccino there. Great friendly service at the counter. Either I am lucky or... There is absolutely no tension. They smile, they crack jokes. I experienced great atmosphere. But again it was mostly off peak hours. I like sitting inside. In my experience it was either too hot and sunny outside or a few hungry deeply disturbed by divine smells yellow wasps were buzzing too close to my face. But that might have changed. 
Recommended for sit down lunch or sandwich take out."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in oakville other than Kerr street cafe. Great pastas, sandwiches and frittatas. Can be busy on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Consistently good every time we go for lunch. We had pizza and salad which were both delicious. The chicken on the pizza was very dry, would've been 5 star if it wasn't the dry meat they used. Otherwise excellent food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good location, parking lot outside. Near the movie theatre. 

We met up with a friend here - spacious inside, lots of seating, good place to catch up with friends. 

I ordered the French toast while they got the Egg benny. The egg benny was made up and delicious. I sort of regret getting the French toast as 1) too many slices 2) the texture was quite dry. I think it was just overwhelming with all the slices of toast that I wasn't a big fan of. 

They enjoyed their egg benny tho so I'll definitely get that or try something else next time! Service was good."}
{"text":"Update: Oh My Gosh.. I just tried my friends Roasted Lamb Sandwhich.. I'm not a big fan of lamb, unless it is cooked properly or in a way that i would eat it.. The sandwhich was HEAVEN.. Literally! I got the daily sandwich (I think it was a curry chicken breast with bacon, Lucious Caramelized onions, Fresh rosemary, basil leaves and some other secret sauce) the sandwich was Very fresh and delicious! I also got the Fungi Pizza (Mushroom Pizza) it was Fantastic, I took another sandwich to go and I have my pizza to go after a few bites, I got full. The customer service is Amazing the spanish lady there was very attentive and was very kind and she packed up everything for me beautifully. It's my first time at stoney's! I wanted to see what all the hype was about and boy.. was I pleased! Definitely coming here again and I highly recommend and I will get the fetrucini pasta next time.. since I came in for lunch they don't have Entres available until dinner. I like Stoney's!!"}
{"text":"Amazing space, clean with lots of parking (suburbs necessity). This is a cafeteria style place where you order and go sit down. The wait staff were pleasant yet not spectacular. 

We ordered three Boylan cane sugar drinks, three balsamic flat iron salads and two soups squash soups, $83 dollars without tip. Expensive for a bunch sandwiches and salads.

The flat iron steak was ok, too much sage, and the salad it came on was just as good as a McDonalds salad,aka nothing too special.

The soup was none existent as when I arrived home to unpack my meal the soups were not there. (Called and got a credit but still).

The chicken salad was three huge pieces of chicken breast uncut. Great protein size, hard to eat. Overall ok.

Now the problem is there is nothing decent like Stoney's  in this area however you would be better served at a full service restaurant. For this reason it only gets two stars."}
{"text":"I had the balsamic chicken sandwich and it was amazinggg. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Not a light lunch tho, and very messy with all the sauce. I got mine to-go and there was mainly just metered parking from what I saw."}
{"text":"I didn't realize how packed this place gets at lunch! We arrived at 11:45 on a weekday and already there was a line up for food. And about 5 minutes after we got there, the line behind us grew another 10-15 people. So make sure to get here early if you're hungry!!

The food was worth the wait though. I had the California baby field greens salad which came with a delicious sun dried tomato vinaigrette and shredded asiago cheese. My sister and I also split the grilled chicken sandwich, which was a good decision because it was a pretty large sandwich! The flavours in it were fantastic - chicken, tapenade, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, and feta. And the bread it was served on was perfect: toasted, but still light and chewy. 

I can't wait to go back to try their pizza. The Regina with caramelized onions, figs, and prosciutto already has my mouth watering!"}
{"text":"I wish I wish something like Stoney's Bread Company exist in Markham/Richmond Hill area! From now on all my sunday brunch will be rated based on what I ate at Stoney's, this is really hard to beat!

The Egg Florentine (Poached eggs, baby spinach, tomato chutney, brie on grilled focaccia with hollandaise and field green) I ordered was so so so good.. Yes it brings tears in my eyes when I am eating that. The 1 hour drive really worth my while! 

Everything tasted so fresh and the tomato chutney has this sour, sweet and interesting complex taste and so Italian.. as I am great fan of Italian food!

Though my breakfast comes to a total of $15 includes tips and taxes.. which is a lot more than my usual.. but I can feel there is no turning back... I might have to skip all my cheap $3 breakfast at HK style cafe from now on.

I really want to try everything on the Sunday Menu!!! sigh... They only open from 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM on Sunday. 

Next time if you are on the way to Niagara Falls for any reason.. (driving your oversea visitors to see the Falls, going to Outlet Mall, driving to Buffalo airport for your cheap flights) please come and try this place out and you see all these rave is about!"}
{"text":"The best sandwiches I've had in my life. Food is always consistent and the ordering and dining experience is very enjoyable. The atmosphere is lovely. Love this place and the food is wonderful, and great portions! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh, to order tastes with all the best qualities of home cooked time and trusted flavours"}
{"text":"I LOVE brunch at stoneys (except on Sundays when its busy and took me an hour to get my food) I recommend during the week when it's quiet and peaceful. 
I personally have to give out 4 stars instead of 5 because the price went up and not a lot of people is not down for a pricey breakfast :( I personally think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Good selection of brunch and lunch eats. They do not take reservations but the wait was manageable when we went on a winter Sat morning. Portions are very hearty so if you are not in the mood to stuff yourself (trust me you will!) then consider sharing. Esp their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Large family style restaurant with hardwood tables and chairs needs seat cushions.  First impressions no welcome when we entered had to ask how food ordering worked and if food was brought to table orders crepe aux fraise and my daughter ordered fritttata

Presentation was lacklustre crepes were rubbery and lumped together berries were ok but over cooked in the compote style appearance flavour was ok not sure where gran marnier was in sauce 

Frittata was overcooked dry seasonless and the artichoke was sour and didn't belong in the field mushroom combo very sparse carmelized onions were found 

Coffee was ok and lemon flavoured water was refreshing 

Overall would not return or recommend"}
{"text":"I LOVE bread.

Then again, I love all food, but bread holds a special place in my heart (and thighs probably). Stoney's is a trendy, casual little sandwich shop that for some inexplicable reason has yet to franchise all over Ontario. The interior has a modern Mediterranean influence and there's an awesome patio for those sunny summer days.

Now down to the nitty gritty- the food itself! Stoney's boasts fresh, mouthwatering bread and the best selection and variety around.

I dare you to read the following descriptions without drooling:
-Blackened Chicken- with goat cheese, avocado and lemon dill alioli on a panini 
-Grilled Vegetables- with asiago, mozzarella, field greens, balsamic vinaigrette on grilled foccacia

The sandwiches are pricey but HUGE- many times I have gone with a friend and we only order one to share. Service is fast and friendly. Of course, there's also many other tasty (I assume- I ALWAYS get a sandwich) things on the menu, including brunch, pasta, pizza, soups and salads.  

If you're looking for a fun place to go with fresh and delicious food (and who isn't?), definitely head to Stoney's."}
{"text":"OK, maybe I'm beating a dead horse here, but Stoney's remains really, really good. I finally came here for my first dinner time experience, and it was dyn-o-mite.

Now, be warned dinner is a bit different. The cafeteria style ordering method proved a little dicey with six people. You cannot 'reserve' a table without everyone in your party having ordered and procured food, so we weren't even sure that we would be able to sit together. Somehow we managed to cram our group of six around a pair of two tops, but it was definitely a hail Mary situation.

Once seated however, that Stoney's magic started to happen. We had four (count 'em, four) pizzas to share and two orders of steamed mussels, one in tomato sauce, the other in creamy dill.

The mussels were fine but I didn't really care about them and judge harshly those that wasted table space by ordering them (YES YOU TONY F). The pizzas were the real star. They made me literally (not literally) weep with joy.

We got the Coastal Mushroom (a mush and cheese orgy), Saltimbocca (chicken and prosciutto), Marisco (artichoke, mush, and pine nuts) and the Bilbao (chorizo, bacon and cambozola). The Coastal Mushroom was a huge hit; never has a pile of mushrooms been that enthralling. The saltimbocca was also enjoyable, though true to its name a little salty. My personal favourite was the Bilbao (my choice, natch) the cambozola imparted a bit of bleu cheese flavour to the pizza proceedings. Amazeballs.

It should be noted that in spite of the tough seating sitch (which genuinely sucked and could have marred our dining experience) the food outshines all. It's just that good here. Go now."}
{"text":"My favorite spot. I know it's nothing fancy, but the food is good! Food and service all is great. Cooks are amazing. Best stop on Oakville yiur money can buy."}
{"text":"Stoney's is the bomb, hella fresh ingredients and a really nice seating area.  Sometimes the bread and chicken are a little dry but still delicious.  I would drink the balsamic concentrate by the litre if I could.  No doubt the best restaurant on Kerr."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sandwich places you'll find in the GTA. Hard to describe the food as it is quite unique. Any sandwich is delicious...tried them all :)"}
{"text":"Massive, massive portions.  Food was good and well priced for the quantity.  I ordered a margherita pizza and butternut squash/pear soup (delicious!) and was not disappointed.  

The wait in line to order takes quite awhile and we were waiting for our food they had a computer glitch, with left the approximately 20 people behind us in line a bit disgruntled!  

They've got a small patio at the front.  Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Stoneys locations are mostly in the West end of the city. I wish they would open one in Markham too. 
My friend brought us here for dinner when we were visiting them in Etobicoke. 

You order at the front, they give u a number, you find a table and server will bring your food when it's ready.
Food was good; liked everything we ordered. I had a slow roasted lamb sandwich; a bit greasy but quite delish. My hubby had pizza which he liked, thin-ish crust and good flavour. 
My friend had pasta which looked very good.
I will return when I'm in the area. Look for daily specials on the chalk board."}
{"text":"Great place! I can't say enough about this cozy restaurant. The food and service are both great, and it has a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came for the sandwiches, but I left with a doggy bag of baked pasta. There were just far too many menu options for me to choose from, and looking up from left to right, sandwiches showed up last and by then I was already overwhelmed. To top it off, I asked if I could omit the meat from one of the dishes and the counter girl gave me a \"we can do ANYTHING since we make everything absolutely from scratch\" kind of look.

I opted for the Butternut Squash and Pear soup as well as the Four Cheese Penne, both winners. The soup (my absolute favourite soup flavour combination) was the perfect consistency and may have had a bit of cream in it, but not so much that it was too thick. There was also the wonderfully sweet taste of fresh pears that I loved. The penne was so rich that after eating the soup I was barely able to dent my dish. You could tell that the pasta had JUST come out of the oven and that each of the four melted cheeses on top of it was fresh and of very high quality. 

The decor was warm and inviting, with many types of people and different sized groups all enjoying a meal side by side. The staff was very friendly and professional, and didn't hesitate to offer help if you so much as glanced towards the counter."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! It does get packed at times. It's located in a great area (not sure if I can called it downtown Oakville) but must pay for parking on weekdays (not too expensive... I think $1 per hour). The food is phenomenal! Breakfast, brunch, dinner... You name it. What makes their sandwiches incredible is their homemade bread they bake daily. They provide great selection of drinks, from coffee to juice to alcoholic beverages. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places from my hometown.  The sandwiches are epic.  I can't think of a place that serves tastier sandwiches - the lamb sandwich is my personal favourite (try and get it on the focaccia) and they definitely do not skimp on the meat or servings.  Their soups are a bit of a rip off, but quite tasty.  I think their clam chowder is tomato based (Manhattan style) and their breakfasts are excessive as well.  You are going to drop about $15 minimum for lunch/brunch, but I can hardly say it's overpriced given what you get.  

It get's busy during the weekends for brunch so arrive before noon or after 2."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and cuisine in this Kerr street staple. All around great lunch and dinner fair...can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great pizzas and sandwiches...highly recommend the Atlantic salmon dish and salad."}
{"text":"one of the best sandwiches ive ever had and i ate it cold 2 hours after i ordered it as i drove home in a snow storm   ... cant wait to try it warm and fresh  and i want to try 
almost every sandwich they have"}
{"text":"We decided to go for a drive, and the reviews led us here. They were right. We divided the huuge lamb sandwich into 2, and with part of a salad, it was enough. The shared cafe latte was fine, and the staff were caring and fun, especially Annie. Great value for money. We got a table at noon with no wait. It was worth the drive to Oakville."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich place!! Great for casual eats with a coffee or a sit down place to eat great food. I like their system of ordering first before sitting however it was busy the day they went and I'm not sure if they have 2 registered open but only 1 was and taking a long time and only 3 people in line. I got the balsamic chicken and despite reading the reviews of some people saying the portion was large I didn't believe them until I got mine and they were right! But it's just the perfect amount of chicken and the bread and sauces were amazing. This place is definitely one of the best on Kerr street and will come back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Best place for a warm, healthy, and delicious sandwich. Hands down. 5 stars.
The food and ingredients are fresh. Great overall experience. 
You also gotta try the clam chowder, it is an underrated item on the menu but it is superb!!"}
{"text":"You cannot deny it, this place has it down. Amazing food at a great price, huge helping and great service. The Sunday brunch is out of this world good, but would recommend you go early to avoid the insanity.

Probably the best restaurant in Oakville, it's hard to beat this place"}
{"text":"Would recommend to anyone new to Oakville looking for a classic, delicious lunch or dinner. Brunch on Sunday mornings is a must if you have the patience to wait a while! Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"We went Sunday morning at 9:30 am. Got a table quickly. Tried eggs florentine and Santa Fe chicken sandwich, carrot cake and butter tart. Everything was great! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm in the middle of a life-long love affair with carbs. Buns, breads, crusts, pastas, you name it, I will travel far and wide for them... like today, when I went to Etobicoke for a gluten-filled lunch. 

I've heard nothing but excellent things about Stoney's Bread Company, alas, it took me forever to actually get here. When I pass by this joint, I'm often on my way to either the airport (no time for nonsense) or Ikea (where I shamefully like to get down with their meatballs). Finally, today I came to Etobicoke just for Stoney's. I had their chicken fettuccine, which was delicious. A giant portion complete with lots of extra veggies like fresh 'shrooms and topped with garlic bread. At $18 it was one of their priciest items, but it was well worth it. 

In closing, I say: Unless you are desperately unable to eat gluten, put carbs back in your life. These fad diets aren't good for you, and I don't care how flat your stomach is... you're cranky. Wheat is delicious. Hit up Stoney's."}
{"text":"Santa fe eggs- poached eggs were awesome
Goat cheese salad- cheese creamy without being too rich
Friendly service"}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in Oakville!! Location is great, though super busy and often too hot."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love everything about it. We come here often, for brunch on Sunday's, lunch, and even dinner too. Spectacular food. Please be around forever."}
{"text":"I tried Stoney's for the first time, and while it was alright, I wasn't impressed. What really turned me off right off the bat was the service - the people running the counter the day I was there were not friendly. They seemed like I was bothering them by ordering. I ordered a pizza and sat outside, and the pizza was alright, just alright. I've had way better. I may try it again sometime in the future, as I live down the street, but I'll definitely be giving my business to friendlier small businesses for now."}
{"text":"Consistently good since the first day it opened its doors. Lots of variety for everyone and staff is always friendly and accommodating. Stoney's is a testament to  what restaurants should be. Good food, done right at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I rarely write bad reviews.... but this place was horrible a nightmare.Had the special steak entree.... Really horrible. Steak was cooked well... But covered or should I say breaded in steak seasoning... Making it tasteless and give me an upset stomach. Additionally, the menu says its a Ny sirloin strip.... More like sirlion strip.... But about 6-8 ounce. The side garden said was good. No complaints, the mushroom and onions on top was good. And the toast with cheese under the steak was just..... Too much... and u can barely find it covered in so much onion and mushrooms and on top of these and garlic bread... The bread was so oily after.... Hard to eat. 

The service is ok. The ordering is like a takeout and sit in to eat. The atmosphere is nice.


Sadly... This place is not worth the travel. T.T not worth the hype people have been saying."}
