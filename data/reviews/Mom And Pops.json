{"text":"Amazing food, great prices, and best of all - the amazing staff! Amazing hosts - be sure to check this out when you're in the area! (Get to the area!)"}
{"text":"Had the club sandwich and it was awesome. The owners are super nice and made sure we had a good visit. Will go there again! Highly recommend if you're looking for simple yet tasty!"}
{"text":"Berkeley Bistro is such a friendly place. The staff is incredible at remembering names and they are great at being cheery even in the middle of a lunchtime rush. 

They have nice sandwiches. The bacon, cheese and egg sandwich is ridiculously affordable. 

The lighting looks dim from the street so sometimes it Bistro looks closed when its opened. Don't be fooled, walk on in and say hello."}
{"text":"Best handmade sandwiches by the friendliest staff. Hot meals and soup of the day are always a good deal.

UPDATE - I had originally rated this place five stars but nevermind. Change of owner and the guy running cash is super creepy. The woman making the sandwiches is extremely slow and should consider day job option."}
{"text":"This cute little bistro on the Esplanade (Up and coming neighbourhood) is a piece of the foundation and one of the last few family bistros! The food is affordable, all homemade and the atmosphere is something that Toronto needs more of. The owners are a very sweet couple who, when you walk in there you can just sense the love. 

This is a great place to stop by for Breakfast, Lunch or a late afternoon snack, it is affordable and a healthy alternative to all those shotty fastfood places. 

I give this place a 5/5 because small businesses like these need more support and recognition then those large franchises that are just cookie cutter restraunts. 

I recommend it and give my thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast before our tour in the distillery district. What a great find! It's the kind of place where everyone seems to know everyone. Staff were very nice and prices were very reasonable. Everything is made to order. Ask for a ceramic cup for your coffee (if not offered) if you're staying to eat. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is cozy, they serve delicious food and this place feels like home. 

@seaon R put it perfectly - you walk in and you sense the love. That love goes into the cooking, the service and the atmosphere. With reasonably priced food and drink, that is made to order, you end up chatting with the beautiful family that runs this cafe. They know their customer's names for goodness sakes!

You could be having the worst day, or it could be the worst weather, and you will instantly feel better by entering their space. I am thankful that this restaurant is in Toronto. I am thankful for this family and the delicious recipes they make.

And if you eat chicken - MY GOD TRY THE JERK CHICKEN (on Wednesdays). It is outstanding."}
{"text":"Great find! 

Owners are super friendly, food was delicious and didn't break our bank!  The atmosphere is warm, welcoming and this is a family friendly restaurant that we will be visiting again soon for the weeknight specials!

Thanks Mom and Pops, great experience and exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"Jerked chicken and rice is really good here!! They also serve sandwiches and patties. You can asked for a stuffed patty. Prices are very reasonable - leaning towards the lower end. 
The seating situation is like cafeteria style - seat yourself. The decor is nothing to rave about, however the owners really put their love and care into the food and you can taste that. Great people run this place. I'd say the down side is that if there's a line, it becomes a long wait. The service speed is below average. Aside from that, it's pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch again today; a regular occurrence these days it seems.  Every time I walk in the doors of this small and unsuspecting bistro in the Berkeley Castle, I walk out satisfied.

They have a variety of staple lunch options, ranging from delicious sandwiches made on the spot to great soups and salads seemingly made fresh every day.  To add to the deliciousness this place already brings, the prices are rock bottom and perfect for anyone looking for a healthy and delicious lunch in the St. Lawrence/Distillery neighborhood.  

Packed daily around lunch time with students from nearby Market Lane and employees of the businesses in the area, your best bet is visit this place just after 1pm when the crowds die down a bit.

The staff are very friendly, and remember all the regulars by name, usually remembering their orders as well.  Every neighborhood needs a place like this!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local soup & sandwich shop.  The staff are friendly, and try to remember everyone's name (or at least their favourite items).  Great sandwiches and home-made soups, plus a great drink selection.  Lots of seating both inside and out.  It can get really busy around the lunch rush though."}
