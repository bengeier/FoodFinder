{"text":"Stopped in for lunch here the other day, and was pleasantly surprised at the food quality and service. Menu had a nice selection of comfort foods for good prices. 

Ordered the Chicken Paprikash which was very tasty (though I'd prefer a bit more paprika in it, but then again, are any two Chicken Paprikashes alike?). Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. The location being formerly an Italian restaurant that has since moved, the lighting and such did feel a little dark for family fare. Still, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Second time here, came in for a late breakfast. Pretty big food menu, mostly comfort food and the prices are low. The owner came out and was very friendly. I'm happy to see a nice local business and we will definitely be back. They also have art on the wall for sale (I guess, there is prices on them) which is nice, but it seems they haven't changed anything since the last restaurant was in there (Sorrento's) just needs an update and would look much cleaner."}
{"text":"I've been here once for dinner and a few times for breakfast. Spaghetti sauce wasn't gourmet but home made and a decent sauce
Breakfast is good, no special must haves, just home made basic food. This is a young local man making a go of it, he cooks, not thaws out frozen pre made garbage and prices are very reasonable, try it, you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Can I just say that I was impressed before I even received my food! 

I will spare you all the details but let's just say I'm in from outta town with a few relatives and we woke up STARVING! Instead of running to pick food up or go to the grocery store I decided to get delivery. Long story short Frankie & MJ's came to the rescue. As soon as I called I heard a very helpful and friendly voice... I'm assuming I was speaking with the owner MJ. I kinda ordered al a carte and she suggested meals that would work best to feed a family of 4 which was awesome of her, totaled it out and allowed me to pay over the phone. Not even 15 minutes later the doorbell rang and our food was there! The breakfast was delicious and was enough for everyone! I really respect anyone working in customer service that goes above and beyond to make the customers experience a great one! Anytime I'm in town I will make it a point to stop by to dine in.

{"text":"I hate to post a bad review for a local business but I was very unhappy with the service and food quality when my wife and I stopped in to the new restaurant next to Stubbys and Don Tequila. 
Servers weren't well trained and talked casually with each other. We were the only ones in the restaurant. Decor is lacking. 
On the plus side, the prices are very low and the portions are generous. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was poor. Bland and unseasoned is how I would describe it. I had the feeling that most of the ingredients came out of a can. 
As a greasy spoon diner, this place might have a chance. It didn't make the cut for me. Good luck to them. I hope they're successful and able to build up their quality."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked out of the way but right off of Abbe Rd. and across the street from LCCC.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised.  He got  a cheeseburger and I got a patty melt.  The homemade potato chips are really tasty.  The prices were more than reasonable.  We're going back soon to try breakfast."}
