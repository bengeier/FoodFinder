{"text":"This is my favorite greasy spoon in the whole city. Everyone I've shown this little spot to has gone out of their way to have it again. The poutine is the best in the city, which is a big claim, but I'm a big fat guy, so trust me on this, I've tried a lot of poutines and this ones the best. Their hot dogs are great, their burgers are good, and if you're not in the mood for a poutine, just get a fry, they'll give you way too much, you'll eat the whole thing, and then feel like shit... But it's worth it! It's so good! My only gripe is a tiny one, in the last year or two, if you eat in, they serve the poutine on a plate, whereas they used to just give it to you in a small styrofoam container no matter how you ordered. Bring back the tube of poutine!"}
{"text":"This is the spot! Poutine central! My daughter loves this place. The staff is really nice and always very attentive to your requests. Solid hotdogs, burgers and poutines. This place has been around for ever, there's a reason for that. I personally feel this place destroys any of the big chains restaurants. All the food is made on order, fresh. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Holy Camoly Bing Bang! This is a 65 year old Diner.  After all this time they definitely know how to make a gyro wrapped in a Greek style pita which is lightly toasted, never had anything like it. Delicious. Their poutine sauce is simply amazingly salty and hot on some crispy fries...the opposite of the soggy ones at places like La Belle Province. Nice huge window walls overlooking a used cars garage lot and French radio playing, typical middle of nowhere feeling. Your choice of booth seating, everywhere. Type of place to film a Tarantino movie or a fashion shoot. I love cheap thrills!"}
{"text":"Well...there it is. An amazing, classic, no fuss no Banquise-type mess on your poutine. $5 for this delicious meal. Went there with a local who's lived here for 28 years and was not disappointed. Definitely recommend if you're in the area. Seriously... you can even get a Pogo+onion rings for $3!!!   Cash only. Whatever. Worth it."}
{"text":"Great local casse-croute. There are a dozen classic options for very affordable prices. They open early and close late, so you will find options ranging from breakfast to dinner. The best part is you can order anything whenever!   This rating does not reflect the quality of the food. You cannot expect too much from places like this. This rating is based on the mom and pops type service, and classic-ness of the menu (i.e. steamers, hamburger steak, poutine, full English breakfast, pancakes, etc.).  I may be a bit biased towards this place as it is somewhat of a local default, but I do leave this place satisfied everytime."}
