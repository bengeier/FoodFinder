{"text":"If you want good ramen, Sansotei is not too far away, I'm very disappointed at Kinton, they used to be good but the quality just keep going down hill, visited this store last week and it's the last time..."}
{"text":"I just got back from Japan, and I can say confidently they have nothing to worry about from kinton.   

I got the miso ramen and the broth was overly thick without the redeeming richness which one would expect from such a broth. 

The price was probably 2-3$ too much for what you got (10.99 base price for any ramen)."}
{"text":"OK food but definitely not worth the bad service and long wait! Also, after one glass of wine I was told they were all out... 6:30p on a Thursday (really?)!"}
{"text":"I could eat her more than my wallet says I can. It's not just Ramen here, I normally splurge on a number of hot and cold tapas while my girlfriend gets the ramen. 

Hot Karage, Green Salad and Ton Ton Don are some favourites. 

If you're dining in the Panache (Sapporo and fresh lemon juice) is always worth while. The food is tasty, fresh and clean - bonus points for letting me watch the kitchen! 

Most of the seating is at communal tables :(
Spicy garlic ramen is the key to any cold or congestion :)"}
{"text":"I am their number 1 customer! I have over 80 stamps on my cards (and many more un-stamped visits for a variety of reasons)

I've got their towel and t-shirt! I always order the chicken, spicy jalapeno, thick noodles, seasoned egg. I just had it today in fact! 

Happiest food ever. Keep on rockin'!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen franchises in Toronto.  The place is the smallest out of the 3 locations but food is still very good and consistent compared to the other locations.

I ordered the new kinton bun, and while it is pretty good, the pork belly bun at Momofuku is better.

The chicken ramen however is still one of the best ramen's I've had in the city.

They were also handing out free gyoza coupons outside the restaurant as a promotion so it was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Second time here for lunch and I am impressed. Been alone and in a group. With the bar style seating, either works. Food is great - especially if you're in the mood for soup / noodles!"}
{"text":"It's tasty but there's nothing there. And it's way too expensive. I ordered the chicken and I got about an ounce. I also ordered extra vegetables and got some bean sprouts and cabbage almost no broccoli. My friend had the pork and he had two pieces one of which was 1/2 fat. His was $13 and mine was $18. Not worth the money for me."}
{"text":"I got the chicken and found it a bit too salty. The place is cool but I found it a little pricy for what I got. Maybe the pork one would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Love Kinton... Out of all the Ramen joints Kinton takes the top spot in my books. Get the Tako wasabi is you like trying new thing- it's def overly different....you put the spiced octopus in the seaweed leaf and roll it and eat it. The original pork ramen is the best and maybe add some corn. This place is the go to on a cold winter day or a rainy/foggy day."}
{"text":"My first time trying this location and Kinton in general. First off, seating is not very comfy, with bar stools all around the restaurant. It makes for great space for restaurant, but not really comfy at all for customers. I got the 'spicy garlic ramen' with pork belly. The flavour is definitely garlicky, and the broth was the rich one I picked. The pork belly is not bad, I wish it was more tender but not as fatty as it is. I find that the best pork belly I've had at a ramen place is V2 Izakaya!!! My gf got their regular miso ramen...Again not that bad, not overly salty. Noodles are cooked fine. Their gyoza and takoyaki balls are fine. My gf did say that their egg is the best she's had...Then again, she is an egg lover so I'm not sure that's 100% valid. Price is a bit high for ramen and the combo in general that they offer. They do have a simple nice beer mixed drink available though. They also do their nice greeting and farewell thing if you like that as well."}
{"text":"Really tasty broth, definitely recommend the pork ramen with the sea salt flavouring and pork belly. The place has a cool vibe but I took off a star for the uncomfortable be and wobbly wooden bench seating in the back of the restaurant. If you don't want to listen to your neighbour slurp his way through the meal, ask for seating in the front, which looked somewhat more spacious."}
{"text":"Not really loving this location. The small cramped seating was too claustrophobic. You will become rather intimate with your neighbours. There will be full on shoulder to shoulder contact and not just the occasional brushing of elbows. The food has gone downhill in my opinion. The broth doesn't seem to be as full and rich as before and the pork belly slice is thinner and tougher."}
{"text":"I visit often since my office is just 1 minute away from this location. I \"feel\" the food quality has gone down the past few months. The soup has gotten more plain salty, and the slice of pork is on the dry and tough side. I used to order a bit more than just a bowl of ramen, but now I just order the bare minimum to satisfy my ramen craving. What a pity."}
{"text":"Had the veggie ramen. It had corn, wakame seaweed, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts, cabbage and topped with two tofu nuggets infused with carrots and edamame. The soup base was gingery, but a tad bit too gingery that it burned the back of my throat. The ramen noodles were thick egg noodles as the waitress kindly reminded us (vegan noodles are also avail with an extra cost). We also ordered a Kinton ball, which is a boiled egg wrapped in delicious char sui (BBQ pork) and topped with a chilli mayo sauce. 

I actually couldn't finish my bowl of ramen, especially after sharing a Kinton ball (which was awesomeness by the way).  I did like the creativeness of the tofu nuggets, and I'd suggest placing them on the side dish to nibble on as it becomes soggy quickly sitting in the soup. Otherwise, I found that there was way too much volume of, well, everything but of nothing really special. The soup base was not what I expected and too gingery spicy, the noodles seemed like a chore to eat. While I love veggies, somehow the whole dish just didn't make my top list for veggie ramen, so I'll stick to the pork or chicken ramen next time!

Service was quick and courteous, nice environment. You can take away leftovers but note that you pay an extra $0.50 for the container which has a sticker that reminds you to best eat it in 30 mins. (Just remember to separate the noodles from the soup when you get home so the noodles don't soak up all the soup!) 

I may return again if I'm in the area, but I'm still on the search for a decent veggie ramen in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Their food is good, however, I have had their ramen on several different occasions... I always get sick and I've had several of their ramen options.. I'm talking full fledged food poisoning sick. Now, I know what you're thinking... why eat there if you always get sick? I never realized until last time how violently ill their food was making me when I ONLY had ramen that day; I feel like the food isn't being stored safely or at regulation standards. Very sad because it tastes lovely however I kind of can't justify being out here shitting my stomach lining out for a bowl of soup. The seating situation also sucks and it's pretty expensive for ramen at everything down to a seasoned egg being an add-on. Hard pass."}
{"text":"When it comes to Ramen, I would say I'm pretty new on the scene (save for Manpuku in the Grange mall which I think is Ramen/ Ramen-esque even though they don't say it). But Kinton Ramen is one of my favourites! I find it reassuring that they have a few locations, even though I nearly always find myself at the Queen street location. The quality of the food is excellent- the spicer the better. My favourite is the 'Spicy Garlic' broth with pork shoulder. The service is also great. Don't hate on them because they want to get you in-and-out really quick: on many occasions, I've seen people turned away at the door because they were so busy."}
{"text":"Okay - this place is fun!  It's a bit confusing when you walk in, as someone will seat you at a shared long table, but they don't give you a menu.  If you are paying attention, you will realize that the menus are in the middle of the very long table and you need to get up and grab one or ask someone to pass it down.   You choose your broth, protein and a few other items and your soup is served up as requested.   My chicken soup came with a boiled egg in it which wasn't my favourite so I gave it to my friend.  Otherwise the soup was fantastic and perfect for a cold winter day."}
{"text":"So... I heard good things from locals about this place. I travel all over the continent for work and have tasted some near authentic ramen in some unlikely places, but this was just okay.. 

I mean the thick noodles were not even cooked all the way. The broth needed more seasoning, my coworkers and I asked for more Kim chi and toppings. However, I will say the apps were delicious. The gyoza and octopus fritter type meatballs were piping hot and fresh!

Service was decent! The waitress was confused when we asked for more toppings but I mean I had to! Definitely wasn't flavorful or spicy when I ordered it that way. 

The disappointing broth and ramen quality just did me in... So average. So a 2.5 is what I have to give."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen places in Toronto in terms of flavour profile, they would actually get a four star based on food. 

The seating is uncomfortablee, staff was not helpful/friendly. With most asian places, we just presume that tea is complimentary, they charge $2 (and doesn't give you the heads up). 

No place to put your bag/purse. Also not ideal for groups or family."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about Kinton. I brought a friend here to try Ramen for the first time. Upon the first taste of my Miso Ramen I immediately regretted not going to Santouka. The broth had one note (Miso) and the pork was dry and overcooked.

The ambience was nice and so were the staff unfortunately the Ramen fell flat."}
{"text":"We were there 11:45 Sat Jan 16 and they didn't seat us and let us in. As simple as it gets."}
{"text":"I sat myself down - I think you're supposed to wait to be seated. Gauche. 

Service was hella fast and since I popped in because it was hella cold, I really appreciated that. I love soup. All kinds, all the time. However, I would say they do a real good job here. I thought the broth was a touch saltier than I prefer but I almost never salt any dish after it comes to me, I guess my threshold is lower. Everything tasted very fresh and my fellow patrons (I was alone and a lookiloo) seemed to be delighted by their choices. I would for sure be back."}
{"text":"Food was good and traditional. Didnt get a warm greeting as we would always. But all in all kept up with expectation."}
{"text":"This is their 3rd location now in Toronto and happens to be closest to me. I had the shoyu pork shoulder with thick ramen. I had the rich soup base already but I still find the soup base was not really flavourful at all. The pork shoulder was just ok, there were parts of the meat that was very tough and hard to chew. The noodles was good as well as the soft boiled egg, the yolk was liquidity. There was a lot of bean spouts in the bowl.  But overall, I didn't like it, I had it better ramen elsewhere. If I were to come back next time, will try the spicy garlic instead, the table next to me had it and it smelled good.

The takoyaki on the other hand was pretty good, big chunks of octopus with mixture deep fried. Pretty close to the ones I had in Osaka."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the ramen is super flavorful! I like the pork shoulder with miso broth the best. 

However, if you're looking for a nice atmosphere to catch up with friends, this is probably not the best place. The bar seating is so tight which makes it hard to talk and eat comfortably if it's busy."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen 3 was pleasantly good, from its Edamame and Age Gyoza apps,  than the Ramen noodle bowls.  I ordered the original pork ramen w/sea salt bean sprouts, scallions, and nori seasoned egg...It was flavorful & enjoyable."}
{"text":"There I was - shoeless, shirtless, without any money, hair all a-frazzled, a rumblin' belly, slightly, cold, disoriented and weak at the knees. I had just woken up from a long slumber, and I had no idea that my day would involve an impromptu trip to a delicious ramen house. 

It was my first time at Kinton Ramen on Queen, and let me tell you, I will for sure be going back for a taste of the good stuff. It was a brisk fall day - I know this review is a little late. I had been working pretty hard that morning on some things, and a break for lunch was welcomed with open arms, or should I say, an open mouth, haha. 

A group of us at work ended up all wanting Kinton, well, admittedly except for me because I didn't really know of the place. But I was titillated by the idea of a new, soupy experience, and when the words 'fried chicken' left the lips of my colleague and hit my ears, all was lost, and I needed to dive into the broth. 

So we left for Kinton, at the crack of noon. It was a pretty chilly walk there because of the harsh, fall wind. But it was a sunny day, so that was fun. 

When we got there, the wait was very, very long. Too long to wait. So we made the crazy decision to go somewhere else. Okay, I'll admit I was just along for the ride, but I was a little sad to not get that fried chicken ramen I had heard some much about.

We left, but then on the walk there things sort of fell apart. One person had to run back to work, so me and another waited, while the others went some other direction to another ramen house, promising to save us seats. 

Well, those seats would remain empty, because me and the other waiting wanda decided to pull a fast one over the crew, and high-tail it back to Kinton. We figured, with less of us, we could secure a seat and obtain this so highly sought after fried chicken ramen.

And we did.

And it was so, so good.

Every bite was a juicy, mouth-watering, perfect balance of broth and beautiful chicken. I couldn't believe the flavours set before me, and the excellent quantity. It was all for me, all of it. And I ate all of it. Well, almost all of it. I get full pretty easily.

We left, and went back to work, hiding from our poor colleagues that we had indulged in a ramen experience that won't soon be forgotten. We had 'sandwiches', we said. 'Sandwiches for the history books.'

Thanks Kinton, I love you.

Your pal,

Mitch"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: the following will not give you any insight into what the food is like here at Kinton, as my experience was so bad that I left before my food arrived. 

As a Vancouverite I have high standards for ramen. Kinton came recommended to me by a few people I trust, so after a day spent working I decided to check it out....

*Coming back to this review to finish it 5 months later. Long story short: service was brutal, music was too loud and obnoxious for 5pm, and I cancelled my order out of frustration. 

Came back a few weeks later with a friend to give it another shot. Service was about as bad, music was still intolerable, and and ramen was mediocre at best. 

These guys can suck it."}
{"text":"This overall yelp rating is total BS. I come to Kinton quite regularly with plenty of friends and we generally have a 4.5 star experience. The ramen is great, is served quickly, and they have impressive drink specials ($9.99 pitchers of Sapporo). The gyozas are very tasty so you should always order those.

Spicy garlic pork with shoulder. Just order that and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen bowls! Be aware however that seating is very crowded, the restaurant has a long and narrow setup. If you have giant backpacks or are loaded down with stuff, getting yourself seated comfortably will be a challenge. Remember to get your card stamped! 10 bowls of ramen nets you a free 10-piece platter of gyoza dumplings. They have a monthly special too, be sure to at least try that if you're only going to come here once in a blue moon"}
{"text":"Came here to escape the cold and enjoy a bowl of ramen. Got seated at the bar and ordered their pork shoyu, pork miso, Sapporo beer (HUGE, only $9.9) and karaage (fried chicken) to share! 

Ramen was so-so this time-broth was great but the pork ruined it as it was too chewy. Also, the chicken karaage was very dry and not juicy/tender at all. However, my friend and I loved the beer and the big mug it came with-it was the highlight of our night. 

Service was quick-maybe a bit too quick as they were eager to seat as many people as possible. We were asked repeatedly if we had finished, and sensing that we would be bothered continuously if we didn't pay, we immediately got the bill and left. Not an ideal place to have a relaxed chat as the place is quite crowded in the evenings."}
{"text":"Walked into this restaurant for lunch while strolling along Queen street and was very happy with the overall experience! There is a fair amount of seating so no wait was necessary. The dine in service was very friendly and attentive. They are also efficient at serving takeout customers. 

The menu clearly lays out the possible combinations available. I had the spicy garlic with pork and thin noodles. It was very flavourful and the portion was filling! I would have liked to substitute the pork for chicken, but that wasn't allowed so that's where they lost a star."}
{"text":"I came after dancing across the street.   I had the jalapeño chicken ramen with sweet corn which was delicious. 

Service fast.  Lively vibe with assorted music selection. 

Small and intimate."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 7/10
Food: 7/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 8/10

The Queen location is a long strip of a restaurant, so if you're coming with a group larger than 4, you might find it inconvenient to eat here. They might even sit you at the high bar, forcing you to lean over your food anytime you want to have a conversation with someone that is not right beside you!

The service is good, and the food is fine. I tend to lean more toward Santouka for my ramen fix, but it really is all just personal taste!

THE BOTTOM LINE: it's fine, but I usually go somewhere else if I'm looking for some ramen."}
{"text":"Seating is always a challenge at ramen places, especially in a group of 4. The vegetarian ramen was surprisingly good! The Tofu nuggets looked like chicken nuggets and really really yummy. I've been here before and ordered the Spicy Garlic Ramen, Rich Broth, Thick Noodles with Pork Shoulder and it's always divine. I can't bring myself to drink the broth and be a \"kinton bowler\" and have my ugly face plastered across the internet \"huurrrr durrrr look at me, I finished errrrthing\"."}
{"text":"Just ok for Ramen. I had the original, friends had the miso and shoyu. Shoyu was the best overall but in general the quality was inconsistent. We also shared the takoyaki as an appetizer, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"This Toronto staple doesn't need anymore good reviews.
But I'm gonna do one anyways. Wah. 
I ordered the Kaarage, Takoyaki, and the cold Kale Noodles salad. 
Heavenly.
Also got their matcha cheesecake. Which was kinda itty-bitty. But bold in taste. 
Super duper."}
{"text":"The Chicken ramen wasn't convincing. What appeared to tasted like sliced turkey breast was served in chicken broth. I asked for spice and they gave me sliced jalapeños, which wasn't very effective. Where's the chili oil? I felt like I was eating chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"We came here for supper last Friday, and it was my first visit to a Kinton Ramen location. I wanted to fall in love, but my experience fell flat - I think their claim on the website to be the \"best ramen in Toronto\" is an overstatement. 

THE GOOD:
- Their menu is straightforward and makes ordering easy for those not familiar with ramen. KR keeps it simple with one standard size, and lets you customize all parts of the dish to your liking (i.e., broth, flavour, soup, meat, and additional toppings). I opted for the Original Pork belly ramen with thick noodles, pork belly, and my spur-of-the-moment fatty decision: butter. They actually added a small stick of butter in my dish, and it was wonderful.
- KR has lots of options for additional toppings: seaweed, garlic, scallions, and swiss cheese to name a few. These range from $1-3.50 extra. 
- Overall, KR is good value for your dollar. My Original Pork ramen with butter came to $11.90 before tax, and the portions are more than generous. Seriously, it takes one beast of an appetite to finish this thing. 

THE BAD:
- The seating inside isn't the comfiest - it's all high stools and communal tables. We were left to perch on the edge of a table with a noisy party of 4 next of us. I know that's just the nature of communal tables, but it doesn't make for the best dining experience. 
- For me, the food here walks a fine line between mediocre and decent. It's good, but it's just not great. There was nothing particularly wrong with it, but I was just...underwhelmed. 

Overall, Kinton Ramen is a solid 3/5 in my books - I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Try Santosei on Yonge St. or Nakayoshi Izakaya on the Danforth for a better ramen experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced ramen that is hyped. The portions are tiny. You get 3 pieces of popcorn chicken for appetizers. The ramen comes in a large shallow bowl with 2 strips of pork inside. The drinks are miniature (gone in 2 sips).

The service is very slow. They are always short staffed when I come here. There's usually one server/cashier and one person working in the kitchen.

I don't know if I'll come back again. There's many other better ramen places!"}
{"text":"Kinton is the most mainstream ramen chain in Toronto, and being everywhere I had to give it at least a try.  Being seasoned in many types of ramen in Toronto and elsewhere, I wanted to see what selling point this place had.  

The décor is nice enough, with a steel piggy greeting you at the door.  I had to wait a few minutes in line to get in, also totally acceptable.  I got the basic miso ramen with the char siu and the usual toppings. 

The most important area, the broth falls flat unfortunately.  Where other places like Santouka have a complex and bold broth, Kinton's manages to be both bland and oily at the same time.  The char siu portions were very big though, which is a bonus if you're a big eater.  The meat was tender enough, though it has none of the marbling that the competition has, tasting of only a big cut of lean pork with fat on the side.

It's not all bad though, the service is decent as is the décor, and you could definitely do worse (see Kenzo).  This place however, would not make my ramen rotation."}
{"text":"Spicy garlic was amazing. Great meat without a lot of fat. And the broth was full of flavor."}
{"text":"Um they don't have separate tables, high bar tables only. You can here everything other people talk about on the same table. This made me pretty uncomfortable so I'll probably never come back. Food is ok tho."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this little ramen spot! Spicy garlic pork ramen was amazing, pork was flavorful and broth was rich and delicious. Definitely recommend adding corn and getting the gyoza app,  perfectly crispy and the sauce is delicious. 

Came at 6:30 on a Saturday and still had to wait, but only 15-20 minutes tops, the line moves quick. Only qualm was the seating is super tight and there's no place to hang your bag at the high top. But overall definitely a good experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Kinton Ramen today for lunch with two other people. Luckily I was able to get a seat for the three of us, it's very, very busy at lunchtime so be prepared to wait! The service is fast and friendly. The ramen was delicious and fresh. I had the Chicken, thick noodles and spicy. The others had the pork and spicy broth, we all enjoyed our meals. I haven't been to any other location but be warned the seating is either at a long counter or at a long table and it's very tight quarters, so it can feel awkward and feel squished together. Luckily we were at the end of the table. I would definitely return and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! :( We are Kinton Bowlers and wanted to order takeout, BUT, apparently you can't call in to place an order. We wanted to order takeout, but were given the run around. We were told that we could only pay by gift card and then were told that the kitchen wouldn't take our order. Don't offer something you can't do!"}
{"text":"Kinton 3 is the newest location for this Ramen restaurant. It is the exact same menu as the original Baldwin spot. This place does take out on certain menu items. Don't think that was an option at the other ones. No line up which is great.

Soups are great as usual. I found the spicy ramen spicier than the other locations... So much better. Still gives to much garlic though. I suggest removing at least half unless you want to smell like garlic for 2 days after."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is my go-to ramen spot in the hood. Sometimes I get the craving and maybe it's the scent of the salty broth that brings me to their rusty pig in their front yard. When I was at the Cameron House, which is almost next door, I suddently got the urge and within seconds I had a bright yellow bowl of shrimp dotted elixir staring at me. It's amazing how that works!
Service here simply blows A&W and McD's out of the Queen Street water for a fast food snack. Sit down, shut up, and slurp your ramen!
I've only recently started checking out the different ramen spots around, and this Kinton rates as second best after Isshin Ramen on College St. with Kenzo Ramen third place.
Be aware that this one is in a high traffic heavily traveled tourist area so at peak times it may be difficult to find seating. This joint is almost always full of people from all over the world."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen you can get in downtown Toronto: you can always choose your ramen, soup, and topping! Can never get tired of their ramen ;)"}
{"text":"The spicy garlic pork ramen is consistently amazing and is a 5-star dish. Everyone is super excited to see you and I've never had bad service. As a result, I'm a regular customer.

I think their appetisers are generally disappointing, which drags the overall rating down to 4 stars, but with a big bowl of delicious ramen, who has room for appetisers? I also find that if I add a beer to my order that it's an uncomfortable volume of liquid, so be forewarned and only order the small draught beer (250 ml)."}
{"text":"- having opened about 2 weeks ago, kinton ramen will be a staple in the neighbourhood where spillover from banh mi boys will help them out, and vice versa.
- if you've been to any of the other kinton locations, it's basically the same setup (it even looks really similar)
- good bowl of ramen. not my fav in the city, but very solid joint."}
{"text":"I think its more of personal opinion more than anything. The pork in the ramen was very good. I didn't feel like there was anything special about the broth or bowl itself that made me go omg.  I think I much prefer other ramen joints in toronto, and i'm really glad that we have so many to choose from."}
{"text":"Seriously. Waiting for soooooo long because they prepare take outs first. The noodles were hard and obviously hasn't been cooked for long enough. Soup salty AF. Don't know why I'm back again."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken ramen with extra garlic and been sprouts. Picked up. Came to work. Found out no chicken and no sprouts in it. The price for my soup was almost $16. Honestly does not worth for just broth and noodles. Called to make a complaint. It took them 30 minutes to say nothing they can do and told me they would call back. So no one called back of course."}
{"text":"Extra pork spicy garlic with an egg = hangover cure. The dumplings are ok, a little on the crunchy side."}
{"text":"Classic story of craving ramen: it was a cold and rainy day and I was wanting something warm and nourishing to fill my belly. I usually venture out to Ramen Isshin but I was with a few friends and we were in the Queen West area and thought we'd give Kinton a go. 

We were lucky enough to get there before the lunch rush so we were able to take our time with the menu. I opted for the vegetarian ramen. Although hearty in size, the ramen broth itself was underwhelming and quite tasteless. I had to ask for the spicy seasoning to give it any type of taste. I added on the egg which was delicious and of course a side of corn because corn in ramen is a match made in heaven. One thing that Kinton does well and that I would recommend to anyone vegetarian or not is ordering the tofu nuggets. They gave the appearance of McDonalds chicken nugguts and gave a wonderful texture to a simple dish. The vegetarian ramen came with 2 nuggets but next time (if i go) I would ask for more. 

The decor itself is nice, clean and quite authentic. A communal table sits in front of a large window with additional seating in front of the open kitchen and in the back. Overall it sits about 25 people or so. Lack of vegetarian options, price and taste wont have my going back anytime soon but it was a cool place to try but I'd rather take the time and go to Isshin."}
{"text":"I've had ramen in a few places around Toronto and this was my best experience with it so far. I ordered the Spicy Garlic ramen with thin noodles and asked for rich broth after reading other reviews saying that their broth was watery here - I'd recommend doing the same because I felt the flavor to be excellent. 

They had a deal to make your meal a combo (adding an appetizer and a drink for an extra $3). I did it and I'm very happy I did - the chiki chiki don was excellent and the Japanese tea was served in a cute mason jar. 

I felt the location to give a fairly authentic Japanese vibe, the ramen to be flavorful, and the price to be reasonable (me and my boyfriend together dined for $30 before tip). 

If I could do it all again, I'd also order the swiss cheese with ramen like the couple next to us did - it's $3.50 extra but when we saw how much cheese they brought out we realized it could easily serve us both and it sounds tasty! Oh well, next time :)"}
{"text":"Prices jacked up way too much nowadays at this ramen chain. They charge for everything nowadays compared to before. Would not be going back. I prefer other ramen places around Yonge and Dundas."}
{"text":"For the second time in my life I am now a KINTON Bowler! Take that mom and dad, Saying I'd never amount to anything!

I've only ever gone to KINTON II so when I was invited to go to KINTON III by a co-worker I said, \"Absolutely, it's soup weather!\"

Aesthetically KINTON III is almost exactly the same as KINTON II and the food offering is somewhat similar though with a slightly condensed menu. This wasn't really an issue as coming from work I like less choices because it means I can make a choice quickly and get right back to my favourite thing, work. So really my thoughts on KINTON III are exactly the same as my hypothetical review of KINTON II. So really I don't think I need to elaborate.

However, there is one thing I cannot sit idly by and watch any longer! This is in regards to a drastic change that has occurred since my visit to KINTON II. It would appear that the delectable seasoned egg that used to be in select ramen is no longer included and now is only available at an extra cost of $1.50 (all costs CAD). This is completely ridiculous as I could go out and buy 12 eggs for three dollars literally anywhere. Alternatively I could buy a chicken and produce unlimited eggs and almost no cost!. When we asked our waitress to explain this bullshit change and she gave us a bullshit response and I for one will not take it! A dozen eggs don't cost $18.00 KINTON!!! You know how I know they don't cost $18.00 a dozen? Because if they cost $18.00 I wouldn't be here writing a yelp review of your restaurant, I'd be out harvesting eggs from my successful chicken farm."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of ramen (and I'm not talking Mr. Noodle). Kinton was a great choice to go in K town if your looking for a great atmosphere, along with great ramen of coarse.

Lunch is not only delicious but extremely affordable. I would recommend all things pork with the large noodles option. In total about $13 got you a large bowl of ramen (with one of the best pork bellies I've had) and your choice of side (also really good).

I will be coming back for you one day Kinton."}
{"text":"(4.5*)

Came in for late night dinner, not a first time at a kinka family business, but a first time for the ramen side of the family. Tried out the Kinkalcious for 2k17 Winterlicious was about 24$ after tax.

I had the Pork Miso Ramen (So it doesn't say on the menu but you can choose whatever ramen like you normally would have if you were just ordering normally), the 2 pieces of karaage and 2 gyoza, ans the black sesame pudding.

The soup was perfect, right amount of salty, sweet, and savoury. The porkwas melting in my mouth and the sweet corn and bean sprouts made the texture altogether amazing. The noodles were handmade and also made to perfection. 

The gyoza seemed like packaged gyoza as Kenzo's bay and dundas location has beautiful and juicy handmade ones. The karaage here was on the oily side compared to KINKA Izakayas so it made the breading soggy after a while. The sauce paired was amazing.

Lastly the black sesame pudding was not pudding, it was so much more of a mousse and I enjoyed every bite; not too over powering and the sesame seeds were grounded enough to have this pretty look. 

The meal made me full and satisfied will definately come back for my ramen cravings but not the gyoza cravings."}
{"text":"When it's cold outside, ramen is the perfect meal to warm you up. My friend and I stopped in for a quick lunch and to get out of the cold. Service was pretty quick. Their menu is straight forward - pork or chicken broth, chose from 4 different flavours, thin or thick noodles, cut of meat, and any additional toppings you might want. Last time I went I tried the the spicy garlic pork belly ramen. It was very spicy and the minced garlic actually come on top so you can choose to mix it all in or just a bit. Glad they do that then people can decide how much garlic is good for them. They also have hot and cold tapas items for sharing, and Sapporo on tap and bottles of Asahi."}
{"text":"Okay. I ordered the lunch special with the octopus balls and the shoyu ramen with pork belly. Also had a beer mojito. The octopus balls came quickly and were good. But after this I had to wait 15 minutes for my ramen, which seems excessive as ramen is usually delivered to the table within minutes of ordering. Also, whenever I have ordered ramen before it comes with an egg. There was the option to order an egg in my ramen for an extra charge, but I didn't want 2 eggs. There was also an option for green onion at an extra charge, but green onion was in my ramen. The presentation of the pork belly in a long strip on top is impressive, but the meat was dry (odd for a fatty strip of pork), and hard to chew in one long strip.

Overall, service was only ok. I waited for a long time. The ramen was tasty, but I was super hungry, so anything would have hit the spot. I came back here because of something my boyfriend said \" I really wanted to like that place because they had that AWESOME PIG out front.\" Said pig truly is awesome, but after a second visit, this place had left me a little cold."}
{"text":"Aaah. On a cold winter's night, when you're craving a warm bowl of ramen, please come to Kinton Ramen on Queen. 

Absolutely love their broth (you can't go wrong with which ever one you choose). It hits the spot and is the right serving size for a single hungry yelper. The service is quick. The food is warm and filled with umami. I ordered the Pork Shoyo this time. It is a more creamy, salty broth. Add that extra egg (it's worth it!) The price is ok with good quality ramen. Approximately $13.50 with that added egg."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place and turned out disappointed. The ramen lacked a lot of flavor. The garlic oil tasted like water. I order the special kagoshi ramen. It was very plain, not as special as advertised, not spicy and not rich in flavor as they explained. I would recommend the miso if you are looking for flavorful ramen. The best thing I had that night was the gyoza and the chicken Karaage oh and the hot saki. Ohhh and beware they charge for EVERY SINGLE ADD ON but then forgot my extra noodles that I asked for twice."}
{"text":"Do I really need to write about this?

I think that just saying the two words, \"Kinton Ramen\", doesn't need more to be added. 

I don't care what Toronto life or any other magazine say about Kinton that is #3 on the table of best ramen in town, to me, Kinton is #1. 
And I tried the others (especially those rated #1 and 2 on the table); Me and those very few Japanese friends I have who were born and raised in Japan, still thinking Kinton is the best. 

That's all."}
{"text":"Simple but good selection. Quick service. Ingredients great, broth pretty good. Small place, funky decor."}
{"text":"This is the first ramen place I tried in Toronto.  The broth is not as salty as some other ramen places I have tried.  The pork belly was thin and tasty.  It looks like pre-made and chef use torch to do the final touch up before serving.  I think there are too much bean sprouts in the soup.  The egg is just good but not the greatest.  

I went into the restaurant around 5 pm to 5:30 pm.  There were only few customers in the restaurant.  I waited about 15 minutes before server took my order."}
{"text":"KINTON has some of the best ramen noodles out there.  The noodles are incredibly chewy, smooth, and if I dare say, bouncy (?). I just love the texture of their noodles!  I came here twice and got to try two different broths. The first one I tried was the spicy garlic one.  It wasn't as spicy as I hoped but the broth was pretty great. It's a rich tonkotsu broth (my fav) and it's amI do feel like the portions are a little small but I still feel full enough after a bowl.  The second time I was at KINTON, I tried the Miso pork ramen. It's salty and SOOO satisfying.  It's also very creamy. 

Basically all of the tables here are community tables, so get comfortable with sharing a table with everyone. Although the place is very crowded and busy, the vibe is very friendly. I enjoyed both of my visits very much!"}
{"text":"I could eat here once a week, easy.

I always get the original broth, extra pork (shoulder, belly mix), thick noodles. I always love it.

It's not the only Ramen game in town, maybe not even my favorite, but multiple locations mean that I go here more than the others, and I always enjoy it."}
{"text":"This was good. It was my first time ever having ramen and I liked that the guy was really helpful and the food came quite quickly. The prices were average and the waiters were really sweet, they all yelled or sang or something to us on our way out - I can't imagine it was just for us, they must do that for most people?
Anyway, it's a good option for when you're in the hood. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, it didn't blow me away, but it's solid."}
{"text":"It was super packed when we got here. We luckily got seated immediately and our server was super nice. I enjoyed the pork miso ramen. It came with three slices of thick pork, corn, and thick noodles (depends if you want thin or thick). The broth was a little salty but it was delicious and the price was average. Totally would come back!"}
{"text":"The spicy Chicken Ramen is amazing the chicken brest is flawless you won't get any chewey surprises. 

Adding the garlic to the ramen is highly recommended. 

The only downside is they don't take to go orders over the phone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been trying out different ramen restaurants in the city, and Kinton Ramen on Queen St. We've determined is our winner! The soup was just delicious. I made sure to get double pork the second time I visited as I made the mistake of not doing so the first time. The broth is so flavourful and the ball of minced garlic made it even better. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the Kinton Ramen locations and always had a good experience. They all have a great noodle bar atmosphere. The ramen is always good but maybe a bit on the pricier side compared to some other places. Overall, I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Food: First time \"Meh\", second time \"Good\". Service: minimal but efficient. Overall: overhyped

I've been to Kinton twice. A 3.5 would probably be more accurate but it's more of a 3 than a 4. As the rating suggests, the experience was decent but perhaps the place is overhyped and somewhat overpriced. 

The first time, I had the vegetarian ramen which was rather lacking in flavour there were elements that were decent... The broth was actually fairly tasty, the noodles had a really nice texture but somehow it didn't seem to mesh together to make a coherent whole. Actually the most interesting part of the dish were two little soy nuggets that tasted eerily like chicken.

The second time was the miso broth with pork belly. Overall flavour was better this time but the belly was dry and sort of grey. Not very appealing looking. But again, despite the discomfort induced by the huge portion, I ate it all. The broth and noodles are quite spectacular, to be fair.

Oh and $2.50 Sapporo pints Sunday to Thursday.

Service was decent, nothing to write home about, food delivery was timely. Tables are long communal ones which can be fun or annoying depending on your mood, and on your neighbours. Overall: would recommend, but I won't be going out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place is narrow like most downtown ramen places and theres someone shouting a greeting in Japanese as you walk in. We both went with the ramen cambo (a bowl of ramen plus an app). I got the original pork ramen with thick noodles and a mini chicken don. The don was good, the chicken had a charred aftertaste. 

The ramen however, was definitely not good. The portions are quite large and the price is okay for 10.99. The egg was delicious, with a semi-melty yolk and a strong tea flavour in the egg whites. The broth was salty however and just didn't taste that appetizing. The noodles were nothing special, they clumped together a lot which made it harder to eat. The pork was probably the worst, it was thick, rubbery and had a weird aftertaste that reminded me of plastic. 

The service was alright, but the server who gave us the bill charged us extra and when we asked about it she said that they charge every item separately and \"that's just how the bill works\". Okay but if we ordered 2 12.99 dishes, how is the subtotal 27.88 instead of 25.98? Like what? We had to flag down another server who actually realized the mistake and fixed it. 

Honestly, I'm not a picky eater so the fact I didn't like this place probably says a lot, haha. This is the first Kinton location I've been to and while I can't speak for the other ones, I'd say the Queen street location is a bust."}
{"text":"Love ramen, I've tried a couple of places now and I think overall Kinton is my favourite so far.  I really like how the noodles are made here.  I've tried the Miso, Original, and Shoyu all with extra pork, rich broth and THICK noodles.  Of the three I've tried Shoyu is still my favourite.  Like the pig that I am I order two bowls of ramen each time, ready for that Kinton Ramen Challenge when it happens again.

The staff here are super friendly and in typical Japanese fashion they greet everyone who comes in with a roaring welcome.  Dining is in close quarters with two giant communal tables, the bar table, and a couple of smaller tables for two.  I'm personally not a fan of sitting on the wooden block chairs but that's a personal preference.  

Decor, well it is a ramen shop so don't expect 5-star interior design look and feel, but the place is well kept and clean.

Whenever I crave ramen I definitely come here.  I would recommended for anyone who likes ramen to come and try Kinton out, it may become your favourite ramen spot."}
{"text":"This place is really busy during lunch hours. Came here and pretty much stood there for at least 5 mins before anyone came and served. I ordered pork miso ramen for take out. Hands down its one of the best ramen in town. The broth was very flavourful, smooth and milky. A little bit on the salty side, but it's all good. The noodles are cooked to the perfect texture, chewy yet not tough. I don't think I can get this quality of ramen anywhere else but Kinton."}
{"text":"A nice place to enjoy ramen overall. Their shio pork ramen never disappointed me. 

Some of the reviews said this place is pricy, but the truth is that it is an average priced ramen restaurant.

The only downside is that the seating is not comfortable at all, maybe that's their way to make people eat quickly and go away."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen joints - the takowasabi is a must order as well. I ordered the vegetarian ramen and really enjoyed the noodles and tofu nuggets. The whole dish was really well made. 

I like sitting by the bar and watching food being prepared, it really makes you appreciate an efficient assembly line for quick turnaround times. 

As a bonus, we came on a weeknight and there was no lineup! Win."}
{"text":"So having eaten at probably all the ramen shops in toronto, kinton doesn't crack the top 3 but I WILL give it consideration to crack top 5 (prolly 5 or 6 imo).

Pick your broth flavour (be sure to ask for \"rich\" broth after u pick your flavour since it's now considered secret menu so to speak; hence why so many ppl complaining about watered-down broths as opposed to when they first opened). I've tried all the broths and theyre all quite tasty though not the best in the business.

Go with thick noodles, trust bro. One thing that gets a minus from me is the fact that only their original sea salt (shio) ramen includes an egg when the kingpin counterparts (sansotei, ryus, etc.) all include it at no extra charge. Not only that, the egg tends to be slightly overdone at kinton (runny yolk that turns more hardboiled as it reaches the edges instead of fully runny).

The \"new\" menu revamp (not really that new anymore) also doesnt distinguish pork belly and pork shoulder anymore so ull be getting one slice of each (unless u order the extra pork option). I always order the extra pork option. You get triple the pork! Mmmmmmm porkkkkk. Extra pork IS a lil on the pricy side though so if you're all about value then maybe think twice. Pork belly more fatty while shoulder is more lean. Both very tender still. You can request for more of either one over the other I think?? 

The age gyoza is the best side dish at kinton. Um, prolly try it at least once. k thanks

Service is always on point at all the kintons (been to all of them).

Pros: very good/decent ramen and broth, great chashu, great service, great casual atmosphere

Cons: a lil bit on the pricier side in relation to its contemporaries (excluding santouka cuz santouka is \"wtf\" expensive lol), egg is not always properly done, lots of bowl customization needed to feel full

Like I said, not top 3 but possibly top 5? Definitely top 10 though."}
{"text":"Kinton has been my favourite ramen spot since 2011...  but this location lacks what I love most about Kinton - or at least, Kinton 1 - the gusto and passion of the chefs [and the vocal communication between chefs and wait staff.]. 

What made Kinton notable was ramen, and the experience attached.  The fact that this place lacks the latter just isn't the same.  (Da food still good doe!)"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly unimpressed with the food at Kinton Ramen. I had been meaning to write this review for some time and unfortunately, since that occasion, my memory is still tainted with that horrible experience. My dish had a huge ball of garlic on top that was not mixed into the soup. I ended up having a spoon full of very acidic garlic. It was very, very unpleasant to the point where I no longer had an appetite for anything! I felt nauseous and wanted to puke. The servers noticed my dissatisfaction and did not even care to bring out a new dish. My boyfriend also tried finishing the dish but it was very poorly flavoured. The only flavouring was the huge garlic ball that I swallowed. The soup tasted very watered down and unauthentic. It was shockingly bad.

We barely touched that dish and still had to pay for it. I will never eat at Kinton again and hope that's not how they always serve their dishes."}
{"text":"A must stop anytime I am in Toronto.  Incredible fresh ramen with lively atmosphere.   

Often a wait but well worth it.   Chicken wings are often outstanding as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last minute because it looked nice. We were not disappointed! The staff immediately greeted us and made us feel really happy to be there. We ordered the vegetarian ramen and chicken miso ramen and everything was delicious. The noodles were al dente which I loved. The atmosphere is eclectic and lively with Japanese bossa nova music playing to keep the mood up and happy! I also ordered the Icho cocktail which is white wine and lemonade with lime juice, it was great! The only complaints I have are that the soup felt quite heavy (it looked and had the consistency of butter) but I think that's because I chose the miso option, so I will definitely be back to try more options soon! Also I was apprehensive about the chefs using their bare hands to cook and handle the raw food. But it was cooked properly afterwards so I didn't mind very much. Loved it. Left happy and full."}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy garlic pork ramen with thin noodles and an egg and a pint of Sapporo and my friend Lilliane ordered the spicy chicken jalapeño ramen with bean sprouts and a sake mojito. 

Both soups were absolutely fantastic .....nice spicy broth ....warm for the tummy, the handmade noodles were delicious and maybe a little too many noodles in the bowl but very very very good. 

Will certainly return to be able to try a couple of the other Ramen dishes"}
{"text":"Have been to Kinton Ramen (3 in particular) several times, and is one of my regular haunts when I get ramen cravings (which happens a lot more often than I care to admit).

When it comes to ramen, Kinton is definitely one of the best in terms of flavours, value / bang for your buck, and consistency. Not to mention that Kinton has one of the most diverse menus of all of the ramen joints in Toronto. (Abu-ramen, anyone?)

The food at Kinton Ramen 3 is solid. For under $15, you can get a really hearty bowl of ramen with big and thick pieces of pork, a seasoned marinated egg, WITH some additional toppings to make one really tasty bowl. My favourite is the shoyu pork ramen (rich broth, of course!) with thick noodles, pork belly, and adding the sweet corn and seasoned marinated egg. It does not get better than that.

If you get the chance, please do try the abu-ramen at 3 (or maze ramen if you go to 5!) as it's a totally different experience and taste compared to regular bowls of ramen that are commonly found in Toronto.

The service is usually prompt and friendly, though they do get a bit flustered when the dinner rush is at full tilt, but they are usually attentive and quick to act if you flag them down and ask for something.

I'm a big fan of Kinton in Toronto, because I feel like they make the most consistent and delicious ramen in the city. You'd be hard pressed to find such large portions for the same price, let alone the flavours present in all of the different broths and bowls they put together."}
{"text":"Ramen is always a good idea in my opinion, but not all ramen is good. I was very happy my friend from Japan suggested this spot. It was great! they have the four types of broth original, miso, spicy, and soy. This is my first time ever trying chicken broth but i kept with pork as my meat with the thin noodles. Its a great portion size, I shared with my friend and we were both full. The pork was my favorite part the flavor was just excellent. Great find, i would go back. (btw price was about $14 with tax)"}
{"text":"HOT/COLD SAKE & BIG MUG BEER AND PORK RAMEN?! It's my favourite combo~ the staff are friendly the food is always fillingly delicious, and I'm determined to win myself a Kinton bowl! The prices are reasonable like my go to is a simple pork Ramen + Big Mug(must try) = $25 or if you like hot Sake + Ramen= $16ish or one of my favs to go for is Miso Ramen + sake + Sapporo mini= UNDER $25! BRUH RAMEN IS THE FOOD OF THE GODS!! It's my favourite place to go! Noise level is like calm to average so if you peeps are sensitive to noise level it's more tolerable than other ramen places which is nice! The atmosphere has a homey feel and is delightful! The lighting is warm-bright but not irritating and I always enjoy sitting at the bar :3 always will be coming back! If you guys are more of the quite type try grabbing a seat around 2:30pm."}
{"text":"It was just ok but the atmosphere really ruined it for me. Overall, I don't think I'll be returning.
Pass on the ramen fad here; check out others near the area.

Food: 2/5, I got the pork miso ramen.  The noodle were fine but the meat wasn't very tender and the soup base wasn't as flavourful. The wooden spoon you get is also not the best to consume the broth.  The combo also came with a rice bowl and both the chicken and pork versions were just canned tuna type meat with sushi rice and mayo on it... 

Service: 2/5, not much other than bringing the food. They are quite busy so they cannot really be attentive.

Ambience: 1/5, this is where it failed for me. Just a very cramped place with terrible small wooden stool. I get that it's Japanese and they want to be authentic but the stools are for children and other patrons are too close for comfort.  It's also very loud overall and doesn't make a nice dining experience.

Price: 2/5, about $18 per person and not worth it for what is around with other amazing Asian noodle joints that can offer something better for half the price."}
{"text":"I heard good reviews about this place from friends and, with this being the third franchise for Kinton Ramen, I can see, & now have tasted, why. I ordered the shio pork ramen in a light soup with thick noodles and pork shoulder. Our family ended up ordering all the flavours they offer - shoyu, miso, & spicy jalapeno.  I loved my order - not too salty and the overall flavour was well-rounded. For my family members, some found the shoyu soup salty (it has soy sauce in it); the spicy jalapeno was good but caution - spicy lovers will find it just right...those that can't take spice well will definitely feel the heat. The miso was really yummy, no complaints. Also ordered the goyzu dumplings which were delish with their yimmy sauce.

Service was great - friendly and accommodating.  

I'd come here again or maybe check out the other locations. When you're here, ask about the Kinton Bowler rewards program - every time you finish a whole bowl, you get your card punched out and reach reward levels at 10 bowls, 30, 50, 100, 500, & even 1000. So if youre gonna love kinton ramen, make sure to get your card stamped!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Everything but the broth in my shoyu pork shoulder ramen was good. The broth was just way too salty for my liking. The takoyaki balls, however, were surprisingly really good. I've tried takoyaki balls at the at other locations and they were either too small or had too much batter and not enough meat. The takoyaki at the Queen location had a good balance of meat and batter and were decently-sized. 

On another note - this is the first time I've seen a bathroom so well equipped! There were extra accommodations in the women's bathroom (they had pads and Q-tips!) 

Compared to the Baldwin location, I would say that Baldwin is just better in terms of their broth (and therefore, better quality ramen in general - broth is what makes the ramen). The Queen location is just okay - bonus points for nice bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday, it was really good food, first time trying out ramen. I noticed when my friend and I sat that someone came into the restaurant was looking for a waiter but no one was in the front. I kind of felt bad for the guy who walked in and decided to leave. Totally want to go back for seconds but hoping what happened to that guy doesn't happen to me."}
{"text":"Dropped by during lunch hour. I had the Shoyu ramen with pork belly and thin noodles. This is only the third ramen house I've tried though I'm not unfamiliar with various Asian 'noodle bowls'. So far this is my favourite. What I like about their broth is that it's not salted to death like the other two places I've been to. It's still flavourful. Noodles were nicely done - I lean towards chewy noodles as a preference. Overall I was happy with my meal. 

Service friendly and efficient. Establishment clean."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure why this place has such mediocre ratings. I live down the street where there's a ramen place literally next door but I always take a walk to Kinton. The original rich broth is salty and full, the thick noodles and the pork belly are a match made in ramen heaven. The marinated, soft boiled egg always steals the show. The chicken karaage is one of the best I've tasted so far. The servers are always adorable and kind."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 ramen spots. The spicy ramen is good and I don't find myself needing to add more chilli flakes. The broth is not too thick or watery, with just the right amount of flavouring (regardless of which base you order). This is also why people don't mind going innnn and drinking until the last drop (the servers will actually praise you and take a photo with you if you finish everything in your bowl!). Service is quick and staff are always smiling. Always busy, but waiting times aren't that long (5-10 mins MAX) so making a reservation isn't quite necessary. There's even a coat rack by the front door!"}
{"text":"First time I've had ramen in the city.  Found it very tasty and filling. I also found it to be a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"My first time at Kinton Ramen, and it was a very delightful experience. Seated at the cooking counter and watching the process of you food being made for you was a total delight. The wait staff are totally charming and very attentive to your needs.
My order of spicy pork belly with egg and thick noodles was very delicious. If you are a garlic lover, which I am. There was enough to ward off any vampire. The soup was spicy but not over powering, savory to the last drop. I highly recommend this place for the more discerning Ramen devoutly. I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"My fave and cheap Ramen place!!!! So delicious and cheap.  Did I also mention 2.99 hogtown tall boys from sun -Thurs? ? I crave it every week.. I highly recommend the think spicy garlic broth. Yummmm !!"}
{"text":"I found that for the price the portion wasn't enough, I'm a 6'6 man and like to eat, for $15 bucks or so it didn't fill me at all. Beautiful set up inside and the tables were real nice. It got the feeling it's quality not quantity."}
{"text":"Had the chicken ramen, only has two pieces of chicken breast, the noodle seems to be not cooked thoroughly. The place is very crowded. However, the sun shines through and if you get a window seat it feels warm and cozy."}

-slow service
-price per topping
-chicken tastes artificial"}
{"text":"Very happy with this place!  I personally LOVE the flavour of the spicy garlic pork-broth ramen!  Makes me sweat, but so filling and satisfying for a good price!

Didn't love the few sides that I tried, so I just stick with a simple, big bowl of ramen ... it's more than enough for me."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to ramen place, no more waiting in a ridiculously long line for Sansotei!

Menu: http://www.kintonramen.com/img/menu/kinton_english.pdf

What we had: original pork ramen, spicy garlic pork ramen

Taste: 9/10

The broth here is really flavourful and rich. I'm pretty sure they chuck in butter to that broth like they're Paula Deen. The spicy garlic broth was on the salty side, not too spicy. The original broth was delicious: rich and full of meat flavour. Noodles have a good chew to them, pretty standard. The seasoned egg here isn't as deliciously runny as Sansotei's, but the chashu meat quality is definitely better. 

Value: 7/10

It's $11 for a bowl, and you can add more toppings that cost $1-2 each. We didn't add anything.

**Average cost per diner: 14$ After Tax+Tip (Although Steven wasn't as hungry as usual when we went.)

Service/Convenience: 8/10

The place is easy to locate, you'll notice the piggy sign in front. When you enter, they all yell at you in Japanese (probably to say welcome, but they could be saying \"you're smelly\" for all I know). There's no line, which is awesome, although we did wait a while for our order to be served. Servers are polite and efficient. 

Would go back? Yes, their savoury ramen soup is great for warming up in the winter. 

Would recommend to friend? Yes, if they like soup noodles.

Similar places: Hokkaido Ramen Santouka, Sansotei

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"Best ramen ive had in the city!! The restaurant has a great look and atmosphere and all of the staff great you as soon as you walk in! Super friendly servers and the ramen is just delicious and always presented so perfectly!"}
{"text":"Yummy, just not enough Umami

I had the Original ramen and the broth was missing the warm loving feeling I expect from a bowl of beautiful steaming noodles. My friends ordered the Shoyu and Spicy Garlic, because they too felt the Original was lacking. 

I will return and try another flavour, because the restaurant is really unique with their long community sharing tables, the beautiful and very friendly servers, and the appetizers we had were quite good, Age Gyoza, Takoyaki (deep fried octopus balls), and the Hot Karaage (spicy fried chicken). The Karate was excellent and I would have tucked int a whole plate if it was on the menu.

I will also return based on my feeling towards a wonderful evening I sent at their sister restaurant in Montreal, KINKA IZAKAYA. There are a few locations in Toronto, which I need to try.

Like any respectable Ramen place they love their pigs and KINTO RAMEN pay homage to the tasty beast by posting industrial images around the restaurant. There's a big lit pig out front, one in the hall way to the toilets and one on the mirrors in the toilet. They don't let you forget who you really need to thank for the tasty morsels."}
{"text":"Just ordered take-out from Kinton Ramen 3 and I'm pretty bummed about it. 
Had the cold ramen salad.

menu says mixed vegetables - what you get is canned corn and a couple of sliced baby tomatoes over some lettuce and bean sprouts. the ramen is too chewy and the sesame dressing is is really heavy with a grainy underflavour. It was also pricey.

Might go back to try the soup, might not."}
{"text":"Really good ramen.  Spent a few years in Japan and been a snob for ramen. This place is legit.  Got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it was really good.  Spice level, broth temperature, noodle texture and flavor was on point! Good job KINTON Ramen Shop!"}
{"text":"1) They got my order wrong
2) What I got was barely adequate for the price. Nondescript noodles in a flavour-deficient broth. Pork belly was decent. 
3) The waitstaff told my party that we had to move further into the restaurant to accommodate some random family with children. 

There many other places in the city to get better ramen than this."}
{"text":"The pork broth is pretty good and good bounce on the ramen noodles, but if you just get the regular, you don't really get toppings. Adding in the veggies that I get at other places (that come with the bowl already), like mushrooms, corn and bean sprouts, is $1 each, which then really hikes up the price.

Servers are quick but all the ones I interacted with don't really speak English (and I don't speak Japanese well), so at some point when I had questions it really was him nodding his head trying to understand and then me giving up lol."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good until 2 months ago, everything goes down hill.
I am a regular customer due to the location close to my office. I experience the change of the food quality.
They used to have option between pork shoulder and pork belly on their menu, but they recently take that option away.
Their pork is now very salty and super thin cut. Less noodle per serving and soup base isn't the same.
I missed the old days when they were good, but from now on I will limit my visits."}
{"text":"Don't think I will go back to this one. I usually go to Kinton on Baldwin. For some reason the spicy ramen tastes better at Baldwin. Doesn't help that both waitresses forgot to give us water and we had to ask why our beer took so long too. Hard to talk. Won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"Cool trendy place. All the cool cats must come here for ramen. Delicious food, we love being shouted at when we enter. Two kinds of soup base, pork and chicken.  My daughter loves the thick udon noodles. And the spicy garlic just goes right through you. Great place!"}
{"text":"I am currently visiting Toronto, and I found out about Kinton Ramen via Yelp.

My party of 3 had to wait to be seated, as the restaurant is pretty small and has limited seating. There were only a few workers there, and as a rush of customers came through, they seemed to struggle with handling many customers.

We ordered 2 pint sized Sapporos, which were actually pretty big. We also ordered 1 original pork ramen with extra noodle, 1 shoyu chicken, and 1 spicy garlic with pork. For the extra noodle it is required that you order it when you make your original order, as you cannot ask for it after you have finished. Overall, the food was very good. They give you a good amount of pork, and the thin noodles are chewy but good. The broth was not as greasy and oily as most ramen places, which was a big plus for me (way thinner broth than Shinsengumi in LA). Overall, very good ramen, which good quantity!"}
{"text":"This review is for Celiacs/gluten freers - not of much use to those that are able to enjoy the regular options.

While I am ever so grateful that they have gluten friendly options, I really wish they would use different noodles. The sweet potato noodles they use are 'glassier' than the regular kind (they are the glass noodles of Korean cuisine if I am not mistaken) and thus they do not absorb any of the delicious (and heavy broth). I've never not eaten there and not felt sick, like a puddle of oil is swishing about in my stomach. Other noodles with more absorbency and carb would help to counteract the heaviness of the oil, much like in a regular ramen.

Don't get me wrong, I loooove some sweet potato noodles in Korean cuisine (those side appetizers!) but not in a heavy ramen broth. They don't add anything to each other nor do they work well together."}
{"text":"The Hot Karaage (fried chicken with hot and sour sauce) is worth trying. The shoyu ramen has subtle flavours whereas the pork ramen is like a warm hug, perfect meal for a rainy day :)"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is one of the BEST spots for lunch and dinner, with a group or single, regular or once a month, and is especially true for special occasions like a date or with someone new in town.

The selection is varied, taste is high-tier, seating space is abundant, atmosphere is pub-like, and the overall experience is enjoyable.

They occasionally have the special ramen-of-the-month bowls where they offer a different combination or theme of ingredients. Be sure to check their Facebook page to see what's new.

Overall, I can recommend Kinton Ramen. Be sure to come around 11am before the 12pm rush."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and reliable ramen. I love the original flavor with pork, sometimes with garlic oil. The spicy garlic flavor is good too if you have a spice tolerance. Good place to get your ramen fix!"}
{"text":"My first real ramen experience and I was impressed with the fast service, for a smaller restaurant they really have a great service flow and it's fun to sit in front of the action and watch the food being cooked.

I went with the spicy garlic pork. I wasn't thinking when I tipped the entire scoop of garlic into my dish but I regretted it immediately for fear of smelling like it for days (apparently no one the next day thought I was too bad lol) 

My bf ordered the pork miso and I think this is the way to go, although less flavourful it was ideal for both of us. We added egg & seaweed. Also the corn in this one gave it a nice texture.

Kimchi was good, spicier than I would've anticipated to but I enjoy spicy food."}
{"text":"I have become a complete and utter Kinton Ramen addict. 

I had been following Kinton Ramen on Instagram way before ever having visited one of their noodle shops and every photo convinced me I needed this in my life. 

When my fiance and I finally were able to make a trip down to one of the noodle shops, it was a glorious experience. We arrived early as I had heard of long wait times to get in and we were sat immediately. The location was cozy and the menu made ordering incredibly easy for a first timer.

I ordered the miso ramen with pork belly. No extra additions. I wanted my first time to be simple and to really taste the flavours before adding too much on top. 

When the bowls came out, I couldn't believe how big they were for the price. Is it even possible to finish one of these!? But after taking my first bite, it was impossible to put the spoon down. The broth is rich and every bite brings more complex flavours. The only thing slowing me down was my inability to pick up noodles with chopsticks!

Since my first visit, I have been completely hooked. I have ordered ramen through Uber Eats, which delivers from a different Kinton location, however each time the quality bar is incredibly high. 

... Oh man... Now I'm craving ramen again... 

Might have to make another quick stop in!!

-Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"I love their Chiki Chiki Don. So good, I get it every time.

I ordered the pork ramen (miso) with nori (extra cost). Their ramen isn't the best, but it's still yummy. I personally think that their broth is way too salty for my taste, but I try to finish it for the stamp card, anyways.

Totalled to just under $16. Really filling meal and good for the price! The employees are always so friendly."}
{"text":"I've had the miso ramen here a couple times and I'm a fan. I also like it with the thicker noodles because I enjoy the extra chew they provide. The lunch combo with the extra side is totally worth. I think it works out to an extra dollar for some gyoza. The gyoza come with a curious sweet sauce that I can't quite pinpoint but it is tasty. This place also has the vibe down for an izakaya, but that also means it can be a little noisy as well. I definitely would go back to kinton for a ramen fix."}
{"text":"Looking at all the 4-star reviews here you would think Kinton is still preparing good authentic ramen, but whether a question of natural aging, big business owner getting lazy or franchising diluting their attention the broth at Kinton is now diluted, thin, tasteless and, dare I say it, blasé.

A good ramen has good noodles, but also the broth has to have depth. By the way, depth does not mean oil. Depth means richness from hours of crafting a deep taste based on the flavour of the soup be it miso or shio or whatever. Kinton is now serving watery oil broth.
Guys, I know you don't actually hire ramen chefs, but at least train your cooks a little.

The other thing that Kinton used to do well was the atmosphere and greetings and that has been watered down too. They still welcome you apparently, but on a select basis. We were not welcomed in the old fashion, but another person who entered after us was. Even that welcome was half as exciting as before.

Kinton is still better than the oddly disappointing and fake Touhenboku, but Santouka, Sansotei ,Raijin and Ryus are better.

Kinton is not my favourite. Their broth is bland and has no depth."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal, better service here than Baldwin st. We go every time we go to Toronto and this will continue to be the case. Our group preferred the spicy broth over the original but the pork was super flavorful"}
{"text":"Chill spot w limited large shared tables for seats.
Got the original pork broth (not that flavorful), pork belly( long tender strips slightly charred), and thick noodles( though they were tough, not al dente). kind of pricey for the quality though quantity was fine. Ive had better."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is Kinton's quality slipping? Spreading themselves too thin? I ordered my usual shio ramen and the pork was bland. Like it was steamed and torched as an afterthought. No seasoning. The soup on the other hand was really really salty with chunks of fat. There was no egg either... Just that day or just this location? 
The one upside, no line ups."}
{"text":"Omg I don't wanna be mean but this is the worst ramen I've ever got in my life. Spicy garlic, I ordered rich soup but it tastes like water... Feel like I ate a bowl of ramen in water:("}
{"text":"This place is always busy and as usual there is always a wait. 

The ramen here is always delicious. The broth was up to quality; the flavour is strong. Their extra meat option gives you a bigger portion than the other locations. However, the meat here was not that great. It's dryer and tougher.

I usually ordered my ramen with thick noodles whereas my boyfriend likes his with thin noodles. He finds that it absorbs the broth the best and you're able to taste the flavour better. 

Portions of noodles are pretty small; I alone can finish one bowl of ramen minus the soup. My boyfriend usually adds extra noodles and extra pork. If you're a big eater I recommend you add extra noodles. You're only allowed to add noodles when you first order. 

Overall, it is very filling and makes you feel bloated after."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place considering my friends over sold it. 

There's only pork or chicken stock as the base. So if you don't eat either (such as myself) you're already screwed. And no beef and seafood aren't options. 

There was the vegetarian ramen and i didn't finish it. I had maybe two bites before I left it. It was just not that good. 

My friend was pretty much the same. She said it was okay but not a place she would be eager to return it. She liked the rice dish though. 

This place is always busy or full of large groups of people. Just keep that in mind if there's only two of you."}
{"text":"Ill be back. It has everything you need from a ramen spot. Food is great and very quick to order. I dont like the tall chairs tho... I wanna lounge when I am eating raman."}
{"text":"Went there for Ramen yesterday and felt it was OK at the most. I had ordered a chicken ramen and my stepdaughter ordered pork ramen, plus two teas and tip came to $40. Considering Ramen is one of the cheapest noodles to make I felt it was pretty expensive.

The taste was overall good, but my chicken was cold and not quite cooked (from my perspective) I didn't end up eating my chicken. 

The place was small and crowded, seating very squishy and a bit uncomfortable. Service was quick but not overly friendly, felt very rushed. They were pretty busy. I wouldn't come here again, I prefer Asjian Ramen."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place. I feel like I'm in New York. The atmosphere, the food. Ah! The Ramen. Spicy Pork, thick cut noodle, extra veggies & corn. And the tofu! Just Stop! I was introduced to this place and I have only payed it forward by introducing others."}
{"text":"KINTON on Queen is a good alternative to the ever so popular location on Dundas.

I had their spicy garlic ramen and asked for less salt as classic ramens are usually too salty for my liking. I like the fact that they offer a choice between thin and thick noodles. Add an egg for extra deliciousness, and it's the perfect meal for a cold winter day.

We also got a tako wasabi which came with 4 pieces of seaweed with a decent size of the filling. When we asked for a couple more pieces of the seaweed, they told us it was an extra 50 cents for it, which I thought was a bit off putting or maybe I've just been spoiled at other restaurants where they offer free chips for dips?

All the seating here is stool style which can get quite cramped especially with all the thick coats and winter accessories everyone is sporting. I prefer a proper chair personally to relax and enjoy my bowl of ramen.

Service was OK - friendly staff but no one came by to fill our water and we felt a bit rushed in ordering as well as completing our meal.

Ramen at KINTON is not my favourite but it's a convenient go to place on Queen."}
{"text":"Starting this review off with a thumbs up to Kinton for the warm greeting and the great placement and layout of the whole restaurant. I tend to dislike certain restaurants when I'm either seated too close to someone or the vibe of the restaurant is too busy and crowded but Kinton is in it's own category for all that. 

Server sat us down and several minutes later decided it was time for some Original, Extra Pork Belly with Thick Noodles!

Within a matter of 15-20 minutes our party's food came as the restaurant itself wasn't too crowded and wasn't too empty. The server was also very interested in taking our order and very enthusiastic the whole time we were in the restaurant. I'm not sure about anyone else but the server alone can be a star itself. And hats off to our server, tall curly haired fellow with the accent, for making my dinner exceptional. 

The food itself, was incredible. I've always told my friends that the best ramen I've had was Imadake in Montreal but as of right now Kinton is definitely making me rethink that. The soup wasn't too salty, pork was soft, not chewy and the noodles were to my liking. I could actually sip on the soup after I devoured everything inside it. Also, I need to note that when I asked for more water, my server hauled ass to get it to the table. You are a lifesaver (I hate it when I have to wait 15 minutes for water)

All in all, Kinton hasn't given me a reason to give them a negative review so you deserve a 5/5. Well deserved."}
{"text":"I've upped my star rating from 2 to 4 due to the prompt attention of the Kinka/Kinton staff to my less than positive review and their desire to address my complaint and make sure service is always at the level they and we expect it to be!  Thanks."}
{"text":"A small and popular destination for lunch, friendly staff and yummy ramen although the broth was a bit salty. You get to see them make it right in front of you which is a treat. The staff shout you a greeting as you enter and they yell orders in Japanese, a very lively and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to have a good impression of the ramen here but it seems like the quality has dropped since my visit a year ago and the telltale sign was that the soup base was off. I stopped by during lunch and had the Original Shio ($11), the lightest flavour made from seasoning the broth with a bit of salt. It felt like they diluted the bone stock while keeping the oil and salt, so the taste was bland but still heavy. 

The staff were nice, the service was efficient, and the rest of the ramen was alright. But the broth really is the heart of the dish and Kinton was not delivering."}
{"text":"Nice service.
I tried original chicken ramen with pork shoulder as the server recommend, and it was great than I thought.

But it's better to avoid busy time."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto a couple of days ago and was craving ramen. I found that this place was on my way to the great hall for long winter from my hotel, and that it had gotten decent reviews. Let's just say that those are being kind. I got there and was fairly promptly seated, but then the waiting game began. I was there by myself, and the seating communal, so a good conversation starter with the women sitting next to me was wondering aloud when we could order, since they hadn't yet either and they'd already been there a while. When I finally was approached about ordering, I actually told the guy to take the two next to me's order first as they'd been waiting longer. After a while (the wait wasn't egregiously long once we'd ordered), we got our food, though my side dish with my combo was served to one of the women next to me, which was kind of annoying. No matter though, onto the food. The one long strip of Chashu pork was stone cold and sitting atop the noodles, bean sprouts, and corn. That was it, by the way; no kikurage mushrooms, no egg, no bamboo, just noodles, sprouts, corn, and nori, which it looked like I paid a dollar extra just for one more sheet of; I'd've been all right with the three grouped together like they were supposed to be there and not just tossed on top as an afterthought. The real loser here though was the broth. I now understand why things need to be properly seasoned, because I couldn't finish this. Apart from there being so few and sparse corn kernels that I was worried I'd choke on one while drinking the broth, I could see little bubbles of oil, which was about the only flavor there. No pork or miso to speak of. Perhaps the cold Chashu was meant to flavor the broth more, but that's not how broth works. As an added bonus, the two women, whom I'd never met previously, had my food on their bill and we had to get it split once someone finally realized we were done with our food. This was the rare place I didn't tip well because of service. Use some goddamned soy sauce."}
{"text":"Quick and courteous service. I like the option to choose thick vs thin noodles :) so I picked the miso broth bc I thought it would be lighter than the shoyu but my boyfriend got the shoyu and I liked the taste of that better probably because the miso comes with a but if garlic sauce. Both are still very good though. Each bowl had two generous cuts of pork - one pork belly piece and another that was more mostly meat than fat. Both pieces had a bit of a chew to them but were still soft and delicious. I like the bean sprouts that came in each bowl which gave a nice texture and mine came with SO MUCH CORN!! The real reason I went with the miso pork ramen haha, very fresh and sweet taste. The real star of the meal was the panache drink though mmmm so refreshing and cuts the heavy ramen broth and helps you keep eating so easily. A great combination of Sapporo beer and their house made lemonade. Overall, decent ramen place that's open very late"}
{"text":"Of the myriad of ramen shops popping up in the GTA, Kinton is one I frequent for the food and the atmosphere. I had their Paitan cheese ramen with chicken, takoyaki, karaage (plain and spicy), and a pint of Sapporo. The ramen was pretty good and surprisingly filling even without ordering an extra helping of noodles. The broth was very flavourly, despite being a touch heavy in terms of salt (but that's to be expected). The takoyaki that day seemed a little ordinary, but the regular karaage was really good (achieved a crispy exterior and a juicy interior). The spicy karaage seemed overly saucy and did not pack enough heat. My biggest gripe ultimately is that time and again I forget how small the portions for the sides are for what you pay. While not the best,l I'd come back because I enjoy the enthusiastic \"Irasshaimase's\" and the communal ambiance for slurping noodles."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by with friends since we were around the area. Heard that it was good. I ordered spicy garlic soup thick noodles pork. Soup bit lacking. Pork was delicious. Karaage game on point. Not bad ramen but had better."}
{"text":"Decided on Kinton Ramen for brunch.

I picked the chicken broth with the original flavour (sea salt, white onions, scallions, nori and seasoned egg) with the thin noodles (I opted out of the chashu/chicken that came with it). I forgot to ask for no egg and didn't eat it.

I was so happy that their chicken broth was delicious and not heavy!

This came to $13.55 after tax so the price has me hesitating to return especially if you compare it other ramen prices. But it really is good

Service is fantastic! Not a 5 star because of the price."}
{"text":"--- Food ---
I ordered the pork ramen, spicy garlic, with thick noodles. $10.99. I definitely love the thick noodles - the consistency of the noodle was just right. The broth was spicy was expected, very tasty. The pork slices had a slightly burnt taste on the edges, I could taste it, a little on the dry side too, decent. A little sad that the ramen didn't come with at least half an egg (need to order on the side for $1.50). 

My partner ordered from the Specials menu. $12.99 for basically the same thing but with gyoza for side dish as well. The gyoza was okay - interesting sauce! He also ordered green tea for $1 - decent. 

--- Atmosphere ---
There's a long bar inside with a long table near the entrance. Everyone sits closely together. They have a coat rack near the hostess bar to hang your jackets, but I saw some people either wear their jackets or drape it over their lap. It would be nice if they incorporate some little hooks into the table for ladies to hang their small purses though. We all sit closely to one another, I could clearly hear convos to people on left & right. 

Service was good. The food took about 15 minutes to prep. 

--- Overall --- 
My partner and I would likely come here again if we are in that area again."}
{"text":"My pork spicy garlic ramen had cold noodles that stuck together. I mentioned it politely and they offered another bowl!

Great ambience & fast service. A little more veggies would have been perfect"}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch combo today and for $15, you get 2 pieces of gyozas (fried pork dumplings) and 2 pieces of karaage (fried chicken) and a bowl of chicken ramen (I ordered spicy garlic, light broth, thick noodle and chicken breast). I was so full! I drank all the soup too and got another stamp on my Kinton Bowler card :)"}
{"text":"I think I'm just not a fan of ramen. I do like that at Kinton you can customize the strength of the broth - I often find ramen broths a bit too salty. Tried the original light pork ramen with pork shoulder which comes with 2 pieces of pork shoulder and a seasoned egg. The ramen was okay, but nothing spectacular. I got the combo with tako yaki as the side and it was delicious.

Seating is very uncomfortable since it's open seating with bar stools - no private conversations here! There is a coat rack at the front but it'll be an issue if you have purses, bags etc."}
{"text":"best ramen, get miso ramen + pork; you won't go wrong"}
{"text":"Enjoyed 3 things. Ramen was 4.5/5. Dessert was 3/5. Ambiance was 4/5, had to wait a while for party of five. Tip: Washroom is tucked away downstairs to the left of the entrance. 
1- Ramen options chosen -pork original broth with thick noodle it already comes with and egg. The egg was cooked perfectly to my liking; well seasoned. Probably the highlight of the meal.
2- Ramen options chosen: pork spicy garlic broth with thick noodle; ordered an egg with it; $1.50. But I still think this joint knows how to cook their eggs. Gooey in the middle and very tasty alone. 
3- Dessert: sesame pudding was ok. 

Would go back again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Decided to try this Kinton thinking that it might be better than the others which I have generally been disappointed at. Same story here though. The soup is just salty, not flavorful, and as my dining companions and I concluded, the pork shoulder tasted like \"some cheap chinese mystery meat\" - rubbery too. Would not go back again since there are so many other better ramen places downtown."}
{"text":"This a great atmosphere for ramen. love the community tables and the ramen is perfection.  
i have been 4 times now and have not had a bad experience or meal.  Always come away full and happy."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite ramen place in Toronto.  I like the Spadina location as it doesn't seem as busy and really close to other food places (conducive to food hopping!).  Plus you can get a pint of Sapporo for $3.90!

My favorite is the original with either chicken or pork with thick noodles and added fresh garlic.  The fresh garlic is a must.  The broth is rich and satisfying, noodles are chewy, and the chicken is so tender."}
{"text":"I had the shio ramen with regular broth and thick noodles. It was really good. The noodles are just wonderful and the broth wasn't too salty. I've gotta stop writing reviews for ramen - i'm becoming pretty uncreative. ;)"}
{"text":"After a long hiatus from this location (my office location moved), I decided to come back for lunch. Even though it was 12:15pm, there were still seats available. However, it was particularly difficult to find the wait staff. Once seated, I ordered a combo. However, no one provided water.

What I kept noticing was the lack of wait staff. There were 2 people making food and once they finally had dishes ready, they also served as wait staff. However, they were confused about which dishes went to which patrons. When the wait staff finally appeared from the back, there were some arguments with the cooking staff as it seemed like the wait staff wrote down one thing and meant another. It was like watching an episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares unfold in front of me. The person seated next to me just got up and left, telling the wait staff that he had waited 45 minutes.

I received my ramen after 45 minutes. Although the ramen was good, I don't think I will return. The wait was too long and it doesn't seem like the staff knew what they were doing."}
{"text":"As said in my previous reviews.. I'm not a big fan of ramen but I was oddly craving it and we were near by kinton. I've been to their other chains before and I liked it more than other ramen places. There's a wide variety of bases to choose from and I picked the spicy garlic soup with pork. Noodles were chewy and soup was flavourful. I also karage on the side and it tasted good too. You can add more things at additional costs to your Raman and make it a combo as well. Combo consists of a small rice dish either with pork or chicken. Kinton is prob my fav ramen joints and I would come back to any of their locations in Toronto. Huge question though.. what makes ramen so expensive?! Our bill for 2 people after tax and tips was $50! 
Service was great. People checked up on us once in a while. Seating area is small. Sometimes you may get some wait time. 
They accept any kinds of payment."}
{"text":"My favourite one by far. I love their combos and food is delicious. Ramen is always hot and fresh. Yakitori is so good. My go to."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time that i\"ve attended the Kinton Mega Ramen Challenge and i must say that i've enjoyed them both thoroughly.  No, i did not enter the challenges.... eating a large bowl of pork-filled ramen within the 15 minutes limit would have been impossible for me.  Instead, i preferred to take it slow while enjoying each bite of the flavours.  The ramen was ok by itself, but accompanying with the soup, the strands of noodles were very tasty.  The pork slices melted in my mouth as they were so tender.  They were my favourite part of the food in the bowl.  The large bowl of ramen  would set you back $30 if you didn't accomplish the challenge.
Most of all, i loved the energy and cheerful ambience in the restaurant.  I could feel the excitement as participants entered the challenges, and the camera girl visiting the tables, busy taking pictures of customers during the events.  I literally left the restaurant each time like as though i just finished an intensed race.... weird, huh!?!!"}
