{"text":"Rocky's Eastside Pizza, Subs, & Wings 4034 N 24th St Phoenix, AZ  This place is another one not far from our Central Phoenix location.  They are a small place.  HOT as blue blazes in that store when my next to oldest son and I went in to place our order and wait.  My clothes were wet when we came out.   Our order: three 18\" pizza's and 40 wings.  (1 pepperoni, 1 ham and pineapple, and 1 pepperoni, mushroom, and onion. wings were 20 medium and 20 barbeque) total was just under $58.00. Ovens were old gas brick lined ovens. Our wait was maybe 20 minutes.  No customers when we went in and none came in while we were there.  Take that back, one came in and ordered an iced tea. Crust: crispy on the outside, tough and chewy around the edges.  Dough seemed overworked to me.   Toppings: not very generous with them.  Pepperoni was generic, nothing special, mushrooms the same.  I like the onions, the pineapple was okay but the ham was tasteless. Sauce:  that is the one thing we all did like pretty much was the sauce.  I know this will sound nuts but of store bought sauces I like Chef Boyardee, don't ask, why I don't know why, I just do.  To be honest that is how it tasted to me.   Cheese: not bubbly, no string to it, and rather salty after taste.  Wings: both he barbeque and the medium buffalo wing sauce had a bit of vinegar to them.  More that we like.  They were not crispy like we enjoy either. They were better than a lot of others but not something to get excited over.   Overal it was not a horrible experience but not one we would repeat every weekend."}
{"text":"Since leaving the legion of sometimes-delicious, hit-or-miss-depending-how-pissed-the-cook-is greasy spoon pizza joints in Tempe - adieu, Otto's, Tessio's, Venezio's, and Gus's! - for the warm and welcoming arms of central Phoenix, I've been craving a local spot to grab a simple slice.  Sure, central Phoenix has an abundance of nicer pizza joints - Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, Le Gran Orange and the somewhat-classy chain joint Z Pizza - but what about when you want something unhealthily tasty, with an unholy drippiness about its cheese?  Enter Rocky's.  I've tried other places, but this is the first one to fully deliver.  For a mere $5.10 pre-tax, I got two slices of pizza - one with mushrooms and garlic - and some crispy fries.  There was just enough cheese to compliment the tangy tomato sauce without making me feel completely gross, and the crust itself was thin, but didn't soften or get all moist and gross like some cheap pizza does.  The crispness provided a nice balance to the what was on top of it.  I also got some hot sauce, which appeared to be homemade (don't quote me on this) and was delicious.  Also, when it comes to making individual slices, Rocky's does it right.  They don't make a bunch of pizzas and gradually serve the slices like a lot of places - meaning you might get unlucky and get a slice from a pizza made two hours ago.  When I ordered, they had just run out of the last pizza - meaning they had to bake another pizza in order to serve me and the two other customers that came in during the ten minutes I waited.  The atmosphere was also really awesomely eclectic.  First, the music - in the short time I was there, I heard a Johnny Cash b-side, a few hip hop numbers, and some arabic music.  The walls are colorful and covered with various urban-art pieces - and not in the \"fake urban\" way you get at a lot of places.  Finally, the staff was friendly, but not afraid to get sassy with people - a balance you definitely need to walk in Phoenix.  Definitely recommended for noshing in the general 24th St & Indian School area!"}
{"text":"Well what can i say about Rocky's. Its one of the few Pizza places i like to eat from and im not a real Pizza lover.  Pizza is nice thin crunchy crust with an amazing sauce. First time i ate there i ordered a pepporoni slice, and thats where it all started. After that we ordered a full pizza, my wifey was in pizza heaven (major pizza lover) it was delicious, didnt complain one bit. Tried one of there baked subs and it was tasty too.(Meatball Sub)  Wings were great too, nice and spicy and very good.  Only thing is they dont have fountain drinks, they sell soda by the can, tea, gatorade, water and are not open that late. All n all it was good."}
