{"text":"I can't believe that there is another review tonight that was not so good for this place.  We had to wait for about 15 - 20 minutes for a table, but on a Saturday night, I've been to other places where I would be waiting for a table for 45 minutes to an hour.  The food is always good here.  I love their Flautas and I get the combo dinner with rice.  Two Flautas and rice.  The Flautas are crunchy with great beef as in the middle.  The rice is awesome with great flavor!  I understand that people want spicy, but if you are going to Serranos, you won't be getting that big spicy taste, you'll get taste of the food itself! Yum!  The waitress we always get was training the new waitress, but both of them were so nice.  They brought us drinks and our food in a great time manner.  My husband and I had a great time here!    Great place! One piece of advise...get a table not a booth!  They have very small booths!  Tables are better!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Serrano's since it opened. The food is always consistently good. My review tonight is to give credit to an outstanding server. We had been at our table for about 10 minutes and nobody had greeted us yes to get drink orders or even bring chips and salsa. One of the servers, Jeremy, must have recognized the \"I have three grumpy hungry kids\" look on my face and came over to greet us. He apologized that nobody had been over. Although our table was not in his assigned area he took our order and made sure we had what we needed for our time there. He was busy with a lot of big parties and went above and beyond. Great work!"}
{"text":"OMG! Never disappoints! I always order the small party platter for my family to eat at home! Offers a variety for even the pickiest of eaters. So delicious! Thank you"}
{"text":"The bean dip and salsa are remarkably great! Food and service was good as well. Service was fast even though they had a line to get in. Sat at the bar with chips salsa and bean dip derived quickly. It was a short wait for food that arrived fresh and hot, everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Wonderful service especially if u get Beth   Everything outstanding to include the hot bean dip to start things off."}
{"text":"The food here is hit or miss depending on the time you eat. The Margaritas are not cheap and not the best tasting. But the service is just plane bad! They leave you with empty drinks and chips and when you say something about it the manager thinks its funny. Sorry but this long time customer has finally had enough and won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We love this Serranos. The bean dip is awesome. The southwest chicken is yummy. So many good things but what really keeps us coming back are the wonderful employees! Beth, Kennedy, Fabiola are a few of our favorites."}
{"text":"First of all it took a super long time to get our food.  We finally get at our table and it's cold.  I could only eat half and I finally just gave up.  I was hungry but not that hungry.  The first place in a very long time were I feel like I was ripped off.  My Fianc√© 's meal looked disgusting.  She didn't eat either.  We were a table of ten and it didn't  go well for anyone at our table.  I hate writing something like this but I feel like if I can help others then I have to.  There are better places to eat.  So do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Serranos. The food is good. The bean dip is wonderful. The best part of Serranos, though, is the staff. Beth, Laurel, Landon and Kennedy are awesome. Serranos is a good place to take the family. If you live in the area and frequent Serranos I would recommend getting a Serranos Card. You get points for what you purchase and after you get so many points they send you a $10 certificate to spend on food."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant.  My husband and I went in starving and got lucky and got a table right away.  They start you out with the chips, salsa and BEAN DIP which my husband loved!  I ordered the southwestern chicken breast (really great with extra chilis sliced on top) and my husband had his usual enchiladas.  Very good food and our waitress Elizabeth did a wonderful job and kept a close eye on our drinks and was right there with refills.   Very friendly staff in a comfortable atmosphere.  We'll definately be going back!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food.  As usual, you start with chips and salsa.  These were decent.  The salsa had a good amount of cilantro, which I liked, but some may not have a taste for this.  The bean dip had onions, which adds a weird (not good) flavor.  We got the pork machaca which was mediocre.  Also had one of the enchiladas and a tostada, both of which were also mediocre.  The tostada was soggy... not impressed.  Queso - too much sour cream.  This was more like a cheese flavored spinach dip rather than queso.  Service was friendly, which earns them an extra point.  Price is acceptable.  Doubtful I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  The atmosphere is authentic enough to feel like it's good mexican, but not fancy enough to feel all conceited about it.  They have some good (unlimited) chips with salsa or bean dip to eat before your meal, and they've got a solid menu full of very reasonably priced stuff.  On some of it you can tell they are cutting corners to save money, but I don't mind because they're passing the savings on to you by not charging too much.  For example, their Chili Relleno is wrapped in a scrambled egg instead of being batter-fried.  Or their fried ice-cream that's just covered in corn flakes instead of a true sweet-crumb batter.  But they still taste great and, like I said, it's cheap.  I ate there last night with my wife and it was $25 for the both of us.  Maybe $30 with the fried ice cream.  Also, they take reservations for large groups.  Sometimes I'll go there after a business meeting so I'll call ahead and get a large table for 12 in the back.  They're cool with that and the service is always great."}
{"text":"The food and service were fine. I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. It wasn't the \"best\" food I've had but it was really good food in a place that makes you want to linger a little longer and enjoy the time out."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Food wasn't the greatest either. There are a lot better Mexican restaurants on the area."}
{"text":"This has always been my absolute most favorite place to eat. I get the chicken chimichanga every single time I go here. Their beans and salsa are so good there as well."}
{"text":"I had lunch there on Monday afternoon and my overall impression was \"eh, ok.\" It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't good. I ordered the two combo platter with a bean tostado and a chicken taco with rice for my side. My boyfriend ordered a bean and cheese chimichanga. Nothing was spectacular, nothing stood out, everything could have benefited from the addition of salt and fresh herbs. I didn't have anything there that I couldn't make better myself and that's why I enjoy going out to eat - to have food I don't have at home. I had enough iceberg lettuce on my plate to make a salad. There was hardly any chicken. I would sum it up as \"bland\"."}
{"text":"Management is the problem. Staff seems to have hands tied and have no latitude.  Our server was great and extremely overworked.  Food was mediocre at best.  People waiting were allowed to wait next to tables being served.   Chaulk this up to the managers and poor planning.   Back to the one on Gilbert and Mckellips."}
{"text":"Every week we get an email from Serrano's offering a coupon with a fairly good deal. The last one we got was $2.00 off any regular priced combination meals of $8.99 or more. My husband ordered the Burro & cheese enchilada plate. I ordered the Serrano's Special Combination plate. When I presented the coupon to our server, she said the manager would NOT accept the coupon because it was to be used only with the combinations portion of the menu. It did not say that on the coupon! We have been loyal customers of Serrano's for years. I'm beginning to have second thoughts about going back"}
{"text":"Bleh! I can't believe this place has so many good reviews. The quality of the food is very poor (I think their appetizers come from the freezer section of the grocery store), anne the preparation is even worse- meat and beans have hardly any flavor, and the fried items are cold, limp, and greasy. You'd think that would be enough, but no- the menus, table, and silverware were dirty! I would've walked out, but it was someone's birthday. Service was mediocre. The only things positive were some of the decor and rooms to facilitate large parties."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Serrano's for years!  I rarely change my order, which is chicken burro enchilada style (red), rice only.  They offer complimentary chips, salasa, and hot BEAN DIP!  Its worth it alone to have the bean dip, never had it better anywhere else.  Luckily Serrano's is all over the valley, and if you're in a neighborhood for a period of time, you can count on Serrano's offering you their amazing dishes."}
{"text":"I try to avoid one star reviews but I had a pretty bad experience at this Serrano's in particular. My family and I went on a relatively quiet Thursday afternoon for dinner. It was moderately packed and were seated quickly. We put in our order and waited, and waited, and waited. We noticed it was strange that our server had been avoiding us but after an hour and half of no food we decided to ask what the hold up was. I understand mistakes happen and when they told us that our ticket was lost and that they would get out food out as quickly as possible, I couldn't believe it when it took another full 30 minutes before we even saw the manager let alone our food. When the manager did eventually come over all he mustered was a pathetic apology. I had small children, the least he could have done was rushed their food out but no. To make it worse, the server insisted I take a free shot of tequila. I had kids with me. When our food did finally arrive the plate was piping hot but my food was cold. We were neither rude, nor making a scene. I would much rather go to the other Serrano's before I come back here."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Food was blah. It had no flavor.  Both of us felt sick the next day, stomach cramps and more. Service was not good either, very hurried."}
{"text":"We had lunch there, Sunday at 2pm.  Such delicious food!  The salsa served with the fish left a lovely lingering flavor.  Seasoned just right.  Chicken quesadilla was huge and so succulent.  Every bite was a treat.  Ordered a lemonade with lime slice, very good.  Good service as well.  We moved here in January and this is our new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered an item straight off the menu. What came out was not what I ordered. The manager told me i ordered the wrong thing and brought the menu over to show me my error where he found i had ordered correctly for what i expected and i got tge wrong thing. He said he would fix it, which meant he would charge me for the cheaper item i received. Only belatedly, did he offer to correct the order, but by that point the other food was getting cold, so i just kept the wrong order. The food was medeocre, and expensive. The service was slow.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty terrible. I've had frozen Mexican food that tasted better than this place. Salsa was really strange and the guacamole tasted almost rancid. Beans and rice were salty and my enchilada tasted old. Overall I wasn't happy with it."}
{"text":"Good standby place, with good food. It's not a fancy place and it's not the best place ever but it's always good. Never had any problems here and it's not expensive either. I've spent a lot of time here over the years and there is a reason for that."}
{"text":"Some of my family really loves Serrano's, so I have been here at least a few times since I have been in Arizona.  I personally don't think it is the greatest Mexican food, but I can see how it is a great value. Their prices are pretty good and they do give you a lot of food. The chips and dip are excellent, but I haven't been able to find an entree that I thought was too impressive. Every time I have gone I have ordered something different and I will keep trying to find that awesome platter!  I think its an alright Mexican restaurant overall, but it doesn't excite me too much."}
{"text":"Horrible Mexican food!   I would recommend Tia Rosa or Nandos. I think it is just a cheap versions of better Mexican food that is close. Maybe their dinners are better but their lunch is plain, except the bean dip us good. I won't go back, I think it used to be better. I haven't heard anything good about their catering either.  I had a friend say it was soggy when it arrived. YUCK!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. If you LOVE onions & peppers than this is the place for you. There are peppers in the rice, chicken, and beef (but that's all my family got). Now onions & peppers- the bean dip is good but the big chunks of onions don't help your breath much either. The salsa is good but has anyone heard of knife or food processor? Again with the BIG chunks of tomatoes, onions, green onions, and green bell pepper.  My aunt ordered a chicken chimi and there wasn't much chicken but there was a lot of tomatoes, onions and peppers. These tomatoes were the whole tomatoes too but dang they were hard. The main item though our whole meal was peppers and onions. Especially eating your rice, I personally love rice and I HATE biting into a 4 inch long pepper strip thats running through my rice. I just hate fillers but honestly if you want to favor your food this isn't favoring by stuffing your items with 60% tomatoes, onions, peppers 40% chicken. You can just simply favor your food without the junk. Try Nando's Mexican restaurant there chicken chimi, it's all chicken- simply all chicken!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible but not as bad as the staff -- rude and complacent. It's basically a Latin inspired chuck-e-cheese! Do you're self a favor and go anywhere else! The management  is careless to complaints. Never going back ---"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Not something to die over, but your typical mexican food. I have been here multiple times over the last four years. The last three times I've been there the food was okay, but the service was beyond terrible! The busboy who brought us chips was rude. The waitress was not interested in serving us. Honestly this was the last chance for this restaurant the third time with terrible service was just enough to call it quits. I have talked to the manager about the awful service each time and he does not seem to be interested in fixing the problem. I'm not sure if the manager beats the employees before they go out to the table, but they are always in a terrible mood."}
{"text":"1st of all, best bean dip ever. You can get endless bowles of bead dip and salsa w/chips for just ordering a margarita.  After ordering the fajitas a few times, I switched to the pollo special on the specials menu. It comes with tortillas and happens to be a better flavor recipe than the fajitas.  The fried ice cream is delicious too.  Its a great place for groups and parties."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I highly suggest eating here if you are hungry for Mexican food. The portions are enormous. The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Our server Lynna was very nice. I think she was responsible for too many tables and rushing but still really nice.  In all honesty I'm going to keep this short because I don't want to be so bitter about an experience. I also do not want to offend anyone who honestly enjoys the food here.  Pros: courtesy chips salsa and beans  Cons: all of the food we ordered and paid for   Notes: the enchilada sauce was really salty  Maybe it's just not our cup of tea or maybe we've been spoiled with better home cooked Mexican fare. At any rate I can't say I would come back for the food at a total of $48+ it definitely was not worth it. Feeling remorse."}
{"text":"Read some reviews before coming here so I knew it would be hit or miss. The experience wasn't amazing but I wasn't disappointed.  My meal consisted of a bean tostada, cheese enchilada, and a beef taco. I don't remember what the the combo was called but I was having a hard time making up my mind and figured some variety would be nice. The taco was good, the beef was shredded and a had a lot of black pepper. The cheese enchilada was good but I prefer my enchiladas real saucy. I didn't finish the tostada because I didn't really like the shell.  The kids got chicken fingers with fries and said the fries were no good. I think there were only three little chicken fingers in the meal.  The best part of the meal was the waitress. She let us know about a promotion that is going on where you go online, get the phrase of the day, say it and you get a free food item. The day we went it was flautas and we each got a free one. We ordered two beef and one chicken. They were good. The food item changes daily.  I may or may not be back. With all of the Mexican food choices around here I will probably choose an establishment that I haven't yet tried."}
{"text":"Agree this is the best of the Serrano's locations, and that the Val Vista and guadelupe location is the worst.  The bean dip is always warm and tasty, chips almost always hot and salted reasonably.  For the last 5 years the chicken tortilla soup and albondigas have never, ever been less than superb.  In terms of food, service, ambience this is really 3 stars, but for being so damn consistent over the years gotta give this one a 4."}
{"text":"As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the service is terribly slow.  The decor was very nice.  But the food was good.  I got the combo plate.  The enchiladas were tasty but the flautas were very dry.   Nice warm bean dip and salsa with the chips.  Not my favorite Mexican restaurant, but worth a second try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. I really had a good time. I just went for lunch. The staff was so considerate and helpful I absolutely recommend"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it a one star is because I have to give it something. We waited for over an hour even though there was an table open that would have accommodated us. They seated and served all the people that came in after and we were pretty much forgotten. After speaking to the manager he didn't even offer us anything for our dinner being ruined. I took my family there as a special occasion and having such a bad experience pretty much ruined our time. We literally had to hurry and eat fast to get the smaller children home. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the BEST Mexican food I've had in Arizona !! This place is absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Greasy, salty, gringo \"mexican\"  food at gringo prices.  No bueno. No gracias."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service I love them!!' Will definitely return:) a little expensive but worth it"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, it's an attractive building and the staff are pleasant. But the food is lame and the service is slow. We had margaritas, ribeye, albondigas soup, fresca fish, taco salad, and quesadilla. The salad and steak were OK, but the other dishes were very disappointing. Bland and dull. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"The. BEST SALSA AND BEAN DIP IN THE WORLD NEED I SAY MORE!!! But seriously ok I've been coming here all my life to multiple Serrano's across Arizona and I have to say this is my favorite Mexican place hands down. I haven't changed my order once in over 14 years and I don't regret it one bit. I always get the 2 item with two soft flour tacos with shredded beef and rice and beans. Servers became close family friends over the years and honestly became apart of a routine! Great all around highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is always great flavor is all over the place atmosphere is cam and compatible to other Mexican food places now when it comes to service they have a severe fault. Here is my issue sat down and dropped my napkin kindly asked for a new one when the server came to drop off our order after waiting for a long period well I got halfway thru my meal I grabbed a set of silverware from another table so I had a napkin. And to add a bit more sting to my visit I had drank both mine and my mother's water waiting for a refill on my water cup never saw anyone even walk by in the 15 min I was sitting looking for a refill never ever coming or recommending this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner with my wife here at the Power Road location. We had the chicken burrito and the pork taco platters. They constantly checked up on us, Fantastic!!! Combine this with endless chips, iced tea and the kind of service you only dream about, its our go-to mexican food restaurant!!! Ask for Katelyn......"}
{"text":"I would only give Serranos one star but since they have won me over from their other location I'm obligated to be generous.  They closed one of our favorite locations on Val Vista so we decided to drive further to another Serranos, big mistake.  It was a Monday night, quiet, not a lot going on just a simple weekday night. Upon arriving we were seated and immediately placed our drink order(tea, water, soda). We were happy and excited and anxiously awaiting our chips and beans. It's took about 10 minutes and our chips came and we placed our order. (2 kids meals and 2 adult plates)  Then we waited and waited and waited and waited we were told twice our food is almost ready. Finally after 45 minutes after ordering, over an hour of being seated we requested our food be boxed to go. And then received an apology that an order in front of us had to be remade and would we like to talk to manager. We smiled, said no, gave our 15%tip and then got in our car and decided we are no longer going back.  Serranos it seems our relationship has drifted apart and we no longer have the love we once had, best of wishes!  -goodbye"}
{"text":"What a joke. For some reason we were sat in the bar, restaurant not busy...but ok.  Waited exactly 17 minutes before acknowledged.  Bartender walked by us 3 times, which was our server. She had 2 tables occupied and 3 people at the bar hmm...finally came by. Forgot my drink...forgot our silverware and my my food was cold? Bad experience.  Would never go back. Been in the service industry for 22 years. Have some pride in your job."}
{"text":"First time here and the staff was awesome.  The food is just...eh...but the server did an awesome job at keeping our drink replenished and being around without being around too much."}
{"text":"Nice option for chain Mexican food.  Nothing to get super excited about but not bad either.  We will keep coming here whenever we want a nice Mexican meal because there aren't many Mexican places that are better than this in the area..."}
{"text":"Been going here for 15 years and still loving it.  Service is good and food never disappoints.  The family hasn't changed anything in all the years we have going here and that's a good thing!  Love the Serrano's special quesadilla with pork!"}
{"text":"I love this place. How can you not crave the bean dip everyday. You know what your are getting here and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Putting my Mexican restaurant rule to the test, I promised my self I would not judge this place , or any place, until the chips and salsa came out. My rule is (and it almost NEVER fails me) if the chips and salsa aren't good, the food won't be good. Stale, store-bought chips= entrees made with canned, processed ingredients- not fresh ones. Flavorless, ketchup-like salsa= flavorless food you would be better off buying pre-made at the grocery store. Try it out, it works!  After being served our chips and salsa and taking my first eager bite, my conclusion was: Not bad. Not amazing, but not bad. In fact, I only visited this place a week ago and I hardly even rememeber it. That's the kind of impression it made on me. I ordered the Machaca which I usually love, but this seemed to be lacking the flavor and texture I was looking for. The rice and beans aren't bad, but again, not amazing.   I would recommend this place to people afraid of Mexican food- those that rarely eat it and never venture far away from a ground beef taco. However, if you are like myself and could eat Mexican food all day every day, I would recommend you skip this place and look for the nearest run-down, mom & pop, been-around-for-50-years, Nana still in the kitchen, local kind of place."}
{"text":"We have always gone to the Serrano's restaurants for years including there breakfast place Beunchies  where we have enjoyed many many many Meals  with family, this is until we met Sara who works in the bar at Power Rd Serrano's. I could go on and on about the absence  of personal service that I noticed as she was training a young man who simply couldn't stay off his phone. Not talking however constantly peeking as if we're main priority. We observed a man in his probably late 70s approach the bar area after his meal and happily asked for  a toothpick. Without hesitation Sara explained there was no tooth picks at bar and waived him off.. this was after this elderly gentleman had gave the young apprentice some encouragement and some banter in this same area. My heart sank at the sad display of humanity and explained the situation to Sara as an outsider. My goodness she would not have it.. The first question she asked me was how do you know he was a veteran with a snarky laugh\" because of his tee shirt she asked.\" She then proceeded to question me and dispute my account. I felt bullied as she stated I'm offended you would bring that up as the whole restaurant stared at the situation:: as the manager arrived after 5 minutes of back and forth which I clearly stated several times I wanted to agree to disagree/. Sara wouldn't have it. I am confident anyone reading this post who knows get will agree she can't let anything go. I felt threatened by Sara in the bar area and will NEVER go t to Serranos family restaurants again as I have at a minimum of once a week for ten years and will tell everyone I know in the business Church and personal circles of there practice of allowing.. people who do not hold the standards high for Seniors Veterans or all human beings alike to a safe and comfortable standard:. By the way I did not accept any compensation from the manager who had to pull Sara away from being completely overwhelming to me and my wife and gave her a 22 percent tip.. I figured her for the last after 100s of visits and Sara managed to turn our stomachs she deserved it.. Sara you made our night out just as disgusting as could be. Good luck and hope someday you find a sense of compassion for humanity.... enjoy the 8.00 tip!!!!  FYI Serrano's family this is just a start as I am completely disgusted here...."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was outstanding!  They really made sure that all of my needs were met.  If you get the opportunity to sit in Beth's section, you are in for some 5 star treatment!  10/10 would recommend and come again"}
{"text":"I had the steak burrito.  This is traditional Mexican versus the lighter and healthier CaMex - re-fried, heavy on cheese, very few greens.  The table chips and salsa includes re-fried beans.  Very friendly and courteous staff.  Seated promptly, food came out quick and hot, and no eating for refill of ice tea and check delivered promptly.  That is a lot of pluses on the service side.  4 stars if the burrito came heavier in greens and lighter on cheese and refried."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp while running errands. Everything was great with great service. I had a combination plate with an enchilada and taco it was great. My wife had a fish plate that tasted great...yeah I had to try it.  Also ask for the really hot salsa for your chips! We will most certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"This is our most favorite restaurant. In the last two months we have gone out to eat more often than usual do (we are retired and do have to watch the budget) in the fact that we have gone out three or four times. We always ask to be seated in Angela's seating area as she knows what we want without even having to look at the menu. She will tell us if there is something we may be interested in, otherwise, she remembers what our usual orders are. Both of us find that looking at the menu is not necessary thanks to her unique and special service. She makes us WANT to go out for a meal. I can not say that there is any place that actually makes us really look forward to scheduling a meal out. We get great service with Angela, the food has always be very good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I want start this review off by saying that I think Serranos has great Mexican food and is one of my favorites in AZ.   Today's review is based off the lack of customer service at the Power Road location. I should have looked at the low rating before going in.  I ordered the burro and enchilada combo meal and asked the server if it was possible to switch the enchilada to a taco. She said unfortunately there aren't any substitutions and pointed to it on the menu. I felt like a child asking the wrong question. She said though that she would check with her manager and let me know.   Here comes the manager B, and he explained to me that there are no substitutions and unfortunately that's the way it is. I explained to him that the other locations switch it all the time. He then explained to me that they should not be doing that and that there are no substitutions.   He said If I wanted to pay extra he would make the change otherwise there are no substitutions. Once again I felt like a kid being talked down to.  I am not sure what power trip he was on but as a  manager of a Mexican restaurant I believe customer service is key.  What the manager accomplished was for a loyal customer to get online and rate the place poorly for customer service and never visit this location again.  Hopefully the owners can teach him the importance of good customer service and sometimes being able to be flexible to work with customers requests."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location at Serranos. Their customer service is amazing. The layout of this restaurant is very unique and gives you many options of tables to sit at depending on how you feel. I am obsessed with the chips they deliver at the beginning of your meal. The chips come with salsa and bean dip which are to die for! Their margaritas are amazing and you can not come here without trying one! I have yet to try an item on the menu I do not like!"}
{"text":"This place gets the job done. It's not the best mexican food I tasted but it's still very tasty. The servers were good and I liked that they brought out salsa and bean dip. Their portions are big. I actually got albondiga soup but tasted other dishes on the table. Everything was good and we left satisfied."}
{"text":"Loved the food!  Great meatball soup and kids portions were big!  We were a large party and they accommodated us quickly and served all our food at once. Awesome margaritas too. Whole family of 20 was happy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Serrano's with our friends who live in  the area at their suggestion. Wow! Everything was great from start to finish. The facility itself was clean and tastefully decorated (Hey! Presentation is everything, right???), the hostess was friendly, the wait staff attentive and diligent about keeping our drinks topped off and the chips and salsa coming without having to ask even once for a refill.    OMG!!! The salsa was about the best I've ever tasted anywhere - so fresh and with just the right amount of hot that got its \"giddyup\" from actual CHILI peppers, NOT black pepper. Others said the bean dip was good too, but I detest beans so you'll have to take their word on it. Everyone enjoyed their meals and overate because it was so tasty despite filling up on the chips and salsa. My husband had the soft taco plate and gave it a rating of 9 which says a lot because he is TOUGH! I had the grilled chicken quesadilla which was HUGE and loaded with gooey, melty cheese. Oh so good...   Okay, Serrano's, when are ya comin' to West Valley???"}
{"text":"I ended up here the other night after an evening art class.  I was starving as I had been crafting all afternoon/evening and had just managed to spend $60 on more art supplies.    The bean dip that is served with salsa and chips is awesome.  I am not a huge bean person, but it was good- I had to stop myself from eating it so I would be able to eat my dinner.  I love extra treats like that!  I had the spinach enchiladas which were above average.  I ordered them just with rice which was also pretty good.  My margarita was on the okay side, nothing spectacular.    Our server was random- he was great at the beginning and progressively got worse.  Then, at one point, someone asked for some pico de gallo.  The bill came and we had to pay $2.25 for the pico.  Seriously?  You give us bean dip with salsa at the start at no charge but randomly charge for pico?  I find this ridiculous and irritating.  If I happen to find myself in Mesa and dying for some Mexican, I may go again, but I'm not sure I would because it was just an okay experience."}
{"text":"They have a cantina/bar. If you go to there and order a beer or two without having a meal the manager doesnt look at it favorable. He makes you feel uncomfortable. I guess thats why the bar in the cantina is always empty when i arrive. Why have a bar in the restaurant if its discouraged to have a beer or two?"}
{"text":"Great food, but the bar staff could be replaced by a warm washcloth and no one would notice.  I don't expect much more than polite and nice, they haven't achieved that yet"}
{"text":"I have eaten in the Serrano's in QC and really enjoyed the food. So I decided to give the menudo at this location a try. Well, not only was the bowl small, the store bought flour tortillas they served were dried out. Steer clear of the menudo and give something else on the menu a try."}
{"text":"We always sit in Fabiola's area she is very nice and does a great job!!! The food is always tasty. We like the salsa that they give you with the chips. Always good food and service ."}
{"text":"i just left serrano's with an order of albondigas soup to-go which is supposed to include tortillas but much to my surprise there were no tortillas.. i called to complain and patty, the bartender said i'll let you talk to the manager... next thing that happened.. they hung up on me... wtf.  i have been going there for many years but stopped when they kept raising the prices of margo's,, now at $6 during hh... and now they are screwing you over with to-go food by leaving out items that are supposed to be included... cheap cheap cheap !!  serrano's, can you get any frigging cheaper ??? and stop screwing over those who order food to-go.. i know you think if they leave without items you win by not giving them a full order...  so should i go back ?? if i do i will forget to tip..  just like patty said \"we forgot\" i'll forget to tip in the future.."}
{"text":"If you like cold food with hair in it then this place is for you. The tacos were substandard at best, cold in the center and tasted funny. Halfway through the meal my wife found a long hair in her tamale. The manager tried to  play it off by saying it was silk from the corn... but I know a hair when I see one. We definitely won't be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I understand that it's Cinco De Mayo and wait wasn't horrible (35 mins)but ordering food and waiting over an hour for it is inexcusible. Wife and I got tired and waiting and walked out. No respectable service. No wait staff apology no let me see what's taking so long. Basically felt like staff didn't care and trying to turn tables and I know we weren't the only ones who walked out. Never had had trouble before here but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Let me just preface this review by saying that I am so sad that they closed down their location on Val Vista. I am not a huge fan of where their Power location is (the parking lot is terrible) but that will not stop me from going here. I know they have other locations, but this is the one that is closest to where my family lives. I have enjoyed my experiences at all locations though.   This is definitely one of my Top 10 favorite restaurants ever! My family and I come here to celebrate everything from birthdays to wedding engagements, and just random nights when we are craving delicious Mexican food.  The food is authentic, delicious, and always fresh! The bean dip and salsa they give you to snack on while you are waiting for your food are to die for! I seriously could drink the bean dip by the bucket. I love their chimichangas the most but everything that I have ever gotten has been delicious. The guacamole is delicious and fresh! All of their food is full of flavor as well. The portions are rather large, plus we usually overdo it on the salsa and bean dip before I food arrives so I always end up taking my leftovers home. They are even good reheated the next day.   The service here is great and they are always so happy and friendly!! They are so great at checking cups and making sure that everyone's glass is full. I always feel like I am friends with the servers after leaving.   The whole restaurant is decorated appropriately and I love the atmosphere that it creates as well.  We have also had them cater a couple of events for us and the food was just as good there!! They were easy to work with, the food showed up hot, fresh, and delicious!!  (Side note: I live in Idaho currently so I only get Serranos when I am back in Arizona visiting family. This is rather unfortunate especially in this moment as I am writing this review because I am seriously craving anything from here!)"}
{"text":"Waiting on a table standing there and I said that table in the bar is clean now so the Manager if you wanna call him that, ask if we were next in line to the hostess.No we were just standing there for 10 minutes and our name for 4 people was next. The other party had 8-10 people in their party. All this Manager had  to do is look at the check- in book. How ignorant you gotta be to realize 8 to 10 people won't fit in  tiny booth? That Manager asked the young girl and she was like yes, but I think he didn't believe her and said go ahead as he tried to hide his lips with his hand. Hello I can hear you. This guy is not a people person. Never smiles and comes off as a jerk."}
{"text":"I got the chimi, not bad, nice that it comes with sour cream and guacamole. Unbelievably, some Mexican restaurants here don't give you that. Sylvia is very nice waitress. Although, she isn't mine, she helping my waitress., who I haven't even gotten her name yet.pretty good iced tea and I love iced tea! Salsa is good. I like Garcia's salsa better, but still this one not bad at all. Ok, my waitress is Fabiola. She's not real smiley, but doing an efficient job.  I'm here at 12:51pm and overall it has been a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience tonight. The bean dip was cold and below room temperature it seemed. I got my soft taco with meat and cheese only , only for it to be a loaded taco. Then when we got our ticket the reduced a drink off I thought. Nope , came back and fixed the check and charged me for the drink even though niether me or my significant other at our meals. So $20 down the drain to a \"local\" establishment that's customer service is garbage. Won't be back again , sad that our family ordered $150 worth of food from them for our family reunion. What a waste. Wow. Also for the drink they recharged me for , the server never refilled once. So $2.50 or whatever for a drink I couldn't even get a refill on. COME ON!"}
{"text":"The food is good, reasonably priced and usually comes out very fast. There was only one time that we had to wait a little bit longer than we would have liked to get our order, but to be fair, it was super busy at the time."}
{"text":"I've been coming to serranos for years. Always enjoyed it. Unfortunately they really let us down tonight. We ordered our food and it took over a half hour for it to come, when it did it was luke warm, the cheese in my bean burrito wasn't even melted. My husbands quesadilla was soggy and when it arrived didn't have the sour cream that comes with it. After informing them they said they'd bring it right away. They didn't, not wanting it to get any colder he started eating and was half way done before I finally got up and went to the front desk and informed the manager that we weren't being served and hadn't seen our waitress in a long time. We maybe saw her 4 times and two of those were at the end of our meal for the check. Aside from making the workers bring the things we needed the manager never even came back to be sure we were satisfied. I can see why we got such good poor service if management doesn't even demonstrating it. All in all we probably won't be back, pretty much ruined our family Friday night."}
{"text":"My sister and I were ending our mother/daughter day and decided to stop here for dinner... Bad mistake!!!!!! This was a Thurs. night and was not crowded at all...we waited 15 minutes to be seated. The young ladies hosting didn't have any restaurant educate...Didn't look like either one of the brushed their hair for work! we placed our order... meanwhile a party of probably 14 sat next to us and from there on received all of the attention...25 minutes later the waitress finally came around to tell us our food would be up soon...After 45 minutes of being there and not having our food served yet we decided to talk to the manager... Her explanation was everyone came  in at once... We asked her if she could find our waitress and bill us for the drinks we ordered...she did and allowed us to leave without our dinner...Very poor manager customer service Never again!!!! nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Any time we are in the Mesa area my wife and I like to stop by one of these places. My wife loves the bean dip that they give out with their chips and salsa. Tonight I had a machaca beef chimichanga, my wife had a taco salad and my dad and cheese enchiladas. While the chimichanga was good, it lacked some meat. I felt like I was eating mostly the tortilla, sour cream and guacamole. I love both of those so it wasn't terrible but it really could have used a injection of the meat that was supposed to be in it. The rice is pretty good and the beans are so so."}
{"text":"Great food, service started out a little slow but got great as the dining experience continued. Will definitely go back when I'm in that area."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after I got off work to enjoy lunch. We have driven by this location many times before on our way to work and after work. The restaurant is set up in Adobe style architecture with beautiful, large Mexican pottery throughout and large decorative balls inside clear glass vases. The booths are comfortable and roomy. The restrooms are clean. The parking lot is roomy. There is outdoor patio seating overlooking a nice, green golf course with Resort living. We were greeted by a nice hostess and led to a comfortable booth. Our waitress came over and asked what we would like to drink. A friendly lady brought chips, fresh salsa and hot refried beans to our table. We ordered the lunch specials. Every day of the week, the restaurant has a specific lunch special in addition to their lunch special menu. Today (Thursday), the special was guacamole tostada and a cheese enchilada, and it also included a drink. My husband ordered it and I ordered off their regular lunch menu the cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  We didn't have to wait long before our food was brought out to our table. It was fresh, hot and delicious. The cheese on the enchilada was melted and plentiful. The sauce was really good, mild and not overly spicy. My husband's tostada was large and loaded with guacamole. Everything was very filling.  On the way out, they have their fresh made from scratch flour tortillas and hot sauce for sale. They have toothpicks and two kinds of peppermint candy: chocolate and regular. They have another location as well besides this location on Power Road. If you're looking for a new restaurant to try...give these nice folks a visit--you will be happy with your service and food."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The is food is okay. But the service is far below par. We sat down and waited... and waited... and waited. 45 min with no food goes by so I ask... the waitress says our food should be out any minute. An hour goes by. An hour and 10 min. Finally we have somewhere we need to be so we need to leave. I ask a different waitress what's going on. When she comes back she says \"oh I guess your order never got put in... you can go ahead and go. Sorry.\" Not can I do anything else for you... I don't know what happened... what can I do to make this right... nothing. So we left... Still hungry. I won't be coming back after going here many years. Sucks to see a good place go down hill with such poor service."}
{"text":"I live in Miami and we really don't have very good Mexican food here... There are a few but not really great. Mesa has something like 240 Mexican restaurants and all of them are really authentic. My favorite is Serrano's...Mesa...a lot of fun. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to have lunch here today. I must say I was pleased. I ordered the shredded beef chimi . It was loaded with meat and the service was awesome. This place has been here for many years. Now I see why. Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Let me start with he bean dip. It was warm, and that was a plus. I had a green beef burrito, but really expected green chili on the burrito, didn't get it. I was a good family place and I would go back, but only if I am in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is a solid 4 stars, the service sucks.  This is the type of restaurant where you have to hunt down your server to pay your bill 37 minutes after she left it at your table(which is my biggest pet peeve). Don't try to pay it up front either, they'll send you back to your booth to wait for your server to take care of it. DEFINITELY don't try to sub out the flour tortilla for a corn tortilla, apparently they don't do that either..  Keep the cook, replace the serving staff, give me my corn tortillas & I'll come back. Maybe.."}
{"text":"All of our food had a hint of Italian seasoning, which was strange and unappealing.  The veggie enchilada is chock full of zucchini (the menu just said veggie, and I had anticipated the usual peppers and onions...if you love zucchini, get the veggie enchilada and a side of Mexican veggies - also just zucchini - unfortunately I really don't like zucchini!).  All around the place is nice, service was friendly, but the food just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Jon here was such a sweetheart and provided wonderful service to my date and I. We will definitely be returning. Smiles and great food all around."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. The food was decent, something not the same in the taste from the other locales I've had. I think it had something to the taste being a lil bland, not very seasoned on my carnitas Chimi.  But the service for the most part was good, and we were approached by the manager so it was a nice overall friendly environment."}
{"text":"A good, solid Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the halibut fillet dinner on a Sunday night.  The chips were a wee-bit stale and the salsa and bean dip was ok.  The only Mexican beer on tap (Dos Equis amber) was gone already :(  and it took a while for the waitress to get me a bottle of it.  I had asked for water with lime...but the lime came with the beer instead.  It took a while for dinner to be served too.  The place was not overly busy.  The Mexican vegetable mix was chopped mash overcooked.  Not an impressive meal.  The manager was good, stopping by each table to see if everything was ok.  I might return...maybe."}
{"text":"The place seemed extremely over staff although our waitress seemed to ignore our table once served my tostada was completely soggy unedible the waitress acted like it was my fault. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I used to love the food here. Haven't been here in a few years. Tonight the food was awful. Cheese enchilada was chewy and no cheese inside. Basically a tortilla with cheese on top. Flavorless beans, margarita that was literally ALL sweet and sour. I barely touched my food. A waste of money and calories. I won't be back. Servers were nice and attentive and the salsa was still good so the reason for the two stars."}
{"text":"Service was good. Loved the bean dip served with the salsa. Was NOT impressed with the baked chips or the almost raw bell pepper loaded $15.00 Shrimp Fajita. Was more impressed with the ham burger than the Southwest servings. There are a lot of southwestern places here and this one just doesn't serve the quality of food for a higher rating. Unless you are on the small side, you will wish you had asked for a table. The booths are small and I mean small."}
{"text":"I have lived in AZ my whole life and grew up eating at Serrano's. I read many of the reviews saying how horrible the service is.... not the case. We just went on a busy Friday night and had phenomenal fajitas! The service was amazing!  Our server Luis never let our drinks go dry and visited the table several times. The bus boy was all over the chips and salsa/bean dip. The manager was working the room the entire time visiting all of the tables. Any I've eaten there since a child and plan to continue!"}
{"text":"I find it amazing that the separation of only 110 miles between Tucson and Phoenix causes the difference between the mexican food to be so drastic. This place isn't bad so let me first say that. But it is so far from the Mexican food in Tucson that I kinda felt disappointed. I felt like being in Arizona the Mex food would be equal but it sure isn't I enjoyed my food and had my Mexican fix but it wasn't nearly as good as I assumed it would be. I think next time I'll stay away from the Machaca and get some enchiladas or something."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience here and will never go back ordered 2 tacos and my daughter ordered 2 enchiladas and my son  who loves nachos got a plate of nachos. he took 2 bites and left the rest. The food was awful and the sour cream tasted bad but when we told the waitress she said they put a ranch seasoning mix I  it.. Who does that? The nacho chips were burnt and the tacos and enchiladas were 5.49 a piece!! Who charges that much for those items Ala carte?? It was not on the menu but never dreamed it would cost that much. I talked to the manager and he had really nothing to say. We are just one out of many who may dine here so it doesn't matter. I wish them well and am trying to be forgiving but to pay 50.00 for lunch that was Ala carte and horrible is Ludacris. Too many other Mexican  food restraunts out there that are better and  cheaper then this!"}
{"text":"Very nice environment with good service and  good food. The ranch/guacamole salad dressing is very good, salad was large an crisp."}
{"text":"I like this one the best out of all of them. My first ever Serrano's where I fell in love with the bean dip thing they serve.  The service here is great, and they are way friendly and I would highly recommend this one to anyone!  I like the Machaca chimi more then any other food they serve!!!"}
{"text":"We are new residents here in Mesa and several people recommended Serrano's.  We were glad we tried it.  This will be a go to place! The food was great and we loved the bean dip!"}
{"text":"We ate here over the weekend while visiting AZ for a wedding.  I don't like spicy food and don't know what \"good Mexican\" food is so I don't have much background, but here goes:  The chips, salsa, and bean dip are very good, especially the bean dip.  They all keep coming to the table as fast as you can eat them - always a PLUS.  We went on a Friday and the MARG special was prickly pear.  It was so so tasty, although I don't think there was much alcohol in it at all.  I asked for a carnitas enchilada and my 4 friends and I waited for quite some time for our food so we were stuffed from the chips, salsa, and bean dip.  When my food finally came it was basically an overcooked, cubed pork chop in a burrito - dry and yucky!"}
{"text":"Worst Serranos location. Will never go back. Horrible service, cold food, and terrible customer service by the management.   Took over an hour to get our food. Food came out cold, some of it was luke warm, but most was cold. The server argued that it couldn't be cold and walked away. Manager came over and said we are taking care of your meal and walked away. Didnt even offer to fix it. The six of us would have preferred to pay for a hot meal. We sat at the table for another hour eating and waiting for any acknowledgment and got none.   There are plenty of other much better restaurants out there. I suggest that you try another location or another resaurant all together. Serranos is not worth it to me anymore. They have been going downhill for years."}
{"text":"Had not been here in years now I remember why!!! Parking is a nightmare very tight , the food was so so , not something I'm willing to go back and try again.  To me they are a little pricey for what they offer"}
{"text":"We used to really enjoy coming here. However, our last 3 visits have been less than pleasant.  Last night, we had a table for 10. We understand that it is a larger table and therefore may take longer to be served. The waitress cane out with the chips and salsa and took our drink orders. The drinks came out pretty quick and she was on task for refills. We placed our food order and then waited for an hour. Several larger tables that were seated after us were served long before we were.  The manager did come out and offered a credit for a portion of the bill. Had this been the first time, we would not complain. However this has been the third time in the past 6 months that service was slow, at least this time the waitress wasn't rude or argumentative."}
{"text":"When I lived in Gilbert I always went to the original in downtown chandler. Tried this location on for size and was not disappointed. The good was wonderful as always. One of my favorite Mexican places."}
{"text":"My experience was at the bar. The bartender Sara, is really really rude and she should be fired! She has treated us like this before, but we've given her chance after chance. But I just can't take it anymore. She is very rude and cold. We walked up to the bar, and she immediately told us that she can't help us for a few minutes. So we were OK with it, until we saw her just walking around the restaurant doing absolutely nothing. And then she would walk back to the bar and help everybody else at the bar, and then ignore us the entire time we sat there. Finally, I gave her a dirty look, and she came over to us but never said Hi or anything, just straight out asked us what we wanted. She then told us very coldly in a cold voice that we have to pay her before we leave the bar. I don't know what the hell that's about, we have never skipped out on a bill yet, and we don't plan to anytime soon. She is really really a freaking joke. Like I said, every time we sit at the bar she treats us like CRAP. And I'm not having it anymore. I can take my business somewhere else were we will be treated with RESPECT!"}
{"text":"Loved the location on Val Vista but they closed it.  Had not been to this one on Power Rd for over a year.  It used to be good but has gone downhill.  I had the shrimp combo fajitas and my wife had the shredded beef taco salad.  First, the bean dip was so runny and tasteless.  The salsa was loaded with more cilantro than anything else.  I had my fajitas with flour tortillas which came out cold.  I was suppose to get shrimp and streak in my combo.  I received 5 stripes of streak that were less than 3\" long and 1/4\" wide.  I did get around 10 shrimp but to my surprise, they were bay shrimp.  The smallest you can get.  Onions and green peppers were under cooked.  Wife's taco salad was alright without a lot of flavor in the shredded beef.  Our waitress was pleasant but never came back after she delivered the dinners.  Did not check on how we were enjoying the dinners or even to see if we wanted more sodas.  Just asked if we wanted dessert as she dropped off the check.  I know she was not that busy as we had a few empty tables in her section and no large groups.  Serrano's used to be a great place to have good Mexican food with great service.  At least at the Power Rd location that is not the case anymore.  Too many better Mexican restaurants around East Mesa to waste time on this one."}
{"text":"Right to the point. This is not only the worst \"Mexican\" food that I've ever had, but it is likely in the top three worst of all-time of any type of restaurant food I've ever tried to consume.  I had steak and shrimp fajitas. The shrimp were very dried out with nearly no flavor. The \"steak\" was indistinguishable as any type of meat of which I'm familiar. Please excuse the following... I had to immediately spit the food out in to a napkin.   I didn't bother complaining and paid the bill. I would not return if they offered free meals for life.   On a lighter note, the general feel of the restaurant was nice and the staff seemed cordial.   I usually don't have this type of experience with restaurants. There are times when food might not be quite to my taste, but this was not about typical issues that can arise. This food was very bad.   I sure hope other people have better experience with their selections.  If you are trying to decide between this place and somewhere else, I recommend the latter."}
{"text":"Normally this place is pretty good. My last couple experiences have been horrible. The idiot server dropped my drink all over me while breaking the glass on the table. Then it took 40minutes to get out food, and it wasn't very busy. Once we got out food I ordered a chicken burro with green sauce, I got a beef with red sauce. I told the lovely waitress and I got the response no thats what you ordered. Rude."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, this was our first stop for lunch.  After traveling for 12 hours, we were hungry, and that may have skewed my appreciation for the food.  The overall feeling at our table was that the food was mediocre.  We got what we ordered, they honored the special requests that one in our group made, but it didn't leave me wanting more or needing to go back.  The service was friendly but not terribly attentive.  I asked for extra napkins which came at the end of our meal, along with the extra salsa I requested."}
{"text":"I believe the quality of food has gone down hill almost seems like they pre-perp their foods."}
{"text":"I grew up on Serrano's and used to love their food. That being said...... Hubby and I ate at the Power and Southern location in Mesa this past Wednesday. The food was TERRIBLE and so was the service. We both got the chimichanga plate, one pork and one red chile beef with¬†enchilada style. The food was bland and tasted old and nasty. The chimichangas were not really fried either. Server was just this side of rude, never returned to the table until we were pretty much ready to go, and never provided a receipt other than the store copy. Over all HORRIBLE experience. Waste of $ 30 some odd dollars. Never again."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not a lot of variety. However the service is amazing, you never have to ask for a refill on anything and you never have time to wonder where your server is because they come to your table and repeatedly check on you. Not in the annoying way but in the customer service way. My husband and I have been going here for years and would recommend it to anyone seeking a new restaurant or anyone wanting a nice quiet evening out.  Great place for kids and big parties as well. Larger parties are also placed in the back as to not interrupt other diners and for more privacy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and fresh. I brought my girls to this restaurant last month and it was amazing vthe chips and beans were delicious, the salsa fresh and tasty, and the food piping hot and delicious. I even had enough to bring home for leftovers. I don't live close by, but I'll be coming by any time I can!"}
{"text":"A great thing about Serranos is how quick the food and drinks come out! This tends to be a spot we go to on Friday nights! They have a great house margarita!As soon as you sit down you are greeted with chips, salsa, and bean dip! (all very good) Then you order and bam your food is ready within 20 minutes hot and fresh. We've tried several things here tacos, burritos,chimichangas, fajitas, and enchiladas. The only thing I didnt like was the fajitas. They were overcooked and the meat was chewy! The only downside to this place is that when the snowbirds are in town its impossible to get a table before 8 pm."}
{"text":"My daughter loved her cheese enchilada, rice and beans for lunch.  I loved the rice, the beans were good but the green chili burrito tasted wayyyyyyyy too salty and the beef tasted like it was canned beef  The service was fabulous as we were never without a full drink, chips, salsa, or bean dip and even requested a spicier sauce for the chips and that was fantastic!! .  I would go back but would not order the green chili burrito."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for dinner at Serrano's tonight, and both of us ordered the chimichanga with seasoned beef. Our dinners came with beans, rice, sour cream and guacamole. The food was brought to us piping hot. Serrano's has great food, service, and atmosphere. We'll definitely make a return visit."}
{"text":"Went here because of the beautiful building and positive reviews... We were disappointed to say the least. Soggy chimichanga, mushy rice, bland machaca and chicken, chips that tasted like supermarket chips, and mediocre salsa."}
{"text":"I gave it a four because everything I have tried from them was good. Not the BEST Mexican restaurant I have ever tried but definitely one I would go back to on a regular basis (especially since it's close.) I really like that they give you bean dip with your chips! They also have some great desserts."}
{"text":"First off I'll start by saying their food is amazing, I love eating here. The problem is the service, it's awful. Since the one on ValVista closed I have to go to this one. They need help, I'm not sure why they haven't hired any more wait staff. I have ate here maybe 10 times in the past 4/5 months and have only received good service once. It's sad because their food is amazing. Hopefully they can get it together. I was just there for lunch today and I was in there for 1.5 hours. Not by choice..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! The Mexican vegetables are amazingly good. The service is fantastic. We didn't wait long even for having 10 people on a busy Saturday night. We loved this place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Screaming screeching children that the management said was just fine. Our really nice waitress said some nights it's like daycare in there.  Several of the tables around us left with their food in a carry out just like we did. The food is pretty average.... a shame for the wait staff who are really nice except the manager who was snide  The name of the rude manager is Jill ...I hope the owner sees this. I have never written a bad review but this experience was beyond the pale."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was comfortable.  I enjoyed eating at Serrano's.  The bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent!  I had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave my experience 2 stars is because the food was awesome... Beyond that, my experience was not so great. My friend and I were seated right away, but getting our drinks took forever. Once we had ordered, again our food took a loooong time to get to the table. Our server came and checked on us maybe once, and that was after we flagged her down. On top of the annoyingly slow service, our table was sticky :/  All in all, great food, horrible service."}
{"text":"Chips & Salsa: mmm mmm mmm! It was pretty fantastic, and the fact that we got a bean deep with it was a very nice surprise! The salsa was some of the best salsa I have had with a good amount of kick but certainly nothing overwhelming!  Service: Friendly, a good amount of checking in and recommendations on the menu. The first time I visited our waitress was a treat, second time our waitress was fine... but both times a manager stopped over to check in on us. I just felt very taken care of at the Family Restaurant!   Food: I've had the same things both times! I wish I could remember what it was actually called but it is 2 enchilada type things (with your choice of pollo or carne) and topped with this amazing Jalapeno Cream Cheese sauce... honestly if they could just put a plate of that cream cheese, a little bit of chicken, and some chips - it would pretty much be the greatest dish ever! (Good Idea to try out next time!!)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Restaurant is large; it's hard to imagine there being much of a wait during prime dinner times. The staff is friendly and attentive, but the food... not so much.  Chips are fine; salsa is OK, and you also get a small bowl of warm refried beans. Prices are fair in regards to portion size. I do like that the vegetables they use are very fresh; I hate getting veggie enchiladas, etc. that use frozen, poorly cooked vegetables. The zucchini was fresh, crisp, and pretty good. The rice and beans were too salty in my opinion. Food was average at best.  Definitely not the best Mexican food I've had; I am surprised at the high rating. However, service was good (our drinks were never empty, and we didn't have to ask for a refill on chips). The server also asked about how we wanted our check split, which helped avoid a lot of hassle.  Not sure if I'll be back, but definitely not a bad experience by any means. Just not my kind of food."}
{"text":"Even though Serranos has a few chain restaurants, it has to be the most authentic tasting chain Mexican restaurant in Arizona.  I got the chicken fajitas and they were literally sizzling.  What I enjoyed about my meal was the serrano chilis they put to add a little kick to the fajitas.  Another one of my criterias for a good Mexican restaurant is the salsa, since I literally pour salsa all over my food.  They had kind of a bean dip salsa and a regular salsa, and both taste really good together."}
{"text":"This was my third attempt in 13 years to get a decent Mexican dish from this place.  FAILED AGAIN.  Overpriced, the worst Mexican food ever, my Chimichanga was more like a burrito, not fried enough at all.  When they are busy, the food is clearly uncooked and rushed.  For the money, Taco Bell is way better.  What does that tell you?  If you want great Mexican food, head to South Tucson and 4th and 6th Avenues just a couple of miles off I-10, take the 22nd Street exit then go left (east).  Macayo's hands down has the best Mexican food in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"We tried Serrano's for dinner while visiting family in Mesa. This was some of the best Mexican food I've had. It was more authentic than most other places we looked into, which is exactly what we were looking for. They seem to have a really wide variety of dishes, which was perfect for the varied tastes in our party. The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip were great. The chips are served fresh, and the bean dip is hot! Service was great and the prices were fair. It took a little while to get our food, but we were fully satisfied munching on the chips and bean dip, which they refilled on request. We will definitely return the next time we are in Mesa!  Recommended: Bean dip (amazing!) and Enchiladas Suizas"}
{"text":"we went here last month and received a survey and when I did the survey I received a code for $5.00 off.  We went to eat here tonight and the manager didn't want to honor the $5 coupon, we have been eating here for 3 years, we will never be back 707857 Beth chk 3629 Dec 18  5:23 pm Gst 2 We were so embarrassed.  Why give out a survey if you make us feel bad for doing it."}
