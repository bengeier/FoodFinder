{"text":"Went at nite maybe 10 pm, well drink prices low  and service good for a restaurant /dive bar.
Most people were friendly too.
Will go back on a live music night."}
{"text":"We first came here to support karaoke on Wednesday nights. Our first visit the staff was not very friendly and their spiral fries were cold, greasy and not good at all. We've been back a couple of times and our visit last night was by far the worst ever. I ordered mozzarella cheese sticks but they only had two sticks out of an order of five. They were supposed to make them for me at no charge, but I never got them. They are permanently closing their kitchen and it's probably a good idea because the cook isn't very good and neither is the food. I ordered a medium cooked cheeseburger and it came out well-done. After I sent it back, it came back out medium, but without the cheese! The cook brought me some after my husband went to the kitchen and told him...and  they still charged us full price for my meal! I was drinking sprite but the bartender refilled my drink with water...I guess that was partly my fault because all I heard her say was \"would you like a refill.\" The staff was very friendly last night for the first time since we've gone there, but I guess that's because just about anything that could go wrong did. The bartender gave me a shot for free because they felt bad, and that was very nice of them. The karaoke dj had become very unfriendly, I guess because we don't follow her around to all of her karaoke nights, and she pushed me way back in the rotation after her regulars. She was the main reason that we continued to make the trek from Sahara/215 to Rancho/Cheyenne to come here. She has one of the best song selections in town. But last night just sealed it..we won't be back...at least not for karaoke!"}
{"text":"The one big problem that I have with this place is their failure to update their calendar of events.  Is it that hard to post what is happening during the month on their calendar?  We like the place for country dancing.  We would go there more often if we new what was going on."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you:  the food here is excellent!  The staff is friendly and very helpful.  We ordered burgers, fries, onion rings and sliders. Everything we ordered was hot and tasty. I would definitely recommend you give this place a try.  Their stuffed burgers are a step away from the norm, but very good!"}
{"text":"My GF, sister, her boyfriend, and I came here to watch Block 16 perform and we had an absolute BLAST. Not only was the music amazing (a WIDE variety of music that got everyone up and dancing or head banging at one point during the night), but the service was beyond what I expected for a dive bar. Our bartender - Penny, I believe - was the most amazing bartender I've ever encountered. She let my GF try Crown Royal Apple and an IPA before letting her decide what she wanted. When we asked if the bar sold cigarettes rather than having to buy them out of the machine (we didn't have cash), she gave us her pack instead. Oh and they serve Micheladas, which is this Mexican girl's dream!

The waitress from our table was so much fun. She would come serve us, go dance across the dance floor and hit the next table. And she was an older woman, which made it even more fun. She took really good care of us. Truly, we enjoyed our time. I'm hoping that Block 16 will perform there more. 

They also offer line-dancing classes."}
{"text":"Went to see some live music on a Friday night. Great remodel here. The bar was very open with plenty of seating. The beers were well priced and we enjoyed Those Guys Pies."}
{"text":"the old Larry's Villa strip club has made some improvements. The dancing poles still exist but they now seem to be but mere throwbacks to the stripper days. Now, it's a very spacious bar with a decent sized stage, a large dance floor and large bar with plenty of room. Pool tables line the south wall. Drinks are good and cheap, always seem to have shot and/or drink specials going. Live music when we were there, sound is decent too, not so loud that you can't converse with your party. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here on a whim because it was close by. Menu is fantastic and the food was even better. The bbq bacon burger is out of this world. Hands down, one of the best burgers I've ever had! Will definitely order from here again"}
{"text":"The Hideaway has re opened under new ownership. The space is huge and not dingy,  that is a huge plus. They have a spot for live bands on the weekends. The service was great, the food was very good, the wings are fantastic, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, the spaghetti was delicious (for those of you that don't know, I am normally not a pasta fan, thus the disbelief, but enough about me,now back to the review) It is a bit off the beaten path (thus the name) but worth a trip out there to have a relaxing evening with friends in a non DB setting. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"This place is great. And they have cheap beers and you can watch drunk people do karaoke and attempt to line dance. The parking lot kinda sucks when it gets crowded. You have to park in the back, in the very not well lit area. I would advise any females to walk in groups if you have to park in the back. Other than that it's a fun time. When it's packed in there, I have only seen two bartenders at most work, they try to give everyone service in the order they walk up to the bar. Overall I've never had to wait more than 5minutes for a drink there. On a slow night, a drink will be ready in less than 10 seconds."}
{"text":"Love their country Wednesday's!! Free line dance lessons, beer pong, pool tables and shuffle board keep me busy. Bartenders are very nice and the crowd is really fun. I love how they have a live DJ too."}
{"text":"Good prices drinks. If your looking for a good neighborhood bar this is it. Nice place seems like most people there on a Friday night know each other. Very smoky only draw back, but it is a bar so really what do you expect..."}
