{"text":"Vegan tasting menu! I called to warn them we are vegan, they confirmed the day before that they could accommodate us à la carte, but not with the tasting menu. When we arrived, the waiter checked with the chef, and they created a 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings for us. The food was amazing!"}

Hubby and I saved the best for last; we visited Toqué! as a final finale of our Montreal lives in January before moving away. We didn't mean to save Toqué! for last... it happened as a coincidence and I'm glad we got to visit the restaurant before leaving.

We made a reservation through Opentable and let the restaurant know beforehand that (1) we were going to have the Tasting menu, and (2) that I was pregnant so I had dietary restrictions. Toqué! called us prior to our reservation to confirm our dinner.

Because we told the restaurant we would be having the Tasting menu, our server didn't bring us the menu. He just confirmed my dietary restrictions (no raw fish, pasteurized eggs, meat well-cooked, etc.) and our night's dinner started soon after.

Before we started our tasting menu, complimentary bread was brought out. Nothing too fancy here. Because the tasting menu always changes, I'm pretty sure my pictures are a little outdated given that it's Summer now; however, the quality and creativity in the dishes are always consistent, so I hope my pictures below help you get a feeling of how the tasting menu is like overall.

The quality of each dish was amazing! As the first course featured a raw scallop, mine was altered by having it cooked through while my hubby's was kept raw. Oh how I wish I could have the original dish... nonetheless, cooked or not, it was still delicious and creative! The texture of the salmon in the second dish was phenomenal.

I'm not sure what Course 3 was- I forget. However the fourth and fifth courses (the meats/mains) were very delicious. Course 4 was beef while Course 5 was lamb. Again, mine were all cooked at least medium well (no blood) and frankly, it was still very delicious. I tend to not eat steaks when they're cooked more than medium, but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did. If I hadn't, I would've missed out on an amazing culinary experience! Toqué! has substitutions for all dietary restrictions, be it vegetarian, pregnancy, etc., so make sure to let your server know beforehand to fully enjoy your meal.

Our last desserts were different because it contained alcohol. Mine was truly interesting but very delicious. Olive cake with black sesame seeds! It was a total eye opener for me, and I think both hubby and I enjoyed my dessert a little more than his main dessert. The plating was also visually very appealing and it tasted just as good if not better than how it looked.

Last but not least- petit fours with tea. Having already had two desserts each, we didn't finish our petit fours. The house made jelly and caramels were nice and refreshing while not being overly sweet.

All the servers at Toque! during our dinner were very helpful and friendly. I appreciated how the restaurant took in my dietary restrictions seriously from Openable and didn't need a reminder when we visited. Each dish was brought out perfectly and they were also very quick to clean off and prepare our tables for the next dish. Our glasses were never left empty, and certainly no one poured still water in my sparkling water glass (I know, some restaurants do! to this day).

Our dinner experience at Toqué! was by far one of the best encounters we've ever had not only in Montreal but all of Canada. It's not ranked #1 Restaurant in Canada for no reason! The food was immaculate, quite perfect in my opinion, and the service we received was also incomparable. All the small things were noted and taken care of, something I definitely expect at a fine dining restaurant like Toqué. If you ever get a chance to visit the restaurant, we highly recommend the tasting menu as it's simply a unique creative experience you won't regret taking!

The restaurant offers Table d'hôte for lunch for a more affordable option. À la carte is also available for dinner."}
{"text":"The tasting menu is really the most amazing thing ever. The food was delicious, the wine paring fantastic. The restaurant is elegant in a non-stuffy way. 
I honestly cannot pick what the best dish was because everything was really good. it is really an experience coming to this restaurant, we stayed for about 4 hours. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Trendy scene with great food in old Montreal.  Around some nice bars.  Tasting menu is good and worth pairing with the wines though five glasses may be too much for some people.  A biting the pricier side for Montreal.  Fois gras is quite well done.
Service is friendly as is the case for now the rest of the city."}
{"text":"We dined here during our honeymoon in Montreal in March 2009.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, we found the service to be outstanding.  Each of our servers were fluent in English and explained each dish perfectly.  We elected to have the seven course meal with the wine pairing.  The wine was excellent and the food was superb.  My favorite was the shrimp with crispy bread (course 4).  I would rate this as the best meal I have ever had topping restaurants in both New York and Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came in with a really high expectation but went out with diarrhea..all I can remember is they did great job on matching sauce and food."}
{"text":"Tried Toque with my boyfriend on an innocuous Saturday.

When you pay $300 for dinner and it's not revolutionary, you're not going back. It was good, but it really wasn't that good. And given the number of empty tables, I would have imagined that they could have sat us somewhere other than the breezeway.

The service is unremarkable."}
{"text":"Toque is one of Montreals best restaurants. It is both consisent in the food and service. Having dined here over six times in the past two years I can truely say I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fine dining. 

The restaurant decor is modern and very clean lines; good size comfortable bar; nice wine cellar, open dining area. All service staff is very professional and polite.

I have had the tasting menu four time and everytime it was different and delicious. The other times I ordered off the menu. Menu is varied and has a very good selection. The salads, fish, seafood and game have all been delicious. The wine selection is very good. 

You really can't go wrong eating here if you are entertaining. The crowd is a mix of professionals, business types, but mostly thirties to fifty year olds. Parking is available both on street and garage . Be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"A truly extraordinary dining experience, definitely the best restaurant I've been to in a long time"}
{"text":"great staff and excellent service, but as with most french restaurants in montreal, not vegetarian friendly.  but the chef did create a vegetarian soup for me not on the menu free of charge!"}
{"text":"A really excellent meal - the best thus far on our trip. We loved the raw scallops, the house salad and the sea bass that melted in my mouth. We would definitely go back again. The only miss of the meal was the doughnut, which lacked sweetness and substance."}
{"text":"awesome.  each dish was balanced with lots of yummy flavors and textures.  by far the best food I've had in Montreal if anywhere."}
{"text":"Delicious. It has some very interesting and avant-garde type dishes, such as the creamed/whipped corn appetizer. The waiters and waitresses are polite and accommodating, even speaking in both English and French when they first greet you. I would definitely return the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"A classic Michelin-Level restaurant. We tried the 7-course tasting menu, except dessert, everything is very fine. Tuna, foie gras and duck are three exceptional courses. Great service as well."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had dinner here last night to celebrate his birthday.  We came in with the same expectations as with any fine dining restaurant we go to.....we want to have solid food and good service.  

The service was superb!  We were originally seated by the open concept wine cellar.  Nice view, but the foot traffic was so distracting that we asked to be reseated.  The maître d' accommodated our request as soon as he found an empty table.  The staff were knowledgeable about the food, always available when needed, but were not overly intrusive.  Their service is the best I've had in a long time.  

Now the food.  We chose the 7 course tasting menu.  As the waiter said...it's like a journey.  Well, we were started off with an amuse bouche of gravlax wrapped around a pretzel stick and creme fraiche.  Nothing new here...it was an unimaginative serving with lackluster taste.  The whole thing was at room temperature, including the creme fraiche.

Next our scallops in a half shell.  Again, nothing new.  The scallops were done correctly, but served at room temperature.  In fact, temperature was an issue for us all through the night, with food being served either at room temperature or just mildly warm.  

And so we just sat there through the death march of beautifully plated food but wrong serving temperature, unimaginative flavors or confused plates.  The cheese course was covered with potato sticks.  Seriously?!  It was this plated mess of salt on salt.  Not to mention that the texture was raspy against the palate.  

The saving grace of the night was the duck magret with duck heart.  The duck heart was done correctly and was delicious!  The breast was sinewy, skin lost it's crispiness, but it was still ok.  

Overall, there were two bright spots in a dinner that lasted almost 3 hours.  Impeccable service and good duck!  Two stars for Toqué!"}
{"text":"I now see why this is arguably Montreal's best restaurant. We got the 7-course tasting menu and every dish was original, exciting and most importantly, deliciously memorable. Forget the other high-end restaurants in town, this is the only one you need to try."}
{"text":"Went to Toque on a visit to Montreal this past weekend. Overall the food, experience, drinks were fantastic. Specific review areas below.

Service: We went to the restaurant before the Symphony and had a strict timeline to stick in order to make the symphony on time. I told the restaurant this when making the reservations and they were extremely excellent at sticking to this. In addition they offered us champagne and oysters upon arrival while we are situated in our bar seats. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable, kind, attentive, and helpful.

Drinks: We ordered a french bottle of wine and it was delicious. We are big wine people so this is typical for us for a night at dinner. They had a good selection of wines from a bunch of different regions. We opted for a Bordeaux and were pleased. We also had espresso martinis with dessert and they were made \"fally\" with maple bourbon and nutmeg. It was fabulous.

Food: Started off with the Oysters for the night - very good and the sauce they put on them was delicious. For starters we had the squash soup and sea urchin. Both were delicious, perfect sized portions, and spiced well. For dinner I had the duck loin and heart and my spouse had the striped bass. Both were extremely delicious, well sized, and accompanied well with their sides. The duck heart was extremely tender and fantastic, For dessert we had the blueberry mouse which was exquisite. If you go - have it. Hands down.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My brother and I ate at Toqué! a while ago (apologies for the delay), and we both ordered the chef's tasting menu. (The quality of the food was wildly inconsistent, so I've rated each dish individually.) Bottom line: Chef Laprise and his staff may have talent, training, and high-quality ingredients, but they could care less about your experience, your good opinion, or your second visit.

MEAL NOTES
(#0) Amuse-bouche: sweet corn and celery-rabe mousse. {****} The amuse was served as a soup: several mouthfuls of foamy liquid that had to be spooned out of a large bowl. Topped with a daub of melted butter, the amuse was essentially several spoonfuls of liquid, salty, delicately creamy-sweet popcorn.

(#1) Tuna-wrapped crostini with lime mayonnaise. {*} This dish was a big disappointment: the chili and pepper overwhelmed the tuna, and the dish was flat out under-salted. Using a prosciutto instead of tuna may have been more predictable, but it certainly would have tasted better. This dish was also a little embarrassing to eat, because it's impossible to snip tuna fat with your teeth. Each bite engendered a tug-of-war between the crositini and my mouth, with the fish strung out between. Did the chef actually try to eat this before asking us to pay for it?

(#2) Scallop, cheese, and bacon tartelette. {*****} Grizzled old culinary rule: never combine seafood and cheese. M. Laprise exploded this rule with flavour and flair. In this thoughtful, playful, and scrumptious reinterpretation an an Alsatian classic, potatoes replace the crust of the tartelette, which is then filled with in a bacon, cheese, and scallops. The potatoes, astonishingly, add air and lightness. High cuisine at its very best.

(#3) Mackerel and summer vegetables. {*} A slender half-fillet of mackerel on a capacious plate, dressed with an understated sweet soy sauce, and surrounded by a carnival of fruits and vegetables. We counted no fewer than 17 (!) distinct components on the plate, including 2 pinches of different chili powders and a smear of pesto. It was impossible to grasp how the chef thought the dish should be eaten. What goes with what? Serving a plate of bewildering options to your patrons is about as amateurish as it gets.

(#4) Charcuterie plate with sausage, stewed rabbit, pancetta, and black trumpet mushrooms. {**} Another visual and gustatory train-wreck. Everything on this plate was forgettably adequate except the sausage--dressed with what we think was a strawberry and balsamic reduction--which was divine. Those two small bites of sausage were two of the most transcendentally perfect mouthfuls I've ever had. (This dish gets one star for each bite of that sausage.) Everything else on the plate just got in the way of that transcendent perfection. Especially the bones: I found one in my rabbit, and my brother one in his pancetta. Now, bones are not supposed to leave the kitchen, but it can happen. You let the kitchen know about it, the chef (or sous-chef) apologizes, and everyone gets on with the meal. We found two of them. Our server apologized perfunctorily, but we never heard anything from the kitchen or from management. Nothing. WTF.

(#5) Seared Kobe beef with a baby leek. {*} This was the first dish ever served to me at a fine dining establishment that I sent back to the kitchen unfinished. (My brother sent his back as well.) The steak and leek were dressed with an excellent veal-stock reduction featuring (we think) blueberries and beets. The baby leek was so forgettable even my notes can't remember it. The beef was improperly cooked: excessively charred on the outside so that it tasted strongly of charcoal (not just a hint--strongly) and underdone on the inside (I like my steak bloody, but this meat was stringy). The steak was not only inexcusably over-salted, but also served without a steak knife. M. Laprise apparently thinks that \"Kobe\" is Japanese for \"contempt.\"

(#6) Lightly melted cheese over summer vegetables. {***} Sweet yellow tomatoes and summer squash under a blanket of slightly melted cheese, dressed with fresh herbs and blueberry vinegar. Unremarkable except for the blueberry vinegar, which was utterly extraordinary. Another instance in which the best item on the plate got lost in the effort to impress the diner with packaging.

(#7) Dessert: Raspberry tart and blackberry sorbet. {**} The tart was composed as a tower raspberries, whipped cream, and pancake crisps. The accompanying blackberry sorbet was competent, but unimaginative. One welcome surprise was the presence of tiny clippings of fresh, fragrant herbs beneath and over the whipped cream, each of which provided a startling little burst of flavor in a fancy-looking presentation of raspberries, whipped cream, and pancakes. Fresh berries are wonderful, but I expect a great chef to use his skills to improve his ingredients--not simply re-label them."}
{"text":"The mushroom starter and the scallops were very good.  The bread was like from a supermarket.  And the rib eye was too gristly , served with bland vegetables.  Wait staff very friendly and accommodating.  All in all, disappointed for such a highly regarded restaurant."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Sat at the bar. One of the better tasting menus I've worked my way through. Really great service, great cocktails. Coming back when I get the chance. Well done team."}
{"text":"Tasting menu was a wonderful, leisurely, fascinating journey. Quite a tour around the animal kingdom: sea urchin, snails, chilean sea bass, beef, pigeon. Presentation is lovely. Delicate sauces made for elegant but light dishes. Fresh, fresh, fresh. And the serious is truly joyous and intelligent without a hint of pretension. Easter eve was a good time to be in Montreal: a rare, quiet Saturday night. But we will definitely return to Toque even on a busy night!"}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable, the food is cooked with precision, the plating is beautiful, sadly the taste is sorely lacking and it is unimaginative.

If we factor in service and everything I would still only give it 3 stars, but 2 stars it is. The service by itself it 5 stars!!!

We went for the MTL a table special and it was 69$ for 3 service menu.

I had the striped bass sashimi, the duck breast with confit on the side and the apple clafoutis.

The sashimi was ok, it did have some sorbet on it and pieces of kumkquat which added some nice contrast, but it wasn't anything amazing.

The duck breast was a disaster in my opinion, the breast was well cooked and placed on a bourguignon sauce. The confit was tucked under a whole lump of cheese infused mashed potato along with some mushrooms. The duck confit was salty but underneath the mashed potatoes which were also salty made it too salty, on top of that the bourguignon sauce was super salty, I mean it was way way oversalted to the point that I didn't even want to touch it. It was a combination of salty on top of super salty, it was not a good dish to eat. Is this really Toqué? 

I drank so much water, the waiter kept coming back to refill me, I very much appreciated that actually, it's rare to go to a place where your water is always filled no matter how much you drink, I know I don't have to hold back on drinking water here, how sad is it that this is the high point at your restaurant?

The dessert was in the same vein, sour upon sour, with a spoon of ice cream on the side but that wasn't enough to balance. The clafoutis was sour, paired with plum mousse which was sour and topped with a cranberry which was sour...

This was the worse meal I've had this year. 

I'm not fuming, just very disappointed. The staff is amazing, they are ghosts who appear when you need them, and the service is polite but warm and cozy if you instigate conversation, and they politely disappear when it's over they really don't overstay their welcome...we had a great time nonetheless no thanks to  the food.

When the amuse-bouche and the mignardise are better than the regular courses it doesn't say much about the restaurant. I came here 9 years ago, and it was just ok back then so I didn't bother to write a review. but now it's just unforgivable for a place of this stature to be so lame food wise."}
{"text":"I have been at Toque twice. Both times I was blown away. 

Everything, and I mean everything from the greeting to the decor and place settings, the service and of course the food is in a class by itself. 

Every morsel of food that I put in my mouth had very obviously been thought out, prepared with mastery and combined perfectly. 

Each visit also allowed me to discover new tastes. Something rather rare given my love for food and my constant quest for new and exciting culinary experiences. 

The decor and service are both conducive to slowly savoring every bite of your meal. 

There is no question in my mind that Toque is the best restaurant in Montreal. It's really in a class of it's own."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on this place.  There are much better options in Montreal. The service was a bit uptight and the food was mediocre for the value. Don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Service hors pair et très sympathique. Le menu dégustation était à couper le souffle et le \"pairing\" des vins sensationnelles. Un des meilleures restos où j'ai mangé."}
{"text":"You can't go to Monteral without eating at Toque! I was actually a bit hesitant about going because my girlfriend told me its a 3 hr experience (it is) but I'm glad I went. We both had the 7 course tasting menu and it was the best meal I've ever had. Period. If you go, just get the 7 course tasting menu. I guarantee every course will be delicious and an explosion of textures, flavors, and experiences for your mouth. What made the experience even better was Fabian, one of the head waiters allowed us to visit the beautiful kitchen and showcased each station - pastry, frying, vegetables, meat - and even the lockers were an entire suckling pig was hanging from the ceiling. Afterwards, he led us down to the 7,000 bottle wine cellar. The wine menu changes each week as they add / rotate wines in and out of the cellar when they are ready. Truly an amazing experience and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I dined here with some friends about a year ago. Did not plan to write a review because, as it was my first time trying a tasting menu, I thought it satisfied all the expectations I had: innovative & delicious dishes with top notch service. But alas, I recently had my 2nd tasting menu at another establishment and it disappointed to the point I felt compelled to join the yelp community and put in my two cents.

I don't remember the dishes I had here with detail but they were incredibly delicious! I just remembered the first dish: corned mousse because I never heard or tried anything quite like it... and ditto for all subsequent dishes except for the classic staples like foie gras terrine and lamb. The dishes were also well paced, so expect a good 3 hrs here. I would definitely go back if I happen to be in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Toque offered seven delightful, ingenius courses, professional staff and wine pairings that brought us to the gates of Vallhalla.  Bring your platinum card."}
{"text":"Yum in my tum. We were treated to a nice dinner here. Unforgettable chef's sampler. Loved the Pollock-inspired dish."}
{"text":"Our evening at Toque was good and memorable but not the best meal or service I've ever had by far. We both ordered the 7 course tasting menu with wine flights. 

There were some outstanding courses: the rabbit with pasta, the foie gras, razor scallops with mushrooms. My mouth is watering just thinking about the rabbit. But the service was off. Our main waitress was competent enough but several of the food runners did not have a good enough grasp of English to describe the dishes. This should not happen at a 5 star restaurant in a bilingual city. The staff who deals with customers should speak both of those languages fluently. There is a level of service at fine dining restaurants that I did not feel Toque met. It was no one thing but the entire evening. It was a fine evening but at $420 for two, not one that will be repeated."}
{"text":"Really good French refined food made by the best ingredients , the tasting menu takes too  much time   so I ordered the dish of fish fletan with risotto and shrimps and it was excellent , my friends had other dishes which amazed them , I would highly recommend this place , it is worth the experience the staff very attentive , the service excellent and the ambience one of the best , would really come back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Romantic setting, but tables for 2 are a little too close for comfort.  All tasty, creative flavors, and beautiful presentation.  Wait staff is very attentive.

First course: Foie gras terrine, brioche bread, green beans, marinated onion, chanterelle mushrooms and honey vinaigrette

Entree: Atlantic halibut, vegetable glaze, yellow zucchini, white asparagus, day lily buds and fresh almonds

Entree:  Guinea fowl supreme, emulsified jus de volaille, cauliflower purée and hazelnut oil

Dessert:  Meringue, blackcurrant sorbet, mousse and blackcurrant leaf infusion"}
{"text":"This is the top end of modern fine-dining.  The ambiance and the service are as good as it gets - warm, professional, unobtrusive and omnipresent.  We opted for the 7 course tasting and one wine pairing.  Montreal is know for gastronomy but most of the top restaurants still center around a French influence and don't feel they have to venture too far into the stratosphere of experimentation which is quite OK with their clientele.  Toque was not afraid to go that extra mile but brought you back periodically with beautifully prepared Foie Gras and a Guinea Fowl course.  The tasting had an option for those who are not fond of Foie Gras and my other half had a striped bass in a sauce that would rival Per Se.  Yum.  A lovely evening that did not come cheap but for a dedicated foodie would not disappoint."}
{"text":"Really great service, my water glass never hit half full. Managment was ever present in the invisible background. But other than coming by our table to welcome and ask if everything was ok ( not ok but perfect). We had the tasting menu and wine paring, it was fabulous. My wife has a gluten allergy and the chef said no problem, he made our meal gluten free and it was fantastic. This was our best meal in Years! Fantastic can't say enough!"}
{"text":"Service is mixed. The staff wore casual attire. I opted for the foie gras tasting menu. Each item was tasty. We also did the wine paring which we liked a lot. I thought each dish was creative in presentation and was tasty. An upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"I took a date here. It was her first time in Montreal. We have been to a lot of fine dining in Toronto, I wanted to show her what Montreal had to offer. This place did not disapoint. Amazing food and great service. Everything you could want in fine dining. Loved it. Next time I will wear a blazer though. I think I was the only guy there not wearing one that night."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few French restaurants in Montreal. This is definitely by far the best. Food here comes with big price tags. This is not your weekly eat-out place, where you fill your belly with gigantic portions of comfort food. This is the place where you eat food that can only be seen on Iron Chef. This is the place where you satisfy your eyes and taste buds with culinary artworks. 

My wife and I went there two days ago. We tried the 7-course tasting menu, which changes regularly. I chose the one without Foei Gras(I hate Foei Gras). My wife chose the one with Foei Gras. Every dish was very creative, w

The first two were cold sea food courses. The first was Sea scallop salad with Wasabi foam. The second was Sea snail with quail eggs and cabbage salad. They were both amazingly refreshing and tasty. I especially loved the sea snail. The light vinaigrette and mixture of finely minced pickled vegetables, complimented the sea snail meat extremely well. 

The third course was Foie Gras for her and Monk fish for me. I liked my monk fish in its wonderful sauce. 

The next two courses were both meat courses. The forth was Rib eye steak and the fifth was pork meat combination. Both were cooked to perfection. It was amazing how they made the fatty meat taste not fatty at all. 

The sixth course was a cheese dish cooked with cauliflower and hazelnuts. The seventh was dessert. Both were good, but not as impressive as the previous ones. 

Every dish was creative, well executed, beautifully presented and most importantly delicious. The flavors were sophisticated and delicate, not too strong or overwhelmingly rich. The service was adequate. The whole experience was absolutely worth the money."}
{"text":"Ordering the tasting menu here is  a big mistake. To summarize: it is a ripoff that is not well thought out and will leave you feeling like you drank a quart of cream and not much else.

In the tasting menu we were served there was no real protein other than two slabs of duck breast, stretched with very gamy duck heart. 

We were served course after course with bits of inexpensive ingredients usually blended into foam and whipped cream (for a hundred dollars plus).

When I ordered the foie gras tasting menu--at an upcharge--the waiter did not mention that the following course would be marrow; to eat foie gras followed by bone marrow borders on disgusting. One reason we chose the tasting menu was for the cheese course, but instead of bringing out the platter of Canadian cheeses (as for those who ordered a la carte) we got one slice of cheese filled with Parmesan-flaked whipped cream.  Instead of getting to taste their pastries for dessert, we got more cream--melting lavender ice cream, after the whipped-cream cheese, which had followed two other whipped-cream courses (with bits of cod, bits of corn). Despite tasting delicious, the courses seemed repetitive and it felt like they were stinting on any ingredient that cost money.

The restaurant is physically lovely, and there is talent in the kitchen,  but the tasting menu--like their hefty wine markups-- is a \"gouge-the-customer\" affair that should be avoided. I suggest ordering from the short but interesting regular menu if you want to enjoy this restaurant and feel that you got good value."}
{"text":"I didn't know anything about this restaurant, as my foodie-friend reserved it during our recent visit from NYC, and I basically just showed up. So imagine my astonishment when it dawned on me that I was enjoying one of the top meals of my life, anywhere in the world.  From champagne tasting at the start, to being served my favourite Macvin du Jura at the end, this was an Experience with a capital E.  

Service was outstanding, too: our server loosened up once he recognised we were a fun bunch, and really made our evening with his understated humour.  Thank you, I will unquestionably dine here again whenever I'm in Montreal.

(I've just read the other reviews and realised Toque has quite the pedigree...)"}
{"text":"The food was good, but certainly nothing special. The service was excellent. Judging from the other reviews, the tasting menu seems to be the way to go. We were in a bit of a rush so opted for a la carte. We started with a few oysters, which were disappointing. Our main courses consisted of the suckling pig loin and the tagliatelle, both of which were very ordinary. 

I've read reviews to the contrary, but I found the decor very tacky. The purple walls didn't work, and the background music made us feel like we were in a hotel lobby. The place lacked a drop of warmth."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary with a trip to Montreal - to eat!  We started off our culinary adventure at Toque (Jan 16).  Sitting at the bar, we enjoyed an amuse bouche of rutabaga foam with cocoa...this foam was amazing! It was more like a mousse than a foam.  The meal only got better from there with the razor clams, duck, and apple tartlet.  The bartender, Gilbert, was so personable and hospitable.  We felt so well taken care of  even just sitting at the bar!  We would have returned there on Sunday for a parting meal, but unfortunately Toque is closed on Sunday.  Thank you Toque for a very nice evening!"}
{"text":"Définitivement dans mon top 5 de mes meilleur restaurant. J'ai pris le menu dégustation et j'ai été épatée! L'oursin, la salade de homard ou le pigeonneau tout était extraordinaire! Et quoi dire du service et du sommelier merveilleux et très professionnel. Tout un expérience!"}
{"text":"I can't deny the food was pretty great here. I ordered the gazpacho with king crab and tabasco sorbet as a starter and the tagliatelle with foie gras and morel mushrooms as my main. Both were absolutely delicious. I'm glad I went with the gazpacho because that tagliatelle was SUPER rich. The service here was great. Our server was very nice as was the rest of the staff. The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five was because of the ridiculous water charge. Our table of four was charge four dollars per person essentially for water. $16 for water?! WHY? We didn't ask for bottled or sparkling water. It was just an unpleasant surprise at the end of a great meal."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Super delicious food. Service is top class. We were a large group and waiters were always there and super attentive. They were pretty good at serving the food at the same time to everyone. At the end though they didn't do same when serving coffee. Some of our guys were already done by the time I got my cappuccino. Regarding the pricing I have no comment as the company paid :) but I've heard its on the pricier side. Overall great place, great food, great service, definitely deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing. I'm very particular in where I don't eat fruit not due to any allergies but I just simply don't like the taste or texture of any fruit so I was very pleased when they were able to accommodate my request without blinking an eye. They even came back to confirm the menu with my after speaking to their chef to make sure there wasn't anything on the menu that would displease me. The best part was the chocolate dessert which I devoured in no time."}
{"text":"Best meal I had in years.   I will visit again on the next trip.  We got the seven course tasting with seven course wine match.  This is fine dining at it's best.  Some of the ppl on Yelp  don't understand that it's not a burger joint.  Expect to drop some money but it is worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Toque on Sat. (Nov. 23). The food was very good. However, the service was horrendously poor for fine dining. Let's count the problems... Upon being seated, we were asked for drink orders. They do not have a cocktail menu, which is fine. But because of this, I decided I would have a good tequila. When I asked the waiter what tequilas they had, he responded 'Cuervo.' It was a big red flag that the waiter was unaware of what liquors they have at the bar. So I went to the bar and saw they also had Patron. But that's not great either, so I looked at the scotch. When I returned to my seat, I ordered a scotch, but then the wrong one was brought out. I finally received my drink. My girlfriend asked if they had a particular scotch, and was told they did not. When she requested to see the scotch list, she immediately noted they did have what she had asked for. 

I ordered the lamb loin. About 5 minutes later the waiter returned to inform me that they ran out, so I could have rack of lamb. 

My girlfriend has food allergies, and had to ask the waiter several times to check with the chef whether particular menu items would be safe for her. On one occasion, the waiter told her it would be okay. She asked him to double check, and he returned to say that she could not eat that particular item (a sauce).

As I noted at the beginning, the food was good. But even with good service, it would be over-priced. In any case, it isn't worth the hassle. The service was simply terrible. Try a restaurant where they train the servers on the bar and menu. I will never return here again.

Because of service and price, I give it 1 star. If the service was good, I would have given it 3."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband two months ago while visiting Montreal. I opted for the foie gras tasting menu while my hubby chose the regular tasting. Each item is a mystery where you won't know what they will bring out to you. We also did the wine paring which we liked a lot. Although my husband wasn't too impressed with the dishes, I really thought each dish was creative in presentation and was tasty. 

Service is mixed though. When we got there, the host did not bring us a menu until about 10 or 15 minutes after we sat down. For an upscale restaurant, we expected the staff to be dressed more classy, but the waiters wore a red checkered shirt that just seems very casual.

If I were to go back to Montreal, we probably won't go back there since there are so many more great restaurants. Love Montreal!"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife last night for my birthday and we both got the seven course tasting menu with foie gras and a glass of wine.

The food and service were both amazing, and though pricey it's worth doing at least once.

We had:

    Amuse-bouche of watermelon foam, olive oil, and basil

    Scallops in apple water with daikon and sage foam

    Fois grois with a peach crumble (this was the highlight of meal, totally unexpected)

    Tuna sashimi in a soya miso sauce (very familiar)

    Tuna steak with a corn mousse and bell pepper puree (also very familiar, which is in some ways disappointing)

    Squab with a madara sauce and turnip puree

    Squab with a madara sauce ball (same as above but wrapped into a single lightly fried ball)

    A couple of local cheeses, one with a port reduction, another with a red wine reduction and a homemade pickle (I would have skipped this if given the option)

    One plain pastry with granola caramel, granola, and a raspberry reduction, and another with a thick caramel, granola, and lemon sorbet"}
{"text":"Best dining experience in my whole life. Service, food, presentation, ambiance, wine pairing, everything was perfect and beyond my expectations from A to Z. If you go just go all in and have the tasting menu with wine pairing, you won't regret it. High five to Toqué for serving exclusively local food! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this restaurant, I had to try it out during my trip. Opted for the seven course menu. Selected the option with the Fois Gras. For the tasting menus, they seem to prepare the menu based on your food preferences, so you have no idea what you'll end up getting. They made a vegetarian menu for my wife. 

Amuse Bouche: A brioche filled with Gruyere cheese. Not especially good (brioche was slightly cold, and the cheese wasn't that soft), but thankfully wasn't an indication of the food to come. 

Course 1: Scallops in the shell with Rhubarb water and Wasabi Foam, with cilantro oil. Phenomenal. It was very light and refreshing. The foam wasn't overbearing and went really well with the food. 

Course 2: Razor Clam: Sort of an Asian inspired version. They had a soy/sesame oil broth at the bottom. 

Course 3: Fois Gras, Apple Water, Baby Peas. Excellent. I'd never eaten Fois Gras before, so I can safely say it's the best Fois Gras I've ever eaten :) The peas were perfectly cooked and the apple water added a nice sweetness to the dish. 

Course 4: Rabbit and mushrooms. Delicious. The right amount of earthiness. 

Course 5: Squab: Don't remember too much about this, but wasn't a big fan. Too little meat and a bit too gamey for poultry. 

Course 6: Cheese Plate. It was melted Gruyere with mushrooms, whipped cream, radishes and a crouton. 

Course 7: Dessert. By this point, I had eaten so much I can't even remember what I was eating. All I remember was that there was some sort of sorbet and white chocolate with a meringue on top. 

Service: Excellent. Patiently explained all the dishes to us. Very knowledgeable. One of my wife's dishes had the famous popcorn powder on it. I asked them how it was made and it was surprisingly simple. I'm going to try it out at home. Hopefully I won't start another fire in my kitchen. 

I also had a wine pairing with the dinner. All in all, definitely worth it, and Toque is going to be a stop every time I go to Montreal. For the amount of money that you end up paying this is a very good deal."}
{"text":"Terrible.
As stated by some. I was very disappointed in the seven course meal. Not worth half of what is being charged and worse.... it does not taste good.
The first and last item were the only items I liked, I could not wait for it to end.
The foie gras which I usually love was grilled and greasy, the Quayle was raw, the lamb was raw and the cheese was a slice of cheese over vegetables (really).
The restaurant should let you know what will be served and not make it a surprise because obviously it always the same based on the reviews.
Don't waste your appetite and money."}

{"text":"I spent a wonderful evening with my wife at Toqué ! We both ordered the tasting menu with the five wines pairing. The dishes were impressive, sometimes daringly simple but always packed with flavour, prepared with ingredients that were in season at the time (green beans, girolles, peas, blueberries, strawberries, etc.). We had a Scallops ceviche as a first dish, girolles with sage as a second, foie gras, blueberry and and buckweath threeways as a third, lamb with a tomato coulis as fourth, deer three ways as a fith. My wife had a first dessert of blueberries served with a pine tree granita (!) while I had a chesse dish (see below). Wo both had a second dessert dominated by strawberry and miso flavours. All of the dish

I was as impressed by the wine pairing as the dishes, as well as by the work of the young sommelier. The more predictable high quality wines often had an interesting unconventional element and most of the wines were unconventional yet delicious. We drank a Sancerre made frome grapes with noble rot, a Greek white from Macedonia, a Chardonnay from the Jura, an unrecognizable 14.5 % Gamay from Serbia (exit Beaujolais !) and a Brunello di Montepulciano. When the 5 wines were gone, I was enjoying the wine so much that I decided to switch to the 7 wines pairing, which turned into an 8 wines pairing as the staff was kind enough to serve us an ounce of Vino Santo to go with my wife's first dessert and an ounce of Beaumes de Venise to pair with my cheese dish. We finished with a sweet Monastrell wine, once again unconventional yet delicious. 

I have very few elements of criticism. I will say that teh cheese dish was considerably challenging (a bed of olive oil, soft white cheese, a rasberry granita AND a spinach granita) but I did not dislike it. My main criticism would be that a deer dished which included a sausage was served after a lamb dish that also included a sausage. Something like game bird meat as a fourth course would have made the central part of the dinner more varied. 

Overall, you should believe the hype : Toqué ! does not disappoint and is still on top after more than two decades. The owner Christine Lamarche greets makes sure everything runs smoothly in the dining room. If you are lucky enough to be a young chef (like the guy sitting behind me), you may be invited to see the kitchen staff preparing dishes, an invitation I was pleased to witness and which shows that Toqué ! is part of something larger than itself. If you stay late enough, maybe Normand Laprise will appear behind the bar, wearing a bright blue t-shirt, being cool without even trying, looking relaxed and unsurprised that his customers are having the best meal of their lives."}
{"text":"I came here for the tasting menu this weekend. The service was incredible. Having eaten at other comparable restaurants in the U.S. (Eleven Madison Park in NYC, Gary Danko in SF), I would say that Toque far surpasses them in terms of service and flavor. The dishes at Toque were focused on their respective star ingredients. Every course felt like something that came out of Iron Chef.  We also had the wine pairing, and each wine truly elevated the course that it was served with. The service is familiar, warm, yet polished. We had a four hour meal that was the highlight of our trip to Montreal. Not to be missed, and a steal for the money!!"}
{"text":"At first entrance it looks as of you are walking in to the Admirals club for American Airlines at the airport. The light is entirely to bright, the color and the decor of the restaurant dark browns and reds mixing into one creating a draining feeling, flowers like a funeral home and the waitrons uniforms just like my grandmothers Sunday attire.  

But things start to change when the food arrives. An elegant sorbet is served with wild flowers tantalizing the senses. We choose three appetizers which where all unique and superb on their own. The white asparagus is shaved and served with a lovely display. The snails where rich in texture with garnishes of cucumber and creamy sauce. The tomato and lobster reminded me of a typical lettuce wrap and where very nice rolled up into a scrumptious bite. 

We ended with a lemon crud and ginger ice cream that was divine. The food really does deserve top credit, but with a decor and ambiance so bad I would say its doubtful that we return just because in Montreal so many other excellent options all around."}
{"text":"Yes delicious!  Atmosphere is upscale casual and quite cozy. Wine selection is spectacular. Enjoyed a bottle of the Penfold Grange -- which was absolutely delicious!  I chose the squash soup - light and tasty; the seared tuna -- delicious but over cooked; and the fruit sorbet - refreshing. Service far exceeded food."}
{"text":"Having heard many good things about Toque I'd been looking for an excuse to eat there and when I learnt that they were now open for lunch a business lunch was a great opportunity. 

The food was very good, sorry I ate there a few weeks ago can can't remember exactly what I ordered, and nicely presented. The service was terrific, the manager was even able to recharge my BlackBerry while I ate, and the decor is modern yet warm. 

I certainly can't find anything to complain about, yet at the same time I wasn't blown away such that I can give them 5 stars. I was there for lunch and I sometimes wonder if restaurants hold back a little something something from the lunch crowd where the prices are typically not as steep as dinner. 

All in all a very nice experience which I would highly recommend for a business lunch."}
{"text":"fancy fancy. i love fancy food i love fancy restaurants. we made reservations here on a friday night and decided to order the tasting menu and added foie gras cause who doesnt love that?! add in a bottle of wine and your dinner is now expensive but delicious. 

the annoying part was that valet was not complimentary but was $13! once you enter, they have a closet for your jackets so that's nice. 

the food itself was delicious and the presentation fantastic. but it just wasn't one of the best that i've been to. the service was good. we had a few. one was very descriptive and answered all our questions. some were just hard to understand :( and when youre at a fancy restaurant i like to know what im eating

menu degustation - $92 each 
foie gras degustation - addt'l $12 each 
baron louis bottle of red wine - $80"}
{"text":"This list of 5-star reviews remind me of the Emperor's new clothes. I walked out at the 4th course of the tasting menu. Molecular gastronomy seems to have become \"add foam to everything\". The flavors were disgusting. The brioche that came with the foie gras tasted like the butane torch they used to char it. There was a BLT without bread that was a very large portion of something that should've never existed. The final straw was some nasty bone marrow concoction that tasted of wasabi and failed talent. 

I'm a finicky eater but my wife, a much more patient and accepting diner, was as happy to leave as I was. If you want a fantastic tasting menu in Montreal, try La Chronique."}
{"text":"When it comes to good food, hubby and I are always in. Luckily, Montreal is full of both low and high-end amazing food, and so we've lucked out in that department. On a special date night, we decided to finally try Toqué. We'd been hearing great reviews from friends and colleagues, and so we booked our reservation and excitedly made our way to this beautiful restaurant. We both knew that we wanted to have the tasting menu, to allow ourselves ample opportunity to sample as much of the menu as possible. When we do this, we consciously make an effort to pick different items so we can sample each other's plates. Now, I can't tell you about all the awesome food we had, because this review would be super long. But, what I can tell you, is that the venison is to.die.for. It's been a few months since our visit to this restaurant but I still dream about the venison. So flavorful...so tender...so heavenly. I want to go back, and just order 5 plates of the venison....yummm...

Sorry about that.. I had a moment. Back to the review.

Service was impeccable throughout the night and the food came out in a timely manner. Although we were full by the end, we were not stuffed in a sickly kind of way (like when you go to an AYCE sushi place and overdo it), and left feeling happy. Of course, the price is what you would expect - we spent around $300 for 2 tasting menus and a bottle of wine which is reasonable given the quality of the food and service you get. Overall, excellent experience. We will definitely be back (or at least I will...for that venison). If you're looking for a nice date night where you get to dress up (you NEED to dress up here) and enjoy phenomenal food, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today while visiting Montreal after reading it was rated #1.  The space is very nice and modern decor.  The service was very nice and they even offered me a pillow for comfort as I'm pregnant.  The lunch is good that they give you an appetizer of your choice with the main.  I had the Nordic shrimp which was refreshing and nice.  My husband had the salmon tartare which I think I liked more!  Bt the shrimp were good too.  Mains I had the halibut which was a nice size piece of fish and the vegetables were nice and the sauce was good.  My husband had the braised lamb that was very good a tender.  Desserts were delicious too, blueberry tart with mint ice cream and he had a white chocolate mousse with lavender."}
{"text":"Oh la la! Best dining moment in Montreal. We went there for early lunch, (Read: How to do expensive  places on a budget). Decor was very spacious and modern, yet still held a warm & intimate feel. Service was outstanding, top notch.Our waiter was very attentive & informative. 

3 course menu for lunch, 26-30$

-Appetizers:
Foie gras mousse, ground cherry, nuts and mesclun (fois gras was too buttery and rich for my taste, but it went along perfectly with the thin honey bread & nuts)
Rabbit terrine, salad, croutons and mustard vinaigrette (delicious)

-Entrees:
Leg of lamb, merguez, rosemary sauce, pesto, garlic purée and eggplant stuffed with peperonata. (my favorite dish! Everything on that plate was perfection!)
My fiance went with the plat du jour, a braised oxtail, delish!

-Dessert:
Biscuit Joconde, dark and milk chocolate ganache, nut liqueur, florentine and pistachio
Cheese cake, white chocolate, blueberry, tarragon sugar, yogurt and blueberry ice cream

Every course came with a choice of wine. I opted for only the White tha came with my app. Good pairing. We also sat in view of the 7,000 wine bottle cellar and did some great people watching. Also, good thing about a lunch time reservation is the choice to be casually dressed up rather than full blown dressy. 

Overall, the dishes were creative, delicious, and had a beautiful presentation. Left with full, happy stomachs."}
{"text":"You really do get what you pay for here. Fantastic and knowledgable wait staff combined with a truly unforgettable meal. Easily one of the best I've ever had. The flavours were fresh and seasonal while perfectly paired with their amazing cocktails. You must try it if you enjoy a good fine dining experience."}
{"text":"There were some really good moments during my lunch experience here.  The hostess already put me in a relaxed mood when I called in to make my reso.  I asked for a table for two either 12:30 or 1 and she said \"let's reserve your table for 12:45 and you can come whenever you choose\" which was a good thing because we showed up at 1:15 and of course they didn't make a fuss at all.  

I started with raw tuna if I remember correctly.  Don't know what it's called but it was served on a thin flake of something crunchy and orange centred radish slices on top.  The main was the halibut which came with the most delicately roasted vegetables.  I found the halibut itself a bit salty but I'm not sure if that because I'm from Vancouver and the halibut is different on the west coast.  Nevertheless this fish was very moist with melt in your mouth qualities.  I have to admit I wasn't sure about this texture as some parts were almost crumbly but I gave the chef the benefit of the doubt.  And let me say, it was brilliant to offer recommended pairings for only $7 for the demi size.  The wine came from some obscure places like Serbia but they tasted amazing.   The dessert was the only thing I wish could have been more exilirating on the tastebuds but the coffee was cherishable.

Overall good food and service.  My only real criticism is they could try make the experience more exciting, and by that I mean making the food exude more attitude.  Almost as though you be thinking \"damn the chef is bad a s s\".  The interiors were a bit eccentric.  And the soft spokeness or lack there of of the other patrons made me feel like I was in an Atom Egoyan film.  Only instead of the Leonard Cohen soundtrack there was no music today."}
{"text":"High quality ingredients, comfortable seating arrangements, very efficient and careful service, wide selection of good wines, and above all, an extremely delicious culinary experience. Toqué is simply the best restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"I can't figure out how this place gets good reviews!
Obviously people coming form a burger culture would think this joint has good food otherwise it makes no sense. 
People, paying big $$$ does NOT make the food good!!
They do have good service, (although very \"mechanical\" as if following an exact list of things to do) and a decent wine list, but the chef should REALLY stick to hot-dogs or poutines!
Cold, dry, tasteless plates, that do indeed look good, however lack any type of taste. 
Also, the ambiance is rather dry,(like the food) lacking any type of background music.
They do have amazingly good cocktails.
Do yourself a favor, go for the mixed cocktails, run like hell anywhere else for food!!"}
{"text":"so impressive. I tried the tasting menu and it was a right choice. Everything is so elegant and perfect. Definitely the best place in Montreal. I think I will go again."}
{"text":"Pros: Service was attentive and on point. They worked as a team and we always felt attended to, without being overbearing.

The food that was served was executed on well. The Squab that came as part of the tasting menu was particularly well done. The sweet desserts (tart and molasses cake) were delicious. 

We did notice many of the chef's attempts at 'surprises', which is a fun concept in theory...

Cons: The savoury dessert option (cheese option) was, without a doubt, the most horrid dish my wife and I have had in years. She physically gagged, and I left the dish unfinished. The nearby tables seemed to be suffering a similar reaction.

We were not sure if this was an attempt at a surprise, but in our view a surprise has to be a pleasant one to enhance the dining experience.

The Squab followed a course of Quail, both of which were well done but with flavours that were similar enough we felt disappointed. The Squab liver/heart was a redeeming surprise and cute touch.

As a result, there seemed to be a lot of similarity in the wine pairings. Lacked variety and interest compared to what we're used to.

Finally, the razor clam was well cooked but the flavours were bland. 

For $600 for two tastings, one wine pairing and tip I know we can do better. We'll try other options when next in town."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was beautiful and wine from st Edwards island superb. Service amazing. Most try."}
{"text":"What mob owns this place and how much did they pay to have it listed as one of Canada's best restaurants? 

It looks like a Denny's procreated with a Cora's inside.  Outdated interior and outdated idea of what constitutes good service.  

Just a helpful tip: the dehumanized staff approach isn't in! Just let them be people, everyone knows that no one actually wants to be a server and they're just there making enough money to get fucked up on the weekend.  It's also painful to watch a feigned performance when it's 2016 and we've all been to the puppet show and seen the strings.

Oh one more tip: if you forget to salt the water that the pasta was cooked then no amount of adding salt after the fact will bring that pasta back to life.  Also when two people both don't eat their mains then consider taking it off the bill or replacing it with something the kitchen staff actually tastes before it leaves the pass."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.5/5.0

Came here last summer for their tasting menu and it was an absolute treat. 

Their courses are fairly substantial in terms of portion size and leaves you very satisfied at the end - I was pretty darn full to be honest.

Each course was executed perfectly and I can definitely say that this was my most favourite dining experience of all time."}
{"text":"This place is a sure-fire bet for a perfect dining experience. The meals are expertly crafted, innovative, and absolutely scrumptious! Their service is phenomenal and the atmosphere is  refreshingly light and fun for an institution of its calibre."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp allowed for half stars because Toque! is 4.5 in my mind - not perfect, but darn close.  I did the tasting menu with foie gras the other night and I'm so glad I did.  The entire meal was awesome - I can't think of a single dish that wasn't exceptional.  One member of my party thought the amuse buche was salty, but that was the only negative the entire night!  I loved the sea urchin soup, probably the best sea urchin I've had and I thought the bone marrow dish was fun and inventive.  Overall the food was top notch.  At this point you're probably wondering why not five stars!  Well the service was somewhat sporadic, but not bad either.  At the beginning of meal it's like they forgot to put our order in because the amuse came out quickly and then nothing while we watched some tables around us power down two courses.  They apologized for the delay and then things started going.  Some servers were also friendlier than others and I thought it was strange how we seemed to have a different server for each course.  Overall the experience was great and I'd eat here again - truly great fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Le meilleur restaurant de Montréal, sinon du Québec et le plus connu aussi. Tous les plats au menu sont à essayer, même ceux qui, vous pensez, ne vous plairaient pas en temps normal. L'équilibre des saveurs et des textures dans chacun des plats et l'unité du menu sont renversants! C'est le meilleur restaurant à lequel j'ai mangé dans ma courte existance."}
{"text":"Toque, work in progress. 

Setting - 
Décor was a little dated and dining room was stuffy. 

Food- 
Amuse bouclé: corn soup had a flat flavor and lack of texture. No, it does not taste like popcorn! 

Oysters: maybe it was our luck, the oysters were Not fresh that night and left us with a fishy taste to start our meal. 

Foie gras Terrine: ask the server for a plate of sea salt, otherwise, the terrine was pretty good. I especially enjoyed the warm and EXTREMELY buttery brioche bread. 

Scallops: cooked perfectly, but not very memorable. 

Entrée Gnocchi cooked with Foie Gras was the star of the night! Perfectly flavorful Ricotta Gnocchi topped with LOTS of foie gras pieces. Although oily, it was very tasty. 

Entrée suckling pig - bring your own knife, because Toque does not have steak knives. The waiter was really nice and offered to send back to the kitchen and have it cut up. But the pork was a little over cooked with very little flavor. I wish they could be a little more generous with the jus. 

Dessert chocolate cake - plain, simple, nothing special. 

For a restaurant like Toque, with a celebrity chef's name one the door, the price tag on the menu, and the ambiance it tries to create, we went with a lot of expectations, but it fell short in many ways. Overall, the food was good, but we found it safe and uninventive. Other than the gnocchi with foie gras, everything else, including the decor, still has a lot of room to improve."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in with our 4 month old son.  Despite lunch being almost over, they promptly seated us and kept the kitchen open.  
The service was superb.  Seriously, some of the best I've ever received.  My wife is gluten-free, and they even made sure to bring her gluten-free bread for the table.
The food was excellent.  I got the duck with the nordic shrimp.  My wife got the tomato soup.  We were both pleased.
Will return.
Will recommend."}
{"text":"Oh, Toque! You tuk all my money, but that's OK.  We went in knowing we'd have to take out a loan to eat here - - and it was worth the quick jaunt to Montreal for it. We may be the poorer but our stomachs are the richer.
We opted not to do the tasting but went a la carte (French for 'arm and a leg'). I had a lamb tartare appetizer and the halibut main course. My gf had the fluke appetizer and the lobster appetizer. Hands down the halibut was but a dream. The fish was a light, pillowy bite. The mushrooms were shroomy and meaty. It was a perfect combination and probably one of the best dishes out. Everything else was great as well, and my gf enjoyed the red wine selection.
This place is on a lot of 'best' lists for Canada, and it is fancy. They give ladies a hook to hang your purse from the table so it DOES NOT touch the floor. Either that's super classy or they have mice. 
The one-star deduction is for the waiter. He was perfectly nice, but he kept forgetting what my order was and had to come back twice. Certainly not a big deal, but why can't these upscale places ever forget to charge for one of your orders?"}
{"text":"Haut lieu de la gastronomie Montréalaise, mondialement reconnu, le Toqué reste après toute ces années un incontournable pour les épicuriens. Je n'élaborerais pas trop sur la carte car elle change sans cesse mais insisterais plutôt sur la constance.
De l'accueil, au service, aux judicieux conseils de leur sommelier, et bien sûre de ce qui se retrouve dans l'assiette, le Toqué est un modèle d'excellence, d'exécution. 
Pour que je réussise à manger du coeur de bison et en redemander, on amène la cuisine ici à un autre niveau."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our anniversary so naturally we want the best restaurant a city has to offer.  So when we were in Montreal this was the only restaurant that's certified Relais & Chateaux.  We have been to a few of them so we expected nothing less.  We both ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing. First, the sommelier missed the wine for one of our courses and we had to remind our waiter to tell him!  The 7 courses was on and off.  One of the waitstaffs ( there are many that served us, don't know why but it seems everyone rotate serving all th tables) was so callous when she was describing the course that it actually made me not want to eat it.  Then the bill came, it was a R&C price but not the service nor the food.  I am so disappointed that I am writing to R&C about this. Don't waste your money because for this price I expect a lot more and this is merely a very good bistro and nothing more."}
{"text":"Great place, get the foie gras for an appy, it's amazing.

The entire experience was wonderful, good service, great food, servers dressed in cute costume esque attire. 

Also, don't make the mistake i did, dress up a bit. Arrived wearing a skirt and tank top and felt underdressed compared to everyone else who was dressed semi- formally."}
{"text":"This place show up on just about every \"Best of ...\" list and deservedly so. The ambience is upscale French with clean lines, plenty of light and elegant décor.
We had the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairings, and this experience is now the benchmark for tastings I have experienced in my life.
Each dish, from the amuse bouche through the dessert, is so artfully presented and with such pinache that the overall experience is difficult to overstate. Expert service accompanied each plating, with clear descriptions of both the dishes and the wines, and enough skill to answer any question we could muster. This was a true gastronomic experience, a journey through flavours, textures and combinations that intrigued, challenged and tantalized the tastebuds in turn.
I can honestly say that now I can check one more experience off my bucket list.
Bravo!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I made reservations several weeks in advance for a Friday night and were seated promptly at a great corner table. I REALLY wanted to love Toque, especially after hearing so many wonderful things, but the experience fell short. 

Our group started with the champagne and oysters and then opted for the tasting menu with five wine pairings. There were a few standout dishes (artichoke foam, suckling pig, and duck), but the rest of the menu failed to impress, especially given the price point. I'd opt-out of the tasting menu if I went again. 

The space was nice and the service was impeccable; the staff made us feel welcome and catered to every need."}

{"text":"They have great service and great wine! There's no doubt about that. It's known as one of the top high-end and fancy restaurants in Montreal, but it's all art and decor for me instead of food and taste. They all look perfect in pictures, but not in my taste buds. Sorryyy!"}
{"text":"This may be the finest modern restaurant in Montreal, complete with some of those El Bulli style molecular gastronomy techniques.  We went for the 7-course tasting menu, and loved every course:

1.  Scallop with rhubarb water and wasabi foam

2.  Razor clam

3.  Foie Gras, apple water, potato confit, asparagus, radish, and almonds

4.  Rib eye carpaccio, shitake mushrooms, asparagus, popcorn powder (Yes!), parmesan, and garlic

5.  Duck filet, turnips, beets, carrot, pancetta

6.  Melted Gruyere, mushroom, whipped cream with pepper crouton sautéd in olive oil, radish, honey, with thyme on top

7.  Rhubarb compote, sorbet and chips, merengue, yogurt, and fresh strawberry

I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Long overdue for a night out on the town with my bestie, so booked us a table for two at Toque when she announced a visit to Montreal.  It's been years since I've been and was her first time.

Decor is minimalist without being sterile, burgundy walls, a few modern art pieces, bottles of wine artfully suspended from the ceiling.  

Started off with a delightful champagne tasting, two different vintages that were thoughtfully explained by the  sommelier.

The amuse bouche was a little taste of fish soup (was too giggly from champagne to pay proper attention to explanation).  

I had the Jerusalem artichoke soup with black truffle oil to start, spot on, rich and velvety without being too heavy.  My friend had the foie gras and duck ravioli which she pronounced equally good.  

Had the rack of lamb as the main course and my friend had the venison.  Both dishes were quite elegant and simple and let the quality ingredients shine.  Alas what I thought was a mushroom on my plate was in fact a kidney... not one of my favourite organ meats, but aside from that, an excellent dish.  

The real star of the night was a Spanish red wine, chosen by the sommelier, who was a real delight.  Knowledgable, friendly, and approachable.  

Rounded off with a delightful dessert, a gin-infused panna cotta with blueberry accents.

Toque is a pretty serious food resto... not a place to encounter experimental or playful cuisine.  But if you're looking for elegant modern French cuisine immaculately prepared, this is the place."}
{"text":"Dinner was simply amazing. I learned that each dish starts with the selection of the wine followed by building the dish around the flavour profile of the wine. I was impressed with the amazing balance between wine and the dish and the gentle progression from dish to dish. The ambiance was excellent and the artistry in the selection of plates and presentation of each dish was also impressive."}
{"text":"Did the 7 course menu. They start you off with bread and butter. They give you a teaser which is chicken mousse, amazing, it is wrapped in a delicate crust and has a pistachio in the center. The first course is a scallop and mousse dipped in blood orange juice, it was fresh and delightful, the mousse was a bite of heaven combined with the soft tender raw scallop. Second course was flounder tartar with a seaweed mousse, blood orange and caviar, Wow! It was very fresh and when you mix all of it together it tastes divine. Third course was foie gras with an orange sweet sauce, the foie gras was buttery and tasted great. Fourth, braised lamb served with olives, fingerling potatoes and a you fury base sauce. Fifth duck breast, duck heart, potato purée. Sixth, pre-dessert almond mousse cake served with pear ice cream. Last but not least strawberry mousse, white chocolate and a red pepper sorbet sprinkled with merengue. Everything was delicious highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Quite good, but because of the hype around this restaurant, I was expecting better. There are better options for cheaper."}
{"text":"Le Toqué n'a plus de réputation à se faire, il est nommé parmi les meilleurs restaurants au Canada chaque année (souvent le 2e meilleur même!).
Nous y sommes allés un midi pour l'essayer. Nous avions réservé pour 11h30, heure d'ouverture. Cela permet d'éviter le rush de midi..
Le service est bien évidemment impeccable, on vous accueille par des Mme/Mr et votre nom, on vous prend votre manteau pour le mettre dans un grand placard en guise de vestiaire, puis on vous installe à votre table. Pour les dames, il y a des crochets pour accrocher le sac à main à votre table.
Au début, on vous sert 2 sortes de pain: du pain frais et des croûtons, avec du beurre. Le pain frais ne m'avait pas l'air si frais, il était un peu sec selon moi. Les croûtons étaient très bons.
Au niveau des plats, nous avons essayé en entrée, la soupe de topinambour et le gigot d'agneau à la rémoulade puis, en plat principal, les agnolotti ainsi que la raie. 
Entre chaque plat, on vous passe le ramasse-miettes bien sûr.. 
Dans l'ensemble, nous avons tout trouvé très bon, très savoureux, et très bien présenté également. Le service a été rapide, car nous avions demandé en réservant, de pouvoir manger en 1h max, ce qui a été respecté.
Le seul petit hic que nous avons trouvé, et que j'avais déjà entendu dire au niveau du Toqué, c'est au niveau des quantités, qui ne sont pas des plus copieuses... Si on regarde mon assiette de raie, il y a 2 petites ailes de raie, et peu d'accompagnements..
Mais bon, dans l'ensemble, ce fut une très bonne expérience!"}
{"text":"If you're a gay couple wishing to spend a good night at an open minded place on Valentine's day in Montreal, don't go to Toqué. The front desk staff gave us a really annoying look when my wife and I entered the restaurant. It totally spoiled my experience. We didn't expect a $400 meal experience to start with a judgy look like this. The waiter was very friendly though. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The only knock is that the menu is very limited. Everything on it, however, is expertly prepared and the service is terrific. The best part was the raspberry soufflé. Wow!"}
{"text":"This place had a great ambience - the open wine cellar was very unique. We started off with the champagne tasting (can't go wrong there) however, we went towards the a la carte menu, not being very hungry - I felt the dishes were a bit disappointing but that may be because everyone around us was enjoying the tasting menu. I'd definitely go that route next time."}
{"text":"I had heard wonderful things about this restaurant, so on my last visit to Montreal, I went twice.

The first time we went on my birthday, and both I and my dining partner opted for the 7 course tasting menu. To be honest, I didn't leave in love with the restaurant. But there was a dessert on the menu I *had* to try, so I came back a few weeks later - and that left me pretty much head over heels.

I went back in June and July, and I don't remember all of the details. So of the 13 dishes I tried (between tasting menu, and the two appetizers, entrees, and desserts we got when we went back), I will just comment on what stood out.

Other reviewers have mentioned the asparagus foam. It was incredible.

One of the earliest dishes in the tasting menu was sea urchin with daikon radish and organic soy. I'm forgetting some ingredients. There were several flavors, they were very subtle. Eating this and noticing the flavors was an incredible experience.

Another dish was sea snail with asparagus, egg, and a sauce. I don't remember what the sauce was, but both my uncle and I cleaned it off our plates with the bread. It was delicious.

The dessert on the tasting menu was a rhubarb heavy creation. Strawberry and rhubarb compote, topped with strawberries, this merenge-but-drier-and-crunchier white stuff, rhubarb chips, and rhubarb sorbet. I'm not really a rhubarb kind of person, so I am extraordinarily grateful it came with the tasting meal, otherwise I never would have tried it. It was phenomenal.

On my return, my dining partner and I got the sea urchin (too incredible not to eat again) as well as oysters (yum!). His entree was ribeye with black garlic and red pepper reduction and morel mushrooms - this was part of the taster menu I had tried earlier with my uncle, and neither he nor I had been impressed by it. Whatever the issue was, they got it right this time - I tasted his entree, it was phenomenal. I got halibut over a bed of asparagus and a white sauce. There were flowers in it. This entree was among the most incredible experiences I've ever had eating anything. I have dreamt about it since my return to Columbus.

Our desserts this time were good but not amazing. (Unfortunately the dessert I had been so excited to try had been taken off the menu since our earlier visit!)

I don't know when I'll be in Montreal next, but whenever it is, I will be going to Toque. Probably not for the taster menu ... but maybe. The dishes, after all, will have changed ... and how can I pass up the chance to try seven things instead of two or three?"}
{"text":"I dinned at Toqué last week and it was quite simply the best dinning experience I have ever had. The food was exquisite (we had the tasting menu with wine pairing) and the service was impeccable. The sommelier in particular was a real pro, who managed to provide incredibly articulate descriptions of each of the wines, without sounding pompous. I also proposed to my GF on this night and the staff was really nice to accommodate 2 special requests (a dessert with a secret message in it and playing her favorite song) for us :) I was thoroughly satisfied, but I must warn that it was the most expensive meal I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a super expensive dinner on a snowy winter night.  It's a place to eat amazing foie gras and steak, or creative and beautiful food.  My scallops were perfectly cooked!  Amazing wine list and cocktails.  The service was attentive and immaculate.  Be sure to dress nice.  We were all under dressed. It's where the bankers dine..."}
{"text":"Vice nice dishes, tasting menu is my favorite in french restaurant,especially for high bigger level"}
{"text":"Very interesting food! I was not in the mood for the tasting menu so had the duck instead. The portions are a lot bigger than I expected. Often times great food establishments, the portions are tiny little splashes of food like mini-paintings. Not here!

I saved room for dessert and had the chocolate one - SO GOOD, and the zucchini cake with squash ice cream. Both were great!

The bar is great to sit at too. It is cozy and nice. The decore is tasteful. The waitstaff wear uniforms/matching outfits here too so it looks sharp. 

I highly recommmmmend!"}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to its well deserved reputation. Went with a group of 12 and had the wine pairings menu. The staff were excellent and very knowledgeable. Each meal was paired to the wine, rather than the other way around. Had a great meal (1930 to 0030).
If you can, definitely try toqué."}
{"text":"20 ans déjà que Toqué! est en opération et c'est ma première visite? Eh oui, ça m'a pris tout ce temps et la promotion \"MTL à Table\" pour me décider à y aller.
J'ai d'ailleurs presque regretté d'emblée d'avoir choisi la promotion \"MTL à Table\"... sitôt arrivé, le personnel nous a demandé si on était ici pour cette promotion et après nous avoir assis dans le coin (par pénitence?) on nous a remis le menu spécial et restreint. Le serveur semblait avoir des préjugé et j'avais l'impression de lire entre les ligne \"encore des quidams du 99% qui envahissent notre institution avec la promotion pas cher à $39 et qui ne prendront même pas de vin\".

Sur le menu \"MTL à Table\" quelque vin au verre en accord avec les plats était proposé. Comme je n'étais pas particulièrement épaté par ces choix, je demande de voir la carte des vins... et j'attends... une petite entrée \"surprise\" nous est servi... toujours pas de carte des vins... notre entrée arrive... toujours pas de carte de vins. Là je commence à être un peu impatient, j'aurais bien aimé avoir ma bouteille de vin un peu aéré avant l'entrée... mais je n'ai toujours pas eu la carte. Je réussis à attirer l'attention du serveur (qui par ailleurs semblait plus empressé à libérer une autre table pour un autre service) et je réitère ma demande de voir la carte des vins. Il me dit alors qu'il avait compris que nous ne voulions pas de vin plutôt que d'avoir compris que je voulais la carte de vin. J'imagine que c'est une présomption logique qui prendrait une \"promotion\" pour ensuite demander la carte de vins. Enfin, j'ai dû perdre un peu mon accent montréalais avec ces années passés à l'étranger et tout ces voyages. Je n'ai jamais eu de tels problèmes à me faire comprendre... ni à Paris, ni à Londres, ni à New York, ni à Atlanta, ni à Los Angeles, ni à Madrid, ni à Amsterdam, ni à New Delhi, ni à Pékin, ni à Tokyo, ni à Bangkok... et j'en passe... mais oui, à Montréal on confond ma demande pour la carte de vins!

Enfin, avec finalement la carte des vins, je fais un choix rapide pour un vin espagnol (j'ai un faible pour les vins espagnols actuellement)  le \"Vinos de Madrid, Navaherreros, Bernabeleva\" à $80 (j'imagine un choix de quidam) que j'ai trouvé un peu léger en première bouche, mais qui a remarquablement gagné en complexité avec un peu d'aération. Il s'est avéré un excellent choix pour accompagner le plat principal de canard. Ce n'est certes pas l'aide du serveur qui a guidé mon choix... il recommandait plutôt le même vin du pays d'oc qui avait été proposé au verre dans le menu \"MTL à table\" et que j'avais rejeté.

J'arrête un instant pour parler d'ambiance. En général, j'ai trouvé l'ambiance agréable. Moderne et un peu froid mais avec goût. Pas original en soit, c'est le genre de restaurant moderne qui apparaisse un peu partout dans le monde depuis le début du siècle. D'ailleurs le décor et le cellier vitré sur deux étages me rappelaient un resto de Madrid ou j'ai bien mangé plus tôt cette année. Bon, on aime ou pas. Pour nous ça allait compte tenu que c'est un resto au centre-ville sans vue remarquable.

C'est un restaurant de chef et vous êtes incité à goûter à l'oeuvre du chef sans compromis aucun. Pour vous le rappeler subtilement, point de sel et de poivre sur la table. Ce n'était pas vraiment un problème puisque les plats étaient effectivement bien réussis.

La présentation des plats est impeccable. La vaisselle et les ustensiles sont de bonne qualité, rien à reprocher sur ce plan non plus (j'avais un peu peur qu'on nous donne les ustensiles en plastique pour souligner notre status de quidams).

Je dois quand même souligner que mon entrée de caille m'a aidé à patienter un peu pendant que mon vin respirait un peu... en effet il y a peu de viande dans une demi caille et dans un resto aussi chic on hésite à utiliser nos doigts... de fait j'ai dû facilement m'amuser 20 minutes à tenter d'extraire les petits bouts de viandes. D'ailleurs je recommande cela comme plat principal à ceux qui veulent perdre du poids.

Le plat principal, une combinaison de confit et de magret de canard était succulente et tout à fait réussie.

La qualité des plats, l'ambiance et la compagnie de ma charmante épouse m'ont fait passé une très belle soirée mais je ne classerais pas \"Toqué!\" parmi les grandes soirées de restaurant de ma vie. En fin de compte, les prix sont un peu poussés pour le résultat global. Je vais me consoler en me disant que j'ai goûté des produits locaux de qualité dans un resto local de qualité et que la cuisine était irréprochable."}
{"text":"An experience worth having if you're a gourmand. I love how they make their own sparkling water. A special place, to be sure."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten a meal where you just want to close your eyes so you can savor every moment the food is in your mouth?  This is one of those places.  We often eat at great restaurants in New York and Chicago, and Toque goes to the top of the list.  Kudos to the staff for pulling off impeccable yet friendly, down to earth service in a restaurant whose caliber could easily have been stuffy, too trendy, or elite feeling.

We had an 1 pm weekday lunch, which is often my favorite way to savor a restaurant like this.  There isn't the overwhelm or spectacle of seven courses.  We each had two dishes of simple, pure heaven.  This restaurant alone will bring me back to Montreal."}
{"text":"I struggle with writing a review that is as flawless as the meal that I had at Toqué. I confess that I took countless pictures and texted many notes to capture the flavors tasted. 

Toqué offers a 7-course tasting menu as well as an à la carte menu. In the past, we've always gravitated towards the latter, attracted to various new and inventive dishes. This time around, we decided to be surprised by the kitchen and went with the tasting menu, without knowing exactly what was on it. After sharing a food allergy, we were prepared to be amazed. And we were. So, if you prefer to be surprised - spoiler alert (until the menu changes)!

The meal began with a warm, airy and velvety artichoke mousse amuse. It was a delicious start to the meal.

The silky sea urchin zabaglione combined many tastes, including whole oyster, finely diced daikon and soya in its prickly, spiny shell. The flavors of the various ingredients shone in this artful and imaginative dish where soft meets spiky. This is where the restaurant excels: the skilled chefs celebrate each ingredient, including them in distinctive and complementary ways.

Next up was the seared scallops topped with celery root brown butter and capers, served on a scallop shell with puréed carrots. I liked that the sweetness of the scallops and carrots were balanced by the brininess of the capers. It was very well conceived.

Perhaps the only course that I did not enjoy was the suckling pig loin. While the pork was perfectly prepared, pink and tender, the herbed yogurt was overly salty, taking away from the fantastic zucchini tempura and accompanying olives and mushrooms. Because of that, I ended up eating around it. The roasted red pepper coulis, as well as the rich demi-glace, were savory.

The roast lamb chop was heavenly. The thick cut of hearty meat was tender and well-marbled. Served with creamy mashed potatoes and roasted cauliflower and onions, I loved every bite of this dish, including the nicely-smoked bite of tongue sausage. 

We had a choice of a cheese course or a second dessert course. We chose the latter, which runs counter to the palate of the majority of Toqué's more sophisticated clientele. The first dessert featured a cloud-like popcorn mousse with a poached apple slice. It also included a creamy Geneva apple sorbet (red apple with red flesh) and included caramelized popcorn and peanut crumble. There was even a dash of a rich and luscious hay caramel. It tasted like how hay smells. 

The other dessert included several different chocolates: chocolate mousse, chocolate brownie, and roasted white chocolate. The latter was so different and so good that later on that evening, I searched for the recipe. Other flavors of the dish included a bright raspberry sorbet, crushed meringue, and an interesting crumble of tarragon-almond flour.

As we lingered, we enjoyed a few mignardises, little bites of fruit gelée and maple sugar fudge. 

Service throughout the meal was first-class. Even with the number of meals that I've had, I rarely encounter this level of professional and warm service. The elevated service was a tangible ingredient in our meal. Our server patiently and knowledgeably answered all our questions and provided us with detailed information about the ingredients. While the meal took 4 hours, it flew by because of the well-orchestrated and choreographed talents of the kitchen and restaurant staff. It is one of the best meals that I've ever experienced and deserves its more official ranking as the best in Canada."}
{"text":"This is the best meal I have ever had in my life.  Also the most expensive; we spent about 300 for two people and that's getting steaks and appetizer and dessert.  This is one of those places where, while you're waiting between courses, they give you a little tiny bite-sized snack where they pack in about ten different flavors into an item that's maybe 5mm across, and every menu item has a list of fancy ingredients a mile long.

For example, instead of \"asparagus,\" it's \"asparagus: lettuce, camelina oil, radish, scallions, leek oil mayonnaise.\"  Which is delicious, by the way.

The steaks were juicy.  The desserts were sweet.  The servers were all over us.  They offered to call us a cab at the end of the meal, but we were staying within walking distance.  And then when we went outside, it just so happened Joute Fountain was just finishing up that fire show.


There is also the tasting menu option - for $170 - which I might do if I end up in Montreal again.   The items that come out are all random, chef's choice, with one exception: you can opt out of the foie gras.  I don't approve of the way foie gras is made, so I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Hosted a large client/prospect luncheon here last week.  The food was amazing.  Squab liver pate plate surpised all with the clever use of apple and lamb shoulder melted in my mouth.  The only reason I took away a star is because of the wine offering and the handling of the questioning of the wine with the sommelier.  Simple questions about the choice of table wine with the use of unfiltered gamay turned into a challenge of my wine knowledge.  Fortunate enough to have had most wines of the world, but found this selection fell way short of the caliber of the meal.  Check the attitude in the future and offer an alternative the first time I ask."}
{"text":"I went to Toqué with my parents during a recent trip to Montreal. The service was excellent from the moment we walked in. Our server was incredibly attentive but not burdensome. The food was wonderful and of course had gorgeous presentation. My only criticism is that some of the prices were a bit unjustified even considering the rank and of quality of the restaurant. For example my pasta with mushrooms and meat jus was $44. It was out of this world (and ultimately worth it), but on principle alone the prices were a bit crazy. Overall a delightful, unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"Was in Montréal for my birthday weekend. Enjoy tastings and boy was I in for a treat! Our waitress was delightful, very helpful in helping us choose what type of wine we wanted with dinner, it was a birthday dinner so we did the wine pairing, all reds since I'm not a fan of white.  Also accommodated my partners shellfish allergy too.  The presentation of the food was outstanding, enough time in between tastings. I will not go into detail about every dish but, if you enjoy tastings Toque is a treat and make sure you book ahead as they do get busy."}
{"text":"Ho, je ne mets pas 5 étoiles parce-que ça m'a coûté cher. En fait pour tout dire c'était mon cadeau d'anniversaire, j'ai eu une petite goutte de sueur au moment de l'addition pour mon ami, mais cri$#* qu'on a passé un moment d'anthologie qui valait tout l'or du monde.
Parlons bouffe dabord. 7 services \"surprise\" c'est-à-dire selon la saison et l'arrivage, ce qui fait souvent un grand restaurant: fraîcheur et qualité des ingrédients. Les portions sont parfaites, certainement calculées par un mathematicien pour que l'espace de n'importe quel estomac soit rempli sans pour autant déborder.  Plus ou moins dans l'ordre, pétoncle, oursin, foie gras poêlé, boeuf et agneau, tous apprêtés ou cuits à la perfection. (j'en ai oublié un oups). Les accompagnements sont aussi très originaux avec des ingrédients simples tel que panais, courges...je pense notamment au foie gras accompagné de gaufres liegeoises, pistaches roties, courge confite et poire pochée. BOUM. Le dessert était très surprenant, composé d'une multitude d'éléments soigneusement montés, je retiendrai surtout la partie meringue de sapin. BADABOUM. 
Je manque de mots et d'onomatopées pour décrire les vins. Le premier vin, blanc, provenait de Galice, une région vinicole que j'aime beaucoup. En blague j'ai averti le sommelier que ça allait être difficile de faire mieux et d'aller en crescendo sur la longueur du repas. HO MON DIEU. Je ne sais pas si c'était un défi personnel bien que le sommelier soit quand même très compétent,  mais OUI. Les vins non seulement étaient meilleurs de service en service, mais ils ont su défier mon palais par leurs saveurs inattendues. Je devrais dire inédites. Je pense que je ne boirai jamais d'aussi bons vins à moins d'en faire une quête d'une vie. 
Côté service rien à redire bien sûr. Nous avons joué la carte de la provocation toute la soirée pour détendre un peu l'atmosphère un peu pincée et attendue d'une grande table. Déjà je suis entrée là habillée à l'arrache car...c'était une surprise je ne savais vraiment pas où on allait. Tout le staff a été délicieux et ri avec nous tout le long à nos jokes plates et nos exclamations d'extase. Avec du recul j'ai l'impression d'avoir été Gérard Depardieu. Enfin nous avons fait un petit tour en cuisine pour voir où la magie se passe. En revenant à nos sièges on ne pouvait plus bouger. Et puis on voulait plus partir."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that my stomach loves me again for having blessed it with Toqué's incredible but traditional Quebec fare. 

I won't go into detail about the food, you really must experience it yourself. But the dishes are carefully prepared and most of the ingredients you'll learn are from the area. My striped bass for example was from Long Island, my lobster of course nearby from the Atlantic (to die for btw). 

They train their wait staff to know the food, and you'll see that as they rotate their staff when they serve your courses. You'll see that the other patrons in the room are there for the food, some only there for the food. The guy next to me was licking the last drops of his bisque even while the fire alarm was going off. 

If you want a taste of Quebec at its finest, Toqué is no questions asked."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!  Ordered the 7 course tasting with wine pairing - the service was excellent and the food was very good but not as memorable as I would expect for the price.  Definitely an enjoyable dinning experience, but not quite 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here recently with my boyfriend, it was a truly amazing experience.
we ordered the foie gras, roasted suckling pig, duck with oyster mushrooms and fried rice pudding.... The foie gras was the best I've tried, and the fried rice pudding which served with icy blueberry jam was absolutely delicious. Also the service was great. 
Definitely one of the best resto in Montreal."}
{"text":"A truly fantastic experience. 

I suggest the pan-seared foie gras or the snow crab or the scallops followed by the duck magret. 

I'll be going back to try the suckling pig."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her Birthday.  We opted for the regular menu.  The food was excellent.  The service was a bit off as we found ourselves looking for our waiter more than once.  The wine list is extensive and expensive.  Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Crossed off my bucket list, but once again my expectations were quite too high for this restaurant.
First off, I should emphasize I came here during mtl a table, where they served a prix fixe 3 course meal for $71. 
The atmosphere is pretty cozy, and not tense like a too high class restaurant. They had a coat check closet at the front of the restaurant. Didn't really get to explore or anything, but the decor and setting of the restaurant was very \"hotel lobby/lounge) 
They start you off with bread and an amuse bouche. The bread was decent, but I wished they served butter that was salted and rolls that weren't rock hard on the outside. The amuse bouche was a tuna confit served on a rock with cracker sticks (like pretz). Interesting touch but I feel like they can improve it, maybe something more exciting in terms of flavour.

Anyways, for starters we had the venison carpaccio and the sea bass rillette.
The carpaccio was very mild, with nutty flavours from the walnuts, and sweet and tart from the squash. I don't think the dish really came together that cohesively (I ate it by rolling up a slice of meat with the ingredients) 
The rillette was mashed sea bass with dill, topped with pickles and cheese crisps. I found this one really delicious and wished there was more of it.
For the main, we got the Iceland cod, and the pork loin. The Iceland cod was smooth, sweet and worked perfectly with the creamy sauce. The slightly charred vegetables added an extra dimension. The pork loin was perfectly cooked, but the thick cut was lacking flavour. I think the sweet sauce and the squash really elevated with dish. There was also a tough part I couldn't chew so I had to spit out the pulp. No big deal, but not something I'd expect from a restaurant of this calibre.
As for dessert, there was a chocolate mousse and apple gelée with squash ice cream.
The chocolate mousse had a delicious dark chocolate flavour, with a tart sea buckthorn berry sauce that cut through. The crunchy granola was a great touch too.
The Apple gelée was reminiscent of those fruit on the go bars, you could taste all the original apple flavours. The squash ice cream and the marscapone sauce was a great addition, but I felt like the sponge cake was a bit out of place.
Lastly, the offered a blueberry gelee and maple fudge with the cheque.

All in all, the food was delicious, service was professional and courteous. My biggest concern the fact that this meal was so expensive, even during the best deal of the year event. A wonderful experience, but price point for regular days would honestly be too high. I expected the food to be mind blowing but it was not quite there."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Toque.  We read that it was on of the finest restaurants in all of Montreal, and is known for its sensational French cuisine.  Sadly, we were rather disappointed.  We found the price to be outrageously high, given that the portions were remarkably small, the food was average/above-average (but not exceptional) and the service was good, but hardly outstanding.  Overall our dining experience was fine, and worthy of a 3 or a low 4 rating, but certainly not a 5, and hopefully not the finest Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"High end, upscale french restaurant with professional service. It was my birthday dinner and we decided to go for their famous 7-course discovery menu. 

The restaurant is elegantly decorated but not extravagant. Typical french restaurant with beautifully presented bite-sized food in small in a large plate. Classic martini was well mixed with a balanced taste. 

I really like the sea urchin, lobster and the magret de canard (duck breast). The raw foie gras did not impress me. There was a pre-dessert and a dessert, both of which were pretty delicious. 

The whole dinner experience was more than 3.5 hours with each of us only had one cocktail. If I were to go back I would probably go a la carte instead of the tasting menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Toque last weekend. 

It was my fifth or sixth time here, and to be honest, it was a disaster when compared to my other meals here. It seems as if they're trying to get too haute for their own good.
This was our meal...

Amuse-bouche: Some small cantaloupe juice with oil, pepper, and some other spices. Really not of any sort of substance at all, and relatively simple flavors, but it did start to bubble in front of us and provided a neat little distraction. 6.5/10

Scallop course: Very good, but this is expected. It's hard to go wrong with a princess scallop, and some interesting flavors (apple cider was used I believe).  7.5/10

Tuna Sashimi: Very well presented dish, and good quality fish, but I'm not a huge tuna fan. It was interesting enough however, and I was happy to get the tuna out of the way (it seems to be an inevitability with tasting menus now a days. 6/10

Halibut (for my wife), Foie gras terrine (for myself): The halibut is divine. I think Toque is the restaurant that first introduced me to well cooked halibut. The dish was maybe a touch too salty, but nonetheless, wonderful. 9/10
The foie gras was also very good. The presentation could have likely been improved upon, but overall it was one of the better terrines I've had. I believe they had some mini brioches on there which were very good. 9/10

At this point we're both very happy, and excited with the way the meal's been going, and are quite pleased with out choice (only 1 day in Montreal so it was Toque over Europea). Also, it's worth noting that the bread is excellent as well. This is where the wheels come off however. 

Cooked Tuna: What a disappointment. Tuna again. To be fair, the presentation was good, and the sauces and foams served alongside the fish were very well done, although I didn't feel they were the best suited to complement tuna. I could certainly see someone who likes tuna being a fan of this, but even if I were a fan it still could be approved upon. Factor in the banality of tuna, alongside my dislike of it I really want to give this a lower score, but to be unbiased I'll give it a 6/10

Squab: Well folks...there you have it. A main course of squab...completing the meal consisting of only fish and poultry. No pork. No beef. No venison. This was particularly disappointing. Under normal conditions this dish would have been a 5/10. It wasn't too well presented, nor was it particularly tasty. To be honest, it was very gamy, and the garnishes and vegetables alongside it were all very bland. At this point, I was pretty unhappy with the meal, but was hoping things would get better with a nice dessert. 3/10

Cheese Plate: I don't remember too much about this. Nothing to write home about certainly, especially regarding the cheese selection. That being said, they had some port jelly drops which were something special. They tickled my imagination for what else can be done with food, and for that alone 7.5/10

Dessert: Catastrophe. This was seriously the worst dessert I've ever had in any self respecting restaurant. There were a handful of things on the plate, and not one was good. They included...
Caramel Sauce (tasted like old smackers, something out of a horror movie diner)
Some rectangular creation that was much to sweet and had the consistency of mushed together fruit rollups. I couldn't taste what it was supposed to be as I was too oppressed by the overwhelming sweetness. Granola. Yes ladies and gentlemen. Granola. Like out of some whole foods cereal. I can't tell if this was intentional or if the chef had his toddler in the back whom just spilled his granola snack over my dessert, but it was there. Did I yet say I hate granola? There was also a glob of buttermilk ice cream. At first, after bites of everything else, it seemed quite good...but then I realized that was just the coolness of the ice cream, and it's pallet cleansing capability. In and of itself it was bland, but when considering how quickly it purged my tongue of the other atrocities on the plate it was very welcome. 

Financier with merengue. I don't know if it was the fact that the waiter took two almost full dessert plates back to the kitchen or if this is part of the meal (I'm guessing it is), but we received a small financier with our coffee(which was good). It was very fresh, and the merengue was one of the best I've had. 9/10

Overall I'll give this a 3/5. I want to score it lower, but outside of the horrible dessert and overuse of tuna nothing was truly awful, and compared to NYC the prices are relatively low. I'll also chalk it up to bad luck, as I've had bad experiences at most restaurants I've been to once or twice (had a terrible one at Europea a couple years back)."}
{"text":"Wow! I called my dish - especially the appetizer, fireworks! It's an explosion of flavor and no two bites taste the same.

We were thinking of looking for another place because of prices, but took the bullet and decided to stay... And were so happy we did!

The bread was ok, but every other dish after that was a work of art with a beautiful melding of flavors that created music in my mouth.

We were also worried that portions would be small, but after one course and one appetizer each we were stuffed.

Only down side was that the duck was too salty for my taste. Everything else, was perfect."}
{"text":"i was told by a friend who's a professer at The Culinary Institute of America that this restaurant, though quite expensive, was worth the price - so i decided to give it a try as my high-rolling meal on a trip out of town.

Dined as a pair, & didn't spend the sort of money you could spend here doing the tasting menu / wine pairings / foie gras.  Ordered a white from Quebec that was truly delicious even though it was nicely settled at the bottom of the wine list price-wise.  

We were sent an amuse-bouche that was a crazy mint / crab sorbet.  Not something i would've ordered, or wanted to eat a lot of, but did exactly what an amuse bouche should by just giving a wild little performance on my tongue.  

Each had an oyster to start as well - their presentation with a tiny slice of strawberry was such a pleasant way to serve & really opened up the full flavor of the truly great oyster.

Shared a tomato carpaccio with crab & an order of scallops that were served raw on the shell.  Tomatoes were excellent, as was crab - the scallops were astonishing, again served with strawberry, olive oil - wow.   Also split our main course, a foie gras cavatelli that was truly just amazing.  Finished with a mousse of truffle (mushroom truffle, not chocolate truffle) that was just texturally & flavorally amazing.

A real bummer of this meal however, was the service.  We felt a bit rushed (though our reservation was at 10) - & Our waiter had poured sediment into our wine glasses, & also failed to box up our leftovers after we'd asked him to.  Nope.  didn't want that foie gras cavatelli in the trash.

Overall would say my friend was right - if you're looking to drop some serious bones on a fine meal in Montreal, this is a good spot to pick.  Food was amazing."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal going ala carte instead of tasting which i know has gotten rave reviews.  

Vicki started off with an oyster to try, being braver than i, and found it tasty.  The bread was fresh and varied.  The amuse bouche was a scoop of herb sorbet that was a perfect palate cleanser.

She started with the mushrooms which were almost like a crepe.  Definitely a more filling starter.  I had the warm and crunchy salad which was almost a work of art in terms of presentation.  It was various vegetables with a light sweet dressing and assorted berries.

For mains, she had the tenderloin and i had the tuna.  The tuna loin was cooked perfectly medium in a nice sweet sauce with green beans and a warm tomato and bread crumbs.  A very light main.  Hers was heavier with a huge piece of beef, in bordelaise sauce and beet juice.  It was cooked perfectly though she found parts of it too tough.  The potatoes in duck fat were scrumptious.

We paused for cheese and took samples of the blue, hard and soft cheeses passing on goat cheese which is omnipresent in montreal.  They were great but even better was the warm soft bread that accompanied them and the candied almonds alongside honey, cranberry, chili dipping sauce.

For dessert she had the strawberry gateau and i had the fresh berry hamburger.  While i thought she outordered me in the mains, such was not the case for dessert.  She loved the strawberry cake with a small ring of meringue around the bottom, my dessert was amazing.  Two \"hamburgers\" with a soft meringue/marshmallow bun filled with fresh berries and just a bit of whipped cream/yogurt.  And a small scoop of fresh berry sorbet on the side.  

For wine we tried to accommodate all our dishes with a loire 2008 pithon paille that was smooth and tasty.  It wasnt the greatest wine we have had but it did the trick.  We took the dessert pairing and i had a cremant with my berries while vicki had some honey wine both of which were very good.  

If we feel more adventurous some day we will return for the tasting menu which seems like a lot more food and takes longer than the 245 we spent from start to finish."}
{"text":"I got invited for my bday supper at Toque. Let me tell you I was beyond excited and it was kind of a let down. The menu is seasonal so im guessing I was not born in the right season\"  August) 
We had the tasting menu with foie gras and the wine pairing 
The only dish that we felt was really good was the quail 
The rest was easily forgettable (razor clam salad, venison etc) 
The sommelier was really good 
Some of the staff members looked really uncomfortable and out of place (maybe in training?) 
For the price tag we looked forward to having an experience close to perfection which we didn't have 
Nothing was bad but the food didnt left me mesmerized. Basically, no consistency in the service and food. 
My friends were raving about this place but they had a different menu so next time I'll make sure to check the reviews right before I go."}
{"text":"My ladyfriend and I went to Montreal for a long weekend.  We agreed that I would pick two restaurants and she would pick the other two.  Toque was one of my picks.  

As big fans of the tasting menu at Radius in Boston, we both decided to get the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing and Fois Grois addition.  The courses consisted of:

-Tomato soup shooter
-(Don't remember)
-(Don't remember)
-Poached halibut with potato foam
-Fois Grois
-Rare duck slice with zuchini
-Goat cheese with berries

Overall impressions on food and drinks: 

I wished the bar was stocked a bit better.  I wanted a dry Hendricks Martini with cucumber, but they didn't have any Hendricks.  Upon further inspection of their bar, they didn't carry too many spirits.  This seemed to be a theme in Montreal; understandably, I think they focus more on wine than their US neighbors.

The wine choices were excellent and matched the food perfectly.

The duck and fois grois were very good, though I felt the portion of duck was far too small to represent the primary meat course.  

Unfortunately, the other dishes were forgettable overall (you can see I actually can't remember two of them).  The portions did not match up against the price and the selections were just a bit too boring for me.  Everything was presented very well, but I think I needed at least one more meat course.  

I should mention that my girlfriend was very pleased with dinner.  She particularly liked the tomato soup shooter, which was excellent, but once again suffered from being too small a course (Radius would give something away like this as a bonus).

The service was also only okay for a restaurant in this price range.  The wait staff was not very attentive, requiring you to chase them down for water refills or bill paying.  This might just be a culture issue though; other restaurants in Montreal seemed to follow suit.

Overall I give Toque a 3 out of 5.  I expect better service for my money and I was not impressed with the tasting menu.  I think perhaps I would have been happier with something from their main menu.  

Toque is good, but it's not great."}
{"text":"This place is a treat if able to visit in Montreal. I food and wine parings were a treat. Though the exec chef was out , his team was amazing. Worth the visit and price."}
{"text":"Came here at 9pm on a Saturday night, ordered the tasting menu. We had a nut/seed allergy that we made them aware of and the first course and the bread both had seeds on them, but once we alerted them to the mistake they took the food back and gave us new food and gave us a different onion bread(which was refilled as fast as we ate it) and never made another mistake. The sommelier was knowledgeable and suggested a great wine, but never came by again to check on it. The food was expertly prepared, creative, and very filling - by the 5th course neither of us could finish the entire plate. The entire experience took just over 4 hours, so don't come here on a tight schedule. A special occasion, but worth it, at $300+tip with a bottle of wine"}
{"text":"Toque Montreal is ranked best restaurant in Canada. Second on the list is Hawksworth Restaurant at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia in Vancouver. Naturally we had to try this being in Montreal for the Food Bloggers of Canada Conference. Toque is located on 900 Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle; just around the corner from Le Westin Montreal. And it is easily accessible by the Metro. Get off at Station Square-Victoria. Toque's Executive Normand Laprise culinary philosophy is all about \"une cuisine de produits\". Using fresh ingredients to delivery flavorful dishes.

Toque reminds us a lot of Le Crocodile in Vancouver. It blends traditional French cooking with innovative sense of fun. The restaurant itself is modern and patrons primarily are business professionals. We recommend dressing for the occasion. Gentlemen, remember that sports coat. Oh, and no sneakers!

Toque Tasting Menu
TWO GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE (2 OUNCES EACH) AND ONE OYSTER 30
MENU WITH OR WITHOUT FOIE GRAS (EACH PERSON) 122
WINE PAIRING : FIVE GLASSES 80
WINE PAIRING : SEVEN GLASSES 105
The tasting menus apply to the table as a whole.

Amuse Bouche: tuna apple confit with crispy bread. I love the bright apple that elevates the taste of tuna.

Blue Fin Tuna Tartare: When the ingredients are fresh, it just speaks for itself.

DUCK MAGRET AND HEART 50: This warm and earthy dish is filled with shiitake mushrooms, carrots, pear, Jerusalem artichoke, black garlic purée and Madeira sauce. The duck is rich and cooked perfectly.

SUCKLING PIG LOIN 50: oyster mushrooms, apple, celery, squash purée and poivrade sauce. In hind sight, we realized this dish resembled a lot of the duck magret and probably would have ordered the cod or the Agnolotii with duck confit and foie gras instead. Nonetheless, the pig loin was tender and quite delicious.

We didn't end up ordering desserts. We were so tired after a long flight that we didn't have much of an appetite. For desserts, I would have loved to try the blueberry mousse or the iced raspberry mousse with cocoa and almond dacquoise, Manjari chocolate ganache, and cocoa nib infusion. They all sounded fabulous.

Instead, we were presented with brown sugar fudge and white chai chocolates. The brown sugar fudge was amazingly define. It was sweet but not so sweet that makes you cringe. It melted in our mouths.

Toque restaurant is a great location for a special celebration and for those who want to experience traditional French fine dining. The prices are reasonably priced and the staff welcoming. Next time, I would want to try the tasting menu simply because we've done the a la carte style already.

I would recommend ordering a la carte and share the a few appetizers you have your heart set on. The menu can be quite decadent and rich. I hope you have a big stomach!"}
{"text":"Toque is a restaurant by Chef Normand Laprise, and it's considered and continues to be ranked #1 in the Montreal area.  Offering farm-fresh Quebecois dishes and tasting menus, the hubs and I came here for an early dinner.  We were greeted warmly and were seated right away.  We were even able to choose our seating, and I wanted to be away from the main dining room, and chose a more intimate location next to a nice wooden art piece.  We both had the 'surprise' 7-course tasting menu - the part that was interesting was that the courses are not listed - it is geared to be a surprise, one plate after another.  Of course, they accommodate to allergies and aversions, but you leave it at the hand of the chef to create dishes for you.  We started off with a crispy breadstick, wrapped with prosciutto - there was some type of a creamy sauce at the base of the dish, and the whole bite was absolutely delicious!; we then had a sea urchin cream, set on some crushed ice in a bowl - this was foamy, creamy, and yummy (I loved the presentation); we then had a watercress soup (the hubs was a fan of this, but I wasn't; the color was beautiful, but I wasn't a fan of watercress in a liquid form); a flaky fish with some pickled root vegetables; foie gras with pears and a maple glaze - a little too sweet for my taste; Quebecois lamb (I was pleasantly surprised at how non-game-y it was, but it was juicy, moist, and one of the best lamb meat I've had; I just wished it was cooked a little longer, as it was a bit too rare for me); a nice grilled and BBQ-ed squab legs (also from the Quebec region, this was not game-y at all, but a little underdone; I absolutely loved the BBQ-version, as that was finger-licking good!); a take on an arancini, but in a dessert form (this was interesting, as it was made with rice pudding; I enjoyed the dollops of the lemon curd); a semi-soft cow's cheese (this was definitely stinky, but it was pretty delicious; served with a side of housemade ricotta); a marzipan-like dessert dish (but a bit too heavy for my taste); and, some housemade chocolate/miso bites at the end.  We even received a card, signed by the chef, thanking us for dining at the restaurant :D  Our server, Jonathan, was attentive and was efficient - he recommended a great non-alcoholic ginger mocktail for us, and it was refreshing and fizzy - we ordered multiple rounds of that!  Alex and Simon were also servers who were fantastic and had a great sense of humor.  We enjoyed our meal, and I highly recommend in coming here for a special occasion. 

+order the special 'surprise' tasting menu
+request the temperature of your meats
+wonderful service from Jonathan, Alex, and Simon :D :D :D
+reservations highly recommended"}
{"text":"I rarely write good reviews but I had to write this one. I Came here for my boyfriends birthday.  We both had the tasting menu - 7courses and also some wine and champagne.  Don't get me wrong, it's not cheap, but the experience is worth it. 

When I called to make the reservation, I had mentioned to them that it was my boyfriends birthday.  Usually restaurants will just give u a candle or a piece of cake.  But at touque, not only was there a candle and a birthday card signed personally by the chef, they also gave us a private tour of the kitchen and wine cellar. 

The food was to die for.  Every course looked like fine art and tasted like heaven. I'm not exaggerating! 

If you are visiting Montreal or if there is an upcoming special occasion, make a reservation a touque! It's worth it!"}

{"text":"C'était délicieux! Montreal gives NYC a run for its money in fine dining. My friends and I were on vacation in Montreal, so we decided to treat ourselves to one meal at one high end restaurant. We came for lunch on 5/4/17. My friend Fiona chose this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. Our server was excellent. The bread & butter starter was wonderful. We each had the prix-fixe lunch menu - appetizer, main, dessert and coffee. My starter was the excellent confit arctic char and my main halibut was cooked perfectly. The others at my table ordered the duck magret and braised lamb shank. For dessert, we had the chocolate and miso tartlet and the pink pepper meringue and gel. I liked both desserts but one of my friends wasn't so fond of the miso tartlet. Perhaps too much miso.  Clientele were business suits, so we felt a little out of place. Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"Very elegant restaurant with good French food. Ranked as No. 1 in Canada for couple of years, this restaurant's price was however reasonable. The lamb shank came with a surprisingly big portion, not Michelin class but overall was great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, and absolutely worth it. The wine pairings really did compliment the food, and the food was exquisite."}
{"text":"Service is not bad, food is nice, worth the price. 
Their tasting menu surprised me, honestly.
Still remember the sea urchin appetizer and their dessert.
Really nice try to having a romantic date with peace and enough private. 
Anyways, this is a delay comment, nothing about V-Day menu if they have."}
{"text":"The Marlene Dietrich of restaurants: arrogant, overrated, more foam than substance. Should be called Toque? Avoid"}
{"text":"We went for dinner to celebrate both our birthdays. Food was nothing short of amazing and unique. Service was nothing like I've had before, and the waiters were kind to describe all the dishes and answered all the questions we had. I would definitely recommend this place, especially to those who have just arrived in Montreal/Quebec. They do a sublime job of presenting their province with class."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations for the food, service, and the price.  

I had the seven course tasting menu (115$), which required the whole table to participate. (There are also options to order individual entrees and appetizers). The tasting menu is also a surprise.

Here are a few points....

1. The restaurant itself it elegant without appearing too stilted or stuffy. The wine cellar serves as a beautiful centerpiece.
2. The tasting menu was quite good, but it is something you should approach with caution for 2 reasons: 1. If you do tasting menus, sea snails, fois gras terrine, bone marrow, duck hearts, etc., won't come as all that big of a surprise. 2. If you don't, these things may not suit your palate.
3. I had a scallops dish and a sea snails dish that were the best two courses. The cheese plate was unfocused, and the squash ice cream for dessert was high on surprise, but a bit lower on delicious. The bone marrow was better than any I have had, but part of me hopes the bone marrow craze passes soon.
4. The service was befitting of a fine restaurant. The only snags came later in the meal when my table was only offered coffee half way through dessert and not offered after dinner drinks.

Would I go back? Yes. However, I might skip the tasting menu."}
{"text":"Toque has been on my to do list for ages so I was happy to snag a spot for 6 people at 6 pm during the MTL a Table event. The menu, set at 71$, included several choices for the appetizer, main and dessert. There was an amuse bouche and an extra dessert plate offered at the end of the meal, so a total of 7 courses; not a bad deal! 

We were warmly welcomed at the entrance, gave our coats and were seated at our table where we were immediately allowed to peruse the menu and wine selection. Our waiter explained it all, suggested the perfect wine for us all and the feast began; plate after plate of perfectly executed dishes, great layers of flavour and textures, and by far, the most delicious combinations. Most of us ended up also ordering the single oyster with lingonberry infusion, on top of our tuna amuse bouche, which was awesome! I went for the wine pairing with my meal, and also went for the foie gras terrine as my first course for an extra cost and was so glad I did! My main was the Icelandic bass cooked to perfection and I especially loved the celeriac purée and perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes. The show stopper was the dessert for me, a perfect sphere of dark chocolate filled with a milk chocolate mousse and raspberry gelée over caramel and chocolate granola; outstanding and beautiful presentation. 

The service was at a perfect pace allowing to fully enjoy out meal. Our bread basket was always full and I especially liked the attention to detail: you left your seat, and your napkin was folded on your seat when you returned. If that wasn't enough, when one of us ran out to feed the meter, they took notice and covered the food with a cloche! Classy!!

I absolutely adored my experience at this reputable restaurant and I'm so looking forward to returning for the full menu and wine!"}
{"text":"I had such High expectation for Toqué! and I was so excited to go but it wasn't as good as I tough. maybe It was because we went for lunch but I feel it shouldn't be the case for a restaurant with this kind of reputation. We were quickly seated with a very warm welcome. The service was impeccable, the wine list is impressive and everyone seemed exceptionally professional. However, the let down was in the food.
I had some cheese gnocchi that overall tasted like mac'n Cheese. It wasn't elevated nor well structured. Quite plain. My boyfriend's fish was slightly overcooked.  
I feel like this was a bad day or something I will definitely try it again and I hope my mind will be blown this time."}
{"text":"It was truly a great gastronomical adventure, but with several imperfections. 
First, obviously you have to reserve before coming here, but it was a nightmare. I tried calling several time but they kept telling me that they don't have any availabilities. Therefore, I monitored OpenTable for days and finally got a Friday night reservation at 5:30. 
Recommendation: book through OpenTable!
Upon arrival, the waiter/usher did not gave us a warm welcome, they kept looking at us. Yes, we are young and dressing informal but they should still have the best attitude in the world considering their price tag. 
After got seated, we both got the Valentine pre-set menu with black truffle for $155 each. I got an extra glass of white wine. 
The meal started with two kinds of bread with butter. I prefer warm bread but their cold bread were fine. 
2nd, a breadstick wrapped with prosciutto, simple but tasty. 
3rd, scallop with blood orange in cucumber water. The combination of flavour was unreal, it was the most fresh any food could have!
4th, lobster, my boyfriend really liked it, the texture was amazing. 
5th, foie gras pate with bread cubes. It had a creamy texture and really captured the essence of goose liver. I used to think au pied de cochron has the best foie gras in town, this dish really challenged my perception. 
6th, veal. OMG, my favourite dish of the night. It was so juicy and tender, so well executed with the perfect amount of seasoning. 
7th, quail. My boyfriend hated it because it was served medium rare. I loved it because usually quail doesn't any specific taste, but the chef here managed to bring out the taste of quail. It was kind of like chicken but more tender. 
8th, cheese and yogurt. I like that they served these for variety but I don't really eat cheese in my daily life and can't really judge it, but the sauce that came with the dish was a great compliment to the yogurt. 
9th and 10th are the desserts, I like neither. The predessert tasted like toothpaste and I don't like mousse as dessert in general. Oh, they also gave us chocolate in the end, they were good. 
The waiter who served the dishes was very knowledgeable and patient, explained every single dish. 
However, sometimes the waiter forgot to fill up our water. 
Overall, I'm really glad I finally dined at this great restaurant after hearing so much about it. 
It was a great way to start our valentines weekend."}
{"text":"I was going to take off one star for some small service issues but really they were tiny!  One thing that irked me is when we got up to use the restroom no one came over to fold our napkins.  Poor form!  And just a few other things but they recognized the mistakes.  The napkins I don't think they noticed.
Anyhow!  This place is pretty fantastic.  I was thinking it has the whimsy of Graham Elliot and the execution of Les Nomades.  (if you're from Chicago you'll get that that's high praise)  Its not stuffy even though its not a casual restaurant.
We each started with a cocktail and they were refreshing!  
We all got the 7 course chef tasting with wine pairings.  Mine was different b/c I don't eat pork or beef.  They were extremely accommodating!!
If I went through all 7 plus amuse this would be the longest review in history.  I don't think there was a forgettable dish or wine pairing!  The wines were in a class of their own.  Just astounding.  I think my favorite things were the sauce on my halibut - it was like buttered popcorn - in a good way.  The urchin and wine pairing were superb!!  The final dessert with ice shavings and ice cream!  I would never had ordered that.  It sounds crazy but it was oh so good.
If I were ever in Montreal again I would make sure to come here.  Its classy and elegant while still being whimsical.  I can forgive the small service blunders for that!"}
{"text":"When my fiance said \"we should go to Montreal for dinner\" I knew I was marrying the right person, but more importantly I had to find an epic dinner place!! I of course searched Yelp, and asked my bestie who is from Montreal and pretty much knew Toque was gonna be the place.

Reservation was made way in advance, for 9pm, since the only earlier option was 6pm.  Btw, we did arrive early around 8:15pm to grab a drink and they sat us immediately.  

First thing off the bat - the ambiance.  For me, it just didn't work.  I couldn't quite tell what theme they were going for, and overall it felt a bit off putting.  But no worries, the food and service more than made up for.

I must say the service was great.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable, and I felt they made the experience that much better.  As we did the TASTING MENU with 7 WINE PAIRINGS it was great to see how enthusiastic everyone was about the pairings and some of the hard to find / unique wines they had chosen.  

From what I understand the menu changes frequently, so it's probably not worth me going in to depth on the tasting menu, but I will highlight some of my favorites, and misses.

SNOW CRAB - This was course 2 or 3 for us.  It was delightful.  So fresh, so light, perfect texture.  I could have eaten this all night. 

UNI - I went with the uni, and he went with the foie gras.  His was better. Mine was just strange.

LAMB - I think because it was Easter weekend this dish was added in.  WAY too salty for me and I couldn't finish it.  

GOAT CHEESE - One of the two desserts, and I loved it.  Again, perfect texture with all the different plated elements, as well as beautiful! 

I truly wish I had taken pictures of the wine bottles, we had everything from an ORANGE WINE (not flavor, this is a type and apparently it has a huge following now!) to some locally made MONTREAL WINE."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place a lot.  Food was very good quality and in line with my expectations.  Service was good.  Ended up being about $600 for the seven course menu for two including some cocktails, coffee, tips, and wine.  I enjoyed the duration of the dinner, which gave me time to stay hungry for some of the deserts!

Food was really well plated and some really strong dishes.  Would recommend

I think the atmosphere, interior wasn't quite on par with the food."}
{"text":"Wouhou ! C'est tellement malade comme restaurant, je pourrais en parler pendant des heures ! Nous avons eu la chance de l'essayer en profitant de leur promotion pour les 30 ans et moins ! C'est vraiment une belle opportunité pour ceux qui ont un budget serré, mais qui aiment la haute gastronomie ! 

Le menu était sous forme de dégustation et puisque j'etais enceinte ils ont adapté le mien sans problème et les 7 plats servis etaient aussi bons les uns que les autres! 

Je me sens prévilégiée d'avoir pu goûter à la cuisine du Toqué, je vous le conseille fortement !!"}
{"text":"Bottom line- excellent French, fine dining experience. Would go again!

Had reservations at 530pm so the place just opened and we stopped by after walking around the town for a couple of hours. The host gave me the raised eyebrow since I was underdressed in my untucked button-down and torn jeans, but to his credit- didn't say a word. We we taken to a section out of sight (likely due to my clothes) and the fun began.

Excellent wine selection- we chose a bottle and gave the menu a gander. We ordered the foie gras, lobster, and thinly sliced lamb.  All were spectacular!

The main course followed- rib eye with fennels and duck with asparagus.... both were outstanding and worth the wait.

The dessert... was a creation I can't truly describe. The olive oil and almond cake had so many things going on but came together well- especially with black coffee!

Our waiter, Samuel, was knowledgeable and funny without being overly so. He guided us well during our journey. Dinner here will run you about $500 but it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This place gave me a whole new perspective on molecular gastronomy. I'd had it before, but never executed quite this well. I was a little skeptical of all the great reviews, but this place lived up to its acclaim. 

This was one of the few Montreal restaurants on Open Table, so reservations were a snap. This is also one of the more elegant restaurants I've dined at in Montreal, so I'd recommend dressing up a bit. 

We got the 7 course tasting menu, along with the vintage wine pairing (there were two wine pairing options, vintage and regular). 

Amuse: Tangerine juice, served in a shot glass, topped with fir foam. 
First course: Scallop served in the shell, with apple foam & cranberry water. Wine pairing: 1998 macon late harvest chardonnay
Second course: Monkfish liver with sake gelée and organic soy sauce. Wine pairing: 1993 soave
Third course: Seared foie gras with chili jelly, groundcherry, daikon, apple water, sugar/salt on flower petal. Wine pairing: 1996 sauternes.
Fourth course: Chicken topped with a sheet of homemade pasta with green onion oil. Wine pairing: 1996 Morgon beaujolais.
Fifth course: Venison with elderberries, red pepper chips, garlic, root vegetables, brussels sprouts, Wine pairing: 1970 Rioja Faustino (bottled in 1974).
Sixth course: Cheese plate with melted local cheese, homemade potato chips, pine nuts, red bell peppers, quince. (Wine pairing: didn't come with the tasting menu but we got a N.V. aged Tokai)
Seventh course: Baked cored apple with apple sherbet, coconut/sour cream powder, cranberry reduction. 

Needless to say, it was a pretty impressive dinner. The colors and presentation of each dish were a work of art to behold, as well as to taste. The service was impeccable throughout the evening; the kind of service where your every need is anticipated. At one point a busser poured tap water into our sparkling water glasses, and even though it wasn't that big a deal our server immediately noticed and whisked those glasses away, bringing out a new bottle of sparkling water. Of all the meals we had on our last trip, this is one of the ones that was the most haunting; days later I'd still be thinking about some aspect of this meal. Montreal has so many excellent restaurants, so this is yet another one that is worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Went here after propossing to my now fiancée and had an incredible experience from start to finish. The oysters are the best we've ever had.  Consider the cheese to start even though it's on the dessert menu. BLT is a must. Duck margret and heart were very well put together and great for sharing. The pink peppercorn canolo and complimentary dessert bites finished the evening off perfectly. A congratulation card from the toqué team was a classy touch. Truly a 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Took the discovery wine menu with our valentine's day dinner and it was a culinary adventure like no other from there. Kudos to the staff for their excellence and passion in doing the service."}
{"text":"I wanted Toqué to be the next addition to my top 5 tasting menu experiences - so I went in with no bias, only the highest expectations, and to celebrate a special occasion. Here's why it gets 3 stars:

Food: My partner and I had the 7 course tasting menu. One of the beginning courses was interesting - sea scallops served in oyster shells, cucumber juice and a dash of rhubarb. One of the 2 desserts was also interesting and scores fairly well- chamomile sorbet and foam , with a custard like roll and buckwheat crumble. Everything else was regrettably forgettable. In addition their approach to accommodating my partners pescatarianism was appalling for such a well rated restaurant - they merely substituted dishes which contained meat with a piece of fish. Having been fortunate to have had some really stellar meals in my life, I think I can safely say that a chef worth their salt wouldn't simply replace fish in a dish built around a piece of meat. Food gets a 3.

Service: We waited about 5 minutes before anyone even approached us (after being seated). That aside service was good - efficient and friendly. (Some evidently still in training servers could use some more training but that was more endearing than annoying). Service gets 4 stars.

Decor: To each his own but for me the decor was in poor taste and a little confused in parts - large awkward wine cellar like structure in the middle, a wooden reindeer of sorts in one corner, and mirrors above some of the seating. That said the room was large and didn't feel crowded or sound noisy which was nice. I give decor a 2.

Overall (mostly weighted on the food): I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu for the price or the experience. It wasn't bad, but that's not what you look for when you shell out the $$$.I can't speak for the a la carte."}
{"text":"Nous avons eu la chance d'avoir une réservation dernière minute- une table s'étant libérée à la dernière minute dans le cadre de MTL à table. 

Il est 20h30 et il fait littéralement un froid de canard à l'extérieur. Nous nous engouffrons vite dans l'entrée. L'accueil est gentil, mais un peu coincé. 

- Vous venez pour MTL à table?
-Euh... Oui, c'est ça! 
Pas trop sûre de ce que cette question veut dire exactement...

Un serveur nous accompagne à notre table. Nous passons près du superbe cellier. La déco est moderne et le restaurant est é-nor-me! Nous nous retrouvons dans le coin. Au moins, c'est intime! 

Le serveur nous apporte le menu, que nous avions vu sur le site Internet, donc pas de surprise. Nous commandons. Pas d'apéritif pour nous, mais de l'eau minérale maison. Mon chéri demande la carte des vins, malheureusement, le serveur a compris que nous ne voulions pas de vin et il enlève les coupes. Problème de communication. Chéri n'est pas très content. Ça commence bien mal!

Surprise: on nous apporte un amuse-bouche. Pommes avec huile d'argan, sucre et sel. Le mélange est surprenant et bon. C'est la première fois que je goûte à de l'huile d'argan!

Les entrées arrivent rapidement: moi, omble confit brûlé, choux braisés. Chéri, caille. La présentation est superbe et tout est délicieux. Le mélange des textures et des goûts est parfait, savamment étudié. Chéri est déçu de ne pas avoir eu le vin en même temps que les entrées.

Enfin, le serveur nous apporte la carte des vins et nous commandons un vin rouge espagnol. Il est très doux en bouche et très bon avec notre plat principal: magret de canard et confit, pommes de terre mousseline et betterave. Encore une fois, la présentation est merveilleuse et tout est parfait. Le magret est cuit à point, le confit est croustillant, la betterave est tendre et sucrée et la purée est liquide et servie... dans un bol! Étonnant contraste de textures et de saveurs. Une petite sauce fruitée que je soupçonne être aux bleuets accompagne bien la viande.

En finale, le dessert: moi, mousse de courge et glace à la courge. Chéri, tarte aux pommes, glace au sucre à la crème. Mon dessert est peu sucré et goûte vraiment la courge. Des graines de citrouille ajoute un petit côté croquant. J'aime bien. La tarte aux pommes est définitivement plus sucrée et bien bonne. Pour clôturer ce superbe repas, un espresso déca pour mon chéri et moi, une tisane à la verveine. 

Je donne quatre étoiles parce que le service était gentil, mais pas extraordinaire. Était-ce le fait que nous participions à MTL à table et que nous avions un menu à 39$ par personne? Par contre, les plats étaient splendides et originaux. Tout est frais et on voit que le chef  travaille avec les produits de saison ET québécois. 

L'ambiance est chic, mais pas guindée, style complet-cravate. Mais, il faut dire qu'on est mercredi soir. Peut-être que la clientèle est plus chic un samedi soir? Je ne sais pas... Une chose est certaine, il n'y avait pas de jeans troués!"}
{"text":"US California review here !

Okay, let's get straight to the point. This IS a fancy smancy dinner spot. They do that thing where they run a piece of silverware to clean your table after you eat to keep the table cloth free of crumbs. You know you're going to pay when someone does that! On a serious note, it is like $50-60 a plate so it's not THAT bad. 

Was the food worth it? Hellz yeah. The bread was bleh. Nothing earth shattering about it. I ate my entrees plate clean. I ordered the guinea howl which was delicious. Wife ordered the duck which was also darn good. We finished off with a dessert I can't remember or probably pronouncements. Apparently it was a piece of a dessert at our wedding. Haha. Oops. 

Anyways, everything was delicious. I uploaded photos with the dishes name (except the dessert). Take a look at it if you're thinking of ordering it. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This was the high point of our day trip to Montreal. Not only is the presentation beautiful, but they put the same care into their service and the taste of the food. This is a must if you are in Montreal! and you enjoy French cuisine!"}
{"text":"We had a la carte menu. The service was excellent. Good wine selection. Lamb tartare was impressive. My bluefin tuna loin was well executed with thoughtful ingredients. The rest of my dining parties found their dishes rather average. Definitely not at the levels of other fine dining experiences we had elsewhere, especially for the price they charge. Running out of options for main courses was disappointing not to mention the replacement was not impressive at all. 
Wondering how they'd stay competitive in such fiercely competitive world of fine restaurants. 
We felt no need to come back."}
{"text":"TLDR: Delicious food, fantastic service, great experience.

Toqué delivers a fantastic dining experience every time you go. The lunch and dinner menu deliver diverse options for all palates and will definitely wet your appetite. The only drawback is that you will be stuck debating about which menu item should you choose. The servers are professional and contribute to the overall amazing dining experience. Toqué is without a doubt the restaurant to go to for an incredible restaurant experience in Montreal."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to come but was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar without waiting. Had the 7 course tasting menu which was absolutely amazing. I was gonna say \"especially the appetizer (sry I forgot its name..)\" but everything just gets better and better. The waiting time between main dishes is kinda long tho
Service was great 
10/10 would come back so I asked how often do they change the tasting menu and here's what the waiter told me: everyday. if I were to come again tmr, they'll totally change every course for me."}
{"text":"It's been a while between visits: my last one must have been around 2000, when I lived in NYC and the restaurant must have been only a few years old.  I can only hope I age as well as the restaurant has, serving top-notch haute cuisine in great atmosphere 16 years later.  

Lots of space between tables makes you feel like you have the place to yourselves, and highlights the differences between Toque and other Montreal temples of gastronomy like Joe Beef (which you can wear sneakers to and be practically in your neighbor's lap, but where the food also excels).

As is the case in Europe, for me the tasting menu ($122) was the way to go, offering several of the menu items to experience the chef's range, at a good pace, and with wine pairings (5 for $80-ish) that were obviously given a lot of thought.  Despite the high calibre of the restaurant, there are a lot of bottles of wine at reasonable prices - a quick look identified several in the $50s, or even $40s, and a table of 4 could actually buy a magnum (a double bottle - $180) for almost half the price of the wine pairing for 4, but then of course then it wouldn't pair with everything as well.

After our amuse (not pictured, but it was a pretzel with a dip today), we had several dishes that are hard to describe given the number of ingredients, but like other reports here on Yelp, ours included the sea urchin sabayon (\"oursin\"), northern shrimp with yuzu (hard to see in the photo, as it's covered with a round slice of radish or root), the pan-seared foie gras that I'd been longing for the entire trip, veal, duck, a goat cheese and yoghurt course, and a chocolate dessert.  7 wonderful courses.

Toque is the perfect restaurant to enjoy a quiet meal, a romantic meal, or one where you want or need to converse with those at your table or discuss that multi-billion-dollar M&A deal.  If you didn't pack dress shoes and just want to eat some great food with a beer, Joe Beef/Liverpool House is the place for that.  Fortunately on my weekend in Montreal, I got to do all 3... and now need to eat salad for a week."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable, food was delicious. The pace of the meal was slow and steady which gave us ample time to discuss the dishes and the experience. This was a great date night; we felt special from the second we walked in the door. Definitely go here if you can swing it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The 7 course chef's tasting menu was an experience like no other. The chef was obviously a world class artist and one incredible dish seamlessly transitioned into the next. The service was professional and attentive in a way that did not overshadow the beauty of the dishes being served to us. I briefly mentioned my gluten sensitivity and with a quick nod the server said \"not at all a problem\" and I was taken care of from there without another word. The sommelier was knowledgable and entertaining sharing stories about each glass of wine he paired with our courses. We were absolutely floored by the flavour in each dish. Was it cheap? No. Was it worth every penny to go on a 3 hour journey of the senses? Absolutely."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be the best restaurant in Montreal. Or at least the best from what I researched and found. So we were excited to secure a reservation (albeit a pretty late one) on our weekend trip here.

Food was good, not phenomenal. I had the foie gras tasting dinner while he had the regular tasting. Silly me, I requested for the foie in the form of a terrine instead. The chef was able to accomodate my request and I enjoyed the terrine (thinking back now, I wonder if I made the right decision to swap...) but later on in the tasting, I somehow felt that the taste of dishes seem similar to that of the terrine (probably because he used the same ingredients e.g. strawberries etc). He said I can't really judge it since I requested  a swap... perhaps I should have stuck to the original menu. Oh well. 

I'm not a big fan of their squab. The meat itself it too gamey for me. However, I did enjoy dinner here. My very first tasting! We spent a bomb here that night. I offered to split but he took on the entire bill. So sweet."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner, party of three. Seated promptly.

Service: 
7/10 - Went to restroom twice, napkin never folded. Told waiter Kobe beef was tough, he just went away. Asked about the pasta dish, I said it was a tad salty, went away again.

Decor: 
9/10 looks awesome, well done

Food: 
3/10 - Nothing memorable, had to send steak back, asked if they had a better cut, perhaps we had a bad section of the loin, but was told no, it's all like that. Wow, I showed the waiter how impossible it was to separate the meat with a fork and knife. They asked if they could replace with another dish, which came out too salty.

Wine & Alcohol
7/10 - Great list of wines, good local roster if beers as well.

Price Point
1/10 - bill for party of three was 510$ which is pretty high, I never mind unless the food is sub-par which Toque! was.

I will NOT be returning, fool me once shame on me, fool me twice..."}
{"text":"Would give this place 10 stars if I could!  I've eaten at many good restaurants in Montreal (Moishes, Queue de Cheval, Grain de Sel, Pied de cochon...etc) but this one outshines them all!  Food, service, ambiance outstanding!"}
{"text":"....was disappointed after hearing a lot of hype about the place BUT only had lunch a few times there and yet to have enjoyed dinner.  At that price the service was too stand-offish and there was an air of \"specialness\" there-- thats fine, but the food should be a good pair with the attitude.."}
{"text":"We had high expectations from all the reviews on Yelp.  The decor is modern and comfortable.  However this does not make up for the food.  My wife and I had the tasting menu with Fois Gras.  A this point I think I have sub-consciously blocked all the dishes from memory. Yes, it was that bad.  I give the restaurant one star for trying to be creative with food, but at the end of the day it has to taste great.

With all the other great restaurants in Montreal, you should only go here if you cannot get a table anywhere else. 

I don't like giving negative reviews but I wish there were more for Toque on Yelp before we went."}
{"text":"This elegant place is widely  considered the best restaurant in Montreal. It certainly is one of the most expensive. My wjfe is an adventurous eater, and this place is adventurous. Try not to laugh when they bring out the 1st course. A 1/10th ounce of green fluid that I could not get into the baby spoon they provided. Each of the 7 courses after that were similarly, shockingly tiny. I am sure that these dishes were tasty, but the amount served seemed to slip between my taste buds, so I couldn't say. The main, main course consisted of the fattiest 2 ounce piece of Lamb I have ever tasted. The last 2 dessert courses were very delicious, however, if I were you, I'd skip dropping $400.00 at this place and just go for Gelato."}
{"text":"Toque is the best restaurant in Canada. There-- I said it, and I await the rebuttals. Bring it on! 

Granted, my only meal here was over 5 years ago, but I dream about the salad I had here. Yes, the salad. (And I don't normally dream about food, either.) It was simple, it was evenly dressed, and it was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. I really wish I could talk about the other items I ate, but everything else has been overshadowed by that delicious, perfect salad. 

Toque emphasizes creativity. Looking at their recent a la carte menu, have you imagined serving caramelized mackerel with maple syrup? How about tuna belly with raspberry vinagrette? Sounds intriguing and guaranteed to be heavenly. I'd highly suggest getting the chef's 7 course tasting menu, as there will be even more creativity and suprises awaiting in each dish. In addition, Toque showcases their local suppliers. All of their food is locally grown/produced. 

You'd think Toque comes with a hefty price tag, but it doesn't. The 7 course tasting menu (without wine pairings) comes in at $92 Canadian dollars, or $87 USD. Can you believe that? 

Toque is definitely worth a trip to the lovely city of Montreal. If you come to Montreal without a visit to Toque, just realize you are missing out on THE best meal of your life from Canada's best restaurant."}
{"text":"Charming and fun restaurant for lunch. I wish the menu had been a little bit more flexible/responsive - it was a cold, wet day outside and everyone (including our server) wished there was soup on the menu! Normally I trust a menu but this one seemed surprisingly out of touch!

However, the options were quite delicious and I really loved the half or full glass of wine pairing for each course. In fact, for me they transformed the food from good to great, and the pairings were really interesting. For both courses, when I tasted the wine by itself, I thought it was fine, but the combinations with food were excellent.

The atmosphere was pleasantly not too formal and our servers were charming and at ease with our purely english interactions."}
{"text":"We tried their tasting menu with duck liver. It's really good for the first time. Better make a reservation before the visit. The serve is good and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life.  It's in the same league as French Laundry, Le Bernardin, etc."}
{"text":"Great food and wine pairings. 7 course meal was exquisite. Still recall the snow-crab, which simply amazing. However the service left a lot to be desired. Server assigned to our table was not helpful in making any recommendations."}
{"text":"Expensive and perfect.  I was at Toque a few years ago, and it blew my mind.  There are dishes that are hard to reproduce, and you are treated like royalty.  At $300-500 per couple, you expect nothing less.

This is a once a year or every few year experience for us.  It is about perfection, and the waiters (who seem to outnumber the guests) make sure that you get perfection.  They clear everything between each dish (and we had 7 tastings).  They also explain the dishes in a way that is scripted.  

The food is so creative, I don't know where to begin, but some of these dishes obviously require huge preparation and special equipment.  I felt like I was a visiting chef on a food show, and they were doing this just for me.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience both food and service that is over-the top.  Save up and go - but it will set you back - be prepared."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks as comfortable and elegant as ever.  The new bar is pretty, but I think it's mostly good for decor.  The service this time lacks a bit of attention, perhaps because they are very busy.  I sat at the sofa against the wall, and had enjoyed my usual view of the wine cellar and most of the restaurant.  With an old familiar feeling of comfort, dinning alone here is quite pleasant.  For starters, the bread was as usual, not warm.  But it had taste...from the wheat or butter I don't know.  But it had TASTE.  The tasting menu started with tomato puree with some herbs - okay starter.  The lobster with foam of corn is absolutely stunning.  I can still taste the corn and lobster right now. The Fois Gras is thick, juicy and as usual, head and shoulders above any others I have tried.  The sea snail salad provided a sharp contrast between the snail and veggie.  Ribeye carpacio is okay as I am not into carpacio, but I give them an A for effort as there is at least 10 ingredients that went into the rest of the dish.  The meat was pigeon (squab?), which had a very tender breast.  The most memborable thing was the curled up claw on my plate.  I skipped the cheese for a salad, which was absolutely divine.  It had a citreous taste that was remarkable.  Again, there is taste is in every little dish.  The dessert is the usual pretty Toque style.  Finished with Oolong, which is very taiwanese in quality, quite rare to find such good tea in N. America.  This place has been an exceptional restaurant since they were on St. Dennis.  After 8 years, and many fine restauranI ts later, it remained the top restuarant on my list in which I judge all others against, as I collect Michellin stars.  I only wish I can one day gather my whole family to Montreal to share the spetacular food in this wonderful place together."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unbelievable. It was by far the best 7 course meal I have ever eaten. Every single course melted in my mouth. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want top of the line fine dining! Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. I don't know if I'll ever be to another restaurant better than this.

The decor and ambiance was modern, nothing to talk much of. Clean and simple. Service was very professional.

The food was brilliant. We had the Tasting Menu and left $500 lighter for two, but it was worth it. The dinner was not just a meal, but a while experience. Very creative food with complex flavors and textures, but still very accessible for most people. 

Wow, I hope to go to Montreal again someday so that I can go to Toque again."}
{"text":"Pretty good and creative food. The shrimp appetizer and halibut entree were exceptional. Not for large parties, though. We had nearly 20, with a limited menu (choice of three for appetizers, entree, and dessert). The options we're good, but the service was just plain bad."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  Extremely knowledgeable wine connoisseur! We enjoyed every story he told us about every wine!
The tasting menu was great, but only one dish wowed me, the foie gras!  A very generous piece of foie gras served perfectly!  The rest of the dishes were consistently good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Def one of the more creative restaurants in the city. I loved what they did esp with the razor clam appetizer but thought they went a bit over board with the dessert. The main course was solid but I'm not 5 star about it. I think I prefer Bouillon Bilk or Tuckshop for main course. 

Though I have to say that the service and real estate space for sitting is exceptional. They don't cramp you up next to your neighbors."}
{"text":"Food tha t is art. Art that is sublime. Service that is flawless. Decor which is cutting edge trendy. 

It doesn't get better."}
{"text":"Being a native, I credit Montreal (and my family of course) with instilling in me, a profound love of good food and good drink. Back in town, I wanted to try all the good food that I'd been missing like yummy Greek and Lafleur's hot dogs. Also on my list was haute cuisine and this place's name came up. I took my sister and, well, it was very very good. While we both had the tasting menu, mine was the foie gras version and my sister's was the regular version. It was a whirlwind of escalating expectations as it started off with a fantastic amuse bouche (a mousse topped with a foam...I can't remember the ingredients...I should have taken notes!). Then the courses just kept getting better until the 4th course (or was it 5th?) which was a salmon foie gras. At that point, I was wishing I had gotten the regular tasting menu because my sister had a tuna sashimi type dish which was definitely better. While it may just be that by that point, I had foie gras fatigue but the salmon dish was not pleasing...it wasn't bland but it wasn't spectacular. The next dish was a braised bone marrow...super yum! By this point though, I was stuffed! I didn't think I could go on but the deliciousness of the food (and it's price...$104 for the foie gras tasting menu, $92 for the regular tasting menu) made me go on. Unfortunately, the dessert was absolutely dreadful. It was juvenile and pedestrian, to say the least. The dessert was a thin wafer over ice cream topped with little dots of jam (mine was strawberry, my sister's was blueberry). It was kinda shocking to see and taste the dessert because it was almost like a joke...like \"you'll come here to eat anything I serve\". The dessert should have capped the night but it felt like more of an insult. 

One particular note of appreciation I would give is to the sommelier who developed the wine pairings with such precision that the food was absolutely enhanced by it. I know that that's the point of a wine pairing but I've never had one that was just this perfect before...it turned a solo into a symphony. The wine pairing is completely worth the price (I had the $60 \"regular\" pairing...there is a $90 \"premium\" pairing as well).

Overall, there were a few bad notes which made the price seem overly high. The price should have been under $100 for the foie gras and $85 for the regular tasting menu. However, this was haute cuisine that was, for the most part, done very well. This place takes cards. There is street parking so save your money and forgo the valet. Perhaps I've been spoiled by LA but valet is crazy-expensive in Montreal. There is a complimentary coat check."}
{"text":"WOW ! ! this is a great restaurant and if you have some extra money-- Restaurant Toque' should be on the top of the list. We happen to get the three course meal for a great price of $69.00 (only during one week in November ). Nice bottle of wine recommended by the bartender, Gilbert, and poof we were hooked. Thanks for one of the best meals ever !"}
{"text":"Upon visiting Montreal I, true to form, did a lot of research on which restaurants we should eat at. Toque repeatedly came up on 'must try' lists so my boyfriend and I decided to take the first open reservation on a Saturday night (6:30). There were no other reservations until after 9pm, but when we walked in the restaurant was almost totally empty. As soon as I saw that there was a 7-course tasting menu I knew why the reservations were so spaced apart -- the whole experience takes a few hours.

And of course we couldn't resist the mysterious tasting menu, which gave no hint at to what the chef would be creating except that there would be foie gras. Overall, the food was exceptional -- 5 stars from start to finish. Some highlights for me were:

- The seared tuna soup -- hot tomato water was poured at the table and lightly cooked the tuna
- The foie gras course, served with berries, peas, a flaky cornbread and a pink sugar-salt mixture
- The main dish, which was a unique play on 'surf & turf' highlighting perfectly moist chicken, mussels and eel

I was so impressed with the food, but there were some hiccups with service and the environment that brings my review down to 4 stars. People pay a lot for tasting menus, and you want the atmosphere to be on the same level as the food. For some reason that night there were kids running around the restaurant being loud and distracting. The kitchen was fairly loud, and our service seemed to either be REALLY on (our water glasses were always filled, the servers were incredibly nice and excited about the food) or really off (it took FAR too long to get the check, there was some confusion about the cocktails offered). 

All in all, Toque is worth a visit simply for the food. I can't speak to the regular menu but the tasting menu was truly a wonderful treat."}
{"text":"This is a place every french food lover must try in Montreal. Such creative high end cuisine in a modern eclectic sophisticated restaurant. 

First, I had green and white aspargus with pancetta and parmesan cheese as an appetizer. Aspargus were perfectly cooked. These were followed by the atlantic halibut, which was just amazing.

Highlight of the night was the wine. I asked the sommelier for something unique and he brought me a white 1989 Jura. I was first totally absorbed with the nose and then the tasting notes. A wine that I'll probably always remember and that was perfectly paired with the fish. 

As dessert, we tried the kalingo chocolate moelleux and the honey pound cake. They were absolutely delicious!

Cheers Toqué!"}
{"text":"Our server Karen was attentive to my dietary restrictions as a pregnant lady and offered pleasant service to us even though we placed a funny order. The amuse bouche was delectable and rather large (I am used to soup spoon size not app size). My butter and bread were tasty, which is what I have been looking forward to on this trip. 

My husband enjoyed 2 oysters with citrus granita followed by a first course of venison carpaccio and sea snails (large enough for 2-3 to share). I enjoyed the suckling porn loin main dish, hubs had the duck breast and heart, and MIL had the gazpacho (from first course section) as her main.  So much food! 

The desserts were lovely, though at the price, I probably should have shared or skipped. The petite fours were a blueberry pastry almost like a mini muffin and a brown suagr fudge. I liked eating them in the same bite. Will definitely reccomend and return. Reasonably priced fine dine, not too noisy but not too stuffy. Glad we skipped the 7 course and did ala carte per another reviewer's suggestion."}
{"text":"Amazing. Delicious. Delightful. Service outstanding. What you would expect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My fiancé proposed to me here so this restaurant has a lot of meaning for us! My fiancé had the scallops appetizer and was impressed, but only because he was expecting something different. These were served as though they were oysters.
I had an artichoke soup with a mousse and hazelnuts and it was delicious!! For the main course, he had the venison loin and he loved it! I had the artic char and it was delicious ! For dessert he had the cocoa waffle and it he liked it a lot! I had the maple syrup yogurt with caramel and it was amazing!! And the presentation was beautiful!!

The service was amazing! The waiter was very attentive and have us a wine suggestion, and even have us champagne to congratulate out engagement! :)"}
{"text":"In terms of food presentation and quality, I don't think it'll get better than this.

The décor was very nice on the inside, not exactly what I was expecting when I saw the exterior. You might get what I mean when you see it. 

Complimentary (and adorable) whole sea urchins and a bisque were offered when waiting for your dishes to arrive - not something I was expecting after sitting down shortly and then a little sea urchin on a plate is in front of you; a range of bread and butter was also offered.

Appetizer: their pan seared fois gras was beautiful and felt like I was eating a painting (definitely an Instagram moment). The portion might be better shared if you want to enjoy the rest of your meal. The berry vinegar reduction was a little sour for me so I tried to avoid touching that part on the canvas. Their scallops was also very fresh, definitely worth a try when it's in season.

Mains: beef rib eye was extremely tender and juicy-the shade of red was perfect and had me debating whether I should've ordered more (the bok choy was a weird pairing though). The miso puree added a nice touch while the Bordelaise sauce was also really nice, which made the dish unique. The halibut was cooked perfectly; tenderness, texture, and flavor was spot on. The colourful bed of diced veggies added a nice spark to the dish instead of it being bland and boring. However, it wouldn't be 'the dish' at this place. You might want to try the suckling pig loin instead of this one if you want something more special while you're here.

We purposely didn't order dessert because our next stop was Cacao 70; enough said if you've been there. Even so, 2 truffles were given as a treat at the end of the meal (they give out different things from time to time). 

Every dish was very detailed and felt like an art work; definitely worth the visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"I went there with very high expectations because of the rating. We tried the tasting menu, but the food didn't surprise me. In the 7 courses, only 2 or 3 that I was really satisfied."}
{"text":"\"Farm-fresh Québécois dishes & tasting menus from renowned chef Normand Laprise, plus fine wines. \"Eco friendly water, local suppliers-a culinary mastery- a place for private or large group functions, date night or general fine dining experience and large terrace. We wanted to experience this and we would suggest to always call ahead and book before coming to Montreal. Ranked Number one restaurant in Canada- we were very luck to have gotten a spot. Service was on par- we had a server that could speak both French and English and was always pleasant and very knowledgeable of the menu. We had a  sommelier speak to us about wines and was actually Impressed with the wine selection we chose ourselves :). We started off we cocktails - I can't even explain the taste- impeccable- mine was with rose water - served with a rose in it! We were offered oysters at first before our appies   But did forgo. We wanted to be sure we didn't get full on anything before the main course! We got complimentary bread which was fresh- once again I didn't have much. Our appies was a cucumber spiced seafood pate with a small breadstick! Each bit was savory. Main course- i got duck - med rare with sauté farm Fresh vegetables. My friend got lobster capellini- pasta made today only! Desert - each got one to taste and even better. They topped it off with maple fudge candy that was so soft it melted in your mouth. There was an alternate \"tasting menu with dish of the evening and wine parings but we opted to choose our own. I am sure both options would never disappoint! We were able to enjoy a 2h dinner just dining and chatting . Ambiance was elegant but warm and friendly. We got sat right by the wine display which took our vision right down to the wine cellar. 
I have been to many fine dining restaurants and I would have to agree with Canada's choice for French Cuisine!"}
{"text":"This the best restaurant we have ever experienced. 
We came last night for a desert to check it out. Wow. We had the tasting menu.  Some of the dishes were so scrumptious I felt helpless. I surrendered into appreciation. One of my wife's dishes was so formidable I could not approach a second taste. Expensive yes. But firmly on the price/ quality curve. Astoundingly great."}
{"text":"Toque was the only place that we made a reservation well in advance. It was good, there were some enjoyable dishes, but it didn't quite reach the \"otherwordly\" place that some tasting menus can hit.

I took pictures of most of the dishes in their entirety (sometimes I forgot before digging in). They have been posted. I don't exactly remember what they all were, but I'll do my best!

Drinks - They have two drinks of the day, every day. Mine involved blueberry and wintergreen as major components. On one hand, this was totally innovative and interesting. On the other, the only place I really experience wintergreen is in toothpaste, so it's hard to shake that.

Amuse - A very light, gelato-ey dish. Melty. Cold. Not remarkable, but it definitely got the ball rolling.

Bread - The bread was not a course, but I would feel badly if I did not mention that this was the best ciabatta I've ever eaten. And the little ciabatta crackers? So amazing!

Scallop - The best course of the night might have been scallop on the half shell. It was fresh, served with a little onion and oil, as well as some Asian-influenced spices. And the entire shell was sitting on a mound of salt, some of which got into your mouth when eating the scallop, which was amazing. Great presentation, great results.

Tuna - One of the most interesting dishes of the night, the tuna was kind of like a gelée stuck to the bottom of a plate. But the flavor was so rich and so good, that I quickly got over it.

Foie - The foie was very good, served with croutons, vegetables and sauce. I was so excited for it that I didn't take a picture. Use your imagination.

Mussels - Since the foie was a supplement, in its stead is usually the mussels. They were served in a similar manner to the foie. Also good.

Lamb - I think it was lamb. It basically looked and tasted like thick-cut lunch meat. Vegetables and sauce did not really help. The non-meat version of this was seared scallops, which were much better.

Duck - The main course was the duck, and like the lamb (or whatever the lunch meat was) didn't do it for me. Extremely traditional presentation, and lacking in flavor. I guess the line of fat on the duck is traditional as well, but it just seemed out of place.

Cheese - Really interesting presentation. Crumbled cheese on the wide rim of the bowl, soft cheese inside, quince, Asian radishes... Interesting stuff. Not the best, but pretty good.

Dessert - Another one whose design was a bit strange. It was kind of like a bunch of elements thrown on a plate, in a line. Berries and gelatto, and crumbles. Pretty good, but I don't think I'd ever order it on my own.

Petit Four - Or two. Macaron mini sandwiches. Light, sweet, and a good way to end the meal.

Now that I look back, the meal started really well, but ended with a whimper. A local later told me that he thought the place was slipping, and I couldn't disagree. But it wouldn't take much to get it back to a top level again."}
{"text":"Excellent! No doubt for this top 10 restaurant in Canada!  As per my request, the chef is so nice to split the two main course for us. Very appreciate! The staffs are very nice and attention to details."}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about this restaurant so I was excited when my friends took me here for my belated birthday on Tuesday. We all did the 7 course tasting menu.  FYI You don't know what you are getting ahead of time. I ordered a bloody Caesar but it was a very average Caesar. I then did the wine pairing (5 glasses). I'm really glad I did the wine pairing and made everyone try each glass. The wines were all very good!! I liked that the sommelier explained each wine in depth and gave a bit of history as to where it was from. Every time we got a different dish it was a different waiter telling us what it was... it was if they each were in charge of remembering one thing lol.  

Overall the portions were small but because their were seven courses I left feeling full and satisfied. 

Everyone got a piece of tuna on a little stone to start off. It wasn't part of the tasting menu... it was something extra but it was nothing special and just tasted like regular canned tuna.  My favorite dishes were surprisingly the fish dishes! I'm not really a fish person and I don't like when fish tastes fishy. These were not fishy at all. I probably would eat more fish it always tasted like that! The first dish was the flounder with a  mousse on top. The second dish was the arctic char with lemon, soya, ginger juice, fried seaweed and green onion. I was worried i wouldn't like it when I saw the dish but damn it was so good!

I did the tasting menu with duck foie gras. It's $136 with or without foie gras. The others chose not to have foie gras so they ended up with octopus. I did not regret my choice! I tried the octopus and it was good but I wasn't in love and I love foie gras. I prefer the grilled octopus from Milos. 
 
The meat dishes didn't blow me away like the fish dishes did. We had lamb which was my favorite of the two meat dishes. The lamb also had lamb tongue with beets. I never had lamb tongue before but it actually tasted better than the actual piece of lamb! The venison came with carrots and potato. It was a bit gamey. 

For dessert we had the choice between savory and sweet or sweet and sweet. I chose the former.  So I got the cheese platter with mustard butter and egg yolk. The cheese was very good. I wish there had been a wine to go with it but I just drank it with the wine I already had. Those who chose to stick to sweet got the bay leaf and cream brulee with cocoa and it came with like \"branch\" made of white chocolate. Both were delicious. Then we all got the last dessert which was a blueberry foam with almond and olive oil cake with a fir tree meringue and parfait with lemon cream. The blueberry foam had a bit of a weird after taste.

At the end of the night they came and gave me a birthday card and left something extra on the table that was not part of the tasting menu. They were little squares of fudge and pink peppered strawberry. My favorite was the fudge!

I recommend this restaurant for special occasions. They really do make you feel special and it is quite fancy so it's definitely not your every day restaurant."}
{"text":"The Why:  Considered by some to be the inventor if \"new Québec gastronomy\" and bestowed with Five Diamonds, Relais et Chateaux recognition, and nearly twenty years at the top of Montreal's dining scene a meal at Toque seemed like a perfect prelude to dinner at Au Pied du Cochon.  Helmed by Normand Laprise and focused strongly on local sourcing with a daily menu meant to focus on items most fresh, unique, and dazzling from the local markets I will admit I'd heard some mixed feelings on recent visits to the restaurant, but with my mother and aunt planning to save room for what was sure to be a gluttonous evening the large formal dining room seemed like a perfect place to lunch amongst the city's well-heeled and well dressed.
 

The Space:  Large and spacious with high ceilings, soft wall coverings, blond wood, and plush carpet Toque feels very serious and aside from the large metal flower marker out front it certainly is a serious restaurant with widely set tables, servers speaking in whispers, and a wine cellar focused on Canada but inclusive of all the best - many visible on a floating rack in the middle of the restaurant.

The Service:  All female during my visit and all friendly, efficient, and professional.  Perfect posture, peerless pours, and plates delivered with ample description were the norm throughout my visit and ever-present but never looming there is no doubt the team here is well trained.  More Paris than New York I will say that I am generally more comfortable with servers who show a little more personality, but all things being equal it would be hard to find fault in the team at Toque.

Bread Service:  Served in a small box with an icy puck of bland butter a trio of breads featuring a Sourdough Roll, Carraway Rye slices, and Crostini arrived first - each was fine, but the butter was largely inedible until it had rested a good twenty minutes; a pet peeve of mine.

Quinoa Salad, Squab Confit, Iceberg Lettuce, Dried Fruit:  I really don't know why I was being served iceberg lettuce in a fine dining space, but I have to say I appreciated the honesty as thin strings stood alongside razor thin radishes atop a truly impressive warm salad of toothsome quinoa, crisp and fatty squab, plus dried peaches, apricots, and plums.  A deft balance of sweet, savory, and nutty this was one of those dishes that far exceeded modest expectations handily.

Quail Confit, Brandy Sauce, Eggplant Caviar, Garlic Puree, Cabbage, Parsnip and Beet Chips:  More fowl, and this one more substantial in portion, it would be hard to imagine a more juicy bird than the whole quail set before me.  Reportedly baked in duck fat for nearly half a day and plated with vegetables in varying forms, flavors, and texture the quail itself was perfect and each accoutrement helped lead the plate in a new direction, yet unfortunately where this dish came up short for me was in the sauce - a potent reduction that threatened to overwhelm nearly everything it touched.  As an added note - crispy cabbage leaves only seem like a good idea; in reality they shatter with even the slightest touch of a fork and would have been better served as finger food.

With coffee supplied by Illy I went with an Americano and oddly it was brought out before my cheese course - but cheers to the folks at Toque, the refills were free and thus I was able to enjoy a few cups, including one with dessert, rather than suffer cool coffee.

Riopelle with Sweet Almonds, Apple Jelly, Onion Bread:  At $8 per selection the cheese board at Toque is well culled but largely international and wanting to try something local my server directed me to this - the best cheese of the trip without a doubt and seemingly uncommon in the world of Canadian cheeses in that it was quite soft, nearly liquid in the mouth.  Triple cream and intense on the first taste with a lot of fruity and earthy notes coming forth later I've since sought this out at home and also found the accoutrements to be superlative - who knew apple jam spread on onion bread could work so well?

Churros, Chocolate, Coffee Sauce:  My fault.  I have no idea why I ordered this at a place like Toque other than the fact that the other dessert options did not sound very good either.  Overcooked, over-sugared, and although the coffee sauce was good the execution was not.  Again, I don't know why I ordered it or why it was on the menu.

The Verdict:  All things being equal I think I may have cheated myself by visiting Toque at lunch - a quick glance at the dinner menu all but confirms that, but considering their stature in the Canadian culinary landscape I guess I expected a bit more of a \"yes\" attitude to something as simple as a cold foie gras prep at lunch - particularly as the restaurant was less than 1/8 full throughout my visit.  Great service, beautiful room, but aside from the quinoa salad and a cheese that can be bought elsewhere nothing truly 'wowed' me enough to say I'd go back or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We've dined in many fantastic restaurants (French Laundry, Alinea, Mugaritz, Pierre Gagnaire), and Chef Normand Laprise's Toque definitely stands among the best.  We dined here in May, 2008 and though I've been remiss in writing up a timely review, our meal here clearly and memorably stands out as a highlight not only of our trip to Montreal, but of my collective dining experience...

Service is warm and friendly - we asked to be seated by the big picture windows that look out on the colourful Palais des congrès de Montréal ...

We opted for the 7-course \"elaborate mystery menu\" - a steal back then at $92 Cdn ($156 with 5 glasses of wine).  

Some highlights:

Strawberries with scallops, macerated in orange juice. I thought this an odd combination to begin with - but the dish worked perfectly, the fruit pairing superbly with the delicate scallops, nothing overwhelmed.

Seared Foie Gras strawberry gelee and aged balsamic vinegar - the best treatment of Foie even during our Foie-heavy trip to Montreal, when we also visited that Temple of Fattened Goose Liver - Au Pied de Cochon.  The sear was perfect, the outside delicately sweetly caramelised, the interior rich and nearly molten... 

Suckling pig: uber fall-apart tender skin-on suckling pig surrounded with radishes, false morels, raw almonds & milk foam... fabulous contrasts in texture and tastes, the foam a light contrast to the richness of the pork...

We would definitely return on our next trip to Montreal..."}
{"text":"my friend and I visited toque with high expectation. We are trying to be healthier, so we decided to go for lunch. The service was very bad, and the food was extremely unsatisfying. The duck leg was paired with random vegetables which don't match and the first course was even more disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, food's quality and presentation was perfect.  It's a great place to take a business group."}
{"text":"Best of the best. Fantastic service. We had the tasting menu plus the oysters as a start. Portions are just right. The food was prepared based on some allergies. It was truly delicious and lived up to our expectations. If you are in Montreal I would say it's a must. 

The final dessert was to die for. The attention to detail is very noticeable. This is coming from someone that doesn't normally eat desserts."}
{"text":"I'd eaten at Toque! on a trip about eight years ago, and I was excited to be back!  We decided against the famous tasting menu, having indulged so much during our trip, but our server was absolutely fantastic.  He even helped pair half-glasses of wine with each course that I had, which was perfection.  I started with a champagne tasting, just to get going.

Then he paired a white wine with my foie gras starter, with apple purée, shiitake mushrooms, and buckwheat crumble; it was so rich I couldn't even finish it.  It was seriously too much!  I pretty much never eat foie gras, but I felt like I was in France and had to indulge.

My husband's dinner was a lamb dish, and it was beautifully plated!  He enjoyed it, especially all of the mushrooms used in so many of the dishes.  I had the duck magret, with hedgehog mushrooms, carrots, Tokyo turnip, borlotti bean purée, Madeira sauce.  Duck is another indulgent thing I don't get to eat very often.  This one was absolutely beautiful too.  Delicious!

For dessert, we had Peruvian chocolate dish with sorbet.  It's rotated off the menu, but I loved how it looked like bark with plants growing from it.  They do a good job with molecular gastronomy at Toqué!  It was really an incredible meal."}
{"text":"My family came here during our stay in Montreal a week ago, and we absolutely enjoyed every minute of our experience at Toque. 

The food was fantastic, both in quality and presentation. 

For the appetizer, we had the foie gras, the arctic char, the scallops, and the razor clams. Everything was fresh and exceeded our expectation. The arctic char especially was full of flavor and very fresh. Needless to say, the foie gras was the best I have ever tasted, it was so buttery and the melt-in-your-mouth texture was to die for. 

We selected the duck, striped bass, bison lion, and veal for our entree, everything was delicious, although the bison was a little bit on the dry side, it was overall a very good experience. Again, the fish wins over all the entrees, it was very fresh, moist, and flavorful, as a seafood lover, I really enjoyed the dish. 

We also had a chance to try their dessert. We ordered the strawberry souffle and the cocoa waffle. The cocoa waffle was good, but not too impressive. However, the strawberry souffle was really great. Granted that it was my first time eating souffle, it tasted great and I'd love to eat it again.

The service was also superb, and the servers was very friendly and did a great job at making suggestions and introducing the menu.

It was a memorable dining experience, and I would love to go there when I visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"stuffy and overpriced, the food was blah and the service was underwhelming. they offer caviar or oysters to begin, it's a pricey trap... don't fall into it! I will not be going back, definitely over rated."}
{"text":"The line-caught bluefin tuna belly was one of the most amazing things I've ever put in my mouth.  I would end my review with that and 5 stars had the staff not blatantly ignored numerous attempts to get our check. They literally walked by 3-4 times as we waved and said excuse me, without even a nod of acknowledgment. The food overall was solid but, this place is pretty snooty (in a stuffy way, not a fun hipster way)"}
{"text":"As tasting menus go dishes and flow were quite balanced but there a couple of courses j woukd have subbed out.  Service was impeccable...no question.  Flavours were amazingly robust, down  to the garnishes.  Silliness of the charred romaine and shitakes...tenderness of the lamb.  Would gave preferred a cold cheese course and the razor clams were ok not great.

I d9nt have a sweet tooth, but I could have the predessert with the mini meringues and the final dessert trio 10 times over.  A great meal overall."}
{"text":"OVERRATED,presentation does not mean good food!

I finally got the chance to try the apparently best restaurant in Canada according to many people and reviews. I got lucky and got a reservation for a 9 pm evening. It was a special menu because it was Montreal a table week.

Carpaccio de cerf de Boileau: The deer meat was fresh obviously, but the combination of flavors of the nuts with the beef was not working that much for me.

Rillettes de bar rayé: This one was a bit better, mustard crispy part mix with the fish, good flavors

We decided we wanted to try all the main course, and the waited was nice enough to get me and my friend half portions of the gnocchi. I enjoyed this dish, the gnocchi were different than the typical, they mixed it with some sort of nut or something. There was a 40$ add-on for this plate though.  

The Iceland cod was perfectly cooked a flaky beautiful fish and tasted pretty good with a side of squash puree and some potatoes.

My friend took the porc tenderloin, I tried a bit and it was a bit dry and the sauce wasn't anything special.

The desserts, once again presentation is nice but wasn't anything out of this world.

Conclusion, the place is absolutlely not the best restaurant in CANADA. Service was descent, but the most important part is the food, and it did not impress me at for 150$ per person, you can find way better!"}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day with my beautiful girlfriend as a getaway for the weekend. I ain't even from Montreal, I'm from NYC bitch. Anyways, what was I saying?

We had the tasting menu made specially for Vday (actually you didn't have a choice that's all you could order) and it was top notch. I don't speak or read French so I couldn't really tell you what I ate but damn it looked and tasted good! Things I'm 90% sure we're involved: sriracha, venison, cow tongue, gnocchi, pork shoulder, scallop, ceviche, and chocolate and stuff. Fois grae too but im not a fan. Tastes like hardened beef fat in a spam can.

I was in a romantically (and champagne) induced haze so I wish I were more helpful with the actual ingredients but the food, service and atmosphere were splendid! Me and my bitch eating toque, u and ur bitch eating Lo-mein."}
{"text":"For some reason, I had pictured a formal and reserved French restaurant, but Toqué was quite the opposite. The décor was contemporary and had an open feel with high ceilings and lots of light filling the dining room. The staff was youthful and friendly. The restaurant's vibe was one of relaxed elegance. And the same can be said about the food. It was sophisticated and modern French cuisine, but with more restraint and a lighter touch.  I had the chef's \"surprise\" 7 course tasting menu...

Amuse Bouche - chilled tomato soup with herb foam

Princess Scallops marinated with rhubarb water, radish, strawberries, wasabi mousse - colorful presentation. The rhubarb water enhanced the sweetness of scallops while also making it refreshing. However, if eaten with more than one piece of strawberry, the taste of the scallop was lost.  

Steamed Razor Clam, coriander, escarole, ginger, spicy soy vinaigrette - the clam was steamed to perfection and had the most amazing texture - soft and chewy without being rubbery. The clam's delicate sweetness was balanced perfectly by the restrained use of spicy and savory Asian flavors. 

Foie Gras, green apple essence, potato confit, asparagus, peas, turnips - WOW, I never knew foie gras could taste like spring! The foie was amazingly light and elegant with just a hint of sweetness (as opposed to the usual additions of strong sweet or salty ingredients with foie gras). I was told that Chef Laprise doesn't season the foie with anything to keep it super plump and luscious. Beautiful dish! 

Ribeye Carpaccio, white asparagus, popcorn powder, shitake mushrooms, miso, wasabi infused oil - the BEST CARPACCIO to have ever graced my lips! I don't even know where to start - there was so much complexity and layers of flavor in this carpaccio. I especially loved the earthy richness of shitake mushrooms with the beef and that hit of flavor from the miso. I also appreciated the cleansing bites of herb provided by the chopped scallions. The portion size was perfect for this robust dish. 

Squab, turnips, heirloom carrot, pearl onion - it was bold move to include the squab's clawed foot in the dish and definitely made for a striking presentation. The leg was awesome with that lovely rich taste of dark meat, while the other parts of the squab were super moist and tender from being sous vide. 

Hercules Cheese, mushrooms, asparagus, fried shallots, wildflower honey - much more fun than your ordinary cheese plate. I was impressed by the paper thin slice of cheese given how large the cheese wedge was. Lovely combination of flavors and textures - velvety cheese, juicy mushrooms, sweet honey, salty and crunchy fried shallots. 

Rhubarb Sorbet, Meringue on Strawberry & Maple Foam - the meringue was light and sweet, but the rhubarb sorbet was too tart for my taste. 

Overall, I was impressed by my dinner at Toqué. It was evident how much care and technique went into each course, and I could taste the freshness of the seasonal ingredients. The food was relatively light yet had so complexity. Each bite brought in different elements of the dish, continually building on the sophisticated flavors...and kept my taste buds intrigued. The ~$100/person price for the meticulously prepared 7 course Chef's Tasting Menu also kept my wallet happy. I have yet to find this caliber of food for that price in the U.S.

**For pics of each course, go the my blog linked under my profile. Enjoy!**"}
{"text":"Consider yourself lucky if you can dine at this restaurant.  I went and had the seven course tasting menu, sans foie and sans non fish.  (I am pescatarian - vegetarian that eats fish/crustaceans).  While it IS very expensive (200 bucks or so with two glasses of wine) it was a very nice experience.  

It started with an amuse bouche which was milk ice cream with this most amazing salt on it.  I tasted the salt in several courses and the chef must have a special salt he imports because it is fantastic!  These little firebombs of flavor!  Each course hit the tastebud in a special way - salt, bitter, sweet, sour.  First course sea urchin!  My first time eating it!  It was a delicate flavor with some nice accoutrements.  Next course prawns cut in half with tornberries, a non-native invasive species to Canada that were bitter but so interesting!  They added a nice punch to the sauce.  Then some very tender lobster that kept the beautiful lobster taste but complemented with a nice delicate sauce.  After that cuttlefish - ok out of all the courses this is one I WOULD not have chosen.  I am a biologist and the cuttlefish cooked had a lot of similarity to the one alive and that kind of bothered me all night.  I have an affinity for octopus (living) so that might have been it.  It had that salt on it though that made it taste fantastic!  Then halibut, cheese course with honey (AWESOME ate the whole thing even though full, and the last course dessert.  Out of all the courses perhaps this was my least favorite.  Perhaps it is because I am a chocoholic?  I don't know but it was a lime sorbet and a sugar pink ice cream with mint.  I also am not a huge mint fan.  It was very well done so I can't ding this course simply because I want chocolate no mint!  The plate was very pretty although a bit less aesthetically pleasing than the others.  There were these crunchy pink things (no idea what) that I did not like.

All in all - if you are going to go, gird up your credit card and go for the seven courses.  The chef will make it to order for you!  (Allergies, etc.)  Trust him and be adventurous!  I think if you are ever going to try a tasting menu, try it here!  It is well worth it. 

Can I just say that it IS expensive (deserved or not you decide.)  The people eating here don't seem to care - mostly locals so use that as a barometer..  I sat at the bar (my choice, let a couple take the table I was dining alone) and all the folks at the bar did the tasting menu.  The couple next to me did foie, tasting menu, and wine pairing.  Easily a 500 dollar meal.  So let that show you how highly it is rated.

What is with the napkin folding thing other reviewers mention?  Really?  I sat at the bar so didn't expect that at all but the bartender was so kind, helpful with the wine selection I made, and very interesting to talk to."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner at Toqué during my trip to Montréal last weekend. I had very high expectations and the service and food both exceeded them! Very glad I decided to celebrate my birthday here.

My boyfriend and I did the tasting menu (him with Foie Gras and me with Fish) and the five wine pairing. While everything was really good, the seared Tuna was the standout of the meal, and top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. I'm so happy that we were here this specific night, the week they got this tuna in, though I'm sure whatever else they have instead when they don't have the fresh tuna is great too. 

My boyfriend and I both live in Manhattan, so we are rarely wow-ed by food, so when I say that we both were in disbelief when we took the first bites of the tuna I'm not saying it lightly. He's lived there forever and is a frequent traveler, and it was worth it coming here just for me to have the satisfaction of picking a restaurant that produced a meal capable of impressing him! 

The wine was also great, as was the service. Not a cheap meal but definitely a must if you're looking to eat some truly phenomenal food while in Montréal."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing experience! This place not only greets you with a Chef's compliments with a mousse that will only be the beginning of a journey. Business dinner, not a loud place, amazing service! 

I had the foie gras as a first course and I can say it was exquisite, but when the main course came, a rack of lamb incredibly well presented was short to the taste! Best ever!

For dessert I had poached pear, on par with the rest. Everything we all had was part of a journey to a succulent gourmet experience."}
{"text":"Came for brunch, which was not a bad deal since all the mains came with a starter. Everything was simple and tasty. The lamb stew was tender. Skip the rabbit, since that was a bit lean and not as flavorful."}
{"text":"I went recently to celebrate getting into my doctorate program, and everything about this place was amazing. The food was obviously amazing, but what really stood out for me was just how accommodating and attentive the staff were. We had a vegetarian, and someone celiac in our group and they were so helpful and flexible about it. The waiter overheard that we were celebrating, and surprised me with a card signed by the chef at the end of the meal! 

Would highly recommend the wine pairing because they really really know what they're doing - it was spot on."}
{"text":"Montreal's place in the world as a culinary hotspot has everything to do with the amazing chefs and restauranteurs that our fair city is lucky to have. And I would argue that no one has done as much to build the Montreal scene as 'The Godfather of Montreal Fine Dining' as per Anthony Bourdain - Normand Laprise. Chef Laprise, previously through Citrus and now Toqué, helped push the use of Quebec produce year round in restaurants and helped developed some of the city's best chefs including Martin Picard.

With all its accolades and prestige, Toqué has been top of my 'to-do' list for a while now but I hadn't found the time to finally visit.... until recently when I got a reservation for MTLàTable this year. So, my fiancé and I got dressed up and made our way down to the Old Montreal to see if my expectations could be met.

Originally on St-Denis street, Toqué relocated in 2004 to The Quartier International of Montreal across the street from the Palais des Congres. The room itself is refined and much bigger than I expected. The room also feels more vacant. The tables are separated apart enough that you never really feel like there is anyone else around you and the restaurant never feels full despite there not being any tables free. The service throughout the night was impeccable - very professional and attentive. The kind of touches you hope to see in a fine dining establishment and that Toqué does very well.

For MTLàTable, Toqué was proposing a 3 course meal with a couple of options at each course. First up, I tried one of the cocktails they were offering for the occasion. The Adam and Eve - Apple Brandy, cider with clove, cardamome and anise syrup - was excellent. A nice balance of apple acidity, sweetness and the spice notes of the cloves and cardamome.

A little amuse-bouche was provided to start - tuna tartare with fennel seed - as well as fresh house baked bread.

For appetizers, we started with the deer carpaccio topped with marinated squash, oyster mushrooms, walnuts and parmigiana reggiano cheese. Beautiful presentation as one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The meat itself was sliced amazingly thin, very tender and flavourful on its own. The addition of the fall veggies, the fresh reggiano and some olive oil really made it pop and provided some nice contrasts of both texture and flavour. A Toqué classic for a reason.

Our other appetizer was stripped bass rilettes served with a bread tuile, dill and kohlrabi. Once again, excellent technique on display. The rillettes, using potato as the binder, were very nicely done with great rich flavour and a nice texture. I really enjoyed how the bass came through so nicely in a dish that I associate more with meat versus fish.

As a main, the duck breast was screaming out to me. Served with roasted squash, black garlic puree, wild rice, pleurotes and herbed jus - the duck was simply exquisite. Perfect cook on it and great flavour. The jus has great depth. I enjoyed the touch of the black garlic as well. And of course, beautiful presentation - one of the best duck dishes I have had.

My fiancé went with the Icelandic Cod served with roasted potatoes, celeriac puree, rabiole, brussel sprouts, romanesco and truffle butter. The cod was beautifully tender and flaky. The lightness of the fish was nicely complimented by the rich puree and the glorious truffle butter. Truffles always make things better!

Dessert kept things going strong. First, a milk chocolate mousse incased in a chocolate ball shell with cacao granola, raspberry jelly and hay caramel. Great depth of chocolate flavour and beautiful presentation again. I liked the jelly being in the center of the ball of mousse.

Our other dessert was caramelized apple jelly served over praline and cinnamon sponge cake, cranberry poached apples, oatmeal and marscapone cream, speculoos crumble and oatmeal ice cream. Lots of elements demanding tons of precision and technique. It was amazing how well the caramelized apple taste came though in the jelly. The poached apples were delicious, the cream was rich and smooth and the ice cream very strong on oatmeal. Tons of fall flavours coming through. Great creative dessert. We also received some little bites at the end - sucre à la creme and some raspberry jellies. Very flavourful and a nice finishing touch to a great meal.

I had very high hopes going in and Toqué successfully met them and then some. Amazing service from beginning to end, wonderful food with high technique and presentation - you understand how Chef Laprise and his crew came to be known as the high-end of Quebec cuisine and how they are able to maintain that level of excellence after all these years. Toqué is a amazing place and we are very lucky to have them here in Montreal.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"We first went to Toque years ago when it was still in the old location. We had the chef's menu (I had the one with Foie Gras and my husband had one without), which we did not know what to expect. Every dish was a pleasant surprise: the food was impeccable and the presentation was extremely impressive! It was by far our best dining experience ever.

When we visited Montreal again, we went back to Toque in its current location. It was much centered location and the dinning room was bigger, but it also became less personal. The food was still good but too much Asian influence this time. Because of my background, it was not nearly as innovative as the first time. Our expectation was so high that we were slightly disappointed. 

It was still a very nice restaurant but with the exchange rate, we found it to be too expensive, especially considered the alternatives (there are tons of great restaurants in town). We will recommend it to someone who has a lot of money and wouldn't mind to spend on a meal. However, for us, it is no longer our number one choice in Montreal."}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu.  Service is pretty impeccable, but the food was just okay.  The only standout dish was the lobster.  It was perfectly cooked in this rich, buttery broth.  The quail was really good too.  However, did not like the shrimp croquet/meatball, the venison, nor the dessert (an almond cake with lemon cream).  The price is really reasonable for a 7 course ($98), but the food didn't knock me off my feet, which is kinda what I was expecting.  Nice location though because it's next to Old Montreal.  Ambiance is nice too."}
{"text":"J'enleve 1 étoile en partant puisque ce resto tres reputé nous a servi le pain froid ... le reste tres gouteux, bon service, place bien aerée, grand local bien arrangé."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!

5 stars for food, service, and ambiance!

The staff in this restaurant were all very friendly and helpful.  They were young and had a very tasteful and trendy uniform.  The decor was contemporary and spacious.  Tables were spaced well apart to give you a very personal feel.  

For the 1st course, we had the dried cured ham with pear.  Great balance of sweet and savory.  Entree, we had the suckling pig sous vide.  It was cooked to perfection, very tender and flavorful.  The components of the dish with shallots, beets, and mushrooms complimented the pork very nicely.  We also had the cavetelli pasta with foie gras shaving, which was very nice too.  They were not cheap with their foie gras shavings.  It was actually quite opposite of what I imagined \"shavings\" to be.  Sommelier also did an awesome job helping us with our choice of red wine.  It came in chunks larger than the size of sugar cubes.  Now, my favorite part, dessert.  We were stuffed by this time, but had to try the Zucchini cake with Squash ice cream, which was fantastic.  Never had anything better! It was light and not too sweet. Really different and delicious.

Overall, if you're looking for a great meal with excellent service. I would highly recommend Toque!! We went on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was full, but we were not rushed at all.  Again, tables were spaced out nicely, so we did not hear other people's conversations.  I would love to try their other desserts.  The selections all sounded very creative, different, and I'm sure delicious.  If they can make me crave for zucchini cake and squash ice cream , I'm sure everything else on the menu would be awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was really fancy and the design of the dishes.. The plating was superb. it was art more than food. I almost felt bad about eating it. But the wait between each dish or to even start the meal was ridiculous. I guess because it was Valentine's Day. But a 5 hour meal. We left the restaurant close to 1am. I mean really? 

It was a 8 course chef tasting menu. The first 4 dishes were great. But I didn't like the veal, cow tongue, or the liver. So 4 dishes out 8 I couldn't eat. 

I found it funny that they had waiters and waitresses walking around to refill your bread rolls.. I almost felt like they were giving bread to fill us up because the dishes were SO SMALL. I guess that's what happens when you go to super high end restaurants? 

The cocktails were amazing tho. They definitely have mixologists. 

The service was great tho. 

Total was $420 without tip."}
{"text":"Went to Toque on a recent trip to Montreal.  Have to say, thumbs up all around in terms of service, food, and ambiance.  This is a large spacious restaurant with an intimate feel, maybe on account of the dim lighting.

Service was excellent.  Our waiter Jonathan was friendly, informative, and just attentive enough without making me feel like he was hovering.

Food was very good.  This place is a bit pricey, and I sometimes leave pricey restaurants feeling like the meal wasn't worth what I paid, but I definitely feel like this place was worthy.  What we got:  Apps - foie (which came with popcorn and some sort of puree) and scallops (with a watercress foam); Entrees - duck and suckling pig; Dessert - thyme meringue with chocolate pieces and a granita.   Of the entire meal I'd probably say I enjoyed the foie and the meringue dessert the most.  Both were a nice combination of textures and flavors.  The foie was so rich and buttery, I kind of wished it came with some toast so I could have spread it like a meat butter.  Scallops were sweet, light and refreshing, but I wasn't a huge fan of the watercress foam.  My suckling pig entree was juicy and tender, but I wish it had a harder sear on the skin side - wasn't crisp enough for me.

The restaurant also gave us a little cheese filled pastry and a chocolate at the beginning and end of the dinner.  They were good, but nothing special.  The pastry just reminded me of a bite-sized cheese wonton."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend making a reservation. We had one for two on Friday night at 9:30PM - we showed up about half hour early and they made room to take us. Excellent service at the front door. Actually a little TOO buttoned up for my taste. Would've liked to see something a little more casual. The decor was eh, honestly not the best but the food was incredible. I shared two appetizers and two entree's with a friend and it was definitely enough food. We had the pork and the duck - both were excellent  the duck in particularly was some of the best I've ever had. My first time trying duck heart - and it was amazing. Surprisingly, loved it. The cocktails were also stand out - very very fresh - one of mine even had little edible purple flowers in it. Overall - great place for fine dining in Montreal!"}
