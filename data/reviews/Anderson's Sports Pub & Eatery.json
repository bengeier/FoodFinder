{"text":"Worst dive bar in Mentor! Trashy people come there and harass other bar goers. A Caucasian guy with teardrop tats was absurdly drunk and saying racist comments right in front of the waitress... of course they didn't care or decide to cut them off the booze and just laughed it off."}
{"text":"My first visit here was not bad but nothing to write home about.  I stopped in for lunch on friday and i was the only one in there so service was great never had an empty glass and i wad able to order as soon as i made my mind up.  The bar tender recommend the irish egg rolls which came out very quick,  there were nicely cooked and crispy. The russian dressing was very good with the egg rolls but unfortunately the eggrolls by them self had a weird taste to them which i believe is from the fryer oil because the house chips that came with my Jameson burger had the same off flavor.  The burger was actually perfectly cooked and well seasoned, just need to work on a few things and this place could be 4 or 5 stars for sure. I actually give them a 3.5 but cant do that woth yelp!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. You can tell that most of it is made from scratch. The burgers are some of the best in the area. Their prices are good and the quantity is generous. It was our first time eating here, but it won't be our last."}
{"text":"Walked in, grabbed a table as the bar was full. Bartender came over and took drink orders. 15 minutes later, our drinks show up, and we never saw another waitress or waiter.  We left, as did at least 3 other tables.  The food looked good but we had no chance of eating. Oh well."}
{"text":"Excellent food: try the Anderson Burger.   Large selection of draft beers and the bartenders are great. They've done a nice job with the place.    People that rate this place low need to look around at the local options.  This ain't Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place.  Good food at reasonable prices.  Good service.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Excellent choice of beers."}
{"text":"Great curb appeal.  The two star rating seems unfair To us.  Stopped in and got fantastic service, one of the best burgers I've ever had ANYWHERE.  try the Anderson.   Prices are great, and food is really really good. We did apps and burgers.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped to get a Reuben sandwich for dinner, service very slow when finally arrived corned beef was large thick slices of meat was cold and had no sauerkraut and cold marble bread. Was out of thousand island dressing and was never told before ordering. Upgraded our chips for extra $1.99 to fries and coleslaw, server said they were making cole slaw and would be out shortly and never came. Obviously this is a drinking bar and not a food bar. Unlike some that have good pub food. Was sorry i didn't get a Reuben next door at Arby's. Won't go back. First time had to try. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"VERY VERY under staffed!!!!  This place has such potential but are failing!  My husband order the Shepard pie and the waitress came out and said they didn't have the meat????  We had our cocktails and waited and waited and waited.  The poor girl and only girl was running her a-- off at the bar and finally came over almost in tears as the cooks didn't have our food made, etc.  We ended up leaving w/o dinner.  I was just saying this would be a great local bar to hang out at.  NOT!!!  Very disappointed!  Went to Lakeshore Eatery down the street and had a good dinner.  What a shame that a newly remodeled place could go to hell that fast.  We really felt sorry for the poor girl working tonight."}
{"text":"Bartenders are great! Very attentive. Will be back to this neighborhood bar. Today is was very busy. Wings were great. Boxtys are awesome....they even have scotch eggs! Good specials and a great selection of beers along with many drink specials. They also have a front patio to relax on."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little dive. Came here on a Thursday night. Thursday features some pitcher of beer specials and they also have 20 cent boneless wing night. The Hot flavored boneless are delicious but the Garlic Parmesan were unfortunately a little dry.  The place has a fun dive atmosphere. It seems that a lot of locals in the area come here to frequent quite often. Everyone was friendly though and welcoming. Not too shabby!  Drinks were a little watered down for my tastes for a dive. The bartenders were nice but like I said when you go to a dive you expect a decent pour.  Nonetheless it's a solid spot for a drink and some simple bar food. Would come back again to try again.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my girlfriend on the way to grocery store ( yes. Cocktail before grocery shopping). Very nice place. Everyone is super friendly. Happy hour homemade popcorn with secret seasoning. Yummy. My girlfriend wanted to try a new drink. The bartender was so fun with creating different drinks. Her favorite was the Nutty Irishman. Those go down easy and can get you in big trouble. Great place to stop for a drink."}
