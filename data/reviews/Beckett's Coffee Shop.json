{"text":"This cafe has a really friendly atmosphere. The food is simple but good and the drinks are great. I love the fact that the cafe is full of second hand books so you can drop in and pick up a book to read there or to buy. The decor is cosy and the outside looks smart. The staff are friendly and welcoming and they have a dogs welcome policy."}
{"text":"We found Becketts by chance on a recent trip to Whitby and what an excellent find. It was the dog friendly signs that attracted us as we were trying to find somewhere to go with our retriever. It is really cosy, the staff are very welcoming and friendly and the cakes are to die for! This is well worth a visit and highly recommended for anyone out with their dog."}
{"text":"This place made my week in Whitby! Ate here twice for lunch.
Great food, all homemade, great value and wonderful staff
Only downside was a silly woman who allowed here dog to sit on her knee and kept feeding it from the table!
Did'nt mind that they allow dogs, have them myself, but they should stay firmly on the floor.
Will be back tho' later in the year."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place. Nice coffee, friendly welcoming atmosphere, absolutely delicious (and huge) home made cakes. Service has always been warm, friendly and with a smile. They are also very welcoming to dogs.
The thing me and my wife particulary like is that the cafe is lined with second hand books, and we rarely go in without coming away with some new reading matter.
 What more could you want? Highly reccommended"}
{"text":"Set just out of the centre of Whitby is Beckett's Coffee Shop, our favourite place in Whitby. On a rain soaked December day we visited twice in one day, once for coffee and then again for lunch. Beckett's has a very relaxed feel, bookcases adorn the walls, containing books you can borrow or buy to wile away the hours, you can even borrow a range of reading spectacles! Becketts is not a big place, it fills up quickly, it clearly has its regulars, its a pity we live so far away, else we would be too. Food dishes are chalked on a board adjacent to the serving counter, that has a myriad of types of tea above it and the most wonderful cakes below it, the lemon cake is unbelievable in both size and taste! The coffee is superb, strong and flavoursome, but I went for something a little more left field to accompany my lunch, a candy floss milkshake! Could have been a disaster, but it wasn't, fantastically refreshing, a bit of a triumph. My wife and I shared a trademark 'Beckanini' for lunch, we went for vegetarian one with pesto, full of flavour. Becketts champions local produce, and the staff are enthusiastic and knowledgeable. All in all, my kind of coffee shop."}
