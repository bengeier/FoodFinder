{"text":"Great bar girls. Breakfast super good and inexpensive. We come here every weekend. Don't forget to try the Fish fry on Fridays. French fries A + get them extra crispy!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite item on the menu so far... Phoenix Philly! So delicious and the fries are so good!! Atmosphere is comfortable. Pool Table, dart board, a couple of games... Nice place to relax. Can't wait for football to start! Lots of TVs to watch all the games! And football  specials!"}
{"text":"I'm a female in this bar for Happy Hour with my husband.  There's 3 guys at the bar who start loudly telling knock knock jokes about gang banging within earshot of everyone in the bar including the female bartender.  She says nothing to them.  I'm offended enough to say \"WHAT ARE YOU 12??\"  This shuts them up.  The bartender should have taken control and told them to knock it off!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great.  It's a great place to have a drink or two.  When you walk in and the bartender knows your name and drink that's the kind of hospitality that makes you wanna keep going back"}
{"text":"It's all about Colleen's T and A! aTtentive service and Assistance.  But seriously this is a place that feels more like going and watching the game at your buddies house. You have a quick cold beverage, usually before you even get to your seat, and some hand shakes and back slapping fun to be had by all. I've just recently moved here and feel very at home when I walk into the Rec Room. Big thanks to Colleen and crew."}
{"text":"New bar in area. Food was horrible. Table was dirty. Bartender can't make drinks. Won't be running back unless I hear it's Better. Too bad it's in my neighborhood and I'll have to skip past it"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, and good prices. Bar food on the menu, with kid options! I hope this place can stick around- it's nice to have a little sports bar in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this bar!!!!! The new owner modernized this place, finally I can watch a sports game on good size TV. Also, it's one of the only bars in the area that actually stays open to 2am, and they do have a nice smoking/drinking patio."}
{"text":"A terrible place to go unless you are looking to get cocaine. A really bad crowd and everyone here either does drugs or sells them."}
{"text":"We've gone a few times now and I say it's good.  Friday fish fry is delicious and drinks are cheap.  Music level is not too loud to blast your nerves and noise in general is just right.  Service is nice and drink selection is decent.  Feels comfortable inside to relax after work. It has potential for a good neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I give this plays five stars, based on what it is: A great local neighborhood hang out.  Good food, good prices, and a great staff. There aren't many places left where you can get $2 domestic bottles anytime, or a complete breakfast for $2.99. The owner is a nice, hard-working guy, who puts a lot of time and energy into the place. It's clean, well equipped with TVs, darts, pool table, and a jukebox."}
{"text":"There are tons and tons of sports bars in the northwest valley, so it's important that each one does something to stand out. Came here Saturday night excited to try something new. I feel that several years ago, this area would be bustling with twentysomethings from ASU West, but it's died down quite a bit. 

Where'd everyone go?

It was 11pm, but there was no music, and almost no one but a group of hicks who treated the bartender as if they'd never interacted with a woman before in their lives. Was annoying to hear nothing but sexist banter, so I tuned them out while she served up items from the modest draft selection, ranging from about $2-$4 .50(plus tax). The patio is very minimal, and not exactly ideal for fostering a social environment because it's so small. But at least my friends won't have to awkwardly stand in front of the building to light up a stogie. 

This seems to be everyone's day drinking spot. There are a LOT of TVs, all conveniently placed. During the day, they've got quite a menu as well, but I won't hold my breath when a very rough looking gentleman described it as being \"ok food if you're drunk, maybe\". I'm also reading something about a kids' menu, and I'm not excited about the idea of little runts hanging around while I try to catch the game. It'll get a second chance when I meet up with a bunch of friends, but I don't really think this is a place I could have fun. At least drinks are cheap, and the bartender I had was very gosh darn cool."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the layout is nice.  I'd give 5 stars if there were dedicated bartenders and servers, instead of a waitress running back and forth doing both jobs and excelling at neither."}
{"text":"Really fun music bingo and name that tune on Fridays. Fun electronic games available,  including trivia. Good drinks,  I've only eaten the fries there but they're good. Fun crowd!  Definitely a great Friday night hangout!"}
{"text":"This place is closed. Rode by it on April 23, 2016 and two real estate signs are in the windows.

Feel bad this happened. The problems with the operations were obvious and I wish the owner had responded to my offer to help. I even offered to help with out charging a fee because the neighborhood needs a nice, friendly, local place for food, drinks, and fun."}
{"text":"Great place to meet on Sunday morning for breakfast with good friends. The food is excellent and very affordable."}
