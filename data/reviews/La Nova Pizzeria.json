{"text":"Had a hoagie delivered from the New Kensington spot. Very good. It was 16-18 inches long. Ten bucks. A good price for a meal for two days. Steak, cheese, lettuce, mushrooms, and tomatoes come standard. A worthy hoagie. Fucking worthy."}
{"text":"Open late on a Sunday night. We stopped in off the highway on our way to Philadelphia, and after asking a local police where to get a hoagie we ended up at La Nova. My girlfriend got a small calzone and I ordered the full size Chicken Parm sandwich. Not super cheap, at $23, but the chicken parm was HUGE and so was the \"small\" calzone. I saved half of the sandwich for my next meal, and I am not a dainty eater. Both the sandwich and the calzone were very good; great sauce and tasty dough. I would definitely return to try other options, if I didn't live so far away. The pizzas coming out of the oven looked great."}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating- THEY DELIVER TO NEW KENSINGTON!!!!!   Okay, now that you get that...  The pizza was exactly what I wanted! It was close to a New York style pie, light on sauce and cheese.  I was just thrilled. The sauce was perfectly spiced and the cheese wasn't greasy. We had pepperoni and there was no grease to blot! This makes me a happy girl.   My only, slight, disappointment was that the pie wasn't piping hot. Now it could have something to do with the cold weather, so I'm not going to complain too loud. It wasn't going to stop me from eating the pie!  I'll continue to order from here.  I was ordering from Papa John's but this pie was cheaper, bigger, and WAY tastier than Papa John's will ever be."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Just moved to the area trying new places and we will be getting takeout again for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I just had their gyro delivered for lunch.  The meat was cooked on a rotisserie, each slice nicely browned.  Red onions, nice tomatoes, and a lovely toasted, chewy pita.  I love that it was delivered with the tzatziki in it's own little container in the bag.  (With that, the tzatziki was a little plain for my tastes)   The whole thing was delivered in foil, not greasy but reasonably juicy.  (Jeez Louise, guys!  It's a gyro.  Whaddya want?) I will definitely be ordering delivery from this place again!  Oh, and very reasonable prices!  $6 for the gyro."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food! The pizzas are great, the though is flaky and soft,but well cooked. Everything was fresh - the salads were great. Awesome place!  P.S. Big portions so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are good, never had anything else. The bad no parking it is on a Main Street and very tight with cars on both sides you very easy to take mirror off other than that good experience I eat here at least 2 times a month"}
{"text":"My boss orders from here when she has employee lunches! I've had the pasta, pizza, and now I've had the gyro. My boyfriend and I ordered the gyro platter special- 2 gyro platters with 2 cans of soda for $17. It's SO GOOD. The meat is so tender, and the cucumber sauce that they include on the side is delicious- and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually care for it. I ended up using it to rip my fries in."}
{"text":"Ate here recently for lunch. Great, friendly, fast service.  2 Large TVs.  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. One of the best around. Sauce is sweet and smooth. Toppings taste fresh and you get plenty.  I could not stop eating the pizza and I did not waste one slice.  I recommend this place to anyone in the area for dine-in or take out!"}
{"text":"I have to say the menu allows for fries and coleslaw with a fish hoagie. They were out of coleslaw and when the order was delivered no fries. Call back to inquire and informed fries are not included and it would be an extra cost now. Not to mention the order was read back to us so there is no room for error on our part. I have seen children with lemonade stands conduct better business. Will never order from here again. Disappointed more than one could imagine."}
{"text":"This place is a- mazeballs!!!  Okay being the foodie that I truly am...I ordered...ready 1 gyro combo with fries. 1 small 10 inch pepperoni pizza 1 ordered of seasoned wings 1 half hoagie (if you don't know Google it) I got the Italian but without ham, I subbed pepperoni. Fries and drinks were included. Baby when I say omg....I had lfe decisions..not to mention I was there yeasterday with my daughter and my girl... Lordt I was ready to move back home... The food was just how it should be and looks...all real with no corners cut...I loved it so much I was ready to come back again  today but I was running late to pick up grandma...lol She will be bitchin' if I'm late in her car lol... But omg this place was warm, clean, and the service felt like family... CHAD was awesome and so Pittsburghese...just like me.  Yeah tacos in California are great but real Italian food that gives you something to dream about in Pennsylvania cannot be beat...smh..I died and came back. Not to mention I ate everybody's leftovers... gorgeous Chad and that beautiful hairless guy were awesome, fast, and just the type of people you want to. No you need to get food from."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!  There dough is amazing and baked perfectly.  Sauce is tangy and sweet just perfect.  Toppings were fresh and all around one of the better pies ive had."}
{"text":"This place was found and the decision to go here was purely Yelp-driven.  We were on our way back to Pittsburgh from New Ken and were super hungry.  Apparently very few people outside of the city are on yelp, but this one had 5 good reviews, which was better than any other nearby place. Pizza and wings it is!    And I was not disappointed.  We got the large cheese pizza and wings special, and were so hungry the hubby and I ate 3/4ths of a pizza and 8 wings.  Yikes!  For me, a good pizza crust is hard to find.  I can't explain it but I have an innate aversion to crispy bread.  Toast, bagels, English muffins - i always air on the side of under-toasted rather than too brown.  ...I dunno where it came from, but it makes me picky when it comes to pizza.  This crust was the perfect softness for dipping in ranch dressing.  Two thumbs up from this girl.  Wings were pretty good - very hot, but better than I expected from a random pizza shop.  Overall, great meal.  I don't know that I'd go out of my way to go back, as this was the first time I was ever in Springdale, but it was a good find on the way through."}
{"text":"La Nova is a small storefront restaurant that seems to do a lot of take-out and delivery business.  However, there are a few tables with total seating for maybe two dozen people.  If eating there, you order and pay at the counter, and the staff brings it to your table.  We had the pizza and found it pretty good.  Crust was medium thickness, perhaps leaning to the thinner side.  Sauce was flavorful, and the sausage and pepperoni were both tasty as well.  For drinks they have a selection of canned and bottled sodas.  There is no parking lot, so you have to park on the busy street out front.  You might wish to retract your side windows so that one of the trucks driving by does not take it off.  All in all, a decent place for a meal.  Next time I will need to check out the other menu items, which all sound very good as well."}
{"text":"We order lunch from here quite often. My team tells me the gyro combo is amazing.  There are 3 people that order it every time.  Love the chefs salad.  The wings are great too - plain and spicy.  Pizza is amazing"}
{"text":"A nice find.  Thanks to fellow yelpers for pointing it out.    First off, I have no idea about the pizza.  The table next to me had one and it looked pretty good.  Maybe next time.  Me, I had the small Mediterranean hoagie and it was all that I had hoped.  And the small one was a lot bigger than I had hoped.  The mix of olives, roasted peppers, red onion, feta and provolone was nearly ideal in proportions.  What completely won me over were the artichoke hearts.  This place doesn't skimp on the artichokes.  They were a perfect complement.  Even the melted cheese was lightly browned.   The bread was toasted exactly right and had a nice slight crunch to counter the gooey inside.     The french fries were hot, but otherwise not all that spectacular.  The salad I ordered to-go, held up well for a few hours and much like the small hoagie, was way bigger than one person could eat.  The service was abrupt, but not rude, and that's okay.  Some places have everything pre-made and then warm it up before serving it, claiming it's homemade.  Not so here.  Either that, or they do a good job of disguising it.    Overall, La Nova is a solid choice.  Thanks Yelp."}
{"text":"Homemade dough and savory sauce.  Good start. The Mediterranean pizza did its part. Wonderful flavors and tasty dough! What a meal to go.  The Mediterranean pizza is scrumptious and savory...garlic sauce, red onions, artichoke hearts, black olives, roasted peppers, tomatoes & feta.  What else could you ask for."}
{"text":"Open late and great food. Small little spot just a few minutes off the highway. Delicious calzone that could have weighed 2lbs. Sauce tasted homemade, not something out of a can, and the dough was fantastic.   Not fast service, so not ideal if you are in a rush, but a great 20 minute stop on a cross-country drive. Will stop again if we find ourselves on I-76 needing a good meal."}
