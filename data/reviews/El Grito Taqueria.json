{"text":"I travel a lot for work and I always like to try new food.  El Grito nails it.  They create perfect flavorful tacos.  A must when in Madison.  Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Top quality taco experience in every respect. I ate one of each taco on the menu and I found the pork, carrot, and steak tacos all excellent. The steak taco was my favorite. The location of this mobile taqueria is ideal: it is close to the Capitol and surrounding museums and attractions and also close to shades benches for seating."}
{"text":"Fabulous tacos but get there early.....they're so good they often sell out.  This is not your ordinary truck food; it's more like a mobile restaurant:  the highest quality ingredients, perfectly seasoned, served with enthusiasm and pride in the product.  When I arrived at Allen Centennial Garden where El Grito was serving that evening, several of the choices were no longer available -- consumed by happy diners.  I had the beef brisket - a generous portion of juicy, delicious beef in a taco shell, best taco I've had in a long time.  These guys know what they're doing.     Follow them on Facebook to see where they'll be day by day.  Then head out there!  I live in California but will definitely return to El Grito on my next visit."}
{"text":"I had these amazing tacos at a few locations around town, but they are currently holding down the fort at 11 N Allen St for a couple months. I tried to keep their tacos at an \"occasional treat\" frequency, but now that they are so close to work... it's all over. El Grito is inventive and fresh, while paying homage to the tacos they know and love from the Southwest. It's the best of both worlds, and they absolutely nail it."}
{"text":"El Grito tacos are THE BOMB! I'm a Mexican guy from L.A and I know tacos. These guys put so much effort and love into the quality of their food - from the preparation of the meats, to the roasted vegetables, to the dressings and sauces. You can get more expensive food in Madison, but it probably won't be as good as these fine little tacos. Do yourself a favor and go get some ASAP!"}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in Dane County. It's a shame that they have such a short season with limited hours, but I will feast on these tacos whenever I have the opportunity.   The standard pork, brisket, and chicken are all excellent.  However the highlight for me tends to be the vegetable tacos, which I have passed on my entire life until sampling El Gritos.  The cauliflower, carrot, and sweet potato are all super delicious.  Watch out for the mango salsa as it has a heck of a kick."}
{"text":"Disclaimer... I have known Matthew, the magic behind the food since he was two. That said, folks that know me, know I am honest to a fault and very picky about my food. Not only do I know Matthew, but I also know Josh, the brains behind the marketing and graphics side of the business. Both men deserve accolades for their commitment to great food and marketing.  I was fortunate to be at The Robin Room on East Johnson when El Grito was doing their thing.  They presented three equally delicious tacos all of which were expertly prepared, easy to eat, and tasted wonderful from the first bite til the last.  The tacos were like lovely pillows, nothing fancy, just vehicles for the deliciousness that lay within. The first taco was chicken, spiced with adobo and an orange salsa. Spicy, juicy goodness.  The next taco nodded to the vegetarians, with sweet potato and roasted carrots. A little crunch from the pine nuts, as the chili sauce brought awareness to your tastebuds. All in all, down right delicious.  Last but not least was the slow roasted pork shoulder. Moist juicy shredded morsels, paired with mango salsa, pickled red onion and fresh cilantro. The cilantro screamed freshness while the pickled onions taunted the roast pork saying \"stand up\" and be counted. The roast pork rose to the occasion.  I have to admit to drinking two Sazerac's with my dinner. My favorite cocktail allowed the tacos to shine. Truthfully, it was a lovely meal all around.  I am following El Grito on Facebook. I suggest you do the same. Can't wait until my next El Grito culinary adventure.     Follow El Grito wherever it goes. You will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"The most savory, unique and authentic tacos in town! I'm always impressed by the flavors and freshness. Warm, soft corn tortillas. Juicy, mouth-watering brisket and pork. And clever vegetarian options too! Love you El Grito!!!"}
{"text":"These dudes have it going on! Your taco search ends here. Get off Yelp and go get some."}
{"text":"I got their amazing sweet potato soft tacos from the food truck. I knew that with every bite I was closer to being done, but they tasted so good that I couldn't stop eating them. My only gripe is that the soft tacos were so small, but it wasn't enough of a problem for me to knock off a star."}
{"text":"Seriously good food, and one of my favorite carts in Madison!!  They usually feature three types of tacos on their menu: two different meats and one vegetable taco. I love their meat (brisket, pork and chicken) tacos but be sure to NOT EXCLUDE that vegetable (sweet potato, roasted carrot, and cauliflower) taco! Sounds strange, but they've got me hooked on that veggie taco. I always order one of each, no matter what's featured that day. They use fresh, farm ingredients, with bold and spicy flavors.   Their habanero sauce is homemade and definitely brings the heat. If they ever decide to bottle that sauce, I'd be the first to pre-order a case of datt!!!!  Sometimes they have house-made drinks, like horchata or watermelon agua. Both will quench your thirst and satisfy your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Exemplary tacos.  They are tiny but tasty. (That's ok, I can always head to Naty's for a large-and-in-charge al pastor!) In a world plagued by uninspired veggie tacos, even the veggie taco was terrific. The truck and trailer are also a sight to behold.   When does the brick and mortar place open up? I'm there."}
{"text":"Thanks to El Grito's social media presence, I was able to sample their tacos at their pop-up event in front of Underground Butcher. They feature an ever-changing rotation of taco varieties, and are masters at flavor combinations.  Food-wise, I have zero complaints - I cannot wait to enjoy their tacos again! My only request would be to have non-soda beverage options, like water, sparkling water, or tea. Depending on their pop-up location, you may be able to snag an alternate drink nearby.  Keep up the great work, El Grito!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! So much flavor and so unique. highly recommend. The cauliflower taco with pumpkin seeds on top was unlike anything I have ever tried before. Someone else said that these guys are masters of flavor combination and that's so true!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place was incredible! The service was quick and friendly and the food could not have been better! By far the best food truck I've ever been to! I got the steak tacos - they were amazing."}
{"text":"I gave the truck another try and I was impressed. The tacos are delicious, and didn't have another issue with cleanliness. The presentation of the tacos is beautiful. Everything was so good we went two days in a row."}
{"text":"We used El Grito catering for the rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding. We did the \"drop off\" option and everything went so smoothly. The employees who dropped it off were helpful (and arrived exactly at the pre-arranged time), the ingredients were so well-organized/packaged and labelled so we could set it up easily, and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I've raved over a pricey Mexican restaurant in Dallas and the food in this little taco stand equals or surpasses it. It's not your run of the mill Tex-Mex or even authentic Mexican - it's  gourmet take on tacos. We were lucky - it was about 1:30 when we went to the window, and I believe we got the last of their food. We had the 3 for $10 tacos and got a  cauliflower, a chicken, and a pork taco. The complexity of the flavors in the cauliflower taco were amazing - my mouth is watering just thinking about it. And the pork and chicken tacos were as good. I've got to come up with a reason to drive back into Madison just to get more of this fantastic food. I'll post pics of the three tacos and the menu."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten something and then wished you had another stomach so you could eat more? That's how I felt immediately after consuming three tacos from El Grito.   Best tacos in Madison!  This place is worth the hype. My friend described it as a hipster taco. I don't know if that's how I'd describe it. All I know is it only cost $3 for the best taco party in my mouth I've ever had. Damn, it is good!"}
{"text":"I tried their tacos for the first time at Make Music Madison in central park from the food truck, and now I believe the hype. The brisket was a standout favorite, with some kind of green sauce that was unlike anything I've had on a taco before. Fresh, fresh, fresh flavors. Not a lot of heat, but their house made chili sauce adds even more fresh, piquant flavor. A lot of complexity going on here, flavorwise. The two guys manning the truck were friendly, fun and clearly dedicated to creating a great looking and tasting product, worrying over the wind that was threatening to dislodge the sprig of cilantro on top of each taco. The pork was good, too, but the brisket blew me away. Have you tried the brisket? Try the brisket."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos!! My whole family loves to visit \"the taco truck\" and will search it out around Madison.  I have tried several of their veggie tacos and have been very satisfied- even the cauliflower taco I was questioning.  Everything is gluten free!"}
{"text":"Creative, unique, and amazingly delicious. Their selection is ever changing to reflect seasonally available ingredients in southern Wisconsin. These tacos use the best Wisconsin has to offer to bring flavors of the world to Madison.  The post their upcoming pop ups on Facebook, so be sure to follow to get the updates!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos that are worth the wait!  Each taco is tiny but full of flavor. Be sure to buy a set of three--you get a small discount, and since the tacos are small, it's the right portion. Each taco has 2 flour tortillas (fresh off the griddle) and you can select which tacos you want. It's not \"make your own taco\", but that's not a bad thing as the flavor combinations are great. Each order does take a while as they are prepared to order.  Favorites: spicy sweet potato (the only spicy one out of the bunch) and savory pork.  In addition, the horchata is awesome.  It is super rich and creamy (btw, it is not vegan--it has rice milk and dairy) so it's somewhat akin to a liquidy rice pudding.  A bottle of sauce is available for your tacos as well, but it's not a hot sauce as it has more of a vinegar base.  The line was long shortly after opening, so if you're planning to get these tacos--be the first in line to try them!"}
{"text":"YUM! Quick, easy, reasonable, and tasty. There are only three tacos to choose from, 2 of them are meat and 1 is vegetarian. Since I don't eat meat I had to opt for two of the cauliflower kind. Now, don't get me wrong, it was delicious. However it would've been nice to have more selection. My friend that came with got one honey pork and one brisket and wasn't sure about the honey pork. To quote her, \"there's too much going on here.\" Regardless, it was a super convenient lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I confess that it's been a while since I had one of their tacos.  I checked them out when they were last in Stoughton.  And I'm not sorry one little bit that I did.  I agree with Jeff L.  Just go.  Words can't describe the tasty things you will find."}
{"text":"Wow these tacos are good. I found these and their little slice of heaven on wheels when I was down at the capitol in Madison and it was a fabulous grab-and-go lunch. I picked a combo of all three tacos they had when I was there: the Roasted Sweet Potato, Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder, and Smoked Bricket. All three were a mix of flavors I did not have any precedent for and were amazing treats. If all of their recipes are a fantastic as the three I tried, I will be going back there many, many times."}
