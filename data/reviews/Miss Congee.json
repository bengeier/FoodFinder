{"text":"I don't know what the food tastes like here because after being seated in a seat in front of the door (which was freezing as it is winter), and waiting half an hour for our food, we chased the same waitress about our order twice (she didn't get back to us at the first time). After the second time, we were asked to reorder because apparently our order was never entered. When we confronted the waiter who took our order, he denied ever even taking it. If you like being served by waiting staff that excel in staring at you blankly, this place is perfect for you.

We left before reordering in both anger and dire hunger.  The service here is quite poor, I am never going again and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Had absolutely no expectations when walking into this place due to the horrible reviews on Yelp but surprisingly it wasn't that bad and with improvement over time they can be a good competitor for congee queen. 

To start off on a good note, the food quality and portions were decent. I had a noodle, congee, duck and fried pork - everything tasted amazing and on point. 

However I do agree with most people where the service quality definitely needs improvement and they better do something about it fast because it's obviously costing them their reputation. They surprisingly hired very very inexperienced waitresses and seem unorganized to a point where they may have opened prematurely. 

Overall it exceeded my little expectations that I had and I'll be back hoping for service improvements !"}
{"text":"Food 2/5
Lacking the 'restaurant' taste and aroma
Congee was gooey.
Go for Congee queen just a short drive east.

Service 3/5 
Not a very busy Sunday night. Typical Chinese restaurant service.

Ambience 2.5/5
Minimalistic decor. 
The golden brown design looks suspiciously similar to other Chinese restaurants

Summary
Give it another year or two
If it's still around, I'd check the latest reviews first theb give it another try"}
{"text":"Terrible organization and service. Been waiting for almost an hour and the food still hasn't arrived. 

Staff is lost. Asked multiple times on the status of our orders. No one could give us an answer. 

Just witnessed a waitress get into a loud and animated argument with a customer. In front of a fully packed restaurant. 

Should have read earlier reviews before choosing this place. We're experiencing the exact same terrible service.

Save yourself the headache and go to Congee Queen. There's a reason why they do so well."}
{"text":"Good place to come for decent family style Chinese food, good portions, good variety.  They offer combo menus, so you can order a number of dishes from a list for a fixed price.   

Spacious venue, very comfortable if coming with large groups or with kids.

(We had Peking duck, Shanghainese stir fried noodles, snow peas with king mushroom,beef tenderloin on sizzling plate, fried assorted seafood, tofu hot pot).  

Unfortunately, too hungry and didn't take pictures!

Maybe not the best Cantonese cuisine we have had, but really decent and prices are fair.

 Definitely will come again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Worst service. Staff do not speak English. They microwave their BBQ. Would not recommend with so many better Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This morning three families sat together and had a very early brunch to celebrate some birthdays.  When finished and my wife was handling the bill, checking and figuring out the amount the waitress did something I've never seen before in my life.  The waitress moved in as my wife was counting the cash, stood close and told my wife how much more money she should put in for a tip...Very stupid restaurant that won't last if the staff is acting this way."}
{"text":"We went there since Congee Queen is so packed as usual.  Of course we order congee and   beef on rice noodle. Here comes the funny part.  They told us no more congee tonight. I am like ' what '.  Fine. We order Fook Kin Fried Rice.  After 15 minutes,  the waitress brings in the rice noodle and the fried rice.  Wait.  You give me a fork to serve rice?! Not a spoon?! Fine. The rice noodle is not even cook well, the noodle is almost left untouched.  I think these explain why the restaurant is not packed."}
{"text":"Came here with my family a few weeks ago.  It was packed on a Sunday night.  We waited for about 40 minutes for a table but we were forewarned.  We ordered the set Crab/Lobster menu and didn't get the pre-meal soup until after some of the dishes had already arrived.  And that's only after we had asked for it multiple times.  We also didn't get the drinks or rice until much later.  Price was reasonable and food tasted great but not sure if I'd come back again because of the poor service."}
{"text":"Came around Friday around lunch time. Despite the food being decent,  we had a terrible time with the service. For starters, our food has been missed several times, and it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Another thing is I found the sevice to be rude, we had never asked for the bill, but it was brought upon our table. By then it seemed they want to rush out even though the restaurant was not full. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I was already hesitating to come here due to bad reviews, but decided to give them a try anyway. I regret it. DO NOT COME HERE! Many reasons, but I will try to shorten the list for you. 

They charged us extra for one of the items on the menu. Not a huge difference, as it was only $1.50 extra, but they started off their argument with \"the items on our menu are already very cheap, it's only $1.50!\". NOT PLEASED. It's not the amount, but the principle. At this point, we already paid via credit card. It was our fault for not checking the bill clearly before proceeding to pay. But honestly, $1.50 is easy to miss (at least for me?), since I don't remember the price of everything after I order. Anyway, when I asked how can I get the $1.50 back, his response was simply: \"the transaction already went through\". Errrrr, again, not pleased. I asked for the refund in cash. And he gave it (more like threw it, roughly) back to me onto the table.

They went on, while giving us a lot of attitude, and said we ordered the wrong item on the menu... Though I clearly pointed to the item on the menu when ordering. If it was a miscommunication, then fine, but they accused us of not ordering clearly, and told us to check before ordering next time (not that we would be coming back again...). I asked them to show me on the menu which item we were charged for. The guy just walked away. (Uhmm, excuse me?!) So I flagged him down again and asked him to show me. He reached behind me to grab a menu and threw it at the table and told me to check myself. 

I can keep going with this but it's not worth your time nor mine. Bottom line is, DO NOT COME HERE. If you do, double check your bill and don't expect good service. 

Oh, I must add, I spotted two workers walking out of the bathroom without washing their hands."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Food is \"okay-ish.\" Definitely not the best restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner this past weekend at around 6:30pm. There was a line-up to get in but were eventually seated pretty quickly. The restaurant is quite large and the decor and ambience is a nice change from your typical Chinese comfort food establishment (I.e. It is modern and clean).

We ordered the deep fried chicken, 2 types of bbq pork (char siu and siu yuek), sweet and sour beef, some kind of lemony chicken, and a noodle dish. Overall the food came hot and quick and was quite good. I have attached some photos. 

I found the service was okay by Chinese restaurant standards. It was a busy Sat night. 

I will definitely come back to try the congee and Peking duck."}
{"text":"Ordered all the wrong stuff. The congee was bland and watery. I see other customer ordering fried noodle dishes and they look good. If I ever returned, not getting congee."}
{"text":"New congee restaurant in Markham. Horrible customer service. Definitely understaffed - staff is slow cleaning tables and bringing out food, resulting in long wait times. We ordered food for lunch (around 12:30pm on a Saturday) and waited for over an hour with nothing being brought out to our table, and we asked our server several times where our food was. Turns out the waitress put the wrong table number down so there was some confusion. After another 15 minutes with the updated table number, we still didn't get our food - because the waitress didn't put our order down at all. No one offers any reconciliation for the long delay. After waiting 15 minutes for a table and over 75 minutes for food, we left without eating. Definitely do not recommend, unless you have 2 hours to spare for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Affordable, great food and good service. Try the Salt Pepper Pork Chop, it's amazing. Will come here again. :)"}
{"text":"Came on a weekend afternoon but there were no lineups. Waiters were rude and ignored multiple tables who tried to order food. They were busy cleaning tables despite no one waiting for those tables."}
{"text":"I dont usually give low ratings but sorry this place has bad service. Until they work on training their staff and we with their kitchen, I'm not coming back and not recommending this place.

They opened Oct 11, 2015 at dinner time.

Menu and set up is like Congee Queen just at McCowan and hwy 7 except they also serve some seafood like lobster, crab and lobster. 

They do serve alcohol and first page advertises their lobster congee deal. They're lobster is currently priced at $18.99/ lb.

Their fresh tank contains of half dead and floating fishes. ... #micdrop

They're newly opened on hwy 7 between kennedy and mccowan where the old shoppers drug mart was (beside dollarrama). If you're coming from the east side there's no light so be careful coming in cutting through on coming traffic .

1  food isn't that great (better choices within 10 km radius)
2 service wasn't good (no smiles, no introduction of the dish, still learning table numbers or punching in wrong numbers and argue with me what I ordered)
3 kitchen is very slow at delivering food
4 they ran out of congee ... they're a congee restaurant ... at lunch ..... 
5 it took me 1 hr and 15 mins to get 2 dishes and leave (story below)

My experience/ story:

So .. i came in on Saturday 1PM for late lunch. i asked for a table of 2. She gave me a piece of paper that says 2 on it. I looked at her waiting list ... i should be number 10 for 2 people. After a few min she looked at me .. looked at her list and yanked the paper from my hands and said \"I wrote it wrong you are number 10\". Then a head hostess/ manager in black came and told that lady (in blue) to go away in front of people as she is messing things up. That's very rude and not professional.

I was sat at table 51, a half booth in front of the washrooms. At 1:11pm i ordered 3 things. 1. Pork bone congee small. 2. Beef rice rolls. 3. Bbq pork lo mein. 15 mins later ... a big bowl of \"teng jai\" congee came. I said it's not ours, ours is small pork bone. Server said no its yours. It's your congee i said no. Then a manager came and looked at her paper and said it's for the previous guest at this table. And then they started discussing that previous orders for my table are still running and was arguing over that. 

10 mins or so later my bbq pork noodles finally came. Noodle texture was good but lo mein had no sauce to \"lo\" (mix). We finished eating after 15 mins ... sat there waiting .... still no food.

 Then we overheard a server tell the table next to us they're out of congee. They were like \"what? This is a congee restaurant and you're out of congee at lunch!?\" So we waved down our server and asked where our congee and rice roll was, it's been half an hour. she said we got out big \"teng jai\" congee already. I said no I said that wasn't ours we sent it back. Then she said oh then sorry were out of congee. That's very unfair to us because we put in the order before you ran out, we didn't get our congee now because you failed to keep track of your orders and failed to keep track notifying youe guests that you're out of the dish you're mainly selling. 

So we asked to swap it for a beef hor fun (noodles) and cancel our beef rice roll. 15 mins later beef rice roll came. We said we cancelled it already. 15 mins later we get our beef noodles. It sucked. It was very bland and the beef didn't taste very fresh. Then a manager came to ask if we got our beef rice roll yet. We said we cancelled it twice already. 

We asked for the bill and as we were walking out i heard do many tables either complaining about the service or telling the servers they need to improve.

So it basically took me 1 hr and 15 mins at a quick restaurant to get most of my orders wrong or unavailable. On top of that I had to explain multiple times that theyre wrong with their orders and I still haven't gotten mine yet."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant as it was right by my house I ordered the seafood congee a dough fritter and a dough fritter wrapped in rice noodle. Compared to all of the other similar restaurants congee queen congee wong keungs this has got to be the worst I've ever had. The congee had no real pieces of seafood it was all blended mush. It was extra bland compared to all the other restaurants I've ever I had 2 actually add salt to it. The dough fritter tasted as bad the soy sauce they used wasn't even the proper soy sauce it was extremely salty. If I were any of u looking to try it I'd stay away"}
{"text":"Definitely won't be returning as one of our orders came with sour-rotting bbq pork. When we told the employees about the issue, they wouldn't admit their mistake- though they eventually took it off our bill when the table next to us complained about sour rice noodles."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today. After we were seated, a congee arrived at our table when we hadn't place our order yet....
During the meal, everything arrived except for the congee so we asked the waitress and she said all congee is sold out. We were so angry at that moment because if congee is sold out, you should have told us when we placed our order! Isn't it funny a restaurant called Miss Congee sold out of congee before 2pm on a Saturday? I understand this is a new place but I still find it is unacceptable. 
The food was average but the service was horrible. I will not come back again. There are many better congee restaurants."}
{"text":"We went to Miss Congee this afternoon.
Order a BBQ duck noodle and Tomato and eggs on rice sans beef.  The noodle come with just few pieces of ducks back bone with skins only, no meat.  Asked the waitress about it, she said that's the way it come.  I said I don't want it, then she come back and suggest I pay an extra $ for a duck leg.  What a crap.  Then we waiting for the rice for nearly half hour.  It comes with beef anyway.  Very disappointed at this place.  Will not going back."}
{"text":"One star for the service. Another star for the food.
Came here a couple days ago, for NYD. 
Before you start thinking I'm being too harsh, considering it's NYD and they'd be swarmed, it wasn't. An entire section of the store was empty. There was no line up at the door. At 7pm on NYD. (Felt kinda bad but oh well! Fairly new restaurant - must be hard to make a name for yourself right?)

Let me start off by saying the food was fine. Mediocre. Could be a little more creative? But hey, it's not really a big thing. Basically a chinese restaurant you'd go to without making a reservation during rush time on NYD. (ha) 

So, here's the kicker - we get sat down, we order, it's going well. We get the 2 dish peking duk, with 3 side dishes, and a hot honey lemon & cold HK milk tea. Immediately after we ordered, we got a cheque. Yeah, I know, weird. We check it, it's for the table behind us. No big deal, we laugh it off and pass it over. Then, we wait. 
My mom goes to pour us some tea. She can't pick up my dad's cup - too slippery - it's covered in oil! We get a new one, and we wait.
We get our drinks! A cold honey lemon & a hot ovaltine - wait, that's not what we ordered? We call them over, get our actual drinks, and then, you guessed it - we wait. 
30 minutes in, our snow pea sprouts come out! We devour them in about two seconds flat. Aaaaaaand back to waiting!
Thankfully, our peking duk comes out soon after, followed by our diced beef and our steamed tilapia. 
Life's good. We ask for the bill, and - yep, we wait. They forgot. So we ask again, pay and leave. 

I'm gonna keep go ahead and assume what I HOPE y'all are thinking - probably just a bad night. Hopefully."}
{"text":"Took forever to get a hold of a waitress and then the food took even longer. At the end all of the wait was not worth it at all. Would rather go to congee queen which is really close by."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and the service still hasn't changed. It's still mediocre at best and not what I come to expect from a restaurant that's supposed to be a Congee Queen doppelganger. I ordered another baked rice with white sauce this time. Sauce was not overpowering in taste, just right in terms of creaminess. The chicken was crispy, not Popeye's crispy which was understandable. It was juicy on the inside nevertheless, so this deserves points in my book! Also ordered a fried turnip dish that was pretty decent, though, I thought it was not fried enough. It just didn't have enough crisp to it when I took bites. Maybe I'm just picky with my turnip cakes?"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today, I think the place opened a couple of days ago, not sure when. 

This used to be the old Shoppers Drug Mart and now it's been transformed into another congee, noodle and rice place. 

The menu and prices are very similar to Congee Queen but they have an extra dinner menu, where you get a peking duck plus other dishes, that you choose yourself.  Prices vary according to how many dishes you order.  I think it was $58 for a duck plus 2 dishes. 

We ordered the tureen of seafood congee, a steamed rice roll dish and a fried rice noodle dish.  The food was nice and are very similar in size to Congee Queen.  Service was a bit lacking, not enough staff to cover the restaurant, but it's early days yet.  The staff are really pleasant and welcoming, though.

I would definitely come back again because it's easier for me to get here, than Congee Queen.  Their foods and menus are pretty similar too."}
{"text":"This is baby restaurant - by that I mean they opened too prematurely. Service is subpar. They need to train their staff beforehand and get a hold of teamwork before dealing with customers. When you walk in, you can tell who the managers are with authority, and their employees are shy. 

When I intentionally went to this new place for high tea on a Sunday with my mom, we figured.. new place, we'll order something safe. She ordered a wonton noodle and I ordered a baked tomato sauce pork chop rice. Her's came out almost immediately, while I had to wait about 45 minutes for mine. We had to follow-up on the order twice. My mom said, after following-up the first time is probably when the girl tapped our order into the computer and she didn't bother coming back to apologize or update. While waiting, several tables around us had missing items too - clearly no communication going on behind the counter. Honestly, I thought to myself \"Why didn't I go to Peachtree? Or FMP? At least there, I could've been served in under an hour\".

Also, this was irrelevant to my table, but I heard the table next to us order congee. The staff returned to inform them that they were all out of congee. And get this: they were out of the small congee, but they have Large Bowl congee. ....WHAT? You have congee in your name and you're out of congee?? Well, there's a reason you are MISS congee, y'can't compete with the Kings and the Queens. 

For a HK style restaurant, I did not see a menu for afternoon tea. I thought I'd try asking if it could possibly come with a drink (I later heard other tables asking it too) - \"Not yet\" was the reply. 

Food is mediocre - the wonton had puréed stuffing, not the actual shrimp. While I agree they have an extensive menu, they don't have \"combo\" menus that I personally like to go for - with that, I felt as if they hastily put together the menu so they can get the restaurant opened for business. Not well-thought out, especially with the fierce competition in the neighbourhood. They need to rethink their menu options. Reno & decor is nice, but obviously because they're new. 

I would not come back here, they need to develop. Such a big place too, shame. If i do come back, Id give them at least a year to see if they improve - if they last."}
{"text":"New open. Order a salmon congee and bbq fried rice. The congee was good which I expected. The fried rice was ok. It was lunch time and busy. It took me 3 tries to get hot sauce. Other wise the service is good. Waitress yelling at each other. Funny. I think I'll come again to try something else next time. 

Second time here and the food is pretty good. The really downside is the staff are too slow. Not enough staff also. It takes too long to get what you wanted. 


Third time here. This is the worse of all. Salmon congee has no taste. Baked fish spaghetti so oily and the fish is deep fried. The waiter didn't even say thank you after giving 10% tips. I will never come again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food here I will NEVER COME back ever again. Ordered three dishes, all three of them are disappointments. 
1. Seafood congee : no seafood but charge you seafood price and it is like soup there is no thickness to the congee no actual texture to the congee. 

2. Fried noodles : burnt all over. Tastes like you'll get cancer after you eat a bowl. 

3. Deep fried Yao tiu : not even fried properly, takes like dough. 

Be warned never come. This place won't last. The name doesn't suit the food. Miss congee isn't making congee she is making liquid soup. 

Better off with with congee queen."}
{"text":"If you ever wanted to see ME as a wait staff, you can take a glimpse of my style at Miss Congee.  I'll sit you down at the table and ask what you want next minute.  You want another few minutes, cool I'm gonzo.  

Waving me down, you ask if that dish is good?  Oooh yeah! best in town (if that town has a population of 10).  Next you want me to get the bill?  Let me disappear and forget about it while the \"rookie\" cleans up the table and potentially spill food and tea on you.  

That's right, I take your tea away in an empty restaurant so you won't stay.  Huh, you wanted the bill why didn't you ask? Leaving already?  Please come again. Miss you, bye bye!

The food that I've had is closer to take-out quality, under seasoned over tenderized.  The chicken slices could have been medium tofu.  It's not all bad, but it kind of feels that way.  I have to drive to this plaza just to have a single choice while 2 plazas east and west have multitude of selection.  

Restaurant itself is open, stylish enough and clean-looking which equals one word \"generic\".  There's no doubt this place can be busy on weekends and the first time here I didn't bother lining up and simply drove to another Cantonese restaurant with less lines and better food.  It's not like it's a hyped up Ramen Shop in Markham.  I don't even line up for those, so bad comparison.

I'll let you imagine how the service and food would be if the restaurant was busy.  Wait, maybe you can read other reviews on that.  Why imagine if you don't have to?  Come here if you don't have much choice but remember one TIP, watch the waiters like a hawk and get away from whatever they're holding as far as possible before it has a chance to land on you."}
{"text":"I have given this place two tries and it's a continuous disappointment. The waitresses are tired and not happy. I ordered 5 dishes that are the common fried rice, fried noodles, congee, etc but only 3 dishes came in 45 minutes. There was another table of guests that walked out after waiting too long. It's clear that they're under staffed both on waitress and in the kitchen. Will not return again."}
{"text":"There are many other places that have better congee than here but their noodles and other basic fried rice/flat noodles are ok. The BBQ is ok. Nothing special that you couldn't find elsewhere. Depending on the server, you may need to ask multiple times before you get stuff like knife or water. It's just a good spacious place where you could bring kids, car seat/stroller. No long lines, in/out quickly. We come because it's easy to go home as we would turn right out. Avoid during rush hour if you need to head westbound to go home. Brutal left turn especially with Markham drivers."}
{"text":"The good: the roast pork and honey soya pork dishes are pretty good. The skin on the roast pork is quite crispy, and the honey soya sauce is nice and flavourful.

The bad: I've been here twice now and both times was disappointed with the service. I wrote out the numbers corresponding to the items I wanted to order but the server refused to write the orders down and made me go through the menu again to tell her the names of the dishes I wanted to order. Despite this, she got two of our orders wrong, and one of our orders never came so we eventually asked her to cancel that order.

The ugly: When I asked about the shrimp and mango bird nest that I had ordered, she said they don't make that dish anymore (yet it remains on the menu). Then she asked if we still wanted mango and dished out some mango from a dish from a nearby shelf  that we had sent back because it was wrong. When clearing the plates she noticed the mango was not all eaten then ate from the mango dish on the shelf.

Needless to say, despite the servers' attempts to make up for the initial mistakes in service, I would not advocate coming to this place. 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"After reading all the low reviews, I was ready for some bs as I slowly wandered in here for lunch on a weekday. I was greeted right away by 2 servers and seated immediately. After looking around, I realized how big this restaurant is, not only on the outside but also inside. It's decorated very nicely and it has a modern feel. It also doesn't look sticky and disgusting like most chinese restaurants do. 

We ordered hot milk teas, and I also had this roast duck noodle thingy.. boyfriend ordered the baked chicken portuguese curry rice thingy..? LOL sorry, I have no idea what the real names are. My boyfriend's food was delicious (yes, I snuck some) and the chicken was super crispy and the sauce had a perfect amount of spice. My dish was HUGE- honestly I was stuffed and looked back down at the dish and my boyfriend said it looks like I didn't even start it. It was the small too.. the whole dish could've fed 5 people (with appetites like me) It wasn't amazing but I didn't mind it. The servers came to me 3 times and asked me how I was doing and tried really hard to make conversation. I think they made have had a bit of a crush on me because my bf didn't get the same treatment, I'm flattered :D The menu is huge and offers a lot more than many congee places offer. 

Anyways, miss congee wasn't bad but I only went once, when it wasn't really busy. Everyone I know that has been there in a busier time has also told me that the service is extremely slow.. I'll definitely avoid it during rush hour."}
{"text":"Previous to coming I was a little baffled by the overwhelming negative reviews. My mom wanted to come here for Mother's Day. On Friday came for dinner and had Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice, Beef Chow-Mein, Lobster with Ginger and Green Onion, Roast Pork and Duck, Spicy Fried Squid, Steamed Tilapia, Baby bok choi with mushrooms. Let me say right off the bat, everything was good and authentic (with the exception of the tilapia, which was all soggy and mushy). However, I will say that they are very light on the salt shaker. I'm ok with this but for the vast majority of people this probably won't fly and is likely where a good part of the negative reviews come from. They'll need to change this if they want better reviews. Wait staff was kinda light and not as attentive as I'd prefer. All-in-all I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here first week they opened. Overall a less than mediocre restaurant. Took 45 minutes for 7 dishes to come out.

Ordered a hot pot rice wasn't cooked enough to get the crispy rice. The pot they used had black stains/ink coming off and onto the rice. A major health concern. 

Also ordered veggies, fried noodles and fried tofu. Food was bland and tasteless. On the low end of taste, flavour and quality for a Chinese restaurant in Markham.

Had to ask for the check/receipt from 3 different servers before getting the bill.

Overall a below average and very mediocre experience. Though it's closer, I would not be going back. Save yourself the trouble and drive less than 5 minutes down the street and head to Congee Queen (better taste, faster service, more value).

Do not go to this place unless you want subpar food and service. A ready-made microwavable meal would've been better than this place."}
{"text":"Happy New Year!  Well, almost...  Got less than 2 hrs till to go.  So before the countdown starts and I get to watch some of my friends go insanely drunk, I thought to take some time to post a review before the end of 2015.

Weeks, ago I was along Hwy 7 to catch up on my Xmas shopping and I couldn't help to notice this New Congee place tucked in this plaza along with Dollarama and Danny's Fish and Chips.  It had this cute catchy name : \"Miss Congee\".  As we were passing by, I noticed that the place was quite happening.  Being Curious, I happened to tell my wife, gonna give this place a try someday.  Well tonight, on our way back home from Markville Mall, we gave this place a try.

As we walked into this restaurant, the first impression was pretty good.  The seating arrangements looked clean, spacious and was packed.  The interior design consists of glittering light brown stone brick wall, adequate pot lighting and stained dark brown dividing headboards.  On the far back there's the BBQ glass window showing the hanging BBQ Duck and on the left side there's a fish tank of live fishes swimming around.

The Host quickly seated us as soon as we walked in.  We ended up sitting the bench seating nearby the BBQ Duck Window display.

As we glance through the menu, there were these Lobster Congee $23 and Peking Duck combo special $57.  We did noticed a lot of tables ordering these.  But since there were only 2 of us, we ordered half roast duck and the \"Garlic Wined Ribs\" (Chef Specialty).

The food did came out in 10 mins, so time was good in terms of quickness.  Especially when the restaurant is fully packed.

Now on with the food:
The Roast Duck was ok though for me it was a bit dry.  I'm thinking it was overcooked a bit.

The \"Garlic Wined Ribs\" was lightly coated with Minced Garlic and Deep fried in a batter.  The rib was tender and the texture outside was just right.  Only weird thing was I didn't taste any wine marinate.

So of course you're probably wondering why I gave so low of a score?

1)  Must the kitchen need to hammer the bell every 10 secs?  Really kill the ambience.  Now it feels like a diner more than a restaurant.  I understand food needed to be picked up by the waiter/waitress, but of all the congee places I've been to all the staff are well trained to bring the food out of the kitchen without the bell.  And since we were sitting so close, it annoys the hell outta my wife and I.  Not to mention the staff looks lost everytime the bell goes off.

2) Lack of service.  I don't know if it's because it's New Years Eve and the place is packed with people, some ordering the Peking Duck Combo which needed more attention.  But, it seemed the only attention the waiter/waitress will give us was when we first order and when I decided to pay.  As we finished our meal, my wife wanted to add desserts from the back of the menu.  First we politely waved down the waiter, he said \"Be with you in a minute\" then he ran to seat the people who just walked in through the door and never came back.  We tried to wave down two other waitresses with one saying the same thing and ran right into the kitchen to fetch more dishes out (never came back); the other waitress, completely blew by our table and was busy cleaning out the other table apparently.  So I guess this restaurant don't want more business or what?

Finally since they don't have time for us to order desserts, we decided to call for the bill and headoff.

3)  Remember we ordered the Garlic Wined Ribs (Chef Specialty).  As we got the bill we realized that why we couldn't taste the wine marinate.  Cause according to the receipt we only ordered the regular garlic ribs (without the wine) and to think it wasn't marinated enough.

To me, it's not that the staff doesn't work fast.  I believe there's lack of training, lack of communication and Too much confusion.  I do have faith that there is potential in this establishment, but tonight it was just bleeping madness.  I'm going to give a benefit of the doubt this business is new, but this restaurant can only hide behind the excuse for so long.  I will give a second chance provided they smooth out the service.  I don't like giving low stars but this restaurant just have so much potential if they simply read other comments are probably no different.

{"text":"Came here for dinner not expecting much because of the low reviews but it exceeded my expectations. The food wasn't amazing (Plain rice noodles werent as soft as other places) but it wasn't bad either. Service was pretty good and food arrived fairly quick. Hopefully their food improves as well the next time I come."}
{"text":"There is no reason to come here unless your car broke down infront of it. There are so many other congee restaurants that are better than this place and better priced.

We ordered a bowl of congee, Tiger shrimp E-fu noodles, duck, roasted pig and a plate of veggies.

We were 1 of 2 tables seated. So a quiet night.

Food:
The E-fu noodles were so sad. One of the most expensive e-fu noodles ($14) on their menu and it came with 6 pieces of shrimp, shredded ginger and strips of green onions with some sauce that was tasteless. The whole dish was bland and the noodles were soggy. Good e-fu noodles, to me, have to have some bite to it, some texture. The tiger shrimp was over cooked and tough.

The roasted pig's skin wasn't crispy.

The veggie stocks were literally 1 inch in diameter. They tested your degree of Canadian by practicing being a beaver, chomping on these trees. They were cooked well though. They had a crunch to them and were cooked through which is the way I like.

The congee was congee. And their dough fritters were dough fritters, you can't mess those up having CONGEE written on the front of your restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant, for a place that's named after congee, of course it must be one of the dishes to try out. I ordered a scallop and fish congee and the bowl was of a decent size to share between two people. The congee was smooth and not too salty but there could be a little bit more fish. There was more scallop than I expected. It's topped with chopped green onions and is mixed with slivers of ginger.

Also ordered spicy turnip cake which although was very crispy when it came out, is more rice flour than turnip (however most restaurants serve their turnip cakes like this). I give it an a-ok for its prolonged crispiness.

Lastly ordered a 2 choice bbq meat plate consisting of duck and honey glazed pork. Duck was alright, pork a bit salty. We hoped it came with rice but no dice. Good thing already got congee. 

Overall, nothing too spectacular but not horrible. Waitresses were nice and checked up on us often. It was quite full for a weeknight and many people ordered their lobster. Maybe I will try that next."}
{"text":"We thought we try this restaurant because it was new. It used to be a big name pharmacy. What a mistake! There were many things wrong with it even by Chinese standards. I understand Chinese restaurant have a whole culture to themselves, and we cannot expect too much in terms of service, cleanliness, and class. These joints tend to be efficient but can fill you inexpensively. I don't know why Chinese customers themselves don't demand more from their own restaurants. That said, this particular one was not ready for business. First, the servers didn't know the menu well. Second, the men's bathroom had a strong odour of urine. Third, we had to get the attention of servers a few times before somebody would actually come to us. Fourth, some orders still did not come after we asked the server to check. We asked the manager to cancel but then it came right away. Fifth, we had to send an item back because ingredients were missing. Sixth, some of the foods did not have the standard, expected taste. Seventh, the waiting area was tiny. Eighth, servers (I would say most Chinese servers actually) were not trained to smile or exhibit that engaging interpersonal dimension. Chinese servers are often somewhere between the triangulation of uncaring, grumpy, and impersonal. The only saving grace for this place is the spacious seating. After you squeeze through the tiny waiting area, you will enjoy the spacious seating. Finally, there were not enough high chairs. The table beside us asked for two but only got one. The parents took turns holding the baby the entire time."}
{"text":"Food is decent, service is even worse. The food is not as good as Congee Chan and the service is not even comparable. I have been here twice and both times the waitresses were extremely rude and asked us inappropriate questions at a very unfriendly tone. One of the waitresses that served us looked like she hated life but hated the tables she served even more. Save yourself some time and go to New Kennedy Square or Congee Chan nearby for a better experience."}
{"text":"Miss Congee reminds me of Congee Wong.  Good enough food, okay pricing, okay services, outstanding portion.  The decoration is nice like Congee Queen.

I wished someone had forewarned us of the portion.  Being our first visit, we ordered a noodle (Cantonese Chow Mein $10.50), a rice (Beef Tofu Rice $7.95), and a Sesame Chicken ($9.95) to share among the three of us.  Guess what? The chow mein was huge.  It alone could satisfy the carb craving of *all* of us.  The supposedly one-person portioned Beef Tofu Rice can feed 1.5 person of average appetite.  I felt embarrassed that we ordered three items, and we doggy bagged all three.

Food quality wise, the tofu was first quality, very fresh and smooth.  The beef was okay.  The chow mein tasted fine.  There were a lot of ingredients.  It tasted very similar to the same noodle at Congee Wong.  I don't mind ordering the chow mein again.  The Sesame Chicken was too sweet; otherwise, it was decent.  All items were loaded with MSG.  Consider yourself forewarned.  

It was not a busy night.  It was easy to wave down a server.  The services was typical of Chinese restaurants: effective, efficient, matter-of-fact.

At time of grand opening, people told me Miss Congee was not so good, so I waited for the growing pain to be over.  It paid off.  Being a better value than Congee Queen, of which the food tastes better but of smaller portion, Miss Congee has craved its survival space in this hyper competitive area.  Let's hope customers would give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Everything from cleanliness and staff are wonderful.  Menu has so many options, you'll have no idea what to choose (I think there are a couple hundred items on there!).   Love the fresh selection of BBQ pork, seafood, peking duck, plus all the usual HK chinese food.  My favourite was the soft shell crab rice (not spicy like Congee Queen or other places) and Singapore rice noodle.  The portions are nice and large, and inexpensive.

Best part I think was that the staff are so friendly and sharp.  It's rare to find this in an authentic Chinese restaurant.  I feel very comfortable eating here.  This restaurant is in the plaza with Dollarama on Hwy7 between Kennedy & McCowan.  Plenty of parking here.

Do not let the low ratings discourage you from trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Shots fired. In fact, many shots fired with all these 1 star reviews. But I think the dust has settled and I was finally brave enough to give Miss Congee a try. 

First impression, the place is way too huge for it to support. If the place was half the size it would still be big enough. The menu is very extensive and way too much variety for one place to handle let alone a new restaurant trying to establish a customer base. 

Came here on a Saturday morning/afternoon at around 11:30am. The place was only a quarter full with customers but then again its still a lot of customers since this place is so large.

I'm not too sure how busy it was before but being only a quarter full of customers is pretty bad for a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday morning. I'm pretty sure the poor star reviews has scared away many customers.

I for one had a pretty good experience here. We ordered the lobster congee combo for $23.95 (Comes with selection of rice roll so we went with beef rice roll and also deep fried batter sticks). The congee came in a large bowl and an actual whole lobster. I was expecting only some small chunks so bonus points for this. The lobster was small but already exceeded my expectations. The beef rice roll was smooth and soft and had a good portion of beef inside. The batter sticks were light and crispy just like they should be. All the above food was excellent. 

Also ordered beef rice noodle with XO sauce for $10.50 - this dish was pretty average but tasted good so no real complaints here.

Service was cold but fast and efficient. We had lobster shells all over our plates and they even replaced our plates without us asking.

This place has had a rough start but I'm gonna be that guy and give this place a 3.5 stars. There is no half stars on Yelp so I will rate it a 4 just to give it a bump up on the overall review.

I think this places deserves a lot more than the average 1.5 star at this point in time. It probably does deserve all those one star reviews in the past. I was analyzing this place with a fine tooth comb to find any faults I could, but the cold service was the only real downfall I experienced. Don't be discouraged with all the poor reviews and give this place a try."}
{"text":"If you have been to any one of the restaurants with Congee + [noun] restaurants (Congee Time, Congee Queen, Congee Wong...) you will know exactly what to expect. The menu is overflowing with options, the portions are fairly generous, and the quality is pedestrian. They can take out the MSG on many menu items. This means you will take a hit on the flavour. 

They have a passable BBQ meat selection. 

All that said, I quite like the restaurant. You know exactly what you will be getting, they will do it quickly, and they will do so competently. It's Chinese comfort food, which is all good."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place ever since I saw them put up their sign. I kept my eye on it as they continued to finish the building. Eventually I grew tired of stalking... I mean, waiting for the grand opening, and of course once that happens they open up and I don't realize that until a month later.

I came on a Friday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised at their extensive menu, but it didn't end up being the best quality food.

Staff: I didn't have the same experience with staff that other reviewers seemed to have had. They greeted us quickly at the door and then seated us quickly. I had just returned from a trip, and while I didn't have jetlag mentally, my stomach was in a completely different time zone and I was starving. So it was a really good thing the food came quickly, otherwise I would have been a grouch (moreso than I am on a regular basis).

Ambience: It was comfortable and pretty quiet but that may also be because it was a Friday afternoon.

Food: This was the first time I saw a menu with a Duck, BBQ Pork & Wonton Noodle Soup. All I ever wanted was to have more options with my wontons and this place provided that option, and so I just had to order it. I wish there was a size option though, because I could've used a lot more noodles and fixings in my dish. The duck was nice and fatty, the pork was flavourful, and while the wontons were nice and big, they were quite salty. In addition, I ordered their Beef and Dough Fritter Rice Roll, and that proved to be a mistake. The beef lacked flavour and had a crumbly texture and the dough fritter was soggy. Not sure how that dish went so wrong.

Overall, I'd try the menu again because they have a lot of options that interest me but will probably avoid the rice rolls next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fairly new compared to the rest of highway 7 congee ones, but my family and I decided to come and try it anyways. The food is very similar to Power King in New Kennedy Square.

Other than that, the food was good and the waitress was helpful in terms of recommending food. Unfortunately that day, I was wearing white pants and while she was packing up our fish, some of the soy sauce splashed on my pants. I knew she saw it happen, but she didn't say sorry. On top of that, when we decided to tip her, she was complaining about the amount of tip we gave her. I believe tip is a reflection in how great the service was and the service wasn't great considering the sauce spill."}
{"text":"The congee base is  good.  Place  looks clean but  table surface was sticky.  The  kidney liver congee we ordered had great live but ewww kidney.  I don't think they did a great job viewing up the organs do the kidneys sticky  tasted like pee.  Their  rice rolls were  good. Service good.  They have Chinese BBQ too,  which smelled great but we didn't try ."}
{"text":"3.5/5: I can't believe as a Yelper I came to a 2 star restaurant...such a Yelp snob. BUT I did give this place a chance as it wasn't my choice. There is lots of seating in the restaurant and very spacious. The menu had a lot of options. We went with a set menu with Lobster and other side dishes. The complimentary soup was like any other. I wasn't impressed with the BBQ selection, probably because it was the scraps they don't sell served with the set menu. The only dish I was very impressed with was the ginger and onion lobster. Usually for set menus, you do not get big lobsters. For some reason our dish was quite large! Lots of meat to eat from the lobsters. Every other dish was enjoyable (Sweet & Sour Pork, Snow Peas & Mushrooms and Steamed Fish). We also got Taro Sago dessert which was a pleasant surprise!

The service was also very good. The server came by many times, and she even wished us a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays as we left. I don't think this restaurant deserves such a low score since I quite enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to come and try miss congee at first after hearing from friends and family how poor this place was.  However on my visit I found it to not be as poor as my expectations.

 I had a baked chicken steak rice with tomato sauce and an iced almond milk.

The almond milk was very powdery and I would highly suggest avoiding this.  They did get the less ice and sugar part right so I can't say it was completely failing.

The chicken rice was actually pretty decent.  I usually like the 'sketchy HK Cafe' taste so this hit the spot for me.  I'd have to say if you were looking quality then you'll probably find this rice dish to be pretty disappointing.  The fried rice base was just egg fried rice (I find consistent with cheap cha chan tang) so definitely not a lot of ingredients.

Overall service was also sufficient and was not as poor as previously experienced by friends.  I don't think I would return on my own (came with family) and they seem to find it ok."}
{"text":"To think that this Chinese restaurant would be good because of the ambiance and how clean the place is but man food was horrible. Ordered bbq pork rice was a mountain tall, sliced pork so thin . Ordered garlic with choy, it was so different from the usual one super water didnt taste like garlic at all.  Server didnt know the names of the dish or how to write em that we have to show them the menu so she could write it. Just very weird compared to other \"congee\" restaurant. Wont come back unfortunately"}
{"text":"Service is really really bad. Food is fair. Not good as the other congee. Bad attitude with their waitress. We got a  wrong order of the food. We tell them. They are really bad attitude about their wrong order. Really bad experience. Will not come again. And the congee has uncooked rice in too."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre but pricey.  

One good thing is the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch with the family at this relatively new place on hwy 7 and kennedy. Their concept similar to congee queen nearby but their menu isnt as extensive (No pho though). 

We ordered three items. The liver congee was pretty good but the bowl is small and can only feed about a group of 4. Their Yingyang rice was so-so; the ketchup was too sour and needed some sugar. The turnip patties were not spicy but fresh and hot. There were some chicken and shrimp bits but the overall plate quantity is smaller than congee queen but turnip cubes are larger in size. Patties were slightly overburned. Overall mediocre food. 

HA service.. What service? Waitresses kind of wander around and chitchat on floor and they are not the most attentive. Its ironic that our table didnt get much service and yet there are so many waitresses on floor lol. Definitely needs to be retrained. 

THE FUNNIEST THING was as we were leaving the parking lot, one of the waitresses came out looking for someone cause apparantly they got the order wrong for one of the customer's takeout... Lol hope they find him/her. 

Wont be back."}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible. We asked for our food that was 30 minutes late, and it never came. And there wasn't even a lot of ppl at the place"}
{"text":"If I can give no star, I will totally gave no star

This new place is a mess.  Waitresses doesn't know the table number. 
After order the food and need to wait so long.
And the food finally arrived, the fried rice wasn't hot any more it was just warm. 
The food wasn't good.  The rice was way overcook and burned."}
{"text":"Talking about an extensive menu! Miss Congee has everything!

Congee, Noodle, HK Style Western Food, Cantonese Stir Fried and more. A menu that has so many choices it took my dinner mate so long and still could not figure out what to order. 

Being new, the interior is spacious and nicely decorated. Servers working hard and willing to please. Being new, quite a few items may not be available, including the Double Steamed Ginger Milk Dessert.

Assorted Tofu Served in a Hot Pot ($11.50) 
Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice ($9.50)

Both tasted A-OK. 

Definitely will be back to have some congee and steamed rice roll.

Accepts credit and debit cards."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. The place was very nicely renovated with many seats so there is probably never a time where you have to wait for a seat. The menu had a large range of selection. It had a very comfortable setting. The only problem is that the service was a little slow. The waitresses did not seem like they cared about you at all and they were just rushing all over the place. 
The food was okay. We ordered the tofu clay pot, beef with chinese broccoli and a plate of bbq duck and pork. The tofu clay pot was really good, the fish tasted fresh. The beef with chinese broccoli was decent. But the bbq duck and pork was just not up to par. It was just lacking in flavour and it was really dry. I also ordered a red bean with vanilla ice cream drink but instead they just gave me a red bean drink. I was too lazy to tell them since the service was slow and the waitresses didn't really care. At the end of the meal, they gave us each a bowl of red bean dessert soup which was pretty generous. Overall, I rated them a 3/5. Would've been a 2.5/5 but Yelp doesn't have half stars. The food was okay, but the service was not as great. I would just rather go to Congee Queen than here."}
{"text":"First time here. Foods is below average. The only thing is hot when arrested at our table is the congress everything else is cold. 

The basic thing about Chinese foods in a restaurant are need to arrive at the customer table hot not cold"}
{"text":"I am incredibly dissatisfied with both the service and quality of food. I asked for curry shredded chicken on rice, and was given crispy chicken with tomato sauce.  Not only did they get my order (type of protein and sauce) wrong, but they also didn't even offer to replace the dish. Anyways, I tried the dish out and it tasted terrible - didn't even finish half. 

Aside from that mishap, the congee was very bland. 

Miss Congee? Nope. Missed the point."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this got low stars but this place is the bomb.

Wanted good old yummy chinese food then this place has it.

The sweet and sour pork was delish. It easy so crispy and of course they have my fave, turnip patties!

People are nice here too. I would come back for sure"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family on a Friday night. There was a lot of people waiting when we walked in which made me think that this place was good. But little did we know, there were problems with every aspect of this business. I think much of it stems from them being understaffed and overwhelmed. 
1) The servers - Our main server got an item on our order wrong, and dared to blame us for her mistake. She later apologized but you shouldn't blame the customer for your own mistake. I suspect that the waitress is under a lot of pressure and they probably threaten to dock her pay over incorrect orders even though it is human nature. 
2) The service - What service? There was no service. Took us forever to get a pot of hot water and we were so crammed at our table because the empty dishes were not taken away. 
3) The food - Bleurgh. The congee was watery; the fried dough was too toasted/burnt (which they repackaged into our fried dough with rice rolls), and the vegetables we ordered were bathed in oil. Their BBQ duck and pork were good though but you can't go wrong with that. 
4) The bill - When the bill came, we noticed that they had overcharged us for something and notified the manager. He proceeded to try to argue with us that he gave us a \"little more\" hence why we were charged more, even though we clearly stated the amount that we wanted when we ordered. Have they never heard the saying that the customer is always right? Geez.

...How can a congee place be this bad?! I wonder how long they will last..."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my family. Menu is typical of Chinese restaurants. Prices are standard as well. The service was pretty bad. Every time I asked for something I was ignored. I had to get my own cutlery and hot sauce. We ordered two lobsters. We saw them drop it to the wrong table. When they realized it was ours they brought it but there was only 1 lobster not two! We were told we would get free soup. It never came. When we complained it came at the end of dinner. We asked for out cake to be put in the fridge, we were ignored. At the end when the bill came we felt they did not deserve a lot of tip. On a $168 dinner plus HST came to around $200 we gave them $15 tip. The waitress then complained it was to little and we need to pay more tip! We did just to get out of there but would never return back! Would rather go to congee queen where service and food is consistent! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner with my friend. 

We ordered:

Scallop and fish slice congee 5.95
- congee had enough toppings 
Turnip cake 6.50
- it was deep fried 
2 choices of BBQ 10.95 
- very saucy, did not enough it too much

It was pretty typical, not bad. Service was good, very attentive."}
{"text":"Do not come here during rush hour. Waited for food for almost an hour for a congee restaurant is totally unacceptable"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night and it was packed! There was no hostess to take down any names for tables unless you actually call them out. We waited for about half an hour before getting a table, which were two cups short. It was a mission getting the attention of these servers! 

We ordered soft shell crab fried rice, crab meat thick soup, salt and pepper shrimp, mushroom tofu with broccoli, and sweet and sour pork. 

The sweet and sour pork was nice and crispy, we could tell that they didn't use red colouring like other restaurants. The salt and pepper shrimp was SALTY. Mind you, my father suggested to them nicely when we were done our meal that they should use less salt and the waitress walked away as he was speaking with no response. (RUDE!!!) 

The soft shell crab fried rice never came. We asked the waitress and they said it was never made, so we cancelled it. No apologies what so ever. 

Waitresses need alot more training with customer service. Chefs need to figure out their recipes and what they want to serve as their menu was like reading a novel. Unfortunately their only one good dish isn't enough for us to return in the future."}
{"text":"Terrible service and small portion size definitely stay away. We came at 7:30pm and they had no big bowl congee only the small ones wtf? Dishes we ordered were horribly small and still charged regular price. We ordered typical wet noodles with beef and the flat noodles was just dry and didnt have enough sauce. We ordered the Honey Beef Ribs and each piece was 80% fat with no meat, when we confronted the manager he said it was normal and only until we pressed further did he remove it from the bill. Needless to say we sent it back. The food definitely does not taste good and dont be fooled by the hype, there's only a wait because its new, feel sorry for those who wait to eat at this sad excuse of a restaurant. Sorry but Miss Congee is no Congee Queen.."}
