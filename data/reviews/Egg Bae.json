{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to try this place and went for brunch on Saturday morning.
The place was comfy and funky. You order at the counter and then wait for your number to be called. And wait. And wait. It seemed to take a very long time but when our food arrived it was fresh. I had the Bae-sic and she had the one with smoked salmon and we each had a coffee and a hash brown on the side.
The sandwiches were fresh and flavourful and far too salty. The hash brown was fresh and crisp and obscenely salty. Both our hash browns went almost uneaten.
As I was carrying the tray to the counter, a woman behind the counter asked me how the food was and I told her it was way too salty. She said they did not add salt to anything, and was quickly corrected by the woman beside her who said yes they do. And boy do they ever. The bun, the sausage patty, the eggs, the sauce, the potato, everything is dialed to 11 on the sodium scale.
I do not normally comment on the price which is reasonable considering the house-made ingredients theme they have going, but it makes no sense to shell out 40 bucks when you could get robo food from a chain resto which is inexplicably less salty for a quarter of the price.

I wanted to like this place, and did like it, but someone needs to raid the kitchen and lock the salt shaker in the safe away from the chef."}
{"text":"Was going to be 3-3.5 stars but the dope soundtrack they were bumping (hit 90's rap) elevates it to a 4 star in my eyes.

Honestly, the sandwich was great. I got the meatless \"Bae Don't Kale My Vibe\" (yes, every sandwich had a cute pun name). Every component of it was tasty - but I feel like the crispy tofu really didn't add much.
Delicious house made bun, perfectly cooked egg, nice sauce. 

I won't be coming back though. Maybe this speaks more to my budget than anything else, but the sandwich is pretty small for the price (over $10 after tax). It left me wanting more, except I also couldn't justify the $3 hashbrown and/or the $3 coffee.

Stop by for a sandwich though. It's worth it once!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast sandwiches with fantastic hash-browns, with some caveats.

1. First, the food is great. We had one Bae Sic (pork belly) and one Seaside Bae (Salmon)
2. The Bae Sic's pork belly was good, like a high quality sausage patty. The Bae sauce and Muenster cheese while really flavourful, it gets messy fast. Get napkins.
3. The hash browns here are awesome. Really well seasoned, crisp and tasty. If you go early enough on a Saturday or Sunday, you can get a hash brown filled with cheese from a \"secret menu\". They sell out fast. But don't worry, the regular stuff is great enough. 
4. Ok, the wait can be long. We're talking 45 minutes long. That can seem a bit long for a breakfast sandwich, but hey, they're pretty much worth it. That being said...
5. The service side on this is definitely under developed and could use some work. For example: the way the cashier communicated the wait time was less in a helpful way, and had more of in a discouraging tone. We actually saw people before us and after us leave because she did such a good job of convincing them that it wasn't worth the wait. As mentioned earlier, it's definitely worth the wait.
6. But again, they can do more with the wait times. We were sitting outside when our sandwiches were done, and had we not gone back in to check on the sandwiches, they could've been sitting on the counter untouched for a while(despite being told they'd bring it to us). 
7. And not to beat a dead horse, but we're in Kensington Market. Mobile ordering and text notifications aren't new technology, let people order food and then let them walk around the market till their food is done and ready. 
8. Finally, be really aware of the menu prices. Two sandwiches, two hash browns, and two coffees cost nearly $40. The food is good, fresh and locally sourced, but this is on the steep end of pricing. Future visits might see us skipping the hash browns and coffee because $40 for counter service food is hard to routinely justify. But hey, try this place once at least. You might see the value in routinely visiting.

Finally, one last thing of note, like so many other places in Kensington Market, the vibe inside is on point. With fun art, neon signs, and a wall mural, the atmosphere is a good experience.. if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"Let me explain the 3 stars:

The first time I went by this place, it was busy.  They ran out of bread so they told me to come back in 15-20 minutes.  I came back and they told me they were sold out.  That's just great.  If I should've ordered and come back, I should've been given those instructions.  Instead, I left disappointed. Twice.  I was told that I would have a better experience next time, guaranteed.  

I went again but there were significantly less people.  I ordered two sandwiches and a hash brown. The sandwiches were really good.  The bread was soft and pillowy, the eggs perfectly made... I had the seaside bae and thinking back, I don't believe there were any potato chips in mine.  There was no crunch.  Oh well... I was disappointed with the hash brown.  It was dry.  Some of the potato seemed barely cooked.  There was no seasoning.  If I didn't have the ketchup, it would've been just barely passable.  

I'd go back for a sandwich for sure but they need to improve on their communication with customers.  Pass on the cardboard hash brown."}
{"text":"Rating - 4.0/5.0

I came here this past weekend with great anticipation that this place could possibly be the best breakfast sandwich ever.

For those who have been to LA or Las Vegas, you may have tried Eggslut. Lot of folks have been comparing Egg Bae with Eggslut and I must say that Egg Bae definitely takes the crown.

Right when you walk in, your attention immediately goes to the large graffiti like mural on the side wall.

Egg Bae takes pride in making everything in house from their fresh buns, meats and premium condiments just to name a few.

Bae-Sic (4.5/5.0) - My personal favourite which comes with a fried egg, in-house pork belly sausage, tomato jam, slow cooked onions, muenster cheese, and their special bae sauce. I was definitely taken away by how all the ingredients worked so well together without being too over the top. The pork belly sausage was super flavourful with a nice spicy kick. The tomato jam and muenster cheese brought all the elements together. And last but definitely not the least, their fresh made buns were perfectly toasted on the outside, nicely buttered with an airy texture on the inside.

Eh Bae Bae (4.0/5.0) - This was a made for the BLT lover that is elevated with premium toppings. A safe choice that will be popular amongst many folks.

Sea-Side (3.5/5.0) - This was definitely a creative breakfast sandwich. It has a house cured citrus pepper salmon, layered with salt and vinegar potato chips. I thought the tartness from the vinegar and citrus pepper was a bit too overpowering. But it may be a hit to some people."}
{"text":"Was expecting a line or a crowd, but was deceptively quiet. Beautiful outdoor space to eat your food, well, quiet and a picnic bench which is rare in the market. We were a bit nervous at spending $10+ for a breakfast sandwich, but it was worth it. Pillowy bun, soft spice/heat. Messy so you'll want to sit to eat. Cashier was friendly but a little aggressive trying to upsell; it's a soft open, chill. Bathroom clean. Would go back! Free wifi"}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a bit skeptical since it seemed like just a regular breakfast sandwich but at a higher price. However, I was really blown away by how delicious it was (it was un-bae-lievable, haha). 

I got the \"Bae-Sic\" and every component of it was great. I especially liked the Bae Sauce, which was slightly tangy with a bit of a kick. This really helps differentiate it from breakfast sandwiches at other places. The fried egg was cooked perfectly and the yolk seeped into the bun nicely (I'm glad they wrap up the sandwiches so well because it was messy to eat with all the runny yolk). While I usually hate tomatoes, the tomato jam added a subtle sweetness that added a unique flavour to the mix. I also got the hashbrown which was just OK. Kinda small for the price and nothing about it was out of the ordinary. 

If there's any drawback to Egg Bae, it's actually the space itself. It was super loud with fans running and it was honestly a bit hard to hear people talking even if they're at the same table. It was also super super hot in the restaurant, but there's a picnic table in the front for those who want to eat outside. Overall, I'm ready to go back and get myself another sandwich!"}
{"text":"I really love this little place in Downtown-T, the menu is small but that's goes to show that they know what's they're doing. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the sandwiches as a whole hits every spot going down and you don't feel stuffed afterwards. The side of hash browns offered are crispy yet soft on the inside and they're not greasy at all! If you are in this area, this place is definitely worth checking out. Will do so again before I leave!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich in Toronto. I recommend the sausage one. 

New favourite breakfast joint. 

Stop reading. Go here now."}
{"text":"We came here on the Grand opening day (not knowing in advance). 
This place is very new, and definitely has some kinks to work out in service time.
We were given a number and were advised it was a 45 min wait.  Once we were allowed in, we placed order and it was still about 10-15 mins before our actual food was ready. 
The food was 4 but service time brought down .. will look forward to going back once they've figured out the timing :)
However, all that aside, the sandwiches were a decadent treat!
We ordered one bae-sic and one egg bae bae.
The buns are so soft and delicious, and the perfect bun to hold in the goodness inside !!

The bae-sic comes with a pork belly sausage and a sweet tomato jam, and melty Muenster cheese topped with a medium fried egg.. one bite in, and the yolk runs and covers the whole sandwich!

The egg bae bae came with delicious sweet bacon, tomato, arugula , with scrambled egg, and again.. the ooey gooey melted Muenster cheese!!

These were a welcome treat on a Sunday and we'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Egg Bae is located on the east side of Augusta Ave between Baldwin and Dundas in Kensington Market.

Finally, an all-out breakfast sandwich place dedicated to making non typical breakfast sandwiches.  I was driving north along the Florida Turnpike a couple months back and stopped at one of the rest areas in West Palm Beach.  This rest stop had an Earl of Sandwich and part of their slogan is that they make the world's best hot sandwiches or something to that effect.  With the bold claim aside it takes a lot to say you make the world's best anything and in reality the sandwich they served while good wasn't anything to gush over in my opinion.

Now, if that place were to make a breakfast sandwich anywhere near as good as Egg Bae then I'd say perhaps you can falsely still claim you have the world's best hot sandwiches but you'd still be wrong.  My point is that this place, Egg Bae, although they're hella more humble than that Earl of Sandwich is by far much better quality and much closer to the claim of being the best since they're simply better than the ones that self-proclaim they're the best.

While I only ordered a single Eh Bae Bae, what I like are the finer details.  The Eh Bae Bae is listed as follows:  \" Soft Scrambled Eggs, Sweet and Spicy Bacon, Muenster Cheese, Tomato, Arugula, Pickled Shallots, Bae Sauce\".  The eggs are fluffy, tasty and cooked perfectly.  They're not overcooked, undercooked, rubbery or the wrong texture but rather pretty much as Goldilocks as you can get.  The bread, all baked in house, rolled, cut, proofed, baked.  I saw as they were moving the uncooked buns apparently to keep their production going.  Ingredients?  Meat that looks to be of higher quality.  I mean they're in Kensington Market.  There's no excuse to be using meat that's not of great quality if you're going to go to the trouble of making fresh on premise made bread and the fluffy, consistent eggs and match that up with mediocre bacon.  The bacon was even cooked just right in that not to soft and not to hard perfect Goldilocks zone.  

Everything about this sandwich was simply perfect.  I can't really say there was anything about it that I didn't like in the end.  The sandwich had a bit of kick, it must be that bae sauce?  Now for a sandwich that costs upwards of 10 bucks keep in mind this is not an Egg McMuffin or cardboard biscuit from Tim Horton's, no, this is a quality product through and through.

The place is basically geared towards being able to gram this experience.  Each table has their IG account posted as well as on the main menu.  Also the way the sandwich is presented on a tray, angled up and prewrapped - let's just say this is part of the service.  Having the sandwich half wrapped like they have been doing burgers in California for years is just the way to go.  Not only do you get to eat the sandwich and not get your hands dirty but you also get to keep it together but whatever doesn't stay in and falls out can be eaten afterwards since they also give you a fork to be able to finish it all.  Nice touch I have to say.  

So easily this is one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had with freshly made bread, perfectly cooked ingredients and a bit of something something that just makes them a cut above your everyday establishment because Egg Bae just seems to be on a different level."}
{"text":"Canada's version of EggSlut.. But more polite and cute. I had the seaside bae, and a hash brown, which were both delicious. I heard they do stuffed hash browns as part of a secret menu but decided to keep that for my next visit. My order this time was perfect. The combination of soft eggs and the crispy chips made my mouth happy; and the smoked salmon worked so well with the perfect egg Bun. Made me feel like I was back in the Bay Area! Great first experience though and will return."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast sandwiches with a twist! Had the Seaside Bae and hash brown - packed with sooo much flavour. Can't wait to try every single one off the menu"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch one weekend and was pleasantly surprised. Eggbae is a small restaurant by Kensington Market serving a variety of (egg) sandwiches. I personally love \"breakfast\" sandwiches and was thrilled to hear that they opened a restaurant dedicated exactly to that!

We ordered the bae-sic and seaside bae - both very different but very delicious. The bae-sic is served with a fried egg, pork belly sausage, slow cook onions, cheese and bae sauce. Needless to say I made a huge mess trying to eat it haha. The seaside bae, made with scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, chips(!) shallot and arugula, was my favourite (and now all-time favourite breakfast sandwich). Adding the potatoes chips was also a fantastic idea as it added a much needed crunch to the sandwich. I was also happy to learn that the bun were prepared fresh in house as well as the smoked salmon. This speaks volumes about their commitment to quality food. 

Unfortunately we came during the soft launch and the hashbrowns were not available. I saw some pics on it and will definitely be back soon to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and even though there were less than 25 reviews, I had to see if this place had a twist on the breakfast sandwich. From the name alone, you can assume that they make it their way. The decor and the name also got me curious.

When you enter the place, it basically screams \"millennial\" everywhere in their decor. I love the chicks all over the walls, the fun atmosphere, and of course the ig worthy bench/sign. The music that was playing was also great. Hip hop music. Reminded me of high school. 

I ordered the eh bae bae (creative name btw). The pickled shallots intrigued me. I've never had that in a breakfast sandwich before. After you order, there is a pretty significant wait. I only had one person in front of me and it still took over ten minutes to fulfill my order.

After biting into the sandwich, you realize that the pickled shallots was something that was needed a while ago. It gave the egg a nice acid and kick to it. I absolutely loved it, but I'm biased to anything pickled. 

I would say that the prices are high for what is basically an egg sandwich, but I think their flavors are on point and it's worth a try if you are ever in the neighborhood or Toronto."}
{"text":"There was a time that I used to make eggs at home. Sometimes they were fluffy, sometimes hard boiled, sometimes I just messed things up and just had em scrambled.

Never again. I ate at EggBae and it's ruined my experience eating at home forever. Thanks EggBae. Your sandwiches are too good and now I can't enjoy the simple things in life."}
{"text":"I visited Egg Bae on a Sunday afternoon, there was no line up and plenty of seats available to choose and sit at. 

The staff seemed friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the classic Egg Bae and my boyfriend ordered the Seaside Bae. It took around 10 minutes for both our orders to be made. 

The bun was well buttered and soft and they were generous with the Muenster cheese. I felt like the sandwich was flavourful and indulgent, I liked the texture of the soft scrambled eggs and the buttery bun. I tried a bite of the Seaside Bae but preferred the classic Egg Bae a bit more just because I wasn't craving smoked salmon. 

Egg Bae was a great place to try out for brunch and the wall art inside was extra cute and photogenic!  We took many pictures and the lighting was great. Most people might be full but we have big appetites so we were still a little hungry after one sandwich.  

Super cute place and yummy, definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Four of us went there around 10:30 AM on a Saturday morning and found it's almost filled-up with people. Luckily we could find an empty table. Nice interior deco and up-beat ambience! They also have few outside seating arrangements.

We ordered two \"The Egg Bae\"s, two \"Seaside Bae\"s and hash browns, but ended up getting two \"Bae Sic\"s, two \"Seaside Bae\"s and hash browns. They mixed up our oder between  \"The Egg Bae\" and the \"Bae Sic\" which costs more. So we ended up paying more. After my companions complained, they offered to fix the order which would take at least 30 minutes (as per the server since it was a busy time). So we declined as we were on a rush but the server was nice enough to serve us two free muffins (interestingly I did not see that one the menu) which was very nice of him. The muffins tasted delicious. They serve regular coffee (I asked for it as I did not see it on the menu which listed only the organic coffee and organic tea) in addition to organic coffee.

The sandwiches tasted great. But they were a little bit on the greasy side for my taste. Keep lots of tissues handy otherwise it can get messy.  The has browns were big and tasty but a little overcooked for me."}
{"text":"New sandwich shop in town! 

Cute and colourful graffiti wall, a few tables (10-15 seats?) inside, with a picnic bench outside when the weather's nice! 

We got the kale one, the bae-sic, the eh bae bae, hash browns, and tea (genuinetea). Overall they were really flavorful and delicious, but a little heavy on the bae sauce (similar to a sriracha mayo) which, with the egg yolk, made for a very goopy mess when we got to the bottom, so take a few extra napkins! The three sandwiches were almost indistinguishable after the first few bites. 

Everything is made in house (except for the ketchup with the hashbrown). My favourite part was the bread, it's eggy and dense, similar to a brioche, and it sops up the egg and the sauce really well. The hashbrown was also a bit salty, but super crispy on the outside! 

Sandwiches range around $9, hash brown was around $3, and overall our bill came to approx. $40 for 3. 

They are still in their soft opening, with their grand opening happening on May 27th."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sandwiches! I ordered the egg bae, although the buns are a bit bitter, other than that, everything is made right!"}
{"text":"I came here for the grand opening and the place did not fail to impress.

There was a bit of a wait time, we were all handed a number. Once our number was called, we got our chance to order.

I ordered the Bae Don't Kale My Vibe Sandwich.

The first bite... I fell in love. The combination of flavours just infused together and made love in your mouth. I loved every moment of eating it. I'm drooling just by the thought of re-living the moment.

The interior is nice, has street art meets basic. They have a photo booth area where you can take your social pic and a mural on the wall to entertain your eyes.

It was a delightful visit with amazing staff.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome place for some tasty and innovative breakfast sandwiches. Located on a side road, you probably wouldn't even know this place was here unless you had a chance encounter (or read Yelp reviews ). Walking in, we were greeted by bright colors and a cute mural painted on the wall. For breakfast, I ordered the \"bae-sic\" sandwich which had Muenster cheese, sausage, over easy egg and their special bae sauce and hubby ordered the \"eh bae bae\" sandwich, which was essentially the same as mine, with bacon instead of sausage and scrambled eggs with tomato. We also got a hash brown on the side. Both were very fresh and so delicious - one of the best breakfast sandwiches we have had.

OH and also, I got a free cookie for wearing red on Canada Day! Added bonus! 

Overall a great experience - would def recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"The Seaside Bae is my favourite.  I don't have a sweet tooth but rather a salty one so the Seaside does it for me.  The crunchy texture from the salt&vinegar shreds and all the flavours from it are crazy!  Chef Wallace is on point with his restaurant and these are super good sandwiches!   If you're in Kensington Market at all, check them out!"}
{"text":"I came here last weekend during their soft opening phase and surprisingly, it wasn't busy. I expect that to change soon though because of the exposure they've been getting from Toronto media blogs and their growing Instagram following!

Upon walking in, this small place had a noticeably cute wall mural and some tables for eating in. There was also a cute pink neon sign by the counter for cute photos.

For those that haven't heard, this place specializes in delicious breakfast sandwiches that are stuffed with different meats and toppings between freshly baked soft buns. These breakfast sandwiches are a good size and definitely stuffed with more than just your average Tim Hortons or McDonald's breakfast sandwiches.

My husband and I got the seaside bae and the bae-sic sandwiches, as well as a hash brown. The seaside bae was made up of cured salmon, scrambled egg, arugula, chips, pickled shallots, and herbed mayo. It definitely suited the name - it was flavourful with just the right amount of salt and blend of herbs. 

The bae-sic sandwich was anything but - it had pork belly sausage, fried egg, cheese, onions, tomato jam and their bae sauce which had a nice slight spice to it. Although we liked the seaside bae, this one was the definite winner between the two because of that sauce!

The hash brown was also tasty in its deep fried goodness and surprisingly filling for its small portion. It was a great side to the breakfast sandwiches we had. 

The only (sort of) downsides were the price (almost $30 for the 3 items) and that the items were really oily. Then again, that's expected with all the deep fried items and despite the price, we really enjoyed our meal. 

Overall, it fits right in with the Kensington vibe and it's comfort food at its oiliest. Wishing this place lots of success and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"So I've been to LA a few times and tried out Egg Slut which I fell in love with so  I was pretty excited when I saw that a similar restaurant would be opening up in Kensington Market. I ended up ordering the Seaside Bae and it did not disappoint as the buns were soft and fluffy and the combination of ingredients went well together. My only complaint is looking back now, I don't think there were any potato chips in my sandwich as advertised. This may have not been a one time thing based on the other reviewers here who ordered the same sandwich."}
{"text":"I attended Egg Bae's Grand Opening Event today, arriving about  1/2 hour before the 9 am start.  There were only 2 people who arrived before me so I was the 3rd person to order, and I chose their Seaside Bae which along with their other Bae choices was comp. for the 1st 50 people to order on their opening day with the purchase of a hash brown.  Everything was delicious: the sandwich was filled with a pickled vegetable, onion, eggs, salmon and potato chips(!) and even the bun was scrumptious.  When biting into and tasting the salmon, I literally felt like I'd been transported to the seaside, it was that fresh-tasting.  The hash brown looked and tasted so crisp and flavourful.

The service was quite friendly and I was pleased that after I finished my meal, a Staff Member asked me what sandwich I had chosen and how did I like it? The décor of the venue is quite bright with colourful murals, pillows and paintings abundant.  It's a fairly small venue which of course is typical for the Kensington Market neighbourhood but - also typical of many other neighbourhood venues - they have a small patio; theirs is a front patio which gently slopes toward the sidewalk.  I highly recommend stopping by and I definitely want to go back and try one of their other sandwiches sometime.

Thanks Egg Bae for the great introduction to your venue on Opening Day."}
{"text":"I'm a fiend for breakfast sandwiches. On the regular, my go-tos typically involve Timmie's farmer's sausage breakfast sandwich on a croissant, Bagel Stop's Supernova (lox and cream cheese), or McD's sausage McMuffin or McGriddle. These Eggslut-inspired sammies here are definite upgrades that would hit the spot for breakfast, brunch, post-hangover, or whenever really. I came to check them out during soft opening.
On my first visit, I had the Egg Bae's Bae-sic (fried egg, pork belly sausage, tomato jam, slow-cooked onions, Muenster cheese, Bae sauce) and Seaside Bae (soft scrambled eggs, house-cured citrus pepper salmon, potato chips, pickled shallots, arugula, herbed mayo).
I thought from the pictures, the buns might be a soft, light, and fluffy potato or egg loaf but no, they have a moist and dense crumb to it, giving these sandwiches a bit more heft (more so than your typical brioche--- very nice). These guys don't skimp at all. They're carefully constructed with ingredients made in-house (was surprised to hear they made their lox in-house).
For the Seaside, I recommend eating this crown side down because the amount of scrambled egg (perfectly fluffy by the way) and the thickness of the heel puts some distance between the tongue and the salmon. It's a very delicious and well put together sandwich.
Bae-sic: the melted cheese, the juicy pork belly sausage, and the tomato jam are wonderful together. Craveworthy and easily blows any sausage patty breakfast sandwich out of the water.
I came back again to try the other two sandwiches. I requested a hash brown inside the Eh Bae Bae and it worked really well (and easily defeats Timmie's farmers breakfast sandwich in any iteration).
Bae Don't Kale My Vibe was probably the biggest surprise and confirmed to me that no matter what accompaniments you decide on, it's still a solid sandwich. Common denominators? The in-house bread, perfectly executed eggs whether fried or scrambled, Bae sauce. Egg Bae could probably sell a bare-bones \"bae\" easily with just those ingredients assembled.
I'm glad to see you guys open a stone's throw away from where I work. It's more expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for. Without a doubt in my mind, to me, the best breakfast sandwiches in Toronto. Egg baes are the new \"hotcakes\", as in \"you better go early, they sell out like egg baes!\"."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much, but WOW these were sooo good!! We got bae-sic and seaside bae and they were both delicious. Made to order and tasted really fresh! Friendly staff as well, with some cute decor inside. The hash browns were tasty, a little too oily, but other than that would definitely order again!!"}
{"text":"This is a place you must try when in Toronto. Their hash browns are crispy and fluffy and their Eh BaeBae sandwich is a recommended choice!"}
{"text":"A great new addition to Kensington, we were lured in by the scent of their fresh daily baked in-house buns. We tried the bae-sic, seaside bae, and eh-bae-bae. The buns were sinfully buttery and the perfect vehicle for the velvety eggs and spicy sausage of my not-so-basic sandwich. The seaside bae was a litgher option and had house cured salmon topped with chips for a crunchy bite.

I look forward to scooping up these sandwiches for picnics in Kensington park this summer!"}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of their menu... and the sustainable use of locally sourced eggs and ingredients. Their egg bae sauce is delicious! Definitely going to come back again!!"}
{"text":"the newest breakfast sandwich shop in Toronto, very instagramable sandwiches. 
came to this location, for bunch a couple of Sunday's ago, during the semi soft open, when we arrived this place was packed with people and a line up, I was super excited to try this place out with all of the photos I saw online. I was pretty hungry at the time that we arrived so I decided to have three sandwiches, Bae-sic, Seaside Bae, Eh Bae-Bae. 
the Bae-sic was my least favorite, had I read that it was a fried egg I would not have ordered it, too many flavors at the same time just fighting with each other...yuck!, the seaside Bae was pretty decent, the chips in the middle were super annoying, but the salmon was seasoned beautifully. the eh Bae-Bae was by far my favorite sandwich they had to offer, absolute perfection in every single way, fresh and balanced. the highlights of this place is how well the eggs are seasoned, and the buns are absolutely addictive. the food came to us in about ten minutes, which was really a good time to wait in my opinion, especially with the flavors they produce. the hashbrowns were not an option at this time which was a bit disheartening to say the least , water was priced at 3 dollar a bottle which was a little bit overpriced and silly. the art on the wall is beautiful as it was done by a local artist called UBER5000. definitely worth coming out to experience, I really want to come back to try the hashbrowns and the lemonade they had in the fridge. the restaurant is very vibrant, colorful and the art is a super nice touch. the restaurant was pretty packed when we arrived, found a seat right away, and still packed when we ended up leaving. also they have outdoor seating as well (picnic bench)

parking is available on the street and in private lots throughout the neighborhood. 
transit options are the 505 Dundas, the 511 Bathurst, the 510 spadina and the 506 college all within walking distance. 

can't wait to come back 
BAE BAE!"}
