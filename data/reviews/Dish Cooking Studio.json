{"text":"An excellent absolutely exquisite experience at Dish in Toronto. When you walk in you are greeted with a name tag and an apron, oh and a glass of vino. When it's time for class you can find a seat either front row or second tier. It doesn't matter where you sit, because before long you'll be cooking. You are divided into small groups based on what course you choose to work on. Pay attention to the different courses and raise your hand for the one that you think you could learn the most doing. When you get to your station, you are given a recipe and guidance throughout. You do all the chopping, mixing, searing, and plating. You are encouraged to taste as you go to make sure you seasoned properly. You will learn some proper knife skills and tips for home. When everything is made, you sit down for the meal you created. They bring it to you plated in courses. 

The atmosphere at dish is as if you were a chef in a real restaurant kitchen. The experience is bucket list worthy and I definitely recommend for a date. we had lots of laughs! You are not made to feel dumb or amateur, the chefs are laid back and enjoyable to be around. I had an excellent time here and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great and fun experience. Went on Valentine's Day to cook \"Death By Chocolate.\"  The food was delicious. The experience was fun. 

Highly recommend it. I think it would be a great team outing as well. It is a little pricey but I think you get what you pay for. The food is high quality also."}
{"text":"Happen to walk by this space a few times on College Street while working in the area. Thought it would be worth my while to pop my head in and see what the studio was all about. 

Well, little did I know that they actually served food in the front half as a cafe. So this became a go-to spot for me. The food is all freshly prepared in-house using fresh produce and local meats. They sold everything from soups, salads, sandwiches, and a hot counter plus always had some kind of special of the day. 

I really loved their soup and salad offering. Typically the idea of a soup and salad doesn't sound to filling or appetizing but their portions and combinations were just incredible (and healthy too!)

Plus, the few times I peeked into the studio space it looked huge. While I never got to see an actual class taking place: I saw lots advertised. It looks like it could be so much fun.  10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing Quiche here! The crust is this perfectly puffed pastry and the bacon is divine. The Rise Kombucha they sell here is also the best I've had in Toronto."}
