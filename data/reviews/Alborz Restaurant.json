{"text":"We needed a late dinner after a long day and were in the Area. So glad we stopped in! I enjoyed some tasty olives marinated with pomegranate and walnut, and then some smoked eggplant with egg. My husband chose chicken cooked with saffron. This came wit delicate rice and a salad with the nicest dressing we've had in some time! Worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Just paid an insane amount of money for what is essentially rice and ground beef cooked on a skewer...didn't even include a salad for $13!! It was nicely seasoned, as I love, but could definately do way better. I'm gonna keep looking for a new middle eastern spot in this area...the food was good flavour wise but price wise just didnt do it for me."}
{"text":"This is my first time having Persian food and I'm SO glad someone brought me to her favourite Persian restaurant .  Alborz is a small , quiet restaurant across Food Basics on young.  I have no experience with having Persian food so I have nothing to compare it to ..but it was one of the best new things I ever tried !I had Their tenderion or whatever.. Which was very tasty and not too oily. I never had Persian styled rice and that was a bit dry but the saffron ( yellow spice ) on top of it gave it a very nice flavour and touch to it. It also came with a baked tomato, there's nothing significant about that.  I enjoyed having their tea with sugar cubes. Never knew the proper way of drinking tea until I visited !   The restaurant is quite small and I'm not sure if they bothered to even put the heater on but boy... Was I a bit cold when I stayed there.  It was probably due to a lot of people walking in and out ..  The interior is quite nice.. I was surprised because of the location it is in .. ( In a very old plaza ) There was only one waiter when I went and he was very friendly :).. but it was a bit difficult speaking to him because of his thick Persian accent   Overall I was satisfied with Alboraz, I will definitely come back when I get the chance"}
{"text":"Best Persian food in Ontario, Canada. My favorite is the Torsh kabob here. I've been coming here for the last 8 years and the food has remained so consistent. Brilliant food, service and newly renovated look is much better now."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple times and every time the food has been delicious! The kabob is amazing! The decor is very nice and the service is awesome. But every time i go there the restaurant seems empty (maybe I go too late..). I wish they has more business; they deserve it."}
{"text":"I love this place, if you are looking for good quality food this is the place. Service is a bit slow but the quality makes up for it. The owner is very friendly. Highly recommend this place and specially their \"Zereshkpolo\" ."}
{"text":"I have known about Alborz for many years now but it was my first visit. The fact that this place is usually so quiet despite its amazing location (on Yonge St.) was already a concern for me. In spite of its surroundings (old dirty plaza), It was much cleaner than I had expected it to be.   The menu was all in Farsi. I suspect that they bring out an English version for non-Iranian customers. Right off the the bat, I noticed their prices to be %10-20 higher than the competition. A simple plate of Barg (tenderloin) set me back $20 tax included. The tenderloin has tender but lacked taste. The rice was also on the dry side.   All and all, Alborz exceeded my expectations in regards to cleanliness and ambiance (really enjoyed the santoor music playing in the background) but the food quality did not match the price. I could have had the same dish at the more elegant Zaffron (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/zaffron-restaurant-north-york) for practically the same price."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try today finally as I always saw it across food basics. I ordered a chicken breast skewer plate which came with rice and grilled tomatoe. The chicken was juicy but the marinate could be more flavourful. There was also too much lemon juice drizzled on top of the meat which dominated the flavour. Now this was a negative thing for me as the meat got too sour. The grilled tomatoe and rice on the other hand were perfect.  The server was nice and our food came with warm pita bread, pickles, onions and peppers, which I enjoyed.  The bill for 2 people came out to a total of $40. I am giving this place 3 stars since there are equally good Iranian restaurants in the area for lesser price and more flavourful meat!"}
