{"text":"This is one location that won't see me again.  The air conditioning was down so low that it was an iceberg in the restaurant.  It blasted non stop.  I asked the runner if it could be turned up a bit.  She said 'yes,' then left and forgot all about my request.  There are no seats in this place that you can get away from the cold blast.  The only difference is do you want it blasting you in the front or the back.  I ordered a taco salad.  when it arrived, the plate was hot.  Within 5 minutes it was refrigerator cold.  It ruined my entire evening because I couldn't thaw out."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night. Our server didn't know the menu at all. My husband ordered the chicken tortilla soup and the server repeated it back to him and commented how she loves chicken tortilla soup too. When he got his soup the sever said she forgot to ask if he wanted chicken... He ended up saying it was ok and ate it anyway but then said it had carrots and squash in it with and got 2 large tortillas with it, for what I'm not sure. I had to repeat what I wanted several times then show her on the menu. The chicken fajita quesadilla was ok but very oily. The mollyrita was too small. Also the table next to us did nothing but complain about how bad their food was while we were waiting for ours so that didn't help either lol. The bus boys were immature too. Overall very disappointed. The other location was better in my husband's opinion, the soup was completely different, but even then I thought food want that great there either."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my moms 87 th birthday. They put us by the kitchen and bathroom. Asked waiter for a different table and he didn't accomadate us. We left. Fuck you Carlos Obrians."}
{"text":"We had excellent service during their busy lunch hour.  My shrimp enchiladas were very tasty and I would definitely go back. Highly recommended and when you go as for Brandi!  She goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"I would have thought that an established restaurant chain here in the valley would have worked out all of the pains of opening up a new location. Boy was I wrong! I recently had the opportunity of trying to dine at this location only to find the service two notches below mediocre. Our server doubled as a bartender hence the lack of attention to his tables. After ordering two dinner plates it took over 45 minutes to have our food delivered only to find our food had been sitting somewhere in the kitchen with no one taking any responsibility for which table to deliver it to. The food at this location does not meet up to the quality of the one on Northern and 12th Street. Your better off going to Taco Bell. I might try this place in about another year when maybe they get their act together and the company takes a look at the consistency of their food in comparison with their other location."}
{"text":"Overall just a worse second time than the first. Food was wrong, but right on my check which means just like all of the other reviews said the kitchen there is lackluster at most. Food was bland and tasteless asked to speak to manager since my plate was dirty and food took 50 minutes. Manager came to table and knew nothing at all same manager I spoke to before on my first visit he knew nothing of the food or what was happening. He gave me my food for free and walked away but there was no apology or genuine remorse. I didn't want anything for free just someone to understand what's happening, I asked my waitress if it's always like this and if he is always that disrespect her response was it's always chaotic and that he is \"useless\" and only there because of his family"}
{"text":"I am having a hard time giving this 1 star. My husband and I came at 2pm on a weekday and figured that the food & service would be just as good as Scottsdales location.. but that was not the case here. We waited 15 minutes at the bar before we were asked if we wanted anything to drink and twice as long waiting for the COLD food. There was more waiters than customers and they were all talking to eachother not seeming to care who was there. What a waste of money and time that was for us. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you want horrible service then this is the place for you. Sat there for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. Went to the front to ask who our server was and she acted clueless. Asked for a Manager and he/she never came. I have been going to the Northern location for over 20 years and never had this kind of experience."}
{"text":"I just want to thank the restaurant manager Ruben for being so accommodating for our group especially on Cinco De Mayo.  Considering how busy they were, they were able to get us in in no time which resulted in a successful surprise birthday dinner.  So thank you, Ruben.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited too see this in my neighborhood but what a disappointing experience. First of all, we go to the other locations and love it every time. 
Unfortunately it started out bad, we were sat by a window/door which was so hot! I couldn't wait to get back into my car for the AC. Our waiter was nice but not knowledgeable about the bar/drinks. He brought me the wrong drink but never came back so I could tell him but I was so hot I drank it! We asked for guacamole but he never brought it. The salsa and chips are usually my favorite but neither had any salt in it on on it. So there was no flavor and I'm not one that adds salt to anything but I did that day. And too no surprise my food had no flavor either! How can you mess up tacos?? I hope they work there kinks out but until then I'll drive any distance to get good food!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of of friends.  There was 11 of us total.  The staff was awesome!  Kept up on all our drinks and chip & salsa were always full.  Food was good and everyone got they ordered.  Wait time wasn't long and our waiter, Alex was great."}
{"text":"Eh. Not very good at all. Decent service but I'd never come back. Way too many really, really good Mexican restaurants around here go waste time at a mediocre one."}
{"text":"I love the Scottsdale location, so I can't understand why the Happy Valley location is not on the same level.  Service is horrible.  You sit there while staff are talking and dancing around, they walk right past you.  We asked for a menu 4 times, we ended up walking to the front and got it ourselves.  Food is cold and bland, nothing spectacular.  I've given this place several chances but I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"We were and still are so glad they opened this location! Everyone at the office was thrilled! We all used to go to the old one at Bell n Scottsdale then the bosses moved our office... We were all so bummed.  Now we are all happy again! Try the shredded beef fundido! Best damn dish!"}
{"text":"Sunday lunch...hostess and host, not greeted well, no Hi, welcome, follow me, just awkward.   Waitress was friendly, should have mentioned that a larger margarita was available.   My rolled taquitos were cold inside, she took them back to be placed in oven for 5 minutes,  barely warm even after that...we had mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary,  so she told management,  and that was taken off the bill, feel manager should of come to our table.  Second beer for husband was wrong.  She brought us a desert for free, which was nice, but I certainly wouldn't pay for it, shell on Ice cream was tough and chewy, dollops of whipped cream placed around had no flavor.  Chips and salsa were ok, never asked if we'd like more...  I know sounds like a lot of complaints,  but it was a celebration and money spent that was disappointing.
Over all just so so, I realize it's only been about a month since opening, but Carlos Obriens has been in the valley for years...some stepping up needs to happen"}
{"text":"Not the same as northern location food comes out slow waiters don't know the menu and the food had no flavor"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Carlos O'Brien's. The margaritas are strong, the spinach queso is delicious, and the steak street tacos are delicious. The shredded chicken is very bland, so stay away from that, but the other meats are tasty and seem to be good quality."}
{"text":"This place was truly exceptional. We called 10 minutes in advance and had a party of 22. They were able to seat us right away and were very accommodating. Everyone from the hostess to the waitress and food runners were very nice and efficient. Normally with a party of this size, food is missing or messed up but everything came out perfectly. Everyone got the correct order and it was brought out all at once instead of in 5 minutes increments. We were all VERY impressed and couldn't have asked for better service."}
{"text":"This was probably my least favorite place to visit... Del Taco has more flavor and better service. The food was mediocre, no seasonings and was placed very sloppy on the plate... my kids plates were unbelievably hot, my daughter burnt her finger a little... and i sat there with no water because my server kept forgetting to fill it up... needless to say, we will never be going back and have already told family/friends not to waste their money..."}
{"text":"So happy to have a familiar, local restaurant up in the north valley! Tacos. That's all."}
{"text":"Where to begin??? I was kind of excited when I saw they were changing the old TGIF's to a new place and was happy it was a Mexican restaurant....even though north Phoenix is chain restaurant heaven. It started out bad as we got out of the truck and the stench of sewer was over powering, I thought we could look past that. As we entered it looked about the same as the old place inside (looks like they just  took down all the stuff from the walls and just put up some free pictures from beer companies. We sat down and a very nice server named Sam came over to take our, we order soft drinks and we're informed that they were out of Dr Pepper, Coke and Sierra Mist....ok, I almost have to have a Coke when I'm eating Mexican food. So I'm informed Sam that I was going to Jacksons and buying some Cokes and bringing them back. I got into my truck to go get the drinks, and now my truck smelled so bad from the sewer that I had to drive over there with my windows down! On to the food.... a TV dinner would have been better! Most of the stuff is straight out of the can and taste like it, it's horrible at best. To bad because I always try and support businesses in my area. Oh well on to the next."}
{"text":"Saturday Aug 19 we went to Carlos O'Briens for a late lunch early dinner. The restaurant was packed so we thought this is a good sign the reviews on yelp were wrong. Well the reviews on yelp or right the food was mediocre but the service was good. I ordered fajitas they should've come out on a sizzling plate, the margarita I ordered seems a bit watered down. Would I go back no can I recommend this place definitely not"}
{"text":"Hey Hey hey Az it's Analynn bringing you my review of Carlos O'Brien's.
Service was fantastic, affordable prices, people really great but,sadly, the food is just mediocre . If you go let me know what you think. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Food is very bland although it looks good.   Cheese enchiladas are super greasy.   Even the taco salad is bland.  Salsa tastes like tomato sauce.   Very disappointed.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"This Carlos O'Brien's just replaced TGI Friday's in our Norterra complex. Because of the recent opening, it was very busy. Overall the food was your average Mexican food. The strawberry margarita on the happy hour was small, but cheap. 
The restaurant layout is the same as the previous TGIF. We had a nice server. The restaurant was very loud. If you're looking for a casual, cheap restaurant it's definitely appropriate."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, terrible service, and meh drinks. Hard to find parking but that is not the fault of the restaurant,  it is in a very busy area. 

Drinks:
Whole table got margaritas, and when the waiter went to set down my boyfriends drink, he spilled a bunch of it all over his side of the table and did not apologize nor acknowledge it, it was very odd thing to witness for the whole table. They use low quality tequila and serve the margaritas in small normal cups, not your typical margarita glass. If you want a good cheap margarita, I suggest Golden Margarita from Costco and just bring that with you if you get dragged here.

Food:
 Chips and salsa were okay, but the 'hotter' salsa just tasted like chili powder and water mixed together. It was the same thing with the beans. The beans were almost inedible with the amount of salt, chili powder and whatever else they put into them. How can you mess up classic refried beans !? Mexican rice was good, so was the Pollo Fundido and Fajitas Quesadilla, good guacomole and sauce. We also got the sampler plate and cheese crisp which were okay. There are many better hole in the wall mexican joints that you can go to in Arizona or really anything ending in \"berto's\".

Service:
The location is new, and most of the waiters are young kids, so it seems like there is still a learning curve for the waiters. As mentioned before, our waiter did not apologize nor help clean up for a spill he caused. He also forgot items that we ordered several times and we had to remind him. Also, at the end of the meal, a girl sets down a tray full of food next to our table and it was our exact order all over again, so they had put in our order twice! We said we didnt mind getting a second meal for free though. They seem to be pretty scattered but im sure theyll get it together."}
{"text":"I would say Taco Bell is a step up. It was the blandest chicken taco I've ever had.! It also was laid on my beans so it was really nice to hold. The fish sandwich was tough and hard to eat. They forgot the sauce on it and the salad dressing.  Nothing special for the price.  Oh, and they forgot to bring out the fried ice cream they promised for my moms 70th bday."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Maragritas are good. Salsa is good. Nothing strikes me particularly as something that I would send someone out and say \"you gotta try this.\".. had a chicken chili today.. chicken was bland. Tasted like boiled chicken with maybe a few green chilies thrown in. Just your average Mexican fare, I guess. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Just about the worst dining experience we had in a long time. There is no ambiance whatsoever.... Feels like a train station. Extremely noisy and just awful. The service was mediocre and the food was tasteless. NEVER again.... Money wasted for sure.... Not even the Margarita was good....."}
{"text":"This place opened up recently in my neighborhood. I was waiting for a ride, so I stopped by here.  I ate at the bar.  Chips and salsa that comes first was not bad. Good flavor.  I had the carne asada dish.  It was....not great. I think it was the quality of the meat.  Well, maybe I'll give it another try. Maybe."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location several times with my husband and friends and always had much better service and food than I did last night. We took an out of town friend there last night and I was  disappointed with the food, the service and the restaurant... They sat us on the west side of the restaurant and no one came to take a drink order for about 10 minutes... I asked the greeter who was seating another couple and finally a waitress came and took our food and drink order.   The waitress came back to tell us one of the fajita meals we ordered wasn't available that night... What? The waitress finally softened up and was actually very cordial and checked  us several times. The restaurant was very dirty... There were flies inside the restaurant... Dust on the ledges... broken and dusty blinds in the windows that didn't work. The glass window separating the bar from the dining area was very dirty as well... I was pretty disappointed overall"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch! Food was hot, fresh!
I love Mexican food, and grew up in the valley,
Everything was perfect!
I notice the reviews were negative, however, wanted to give it a try-we live in the neighborhood! So glad we did!
Ellen was our sever, she provided the best service!
We will be back to see her
Thank you Ellen!"}
{"text":"My food was boring and bland, bordering on flavorless, in my opinion. So disappointing. I think they forgot to order a spice rack."}
{"text":"Just not good Mexican food. Maybe they just need more practice since it's new we will cross our fingers and hope it gets better I'm going to wait a few months and try it one more time."}
{"text":"Food is as good as I remember it, portions are big and taste is very good.  Service was outstanding, our waitress was on top of it and kept on our drinks ant whatever else we needed.  Dessert portions were HUUUGE!  I will be coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"We visited this establishment on a Tuesday evening for dinner.  All of the staff was very pleasant and accommodating and our waiter was absolutely excellent!  All of the tables were filled with happy customers - clearly enjoying themselves.  The food, on the other hand, was mediocre at best.  Everything was delivered nice and hot and the drinks continued to flow, but when everything is either covered in \"red sauce\" or \"green sauce\" it makes you wonder.  We really wanted to find a good Mexican Food restaurant in the Norterra / Tramonto area.  One with delicious, authentic, fresh meals.  Unfortunately, this just wasn't for us.  It was obvious to us that we expected more from this restaurant than they could provide."}
{"text":"The manager Ruben is awesome they're really quick with chips and salsa and the 32 oz beer is 999 all good the manager is very good with all of the people"}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait forever for your order at lunch, stick to the \"lunch specials.\" Also, make sure the server reads back your order - I ordered the small bowl of Chile con Carne, and he brought me the full meal... And then charged me the full meal price even though I said that wasn't what I ordered when he brought it to the table. Also best to skip the spinach queso dip - it's watery and awful, and expect the white wine to be served at room temperature. Overall, the food and the service fell WAY short."}
{"text":"Had dinner their this past Saturday night. Honestly we were looking forward to it as we had fond memories of the original on Northern. Typically I consider most Mexican chain restaurants similar, most are decent, not great but it's Mexican food it's not that complicated. This was just not good food. The chips were tasteless, salsa was bland. My wife had the chicken fajitas that were so dry and tasteless they were almost not edible. I had the steak fajitas, the meat wasn't bad but the presentation and other items were just bland beyond edible. I was surprised that at 7:30 on a Saturday night there wasn't a line, In fact the restaurant was half empty. Well after dinner I realized why."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!! I was so excited for this place to open and I was so disappointed after eating the flavorless shredded beef. The Taco was bland the hot sauce was gross. I asked the waitress if this was owned by the same people with the same recipe that's how bad it was. I don't recommend this place at all. Back to Popos!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to CO'Bs for about 35 years. (Since their days at 16th St and Bethany Home). Went to the Happy Valley location tonight and were promptly seated in a booth. It was almost 8 pm on a Tuesday night and very slow. We were immediately served chips and salsa, but no water. Waited for about 10 minutes with no service or even a greeting. The waitress at the booth attached to ours went to that table 3 times and wouldn't make eye contact with me even though I tried to get her attention. Three men came in and sat at a table right next to us, many minutes after we were seated, and were immediately served and had their order taken with 2 minutes. When my adult son went to use the restroom, there were 3 young female employees on their cell phones. When he returned to the table we left. No one greeted us at our table or made any effort to serve us at all. Horrible. My last trip there ever."}
{"text":"Recently heard of this place opening so me and my friends thought we d give it a try. I honestly enjoyed it. I ordered the Pollo Fundido. It was a massive portion and was the jalapeno cheese was flavorful and tasty. Id recommend it if your a cheese lover. Also tried their strawberry fried ice cream and that was good as well. Sandra was our waiter. She did a great job taking care of us. She was funny and very nice. Overall me and my friends had a good experience. If your in the Happy Valley area and want some good mexican food, check this place out!"}
{"text":"In my 2 previous trips since opening (2 months ago)  I would have given 5 stars hands down without any complaints. 

I am not here to complain about temperature or how busy it is.

I came in at 4 pm on a Saturday, here are the details:  

Food was amazing as always!!!!
Drinks were great and reasonable as always!!!
Staff, well, the manager  needs to fire staff to wake the whole staff up on what customer service and presentation are!!!!!

I walked in, was not greeted by the 8 staff members standing at the hostess stand, repeat, not one of the 8 staff ( I counted twice) even said \"hi\" to me.


I found a seat at the bar, there was a mess of shredded cheese and lettuce on the bar and the floor next to me from previous customers that was not attended to even though 6 servers and 3 bartenders came within 2 feet of me and noticed this without doing anything about it. But hey who doesn't like eating next to a mess!?!? 

I ordered a beer, got the beer in good time but waited a good 10 min for chips/ salsa and had to ask for a menu, I noticed several other customers waiting excessively to get staff attention to get their tabs and leave while waiting myself. 

Food was amazing as it always is, I have no complaint against the food whatsoever, my issue is with staff only and I hope the owner/ manager sees this soon before the staff of teenagers and careless bartenders tank this business. 

I will be back but if I experience this terrible service again, the amazing food won't save it, and I will ask for management on the spot!

Good luck."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for lunch. It's nice their lunch menu is available on weekends too. Hubby's cheese enchilada was good and he added the rice and beans for $3. I like that they had several options that didn't come with rice and beans on the lunch menu since I don't usually eat them. My Mach Ava tacos were a disappointment. I asked if the tacos were hard or soft and was told they were soft. Apparently machaca tacos are the only ones with a hard shell . Plus this was the blandest machaca I've ever had. No flavor at all. Our server, Alex, was efficient and friendly. I guess I was expecting too much from an Irish Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to this location because I love the one on 12th and northern. However I hate to say that this location did not impress me one bit. We arrived at the time they open sat down service was good however when food was brought to us our food wasn't very good and the beans were over cooked/burned and the rice looked like it had been from the day before. I was excited to come but unfortunately don't think I will return to the location due to the poor quality of the food and lack of standards that I am used to seeing from Carlos O'Brien's."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly on the dining side, the hostess was rude and not friendly, no one had on name tags, and I didn't ask for names. We were seated at an oval table 1 up from the server stand where we could see all the goings on of the servers. OMG! There were things happening in there we DID NOT want to see.  1. A server Styling another server hair, then going into the kitchen and bringing out a tables food, setting it down.  I wanted to go over to her and ask if she had washed her hands before grabbing their plates!!! 2. A server coming into work walked into the server stand and grabbed another server rear end. That server turned and round and smiled and they flirted. I do NOT want to see BUTT grabbing when I am trying to eat!  3. More of the \"hair styling\" server with another server. 4. Lots of standing around and talking and not doing much as our glasses sat empty and our check waited to be paid. 5. The food was bland and lacked flavor. 6. Chips & Salsa were just ok nothing special at all. 7. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We had a very large party at 4 PM on a Friday and they told us there were two parties of 14 ahead of us and it would be a 1.5 hour wait, yet no one was to be seen or ever showed up. There was a table set up for 40 minutes and neither of these parties showed up. Finally we went up and asked for that table specifically since we had been seated for 40 minutes. They ended up giving it to us. Once we were seated the service was very good, attentive and on top of things. The food was similar to Macayo's. I have the Pollo fundido - very heavy, margaritas were good! The North valley is in such need of good Mexican food, so I think this place will stay busy regardless but they still have some work to do on their quality."}
{"text":"After frequenting the 12th location for years we were excited to see this location open. We will stick with the 12th at location. Our server was very nice and attentive but the food was disappointing. I had a bean burrito enchilada style (how can you mess that up?) and while it wasn't awful--it was just meh. Too much sauce, not very warm. My husband had a queso beef dish that was swimming in cheese. We love cheese but it was just overwhelming and greasy. Cheese crisp was soggy. Drive the extra few miles to their other location. 
My brother had gone a few days prior and said his food was good. He got the pollo fundido. The table next to us got a couple orders of that as well. It looked really good--I was jealous of their food. Maybe they are working out the kinks but I'm not willing to spend my hard earned money again to test it out."}
{"text":"If I could give none I would, despite the reviews I wanted to give this location a try....disappointing for sure!!! 

Restaurant was too cold that it made our food cold, service was beyond slow, waitress seemed overwhelmed or confused when asking her about drinks. The waitress comped my food bc I didn't like it and wouldn't eat it so that was a plus. 

The guy bussing all tables moved faster than any waiter or waitress in sight, when we finally had enough and asked the waitress for the check she replied with give me a few minutes. What?! For my check to pay....unbelievable."}
{"text":"5 stars for excellent service - thank you Austin L. 3 stars for food. Food was ok, beef nachos were a bit greasy and lacking in toppings. Al la cart Green corn tamale while very large in size was mediocre in taste - lot-o-corn."}
{"text":"We keep trying this location in hopes that they pull it together.

First attempt- Called ahead to have a table for 15. Host stated that they don't take reservations. Okay, whatever. It was a Wednesday or Thursday anyways, how busy could it be? All 15 of us show up and the place is completely full and on a wait. Why not tell us on the phone that you don't have room for 15 and it would be an \"x amount\" wait?! Waste of everyone's time.

Second visit- I asked for hot sauce with the chips and salsa, but was informed that they were out. A few minutes later, our waitress Sam (who was great btw!) says they just finished making some, and brought it out. A relief, because I wanted to leave if there was no hot sauce! I won't eat mexican food without it. It had a strange taste though. Like too much chili powder or something. Added some salt, lime, and a little bit of regular salsa and it was good. 

Third visit- Service wasn't great. My order got messed up and we had to ask for extra salsa and refills. I'm in the service industry too. I get being busy, but it's a no-brainer to keep these filled. Waiter never came back to check on our food. He was getting an attitude from the table next to ours for a messed up order too. Felt bad for the server. Sometimes you can't catch a break. Kitchen or server mistake, who knows. I hope for better training/steps of service so he can avoid this in the future. The hot sauce still had an overpowering chili powder flavor. 

I wish the servers would tell you when guac/ sour cream/sauce comes on certain things. The menu doesn't always say, and those things can't be picked off like a tomato. Maybe the staff can anticipate this when someone modifies their order to omit several things off the dish. 

The dining area is always busy and I took notice of rude clientele all around us! So strange. However, attitudes are contagious. 

One more thing, please bring Huss Scottsdale Blonde on tap! The Barrio is terrible and we will continue to travel to Scottsdale for better food, drink selection, service, and staff! (We miss you, Christian!)"}
{"text":"So sad! But I've known this place since the 80's. The salsa tastes like eating out of a can of tomatoes and the hot sauce has no flavor or heat. The serving size is about the norm, but what made this place great was the great taste of the food and the portion size! The beans taste burned, and the cheese enchilada was a little to be desired. Won't be going back! Too bad the kids didn't take after their dads! They should know better!"}
{"text":"Meh.  That's what my 10 year old would say about this place.  

Server didn't know the menu, which is semi-understandable since the location is new.  What is not understandable is the bland fajitas.  I had shrimp fajitas and my wife had veggie- both sucked. 

The atmosphere looks like a played out former Chili's with the odd sombrero tacked to the walls to make it \"Mexican\". 

This place sucked - but I gave it two stars instead of one because I was feeling philanthropic.

Update- I just read that this place was formerly a TGI Friday.   So calling it a former Chilis nailed it.  Mic . Drop.

Update 2.  I just had the shrimp fajitas at a nearby Chilis. Chilis has better fajitas than this place.  That's it.  Don't need to change my two star review.  Just verified I was right the first time."}
{"text":"Carlos O'Brien's serves Sonoran Style Mexican Food and a few Irish Inspired offerings to salute some Irish Heritage. This is a family friendly restaurant but they do offer a full bar that is walled in the center of the restaurant. They also offer a smoking patio. 

The restaurant has a left side dining room with tables and u shaped booths. The center of the restaurant is a walled in bar. The left side dining room is long and narrow and on one side are tables and the other side are booths. Canned Mexican Music fills the air...the same music I remember Chi-Chi's played...

Lets get to the food.

It seems whoever came up with the recipes has an allergy to seasoning food.

They start you off with complimentary chips and salsas. I don't know if they make their chips but ours were free of salt and tasted less tasty than from most bagged varieties. Our mild salsa was also free of salt and tasted weak. The spicy salsa was very strange and tasted fruity so I fear my salsa might have had some sort of collusion with someone's beverage.

I had the Chicken Taco Salad Fajita Style. I received a fried flour bowl filled with mostly iceberg lettuce and unripe raw tomatoes. On top was some caramelized white meat chicken. I also received American Style sour cream, shredded cheese and unseasoned guacamole.

Disappointing :(

 THIS WAS THE MOST UNINSPIRED SALAD I EVER HAD ANYWHERE! NOBODY put any thought into this salad as it was boring as heck. \"Fajita Style\" should be with bell peppers and onions like a fajita. All I got was boring chicken over boring tasteless salad. It could have been named Unseasoned Boring Grilled Chicken Salad in a Flour Bowl. 

It's a toss up between one star and two stars but I generously went with two stars because the chicken was ok and our server tried.

What I tried was under seasoned and uninspired food."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but it's a busy Friday night. I would never come back or recommend it to anybody for the food. They get 2 stars instead of 1 based on the good happy hour drinks. Tostada was soggy to the point of not even being able to pick it up. Rice and beans taste like they're day old and reheated. Salsa is bland, guacamole is bland. This is my first and likely last time visiting here. There are much better mexican options in the valley."}
{"text":"Love it here, Good food and Good Friendly Service. I have family that enjoys the food so much this is the first & last place they want to eat when they come to town. Chill place to go for a relaxing drink and conversation with someone. It is not too loud making it impossible to Wind down, Excellent place to relax, have a drink and bite to eat after working with people all day. As well as a good place to have dinner, and a drink to kick it up a notch. The atmosphere is adaptable to whichever night U are looking for."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would.
Food took forever, then when it did come out it was not even edible. Chimichanga was flavorless and burnt completely on the sides inside and out. The rice tasted literally like rice-a-roni.... the pollo fundido (recommended by hostess and server) was literally disgusting. A burnt, flavorless chimichanga with cream cheese piled on it with - here's the kicker - SLICED cheddar cheese on top that wasn't even melted.... with a frozen olive on it. 

GAG.
We just asked for the check and figured we would just , the server was pissed but the manager was really cool and we left....
Again worst experience ever - avoid this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour prior to going to illumination. Sat in the bar. Took 10+ mins to even get asked what drinks we wanted. Had to ask for water twice.  There were 12 people in the bar area. Not exactly a busy night. 4 ppl standing around doing nothing. Finally got chips and salsa but did not provide plates, silverware or napkins. When we finally got water the bartender pointed to the straws for me to help myself. Ordered a cheese crisp let's see if they remember. Not a great first impression, I will not be back. With all of the restaurant choices you'd think they would up their game."}
{"text":"Ugh,  what happened! Been to the Carlos on Northern many times and loved it. Not so much at this location. Food was almost unrecognizable, and  had zero flavor. Plus they got my order wrong. And the service was horrible! Waitress forgot about us twice,  had to wait ten minutes just to get utensils to eat with, didn't bring water to the table, and when we finally got the bill I noticed they charged us $30 for two entrees which is high considering they were basic entrees, nothing special or fancy."}
{"text":"Took my son here for my 40th bday, had a great time! bartender Heather was on top of everything,  loved the fajitas! the steak was fantastic!, only complaint was the guacamole needed more flavor. def will be going again!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond hideous. Probably the worst Mexican restaurant in AZ. I don't know how people eat here on a regular basis. The food is disgusting and the service is blah. Stay home and make a quesadilla, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch and love that can order online. Have been going to their other locations for over 20+ years. Great taste!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I was super excited that a new Mexican restaurant was opening up by us. The food was not very good, it didn't have much flavor. I will definitely not be going back. The server was very nice and the service was decent. But I did have to keep asking several times for things.

Who is deciding what restaurants open up in Norterra? You would think we would have gotten something a little bit more exciting here. Or at least a lot better. It looks like the reviews for this place everywhere else are about the same."}
{"text":"I heard that the place had a few hiccups when they first opened but I can say after eating there on August 4 2017 that they are well on track to be the great place that I have seen at the other locations. Samantha and jared gave us great service and I will come back in the near future."}
{"text":"I love the salsa and the food! 
I've seen some people say they don't like the salsa here because it isn't \"salty\" enough. In my opinion I would say these are the kinda people that think \"pace\" is a good salsa....not to mention I saw salt on every table.....
Grew up across the street from them(12th street and northern location) 
My go to meals are red chili burrito enchila style or El pollo Fundió! They just opened so the service is still in transition with so many people but I'm excited the north valley has some Mexican food places."}
{"text":"Honestly I was so happy that I found a Carlos O'Brien's near where I wanted to take my out of town guests to.  When we got there we had to wait a bit which was fine but then when they called \"my name\" someone else jumped up and stole our spot.  I was so taken back by that but that's okay God blessed us with a better spot to sit.  But to be fair shame on those people for being rude and the gal at the front desk for not making sure she was sitting the correct people.  So now lets get to the food.  The Carlos O'Brien's that I used to eat at was the one on east Northern.  Wonderful place and food was always amazing, this place not so much.  The food by the time we got it was cold, beans were so salty, the guacamole was disgusting, had no taste at all, the chips most of them were burnt and grease at the bottom of the bowl, my guest food, he said his was fine, she ate most of her salad, but mine seriously wasn't good.  I was so disappointed as I love this restaurant, used to be the main Mexican food place I'd go out of my way to.  The place itself was charming but the food was not so charming.  They need to really read the food comments and fix the issue because all in all this could be a great place.  I don't normally leave comments, good or bad but I just felt this needed to be said."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location since they opened. When the restaurant first opened service and food quality was excellent. Recently food quality and quantity on our to-go orders has been less than desirable. We seriously have gone there just about every weekend for  to go orders and have eaten there about 10 times. The managers do not make any effort to get to know repeat customers... good repeat customers such as ourselves. When we were there recently we simply asked for a few extra hot sauces to go with our chips in our to go order and the gentleman who is clearly one of the managers was very rude to us and he has helped us numerous times with our to-go orders. Needless to say we didn't feel very appreciated and couldn't believe that two little containers of hot salsa was that much of an inconvenience or expenditure for the restaurant where we spend nothing short of $50 a week.  Needless to say we're cutting back on frequenting this restaurant and if their overall attitude towards regular patrons doesn't improve we may just cut them out altogether and find another favorite Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Not sure what some of the issues in the other reviews were from. I was worried coming after reading the reviews but have never had a bad experience at the Carlos Obriens on northern. Everything was great, food was good, service was good, lunch specials were good. Definitely worth coming back"}
{"text":"I found myself in the Happy Valley complexes looking for something to eat before doing some shopping. I've never eaten at Carlos O'Brien's and quite honestly was curious about it. I have noticed at least five or six places in Phoenix that have the Mexican/Irish name blend to them, and honestly I have no clue why.
Seeking answers, I went in. The restaurant had specials for Irish beers and Mexican ones as well. The menu, however, lacked any irish fare, but did have lots of Mexican food. I ordered the steak Fajita, as it's my standard for most Mexican restaurants.

Service: I sat at the bar top for several minutes before one of the bartenders came over and asked if I would like something. I would be less perturbed about this, except that I was passed at least three times by staff and not acknowledged. Once I received my food, they were attentive enough, making sure my water was filled and that my beer wasn't empty. I don't recall them asking once \"How is it?\" though. Rarely do I answer anything other than 'Good' or 'Okay', but it is a great opportunity for your service staff to fix an issue right away.

Food: This is a restaurant in the kind of area that shares it's spot with PF Changs and Olive Garden, but also shares a parking lot with Wal-Mart. I felt I got more of the Wal-Mart quality than the PF Changs. The steak was salted and peppered, but nothing more than a light dusting. It was a bit flavorless. 
What irked me a bit is that the cold lettuce and tomato was served on the same piping hot plate that the beans were served on. To me, hot should go with hot, and lettuce should be served on a surface that won't wilt it.  

Would I return: If a bunch of co-workers wanted to go there for a few beverages and a group dinner, I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't recommend it over Carlos O'Kelly's or Abuelo's. Honestly I'd probably recommend PF Chang's or Mellow Mushroom since it is just across the street from the place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Their location is Scottsdale is much better, well worth the drive. I have been to this location twice about a month apart. This time We arrived at 6:15 got seated right away, did not get our food until around 8ish(what the heck right!?) then had to wait again for our checks until 8:40pm. Waitress was horrible (bad attitude), food was cold, late, didn't come out right, and over all did not even taste good. Not only this time but last time I came here aswell. Will not be here again anytime soon and will not be recommend this place to anyone. Definitely going back to the Scottsdale location due to wonderful staff and food. Sad this place didn't work out for it's only 5 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Awesome bartender. Dude was amazing! The fajitas were tasty!"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for Mexican food and honestly not very good.  I'm willing to cut a new restaurant some slack, but not so much for dirty bathrooms and blah food."}
{"text":"I went opening week and haven't been back. For an opening week, the restaurant was not very clean and not modernized at all (I should mention I never went there when it was TGI Friday's so don't know what it looked like before). Our food was mediocre and my sons food (quesadilla) was dripping with grease so much that it dripped onto his shorts ruining them.  Food from previous customers was still on the booth seats and floor.  Such a bummer because Carlos was a family favorite growing up and this area needs a good family Mexican spot."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now. I'm not quite sure where all these bad reviews came from. Maybe it was an off day for them. But, the two times we have been here have always been a great experience.
Our servers, on both occasions, were so friendly and nice. We always had refills. 
Our food came out in great time. My husband got the pollo fundido and I got the veggie fajitas. My husband loved his burrito. That thing was packed with meat. He only wished the jalapeño cream cheese was a little spicier. I have had the veggie fajitas on both occasions. I liked it both times. The only thing I would change is that this last time the veggies could have been cooked a little longer. They were still a little raw. 
Chips and salsa there are always amazing! We are so glad that there is a Carlos O'Briens on our side of town!"}
{"text":"This particular chain is NOT a standard Carlos O'Brien's. It's like a knock off one that is super nasty. The beans are canned. The food came out cold. The only thing that was original was the salsa. The other two locations are great, but this one is horrible. Our waitress was super nice and we didn't want to give her a hard time for something she had no control over, otherwise we would have complained etc. on site."}
{"text":"This is not the amazing COB of the old days... Clearly a lot has changed. The service is pretty rough. The restaurant isn't that busy so I'm not sure what the issue was. The food was just ok. My sister's dinner was incorrect, remade, yet still incorrect. We will pass on this location for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time ever. Was terrible. The service was awful. It took about 5 minutes to greet us once seated. When given our chips and salsa, it was literally chucked at us. The guy didn't say anything and kept walking. The salsa was bland. The chips were just normal chips, most likely from a bag. Nothing special. I ordered the fajitas ...the chicken was so dry I didn't eat it, the veggies were not cooked enough though. The beans with cheese had a really strange/gross taste. There was no cheese to put on them...wth? The only 2 decent items was the strawberry margarita and the steak for the fajitas...it had a good flavor and was tender, but was cut into super chuncks vs. strips. I was excited that a Mexican place was opening by us, but holy fuck was TGI Fridays better. I won't be back and discussing this with others, they agree and haven't commented. You need to make a ton of changes if you wanna last."}
{"text":"White ass Mexican restaurant. Don't go here if you want anything authentic. Nothing on the menu sounded appetizing (no pics of food on the menu either) so I just got a salmon with mango salsa which was good. Salsa was pretty pathetic, I would say it's tasteless but I actually had to stop eating it cuz it just left a bad after taste. 

If you like mediocre food, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the best Mexican food! We were so happy to have the second location close to home."}
{"text":"This was a quick last minute decision on our way home which sounded perfect because I've been craving Mexican food for a while now. That being said, I would have rather had Taco Bell...

We went for an early dinner and we're seated right away which was nice because I was starving. We got chips with  a mild salsa and a hot salsa. Nothing special but it good none the less.

I ordered the combo with a ground beef taco and a ground beef enchilada. First off, most of the meals only come with beans and you have to order the rice separately from the a la carte. I found this to be a bit annoying. Secondly, the food was not good. The meat had zero flavor and the taco shell for the taco was stale. Normally when I am as hungry as I was, I'll still eat it even if it's not spectacular but I didn't even want to finish the rest of my meal. 

We also ordered 2 grande margaritas which were on happy hour. They were ok but seeing as it was a grande, it simply came in a pint glass. 

I was really excited to try this place because it's so close to home but they really need to step it up if they want to stay in business. The fast food Mexican restaurants in the area far surpass them with flavor and you get rice and beans."}
{"text":"It's been 3 months since they opened, we ate there a few times right after their opening and had similar experiences to the negative comments, but having been a regular at their Scottsdale restaurant for years, we had big hopes that they would work out the kinks. After experiencing a great tasting lunch today with great service, and talking to a couple employees, one that's been with the family owned company for 3 decades, it's evident that they've worked out a lot of their kinks and they're living up to their great reputation as an exceptional family owned restaurant. I hope anyone who had a bad experience give them another try."}
{"text":"I am one for authenticity and Carlos Obrian's misses that by a long shot. They don't even give you the massive quantities of food that they used to. At least then the quantity made up for the quality. Would rather drive further for better food."}
{"text":"Our go-to for Mexican food...staff is nice, food is very tasty and consistent....Cadillac Margarita is top in the city!  Do wish it was a little cleaner....it's a busy place and it kind of shows by all the splish and splatters, could use a deep clean"}
{"text":"Is there any way we can get TGI Friday's back? This place was disappointing. The chips were flavorless. It seems to also be a trend to \"make & forget\" here as all parties at my table were served over cooked - 1 degree less than completely burnt beans. The rice was also dry... I'd go to many other places in the valley before I ever step foot in here again."}
{"text":"My family and I will never return. The salsa bubbled in our mouths (a indication that it is going bad). The queso tasted like if you smeared velvetta on the mens room floor and scraped it off and mixed with mayonnaise. The fish and chips my husband got was pathetic. It was leathery, chewey and devoid of actual fish. The tacos I got were just sad. How do make taco bell seem like fantastic mexican?!
Menus were filthy. The only good thing we got was a good waiter. You do not want to go here."}
{"text":"I am submitting this review after careful consideration 
I went to this location two days in a row and had a lovely experience 
The staff is first rate
The food however is not
My husband and I had a good cross section of the usual Mexican fare
The chips and salsa were plentiful but were not particularly fresh
The hot and the mild salsa followed suit
The staff was quick to refill waters and chip baskets 
The waitstaff were excellent and very helpful 
Spices were out of balance in every dish we tried with the exception of the fish taco which were made with breaded Cod
The refried beans tasted overwhelmingly of cumin and the Tosada shell was stale and inedible
My husband said the beef dishes were sub par
All in all we wasted a lot of food because we just couldn't get past the flavors

As we looked around we noticed tables full of happy diners and clean plates
We deduced that the problem was us
Yes, we prefer quality over quantity and we do not settle for mediocrity 
With that said you should give it a try 
This is a lovely place
It's clean and staff is great
Great for the easily amused
Snobs and food critics should take a pass"}
{"text":"This place is a bummer. The name suggested potential (maybe there's somehow an Irish pizzazz to this Mexican food), but no. Just no. 

You can get this same bland Mexican food at 250 different restaurants in the PHX area. In my experience, there was nothing great, nothing to differentiate. 

Please note that there is nothing necessarily \"terrible\" about this place, everything is \"just OK\" from what I experience, but it's the \"Just OKness\" that's the big bummer. Mundane. Old white people I've talked to seem to love this place. Anyone under 50, no. 

I have no beef with the service or prices, but it's annoying to have to do 500 loops around the shared parking lot, finally get a spot, and eat food that feels soulless."}
{"text":"We were excited to have Carlos O'Briens close to home.  Sadly the food was not good. Salsa was bla, Cheese enchilada has no onions in it.  Green chili beef tasted like pot roast with 1 inch long pieces of green onions in it..Couldn't find any green chilis.. Ask for Rum n Coke...nope, they only gave Pepsi.  Staff was nice. Was TGI Friday before this, now plain walls...did see a little Sombrero hanging up.  Too bad.  Location is a gold mine but we still have taste buds."}
{"text":"Service was beyond slow.
'On the rocks' margaritas not too bad.
'Frozen' margaritas lacking any tequila and were tasteless, as was the salsa. 
Fish tacos and Macho tacos a B+.
Kids chicken tenders = tasteless according to my son (13 yrs old).
Won't be returning..... so disappointing."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Reminds me of a retirement home no flavor, no fun.  The ambiance is nonexistent. The chips, stale. Salsa, bland. We ordered veggie fajitas. So hard to mess up but they found a way. Who puts potatoes in fajitas and zero seasoning. I mean not even salt. No lime, no cilantro, nothing. Horrible and not up to par with other Carlos obrians"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with our restaurant choice tonight. It's the new place in town so we thought we would give it a shot. I was so disgusted by the food that I wanted to walk out. I ordered the #13 which included a green tamale, 2 mini chimis, mini bean tostada, 2 mini taquitos and beans.  The tamale was so soft that it fell apart and was inedible. The beans were crusty and old. The waitress never asked once how the food was. She noticed half my food on my plate and didn't even bother asking if everything was ok. My husbands food was equally as bad so we both left hungry. The chips and salsa taste like something you buy from the store. My fault for cheating on Manuels! Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican place I've been to. My family went here last night and was severely disappointed. We had party of 8. 2 adults and 6 kids. The chips and salsa were ok. My husband and I had the margaritas which were extremely watered down. I would have gotten a better flavor out a wine cooler. Giving the benefit I also tried the mojito but it was not any better. We ordered a lot of food and EVERY plate was BAD. The chicken was dry in big chunks. Making it difficult to eat on nachos or in the chimichanga. The beef was so greasy it made me sick. When asked how everything was, mentioned the chicken dry and our server offered more sauce. The kids plates were ok with cheese burgers and fries but expensive $7.50 without drink included. Received the bill and 18% Already added. Are party consist of mainly all kids. How was that worth 18%. I think not. Worst $175 dollars I've spent. Would have been better food, cheaper and experience if we went to Taco Bell. WOW this place is not even on Taco Bell's level. Will never go here again. DON'T WASTE YOUR $."}
{"text":"Horrible food! I would have rather gone to taco bell. I got the carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos had clintro which is fine but there  was basically a clintro salad on my small tortilla. The meat was tough and over salted  the rice was  gross as well. The  beans were obviously microwaved and had cold spots. My sons burger was hard. Never going back  i advise  you to go some where else"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to another place that offers gluten free options and I was very disappointed. Food quality is horrible! Had the guacamole which was sub par, followed by the spinach enchiladas which came out with cold spinach inside which was watery and clearly frozen prior. My boyfriend had a shredded beef burrito which was dry with very little flavor. Service was fine, I sent back my enchiladas and decided to replace with a flauta which came out DRIPPING with oil. We ate it because we were hungry but I would not recommend nor will we be back. Not authentic at all. Better off going to filibertos for half the price. This was our first visit and I'm sorry to say it was our last."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and stopped here for dinner on our way back to our hotel. The food is typical in terms of quality that you can expect from chain restaurants. The food was good, but not exceptional. The staff were friendly. The prices average for this type of restaurant. Generous amount of food.

I had the steak fajita quesadilla. It was more than I could finish. I liked that is was served with guacamole, sour cream and pick de gallo. The chips were served with two kinds of salsa. My youngest son really enjoyed his cheese enchilada and beef taco. He particularly liked the beans.

My husband had a beef enchilada and chicken taco. He's the only one who ate everything on his plate. He liked his dinner.

My older son had the carnitas dinner. Very generous amount of food. Couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"This place was miserable, and I really wanted to like it.  Went opening weekend.  Got a burrito and my wife got some tacos. The quality of what came out was on par with what I used to make with my microwave in college. No joke. Either these guys REALLY need to step their game, or you should flatly avoid them, plain and simple."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for dinner, had by far the worse service i have ever had. First 2 of the waitress were arguing over whos table it was.  Food arrived and the pollo fundito tasted like it was stuffed with week old boiled chicken. After abiut 20 minutes the waitress asked how everything was, i let her know my food was less then satisfactory and didnt want anything else, im the most condescending tone possible she asked \"well what would you like me to do then\" after telling her to take it off she just walked away angrily.  After my wife had finished eating we sat and waited for the check, after waiting 20 minutes i walked to the door greeter and asked for the check.  She went and got the server who dropped it on the front counter and said \"there you go\"  at that point i asked for the manager, and after waiting another 10 minutes i just left. Will not ever be back"}
{"text":"Good food the service is better at the bar . Nice employees!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good this place is. They have a good happy hour special. Margaritas were great. I'm a picky eater who is also vegetarian. I usually give up on attempting eating at any Mexican restaurants. I had the blue corn tamales and they were awesome! My husband has chicken and steak street tacos which he loved. We were very impressed."}
{"text":"We arrived just as they opened for a day date. Promptly sat by the friendly staff. Our food was out very quickly! And it was great. I love their jalapeño cream cheese. We have ordered takeout/catering too, and everyone loved it! Definitely will be going again."}
{"text":"I had only eaten at the location on 12th street and Northern. When this one opened up much closer to home we were pretty happy. But since our last two visits just didn't seem to live up to the other location, I'm just not motivated to return for the just ok food. Chips and salsa are still on point!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday dinner last night and the food was horrible!! My husbands food came out cold. The rice has absolutely zero flavor was burnt and looked really old. My daughter ordered a cheeseburger and it was better than the mexican food!!! We love the northern location and was really excited to have one close to home. Even though the sever was very good and attentive and the manager took care of our bill we will not be eating here again! Extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"Laura was our server and she was awesome, personable and attentive! Her helpers delivered chips and salsa and were on point! Food was great and the ambience was good. For a new restaurant, I was impressed!

{"text":"Not sure why the low reviews. This new location is as good as the original on northern. Food is fresh, drinks are tasty, and salsa is also great!!! Definitely a must go!!! Pollo Fundito is to die for but I always love the number 1!!!"}
{"text":"This place is close & was excited to try. Spent almost $40 for spinach dip, Chimi & 1 kids meal. The food was horrible, bland & I didn't even eat half of it. So disappointed.  Service was great."}
{"text":"you will never find mexican food this damn delicious.....its ALWAYS the very same and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Pretty much just your average white bread chain Mexican restaurant. Food was perfectly fine, but nothing special."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was so awful. The chips were stale despite being very busy. The food and margaritas were very bland and pretty awful tasting."}
{"text":"This is a new business opening of a chain. I know they are having growing pains and I am willing to give them time to tweak their operation.
I came in for lunch on a busy Saturday. Sat at the bar as there was a wait for tables. Was promptly greeted by bartender and drink came fast as very tasty. Was given chips and salsa. The chips were thin and warm, however, the salsa lacked seasoning. I ordered the beef flauta  that came with rice and beans. The portions were large, rice was good, flauta also lacked seasoning, but, was tender and plentiful. The retried beans were incredibly salty.
I also am not a fan on any bar seating that does not have a back on the chair. To sit with my back unsupported was uncomfortable and always leads to me not staying longer than I normally would have. I hope they rethink their bar stools which would make customers stay for that second or third drink.
I will give them some time and hope they fix the few problems with the lack of seasoning."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places, when we are up in north Phoenix.  I am a big fan of the Pollo Fundido, and my husband likes the Burrito Grande, with chicken.
They keep the chips and salsa coming, and we have had good service.  Our last waitress was named Brandy/Brandie, and she did an exceptional job!!"}
{"text":"We recently used the catering services for a birthday party. The food was fantastic!! Everything was prepared on time and they provided us with everything we needed!!

I would highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"The staff and food was really good. There were six of us and three of our orders were a little mixed up but not too bad. Our server was excellent. Unfortunately my younger son had a very small thin and sharp chicken bone in his chicken chimichanga which I found very alarming. Even more alarming was I was told that this wasn't the first time this happened. I really like the food but I can't take the chance on my kids choking."}
{"text":"In a town and state that takes pride in our shared Mexican heritage food is very important with that said this is by far the WORST Mexican food I have ever had. the stake was cold on the inside. Absolutely no flavor, watery comes to mind. Beans had a HARD CRUST on the top and the rice  was flavorful if eating tomato salt is considered flavor\"which I do not\". As I walking out I told my server I had to step outside to smoke to get the taste out of my mouth \"I don't smoke\". The chips were good."}
{"text":"The food is not very good tortilla chips were soggy and the main dish was just a sloppy mess. The restaurant just opened and it looks like they need to remodel this time could you please make it look like your in a Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Our family was anxious to try out this place for the first time.  We came in Saturday, 3/24/18, around 3 o'clock.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Our waitress was very nice and had another lady working with her.  Our real  complaint was the food, it was just not very good.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.  It was was too thin and runny, like watery soup and probably the worst tasting one I've ever ordered.  We did not finish it, and I am one that never likes food to go to waste.  I ate some streets tacos that were pretty good.  My son had chicken nuggets, which he said were good, but complained about how bad the rice and beans tasted, and he usually loves rice and beans.  My wife got the enchilada lunch special and did not like it at all.  My daughter ordered a shredded beef chimichanga, it actually looked like ground beef.  Needless to say, she didn't like it either.  We all agreed we will not be coming back.   Great service,  not so great food."}
{"text":"Our service and food was great. Laura was our server and we received 5 star service from her. The food was tasty, priced right and look forward to coming back. We love going to the Scottsdale location and are now happy to have a Carlos O'Brians closer to home. Of course a location closer to Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant Pkwy would be even better!!!"}
{"text":"Opening week for this location, and they're working some of the kinks out. Sam was great, the food and drinks were excellent. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"What a complete waste of time do your self a favor do not eat here. The service was super slow. Actually a tortoise was much faster. The food comes  out either cold or dry  depending on what you order."}
{"text":"I cannot understand the many one star reviews!! Perhaps it is the employees from the competing restaurants trying to bring this newer place down so that people go to their restaurant instead!! Note that most one star reviews are from when they first opened and the ratings have increased significantly since January (click \"details\" to review the major improvement in higher star reviews since January)!! So perhaps they deserved some of the one star reviews early on, but not based on our experience today!!

We really enjoyed lunch today!! I really appreciate that they offer lunch specials on the weekend, as many others do not!! Our server, Anna, was OUTSTANDING!!! She alone made this experience a five star experience!! She was attentive, she quickly responded to our MANY requests with a SMILE and she OFFERED UP extras like a cup to go for our drinks and a bag for our left overs!! 

I got a machaca taco, cheese enchilada and rice and beans. I enjoyed all of my food very much!! The taco had a huge amount of meat in it and excellent flavor!! My friend got the 2 shredded beef taco plate. She ate all of it (they serve large portions!!) and she stated that she enjoyed her food and that she wants to \"do this again!\" The kid got the chicken strips. Those chicken strips were very good!! So good that my kid wanted me to taste them (he offered up a VERY small bite) \"because they are so good!\" He got a large portion (unlike other restaurants) and he ate ALL of them!! The french fries are off the hook good!! Possibly the best french fries I have ever eaten!! Not sure how they nailed the french fries in a Mexican restaurant??  Chips are thin and crispy and have the perfect amount of salt (unless you are a salt freak...if so, add some salt). They deliver a milder \"hot\" sauce and a \"hot\" sauce as standard. I find mixing them together to be a perfect combo!!! 

I think they could decorate the place a bit better to add more ambience. I am used to the location on Northern from long ago which is quite elaborate and unique. 

We will definitely return!! The kid will insist on coming back here for sure!! He has just added it to his \"favorites list.\" Give this place a five star review on Yelp if you enjoy it as much as we did!!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch here today! Reading the reviews.. we almost went somewhere else but we decided to give it a try since it's close to our house.. so glad we did! 4$ margaritas  and they were perfect!  Food was hot, fresh and flavorful! We will definitely return soon!"}

The tall and short of it...I went for lunch with my gf. I ordered a chicken taco salad-the edible bowl was probably made a minimum of least 3 days ago...totally inedible...stale and disgusting. The contents inside were inedible. My gf ordered 2 beef tacos and they were dripping in grease and not in a good way-also inedible. 
The waiter was nice but I will NEVER go back nor will my friends or family. 
I now understand the horrifying reviews. Never have I tasted  more \"odd\" tasting-poor quality food in a restaurant. Terribly disappointing as we both live around the corner from here. Please don't be tempted if you live nearby-go to cafe rio or Taco Bell!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service, good atmosphere, great food, super price.  Had the Papa Fagita was surprised how large the plate was.  Excellent for a quick dinner with a friend."}
{"text":"Very poor service! This is my fourth visit here and  every tome it is the same. At first I thought the 4 service was just due to them being new and opening but this is my fourth visit here and a service continues to be the same. Is there a manager that actually supervises over the employees the service is terrible"}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix and the Carlos O'Briens at 12 Street and Northern was our family's favorite place to go for a family dinner. I live in another state now but when I visit Phoenix I love to fill up on as much Mexican food as I can!  This was my first visit to the Norterra location, it was big, bright and beautifully decorated. I ordered two shredded beef tacos just like I used to and they taste exactly like I remember they did. You just don't appreciate what you've got until you don't have it anymore, and Carlos O'Briens is definitely missed by me. Our waitress was so kind and fun, my parents and I had a fantastic lunch."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food... my shredded beef taco was cold and  had NO flavor ... so bland and I could actually taste the grease in it mostly.  My cheese enchilada tasted like someone dumped some table salt on it.  The chips had no salt on them at all and tasted like cardboard... the salsa had hardly any flavor and bland.  We will not be coming back to this restaurant... HUGE disappointment !!!!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing visit. Went for dinner last night and got seated right away.  The server was nice; however; we had to ask for things several times including silverware and sugar. 
Chips and salsa were ok; nothing special.   Ordered sangrias which tasted like wine over ice- no fruit- basically watered down wine. 
I ordered the steak fajitas which weren't good at all.   Meat had no taste- in fact I thought it was just microwaved meat.  The onions and peppers were chunks (instead of slices) and end pieces.   My rice and beans looked and tasted as if the plate was under the heater too long as you could clearly see it was dried  up.  The lettuce (brown edges) and tomatoes were not fresh at all. The guacamole and sour cream were served on top of each other as I had to go under the sour cream to see where the guacamole was. 
The server brought the bill without asking if we wanted any dessert.  I figured I needed to walk away with something good from this meal so we ordered the sopapillas.   Again- disappointment as soon as I saw the plate.  It looked like brown dinner rolls on a plate with cinnamon placed on the edges.  I felt like these too were microwaved.  
Overall I have no plans or interest to go back to this place.  
The only good thing out of my dinner was the company I was with."}
{"text":"I ordered two extra large trays for my party on the 13th to pick up the following day. Everything was ready at the scheduled pick-up time, the quality of the service superb, - three people helped me our to my car w the trays of mini chimis, etc. This came w chips and salsa, lots of salsa, quacamole,etc. Will do this again!"}
{"text":"A friend wanted to grab a quick lunch here. They offer wide range of Mexican cuisine. I opted for my usual chicken enchiladas lunch and my friend tried their tostadas. Her tostadas had lots and lots of cheese (as you can tell from the pictures) and tons on guacamole underneath. It was fresh but she wasn't happy with the proportions of toppings. My enchiladas were full of cheese as well; but it was only on one side of the plate so I was able to avoid most of it. The beans and rice tasted ok but it was big mushy mess. They give you giant portions, which I appreciated but I'd appreciate quality over quantity any day. 
Our waitress was awesome and provided great service although it looked like they had many big office parties going on at the time."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My food was covered in so much cheese I couldn't even find the tamale on my plate. Service was not so great either. Will not be going back. Sad because there is not a Mexican restaurant that close."}
{"text":"We live in the area and we're glad a Mex rest opened up around here finally. After 3 tries, we're ready to throw in the towel and go back to where we used to go, Don Rubens or Manuel's. The place is not exactly top-notch and a few rungs down. The lady was the first to notice even the chips were better elsewhere. Love the location, but now it's a hard sell to get her to return here. Phooey."}
{"text":"I would go for the happy hour (drink) prices and the chips and salsa but that's about it. The happy food prices are still high. The spinach con queso dip is really syrupy. It also tastes like it came from a can. Watch the plates, they don't clean them well. Even the tables around us had to request new plates because they were dirty. The quesadillas was okay but not work $8.50 happy hour cost. Watch what they charge you also, they overcharge instead of putting the happy hour prices. All and all, it was okay but I don't think I would return."}
