{"text":"Food is ok,not bad. They could've have more oxtail and coleslaw with the meal, a little light on the oxtail"}
{"text":"Large Jerk Chicken with rice and peas $11 - comes with coleslaw and plantain. I think the sliced, caramelized plantain stole the show. It had a great texture and had a slight sweetness to it. The coleslaw and fresh and not too heavily dressed but also had a slight sweetness to the dressing. The jerk chicken itself was in good portions but slightly dry in some parts and really salty. I still prefer getting my jerk chicken from Sunrise.  What I like about this place though is that they have small, regular and large options which Sunrise does not have. Service was efficient and friendly. There are a few tables available for dinning in but I think this place mostly deals with take out. Parking is limited."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. I've tried jerk from several different places including the popular restaurants downtown and none can compare to the flavour and experience here.   I don't usually review a place but since this place is new and close to my area, I would love to see it stick around. Please try to escovich fish and the jerk chicken. I'm a happy customer."}
