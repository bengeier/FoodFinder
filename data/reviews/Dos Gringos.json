{"text":"The service was horrible.  I would not come back if my life depended on it. The drinks stinked. The bartenders were all standing around visiting ignoring customers."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the atmosphere was a bar/happy hour atmosphere.  I'm just glad we didn't bring our son because it wasn't really an environment for kids.  It was also lacking in cleanliness."}
{"text":"A party of about 20 of us went to the Dos Gringos location in Old Town Scottsdale on Friday evening for a happy hour. Our server Fernanda was fantastic, as was the manager, Patrick. Both were very friendly, attentive and accommodating for our larger party. We ordered a mix of appetizers, which were all wonderful, and various items off the menu for dinner. I ordered carne and shrimp tacos, which were perfect but did see a few of their supergooey...whatevers and those looked amazing! Must try on my next visit. There were several other parties of various sizes filling up both the back and front patios, as it was a perfect afternoon to be outdoors. Thank you, Dos Gringos!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of my friend's friend.  The moment I entered this place, I noticed this was unique for me because everything is all outdoor.  As a person from the San Francisco Bay Area, we don't have places like this because of the weather.  There were heated lights, but I believe that's unnecessary especially with the warm Arizona nights approaching.   Maybe for the Winter season.   The food was very good.  We started with chips and salsa and their nachos.  The salsa was full of flavor and they taste a lot better than Salty Senorita.  My wife and I ordered the the six pack Dos XX fish tacos and they were very good, which you can't go wrong because its just beer battered fish.  They definitely taste a lot better than Rubios that's for sure.      They have live music Friday night and a huge Jenga block for anyone who wants to play.    The waitstaff was friendly and they checked back at us here and there.  This place is definitely leaning towards a younger crowd, but it's a fun place to be.  Dos Gringos is a nice place for lunch and is great if you have a large group for dinner and drinks.  However, I do not recommend this place if you have young children because some of the signage that is posted on the wall and below the bar counters.  Some of the signage is inappropriate for young kids to read.   The prices are moderate, which is usually just right for Tex-Mex.  Furthermore, the drinks are inexpensive and you can play Jenga.  If you're in Scottsdale, then I recommend this place especially you have a group of friends with you.   You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good after we finally got waited on by a waiter from another part of the restaurant.  He recognized we looked a bit exasperated at the wait and came over to rescue us!  Bravo to this waiter who took the initiative; wish we had gotten his name.  The best part of our meal was the ice-cold Corona's with lime!  The atmosphere is absolutely great; almost feels like you've stepped into old Mexico!  We'll be coming back to see if there is some improvements."}
{"text":"We used to live close to DOS & went here quite often. Staff is very friendly, love the food, & great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok so the atmosphere was good the service was good but the pollo fundido is probably the reason i will go back..That thing for 11 bucks...ya sign me up for 2."}
{"text":"Deep fried tacos!!!!!!! Oh my god!!! To die for... Second time in, last time was six years ago. And it was great then to! I wish I lived closer so I could eat here more often!!!!! Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time, it's my first time back in a year, the bartenders have NO personality and rude, they just want their tip and ignore the customers, I will give it another year before I go back. It's sad they hired these pricks,"}
{"text":"It is what it is... a white trash bar in Mesa with plenty of guys in their late 30s trying to fight and mack on chicks like they're juniors at ASU.  It is pretty pathetic, but not a whole lot of other choices in Mesa.    If you feel like getting drunk just to deal with the douche baggery of the scene and having to cab it back then it is the place for you.  Not much in the way of other bars in the vicinity, so once you've started drinking, you're pretty much stuck.    Last time I was at this bar some drunk guy in a suite started a fight with my table for reasons only known to him.    Some decent looking girls at this bar, but always surrounded by herd sleazy bar guy groupies.  Mostly the $30k millionaire types.  I would suggest this place to any guy over 35 who spikes his hair with Wal-Mart brand gel, drives a '98 BMW (bc he defaulted on his '10 lease and had his ride repo'd) and is an avid Jersey Shore fan.... oh, and who's favorite song ever is \"Booty Down on Me\"."}
{"text":"Use to love this place however my most recent experiences here will keep me until some major changes happen. Services sucks, food quality has declined, and bartenders take advantage of people they think are drunk (which I've seen happen to other people, and most recently to myself). With the amount of competition in the area, this bar is not worth the time."}
{"text":"Don't go to eat only! it's not a great restaurant, food is ok, server was cold and dismissive , tables and chairs are beat up and uncomfortable, salsa is out of a can. But it is a great place to go chill and drink with friends. I had a margarita and it was good. I would come back with friends to pre game or have a night out but not for a family dinner or anything like that."}
{"text":"Used to come here when I lived in AZ.  Always had a good time, and the service was great.  I've only ate the gringo rolls, and the tacos.  They're both great after a couple drinks.  I will definitely come back to this place if i'm ever back in the valley."}
{"text":"Came here for the Oregon Ducks block party. Nothing special about the food with the exception of the appetizer dips.  I tried the pork Chile Verde cheese dip  and it had a lot of flavor but got mushy since it was mixed with cheese and sour cream.  Good place for drinks but could do without the food."}
{"text":"Felt disrespected by the staff as soon as I sat down. The rude girls that worked there, Christina and Merlin, ignored you and wouldn't approach you unless you were a male. They wouldn't even give you eye contact. Will never return. My beauty might have been a little intimidating ;) I tried to not even rate but I had to at least check one box."}
{"text":"While the food wasn't bad...but not real good either, their drinks were VERY weak, probably because it was happy hour. My friend and I had 2-3 margaritas each, a shot each, and a beer each and never felt buzzed or anything. I'm guessing they give you about half the regular alcohol during happy hour. Tasted like we were just drinking Margarita mix and fruit punch."}
{"text":"As a first time Yelper, I thought it was my duty to pick out the most memorable experience from my recent jaunt to the Scottsdale bars to house my post.  I am not what you would call a bar fly.  I am more of a stay at home, curled up with a book kind of gal. The whole \"Scottsdale Scene\" leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  On this particular Friday night I was torn from the solace of my couch by a group of friends for a night on the town.  We began our evening in the Northeast part of Old Town amongst the neon lights of the newly constructed string of bars.  Giddy with anticipation of what our night would bring, we strolled into HIFI.  Being a stranger to the nightlife I was disappointed to find the service rude.  The bartenders seemed almost put out that I had the audacity to order a cocktail.  Let alone, the ever complicated vodka soda with a lemon.  I was assured by the rest of my group that was par for the course and I should be thankful the bartender chose to bestow her attention on me instead of the bar-back she was previously talking to. Far be it from me to rock the boat I smiled, thanked her, apologized to the bar-back and drank my $10 drink in silence, eyes cast to the floor.  Rinse and repeat for the next 2 hours on that side of town.  Some places better than others, though all having an air of superiority I didn't quite understand.    Fast forward to midnight, tired of battling aggressive V necks, we made our way across Scottsdale road.  The bright neon lights from the eastside of the street had nothing on the sparkling Christmas lights of Craftsman Court.  Making our way into Dos Gringos we were greeted at the door by a bearded gent with a friendly, \"Hello.\"   This is one of the larger bars I have been to in Scottsdale.  There were 3 different bars operating downstairs and one upstairs, which was not open on this particular night.  The place was crowded, yet we were promptly served with a smile as soon as we stepped up to the bar.  The tall red headed fellow handled my intricate concoction of vodka and soda water with ease.  We made our way to the back of the bar. The atmosphere was very inviting. The rhythm was right, I had my dancin' shoes on and me and your girl was booty shakin'.  There was more room in the back so our group posted up here for the rest of the night.  The music was excellent and all of the patrons seemed to be having a fantastic time, ourselves included.  All the bartenders, guys and gals alike, made us feel welcome and seemed happy to have us there. We were never without a beverage, and I never felt I was putting anyone out to have my glass refilled.  Fueled with laughs, the warmth of friendship, and something called Fireball, the sobering task of closing my tab crept up on me in the night.  I reached for the black check presenter with fear in my heart.  Already taking mental stock of my unpaid bills for the month, I opened the small book at the same time deciding Southwest Gas would have to wait for their money yet another paycheck. I was pleasantly surprised at the affordability of the libations.  My cat Gary and I would stay warm in spite of my poor decision making skills.  I paid my bill, left a generous tip, one that I thought was well deserved and was a direct reflection on the service I had received, and staggered my way into a taxi in the back ally.    I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a pretentious-free night out on the town.  Thank you Dos Gringos and staff for making one the few nights that I get out a great one!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"These gringos sure know how to make Mexican food"}
{"text":"This weekend is a celebration for my 30th birthday. Went to Dos Gringos because I remember having a great time at the Tempe location last time I was in town. It was awful. No service for the first 10 mins we were there. After that, was served 2 bottled beers and (delicious) tacos. Waitress never came back. Waited 20 mins, flagged our waitress down, who was clearly preoccupied with chatting with coworkers, closed our tab. Never to return and will never recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to this location before and the staff is always very nice and friendly but we experienced something very different this time we went. From the moment we arrived our server was rude to us. She never told us her name (She has short dark redish hair) I am a server and I understand that you can have a bad night but you shouldnt take it out on other customers. The bar was about half full so it wasnt like it was extremely busy but it took over 20 mins to get our drinks every time we put in an order. We ended up after the 3rd round of drinks just ordering from the bar. It took over 40 mins to get the chips and salsa we ordered. She also didnt know the prices of drinks. One of the members of our group was paying cash instead of starting a tab with a card and she kept telling her a different price for the same drink every time she order another round. To top it off she spilt a drink all over two people at our table plus someones phone. She didnt even apologize. Bartenders were very nice and there was a server with blonde hair and dark framed glasses that was extremely nice as well."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it was great. Waitress was very attentive even though we had a large group that was at 4 different tables. Tried 5 of the appetizers and loved them all. The margaritas were a little watery but it was happy hour so they were cheap."}
{"text":"Tacos were soggy and cold, not to mention worse quality than Taco Bell. Waitress got my order of tacos wrong and food took 30 minutes if not more to arrive, when people all around us (who got there after) were getting their food plenty faster. Waitress was then watching and hounding me to sign the receipt before I even had a chance to finish my food. Bummy place."}
{"text":"I live right down the road from here been here a handful of times usually at night on the weekend I do like the outside setting the drinks are decent if u go in the winter it does kinda suck if its chilly out.  The only thing I've had here food wise are the carne asada tacos and wow were they good didn't expect it. Atmosphere is up and down as well sometimes its easy to find a table other times it sucks. I haven't been here for a while so I don't know if anything has changed."}
{"text":"my review has been deleted, and my review explains my exact previous meal here. I'm only speaking the truth, not trying to talk trash just to ruin this restaurants reputation or no reason. They literally need to restart from the ground up. have you ever seen the movie The Waiting, will this is the place in real life. My father sent his food back because it was cold, and he told her to put it in the microwave and not to spit in it (no joke) she laughed and said, \" What do you think this is the movie Waiting\"???? I ordered the street tacos because it was there signature dish, it was incredibly cold and had a bunch of unedible fat. Thirty minutes after i ate i had the worst pain in my stomach and threw up consistently through the night ( end of the weekend for me. not half as bad as when we were playing pool and we saw a waiter with two plungers in one hand and cheese dip in the other hand leaving the kitchen and stopping thorugh the bathroom first!!! man how does the health department not shut this forsaken place down.  Nicholas"}
{"text":"Can you get the cook to wear a hairnet???? A blonde hair in out nacho dip as well as a breakfast burrito is disgusting!! Btw we have brown and red hair so clearly didn't belong to us!!"}
{"text":"I ordered two chicken street tacos with a side of rice.  The tacos were made with one corn tortilla. When I picked up the taco the chicken fell out of the bottom of the tortilla.  The rice was dry and hard.  I asked for fresh rice and basically got the same batch of rice.  This is the first Mexican restaurant where I had to pay for chips and salsa.  Will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Foods good enough.  Nothing great. The grilled shrimp and grilled Mahi flour tacos are my favorite. I don't drink so I can only rate the lemonade...as good. Tuesday nt is open mic night. Some humor."}
{"text":"A great place to have a few drinks during the week (they have awesome specials on drink and food).   The bartenders and staff are very friendly and extremely accomadating.  The place has a nice laid back ambiance.  Come as you are...sandals, tshirts, hoody..whatever.   They have a jukebox and serve grub till 2am.  This is my local favorite.  I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes there is a slight douche factor in the clientele is to be expected per the location smack dab in the center of old town.  Check this place out for a quick drink or just to hang out and relax in the sun.    Update: 3/2013  This place has gone downhill steadily over the past year or 2 since new management.  The majority of all the cool bartenders have quit or moved on..as a result alot of the regulars (like myself) dont come here nearly as much as they used to.  While it is still a cool place during the day for a cocktail, its no longer my first choice for a hangout at night.  Maybe its just that im sick of spring training?  The upper bar is my choice if i do happen to come by for a pre-show cocktail. Its usually a little easier to get a drink upstairs and the atmosphere is a tiny bit more relaxed.  Overall, its still a pretty decent place for a drink and some good folks still work here, but id much rather go to Pattys, coachhouse, pranksters, or grapevine."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chuck & Nicole, Our Favorite Bartenders......We Love You~?!.....And To Be Clear.....Shane & \"ALL\" The Staff~!   It's Our \"Cheers\"~!   This Time We Had Beer And Wings~!  YUMMO~!  THE DJ ROCKED THE HOUSE~!   We Just Love This Place~!"}
{"text":"Appeared to be a fun Rocky Point-style place that served food.  No one in the open-air perimeter had anything on plates on their tables!  (?)  Drinks were available with a trip to the bar--the \"margaritas\" are served in plastic containers for a history of misguided yoots catapulting the glass ones too much and the bottle of Dos Equis was luke-w.  If you enjoy a pounding heavy bass \"inner-city\" music, massive heavies mingling with the crowd (though friendly) and the Chandler PD standing by waiting, waiting...around 10 pm, then this is where you need to be.  The crowd seemed polite enough--have no idea why this is the gathering place it must be.  Not for us--maybe the atmosphere is different during the week.  ."}
{"text":"Terrible sanitary condition. Daughters burrito had a bit off nail in it and the General Manager had the nerve to say an I quote \"I'm not entirely sure the nail is ours\". Unbelievable. I will never go to a Dos Gringos again. I will encourage others to do the same!"}
{"text":"My party ended up here because of their dog-friendly outdoor seating. I was on a road trip and had my dog with me, so finding somewhere he could come was necessary during the arizona summer.  Our waiter was very attentive, brought my dog water quickly, and the food was great. The street style tacos were awesome, if a little pricey for what they were. But the beers were cheap, so that kind of evens it out.   In general, if you need to/want to bring your dog with you while hanging out and drinking some cheap beer, this is a good spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Came to Dos, and got served by Ally.  She was friendly and made sure we were well served.  Make sure to tip her well.  She is the Best!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Watched basketball there last night with a group of people. Fun and relaxed atmosphere with just the right amount of \"divy-ness\". We mostly drank but had a few apps. The chips and queso were great as well as the wings and shredded beef mini chimis. The waitresses/bartenders were super attentive. I couldn't believe how they were so on top of it with cleaning up plates and empty drinks and bringing us new ones. Probably one of my favorite places to go when I'm in town visiting. Will be back."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible. Chips and salsa takes 20 minutes to arrive to our table and glasses of water took a good 10 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"If you appreciate a good dive bar, you will love this place!  We came here for the first time when our team was playing in Glendale.  Dos Gringos played host to all BCS fans and it was a blast.  They have giant Jenga, dancing, multiple levels & bars and a great outdoor space. The facilities are a little beat, definitely a place where you don't want to touch anything in the bathroom, at least when it is packed.   The bar staff does a good job of managing the crowd and I never felt like I was wasting time begging for them to ask me what I wanted.  We returned for a bachelorette party and although we still had a good time, I think this place really thrives when you are with a huge group.  Food is decent, but not why you come here."}
{"text":"The food has always been good and the servers are always amazing! Its a cool place to hang out, but unfortunately is one of the only bars in gilbert so its kind of the only places to go.. and its usually older people."}
{"text":"This review is for the Chandler location.  The food here is pretty good. We came here twice during my last visit to AZ. We tried the nachos, the 7 layer dip, the guac and chips. The nachos were really good (make sure to add steak or chicken, both are great), and they give you a lotta guac too. The 7 layer dip was kinda dull, like they scooped out the filling of a microwaved bean and cheese burrito. Either way, all their food is pretty cheap, and during happy hour, drinks are a great deal. Also, I like the way the place is set up; most of it is outdoors/patio, so it makes for a different experience. There's also a lot of games and things to do. We saw a group of guys playing beer pong on one of the tables, and by the women's restroom there's a lobster catching game. We'd spent like 12 bucks on that game and didn't win ourselves a lobster but we got close one time, and it was pretty damn fun."}
{"text":"Loved the specials and service! My husband and I decided to stop in for a quick bite and some margaritas yesterday for happy hour and the specials were outstanding! My margarita was $3 and the nachos we shared were HUGE and only $7! Our waitress was Amy and she went out of her way to explain the specials and what the restaurant was all about since this was our first visit. She compared the restaurant to Rocky Point in Mexico, and surely the atmosphere resembled it. It was refreshing to receive quality service, enjoy fresh food, and not pay a penny over $20 at the same time! Will return soon!!"}
{"text":"Mucho Crapo By The Rue  The only reason this gets two stars, Is becuase of the patio and the bar,  Also because it isn't too far, I've even had them double charge my card.   They charge to much for a brew,  The food is mediocre at best if only I knew, I would have hit a Del Taco drive through, Not even worth going to look for someone to screw.  The tacos were tiny and at six bucks, I could have gotten a Double Del Delux, You're just a trendy name for the college f**ks, When ASU is playing Oregon you route for the ducks.  I really doubt I'll come in here again, Not with an enemy or even a friend, It seems that your greed has no end, I don't care if it's $2 you call it's starting at ten.   Uno Crappo!"}
{"text":"REALLY disappointed.  Server got our orders wrong, took a while to get to the table and it was cold. I almost cried lol I was starving. :("}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better and better. It seems like they keep promoting the right people. I can call this place home. From the bar back to the management they all seem to cater to me.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get wasted and get your grub on at the same time. It can get toasty in the summer, and you might get wet when it rains but generally at night it is a nice place to chill.."}
{"text":"The decor is awesome. The food was ok - expected a little more based on the menu and the decor. The service was terrible however. The waitress didn't ask what style I wanted my tacos and then messed up the order. Not particularily impressed."}
{"text":"This staff is the rudest bunch of people to work in a restaurant. They make you feel like they want you to leave as soon as you sit down, and ordering anything was the biggest imposition on our waitress. I could almost hear her sigh heavily when we asked for water and when she brought a pitcher the cups were floating on the water inside the pitcher. I dont want her fired, I want her to quit because she clearly hates working there."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, drinks, and service at best.  Didn't have a great selection of liquor, the tacos were super greasy  and the servers hardly ever came by without being flagged down (it was not busy at all).  Let's just sat I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Nice bang for the buck, generally a young crowd, has a cool Mexican cantina feel."}
{"text":"Ewwww!  Fun looking place, but as a first timer I was thoroughly disappointed.  Happy hour on Friday and was shocked at the lackluster drinks.  If you don't want beer, don't come here!!  Margarita was tasteless and so iced/watered down thought it was lemonade.  Ordered a cocktail and 3 times in a row it was not made correctly at all.  Again, weak & watered down... and it was a pure alcohol cocktail, no mixer!!  Food... chips/salsa & some other chip mess... should have went across the street to Costco & got some 3# bag of chips & cheese whiz!"}
{"text":"Ordered a margarita, had a long black hair on it, waited 20 min for server to come back \"oops, that'd be mine hahaha\".  Charged me for it, \"I don't have authority to give away drinks\".   Filthy, filthy, filthy. Can't wait to see John Taffer have this location on his show and rip it apart as its disgusting."}
{"text":"We went in 4:10 on a Sunday afternoon. There were people sitting at the bar and about 3 tables occupied outside. One couple inside who hadn't been served anything at the time we entered. Sign said to seat yourself. 5 waitresses walking around made eye contact but never came over, smiled, nothing to acknowledge our presence. Finally after about 10-15 minutes, someone came over. She got 2 menus when there were 3 of us. Took our drink order and came back with water, chips and salsa, and our drinks. My iced tea was without a lemon (a first for me) when I tried to get the waitress to come back she just kept walking. I have a pretty loud voice. Another 15 minutes of more waiting and I shouted to get the attention of a different apathetic waitress for her to get a manager. The manager came over and try to make it better but I had enough got up and left. Even if the food is good I'll never know because I won't go back due the crappiest service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass! Had a ton of fun there on our spring training voyage. Can't wait to jam back out there and see Melissa. Best waitress of all time. I said it!!!! Miss her already."}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY!!!! Food is good drink prices are average. Service at the bar is usually good but if you sit a table away from the bar don't expect great service the waitresses have way too many table and basically they will get to you eventually, yes you will have to ask for a refill or maybe just bring your cup to the bar and ask and get it yourself. If you want a waitress that will never let your drink pass half, this is not the place for you. On the other hand they DO NOT CHARGE for soda and tea. They have cornhole, giant Jenga and giant connect 2 games to play. They also allow smoking and dogs. Okay to bring the kids but prob not after dark"}
{"text":"I love the the street tacos but the service isn't great. The staff is very friendly, it just takes way to long to get food and drinks. We have waited over 10 minutes to be greeted multiple times."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here quite often. It's always a pleasant experience. They have amazing food, delicious drinks, great service, and friendly and fun bartenders that keep us coming back for more. Prices are reasonable especially for the area. We usually like to pre party here but it's a great way to end the night also. I am a huge Dos Gringos fan and will always be."}
{"text":"Came to this location on a Saturday night. It was pretty dead with a few customers. The bartender was really nice and we told him it was our first time there. We ordered chips and salsa with a martini and beer. The chips were great but the martini tasted like juice so we decided to order two shots of my favorite grey goose vodka to get the alcohol kicking.   Things got awkward quickly because the shots tasted like water with a hint of alcohol. My husband hesitated on saying anything because we hate complaining but it was pretty disappointing.  When the bartender came by, my husband politely told him that he isn't trying to say that it was the bartenders fault but the shots we got tasted like water. The bartender immediately got annoyed. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he poured us shots and left it at that. My husband even said that he understands it's probably not the bartenders fault and that we didn't want anything else but thought it would be good for him to know. We've worked in restaurant before and know that sometimes management will water down the bottles. The bartender walked away and we got our check and left after paying.   Unfortunately, we won't be coming back to this place. it was really clear that the staff  had no interest in retaining new customers who were excited about finding a new place to enjoy their weekends.   When I worked in the restaurant business, I alway made sure that first time customers would be a returning customer. Our shots were $9/shot and that's pretty expensive when you feel like you drank water."}
{"text":"9 bucks for a margarita that tasted like pure sour mix. Rude staff. Bathroom was disgusting and only one stall had a working lock on it. The food has zero flavor with the added bonus of indigestion. If you are ever forced to go, stick to beer and save your appetite for Filberto's later."}
{"text":"Every Taco Tuesday with friends are the best! Food is great and the service is always good and super fast"}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative reviews. They just suck. Every time I come here they suck no matter who the Watress is thru take forever and come around every 45 minutes"}
{"text":"So I came here twice, once for happy hour and once at night.  I would not come here just for the food, even though I hear their food is pretty good and the menu is huge.. Visually, the atmosphere doesn't strike me as a place id like a nice \"hot plate\" from, but rather just drinks and maybe some tacos to go.   For Happy hour its cool, and I would recommend. They have cool bartenders and a cool crowd.. Id pass on the Night life here. The crowd isn't very attractive, not just on looks but over all. Bad night idk?"}
{"text":"Sooooo..... Fight night. There we are. Every single fight. And lo and behold, KIDS are allowed at the bar until God-knows-when. Seriously. Children. In a bar. They were permitted to enter under \"parental supervision\" however, NO PARENTS to be found. The staff doesn't seem to mind. IT'S A COMPLETE BUZZ KILL. Also, total lack of seating for the absolutely expected crowd of games/fights/whatever is going on. Ridiculous. My point is...... STOP ADMITTING CHILDREN. This is NOT a family environment."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is a hit in the nightlife-starved Mesa. The scene is a lot different than the one you'll find in Tempe or Scottsdale however, but the bar is packed most nights of the week.  The large bar features umbrella-covered tables, two floors and a menu with items such as burros, enchiladas and sandwiches.   You'll find more of an older crowd typically and lots of families. When the bar first opened, I couldn't get past the amount of kids running around a bar at 9 p.m. Thankfully this didn't last much later than 9:30."}
{"text":"Dos is my favorite Scottsdale bar because of the relaxed atmosphere. Thankfully you don't get as much of the fake crowd here, you know the one whose crazy photos end up on DirtyScottsdale.com the next day. There's two floors and the bar offers a nice selection of brews. SoCo Lime is the big shot here and you'll usually see people sipping Corona's with lime. You may even see the occasional body shot. While this is certainly a great destination for a night out, it's also a great place to do some day drinking when the weather isn't so hot."}
{"text":"Good times Dos.   I can always rely on Dos to be open and serving food until 2 am.  Even in the rain.   Nothing is better than a bucket of beers and a 6 pack of street tacos.    The food is always good at anytime but the service might be a little slow.  Finding a table that isn't sticky is a trick but I can bring my friends and our dogs so it's definitely worth it.   You just have to belly up to the bar for the best service.    Come to Dos to eat and drink and watch the UFC sometime.  It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went last night about 5 p.m. Bar area outside dining room sort of busy - only one other couple in dining room, about 4 couples playing pool. The deco is great. The live music was great. The food was horrible. The beans tasted like the pan scorched. I got two tacos, one was ice cold and the tortillas was wet, from what, I don't know, I didn't eat it. The pica de gallo tasted funny. The waitress never refilled out drinks and we only saw her when she took our order and when she brought our check. I didn't want to leave a tip but my husband left a small one. I will never eat there again. Only go if you are only drinking."}
{"text":"I, and I'm sure many others in the Phoenix suburbs, would gladly pay a little extra for some standards.  Is pretentious overcompensating downtown Scottsdale the only place to find AZ night life that doesn't celebrate sub-par lifestyles?  Dos Gringos is certainly a dive.  I might rate them a 2star (as at least it's not a fight friendly 'unsafe' dive), but the background music is so ridiculously loud you can't hear the others at your own table over the off key guitar soloist with his amplifier maxed out."}
{"text":"Worst \"Mexican\" dive I've been too. We sat ourselves outside in front of the huge opening and was \"greeted\" by some rude female college student. She asked us what we wanted to drink which we said she came back with one drink when we meant for everyone as we said WE'LL start off with not I. Then she proceeded to come back and take our food order after stating are you guys gonna order food to or what. Very unprofessional as I was Hooter's girl in Peoria I would've never done that to a paying customer. On top of that all I wanted was two corn shrimp tacos and a side of beans and rice which she failed to understand resulting in my sister having to order for me? Later one she switched us to the unbecoming Erin with the resting b face. Also, chips and salsa aren't free chips are $3.00 and salsa is $1.00 which the first female told us was to compensate for the minimum wage raise. How unprofessional to let us know your being overcompensate in chips to help this dying company with their wages. Pathetic. Do yourself a favor and go to Anaya's, Garcia's, La Parilla Souza and else were."}
{"text":"Went here last night for paint nite.  Not a bad place but also nothing truly special. Very generic tacos and margaritas.  We got the queso dip for 8 bucks and 5 street size tacos for 10 bucks. The margaritas were average. Again nothing special setting this place from any other Mexican food stop.we ordered a starter and the tacos. They came at the same time and before our drinks.   I'd probably try another location."}
{"text":"I work at Target.com off priest and so before going in I decided to stop by this place and I ordered shredded chicken nachos to try them out they were $9. It was nice size portion, worth the money i paid for it. I wouldn't say the same for the guacamole it was an extra $1 put wasn't that big. Very good wouldn't mind taking others there to try it!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to day drink, but that's about it. I've eaten here a number of times and it has always left something to be desired. Food is very average."}
{"text":"We found this place not busy at 6:30 on a Friday evening so good for us to get a seat but one wonders their busy time - maybe later for drinking.   The guacamole appetizer was the best part of the meal as the fish tacos below par.    There is no pretense here about being upscale.  It seems set up to be a neighborhood bar mainly for drinking with the food to have something to do between drinks."}
{"text":"On a early Saturday evening, the band was playing the crowd was just starting to meander in.  Going further inside in an attempt to avoid the high volume of the band whose audio was piped in throughout the restaurant (I failed) I realized shortly that I must of been missed siting in the middle of the dinning are as the wait staff moved smartly from the kitchen to the front delivering the drinks and food to the patrons. I ask a member of the staff was I sitting in the wrong area and soon service was rendered.    Food, nothing special but it is more of a bar than a restaurant.  Although the atmosphere was unique, I do have a question why cameras were in the mens room."}
{"text":"Stop by here my first time in old Town Scottsdale after dropping off an application in the area.. It was 1, i had an annoying day so far, I felt like having a drink. It was fairly empty but started to get busier while I was there, I had 2 margaritas that were great and the bartender was pleasant enough without overwhelming me and she was incredibly easy on the eyes.. Will go back here again sometime for the cheap drinks, divey atmosphere and the excessive day drinking that im sure goes on here"}
{"text":"The key is to keep your expectations low.  Don't be in a hurry.  Expect to hang out, have great conversation, pretty good mexican food, cheap but good drinks and a good time.  You go for the atmosphere (seriously and ally between two buildings with Jenga made from 2x4's) and lights strung from the trees- but you stay when you eat, drink and only have a $20 bill for two people.  I love it.  Apparently four stars worth.  Probably a fifth star if the tables weren't always sticky.  But that's not enough to keep me away. (I recommend the ooey, gooey, cheesy, something something and more cheese burrito)."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is always a great place no matter when you go.  The recently re-modeled their inside to make it more fun!  They have full size Jenga, beer pong, Golden Tee, a Ms. Pacman machine, bean bag toss, and more.  They always have great drink specials and a friendly staff.  On my most recent visit, the manager bought our first round of drinks because he thought we waited to long-great service!  Food is good too."}
{"text":"This place has to be the worst establishment in the whole world. I mean not only are the waitresses rude and trashy the security does a horrible job as well. They accused my good friend of being drunk when he had not even had a sip of alcohol. He was actually the whole groups DD. The security was very rude to him during this too. My friend was very embarressed because he had not even been drinking and was now the reason that the whole group had to leave. It was an awful experience. Me and my friends will never be back to this place. I'm surely going to recommend that everyone I know not eat here or drink here. The most unprofessional professionals there are."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the bartenders are awesome. Come here all the time and have really nothing to complain about... I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a good time in old town!"}
{"text":"I had the green chili street tacos and they were really tasty but also really small, leaving me unsatisfied. Also they don't offer chips and salsa on the house while you wait for your food.  The heaters over the table (outside patio) left me feeling like I needed to be flipped over or I'd burn. Then before we were done they turned off, leaving us freezing. Overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is for getting blasted drunk and that is it. The food is okay, but the waitresses and bartenders mostly have chronic resting b!tc*!face and get worse if you tell them they forgot to put meat on your tacos or fries....if you are a white guy or two white guys going to get blasted and look at chicks, this is your place. Other than that, spare yourself the experience."}
{"text":"went here on taco tuesday right before happy hour was ending  Tacos are small and mehhhhhh all three of us thought the tacos were gross and TINY!  Drinks were nasty !!!!!  the outdoor area is super cool looking but the place is just not that great probably wont be back ..there are much better places to go"}
{"text":"We came to Dos Gringos for Happy Hour on Cinco de Mayo. Arriving at 5:30pm, there was a mandatory $7 cover charge. We proceeded into the restaurant to eat dinner and have some margaritas (that barely had any tequila). There were no specials, and even things like chips and salsa had a surcharge. Other restaurants in the area were doing specials, but we were already inside by the time anyone told us that they weren't offering food or drink specials. This will be our last visit, because this is greedy and wrong."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, awesome service. What more can I say?  Went in last night craving tacos, sat on the patio, and was greeted immediately by my server, who introduced herself as natasha. She was very nice to my friends and me, cracking jokes and telling us about the menu. It was so refreshing to see a server who enjoys her job and has a good time with her customers.  We ordered the nachos, which she suggested, and loved them.  Will be coming back, no doubt!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this gets 2 stars is because the tacos we had were actually good.  The server pulled a bit of a bait and switch with the daily specials included and didn't include, giving us quite a surprise with the final bill.  After saying she was deducting half off for some of the items, the bill was somehow only reduced by a couple bucks.  Give me a break.  WATCH YOUR SERVER and WATCH YOUR BILL!"}
{"text":"Only reason i gave 5 stars is because the staff and bartenders are the best the food tho horrible but ill tell u what if u wanna go somewhere and have a great Friday or saturday night this is the place"}
{"text":"This place can be a little rough sometimes but I've always met nice people willing to share a drink with you. Tacos are cheap and beer is decently priced."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the bartender Jen (service) and the ability to create whatever dish I want. I change it up often and they dont even question it. On the contrary they encourage it. I haven't had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"Teenie Tiny tacos but very tasty.  Green tomatilio salsa was delicious.  Drinks were very refreshing and our waitress Baronica was awesome."}
{"text":"Christine's Cadillac Margaritas are a total hit every time! She makes the bar a very enjoyable place for me and my girl to hangout, she knows exactly what we like and makes us feel at home every time. Love the place and love her!"}
{"text":"3 Stars for a dirt bar that knows it's a dirt bar.  There is no Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde here, only a cheap Hyde that loves to peak at the waitresses' whaletails and a decent Happy Hour special on Mexican beer.  That's all.    I guess my one gripe would be that every guy is a tough guy at this place. Really.  I used to have it as my Happy Hour destination, and it was pretty good for that, but once the darkness sets in, the real Scottsdale lunatics emerge!    (Oh, and it's obvious that the owners rake in a ton of money and are the greediest bastards under the sun for not changing simple things like the water misters that spew water constantly.  Ladies, don't wear anything nice to this place because the seats are stained from the misters and tough guy sweat.)"}
{"text":"i was gonna rate it 4 stars beacause i hate one of the bartenders but after reading liz b's review it gets 5 stars because everything she says is what i want in a bar.  you want service and a wonderful time go to the waterfront"}
{"text":"You kind of have to know what you're getting yourself into when you go to Dos.  Chances are there will be drunken college kids, some people way too old to be there, and then some people like me and my friends, who are somewhere in-between.   I was there on Saturday for a day drinking birthday pub crawl.  For some reason, I always forget they have food here, and not just refreshing adult beverages.  I ordered the mini chimis, which were definitely NOT mini.  That's ok, I like 'em big anyway ;).  They were surprisingly good.  My margarita was what I expected, not mind blowing in anyway, but straight forward and salty, (just on the rim).  There were also girls handing out free shots of tequila, and sweatbands.    Like most bars anymore, they have the obligatory giant jenga.  As my friends were playing, excitement broke out in the bar as some guy who used to be on \"The Bachelor\" showed up.  I couldn't tell you who he was; reality shows are not really my thing.  My friends were impressed, and went over to infiltrate his gathering.  Eventually we convinced them the crawl must go on, Bachelor or not.    I'm always surprised that I still like Dos, and it doesn't hurt that the same hot bouncer always seems to be working the door every time I go.  As I exited out the front, he told me that he liked my hat.  Had I been a little quicker on the draw, I would've told him that I liked his muscles; such are the perils of day drinking in the heat....but I digress."}
{"text":"This place is fun I had a great time with friends and family games and the quotes on the wall makes this place really entertaining !! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Every time I ever go there the waitresses and bartenders act like we're doing them some service by coming. They don't treat us friendly they don't smile they don't like even act like they like you. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I go to Dos Gringos for every UFC fight. I went last night for the UFC fight and that may be my last at Dos Gringos. The food was awful. There was 6 of us and not one of us enjoyed our food. The service was almost non existent. They are now asking for a cover charge which is good if it was comparable to other places that require cover charges. They really need to step it up for fight nights!!"}
{"text":"I love yelp and want to be a fair reviewer. Went in late Sunday night craving some tacos and wasn't expecting much after the last 2 visits. This time however sat at the bar again and the bartender did a great job getting us a beer and taking our orders. Paid great attention to everyone and even noticed the guy sitting between myself and a couple came in drunk and annoying and let him know politely he was cut off. The food was ok but the bartender did a much better job than any of my recent visits. Kudos"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. First we found Mosquitos in a drink but we figured its an open air restaurant so fine we decided to stay. Big mistake. More bugs in food and then a finger nail in our daughters burrito. When we complained the manager had the nerve to say 'I'm not entirely sure that nail is from us'. My daughter had blue nail polish. If it was hers we would have known. Horrible way to treat customers. I can deal with things and people making mistakes but hate lack of accountability and the nerve to blame the customer. Never going here again!"}
{"text":"I always like to look at reviews before coming to a restaurant. And after coming here... I realized it was my fault for choosing this place bc reviews don't lie.  The service was good up until the order was taken. Then he disappeared all night. We had to wave him down or get up to actually get our server to come serve us. Ridiculous. If I wanted to serve myself, I'd stay home. Lol Then it was pulling teeth to get our check and he was so preoccupied talking to other servers all night that he ended up screwing up the check. Ugggh! Growing up in the restaurant business and being a server myself, I don't stand for anything less than what I'd give to my customers. This place needs to understand good service and until then.. there are a lot of better Mexican food out here in Az. Dos Gringos I will pass next time for sure! Thanks, but no thanks!"}
{"text":"Good greasy american mexican food. The hummus burritos are wonderful."}
{"text":"All around pretty fun place to be. Its a good hybrid between a dance club and outside bar. I went their my first night in the valley. I remember looking and seeing more breast implants than I'd seen in my entire life up to that point."}
{"text":"In a word: forgettable. This is AZ, you can get better mexican fare on any corner. Largely bland and uncreative, food was just ok. Service was good, food was more than it was worth."}
{"text":"Really great experience, the food was awesome and I loved the staff. I was bummed it was jammin' busy for how awesome i thought it was so, GO CHECK IT OUT! I live to far away to go there regularly but I would go all of the time if they had one in North Phoenix. The manager was extra cool and made sure we were good at all times. When I go to the eastside it will be my go to Mexican Grill!"}
{"text":"Slow but fun....just don't expect to eat or drink fast ....."}
{"text":"Dos is our go to spot for mexican food and a corona just about every week. Good food, good prices and great service at Dos in Chandler. We have gone to some of the other valley locations when we have been nearby them but the one in Chandler on Alma School has the best service hands down. Highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Watch out, waitresses alter credit card receipts! Horrible service and it was a slow afternoon during happy hour. Waitress was snappy and largely absent. Food was eh. I gave her a 10% tip reflecting poor service. She later changed the amount on receipt to pay herself more! I contacted GM. He didn't seem surprised or concerned by her behavior (must happen often). But he was adamant about giving me refund. Been almost a month and still getting the run around. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Damn... with all there reviews.. all over the place.. excellent, bad, my regular stop, never gonna eat there again....... I'm going tonite.... wish me luck...... will actually post a review... tonite..........DAMN!!! WHAT A RAT HOLE!!! REALLY YELP?? dive bar and restaurant??? You got the dive part right.... waitress was good until she delivered the bill... waited twenty minutes for her to come back before I went to the bar and told the man.. do you want to get paid or not!!!! Food was ok.. but as you can see, it's like we were in the storage room..... never ever again.... oh well I don't know how to add the pic of all the boxes laying on the tables, booths, and concrete floor... so if ya want to be ignored, get shit faced, and eat at the bar, this dive bar is for you.... all the drunks can entertain your childrens.... have a nice day.."}
{"text":"This food sucks! Sorry just my opinion chicken wings were old or the chicken was! Not really a good selection of different things to eat, no chips or salsa. A $14 chimichagas was loaded down with nasty soggy something that clearly was not worth it. I guess you have to be drunk to enjoy the food there. Please find somewhere else to go this place is the worth going to dinner at. Taco bell and filibertos are far better place to go eat. And the prices are way too high for what we ordered $32+tip please save your money find somewhere else to go!!!"}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food!   Went there for lunch so that way wouldn't have to go pull my car  out of the garage. Was greeted by the bartender and ordered a coke. She then handed me a menu. A little pricey but I decided on the shrimp tacos for $4  and added rice and beans for another 3 here's a novel idea why don't you just make a taco plate  without the upcharge? No chips and salsa were offered for munching on while I waited. And needless to say their tacos are very tiny I think I had one shrimp on each taco smothered in mango salsa. The tortillas they come on are gross. The rice was cold and crunchy and the beans were extremely salty. What a waste of time. Stay away from their food. It is not Mexican food!!!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Waitress completely ignored us for about 20 mins. Went to Bogeys instead."}
{"text":"Doug the manager was so great to work with in planning my 30th birthday. The staff was so accommodating, and the upstairs room was perfect. I highly recommend anyone who wants to have a laid back and chill event to consider this venue. The staff and manager were both excellent, and the food was great. Thank you for a fantastic party!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and waited forever for the waiter to come take our order of drinks. Place wasn't busy at all so that was weird.  It took super long to get the drinks too. The margaritas were supposed to be blended, but came on the rocks and in plastic cups. One of the worse tasting margaritas I've ever had."}
{"text":"Advertised $20 cover for the Mayweather fight on Saturday.  We got there before the fight and security said it would be $40.  We asked why since it was advertised for $20 and the bouncer said \"because we can.\" We paid and went in.  The place was pretty busy because of the fight and they had 2 people working at the bar so the service was slow.  They didn't even have the sound on for the fight so it made for a strange atmosphere.   Overall, it is just a dirty bar & restaurant that worked in college at the location by ASU.  There are certainly better places to go."}
{"text":"Hard to tell which was colder: my beer or my burrito. The service was non-existent. And had to beg for chips and salsa. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I ever had .  The bartender with the Detroit hat , threw my id back at me , slammed my drink on the counter .  This place is a shit hole with shit service .  Be smart and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Had delicious tacos on Taco Tuesday. Margaritas were good and for only $1 more you can have a shot of Grand Marnier. I recommend the place."}
{"text":"Great food, great drink specials (especially if you like Corona, bloody Mary's or Mimosa's) and a great Mexican vacation like atmosphere. DOS is one of our favorite weekend escapes for some quick fun in the sun. Definitely recommended for a mid-day snack/lunch and drink."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, cold beer. PM DJ needs to play country. Enough of this garbage music."}
{"text":"This location has a big patio and a different clientele than the Scottsdale location (which is the only other Dos Gringos I've been to).  I had never been here before, and at first I thought that the restaurant was the nursery section of a Home Depot or something.  It's not too pretty, but it's functional.  The staff were friendly.  Our server was on top of food and cerveza orders.  I went on a Sunday, and they had $3 Coronas all day, which was nice.  They have a giant Jenga-type game, and bean bag toss game on the patio, which would be fun, except for that when I went there was a motorcycle club hogging all the space."}
{"text":"We have been comming here for months every tuesday or thursday always had great service. Today our server kyle was amazing. But unfortunetly we had to leave due to the bartender and management kicking us out. Very unprofessional and on top of that theleft poor kyle take care of 20+ peoples checks and the semi bald douchbag with a yellow shirt that kicked us out didnt even bother to help her. We believe it was her first day. Either way we are never comming back"}
{"text":"The worse \"mexican\" food I have ever had! I am white and I can prepare more authentic mexican food. But can't expect much from a bar."}
{"text":"Yuck. It's cold there are no heaters. Went in on Mon nt and instead of NFL they had BIG BANG THEORY on all TVs. $15 for 5 Coronas and not enthusiastic service. PASS!"}
{"text":"Service was really slow. We were told to get of our iced coffees because there was no outside drinks allowed, but then our waters sat at the edge of the table empty for 20 minutes before a refill. We even asked the bartender if he could get us water but he said he couldn't. :("}
{"text":"So, this one time, I went to a really nice, classy, Mexican food restaurant... but not this time.  That being said, I love going to Dos Gringos, but you have to be prepared- it's very much like the college bars in Mexico.  Yet, I really like it there.  It could be my casa away from my casa.  The patio is huge and a lot of it has misters for us overweight sweaty bastard types, but I am not sure when that last time they hosed down the tables... ever?  If you are short on cash, you may get a good buzz walking around licking the tables... and they would be cleaner then too!  WOO HOO!  Also, assuming you like sitting on seats made of 2X4s painted like a clown threw up on them and tables that need to be sanded (and wiped down, I reiterate), yet decent food and cheap-ish drinks, this place is for you.  They do have an inside section, but from what I have seen, most of the fun is outside.    On the normal weekend night, you get your typical Scottsale DBs who need to put their sleeves back on the shirt that their moms paid for as they are $30K a year millionaires, sorority girls-gone-wild types who don't care about anyone but them and their BFFS, and a fair amount of the overly sensative hipsters who could really use a shave and some deodarent, but despite all of that, it's still fun.  Oh, and you will be able to pick the first timers, tourists, and 'parents' out of the crowd for sure.  And if you have other plans, I would not recommend going here before you go anywhere else as you are bound to get dirty or spill, but it's a great way to end the night and that's just Dos Gringos.  Service- tattooed chicks with big boobs... +++ (and some dudes) but all very nice and good service Food- decent- it didn't give me poo-cano and they use a lot of cheese which is never a bad thing unless you are my Dr., then I only had the veggies.  Oh, and try the habanero sauce on the side- it will grow hair on your sack and force a re-manscape ASAP!  Muy bien! Atmosphere- VERY relaxed, and some could argue too relaxed if you like a little structure Other- plenty of room to dance between the booths, jenga, decent music, but best of all, $1 Donkey Punch shots all the time!  Be careful, these bad boys are the cousin of the Dirty Sanchez for a reason!"}
{"text":"I have been here once, and had about 9 whiskey/cokes... for 14 bucks!!!! Great service and bouncers are nice too. Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Ok, family-style review.  We ate there recently with our teenagers on the patio outside.  I like the atmosphere.  To me it's a little touch of a bar atmosphere, but not too much, a chance to give the kids a feel for more adult atmosphere w/o feeling like we are too permissive by exposing them to drunks.  I had the relleno.  Whatever it was coated in was too cruncy and fried.  I love rellenos and I did not care for the Gringos version.  Rest of the family liked their food and we will probably return.  Is it the best Mexican food, no, and it probably wouldn't be the first place we would think of when we are hungry for Mexican."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the worst dining experiences Ive ever had. Server seemed annoyed every time she came over to our table and kept saying they were really busy. Food was awful, I ordered the Gringo Wrap and gave up on it half way through. Our server followed up by pouring ice on me and delivering the wrong drinks to us. I informed her about the mistake and she apologized and left to bring me the correct drink. A few minutes later she returned to ask if we needed anything else, but still yet to deliver my correct drink. When I reminded her of this, she seemed upset and annoyed. Finally she returned with my correct drink (dos equis lager bottle). My date asked for the check and our server returned apologizing for the \"bad service\" and asked if she could \"get us anything for free\" because she didnt want us leaving \"with a bad taste in our mouth\". Too late, the Gringo Wrap already did that.  All in all, Im willing to write this off as a bad night for this server. It didnt appear busy to me, and I saw another server possibly training a third server. However it doesnt excuse the lack of management. No one ever came by to touch our table and ask how everything was. A capable manager should have at least helped this server run food and drinks."}
{"text":"So, I'm not exactly sure why I was cut off or kicked out. Because I spoke with the manager, and the security manager. And neither seemed to understand why I was kicked out, but neither seemed to be able to do anything about it either. They both said I was respectful to the server and staff. I had ordered one round of drinks for my friends, and paid 100% tip on top of the bill. Literally. But they said I was \"over served\" despite basically being very kind to the waitstaff and otherwise. So apparently, don't be kind to the waitstaff, bartenders, or other patrons or you'll be kicked out? Very bizarre. I spoke with the  security and bar management and they both said they didn't understand why that was the decision. But all my friends were inside that had been drinking for the same amount of time as me. So I'm not sure why I was flagged except that I'm friendly basically. A bit disappointing. Apparently not where you should go to drink if the point is to get drunk? Shame."}
{"text":"It is easily the best bar in east mesa.   Not like the other Dos Gringos.  It's more of a neighborhood bar.  Still fun they have a Dj on fri and sat.  Beeer pong and alot of other games to play.  And beach cruiser friendly!"}
{"text":"Tres Gringo's went to Dos Gringos.  Dive bar, almost college like.  The tacos were pretty good for the price.  The service here is hit or miss....the gals seemed distracted but they had a special event for a staff member that was injured so we just chalked it up to that."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant in a verrrrry long time. Went there with a group of probably around 15 people Saturday night. It took 45 minutes for our drinks to come out and half of them were wrong. About an hour after we ate, my boyfriend and I were concerned about where the food we ordered was. The waitress admitted she forgot to even put the food order for us two in! She had no idea what she was doing and had probably 3 other people helping her after more than one of us complained about the service. It was absurd."}
{"text":"So a couple coworkers and I went to celebrate an employee's new adventure. The service was wonderful I did have a minor issue once I got home. Though I called and spoke with the general manager Chris and he was wonderful listened to my issue and corrected it. While other places would probably have just brushed me off. I will definitely be recommending them to everyone I know from now on"}
{"text":"Thank you Victoria!! For being brought up to a bartender from a server so soon, you continue to have a great attitude, be on top of the regulars, as well as helping out your servers!!! I will definitely be back on your shifts!"}
{"text":"Five of us ate there, None of us enjoyed the food.  Too bad, has fun outside games to play.  Would be nice to go for drinks and play games."}
{"text":"My least favorite place to go to... Yes has plenty of early 20s women and men in there but.. Its like an after HS reunion. Service is a disgrace and the drinks are weak. Go if u want to be in a sweat box with a bunch of hood rats."}
{"text":"Thank you Nicole for always taking such care of us!! You always make our experience so fun and provide excellent service!!! We'll be back to see you soon!!!"}
{"text":"Dos Gringos always reminds me of good times.  Specially the one on Alma School and Knox.. Good times, good friends, 2 many wild things.. woohooo!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is super good. I recommend the carne asada nachos.  My other main recommendation would be the blended/frozen margaritas. I like coming here for some daytime drinking. Great open patio makes you feel like you are on vacation in Cabo."}
{"text":"I try not to dwell on bad dining experiences, but it's been years, maybe even decades since I left a goose egg tip.  The service stank.  I hadn't felt that invisible in years!  We sat and sat.  Then the wait guy came up and asked if we needed anything else.  This was because we sat down at one of the several tables that had not been bussed and had bottles and gunk still remaining from the last party.  When we made it more clear that wasn't our junk, he kind of smirked and acted like we were lucky he was going to do anything.  I asked for a round of margaritas and waters. He took my credit card away and I was not to see it again until we got the final tab.  I felt even more like a valued customer from this point on. We finally got the margaritas, but no waters. I asked again for waters; nope....   When we ordered, I asked for chips and salsa. In California, where I live, the Mexican restaurants just bring you chips and salsa, usually for free.  Ours came with the meal, so did the waters, finally.  This took, oh about 30 minutes.  Sorry, too late for chips and salsa.  I sent the chips back.  Anyway, the food was, at best, OK (Dos GRINGOES, right?  Maybe Gringoes shouldn't make Mexican food?).  After we ORDERED our food, the wait guy NEVER came back.  Our food was served by a separate team of servers.  They were fine and seemed to be trying to do a good job, the highlight of the meal.  The big problem was the waiter and waitress.  After giving up on the waiter, I tried to get the waitress's attention to get another drink.  This proved difficult also.  I asked for a margarita with salt; got one without.  I think it was one of the ones that was ordered by another table, because she came out with four drinks and dropped three off at another table before giving me mine.  The whole experience just sucked.  I felt like the wait staff didn't want to be there and were taking it out on the customers.  A customer at the table next to ours had to tell the waitress to pick up the tab folio because she never even looked our way again after dropping if off.  Never again.  I hated that place."}
{"text":"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Dos Gringos! A group of us were at your restaurant yesterday for an event. Your management and staff were friendly, courteous and beyond helpful. We had around 100 people in our group and were all served and happy! The food is great and the drinks generous! Thanks again! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I took my partner for his birthday there last night for dinner and drinks. It was such a waste of time and money!! The server was slow and the food was horrible! We had the super gooey chimmy and it was almost raw. What a way to ruin a birthday dinner. Thanks Gringos!!!! Never will I ever go again and will spread the word!!"}
{"text":"I like coming here. The drinks are relatively cheap and the bartenders/servers are friendly.   They allow you to open and close tabs on a whim and you can order from any bar or server in the place.  This is an awesome place and I recommend it."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite hangouts for fun, food and drinks. The service hasn't been consistent over the last decade, but it has definitely been going up again. There are finally servers who know how to keep you from going empty on your drinks and cooks doing a great job on the food. I have been very impressed with my last few visits and plan to make this a regular place to hang out again. Keep up the good work Dos!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots for tacos and margaritas, or a low key spot to grab a beer. I haven't heard of this location closing, I spent Halloween here - great times, as always."}
{"text":"I used to love coming in late and finishing my night in old town here because they have bomb food and great drink specials. Not to mention their awesome staff! But now I have to go to loco patron (which I hate) because it's the only place to get late night Mexican food. I don't know who the genius is who closed the kitchen but they did a great job of running off the majority of their business."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food , drinks are not bad. Service can't be beat."}
{"text":"Never come to this place or get takeout worst mistake I ever did and wasted my money. I'm disappointed with the place!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a sponsored event that included open bar and some free food.  There were only two servers at the one food station which caused the food line to be incredibly long.  The food options were also pretty limited (not sure if it was due to the sponsorship).  At one point of the night, the top bar had run out of Dos Equis, without a sign they were going to replenish.    The atmosphere and amenities are geared towards a younger crowd - unfinished wood tables and chairs.  Though the service a bit off, everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, it really is the \"perfect place to day drink!\" The service is always amazing, the food is even better!!! I have yet to have on thing on the menu that I didn't like. Try the Pork Chile Dip to start, finish with some Crispy Tacos...or for something lighter the Chipotle Chicken Salad is BOMB. Everyone there is always trying to have a good time, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always a great time!  Great people watching! Cold drinks.  Super friendly and chill staff!"}
{"text":"My experience with this place started out as a good one, fun atmosphere, not too crowded, plenty of activities even if you are the DD. Now as a Mexican restaurant/bar you would think they would have good tequila and know how to serve it.  I ordered a Patron on the rocks with a salted rim. What I got was warm Patron with 2 tiny ice cubes which melted on delivery and barely enough salt to see that it was even there.  I didn't get too upset at my \"drink\" and just switched to beer for the rest of the night. At the end of the night when I got my tab I saw that they had charged me for the 2 tiny ice cubes that they put in my warm tequila. To charge me for ice cubes when a glass of water is free is ridiculous. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"THE BEST DOS GRINGOS! By far the best there is. Not only do they have the best bartender (chuck) who makes you feel at home, he makes the best drinks and ALWAYS makes sure you're taken care of. The music is great, the drinks are great and the food even taste better at this location. I live 5 minutes from the Mesa one but I gladly make the 20 minute drive to dos gringos in Tempe."}
{"text":"Over a year later and their bar tenders still suck. The waitress's have always been friendly but it's those damn female bar tenders. I don't understand, it's your job, you tend to the bar.. Well you're supposed to. YOU NEED NEW BAR TENDERS!"}
{"text":"If I have to give it a star it is only because of their busty waitresses.   This is a miserable place, serving miserable food, with miserably loud music blaring at all hours of the day.  If you can imagine, it's a restaurant in Scottsdale trying to reproduce the worst aspects of places like Cancun. Got it?"}
{"text":"What a dump. My female bartender was nice but the place is filthy ... also the \"manager\" has been standing next to me for 30 minutes not doing anything, smoking, drinking, belching and talking about \"hot chicks\" on his cell phone to other employees ... classy. Posted a pic. Notice cigarette in hand, beer in front I think it's his second since I have been here - nice"}
{"text":"We had high hopes...close to our hotel, and we were in town for the Cubs spring training. I mean, after all, they advertise at the games, so it has to be good right?  Ugh...  We went TWICE in 2 days - both times sat outside (on a Thursday and a Friday). Both times the smokers, omg...smokers everywhere outside. We live in Vegas and are used to smokers inside, in the casinos..but even this was over the top...50% smokers outside and no designated spot....nasty.  The happy hour specials are nice, especially the mini chimi's - very tasty!  But here's where the problems arise...the SERVICE. Seriously...between this place and a few others in town, all we can say about Tempe is, it's not a \"service town\". We had got awful terrible service last night - we wanted to stay longer and order more stuff,  but good lord, we could not get a water refill to save our lives (some random dude finally came and asked if he could refill them - TWICE!) and then we were so fed up due to lack of service we decided to leave and go back our hotel room (at 6 on a Friday nite!) instead of waiting around for the terrible service to come back our way.  Mini chimi's are great....Cadillac margaritas aren't great (tastes like the happy hour ones which were significantly cheaper we assume as we discovered the following night) but the SMOKE is terrible, We ordered Corona Light by the bucket and were served Corona instead. We waited a REALLY long time in between the server stopping by...really? There are also no fans running outside (allegedly there were broken per an overheard conversation) so you cannot go until the sun is down as it will shine on your table and be wretchedly hot!  It looks so fun from the street...and we could have spent a few more hours there, but for gods sake, we couldnt order anything else because our server just stopped coming to see us! We were so pissed off we wrote that on the receipt. My husband who has never written a YELP review in his life felt compelled to write one on this place.  Such high hopes...but ugh...did not live up to what we hoped for. Much better service in our own hotel room!"}
{"text":"Best day drinking place in town bar none! The mood is light the crowd always varied & great prices."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! One friend got cut off because his tab was \"too high\" at $150 even though there were 5 of us!!! Worst service ever!!!"}
{"text":"Had Christine again! She makes the best Cadillac margaritas and has the coolest personality ever. Day drinkers rule!"}
{"text":"You will get kicked out if you and 20 of your friends end up in a dogpile. Even if its outside :) Kinda hot outside in the summer, but is a favorite in the spring and fall. Good young, single crowd most of the time. If you like this you might like the Sandbar too.."}
{"text":"Went there during the day after rocking out at Ikea. Best part: really good tacos, and great prices. Worst part, and this is what dropped the score to a three, no air conditioning, lol. It was HOT out, and made the lunch a little uncomfortable. This seems like more of a night spot, and I bet it would be a really chill place."}
{"text":"good place to drink after work or before midnight on weekends before it gets  crowded.  3 stars for the place but I'll give it a 4 because their steak nachos is awesome"}
{"text":"Don't spill your drink. They won't tell you that their policy is once it leaves the server's hands they no longer are responsible for it. Meaning you pay for another one. A friend spilled my 3/4 full drink, not me. Waitress asked if I want another one and I said sure. Bill came and I was charged for both. Took some complaining to get money back. They gave me cash instead of voiding the charge. I almost always leave a tip being that I worked in the industry and know how it is, but she never informed me of this \"policy\" which she should have which is a bs \"policy\". She was nice about it but I just couldn't leave a tip. That annoyed me too much."}
{"text":"Okay so update! I'm never giving any of my money to dos ever again after a less than desirable encounter with the bouncers.    Gotta do the only thing I can, let my money do the talking. I will enjoy a corona in a more friendly atmosphere. Maybe loco patron?"}
{"text":"I was here this past saturday for a rugby tournament after social.   Surprisingly, I had a lot of fun!  I am not sure if it was due to the good company I had around me... or the many drinks.   The atmosphere was probably the best part.  There is a 'Mexican' theme  and they have some entertaining signs all over :)  I loved that they had 3 different bars.  I kept going to the one inside because it had the best service!   Most of the bar is outside.  I love having fresh air and not being cramped inside a stinky bar.    I was really only drinking beer all night and I think it was like $3 or $4 domestics.  To me that is reasonable for a bar.   I noticed some good drink special signs for nights other than Friday and Saturday.    I would def come back here again!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I have had in the USA. Food was half warm and the green Chile pork tasted like left over and out of the can.The waiter is nice though."}
{"text":"I'm on a low carb diet and I had the fajitas sans tortilla and rice, added pico and avocado and it was delicious.  I would give the food a 4 but Jen, the bartender, makes this place a 5+. I travel a lot and meet a lot of people. This gal is a quality gal. She catered to my diet and is the epitome of great customer service. This is by far the best Dos Gringos I've ever been to because of the people that work there. I'm not going every day because I don't live nearby but I'll make the visit for those steak and shrimp fajitas and the customer service!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. Look at my previous reviews of other Dos and I am typically very fair. This place had a good server but the manager was lousy to say the least. We visit this place once a month and bring a group of ten to fifteen people with us so you would think they would provide quality service but two guys at the bar wanted to hear the game. I like football so I get it but the speakers were blasting so loud it actually hurt. We moved to another location and it helped a bit but another group came in and had the same complaint, they also moved. Manager insisted and wouldn't lower the volume because of the two gentlemen at the bar. So our group of twelve in a bar with 16 people in it would've been better off going elsewhere.  Customer service by management here was terrible.  We won't be back next month or anytime after that."}
{"text":"I agree.  This is not the same Dos you will find in Tempe or Scottsdale.  More food, older crowd, more families.  But it still has the outside patio that seems to be the driving force in AZ bars."}
{"text":"Awful! Customer service was terrible! The General Mgr with the red hair and beard was a douche! Our daughters friend had a finger nail in her food. My husband had a bug in his tea. And our son had a mosquito in his chips! The manager all but accused us of putting the nail in the food. Horrible! Never ever will we return!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during a business trip. Great, super casual atmosphere. Fantastic food and great service!"}
{"text":"The service to even get drinks out was about a 15-20 minute wait. Food was cold. Overall not the greatest experience"}
{"text":"There are very few times when I like to just go out  and get drunk and this place does the job.  $6 cab ride and a $40 tab will help me get to where I need to be.  I don't believe I ever went here during a week day so can't comment but the weekends can be interesting.  I always get a laugh at the people who are stumbling out of here at 2am.  Either that or I'm stumbling and they're walking straight but I believe its them stumbling.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good. That's about it. Very unfriendly and we were sitting at the bar!   Menu very ala cart."}
{"text":"Would have been fine if I didn't have to yell to get a bartenders attention. There were 3 girls behind the bar and all of them were too busy taking selfies to notice me. This was Saturday 7/8 between mid night and 2am.  working at a bar myself i was not impressed at all"}
{"text":"Awesome Restaurant with great fish taco and chicken fajitas!  Our waitress, Carly was so attentive and friendly!   Will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Crowd was laughable for starters. Went in on Friday night around 10 and it was pretty dead but eventually picked up. My friend and I basically sat and people watched all night which was very easy to do based on the crowd. The staff all seemed over being at work. Didn't come across one friendly Dos employee that night but what do I know? I don't work in a bar so maybe it sucks. If I do decide to visit a Dos again it will be the one in Chandler. Much better atmosphere. 2 stars instead of 1 because the drinks were good and cheap."}
{"text":"Used to come here almost every weekends while I was studying at Arizona State University.  Been going to their location in Tempe by the campus a lot before they moved and then closed.  I like this location because it's so far away from ASU and is in Old Town Scottsdale where a lot of other people comes.  Best time to come out is like I said, on the weekends where you will see a lot of people, young and old.  It might be very crowded if you come out late and you will definitely not be able to find a parking spot.  So come out early and stay out late."}
{"text":"I like the layout and atmosphere at this Dos Gringos. The had good prices on drinks and I thought their street tacos were really good. The crowd seems pretty chill and if it's too hot outside you can go inside like a wuss. I liked the Dos trailer park that used to be in Tempe as well but this one is better."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a party place. The bar area was pretty busy for it only being 5:30pm or so when i was there. We only stopped in for appetizer's so that is all i can rate on at this point. It was loud, the service was okay, and the food was just okay. I had planned on ordering a couple items but started with just the crispy tacos. I wasn't blown away so we stopped while we were ahead.   The crispy tacos: the shredded beef was alright the avocado salsa saved the little tacos, without that they would have had no flavor at all.   I would say try something other than the crispy tacos, i hear that the Rocky Point Nachos are good so maybe give them a go.   All-in-all my experience here was okay, not great, not horrible just okay."}
{"text":"Went to a retirement party. No one asked me if i wanted a drink or eat there. Had plans to eat but ended up eating chips and water .was there two hours"}
{"text":"It's your typical Dos Gringos, except located in a deserted strip mall, which is a bit odd but I guess good for parking.  Same setup as every other Dos in town, except the help here is sparse.  It's impossible to get a drink, whether you have a server or go to the bar, as it seems everyone is in super slow motion.  Very strange.  Overall, what you would expect from a Dos Gringos in east Mesa/Gilbert area. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is not my type of place.  I rarely drink or party or watch sports.  But I do love Mexican food and more specifically red chile burros (here in AZ).  By my own measure, I make awesome salsa.  Hot and flavorful both red and green.   The salsa at Dos Gringos was bland and tasted like a can of diced tomatoes was hastily pureed with an onion and some salt.  It was nothing special and that's sad because salsa is cheap to make.    The nachos we ordered tasted like Taco Bell's Nacho Supreme just in a bigger portion.  Even with black beans, the flavor was bland.   Okay, the upside: the weather is really beautiful right now and sitting out on the patio was really nice.  I couldn't have imagined a better way to kill an hour on Sunday.   Also, our waitress was moderately more attentive than most others.  The sign posted out front read '$4 Lunch Specials' but apparently this doesn't apply on weekends.  Why put out the sign then?  She still gave us our lunch for $4 bucks which is nice.  I don't think I'll go back unless I'm really, really bored."}
{"text":"I've been to Dos several times and always walk away thinking it was just ok.  I wanted a low key night.  Whereas I can't say low key-ness was had the entire evening, Dos was exactly what I had in mind.  The friendly bouncers informed us of the 50 cent night special every Thursday.  Pay $5 at the door, get 50 cent corona and wells until midnight.  SOLD!  Coming from NOLA where the drinks are insanely strong, I get a bit sad when I see the one shot pour perfectly calculated in my Scottsdale drinks.  Not the case at Dos.  I don't know why, but the awesome bartender upstairs was pouring heavy, and I liked it.  Speaking of, there IS an upstairs filled with a large patio, bar seating, pool table, air hockey and nooks to fit all your friends!  The upstairs and the heavy pouring bartender definitely turned my \"just ok\" feeling about Dos to \"let's go to Dos!\"  The food is average Mexican bar food but will definitely save you from the morning after blues.  The weekends can get a little intense and there is usually a band playing.  As of my latest visit they had stereo music playing accompanied by a live drummer. The outdoor/indoor options can transform the day/night to your liking.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Horrible service from the waitress \"management\". Drinks came out wrong, food came out wrong,(3 time), manager didn't even bring out food right. Only thing came out right was chips and salsa and water. If your staff doesn't know the menu of even the management, that is sad. Literally no apologies from the higher manager, waitresses talk crap behind our back and management can hear them laughing behind me. Manager said they were just talking about our situation but service so horrible just got up and left waitress said she was taking care of our tab. So then we left higher management chased us down like super not professional at all with a man, like they were going to tackle us or something. And we're two young adult females. Let say never going back there again, staff and management horrible. Never ever in my life had such horrible customer service. Do not recommend, unless you want your order to come out 3 different times wrong."}
{"text":"Warning, there are usually drunk people here...and 30 minutes after I get here, I am usually one of them.  I love Sunday Fun-day on the patio at Dos; always a great friendly vibe from the patrons and staff.  DO drink the FROZEN margarita.  I am normally not a fan of frozen margaritas, but they are very good here!  Also, I always eat their tater tots, but that probably has something to do with the drunk factor not culinary expertise.  There is this bartender, who is outstanding, but of course I don't know his name.  So that was basically a rather useless tidbit of information.  All I know is when I go to Dos he seems to be in tune with my salivary glands, because right when my drink is empty he gives me the nod to signal the next one is on the way."}
{"text":"In comparison to Chandler Gringos, I like this one much less. It was DEAD on a Friday night and nothing special going on with pricing. We got a drink and bounced out to the next place."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and helpful. Food was off the hook good. Everyone in our party loved what they ordered. I'd eat here all the time if I lived here!"}
{"text":"Perfect place in Chandler to go and get plastered. Food is actually pretty good.  If you're looking to party, definitely plan on sticking to Friday or Saturday unless you know for sure that there is an event going on."}
{"text":"Average food cheap beer. They are pretty standard but it is a good place if you want to get a cheap buzz. Used to go here a lot when I lived in chandler for the food."}
{"text":"Place is OK . Met here for happy hour on a Friday! Coronas were $3.50 and the food was well priced! Got four \" mini chimi's \" for $5 and our group of four people split the Mexican pizza $8 which was large and we had left overs! Place just seems like it has seen better days? They had garbage bags over the stools outside which was odd.  Music was odd as well played the grease sound track the. Lil yahty? I would go back just to much on some food and leave."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and low-key environment this place offers! I always have a great time while I'm here. My friends and I go about once a month and the bartenders and staff remember us by name, they are always attentive and helpful! I would recommend Dos Gringos to anyone looking for a light-hearted, fun time!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had the Tuesday taco special.  The tacos were very good.  The chips and salsa also were good.   It was hot in the restaurant, they need to turn the A/C on.  Also there was a lot of flies bothering me.     I'd go try again at night, maybe the cool the place down more then."}
{"text":"My review here is based solely on happy hour because I have never really been at any other time. This bar is really close to my work so we frequent it for the after work to wind down from time to time.  I always have a really great time. I like the outdoor seating when the weather is nice, I like that they serve black beans on most of their items rather than refried, I like the cheap buckets of Pacifico during happy hour and I love that they have corn hole or bags or whatever other term people refer to it as.   The table service is always really great and the waitresses have always been friendly, I've never had a poor experience with the staff. Some of the people that go there are pretty big D Bags which is annoying, but since I'm usually with a group of co-workers, I really don't mind.  All in all, this isn't where I'd choose to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night, but I will definitely continue to stop in for happy hour on those days after work when I could really just use a drink!"}
{"text":"Dos is what I like to call a \"sure thing\"  I say this because I know that I will always enjoy the food and always have a good time. I love the feel of Dos, the way everything is kind of everywhere and the outdoor atmosphere. While most people go for the cheap drinks and to be scene (intended spelling) I actually like Dos for the food and good service.  I love that they use black beans instead of the typical refried like most other mexican food joints. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a bar, and it's a fun place to start off a Friday night or grab lunch drinks."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Dos.  Friendly little outdoor/indoor dive with generous and tasty adult beverages, Fun staff and yummy Mexican menu. The decor is a work in progress - straddling the fine line between ghetto and some guy's tree house.   It's dog friendly on the patio which only adds to the \"What is this place\" atmosphere.  OK, it's a little quirky. But I like quirky.   But when I need a bit of South of the Border and can't afford the time nor the $$, a trip to Dos can be a great afternoon away. After a couple of shots, the eyes glaze over, the sun is warm, the music is good , the tacos are tasty and I'm happy.  They say it's a good place to day drink.  I say if you can't relax here, you'd best check with your physician.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Everybody knows what to expect of Dos...but I had to drop in and leave a five star review...I was in two weeks back for tax day and had the best experience ever here due to the most attentive server I've had at this location...her name is Chanel and she took care of my friend and I...being in the industry it's always nice to have a server that truly hustles...hats off to Chanel!"}
{"text":"I go here for the cheap happy hour beers and the company. I usually sit at the bar. The seating has gotten better but when they put the backs on the chairs people would lean back and almost break them. The cushions fabric on the chairs make you sweat badly and the concrete bar table will burn your arms in the summer and they are in the shade. The food is good and cheap. The bar waitress are good but sometimes you get that \"one\" who won't pay attention to you at all. I think she is more concerned about popping out those fake boobs at everyone. The parking isn't that great."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and met a friend that lived nearby here for a beer, with one of the main reasons being they had a Golden Tee machine. Well, they served beer (albeit a limited selection) and the machine worked (unlike the pinball machine next to it) so I guess it served its purpose? Nothing to write home about though, the outdoor patio seemed like it could be pretty cool to hang out and the dedicated cornhole space was a nice touch, but all in all, just a dive bar."}
{"text":"Came in after hiking Cholla Trail on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend and another couple. We were just looking for a place to grab a quick snack and some drinks and conversation. Not really expecting much but cold beer and hot food. The place was almost empty but that did not stop our waitress and the bartender from getting two of the four drinks wrong. This escalated when they managed to get three of the four meals wrong, the service was poor and after the fifth mistake in our order my friend finally complained about the bad service and continual mistakes and the waitress left and was replaced by a surly floor manager who was unprofessional, antagonistic, and confrontational. He did everything short of picking an actual fight with me. What started as a nice outing with friends turned into an ugly ordeal where I will never go back and am suggesting to all of my friends that they avoid the place as well. There are plenty of places where I can grab a bite to eat, a beer and not have some arrogant asshole of a floor manager come over and throw his machoness around to impress the female wait staff and bartenders at mine or friend's expense. Way to unimpress."}
{"text":"This place was quite lively, day or night.  Friends and I went here after a pre-season MLB Cubs baseball game at the nearby stadium.  Seems like the \"go-to\" place if you are from out of town."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday. Awesome patio. Very cheap Corona. Live original music. Service was very good, chips and salsa very good. Their queso dip is loaded and delicious. Only thing that was disappointing was their mahi and shrimp tacos.   Would definitely get drunk on the patio again but next time I will only eat chips, salsa, and queso."}
{"text":"Best carne asada street tacos, 2 bucks each? U kidding me, great atmosphere, music, service, good time"}
{"text":"Has anyone noticed that almost every Mexican joint in Phoenix claims to have won some award for their tacos. Someone needs to study this disturbing trend and clearly none of those awards could possibly be related to the taco Tuesday slop they are serving up to the customers. I did notice that a comedy night was also underway when I arrived and if you are ever thinking of attending (free) don't waste your time. It is clearly amateur night as bunch of people off the street are reading their routines right off the pad in front of the crowd. Oh, a heckler could have a field day here.    The bar at this place is pretty small and full of smokers which don't add much to anything. Maybe some bar will get some balls and just ban smoking totally. Doubt it, but why the hell not?     Ok, the tacos were not too good. The tex mex ground beef was luke warm, overloaded with lettuce and a semi-stale Ortega shell. The grease factor here was very high and the meat tasted of the Jack in the box variety. The $2 chicken taco has some good shredded chicken going for it, but everything else they threw in there didn't do it much justice and made it a watery mess of sour cream, tomato juice, bagged cheese and some chicken grease. Keep it simple should be the motto. I did like the corn hole arena, but this backyard needs to be renovated. They can make better use of the space in my opinion. Nobody greets you at the entrance, so you need to hope the servers find you when you seat yourself. Not that crowded on Tuesday, but other days, it could be a long wait."}
{"text":"THEY DO NOT HAVE NFL SUNDAY TICKET! Do not go there if you are looking to watch football. Otherwise, I really enjoy their food. I wish that I could get everything in one spot"}
{"text":"Have always liked this location, probably because it is never crowded and the tacos are also really good and cheap. You can score 2 tacos for three bucks here, either on corn (which are smaller) or flour (which have more meat). The staff is pretty cool here as well and one guy made us this great shot with fireball and Kahlua called a Cinnamon toast and we got a 2 for 1 deal. They also have plenty of TV's inside and a few outside bars on the patio. Pretty relaxed crowd and the only time I ever saw it packed was on New Year's. Chips and salsa are 1 buck, but that is probably going to normal soon in most places.  UPDATE: Tried a $10 Chicken Burro to go and this is a Great deal. The thing is loaded with chicken, beans and rice and it comes with more rice and beans and some quality guacamole. It was great to mop up the alcohol and also would be great anytime. They also raffle off a jersey on Monday night of both teams. It was my night."}
{"text":"I've been to all of the Dos Gringos locations in AZ, and all of them have the same problem: AWFUL service and garbage food. Otherwise, it's your typical obnoxious 20 somethings kinda bar that serves its purpose, to get drunks to hang out and order cheap bar food. God knows why or how this chain has lasted so long, it's really nothing that special and there are way better cantinas and mexican style dives to go to.  You can't expect too much from a little cantina that caters to 25 year old drunks, but you should expect a tiny bit of quality in service or at least edible food. The food is typical generic bar food that happens to have a few tomatoes and cheese passed off as mexican. The tacos are small and falling apart and are the same thing you'd find at a del taco, for 3 bucks more. The chicken wings are disgusting...DISGUSTING. Take a good wing, throw it on the street, let it get run over and dusty in the hot sun, then re-fry it and let it turn rock hard, and that's what dos gringos has for wings,  I kid you not. The absolute grossest and inedible bar food ever. If you come to this place you better only order hard alcohol, because the beer is gross and flat, I don't know how a bar can manage to screw up beer, but they sure did here. I never felt more cheated out of cash then when I spent it here on this stuff, I never ask for a refund, but if I did this would be the first time.  I used to get dragged here a lot years ago by drunk buddies, and honestly nothing has improved or changed since. When you arrive it will take at least 30 minutes to get a proper order going, the service is slow and ignorant of people. If you show up on a busy weekend night, you will wait forever, but the sad thing is if you show up on a slow night on a weeknight, you will still wait forever. The servers are all over the place, they don't seem to have sections or areas they just wander all over and pick people to wait on in no organized fashion. The last time I went here with people I had a server or bar-back whatever he was take a drink order and an ice water, after waiting 15 minutes, (and the bar was only like 50 feet away) he brings me my beer and a flat water in a tiny plastic cup and gives the party of young girls next to us tall plastic glasses with tons of ice and smiles. I guess he figured I wasn't a single 21 year old girl so I didn't matter. After that he vanished and 10 minutes later I got a girl server who was okay and made things fast enough. No complaints with her, she did her job, I just wish she showed up first and not the dude who already left a bad impression. He was some arrogant british dude with the puffed out chest attitude, he flirted with all the tables full of girls but could not give a c-r-a-p about anyone else, especially us guys.  I hate arrogant servers, bars or not, get your head out of your butt and grow up, cause guess what pal? good service=tips, bad service=no tips. Any good server knows that if you want to do well, you show a good attitude and be nice, don't treat people like they are lowly little peasants there to stare at the miracle that is you. FAIL. If that's your kind of attitude go work for abercrombie and fitch in a mall in scottsdale seriously.  What can you say? It's a dive bar for the young drunk people of chandler and scottsdale to hang out in, that's really all there is to it. It's a place your drunk buddies drag you to. If getting wasted on tequila or corona is your thing, then this place works, otherwise it's a hot, crumby little dive with nothing else around it and you'd be smart to go elsewhere like mill ave or downtown phoenix.  I'm a fair reviewer too, I don't give low grades for nothing...the service was slow, I sat around texting and waiting too long, I waited a total of 25 minutes to get 1 beer and an ice water, it took 2 servers to make that happen for my group, the food was absolutely stale, and that's it. I'm really surprised to see the 4 and 5 star reviews, these people must have written them while drunk, its the only way DG can get a 5 star.  I will never be dragged here or come here again, the last time was the last straw of many past straws. Yuck dude."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere at Dos Gringos. While they don't serve the best Mexican food I have ever had, the tacos are still very good, and I am a tough critic when it comes to tacos. I tried the gringos tacos and street tacos and actually liked the gringos tacos more. My boyfriend tried the chicken Diablo wrap and he loved it, especially with a little cholula."}
{"text":"This place has always been douchbag central in my eyes, the one by ASU anyway, but I came to this new location last night for a going away party, and was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of an ice house, but classier, with misters and food and a decent drink menu. They also play really fantastic music.. first 4 songs were all some of my favorite bands, including Passion Pit who came out of Boston, which was shocking.. and radical. Cant say Ive been to any other place that had such an impressive play list, and I am a bit of a music snob. Their nachos were enormous, and delightful, I ate every last bite, and then indulged myself in 2 more tacos after I had 3 more $2 Pacificos. Luckily for me my metabolism is amazing so I can do things like this, and I could have kept eating too because the tacos were delicious. I tried both chicken and steak, equally amazing. Our waitress was very patient, even though it was a table of 20 drunk ex co-workers of McFarlane Toys, which translates into 20 drunk super-nerds discussing comic books and video games.. She kept our drinks flowing and the food coming without missing a beat. I could tell she was overwhelmed, but nice work anyhow.. way to keep your cool. I did enjoy this place, but I am taking into account that it was Tuesday night, and really, no one else was in there.. so on a busy night this place could quite possibly suck, or be an exact replica of the Dos Gringos I used to know and had no problem forgetting.. either way, I had a good time, and I cant deny a place that has excellent music."}
{"text":"For my first time in old town scottsdale this was a cool spot.  Hung out up stairs on the patio area.  Prices were good.  Had I been able to really let loose and enjoy may have had a higher rating but live a distance.  Want to grab some food next time it looked good."}
{"text":"i'm not usually one to patron dos, especially on a crazy day like cinco de mayo, but after relocating to south tempe my options are severely limited on bars i can (or want) to ride my bike to. on a huge DUI enforcement night, bikes were in order and when i found out a brand new dos was opening here i couldn't argue.  it's what you've come to love about this trailer park/rocky point - inspired chain of bar/restaurants. i arrived at about 5 on 5/05 and it the patio was already packed. no cover, and no tables either. big patio and more inside seating at tables than usual. i understand this is supposed to be a more \"grown up\" dos, more family friendly with a more elaborate menu. it was certainly not family friendly on cinco! ha, i left the craziness at about 7 to watch the fight at a nearby club, and heard from a friend who worked that night that there were more than a few fights - including a girl getting jumped in the bathroom, but that's all heresay and conjecture at this point. good to see grown ups with families still know how to get out of control wasted on holidays and try to kill each other.   but seriously, i can't complain, i was treated very nice by the staff and managers because i had worked with them in the past, and they're more than cool and down to earth. only downside (aside from the basic bro element associated with all dos') is no designated bike locking area, but after seeing how many bikes were there that night, hopefully they'll get a set up."}
{"text":"Do you remember the mosh pit scene from the Lost Boys...Like that scene, this restaurant is anarchy personified. It is white trash skater/X-games charm at it's finest!   You must possess at least 5 tattoos and 3 body piercings to work there. When we arrived, I had to wait nearly 2 minutes because a bunch of ASU kids were engaging in some bean bag game right in the middle of the restaurant. I take that back, you could walked through it but those kids don't wait on anybody...pregnant...too bad....on a walker....you might just trip! Apparently these kids are  trying to toss bean bags into some wooden board with holes. Apparently when you are drunk and stoned, games like that are fun! Who knew? The fun doesn't stop there, there is also beer pong. I couldn't distinguish the servers from the patrons because they seem to hang out and chat too. When you ask for their help, it's almost as if they are upset that you interrupted their conversation while they were chatting with the guys playing beer pong.  The Patrons...well can we say men in their 40's who looks like they were just released from prison and ASU frat boys (the frat with less money). On weekends, expect to observe a fist fight or two but then again Dos is rather proud of that.  Okay so the food...now this is what is disappointing. The food is AMAZING. Seriously, 5 stars. It's fantastic. If this place didn't have the cast of Dazed and Confused settling here, I would go here more often. Even picking up food is a little scary. It's almost as if you receive a dirty look because you are sober. Where to start, the chimichangas and burritos are out of sight! The nachos are huge with quality chicken and plenty of excellent Guacamole.   It's a real tragedy because if the owners didn't call themselves the Two Whites guys and had a more \"boring environment\" and invited people who were not drunk or stoned to eat there, this place could actually make Diners Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network instead of Los Taquitos. The food here is certainly better. My advice, get the takeout and order it in the afternoon before the mosh pit starts at night. Wearing a couple of fake tatoos, eye liner and a wife beater might draw less attention too"}
{"text":"ekkk, umm maybe i was old town the wrong day. Service sucked but the place was big, maybe ill be back for someones birthday if they have a bar crawl here but by choice im not sure ill be back had to wait 30 mins to get a drink lol!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some tacos or cheese dip is awesome too. Have a large area available for outdoor seating. I see they host some paint nights too which is cool, but I haven't participated yet. I love that it's close to my home too. Servers have been great so far."}
{"text":"The new pizza shop was closed, so plan B was Dos Gringos. The service was great. I had no compliments. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Sign of trouble to come when we stepped out of the car onto a freshly used condom. Worst Mexican food we have ever had. Green chile  chimi was old dry dry dry pork...where was the green chile....complained and was told....that's the way we make it....really? Beans have no flavor and the street tacos are much better at Del Taco...Dirty tables,floors,bathrooms etc.. ....Never again"}
{"text":"Good thing 1 star is the lowest. No stars should be appropriate. Food was horrible. Carne asada fries had about 8 pieces of burnt meat on it the glasses were super dirty and the bathroom look like something from Saw 2. Please don't waste your money on this place....  oh and by the way the guacamole was $12 for a little bowl and chips."}
{"text":"If you want to sit on the patio at a meat-market, have we found the place.  if you are looking for good food with your beverage, it may not really be the place to go...  not horrible but nothing to go out of your way for.   It does have the \"beach vibe\" somewhat, but really there are much better places for this 40 yearold to go."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and it was nothing like the Dos Gringos on Priest.  You can tell the Manager at this location is lazy and doesn't really care about the location at all.  There were 4 dogs on the patio barking.  There were children running around with cell phones as their parents were drinking, and the service was crap.  Bad location.  Go to the one on Priest."}
{"text":"Bartender skipped through my song on the juke box because it was country. So rude!!!  We are paying customers and if you're going to offer touch tunes music you'd better be able to handle anything the customers will play."}
{"text":"Kaylie is AWESOME!!!!!! She did a great job with our orders. Everyone got what they ordered and got it quickly.   That being said... Management/bartender (some balding 6 foot plus gentlemen in a yellow shirt) showed up at 10:15 and asked us to leave. He had the new server, Kaylie, get over 20 people checks and HE DIDN'T HELP. He went behind the bar to help out all 4 people that were sitting there."}
{"text":"Margarita heaven!!! Plus great beautiful waitresses."}
{"text":"This is the place to be on Tuesdays for Tacos n Tequila Tuesdays. The tacos are CHEAP and AMAZING in flavor. Margaritas are only $3 and have a delightful kick. Someday- I will get around to trying other things on the menu-but you just can't beat their tacos! In the high heat of summer- you can sit on the patio and and still feel fairly comfortable. The have an assortment of over sized games, TVs, and occasionally DJs. A great place to meet up with friends. If you sit inside- sit near the bar and ask for Barry. He's the BEST \"Adult Babysitter\". He is everything you want in a bartender and server."}
{"text":"Nice patio with plenty of shade.  Waited on immediately.  Music is a bit loud for early afternoon.  Great waitress."}
{"text":"Great tacos, had both types.  Heaping goodness, very flavourful, nice bite.  Very relaxing atmosphere. OK for an afternoon cigar as well.  Service was great."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to sit out & have a few drinks with some chips and guacamole, but not a full meal. The food just isn't that good but the patio atmosphere definitely makes you want to drink. I had the Gringos Burrito and it was forgettable. Low quality rice without much flavor, mediocre red sauce, heavy refried beans, etc. I shared a cheese quesadilla with friends and it was also whatever. Barely any cheese so it was super thin, again forgettable. I'd definitely come back on a nice afternoon for beers & a snack, Dos Gringos does that wonderfully."}
{"text":"I am a big advocate of Dos Gringos actually but this Dos I cannot get into.  I loved the original Tempe location when it was on University, I used to go there all the time.  I love the Scottsdale location, but ever since they built this location a few years back, it's kind of like a pushover for me.  Yeah they serve the same booze, and food, and the decor is the same, but the vibe of this place isn't right.  Maybe because it's too big and they let too many riff raff's in, I really can't put my hand on it.  The only thing that really saves this place is the .50 cent coronas and well drinks on Thursday nights.  Shit I'm not even sure if they still do that anymore since it has been at least 8 months since I have been there and I don't feel as though I am missing out on anything.  I would never make plans to go here but if I was invited to go out there with a group of friends, I would just have to suck and up and go."}
{"text":"This Dos Gringos is definitely by far my favorite one of the several they have in the valley. Although it is in Scottsdale and I'm surrounded by Sdale douchebagery, I have always had a great time here. I don't care if I'm packed in here like a can of sardines, the sights make up for it if you know what I mean, he he. Whether it's day drinking or out at night. The food is actually really good, reasonably priced and great portions. There will be many more drunken adventures at this establishment for sure!!"}
{"text":"This Dos location is OK.  I mean I never have a bad time when I come here, but I never have an exceptional time.  Make the commute for the Scottsdale location.  That Dos is money!!"}
{"text":"If zero starts were an option that's what they would get. Worst service ever!!! It took at least 15 minutes to get our server's attention EACH TIME. Food was bland for Mexican food but reasonably priced but the service is SO BAD that I could never recommend this place or return."}
{"text":"The staff is unbelievably awesome, which is the only reason I go back. The drinks are overpriced and served in plastic  cups. I hope you like classic rock because that's all you'll hear during happy because they block the jukebox."}
{"text":"Dos has become the regular hangout for our group on Monday nights, for a few simple reasons:  1. $2 beers after 10pm 2. $4 meals/apps after 10pm 3. Atmosphere and service.  Dos Gringos is not the type of bar one would frequent because it's high class or offers a bevy of unique mixed drinks or beers on tap.  At its heart, it is a dive bar that excels at being kitschy and serving super cold bottled brews.  Its location takes advantage of Arizona's stellar weather, as it is an outdoor bar.  We've never gone during the day, but even during the warm summer evenings, the fans do their job at keeping everyone cool.    The servers here are always friendly, checking in frequently and serving up food and drinks quickly.  Our group tends to trickle in, and I'm always impressed at how easily the servers manage to keep everyone's tab separate without us requesting it, or needing to dissect what each person at the table ordered.  The reason for the three star rating lies primarily in selection.  For those looking for tequila or Mexican beers, Dos Gringos provides a great selection.  For those looking for something else, it may be a bit harder to select something from their drink menu.  This isn't inherently a bad thing; if I wanted a particular type of beer, I'd go to a different bar.  The music leaves a lot to be desired, though it is the standard bar mix of current popular songs (though they earn a point for not having played \"Party in the USA\" like every other bar I've been to over the last 2 months).  For Monday nights, Dos Gringos is the perfect scene for an ice cold Fat Tire and some nachos."}
{"text":"Beware. Went in on taco Tuesday and told the waitress we were there for the taco special. She brought us tiny street tacos. I had four and it was a poor excuse for a meal. The waitress was unappologetic saying it's the customers responsibility to know what they are ordering. I said... as the waitress... she should have asked if we wanted street tacos or crispy tacos. The \"manager\" (I doubt he was) said \"next time you'll know\". No next time. This was the first time and the last time buddy. It will be Filibertos on taco Tuesday for me. They are huge and flavorful and only $1.50."}
{"text":"I love Dos...I don't see how you can't. When its nice out this is where you will find me after a great morning by the pool..The steak tacos are great and the atmosphere is super chill! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is rarely a planned destination.  Usually, it's an accident.  Sometimes I have a lot of fun and sometimes I have a drink and leave.    I went there again this past weekend and again it was an unplanned stop.  My friend wanted to go next door to BS West and after some guy spilled a drink down my entire back, I decided to go over to Dos where at least I wasn't wasting my outfit on men who would rather critique it than rip it off (note: that sentence sounds way sluttier than I am, so don't get all excited).    It's almost my birthday, so the bartender made me some sort of shot in a plunger.  Classy all the way.  Also, there were a bunch of Slutty Santas to help give the place a festive feel.   Now, I am going to give you ladies a tip about Dos Gringos.  Don't expect to meet any quality men here.  For example, I met this hot Croatian guy on my last visit.  We had a lot of fun until I discovered his friend was actually his girlfriend.  Don't you just love it when guys refer to their girlfriends as just friends, but then the girlfriend reveals that they're dating and you stand there looking like an idiot and try to find a polite way to exit.  Well, I sure do.  What's up with that?  Talk about uncomfortable.    I am starting to become convinced that only guys who are looking to cheat on their girlfriends go to this bar... that or I only attract men with girlfriends.  Either way, please stop hitting on me taken and/or married men.  Thanks."}
{"text":"After trying to decide and attempting several places we ended up here cause it looked like it would be fun. Food was mediocre and service as well. it cost 76 dollars for two people. One pitcher of beer and two entrees. That is absurd! Would never go back."}
{"text":"Damn good food, great service! A bit warm though, but I can take it. I recommend this place. My wife says it's like a Mexican food Hooters."}
{"text":"I've been to this bar/restaurant many times and almost always have a good time. This time I went in for some lunch and a beer with some friends. It was New Years Day so there weren't many people there. The service was very good, and so were the prices, but the food wasn't very good at all. I had four of their $2 tacos and they were just too watery and didn't have much flavor. I'll go with something different next time."}
{"text":"So I go to this restaurant for lunch and ordered 4 tacos that was on the Happy hour menu. I received the tacos and asked could I have salsa for my tacos and when I received the bill they charged me for it. I left disappointed for a place that's suppose to be a Mexican cantina that should be standard it's like going to a burger place and being charged for ketchup and mustard that should be standard and free. I'm see restaurants get greedy and will lose business in the long run the food was not that great. They should have a salsa bar. If you want to be disappointed and be charged for everything even the chips and salsa then this is the place. I will not return. The manager even came outside as I was getting in my car to try to justify why they charge for salsa I sad that is ridiculous when you are a Mexican restaurant and need it to put on your food that should come with meal. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Come here expecting a bar with bar food, and you will not be disappointed. Don't come here and expect legit Mexican food. The queso tastes like what you'd buy at the store, and the chips were stale. The. Chips. Were. Stale. That's almost hard to do. The only reason I'm even giving two stars is because the outdoor area is cool, and they allow dogs."}
{"text":"Meh....its really cool looking for just drinks and a good time...I didn't like the food very much at all.  I had the street tacos and just wasn't too happy with the quality of the food...I don't know if it sat too long, or if thats just how it always is?  But the fish pieces were really good!  The service could be a little better, but overall its OK."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last Friday and had a lot of fun. The bartender that helped me, though he was a Jets fan, was super friendly and remembered  my order everytime I went back to get more drinks. The drinks were pretty cheap. I also ordered some tacos that were really good. They have a ton of televisions and a small dance floor, as well as a couple pool tables, a beer pong table, and a cornhole set. It was busy but I was able to move around and enjoy myself. I'd definitely come back here to grab a drink and play some pool or hang out."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is a must! Great food, people and atmosphere.  Yeah, you have to be a little patient... but their patio is so chill, you don't need super fast service. The Clamato guy is there a lot with some free samples of Micheladas, which by the way are fabulous!  Their chips and salsa are also wonderful."}
{"text":"Don't go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, you'll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap \"bar\" food... then you'll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!"}
{"text":"Stop in every once in a while.... food is always good. Street tacos!!!  Drinks are reasonable. Typical dos style. Great place to hang out with your friends if you don't want to mess up your place."}
{"text":"Love the music on Thurs and Sat :) Good deals on drinks! Quality time!"}
{"text":"This is the worst customer service I ever had. The bartenders and servers Ignorer the customers and you need to holler at them just to get something as simple as salsa or a fork or a plates they never ask you is everything OK is there anything you need .I don't know if they have a training policy but they have all failed for over a year. I keep trying to give them chances. No wonder the bar seems to be going under. Its never crowded or busy. And Izzy has the worst attitude of all he seems to hate his job and makes it very uncomfortable to ask him for something."}
{"text":"This place is just eh in my book. I did go in the middle of the day in the middle of the week (on vacation), so it was dead, so that didn't help the vibe. But the food just was not good. Really, no flavor in the tacos or queso. I just wouldn't recommend it or head back if I were back in the area."}
{"text":"How am I the duchess and haven't written a full review yet??? Dos Gringos is my total go-to for happy hours and nights out.  Mini chimis are absolutely delicious and frequent beer specials.  It's my #1 spot for day drinking, which they proudly advertise!  I've spent New Years Eve here two years in a row, my 30th birthday, AND even the start to my bachelorette party! As I said, it's one of my favorites in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos.  Girlfriend had mini chimis and I crushed the tacos.  We keep finding our way back.  The Carne Asada actually tasted marinated,  while slightly grilled.  The meat is always juicy and done medium. They brought the wrong order out first time around, gave us that order,  then brought out the correct order.  Bartender was cool.  Great time.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for bar food, and you get a lot.  We go during the day with our kid and avoid the crowds.  Kids eat free when you buy something for yourself & its not a problem if she runs around the dinning area a little (the actual bar is situated separately) Plenty of room so its not a bother to others.  we would also recommend going for happy hour,  we never go out anymore but we would if we had the time, energy, and a babysitter...  Love the gringo style street tacos.  Get the carne, they are worth the extra money.  I think they are much more tasty than the other options ( but all of the options are good)."}
{"text":"Not good, over priced and the food was nothing special, at all. We sat outside and there was a cockroach that was climbing on our table back. The Waitress said she has never seen that before. Did not offer anything to help the situation. Food was pretty cold when arrived. The chimichanga we ordered had very chewy meat in it. My corn tortilla for my tacos was soggy and I would think they knew to out 2 tortillas per taco for that reason...Never going back. Should have known better than to go to \"Mexican\" restaurant called 2 white guys."}
{"text":"I love the street tacos here!  I crave them constantly!  The queso dip is another must try!  It's a fun atmosphere always great service and good food."}
{"text":"The staff is bad and bar managers think they own that place. Would not recommend this place to hang out and drink. They treat their customers like crap."}
{"text":"Slow service, it was lunch time, huge restaurant, two servers??? I got the \"Monster taco\" it came in a fried flour shell and looked pretty impressive at first glance until I realized the bottom third of the taco was pinched shut with no filling at all. I got the carnitas and the filling was basically roasted pork with almost no spice or seasoning. The rice was pretty decent, the beans were straight out of a can and they'd doctored them with cayenne pepper? They were slightly spicy and not good at all. Anyway, great atmosphere, so if that's what you're looking for you'll like it. However, if it's about the food, give this place a pass."}
{"text":"Came to the Greenfield location on Cinco de Mayo for the LIVE BAND. Waited till 11:00pm. Paid $10 per person and NO LIVE BAND! When we asked the manager for our cover charge back he was RUDE! We just wanted to leave to go see a live band. We were denied our refund because according to the manager a drummer playing with the DJ is considered a live band! Cover charge is now $20 SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE, THE DJ ISN'T THAT GOOD EITHER."}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab delicious food and cold beers after Spring Training games. Such a fun place with lots to do."}
{"text":"This is the place you come to when you are already drunk and looking to just have some weird wild fun. I came here with my friends after we had been partying for a bit and we were looking to continue our fun. The drinks were strong, the music was blasting, and the people were weird (a man in a care bear unicorn outfit?). I don't think I would eat here but I would come back to drink, dance, and be merry."}
{"text":"Anytime I can sit outside, eat street tacos, and enjoy myself, I am happy.  (especially when I am just a few miles from home).  I do like their taco tuesdays, and they have a nice selection of beverages.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just need a drink.  Like when it's a Tuesday.  I mean come on, I put a good 2 days worth of work in, it's time to relax.    We headed over to Dos for Happy hour, and I was thrilled to find killer specials. $2.00 Pacificos and margaritas really hit the spot.  We sat at the bar, and it was clear our bartender was a real pro.  She remembered that I didn't like the lime in the beer, and seemed to know many of the other patrons by name.  We took advantage of the happy hour food prices as well, and I got the quesidilla, with steak.  It was delicious and melty and cheesy, all the things it should be.  Sadly, I was so stuffed from that that I couldn't try the amazingly loaded Rocky Point Nachos or the tasty looking queso dip my friends got.    Great value, great service and a good atmosphere, this Dos Gringos is a happy hour must."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos- Yo tengo Uno mano, dos cervezas, tres chicas y nunca tengo inabicciones. thats what its like here on a good night. on a bad night take out tres chicas and please insert tres numeros de telefonos de una servicia de sluts. Its actually a great place with the best deals around and a spot to watch the game and according to the sign, its also an offical border crossing."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! Other than the great drink specials and the awesome staff, there are games to play like adult-sized Jenga! Hopscotch! And there is a free comedy show every Tuesday. Cant go wrong with this place is loud music, fun people and great drinks are your goals."}
{"text":"Didn't come here to eat just drink but can't really go wrong with 2.50 coronas this is definitely is a college bar and a bit noisy what's wierd is there Oregon duck fans and not ASU fans? Great place for day drinking though"}
{"text":"This is basically a happy hour bar, and quite a good one. Cheerful; service & reasonable prices, with an open air atmosphere. Mexican style food - we had nachos & a fish taco & both were just fine. Pacifico bottles were $2 each. Not bad."}
{"text":"I wondered when they opened this place how it would do right next to Iguana Macks, or if Iguana's would suffer.  Both seem to do just fine.  We came here on a Friday night after pre-gamming at a friends house.  Even with full bar, the service was fast and friendly.  The whole crowd seemed to be pretty friendly and relaxed, which was great because a few of my friends were a little drunk!  The Jukebox seems to have a master control - they will turn off music they don't like and skip to a new song, so unless you are spending your money on mainstream hits, don't bother.  Not sure how much money my brother spent before he gave up.  My favorite feature of all Dos Gringos is the painted footsteps you follow to the bathroom.  Amazing how helpful that is after a few (many) beers."}
{"text":"This place is good for happy hour or day drinking during the week.  I can't say that I would go on the weekend because it just isn't my crowd. It tends to cater to the young and hip crowd who think that a drink called \"The Donkey Punch\" is hilarious in its irony.  The food is ok, the drink specials are pretty good and the fact that it is mostly outdoors is awesome 8 months out of the year.  It is a fun place to go for a work happy hour."}
{"text":"The Guac and Chips are the best, I prefer the location off of Alma School as they did better on the usual meals we order and service"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go on a Thursday, not so great on a Tuesday.  We were one of 2 groups on the patio.  Our waitress came by once and we didn't need anything, so that must have meant we didn't need anything for the next 45 minutes.  She came back to check on the other group and seemed to make a point not to make eye contact with us as she disappeared.  The next time she paid attention to us was when we chased her down to close our tabs."}
{"text":"Great place for Taco Tuesday with friends. I wish that there was a better selection for drinks.  For happy hour, everything is reasonably priced. Outside patio is inviting and cozy. Atmosphere is very casual."}
{"text":"Street Tacos are good, Happy Hour Corona's for $2.50, great for Happy Hour or a laid back evening. Nothing like the Dos in Scottsdale, but if you're feeling in the mood for steak nachos and a beer with no fuss, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Went here because my husband and I were starving and we love Mexican food. We grabbed a table inside since it was seat yourself and less smokie.. talk about a turn off I hate eating around smokers. But then we waited 10 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us.. it looked like there were only two around .. took forever for our food too. And then once we got it BOY was it greasy! Nope not okay.. I don't mind some grease but I literally couldn't even finish my tacos.. they weren't even appetizing. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"College hottie servers and spring break in Mexico atmosphere.  I am sure this place starts jumping well after I have left.  Looks like every bar did in every college town in the late 80s and 90s."}
{"text":"I love this spot. One of my favorites for years. They recently made some changes to the menu and everything was fantastic. I've never gone to this location for the food but I do now. Loved everything. The carne asada street tacos were unique and some of the best I've had.  This is also by far the best day drinking chill spot I've found. I never have a bad time here  Only reason to not get five stars is I think their struggling a bit with the staff. There seems to be a high turnover and usually only 1 person during the week tending bar and waiting tables. Makes for slow service.  We've noticed it's gotten a lot slower overall in there lately. Really hope it comes back around for them. It's a great spot."}
{"text":"Love this place been her twice now from San Diego can bring my dog during the day. Food is great even though I am from the home of Carne Asada!! It is miserable during the summer but that is just cuase I am not used to the heat.  Service has always been wonderful. Loved the fried chimichanga.  Will be going here when I visit my brother again!!! Loved the Gringos!"}
{"text":"The nachos were really good but our server charged us $2 for sour cream without notifying us it was extra. The nachos were also overpriced. $13? Come during happy hour or find your nachos elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!!! Overcharges like no other and won't give you itemized receipts. Don't effing go here. They lie about when   you cash out and sign for your receipts and over charge a lot. Between two trips here within three days I got cheated out of $20 from improper receipts and bills. This place is NOT the cheap place to drink in Scottsdale. EFF THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of people when we came! It was lively and everyone was playing games. I ordered a entree and then salsa and chips for an appetizer.   They brought all the food out together, and got our order wrong, BUT the alcohol service was fast. The tacos were flavorful, but the chips were over done and tasted stale. The salsa looks like it almost tipped over in the basket.   It was ok but not amazing   *edit: despite the kinda crappy service, the tacos were the bomb.com"}
{"text":"This place has been doing it right for a very long time. Back in the day, there were only 3 bar stools inside, and a waiter in town could trade thier \"This is not a check\" paycheck for a cold beer. The tacos are killer and that hot sauce is freakin' nuts. Love it."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out. They had some awesome painting /drinking event going on in the back . They also have corn hole . The nachos were very good t, I highly recommend them  ."}
{"text":"I will never forget my 18th Birthday.  Even though it was over three years ago, I can remember it down to what I was wearing.  Not by how good it was, but by my experience at Dos Gringos.  I have no problems with the servers or the decor.  It was actually quite nice.  My problem was with the food.  I ordered a Carne Burrito with Red Sauce, which is something that I usually get when I am at an authentic mexican restaurant.  From the first bite, I knew that something was amiss.  The first complaint that I have was that the meat was raw.  Not Rare, Not Pink, but Full-on red.  I did not find this out until I was halfway done with the burrito; I thought that all the red juice was from the red sauce that I had ordered... I was wrong.  After asking for it to be recooked, they brought me back a new burrito.  Skeptical, I cut inside, just to take a look... Lo and Behold, more uncooked meat.  Now, at this point, I remember getting queasy.  Not only did I have food poisoning, but I was deeply sick from the raw meat that I had previously eaten.  Needless to say, I found myself in their restroom for an extended period of time.  I have not gone back since.  Some people that I Know believe that I would have a different experience if I returned, but that is not a chance that I will take.  Dos Gringos?  More like Don't Go-go."}
{"text":"Ate there today, 3/8/15. Food came cold. Sent it back. Waited a long time. The salads and mini tacos were nothing great. The green chili is green enchilada sauce with something else green. Very unremarkable . The drinks were avetage. Check came ...we were charged doible. The waiter corrected the bill. Music was loud and obnoxious. We are in our 60s. But still. We wont be returning."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Food was excellent as was the service.  Nice outdoor location.  Will definitely go back again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Didn't really care for this place. People there were lame. Not a big menu selection."}
{"text":"I've had pretty mixed experiences at Dos Gringos... on the one hand, their drinks are always stiff and cheap, which is a big win in my book. On the other, the place is always empty, and if you're ordering food, the service in the kitchen is severely lacking. The place is so big that without a lot of patrons, it feels like you need to bring a group to have any fun. If you're just one or two people looking to hang out with new folks, you're going to find yourself sitting alone at the bar.  When you can get food, it's actually pretty good. The pork chile nachos are my favorite, so you can imagine how sad I was staring at them, from my table, sitting in the kitchen window for 10 minutes before they were finally brought to my table last night! When it comes to Mexican food, there are a lot of great places in Phoenix, and honestly, I just don't see waiting that long to be served in a place with very few customers when there are so many other options... (For the record, I also watched other food sit in the window for similar amounts of time. I have been a waitress before, and I understand it being hard to run food when the place is slammed, but it was pretty empty, and there were idle servers.)  Bottom line: If you're going with a big group for drinks, it's a good place. If you're going for food or with just a few people, don't expect it to be packed, fast or much of a party."}
{"text":"Oh, classic Dos. I've been to Dos 100 times, this was the first time I've ever eaten here. Had a taco plate with 5 chicken/chorizo tacos......FREEKIN BOMB!!!!!  Nice atmosphere for a Sunday afternoon, country music playing thru the speakers, pretty mellow crowd. One waitress it seemed like, but she rocked!!    I'm still a fan!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed here and it's always a fun place to hang out. The food(tacos) are awesome. My favorite is the street style chicken tacos. The breakfast burrito is also awesome and BIG.   $2.50 coronas until 7 are the right price too. When the weather is a tad cooler it's fantastic to sit at the bar and soak up the sun.  The bar tenders are always on top of the drinks and even give a little entertainment. Granted I have been there primarily before 5-6pm.  Oh and the giant games they have are hilarious to play with after a few shots ;)"}
{"text":"A resounding \"Meh\" .... slow service and barely warm food....  place was pretty empty (not a good sign for a Saturday night) ....   chips and salsa didn't arrive until after we got our meals (which were barely warm)... server did comp the drinks since the chips were late...   still, can't say we'll be back...."}
{"text":"A big fan of strong margaritas, tasty fresh guacamole, and the fantastic patio. A Lovely surprise for this native Oregon girl was the Ducks table:)! The inside is a bit club ish for me, but the fab patio more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"What can you say about DOS?  I've been here a dozen times. If you know.......you know. Drinks in an open aired bar, good music and fun times. This was stop #2 on Sunday Funday for us. Bloody Mary bar?......YES.  Tons of stuff.......yes STUFF to put in your bloody mary. Loved it. After an hour in of watching everyone get plowed at noon. (you know.......yeah you know) We ordered some pretty bomb ass nachos that hit the spot.  Other than that, you know this place is just nuts on the weekend nights. I think when we all hear the name Dos gringo's we all have that same drunken memory from this place.  We all do that same nod. \"Oh yeah, that one night at Dos\" I know I've spent many birthday's here and other peoples birthdays and have participated in Bar Olympics.......good times DOS!!!"}
{"text":"Went fairly early on a Friday night. It was starting to get busy and waitress said they were short staffed...everyone looked of average height to me though (insert knee slap here). Anyways... Got chips and salsa for $1 and some Gringo chicken tacos and some flautas. All had that satisfying grease flavor that washed down well with beers. Waitress was nice and stopped by a couple times. Good night. Oh yea, they had a corn hole game going on the patio too."}
{"text":"One complaint on behalf of my friend. The manager Chris accused my friend of not paying her tab the previous wknd in front of people. When she showed him the bank statement PROVING she had, she recieved no apology. Not classy Chris. Not classy."}
{"text":"We've gone to Dos a dozen or so times over the last couple of years and the place just keeps getting worse. Service is incredibly slow with us waiting with empty drinks for long periods of time as we try to find our waitress. The last two times we were there (both on a Tuesday evening), we ended up leaving after 20 minutes because the 5 servers that passed our table never stopped to take orders, or even make eye contact. The only time we've been able to be served in a timely manner is if we're sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"For a place like this the bar is low but they came in even lower than that obnoxious drunk fools and a server who does not give a sh@t I had to go get her for food and drinks I'm out on this"}
{"text":"$4 Corona on a Sunday night?  This did not even feel like the same bar as the 8th St location by ASU campus.  Nothing but d-bags and ladies playing dress-up.  One beer and out."}
{"text":"I love this place, we love Lindsay! I would only recommend the bar to section off a smoking section. NON smokers like patio seating too!  #nonsmokinglivesmatter"}
{"text":"Very nice, comfortable with good pricing! Good food with many options on the menu. The music was very entertaining and staff was very nice. Will definitely go there again in the near future."}
{"text":"Some of my girlfriends like to meet here for hh. This was my third time here, we always sit outside... thank goodness. I went to the restroom after we'd already eaten. Seriously, I thought I was in Tijuana when I went inside. I've never seen a more disgustingly dirty bathroom this side of the border. The managers of this place should be reprimanded. It's so nasty, then you pass the kitchen and cringe and try not to look because you know it's going to make you want to vomit. I just can't even. There's no excuse. I don't want to look at the health code report because I'm pretty sure they don't even have a \"C\" in the window.  Service was good... and bottled much ultra you can't mess up. Review update! I did check the records and it looks like they have a clean kitchen thank goodness!! http://www.maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/OnlineApplication/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodSearchInspection?p=FD-14694&i=0"}
{"text":"I love Dos Gringos! Its my favorite place to grab a beer and do body shots at (kidding....kinda)! Super casual, super fun, and super chill. Woo is amazing behind the bar and security does their job well. The deep fried taco is delicious, but what isn't delicious when deep fried? I've only really experienced Dos at night, but the few times I've enjoyed an adult beverage during the day has been fantastic as well.  They have a DJ on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights spinning dance tunes for the small, but lively \"dance floor\" area. There is an upstairs, but most of the fun is downstairs so I rarely venture up there.  I'm happy the weather is cooling down cause I really enjoy sitting on the patio without my balls sweating off. Also, they have a giant Jenga available all day and night long while the bean toss is available during the evening but put away when the night approaches. Good times at Dos, woot woot!"}
{"text":"I go to Spring Training every year and one night is always a Dos Gringos night. Always a good time. It's always packed and has a good vibe usually. Sure it's a fairly generic cantina-style establishment but as long as the drinks are served quickly so I can stay hammered it's all good in my book."}
{"text":"Best part about Dos is it's cheap.   Want to get drunk, have a good time, and not have to worry about prissy people? Dos is your place.  Service always seems ok, I never really have to hunt anyone down for a drink if I'm sitting at a table. I usually get the nachos with beef, they are awesome!! The mini chimis are good too but definitely try the nachos.  By far the best place to sit back and people watch. It's like a super entertaining zoo there.   Dos will always have a place in my heart and it's definitely my go-to bar."}
{"text":"The food was really good, and the outdoor patio was nice. The service was however not the best. We rarely saw our waitress until the end to get the check I think her name was Ashley. Also the DJ was... there. I call him DJ drinks alot, because all I saw was him sipping on his drink the whole night."}
{"text":"I love drinking here, but the service is always God awful. Seems like each time I go, the waitress is complaining about something in her life, or how busy her night is, or some garbage. Just shush at get my drink. Food is good, drinks are good, please work on the service! Also, place needs a good scrubbing. I feel like I'll get an STD from if I touch something in the bathroom.  Prices are kind of high for what you get."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to drink when I have nothing better to do. Friendly staff, good service, beer selection is just okay. The game area is fun on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I love drinking here, but the food is mediocre. Prices are good though. Need to clean the tables better too."}
{"text":"Ok The food here, its freakin' good.  Really good.  Like, no joke.    And from seeing this place, you wouldn't think it.  But their food, really is impressive.  And cheap.  Try their mini chimichangas... or their supergooeycheeseychimi (which is basically a beef chimichanga topped with tons of cheese and cream cheese and more cheese)  Their drinks are good and average  Good place for happy hour, or drinking during the day."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 8 on Sunday 03-25-2012.  ( We had been going to Iguana Mack's actually, but it was closed for renovations, so we went next door to Dos Gringos. )  The place is really nicely decorated and \"fun\" from a setup point of view.  Welded Mexican statues, Christmas lights strung around, etc.  They put an effort into decorations that's for sure.  We sat in an area that was covered patio (sorta) and the wind was blowing and the clouds were blocking the sun.  The patio experience was really pretty awesome - one of the best I've had in the Valley after moving here in 1995.  They were short-staffed, and a bartender was our waiter. (sigh)  This can be good or bad, and I guess he did OK considering he was covering about 8 people at the bar too.  Took F.O.R.E.V.E.R. for the food to get to us.  I mean, like 45 minutes or maybe a tad longer.  A couple of times, we ran out of soda/water/beer and had to wait a while for him to notice.  When the food FINALLY arrived, there were instant problems.  The beans had a \"hard coating\" over the top, an indication that they sat under a heat lamp for a WHILE.  All the food was at best barely warm, and most of it was virtually cold.  One order was wrong, so it got taken back and replaced.  (At least ONE of us got hot food !! )  We ate without complaint at that point because we were starving.  So, with all these problems, \"why 4 stars?\" you might ask me.  Read on:  When it came time for the bill, we told the waiter/bartender about the problems and he sent the manager, Jim, over to talk to us.  We nicely explained the issue, mentioned that we did enjoy most of the flavor of the food, but that most of it was cold and obviously had sat there ready to bring out to us for a very LONG time.  He said he'd take \"some stuff off\" then returned with a bill for.... .......... ........ ...... .... wait for it.... .... ...... ........ .......... a grand total of $5.50.  That's \"Five Dollars and Fifty Cents.\"  He only charged us for the two beers.  All the food was comped.  Eight people got free food.  Now THAT, other restaurant managers, is the way to achieve \"future customer loyalty\" right there.  We are going to tell EVERYONE about the good treatment we received and the correct way the manger handled it.  We would have been happy with him taking 2 or three of the dishes off there, but to give us ALL the food for free?  Excellent public relations move.  We will be back to eat there again.  Multiple times.  Hopefully on days when they are fully staffed !!!"}
{"text":"I wish this place wasn't in Scottsdale (i.e. I wish this place wasn't full of cougars and 19 year old girls dressed in couture at a sticky cancuny bar in AZ).   So yes, this place definitely wants to be a low-key version of Senor Frogs here in the Valley. And ya know what, I'm ok with that. I'm all about a good margarita and authentic mex food...but let's face it, not everyone is good and not everyone is authentic. But if you have an outdoor bar and a tiki feel...at least you can make a lot of people happy.  So I was here on this bar crawl thing which made me a little bit ashamed...I just was too sober to disregard the fact that my group was full of those people in that bar. But despite the crowd and the LAME dj...the ambience and set-up here is superb. Now if we could just get something akin to that in Central Phoenix...with a day drink, laid-back scene that doesn't scream I wish I was still 23 and ooo by the way did you see my new Prada?"}
{"text":"I think the name means only two people should eat here...and it ain't this two!  Had the monster taco and tried two bites.  The shredded beef was cold to lukewarm....and completely unappetizing.  The rice was spicy but tasteless.  Don't even ask me about the beans.  One bite and I gave up my whole plate to the waitress who asked me if I wanted something else.  I politely said, \"no thank you.\"  Never been here before.  Never will be here again."}
{"text":"Eat and drink they have it all ... Well let's just say our tacos were pretty darn good I love spice and yep they hit the spot...  had the Juan famous tacos shredded chicken and chorizo  comes with a spicy jalapeño cream salsa and we order the habanero cream salsa also and let me tell you it was really good if you love spice with great flavor. They do have other thing on the menu that aren't spicy I asked for what was the spices thing that was good..  Nice fun atmosphere really makes you feel like you were in Mexico. they have corn Hole ,  4 foot connect four and beer pong. So in my opinion a good place to eat and drink just a fun all around place.."}
{"text":"I clicked 1 star at first, but I think that'd be a bit harsh.  Atmosphere - Unless you like the ORE Ducks, you might at well go somewhere else anytime there is a game going on.  It's hot, sticky, you can't feel the fans, dirty and a little crazy.  I usually like \"crap holes\" but this was a little bit beyond what I normally dig.  Food - crap.  Not worth it.  There wasn't one thing that anyone at our table ate that I enjoyed putting in my mouth.  The \"fru-fru\" drinks that the ladies got, filled with sugar and one was even returned because it tasted like the wash rag from the bar (yes, I've tasted that before).  The Nacho's for a place called \"Dos Gringos\" were some of the worst Nacho's I've tasted.  No cheese, and the few bits of cheese on it, weren't melted.  It was like they took warm chips and hoped for the best.  Service - even worse crap.  I'm normally very giving of servers as I was one in a different part of my life, but no one who worked there even wanted to be there.  We had one dude take our order, another girl ask us for drinks, one who dilivered our drinks (then tried to sell us UV Blue shots...really? am I 17?) and had some kid who didn't speak English bring our food.  Oh, refills? don't count on it....thought that UV Blue shot girl came around quite often.  Advice: find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love this Mexican place! The street tacos are awesome! The entrance is through the patio. Nice sized patio with misters to keep it cool. You then enter into an outdoor space that is covered before entering into the actual building. Everything is decorated like old Mexico, bright colors and they also have a tv over their large fire place. The menu is easy to read and servers make great suggestions if you are uncertain. They have cornhole, big jenga and pool tables in the building part. You can come with your kids during they day and they will be entertained! The margaritas are tasty and they offer several different types of margs. A definite cheap lunch spot."}
{"text":"Dos is our favorite spot. All the staff are awesome as is their food. They have great happy hour deals. I really like the Bloody Mary's and the breakfast burrito on Sundays.   Dos Gringos rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Unless you hit this spot for happy hour, my opinion is that the bottled beers are pretty expensive. Furthermore, I feel like this place could use more beers on draft. The location and the casual, outdoor atmosphere make this a cute lil drinkin hole, but I can think of a few more places that I would choose on a regular basis because of my two above complaints- expensive BOTTLED beer and basically 0 selection in draft beer."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! The margaritas are tasty and the monter tacos are great!"}
{"text":"All of the dos gringos are about the same, unique atmosphere but food isnt that great and only beer on special is pacifica. Does have some games like bean bag toss so its an decent place to hang out in the late evenings but I never eat there anymore."}
{"text":"Everybody likes Dos.  I've found its the first place anyone from out of town is taken because its the prefect entry level Scottsdale bar.  While you'll find some really good looking people really dressed up, for the most part, this is one of Old Town's more laid back nighttime hangouts.  Imported friends arent scared off by pretentious club-goers, instead they are welcomed with obnoxious open arms and peanut shells on the floor.    Drinks are cheap (Coronas are always just $2, mixed drinks are $6 and up) and the food is tolerable when you're a bit buzzed up.  Bar Mexican food is always a nice finale to 12 or so margaritas, thats what I always say.  Dos is known as a \"great place to day drink\" and it is that too.  Grab a stool on the patio and youre sure to make friends with someone, the gringos here are all pretty friendly.    The \"dance floor\" (search your way through the crowd to the upstairs back balcony to find it...its small) is always packed at night, and the music aims to please.    Day or night, local or foreign, everyone seems to have a good time at Dos Gringos."}
{"text":"This is a place I can always come back to if I'm not in the mood to really do anything much at all. I like it much better when it's not packed like it is over the weekends. this is more of a middle of the week bar for me. It's nice because the venue is open and parts are outside exposed. There is a bartender there that always makes the ideal margarita for me so I cannot complain."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed this Dos Gringos location! Great service and the trio combo of gringo rolls, chicken enchiladas, and beef tacos was just right! Thanks Savannah!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this does not even come close. If you are going to hang out with a group it is okay. There are so many other nice places.   If you are going for food you will be very disappointed. The name says it all!!!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and feel of this place. I love being able to bring my dog to the nice patio they have available. However, there service is probably the worst I have ever seen! We have gone there multiple times and the service can either be OK or the worst I have ever seen! It takes about 20 mins to order something on average and the waiter or waitress never checks up on you. Then, getting the bill is awful as well! It is like they forget about you! Honestly, I wouldn't go here except for it being close to my house and the environment being very relaxing."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter. We missed lunch while we were out car shopping...so we had a linner! Lunch/dinner.  My first question to the waitress....do you have any IPAS. They did have Lugunitas IPA,  good start. We each ordered Carne Asada  street tacos....we were so hungry I was down to the last bite on my 2nd taco and realized I didn't take a picture....we ordered another round of crispy tacos with ground beef. Once again so hungry I forgot to take pictures.....uhh   The tacos here are really good. We got chips and salsa and they were good too, salsa was a little mild it could be taken up a notch.  We ate on the patio and they are dog friendly. The place is clean no issues there. We had a really good waitress and she took really good care of us and I didn't catch her name.   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Just sat at the bar for 20 minutes waiting for service while the bartenders talked to eachother. Headed to another bar now. Definitely won't try that again"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS dead! The fullest I've ever seen it is every seat at the bar (roughly 20 seats) plus maybe a couple tables. The only reason I'm willing to come here is because I have stupid friends that like this place. The only positive is their \"Street Tacos\" that I like... Which are cheap.  Overall, this place is at the bottom of the fun list... If you get pulled here, get their \"Street Tacos!\""}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, this place reminds me of PB Bar & Grill.  It has a festive atmosphere that makes a good backdrop for a happy gathering.  The food was way better than I expected from a place called Dos Gringos.  We ordered the mini-chimis & their award winning tacos.  We did have to speak up to remind the server about our order, but the server was really busy.  I didn't mind it at all.  I drank in the mean time and I have to say the drinks were pretty good too.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"When I first moved here I thought this was good Mexican food.  Shows how much I knew.  Seems like a good place to drink, but you are best off leaving the menu on the table.  The food is really bland, salsa is not great either."}
{"text":"This place is very tiny. Most people stand outside and there is no space. If you try to sit at a table you gave to play Musical chairs or fight through people.  To each his own I guess."}
{"text":"The place for popped collars,  pink shirts and bad attitudes. Not sure why all of them populate here but they sure do feel entitled to their space and existence.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Ordered pick and got the combo and they forgot my rice and beans  shoulda checked the box before I left...other than that it's delicious as always"}
{"text":"Ok we had the street tacos here and the chips and cold beer and they were good but not too filling"}
{"text":"They pour great drinks and tons of bar options . Street tacos like being in Mexico. Definately aa kepper if you're not looking for fancy but want a good time. Definately recommended."}
{"text":"I give it a star for food. I just moved close to this bar and have been here a few times now. The lunch service is good. The night service is a joke!! Where do they find these miserable bartenders who do not give a shit whether you are at their bar or not.  They all have constant frowns on their faces and wait for you to wave them down to get a drink. Even when they are slow. I am in the industry....wow this place needs a management/bartender revamp!!!  Sad because the place has potential.      Much better service today. Bartender still likes to stand at service well talking with the waitresses instead of interacting with customers. But at least i wasn't ignored today. They get a few extra stars this time."}
{"text":"Our fantasy football team has done our draft here for the past few years and it's been a great location.  The Bloody Mary bar is one reason that we keep coming back. Although I'm not a fan of the Bloody Mary myself, Dos Gringos offers a glass of vodka and then you get to choose your own adventure. The guys get pretty ridiculous with their concoctions, but like to go back for more. Their food is great, too.  I've eaten everything from street tacos, to breakfast burritos, to salads and always enjoy their food. In many places, I get stuck in a rut and always order the same thing. Dos Gringos brings out the adventurous foodie in me where I like to try different items and never disappoint. Yes, it can be loud, but it's a bar. If you're looking for a quiet spot for a first date, go somewhere else. If your looking for a place to hang out with friends which offers a great selection of food and drinks, look no further."}
{"text":"Not much to look at, but tacos were authentic and the margaritas were strong. What could you want from a Mexican place. I felt like you we're really in Mexico. Don't miss for cheap but good taste of the real thing."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with friends. Prices on beers went up since last visit. Place is mainly all outdoor seating, to hot and humid to be comfortable. Owners need to put some $ into place. Real dump. Good for kids just looking to get hammered. Food mostly fried, even Tacos were deep fried in shell, like jack in the box! Nachos were decent. Staff needed some training . Definitely not a place to go for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Review for happy hour....I was surprised I liked this place as much as I did.  Maybe it was the margaritas talking as they were tasty and I think only $3.    We were in a group of 12 people and of course all of us wanted separate checks.  I always feel awkward when asking for a separate check but when asked, our server did not blink and was really nice the entire 3 hours that we were there. I think the request is common as it is a place that seems to cater to large parties.    The place is loud, filled with tacky decorations, tables and chairs that wobble, but I would recommend if you are in the mood to meet a group of friends for  drinks and socializing."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be writing a food review of Dos Gringos. The spot, with four Valley locations, is known more for being a raucous bar in my circles than a dining destination, yet after I ate lunch at the Chandler location recently, I was very impressed with the food the spot offered.   First off, the portions are massive and are a great deal for the price you pay, since entrees were only around $10-$12 apiece.  I splurged on the deep fried bean and cheese chimichanga smothered in jalapeno cream cheese and sour cream. The burrito was absolutely massive and was served with rice and beans. After chowing down on a generous serving of chips and salsa, it really stuffed me.  My friend got cheese enchiladas, and her meal was also huge. It wasn't gourmet Mexican food or anything, but it sure was delicious.  I had never considered Dos Gringos as a spot I'd go out of my way to eat at, but after that experience, I'd recommend it to people looking for some good food during their happy hour-or as a place that has awesome food to soak up some of that alcohol you've been drinking, since the kitchen is open until last call."}
{"text":"Dos is a great bar to visit after a spring training game or a day of drinking. It has plenty of outdoor areas to hang out, giant jenga, air hockey, drink specials and in the heart of Old Town. It's just a generic dive bar and one that's worth the visit if you've been drinking, it's a random hour of the day and you want to continue drinking. The food's mediocre bar food and decent food to dine on while taking in a few drinks. And with at least four different bars, you'll rarely have to wait in line for a drink. So next time you find yourself drinking when the sun's still out...remember Dos as an option."}
{"text":"Dos is a Great place to enjoy dancing, games, & great food. The only problem is the smoking areas! We always have a wonderful time but the reason we Rarely return is the fact that smoking is ALLOWED. We had the Best seats tonight, cinco de mayo, yet the fact that smoking was Allowed......... We all had headaches & we were Extremely uncomfortable so we had to leave. We love you Dos but please get rid of the smoking!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and margaritas are really good and very cheap. In terms of seating, you can choose a lots of sun or cool shade. Service used to be pretty bad (servers acted annoyed by kids), but it's much better now.  I bring all of my visitors here."}
{"text":"Even when there aren't many people here, I still end up having fun. It is close to my apartment so a quick go-to but would come even if it wasn't. Staff is attentive and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We started off with the mini Jimmie's which I could've eaten about six more platters of. Went with the monster taco and the Carnitas tacos. Very impressed with the atmosphere. Will definitely come back and tell others to try."}
{"text":"I like it..... It reminds me of Sharkeez back in Cali.  I even like it better when it's a 10 dollar cover, then .50 cent drinks.  I like it the bestest though because of the great looking girls that seem to frolic here past 11pm.  I'm sure you'll like too."}
{"text":"our final stop on a pub ride, dos never disappoints for drankin. it was early, so there weren't many people (which is fine with me, as i was already half drunk, and i'm that douchbag who gets a little cocky when he drinks too much and thinks he's George St. Pierre, and then gets punched in the face for oogling some girls big boobs while her much bigger boyfriend is fuming at me).   the doormen welcomed us in and even gave us a friendly good night when we left. the bartender was all smiles and pleasant, and with so few people there, drinks were in our hands within seconds.   this place has always been fun, and of course, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Baja shrimp tacos- Mexican street style are the way to go! Came here mid-day after driving around on the trolley. This place really is great for day drinking - $4 Bloody Maries, $7 margaritas and super cheap tacos. Fun atmosphere with great outdoor people watching, what else do you need!"}
{"text":"I have been to DG once before and had a great experience - good food, good drinks and great atmosphere. This past Saturday, I was in Scottsdale again and wanted to bring my group there. I called a couple of days before and made reservation since there were 8 of us in our group. When we arrived, they said go to the bar so I told the bartender we had a reservation for 8. He looks at me and says  \"Why the f*** would you make a reservation here?\"  A little shocked, I replied were there are 8 of us. His response was \"thats idiotic, no one makes reservations here and just laughs.  Needless to say, I was a little taken aback by his response and got a very bad feeling from this place. He asked what I wanted to drink and I walked away. I had no intention of bringing 8 people to eat and drink at a place that treats their customers with such disrespect. The security guards asked why were were leaving and when I explained they didnt know who the bartender was, only that they were sorry and he was new. He was a tall skinny guy with dark (longer ish) hair.  To the owner of this place, keep in mind this is how your staff is treating customers. To all other patrons, I would avoid it. We ended up down the street at a Mexican place where the servers actually wanted to serve us."}
{"text":"Love the service here!  Ashley was bar tending and made me the best Ricky Foster I've ever had. I highly recommend the next time you're here you try the best summer time drink, the Ricky Foster!"}
{"text":"Dos Gringos was a pretty cool place to grab a beer with and chill with some friends. It wasn't packed or anything but there was still a lot of people inside - which was okay because the place was big enough to where you weren't bumping against people while trying to get around.  Lots of TV's inside and plenty of tables and places to sit. I liked that the music was loud, but not blasting so you were able to carry on a conversation on the outside patio if you wanted. I didn't get to eat here, so this review is based solely on the establishment and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Taco Tuesday/Tequila Tuesday. The margaritas are dankalicious. The tacos don't rock my world, but are reasonably priced. Love the quesadillas, love the outdoor seating. Service is hit or miss, more toward the miss, but I've come to accept and embrace this because overall, Dos Gringos is so fun. PS No bunnies allowed"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening and was surprised that it wasn't packed The outdoor patio seating area was nice even if the mists were going 80mph It wasn't that hot but whatevs  Our server was really great She was nice and very attentive  This is a great place for drinks I had a house marg and it was yummy The food... I was kinda iffy about it So I asked the server what she liked  I got a 2 option dish... Enchiladas and rolled tacos or something I was really surprised by how tasty they were They also came with rice & beans My group was very pleased by the food here and we would stop by if we are ever in the area again  Ps- they have Cornhole here"}
{"text":"Dos has fallen far from It's old Tempe trailer park!!! I used to always hang at the Dos in Tempe on University dr just a step away from the ASU campus and Mill Ave. It was always I nice laided back place with a great Atmosphere. Now they want to be a big chain and there is no longer $2 corona's all day everyday like it used to be, Now Dos is some crappy bar/club. I was doing a search on youtube and came accross a video that was taken at this place, you can find it yourself by typing (dos gingos bouncer) In this video there was a drunk guy small harmless guy yelling obsivley not going to do anything and then this dushbag bouncer Punched this extreamly drunk guy knocked him out cold, then the bouncer jumps around beatting his chest  yelling woo woo, what a joke! The guy should not be called a bouncer because it's not there job to harm customers even if they are dumb drunk. The video is pretty funny though. But it just shows that Dos Gringos is not the laid back place it used to be."}
{"text":"We had my fiance's and my combined birthday party there this past Friday. We had great service!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite dive bars in Scottsdale.  Cheap drinks, good eats and a nice relaxed atmosphere.  Nicely located for a watering hole while walking around old town..."}
{"text":"Received a very professional message from someone at Dos Gringos.  Very much appreciated, we ended up going back for a beer and had a much better experience.  End the end, not a place for us."}
{"text":"I always seem to have a great time at this place.  Always crowded and has plenty of space to move around on most nights - but it can get packed.  You don't have to come here dressed to kill - even with it being in Scottsdale, jeans and t shirt are just fine.   The alcohol prices are fair and I have had their wings on few occasions during college football - I believed that they were great - but I had a lot to drink - so what isn't good then?    Was here for New Years Eve and the music and atmosphere was good.     The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that their bathrooms are the worst smelling bathrooms- I don't know what they could do to make it better - being that so  many people use them and they would almost need a full time janitor.  But the smell of ass sometimes linger out to the open aired bar.......But don't let that deter you.  Awesome place, awesome staff, awesome drinks..... go the bathroom before you come here and hold it as long as you can!!!!!"}
{"text":"Listen - this joint is exactly what you have come to expect.  The service is reliable, the beers are always cold and it's the only place other than Mexico that I consistently enjoy Corona.    Their food is good, especially their mini chimis and quest dip - and the ambiance never disappoints.  Dining / drinking outdoors is one of my favorite things about Arizona - and for like 8 months out of the year, this is one of my favorite places to go to happy hour.  Can't go wrong - you'll never be blown away by anything, but it is always consistently better than average!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp tacos black beans and rice...came out cold dry and flavorless...my husband had the wings and street tacos he seem to like them. The bags area for kids was helpful entertainment. Most likely won't be back"}
{"text":"OVERPRICED. Watch out for the losers with tall socks and flipped brims :)"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate frat bar!! The only place where 50lb guys can get away with wearing a cut off asu shirt..other than that..not too shabby"}
{"text":"Bam!  This place really pops.  Either that or no other place was opened that night.  Definitely, not my cup of tea any more.  Everyone here was so young and I felt so old haha.  Granted, I think if you just wanted a few drinks with the guys, this is a great spot.  Drinks are cheap and the music is bumping.  The music isn't bad; then again I was really listening.  I was busy playing the games in the back room.  Pool tables, extra large jenga, connect 4, and bean bag throwing (which I sucked) come and bring your A game!  I wouldn't say this would be a great pickup bar as some signs suggest, but if you're a gal pal then by all means. - enjoy!"}
{"text":"No specials on cinco de mayo. Usually they have Corona lights on special everyday. Quote from server \"we dont need specials on cinco de mayo since they don't need to promote business.\" 30 bucks for 6 beers. Bull."}
{"text":"I'm an Iguana Mack's kinda girl but we often go for \"one more next door\" or for food. Dos is a fun bar. I think it's even more fun on a night that's kind of slow. Bartenders are all fun and attentive which is really important to me. The stuff that's painted on the walls is pretty funny, especially in the bathroom. Great specials. I love that they have $1 shots when it rains!"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed Dos Chandler for a few years now, I used to just drink their Negra Modelo and Dos X, but recently started eating the super ewey gooey chimi, which I would recommend to anyone.  Their quesadillas are awesome, they don't get much better than that.  (And I work in a New Mexican style kitchen). I feel they should offer more Mexican beers on tap, and definitely need more tequila options.  The frozen margaritas aren't anything to brag about, however.  The tables are usually sticky now whenever I sit down..and I haven't had a consistent server or bartender in a long time, there is always someone new, but they do a decent job taking care of me, but I can tell they don't have much support management-wise on the floor.  I give three stars due to dirty tables, poor beer selection on tap, and the usual generic tequila selection.  Being a Mexican restaurant they need to step up their game and clean the place up."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying, I haven't been to a Dos Gringos in 2 years; however, when I did go, I loved their Sunday morning Bloody Mary bar!    Last Sunday my wife and I went to this Dos Gringos and it was exactly how I remembers it... for the most part. It was fresh with plenty of goodies to toss in our drinks. I popped in some jalapeño, olives with red pepper flakes, little tiny onions, Tabasco and then... I was in a panic!! There was no bacon!! I asked the near by waitress and she apologetically said that they didn't have bacon strips to go with it. I felt a little let down, but all in all, it was still pretty darn tasty. The freshness of the other stuff made everything ok. The bacon though... that would have gotten them the fifth star ;)"}
{"text":"I went there for first time the service  was awesome only issue was menu was kind of weak I would if expected more drinks and food but great service"}
{"text":"I am pretty sensitive to spicy foods so I am careful with Mexican restaurants. We came here for fajitas and the carnitas was horrible. The chicken and shrimp were both super spicy as is their rice. They said everything is marinated beforehand so they can't make it differently. Another time, I tried tacos and mini chimis - both were VERY SPICY. They only give you one thing of chips and salsa and charge for chips thereafter. Also, if you sit outside, beware of smokers. I learned something new. I didn't think smoking was allowed inside or outside of restaurants but there were people smoking. As a cancer thriver I'm very careful about that. One time, we caught our server taking a vap hit from a guy.   I've been here enough times to know that it's not for me."}
{"text":"Delicious food (had the street tacos, boyfriend had the gringo tacos), even the chips and salsa were yummy, great music and our server, Brandon was so friendly and attentive.  We will be back!  It is an outside atmosphere so prepare for weather temps, but they have fans."}
{"text":"Was here visiting friends and stopped here for libations.  Tasty and strong margaritas.  So strong that my friend could barely finish hers.  It was cold and the heater was awesome.  We had a fun time and the servers were very attentive.  Also, they had an inflatable snowman as a holiday decoration, and a drunk guy came up and punched it and then tried to get in the bar.  He was summarily denied access.  Good call, bouncer, good call..."}
{"text":"I never thought I would say  this about this place but I have to be honest. This place was TERRIBLE when we went there to eat.  Yes, I know its a \"bar\" atmosphere, but I had eaten there before with my family and it had been a good experience in all manners ( both food and service).   But recently an experience that I had was horrible in both manners. First of all , the food was HORRIBLE. The order had 2 different things wrong with it and besides that , the taste was NOT fresh at all. The tacos werent good at all.   Then , the person I was with had ordered a beer , which was on happy hour and when the server ( which was horrible too ) , came back asked if he wanted another beer, he said yes and she didnt bother to tell us that it was going to be regular price which was more than double the price of happy hour cause we missed it by a \"few minutes\" .. So the happy hour beer was 2.00 and the regular priced same beer ws 4.50.!!!!!!!!!!  When I asked the server about the change she was just irritated with me that i questioned her. The entire thing was TERRIBLE.. the server was too busy talking to other staff and ignoring our table and they werent that busy in the restaurant, so its not like it was a challenge. Overall I would rate this as horrible and I will NEVER go here again..EVER"}
{"text":"Two stars for the decent food and the male Bartender. Aside from that,  this place is a joke.  I ordered a drink from my server and after 15 minutes (any time I approached her to ask she just walked by ignoring eye contact) I decided to hit the bar. The fellow behind the bar apologized and although not swifty, made me a cocktail.  The second drink I ordered was through the female bartender.  After sitting patiently for 10 minutes I asked if she had forgot my order....yep! And it happened to most of our party. He was great, she was awful.  Moral of the story is just that. I won't be back here again voluntarily."}
{"text":"2 stars just for good service ... 0 for food and DJ.  I don't know what the food is like in the daytime and realize this was Friday PM bar food but was driving by at 11pm, and a bit peckish and saw it was open w/sign saying 'kitchen open late' and the place seemed a bit poppin' so dropped in.  I got a 4 crispy taco basket ... seriously they were the worst tacos I've ever had anywhere, ever.    It was overfried tortillas filled with WAY overfried meat, with a sprinkle of lettuce on top ... and that literally was it.  They were DRIPPING with grease, with like a pool of oil at the bottom of the basket they rested in.    I asked bartender/server for some salsa and cheese which she promptly brought, so kudos on her service she was cool, but that couldn't save these monstrosities posing as tacos.    Taco Bell, and even the lowly 2 for 1.29 Jack in the Box soy-based tacos ... honestly beat the pants off these things.  Only ate about 1/2 and gave up in disgust.  Moral of story ... don't ever order late-night crispy tacos at this place.    Last comment ... the DJ seemed to think it was neat to blast a hip-hop track with a female artist repeatedly exhorting the listener to 'lick that (kitty) just like you should', and then 'my lips, my back, lick my (kitty) and my crack ... ' ... pretty much over and over.  Sounded like a pron soundtrack, which I can appreciate ... but in another setting.  Mebbe I'm just getting old but I mean it's 11pm in Mesa AZ, not 3am in SF/NYC, you feel me DJ?  C'mon now.  A LITTLE class ... might be nice."}
{"text":"So disappointing. My friends and I have been going here for a long time (as one of them lives within walking distance).   On a Saturday night we walked over thirsty and excited for the weekend. God's honest truth, not one us the six of us had a sip of alcohol prior to our arrival yet we were greeted with, \"I'm sorry one of you appears to be swaying and I can't let you in.\"   When we spoke to the manager, he didn't offer ANY SOLUTION what-so-ever! Big mistake. We won't be returning. PS. Check out the Social Box much nicer atmosphere for a classy Saturday night. Drinks are excellent!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews with interest, and all of the focus is on people, crowds, etc. I want to weigh in on a different topic: Lunch. I went with a buddy for a lunch on a Friday, with meetings scheduled in the afternoon, thus Diet Cokes instead of beers or better. I ordered the Baja Shrimp Sandwich, $5.99 on lunch special, he ordered a grilled fish taco and beans and rice on the side. His was about $6.50 My sandwich came out in a reasonable time frame, contained huge amounts of shrimp, and tasted great. His had a bunch of chunks of grilled fish, and he was raving about the quality of the beans surpassing Tia Rosa's, one of our work favorites. There weren't that many people there, SportsCenter was on the TV, and the waitress was a nice peice of eye candy.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I gave it one star because its only saving grace is that the kitchen is open late...and it serves Pepsi.  I ordered (so typical of me) their supersomethinggooey chimichanga. You may as well have brought me a pile of flaming poo. It looked so unappetizing when it was plunked down in front of me. You know when you were a kid and you were forced to eat something you hated and you did all you could to prolong the agony? Well, there were no potted plants within range for me to dump my food in and the napkins were so flimsy I couldn't spit my bites out gracefully. Instead, I pushed away the food and claimed, \"I savored every bite and now I'm full.  I'll take it home.\" My friend loves that place. Why? I can't understand it, either. I dumped the leftovers off in the trash at the Taco Bell I ended up at.  Service was crap, food was crap, parking was crap. It's located around the corner from my husband's old office...but hell, if the die hard alkies of my husband's office wouldn't go there, that's saying something. Geez, it's stumbling or in their case, tumbling, distance from work. Even happy hour couldn't persuade the guys to go.  Yes, it's that bad. You know it's bad when the alcoholics say no.  Thank god it's all you can drink Pepsi or I wouldn't know what to do with myself. *rolls eyes* I know what I'd do - I'd go to Jack in the Box across the street and bring it over because JITB is better than whatever Dos Gringos could ever try to feed me.  PS -- What's up with those park benches for tables?"}
{"text":"Great place to go for cheap margaritas and some fun!  They have games throughout the indoor portion of the restaurant to keep you and your friend occupied.  We spent a couple of hours here playing jenga.  If you sit outdoors at the bar - BEWARE of the bees!!!! They are everywhere.  The bartenders didn't seem to be phased by this, at all."}
{"text":"Home of the $2 Dos....Equis that is... Since this is the closest to my house (and I've been to the others) I like coming here when I feel like an after work beer and an afternoon breeze. the bartenders here are always good to me (which unfortunately, is more than I can say for the Scottsdale crew, just seems to much of a clique up there).  Love the food, love the crowd here as well.I'll miss you when I move Chandler DOS"}
{"text":"Great place to get cheap drinks....which is oh so rare in Scottsddale.  It's a relaxed atmosphere, they have oversized games there to play... such as an enormous version of jenga and connect four.  It's mostly a (huge) patio bar.  highly recommend for those jeans and a tee,  'lets just grab a drink or two' nights."}
{"text":"Another great meal @dos!  I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  I thank the Taco Gods when I walk in the door because they have every kind of taco you could crave!  The Mexican Crockpot cracks me up.  yummy pork served with chips.  Wonderful in a tortilla! I simply adore the Baja Shrimp Tacos, street taco version sans rice and beans.  Downed my tacos with a couple Dos XX Lager and a Juicy Lucy cigar.  Oh ya, you can smoke on this patio!  Boo-yah! (no, i am not a smoker, lol). I had the nachos once when I was totally sloshed and I remember they were really yummy, too."}
{"text":"Had another GREAT day at Dos.  Went with sister, husband, and my husband.  We noticed the menu is redone and the Mexican crock pot has said Adios!  Too bad.  The tacos are still very good and a great $2 price!  They now serve breakfast all day long.  It wasn't great, but we come here to drink and smoke our cigars!  I had the bfast skillet w/egg, chorizo, potatos and lots of cheese.  M had the bfast burrito, he said it wasnt that great, but it was huge! (that's what she said!)  My sister had the always delish steak tacos and her hubby had a combo plate.  We had pineapple/oj/vodka drink special (yum!  I had 3 of these!) and the guys had the bloody mary bar.  It was full of pickes, onion, olives, jicama, carrot, celery, garlic, pepper, worsheterchire sauce (sp), A1, celery salt, salt, tabasco, tapatio, Clamato/ other mixer.   Nice selection, and I don't drink those things!"}
{"text":"Typically a crowded mess of striped button downs and buckle shoes, but hey, everyone likes what they like, which is fortunate for me, because *I* especially like that Dos can corral most of the people I generally abhor into one perfect, double-decker horny beehive.    I simply do not understand how this faction of people exist to be ridiculous, 30-something wankers, itching for piece of college ass where survival-of-the-fittest theory would generally chew these hopefuls up and spit them out into Yuma for being downright useless to the perpetuation of modern society.  Whatever.  You wanna see some mouthbreathers?  Wanna be baptized clumsily in Corona by a swallow of leather-sandaled, pleated Beta Kappa class of '94?  Here's your shot.  I can't get over how annoying most of these people are.  They must be a pleasure to know and buy drinks for and invite over for your Super Bowl party.  This place would be pretty awesome if not for the \"half-your-age-plus-seven\" 's.    After all, it IS a good place to day drink."}
{"text":"Great food and a fun place to hang before a spring training game!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet with friends after the comedy show.  Like a mini high school reunion.  Maybe I am not in my 20s anymore and like the dingy bar atmosphere anymore.  Wow.... The place is dirty, sticky, and just ek.  The restroom on my, it was scary.  The service was horrible to top off the experience."}
{"text":"Went there for taco Tuesday for my work about a month ago and order some to go. They were really good. However, I went there today, and the same bartender that helped me before said she wouldn't let me get any to go? What? So I asked to speak to a manager and the general manager came out and said he wouldn't do it. And it must have been an exception that one time. I explained it wasn't an exception, she did it no problem. He refused our order. And said \"nobody does taco Tuesday's to go\"  Really, cause I have never had anyone not allow it.   So I went down the street to Los Taquitos and ordered a ton of food to go (all taco Tuesday items), and a month and a half ago backyard taco took our order to go for taco Tuesday to go without even question! (Backyard taco has the best tacos around but are slightly farther away).  You guys just lost lots of business as our company has over 200 employees and our organization has over 2,000 locally.  The sad part is I was there years ago when the chandler Dos opened and was friends with the owner and he would never have acted that way.  Now I see why they were dead at lunch time on Taco Tuesday at this location."}
{"text":"I do like this place.  Taco tuesday is a great value here!  My biggest disappointment is that they won't honor their special when the spring training games are on....so they just loose this local to the other bar down the road for awhile!  I have updated my review to reflect 5 stars!  I did this as a result of the contact from the Customer Service Manager Jeff.  He contacted me and explained it must have been a mistake on the part of the staff.  They DO HONOR their specials even during the Spring traning games!!!  WOOHOO!!!   He was very genuine in his communication and very nice. It is this kind of reaching out over just a little issue that makes a business stand out!!!  I am on my way back!! THANKS DOS GRINGOS!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Dos Gringos twice now.  Once on a Saturday afternoon and then last night (a Friday).  I've enjoyed myself both times.  They've got a great patio....lots of tables, misters and fans.  The Saturday afternoon was very mellow.  Not many people there....outside anyways.  Margs were decent....so was the food.  Nothing spectacular though.  Last night we got there during happy hour.  There were plenty of tables available, and we had a bunch of $3 margs and $5 appetizers.  They also had a really fun band, but they were unfortunately done playing by like 9pm.  Wish they could have played longer but I guess there's a DJ there later.  Overall, a fun place.  I didn't see anyone behaving badly, but we left by 10pm.  There were all different types of people...all different ages.  Maybe things get a little crazier as it gets later.  Don't know.  We'll definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"I was really having a difficult time figuring out what i wanted to rate this place. I really don't care for the food or service overall but we know one guy in genera(who i think is a manager) and has been with this dos gringos location for a couple years since I have moved out to AZ in 2009.  For some reason the nachos lose more and more star points with me since the first night i ever tried them in 2009.  I never love the service from everybody only the one guy(as i am still trying to remember his name) If we ever have a problem with the drinks we always have him take it back and fix it. But that kind of shows you that other people are not doing it right the first time.  We always order the nachos from this place and i cannot tell you how much i hate nacho cheese. I just love to death a place that has regular melted cheese and meats/beans/sour cream/guacamole. Not a mix between regular and nacho cheese.  but i will def eat it if i've been drinking. I love food and savor every flavor (if its amazing) so i can never give a fair review if i had been drinking i would have to go back a time where i am completely sober and coherent.  1 thing i have noticed about the chicken on the nachos is that they are usually pretty dry. i kind of wish they would grill the chicken and place it on the nachos after they take the nachos out of the oven.    Just an A-OK from me even though we are here a couple times every other month or so."}
{"text":"Been in here a couple times to day drink. Went in there last night with a couple friends around 1030, sat down at a table and apparently we were weren't good enough to be customers. No one acknowledged us/served us/or even said hi. We had to walk up to the bar which was in plain view from our table, to get menus, then waited another ten minutes. Still didn't even get a \"we'll be right with you\" so we left. Sent an email to their manager no reply so far, so we'll see what happens. Maybe I can call corporate about it.  Oh and the one star is for the actual place. Cool place, nice setup, but you can see how a couple amateur employees can ruin potential business."}
{"text":"Like coming here.  Good food. Never to packed.  But they always get a dj who cranks the music up so dang loud to where no one is dancing. No one is parting.   But it is so dang loud that you can not here friends.  They have games witch is awesome but you are right in front of the speakers of the dj.   Noticed that our group is coming here less and less due to the dj.  Having a dj normally is wonderful and welcome. But. They play the music so loud that I stopped drinking. And switched to water.... I know it sounds like I'm whining about the dj but it has been the same for the last 4 times I have been here.  Disappointed with this dos...."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the environment is fun and welcoming. I had the cheesygooeychimi with shredded beef and it was amazing. I will definitely be getting that again."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill!!! Who in the world charges for chips & salsa at a Mexican restaurant??? They never did before, happy 2017 if you wanna get screwed, come here! Food was barely warm, such a disappointing experience.  Brought friends here from TX and was embarrassed by their service, will NEVER come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick and relaxing lunch.  Very casual and the price is right!  If you are expecting authentic Mexican then you've got the wrong spot... I wouldn't even classify it as Tex-Mex... So what it is it?  It's just good old Americanized Mexican style food that fills you up for a good price and provides a laid back and loose environment.  Good service from quality servers that remember you and what you like and drop it on you every time you grab a table.  Outside tables are perfect for this time of year and it is the best atmosphere for conversation and relaxing during a busy day.  If you want to lighten your day, grab a partner and trundle on over.  Just awesome!"}
{"text":"We came to this place once and had a rough experience. That was about 5 months ago. We decided to try it again to give it another chance. Still a rough experience. Service is horrible, food is horrible, (dry chicken that didn't even look like chicken, ground beef tasted like marinara sauce), the environment is horrible. It always looks/feels dirty, it's always so hot inside, if you eat outside you're surrounded by smoke. The music is so loud inside and it's usually screamo music! Definitely not a great place to eat. I gave it two stars because the chicken tacos are pretty good!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and my margarita was to die for. But the service was pretty rough. Our waitress checked on us three times. Once to take drink orders, once to take our order, and once to bring us a pitcher of water. Between 7 of us we went through that pitcher rather quickly and then we didn't see our waitress for at least 40 minutes. I had to walk to the bar myself to get our check. If it was busy I could totally understand this but it was 3 o'clock on a week day and there were maybe 4 other people there sitting at the bar. I would say the main downfall is that the servers aren't very interested in helping their guests but like I said the food and drink is really good!"}
{"text":"I usually come here whenever I visit Arizona and I love it every time.  There is always a lot of people and good times.  I like how it is open air and Mexico themed, brings me back:)  The bartenders are always nice and on top of shit.  There is no cover either, which is always a plus.  Also, their carne asada tacos are BOMB!"}
{"text":"Tonight I was looking for some evening entertainment. I wanted something fun but without a lot of noisy crowds. Dos Gringos was the perfect choice. The outdoor seating provides a lovely area to relax with friends while enjoying some food and drinks. An added bonus was the outdoor games (I got to practice my mad Jenga skills). Everything was very reasonably priced. They had taco Tuesday going on, which I'm always a fan of and definitely took advance of.  The food was good and the drinks were strong. They also had some stand-up comedians preforming which was extremely entertaining. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Overall, a fabulous place to come for adult fun."}
{"text":"I'm not much for bars but since my friends are this is their jam. This place has friendly staff. I enjoyed the Jenga & been bag games. better than being at a grungy old bar"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service was good. The inside of the place is pretty cool and I enjoyed the large connect four game, and my daughter enjoyed the corn hole. The female service was good, and this one girl inperticular was good. She wasn't our server, but brought us chips and just had a good personality. I wish I knew her name for a shoutout. Moving on, food was bad. We did not like this food and we will definitely not return If we are looking for some bomb mexican food. I wouldn't mind having a drink here, but in terms of a \"grill\", not good stuff. Bar, A+ enviroment, restaurant, F"}
{"text":"A great place for meeting your friends, particularly if you like a lively environment.  Televisions everywhere -- obviously a great place to watch a Cardinals game on Sunday.  I especially like the \"No Firearms Allowed\" sign by the front door: my kind of place -- with the margaritas they sell here!  The food is good.  The margaritas are good.  ¡Ole!  Good customer service.  Prices are outstanding.  It was very warm in the restaurant, so it's not clear to me whether the inside restaurant is air conditioned during the day.  When we came in (early evening) the doors were all open: it was only 95° -- but it is a very dry heat, huh?"}
{"text":"Total dive, exactly what we wanted. Outside seating area was weathered but comfortable. Was able to feel the sun while having a margarita.  Can't beat that. After a few questions about the food, we made a choice of something cheeseygooeygood. The jalapeno cream sauce on the top could be put on an old shoe, and I would eat it. Salsa had the perfect amount of heat, chips fresh. Drinks cold. Waitress was always quick with drink refills."}
{"text":"Food is alright - nothing special and certainly not authentic Mexican flavors. But the staff is nice, the specials are good, and it's a fun hangout on a Thursday or Friday night. The life size Jenga is always fun!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually go to the dealerships around the block to get our cars serviced. While we are waiting, we walk over to Dos for some drinks and food. Cheryl always takes really great care of us! The gringo tacos are delicious!"}
{"text":"Like Stacy, I wanted this place to be good. I like the outdoor vibe, the patio, the dog friendliness, it seems like a really cool place to drink. Big, too. Service was great too.  However, I find the prices here outside of happy hour to be outrageous for a dive bar. $17 for a pitcher? $17 for a fajita plate? No free chips and salsa? Those are almost Vegas strip caliber prices! I mean, if it was gourmet food ala Joyride, it'd be one thing, but it's typical bland Mexican bar food that you can get on every street corner in the Valley. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't *bad*, but it was nothing special and certainly not for the extortional prices they charge.  That all being said, I'd definitely come back during happy hour or for a late night drink. I would not come here to eat."}
{"text":"We so wanted this place to be good.  Really we did.  We have been here for (nearly) four months and have yet to find a Mexican restaurant we like, which is very disappointing.  Any suggestions are welcome!  I found this place on the Phoenix's event calendar stating that they offer good mimosa and bloody mary deals on the weekends.  Honestly, I just thought the pictures looked fun and the over-sized Jenga needed to be played.  So, we used our Saturday morning to give this place a go.  When you walk up, it is fairly obvious that this place took over what used to be a lawn and garden center of a store.  Nothing wrong with that - it was funky and eclectic.  The entryway is neat and has fun touristy \"stick-your-face\" in the cutout and look like something else photo props out front.  We decided it was decent enough outside to sit in their porch area under one of the misters.    The booths are two steps up and fun - but a touch awkward for our shorter waitress considering that the extra foot off the ground for the table didn't exactly extend her reach.  We got our drinks quickly and I order the pick 2 combo while my fiancee ordered the street tacos.    My pick 2 - gringo rolls and mini tacos (fried mini tacos with shredded beef and avocado salsa) which came with a side of rice / beans - $10.  His meal was the shredded chicken mini tacos with jalapeno salsa (didn't include rice and beans) - $11.    Gringo Rolls - decent.  Kinda bland.  It was simply mashed black beans and cheese wrapped in a tortilla.  They weren't bad, but weren't amazing.  Mini Tacos were my favorite, but just as the name implies they were definitely tiny and there were only 2 of them on the plate.  Surprisingly the rice and beans were totally bland and without flavor.  Boo.  I'll be honest, I was hungry about 2 hours later.   The waitress was nice and got us refills and such in a timely manner.  No complaints there.    Overall: C- (I would recommend them for a late night bar to drink some beer and watch tv - that's about it - maybe play a round of giant Jenga.)"}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is what it is and what you make of it. It's a frequent stop on our Old Town Scottsdale Bar crawls because it has a huge outdoor patio and can easily accomodate all of us.   I love taking pictures of all the crazy signs on the walls, ceilings, and doors. There's usually a DJ spinning tunes on weekends nights and people dance in the back by the bathrooms.  I recommend taking your out-of-town guests here so they, too can experience Old Town at it's finest. The crowd is usually in their early to mid- twenties, at least until me and my friends invade the place. Like I said- \"It is what it is\".  UPDATE: I just learned that Dos's patio is leashed dog friendly until dark."}
{"text":"Casual and laid back  bar with a great patio area. Service is usually pretty good as is the food. Only complaint is their margaritas taste like turpintine. And they recently replaced my Malibu Rum with... yes, that fake Parrot Bay sh*t. They just lost a star!!"}
{"text":"Their Cinco party is one of the better ones in the Mesa/Gilbert area. The patio is ginormous. Service is hit or miss, usually sitting at the bar eliminates that problem. Pours are pretty generous. Happy hour specials are very good."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays! Nom. Really good deals on their Monster Tacos (three bucks per), cervezas and tequila drinks. They also had other taco options that were also good deals. We ordered (party of two) a total of four chicken-chorizo Monster Tacos. They were a good deal for their price point, but be sure to add a side of sour cream, quac and/or salsa as the tacos are bland AF.  Why the two stars for Dos Gringos? The service there is sslllloooowww. ¡Es muy lento! From the time we arrived and were acknowledged to the random table check ups, the service was sslllloooowww. Our waitress even forgot to bring back our card after charging it, leaving us to hunt for her after ten minutes. Apparently it got \"too busy\" for her although there was only one other table of eight aside from us. Yikes. Best of luck on the assumably busier weekend shift."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood spot! The bartender Chuck, rocks! (literally, he's in a band called \"Grain of Truth\") and besides the service, Monday nights ($2 U-call it's) with DjMrEaton have been a lot of fun. Well at least the last three I've been too!"}
{"text":"I want to update my review from several years because The current manager sent a 25$ for me to try the restaurant again, 7 , yes ,7 years later. So that in itself is worth an extra star.  This time around : No one acknowledged us when we walked in. We had to seat ourselves. Our waitress was nice and did a decent job. The salsa was good but they charge for chips and salsa and charge extra for more salsa. But the food was good.   All in all, it's average ,So that is why my rank is still a 3/5 add an extra star for the manager who is striving for more."}
{"text":"Update: I'm updating to 3 stars Solely for customer service. I can't wait to go back and try again."}
{"text":"This will be the second time posting this as I received an email from the Yelp HQ that it was \"outside of their content guidelines\". Could it have been for Inappropriate language, or the fact that the restaurant doesn't want to be viewed as the racists they are. Mind you I did add amplifying information since the original review \"did not have enough detail\".  I rate this place a ZERO. Sorry excuse for service. He had an issue every time we flagged him down for service. An attitude when we placed an order, and didn't even bother to check on us. Furthermore, the white waiter had the audacity to racially profile and directly target my friend in which he called her \"homegirl\" and told her she was no longer welcome in the establishment and had to leave.  If you're not white, don't bother coming!  I will never step foot in this establishment again."}
{"text":"First and last time here. The food was horrible, it was like frozen food. The drinks were terrible, you're better off sticking to bottled beer cause it's a safe bet.  And having a parrot squak while you're tying to eat and talk to your friends was not fun!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot and Brandi is amazing. I love coming to see her on Tuesdays. She takes great care of all her customers."}
{"text":"Service is ridiculously bad.  Got here at 6:57pm and didn't even get a menu until 7:17pm."}
{"text":"This is a very comfortable eating spot.   Not only is the food great(try the green chili), but the service is top notch.   The location takes full advantage of th Arizona weather. The servers are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"pretty laid back, good drinks and food. a couple times i went and the misters were broken and leaking. otherwise, like it"}
{"text":"Would be nice to know how the food and drinks were if I wasn't ignored for almost 15 minutes while standing at the bar. Went to Applebee's instead why bother spending money at a place that won't even acknowledge you for being there."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! I found a RUBBER SPATULA in my taco, and the waitress did not handle the situation well whatsoever. She apologized for my findings, but that was it, no offer for a refund or remake (wouldn't have accepted but still the offer would've been nice). The chef did not even come out and apologize. DISGUSTING. birds flying around the inside as you eat, too ghetto...."}
{"text":"Not much needs to be said about a bar devoted to being besotted.  The various signs with catch phrases and college colloquialisms attest to this.  \"I like your pants. Especially on my floor,\" says it all.    Perhaps a devoted patron of this bar would respond with \" Don't take life too seriously, you're not going to make it out alive,\" another turn of phrase that can be found mounted with Rocky Point pride in this establishment.  The atmosphere is meant to be very casual, laid back - like you were spending your spring break in Puerto Penasco.  But the similarities end there.  Quite possibly home of the worst house margarita - so full of the synthetic and syrupy sweet and sour mix that there is nothing more discernible.  Despite there being a full bar, the bartenders have little knowledge of cocktail recipes - I would recommend ordering beer by the bottle.  Although a full menu is available, there is no better word to describe the food than...bad.  If you have ever had a bonafide street taco in Mexico, then you will be dismally disappointed by their poor imitation.  One would assume that it is quite difficult to mess up a taco, but here they got everything wrong in both the preparation of the meat and the salsa that shamefully tried to mask the poor taste of the meat.    There is no need to dissect the menu or its gustatory offerings any further, as Dos is quite frankly a place to play beer pong and get wasted.  It does offer a variety of entertainments such as Tuesday comedy nights and Wednesday's Texas hold 'em.  Bean bag tournaments are also held here.  Dos certainly caters to a specific crowd, I am not one of those that feel as though they still want to be on spring break."}
{"text":"Cool patio, we sat out back where there were nice big booths with benches to sit on, lots of decorations everywhere and funny signs to read. Food was good all around the table- chips & salsa, street tacos, breakfast burrito, mini chimis, & chicken flautas. Not one complaint from anybody we were with. We were in there on a Friday night and they had a nice flow of music from a deejay and a girl walking around with whipped jell-o shots, fun environment for sure! Was a good crowd without being overly crowded too."}
{"text":"This place is pretty gross. Cheese quest was nasty. Chicken fajitas were over cooked no flavor. Only one beer on tap."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. My food was mediocre. Waitstaff was very....again, underwhelming. We ordered some enchiladas, a burrito and a kids meal. The rice was hard in chunks, beans looked like they were under the \"heat lamp\" a little too long. With so many great options in the valley, I was sad this one wasn't what we were expecting. May be back to drink a couple beers, but not for food."}
{"text":"Here is the thing.  I really wanted to like this place and I love the location in Scottsdale, but this just really was not to great the night I went.  We came during happy hour on a Thursday and ended up staying quit a while.  The stay was friendly and attentive, no issues there.  It is just little things I could not get past.  For instance the patio, had a lot of bugs including bees and just was not clean.  I don't mean not clean by fine dining standards.  I am strictly talking your basic party/sports bar cleanliness.  Just very dusty with random junk sitting around.  The other thing was the lack of draft selection.  Nowadays everyone has a good tap selection.  The only beer I recall outside of your basic American lagers was Blue moon served in a plastic \"glass\".  I can't get too mad about that though because the place does seem like a party bar and I could see the reasoning.  The misters were dripping pretty bad as well, so you had to watch out for those.  The last thing I did not understand was why have a jukebox and not let patrons use it.  I was with a decent sized party the night I was there and while the classic rock soundtrack they played did not bother me, I am sure the group would have had a bit more fun if we could have played music.  Had a little bit of food and it was solid no complaints there.  The place has potential and I would love to see it on a packed night because many of the flaws I saw you could probably overlook, but for my visit I'll have to stick to 3 stars and that is being kind because I am a smoker."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos can kiss my California BOOTY!!  The only people who come here are losers who THINK they are cool, people looking for a fight, and people who just turned 21.  The place is dirty and the staff is rude.  The bouncers think they rule the world and if you're not a \"regular,\" they hassle you.  God forbid you hold your beer bottle in a way that they don't like.  Listen up peeps - do yourselves a favor and pass this place up!  Meeting behind the dumpster with a bottle of tequila would be better than going inside this dump.  NEVER AGAIN DOS GRINGOS!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great and the salsa is out of this world!! The patio had a fun atmosphere, too!  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is absolutely over-the-top with cheezy signage encouraging day drinkers and tequila, to a point that you know they don't take themselves too seriously. Beer is cheap and drinks aren't too bad.   If it's cold outside (about 6 weeks per year for you out-of-towners) this isn't a good spot. It is very airy and open, which is why I like it in the sweltering summer. Most of its competitors pack you in to dark, cramped spaces and no amount of AC seems to cool things down. As with anywhere around Scottsdale, you'll still run into big crowds and belligerent frat boys, but I suppose it just seems more in place here. It's like our own little slice of Rocky Point, just without the bacon wrapped hot dogs."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Lots of TVs and they'll put any game on you want. Friendly staff. El Diablo hot wings were 5/10 but the fried burrito was awesome!   Guacamole sucks though and they charged extra for salsa! WHAT!"}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty fun to go to at night. In the daytime, it is a really chill place to hang out with friends and drink beer. The food (tacos) are not bad. They are on the small side but taste pretty good.   The only problem that I have with this place is that it does not smell very good. It's not extremely dirty (it is as clean as it can be with a ton of drunk people around all the time) but it just smells like bathroom."}
{"text":"Well, not coming back. 35 minutes went by and the waitress made eye contact three times... Hmmm... So Melissa, if your going to survive as a waitress, get it together."}
{"text":"Do you come here often? This old line would definitely work here. Great for families or old marrieds looking to get out of the house and laugh-out-loud for a few hours. This place is a brightly colored, entertainingly, loud, home away from home, covered in unexpected but, laughtasticly humorous saying that creatively remind you of where you are.  I have been here a few times in the past, with friends, unsually during the day (Day drinking, as their shirts say). So, the other Saturday night I decided to head over after some strenuous solo christmas shopping. Looking to relax, refuel, drink, flirt and..... (nevermind, it didn't happen anyways). I parked near the Greenfield side and walked up to what I thought was the main door. But, it was locked! The thought crossed my mind that they may be closed? But, the loud music led me around the corner to the chill-friendly security door check who informed me that they serve food until 2am and wished me a good time. As I made my way inside the place was pretty busy on the patio, with a live DJ, no seats left at the bar, and absolutley no one but staff on the inside, I guess that was their intention.  I found a nice spot (with great viewing) on a corner table in the patio area, far too big for just myself, but who knows, the night was still young... Within seconds, my server was at my table taking my drink order and right back to take my food order (Ugh, I MUST have looked famished! Or he's just that good?) He was back over in a few minutes with my chips and salsa and appologized that the food would be taking longer than normal. I thanked him and told him it was no problem, as I was in no hurry.   As I waited I finally had a chance to really look around. I have to admit, I was quite surprised to see so many regular farmer, construction types had filled the place with their jealous polential wife types (just the feeling I got). It reminded me of my visits to the NW! I guess I'll have to make an appearance at this place more often! I felt like the best looking thing to happen to this place in awhile and I was totally cas in jeans and sneakers! It was a little surreal! Although the stinky eye lady glances in my general direction were getting a bit annoying (...remember, corner table seat.) I wanted to say: Ladies, PUHLEASE, I am NOT looking at your man! ...I am simply trying to lip read Joe Rogan's mouth for the details of the UFC fight. (the other best looking thing in the place, besides me. Yeah, it was one of THOSE nights) Sheesh! But, they would have never heard me over the DJ beats and the cornhole game happening in the walk way.   Just then, my food arrived. Luckily, I had asked them to make it to go. I had read the handy yelp reviews on this Supergooeycheese chimi thingy and Man! This thing did not dissappoint! I dug right into it! Fully loaded and super flavorful! It has this amazing smelling/ tasting jalapeno cream sauce and ?lbs of cheese I asked the servicer, but I forgot (lost in the deliciousness) he smiled as he explained, knowing exactly what I was experiencing. It actually got better with every overloaded mouth full! Quarterway through I paused just long enough to realize I was already stuffed! But, by that time I was pretty much done with the discomfort of the corner seat with a 'greeat' view.  Overall, a great place to take the fam to get out of the house for a nightlife atmosphere with generous sized portions of food and not have to dirty your own kitchen. Buuut, not the best place to go for a 'meeting' or a friendly conversation with strangers."}
{"text":"Oh Dos Gringos, how doth one review ye?  What is Dos Gringos? Honestly I never thought about it until I started this review. I would say first and foremost this is a place to drink, although they don't have any draught beers on tap. But they do have a decent selection of bottled beers. They do have one tap behind the bar but it only spits out margarita mix. And of course, they'll mix you a drink, too.  The layout of the place is a little different but it works well. As soon as you enter there is a center bar, a la Cheers. There are couple of SD TV's over the bartenders. The bar is surrounded by various tables. This area is sort of outside, so one can smoke if they like. The area just behind the bar holds more tables, HD TV's, a corn hole court, and of course the mandatory Golden Tee and Buck Hunter. Beyond this area is an inside dining area (no smoking allowed!) and another bar.   Don't let this place fool you. The food is really good. Come in during the day and you'll see families who bring in friends from out of town. I often see large parties there around dinner time. I haven't had everything on the menu but I've never been disappointed. You can't go wrong with anything chicken; it is well marinated! And I've heard that they have a Sunday all-you-can-eat brunch.  Now for the real review. This place gets packed Thursday night through Sunday night. But the atmosphere is always chill. The makeup is not as diverse as Iguana Macks next door, but there is very little attitude in the place. I always meet someone every time I go. The party is hopping right up until closing time.   All of the Dos Gringos have their own atmosphere and their own crowd that they attract. The Greenfield one is more family oriented and an older crowd. The Kyrene is just really sad and pathetic. Tempe is very much a college bar. And Scottsdale is, well, it's Scottsdale. The Chandler site really can't be pigeon holed. It's 20 and 30 somethings out for a drink in a cool atmosphere. And the best part of Dos Gringos Chandler? It's right next to Iguana Macks!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place. The service was excellent,  but the food was horrid and far out weighted the service. The rice was so bad that I later realized it had chipped a tooth. The experience led to the relegation as to why the restaurant is named \"dos gringos,\" I had a bout of Montezuma's revenge, which would've conquered any Spanish Conquistador."}
{"text":"There are so many different places in Scottsdale that are better. The food is mediocre and the staff are total jerks. The bartender we dealt with gave us bad service and on top of that other members of the staff were very rude. Someone should remind them that customers drive their business so they shouldn't alienate them. We will not be back and you shouldn't go either."}
{"text":"Are used to go to this place a few times but lately snotty service the food is OK it's just a rundown place that you can do a lot better, I just can't sit at a place it's depressing it's like sitting in some Russian gulaog!!"}
{"text":"the only saving grace about this place is that after 10, they have their rocky pointe nachos for $4. those are super yummy BUT the place is a meat market and they have little to no wait staff. i'm sure i'll go again, but only if there's no other real options. you can smoke inside and that also is a plus.."}
{"text":"Katie was a great server!!! We had a party of quite a few women and she made it the best night possible for us! I wish I could rate her more than 5 stars! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was unique for me because everyone seemed like they were inside smoking but it was an indoor outdoorish place.  There were heated lights and it was the only place that I found pretty crowded where if you walked the streets there weren't a lot of people.    The food was good, I had the steak fajita, which you can't go wrong because its just steak.  But I also had a fish taco which was pretty good.  My boyfriend had the pick three meal, so he picked tacos, chimichanga, and enchilada.  His choice was good and the chimichanga was delish.    The bathrooms were very rustic looking but it seemed to look that way, decent for a funky place like that.  They had live music Friday night, where a guy was doing bad covers on a few good songs.  The waitstaff was overall nice and they checked back at us here and there.  Overall I'd go back if I was in around Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place! I came back to visit and was upset that they got rid of the beer pong tables :( still a fun environment with friendly staff! Wouldn't mind being a regular if I lived a bit closer!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great!! Definitely recommend getting the mini chimies and rice...Mmmm delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I chose to come here, after not really deciding on where to go on a late Friday night. Its one of those places like Filibertos, or Amado's thats usually open late at night, and you can expect it to not disappoint! Well sure enough, it was one of those places. I was pleased with the service provided. They didn't have a HUGE bar selection...but their queso dip was awesome! The DJ that night (Friday) didn't have the best choices either (sorry dude). It wasn't packed either, but that's a plus in my book. Will probably go back here a few times."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place to go. Its low key and fun and always full of interesting people. Could the bathrooms be cleaner- yes. Could the \"dance floor\" be bigger-sure. Do I want to venture elsewhere for a dance party- No way."}
{"text":"This is my brother's favorite place to go when he visits Phoenix.  So on the latest trip, we had to go again (my first time).  The misting was a little weird to me, but hey it's hot in Phoenix...even in September.  Our waitress was really great.  They have good drink prices, especially when they have specials going on.  Their cooling system leaks a bit, so water kept dripping on me.  But we just moved down to the other end of the bench.  Great place for big groups.  Now on to the food. I ordered the taco salad with carne asada.  It was really good.  How exciting that it even came with guac on it.  Yum.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing...my brother had to polish it off for me.  My brother ordered the Supercheeseygooeychimichanga, the same thing he gets each time.  He let me taste it.  I was not impressed.  Glad I chose the taco salad."}
{"text":"Excellent chill, lay back environment with decent food, great drinks and EXCELLENT customer service.   Thanks Cameron and Will for the witty and genuine service. The sarcasm was an added side dish.    I highly recommend this bar! Their appetizers and drinks were great. The staff were not your Scottsdale type of bar tenders. I went on a Wednesday night after a Brush Bar painting experience next door and it was a super chill environment.  I was super surprised to encounter country music, a laid back atmosphere and such fun bartenders.  They even invited us back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this bar! We came for Taco Tuesday and then again today.  Staff is great! Although I do feel bad that the front security has to sit under a broken heater. If it wasn't for the heaters by the tables I wouldn't visit.  It should be fixed for them, they keep your patrons and your bar safe!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girl last night . Although I'm use to security at many other places , wasn't prepared to be stopped at door here and asked to remove ID from wallet and submit for inspection then given the once over by \"security\" . If your looking for your first DWI here's the place to be as Chandler P.D. circled the premises not once , twice but 3 X in the 25 mins we were there . Never again ! Adios  Dos Gringos !  Only rate one star ....Because I have to ."}
{"text":"Oh, Dos...you are both what I love and hate about visiting PHX.  You remind me of where I'm from and how I grew up.  You remind me of why I left and that I needed to grow up.  You remind me of an Arizonan's version of Mexico is like...which is not the real Mexico.  You remind me of high school and college...mainly because I'll still run into peeps from high school and college at Dos...sigh.  This particular location is essentially like all the rest...gigantic bar, semi-outside, lots of booze, lots of beer, and lots of just relaxed people getting their drink on.  Nothing terrible but also nothing really great either...I'd still come back...but I'm glad I left."}
{"text":"These guys are thieves...bought two drinks on my debit charged me for 8...second time they've done this..manager wouldn't do anything to help or make it right...never go there again"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of being in Mexico a little bit.. food good ,  Has flavor. Service is good ...they have a really good DJ... I've tried the other place down the street that Valley Luna and this place by far blows it away"}
{"text":"Fun place. Huge Jenga game was so fun to play. 2 stories. Decent prices. Love old town."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened.  Not too bad of a place to hang out if you want greasy food, drinks and music in the East Valley.  Always been a 3 star kind of place for me.  A few Saturdays ago, I encountered the rudest bartender I've ever seen.  I've never seen her there before.  She was thin and wore a hat.  She did not speak to me.  She just looked at me and nodded.  I told her I wanted a Dos Equis.  She handed me the beer.  I asked her for a lime from behind the bar.  She stared at me for about 20 seconds and then went and got me a lime.  Again, never said one word to me.  No thank you no nothing.  Only thing she told me was the price of the beer.  \"If she hates her job this much, perhaps she should work somewhere else\" this is what I thought.  Then she went to the people next to me and said \"What can I get for you hun?\"  All pleasant and chipper sounding.  OK So now you have a problem with me I guess?  Any way, if she is working here the next time I come, I will not be staying.  Shouldn't treat people this way."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this location. I like the set up of this locale but not really a big area outside to dance around at like the other locales I've been to and we came about 9pm on a Saturday night and I was oddly surprised to have seen such an 'older' crowd for lack of better words at this bar. I mean granted still a lil early I suppose but a very large group of older people that night. The service was good though, I will admit. We ended back there Sunday morning for brunch, and to my surprise it was a great cure to a very 'hot mess' of a night. And if you're a bloody Mary fan, they have $3 build your own on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Looks like a great place, and probably is for hanging out and having some drinks with friends.  For lunch or dinner - I would pass!  The positives:  Good drinks/cocktails. The negatives: Kids eat free every day however the waitress tried to charged us for two kids meals.  My son's milk was sour.  The cheese on the nachos was poured (cheese sauce) on instead of melted on.  The plate was super hot when the waitress put it in front of him.  The rice and beans tasted like they came from a can......I think you get the point."}
{"text":"Not the best Dos, but not the worst.  The food is good. Two words: taco specials. Mixed drinks are meh, except for their margs. Huge patio.  Every time weve gone here for HH lately, their live music has been way too loud. That mixed w/ people playing (and losing) red neck oversized Jenga, dont make for a good place to talk to the people youre hanging out w/."}
{"text":"I have a blast evertime I go to Dos. The ONLY downfall for me is the DJ plays the same music everytime! Seriously has the same playlist and ive asked him to play certain songs and he says he will.....buuuut doesnt . I know alot of people who go there and say the same! So listen up owners.......add more music!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe a suggestion box or ballot forms ? We buy a drink, we get to pick a song! just a thought"}
{"text":"Erin, brittany, Chris vella, Alexander Washington, and dez taylor have consistently delivered such a high level of customer service individually and as a group when we bring parties to dos gringos Tempe that this is my friends and I first choice when we elect to eat GREAT food, drinks, and have an overall friendly and inviting atmosphere. Each time I walk in my expectations are exceeded. I can't say enough great things about this location."}
{"text":"I had the supergooeycheesy chimichanga. It was delicious! Best ever. The service was fast and friendly. We will definitely be coming back. We sat out on the patio. Lots of people and a nice atmosphere. If you prefer peace and quiet you probably wouldn't like it. It's a typical bar atmosphere. Nice to unwind with a drink though."}
{"text":"Dos gringos is always good for taco Tuesday! I've been to all locations and have had decent experiences at all  Tempe location is definitely my favorite. They tacos and burritos are my favorite. Margaritas are mediocre but it's a fun, relaxed place! They have big Jenga which I always look forward to playing- even better, they have corn hole!"}
{"text":"Horrrrible service but I like the tacos and bean and cheese burrito - it's good every once in a while bc I like the environment. If they service was better I'd give a better star reading! It still doesn't keep me from coming here!"}
{"text":"Had previously gone to this restaurant despite of the reviews and I had a pretty good experience. I tried to go back again and it was absolutely terrible, I had to go get my own menu and even after that, the girls that work there walked by our table twice to check on their customers and didn't even ask it we needed anything, so after 30 minutes of waiting and no service we decided to leave."}
{"text":"During my five-day stay in Tempe/Phoenix, I honestly did not have a single bad meal.  Every restaurant and coffee joint I stopped at gave me great experiences.  I wanted to end my trip out to Arizona with a good dinner, and I found myself at Dos Gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west.  Honestly, the name sold me pretty quickly.  Obviously, I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos, but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man, it sounded like a good place to experience.  Despite it being chilly at night now this time of year, it was still an experience upon arrival.  It's like the tacky, somewhat tasteless, lampooned Mexican version of TGI Fridays, with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls, and a whole lot of hand-painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year-olds chuckle and appreciate.  The parking was free and plentiful, and I'm always a fan of the grungy, Christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor; my kind of style for relaxation and no-nonsense.  There were TVs everywhere, which was nice to watch some Sunday Night Football in the process, and I sat wherever I pleased.  Service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order, deliver my beer, and bring my food when it was ready.  I ordered an enchilada, and two \"street\" tacos, which were corn tortilla apparently.  Don't take my word for it, being an uneducated in Mexican food, east coaster, but I thought it was great.  Definitely different than the kind of \"Mexican\" food I can get in Atlanta.  Overall, I can't say that I had a bad experience.  The food was filling, not really expensive, and tasty to my tastebuds.  Beer, football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile, and I can't complain.  Solid, adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area."}
{"text":"I am Hispanic, and my husband knows how to cook authentic Mexican food. Both of us have worked in the restaurant industry. We have both been to Mexico multiple times. When we want Mexican food, this is one of our spots.   At lunch, the service isn't speedy, but it's not super slow either. They could use more waitresses. The chips and salsa are respectable, not the very best, but good.   The crunchy chicken tacos are literally the best I've ever had. They put guacamole in them, which I've never seen before, and they're delicious. My husband always orders the chimichanga special and he raves about it.   It's kid-friendly too, which is hard to find when you want decent food but can't find a sitter. Our young kids like the games and atmosphere. And I suppose it can be said that dudes would like this place as there are thin young women in tank tops and daisy dukes prancing around. They don't look TOO tacky, but it's a bit more butt cheek than my 13 year old stepson needs to see."}
{"text":"I returned to DOS GRINGOS MESA only to be highly offended and disgusted, The first time I went the Margaritas were awesome, this time THEY WERE SO HORRIBLE! They had a comedy night which was so horrid, and annoying! I will never revisit this bar again!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit bias due to my Oregon Ducks backing, but like all Duck fans, I just don't give a shit.  Unreal, and I mean unreal service...  We were at the same table all night and must have had 5 separate waiters/waitresses check on us.    Great Margaritas and Bloodies, the best Chicken Wings in Scottsdale and a crazy bar menu.  The College Football bar specials on Saturdays are off the charts, especially if you \"Love My Ducks.\"  Great bar, great food, unreal service.-"}
{"text":"We love their Salsa and chips and drinks for Happy Hour...well, I mean the beer for happy hour.  Their home-made margaritas are not good at all.  I really wish they would swtich to frozen margaritas ouf of those machines.  We always get excellent service when we go - it's a nice place!"}
{"text":"Super expensive for mediocre bland (can you believe it from a Mexican place) food. Now that the minimum wage went up, they no longer offer free kids meals (which they used to at all times with the purchase of an entree) which really makes you notice how expensive everything else is. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Berlin is the best. She was very obviously new to the job, but we told her our names... she remembered them the entire time, and didn't even mind that 4 people came in for just 2 margaritas and a couple of sodas. They are sticklers about their 10pm start time for reverse happy hour, but otherwise... a great place to relax, unwind, and people watch."}
{"text":"Hearing the name Dos Gringos just makes me want to day drink. I love coming here. First of all, I love patios and they have a huge one downstairs and also one upstairs (I rarely go up there though). I have probably only sat INSIDE a handful of times here. They have lots of good specials, they have giant Jenga, a couple different bars, a really good Thursday night special, etc. It's jus a fun place. We used to come here on Thursdays and get the wristband and get 50 cent Coronas or whatever the deal was and it would get PACKED and be a blast. The food is your basic bar food, pretty good if you're just grabbing some nachos for the table or grabbing a couple of tacos. It's fun at night but it's better (in my opinion) for some good old day drinking. Service has always been good and the servers have been friendly."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while and, besides having expanded to include the neighboring building, it hasn't changed much. The service is generally bad, the tacos are good, the picnic tables feel dirty, and it's an okay place to stop in for a beer."}
{"text":"Came to watch a basketball game and food bc it was pretty close to home and had alright reviews.. We had spicy queso dip for appetizer, street tacos (ground beef & grilled steak) and seafood tacos (shrimp & beer battered mahi) w rice and beans & house margarita w Silver Patron. Seriously, only reason we ate anything past the appetizer was bc we were hungry. To start, there's no denying beans were straight from a can- nasty! Rice was bland and tasted old. Tacos all together were no good. Seafood tacos: flavors just did not go together at all! Everything else was bland- even the margarita :(, I left with a stomach ache and let's just say I'll never go again. I would've had a better chance at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I fell somewhere in the middle, service was good and friendly, the food was okay not the worst nor the best if eaten, but for a quick lunch.... It worked! Fair, is a fair assessment! So therefore the ."}
{"text":"This review is only for their nachos. This place is very close to where I work. More often than not, I'm pressed for time. I will call in my nacho order and swing by and pick them up. I'm a huge nacho fan and would go as far as to say I'm a nacho connoisseur. You can add chicken or beef to your nachos. I personally like the chicken, but add whatever you like. It's your journey. Swing by and try some or if you're like me and are pressed for time, call them in! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Has potential, but 110db (about as loud as a jet taking off)  headbanger music chosen by a 15 year old and very poorly prepared food make this non-Mexican food joint hard to recommend.  Avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"It is a little divey and grimy but I say that in the highest regards. Tons of patio space and decked out in bright colors. Had some cervesas and cuba libres (rum and coke but add a lime and it is called a cuba libre).   We ordered the chimichangas and my two friends swear that it was sprinkled with crack and that it was the best they have ever tasted. I cannot vouch as I was intoxicated and as long as it had cheese on it, I was shoveling it into my mouth without regard to taste. We will be back when we are in the neighborhood and are in the mood for a late night menu while drinking."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos reminds me of a gross, Cancun-themed college bar that should be located in Lubbock, Texas. Someplace where the patrons have never been to and may not have heard of Cancun or the Yucatan Peninsula. But this place is in Scottsdale?  Atmosphere: Yellow and green everything. Everything. Also, I love a mister, especially in the summertime. Yet, this place needs to cool it on the misters. Everything is wet. The only feeling that arises is a negative feeling-- akin to the negative connotations that arise in some people when you say the words \"moist\" or \"used.\"  Service: Okay? I guess? Different employees brought us our menus, drinks, and food, plus different people to take the orders of drinks and food. I'm not really sure who I tipped. There was a mistake on our bill, so we flagged down a waitress. She took off the mistake, with a smile, and told us that one of the servers was new-- so mistakes sometimes happen. (Plus one star for customer service)  Drinks: Watered down margaritas. I'm glad we were there at happy hour ($3 for a house marg). I don't think I could pay full price for a house margarita. Other drinks on the bar menu looked good, but I will not be back to try them.  Food: We ordered queso, a breakfast burrito, and a bean burrito. The queso was high school concession stand nacho cheese in a cast iron mini-skillet. Nasty. My designated restaurant buddy got the breakfast burrito, which he thought was great for $5.  I wish I could say the same for my burrito. Bean and cheese sounds pretty plain, but you must understand that I did not want to risk my digestive track in a place that looked like the worst of Cancun. To spice things up, I added guac to my burrito. Something the menu stated would be a $0.99 upgrade-- fine by me. When the order came out, the guac side was huge. Score! I gobbled that delicious guacamole up. Yum. When the bill came, I found out the guac was $2.99. Oh. One of the waiters explained that $2.99 was the price for a side of guac. Oh. Thanks, Dos Gringos.   TL;DR Dos Gringos' spring break died ten years ago, but no one told Dos. Yuck."}
{"text":"Do you miss college?!?!! DO YOU REMEMBER COLLEGE? Well then.. go here.. because... it's like college but worse. Because suddenly you're older and you're looking at a bunch of kids and a bunch of old people.. and it's awkward and creepy and the guy selling cigarettes ignored me?! WTF? Very odd mix of people. But entertaining to laugh at people."}
{"text":"Ah, Dos.  The old standby. For the last 9 years, it has always been our backup plan when we wanted to escape the newest pretentious old town Scottsdale club.   \"I'm bored. And my drink was $10.\"  \"What do you want to do?\" \"I dunno. What do you want to do?\" \"Let's go to Dos.\" \"Okay!\"  Instantly a mood changer. Cheap drinks, rowdy people, good mix of music. Service is inconsistent. One night it can be great, the next night you can have a total a-hole bartender. Some of my guy friends have had issues with the bouncers.   Food isn't the greatest but it tastes pretty good when it is 1:30 am and you know your only other choice is a long line at a fast food place. Gringo rolls are my favorite.   Great place for the young and the single. My girlfriends and I would have quite the time here before we all became married old ladies."}
{"text":"Overall this place was fun.  I was in on vacation and like most out of towners I assume, my friends brought me here.  It was a good choice because it's one of those atmosphere's where you're pretty much sure to have a good time.  I did notice the d-bags in their man blouses and all the fake/plastic chicks, but not enough to care.  When I move to Phoenix, I'm sure we'll be back, but I won't be frequenting this place every weekend."}
{"text":"When we arrived we sat ourselves it was pretty busy on the patio. We were there for a birthday celebration. The service was terrible we had to walk up to the bar to order drinks and flag down a waitress to give us menus to take our food order 45 minutes later. Lemon drop shot tasted nasty for 7.00 wasnt worth the tsp of liquor in the huge shot glass. We then tried amf's ( 8.00) while the first round was good the 2nd and  3rd were too sweet and didnt taste like the first. My friend asked if the bartender could re make her drink and the bar tender manager that was making the drinks i believe her name is miranda got rude and upset. Said shes remade the drink 3 times and that we had 30 minutes to finish what drinks we had. What she didnt know is the drinks were for individual people but didnt bother to ask. And had a bouncer of a bar come and stand by our tables and watch the clock till our time ran out to make sure we would leave. When sitting there with a group of people for 3+ hours and then asking why the drink is now tasting too sweet and not like the first ones you ordered and being asked to leave obviously your customer is never right. While we were told to take up our complaint with manager joey of the store we decided it wasnt worth our time as we will find a new place to celebrate with our family and friends on birthday occasions and take our money elsewhere. My advice for the cost of drinks and the not so awesome service go someplace else."}
{"text":"Dos in Old Town is a laid back day drinking /  happy hour / evening spot in where you dont have to be pretentious, a bro, done up, or out to 'pick up' someone to go. You can just go, eat, drink,  dance, have fun without any of the Old Town rules or boundaries or cultural faux paus.   Dos is fun because it knows what it is and accepts it well. If you want to just sit and chill and drink, do it! If you want some tacos or nachos and some beers. BOOM! If you want to go out on a Saturday night and 'just dance' without 10,000 other dudes all up ons you, then good; Dos is good for that.   Food: Food is meh. Bar food, mexican taquiera style, but certainly not 'good'. The drinks are your typical bar drinks, no fancy menu drink menu. Not that type of place. You typically end up getting a bucket Dos Equis Lagers and there ain't nothing wrong with that.  I like going to Dos and i'm sure i'll be back time and time again, especially on nights where the bro status across Scottsdale Rd gets to be so high I can't take it...."}
{"text":"We held a corporate happy hour event here, and it was a total success. Doug and his team were extremely accommodating and quick to answer any questions I had in preparing for our event. I chose this venue over others simply because of how attentive and passionate Doug was.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place more stars if they hadn't of changed their menu. They used to have Gringo tacos and those were DELICIOUS but now they have a menu that would compare to any shabby filibertos. Also it's very hard to find a server and when you walk in you just kind of stand there for a while because no one ever knows whether they seat you or you seat yourself. Also wouldn't call this a family friendly area either, everyone that comes here usually ends up drunk"}
{"text":"Happy hour on a Friday was very busy. Good margaritas, chips and salsa and steak tacos. Family friendly during the day for a quick bite. I would go back for lunch, dinner and to hang out."}
{"text":"Smell of this place reminds me of a camping site near the outhouse. Food was so-so, not very fresh. Customer service was lacking as well."}
{"text":"fun place to dance.. 3.50 beers and 4.50 beers.. roughly 5 for mix drinks... not horrible not great."}
{"text":"It is what it is: a hot mess.  But fun.  This is a place you go to if you've been drinking awhile, or you plan on drinking alot. ;)  Multi leveled, indoor/outdoor venue, tons of tvs and a vast space.  The atmosphere is laid back and is lit up with lights to the point you feel like you're back in Tijuana. This is a great place if you know what you're in for and if you have a sense of humor.  Fancy/upscale? Definitely not.  Uptight and pretentious? not at all.  Go with a sense of humor and know you can get cheap drinks and watch some drunk ass people act a fool..."}
{"text":"Green chile dip looked like a baby threw up on a plate then they just put a dollop of sour cream, chips on the side and charged $10 for it. Service was slow. $6 Margaritas served in small plastic disposable cups. Steer clear of this train wreck."}
{"text":"Did gringos itself has great food. Than being said that's all they have. Been twice to the same location and both times been walked by by several waiters and waitresses without being helped for about 20-25 minutes.  The place is not crowded or full whatsoever so I'm not sure as to why the wait was so long while others where being served around me.   I gave it a second chance because the food was good but  I won't be coming back after the same service and no change. Both visits about a month apart.  Like I said they have good tacos and that's it."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Saturday night. I got there around 8pm and there was a good crowd already. We managed to get a table right next to the heaters because it was one of the few spots with one. The waiter was attentive and the crowd was pleasant. As soon as it was 10pm, the crowd got fairly large, and the waiter still came around often. I was impressed! The only problem I had was the drinks were on the watered down side... I like a little more Jack with my Coke."}
{"text":"Love Dos Gringos for happy hour. Great drink specials and happy hour entres are just a few bucks. Get the chips with the sloppy 7 layer dip!! So good."}
{"text":"Came in to have a couple of drinks and the guy at the counter told me that he doesn't feel comfortable because I was on a bike and there was  like 12 other bikes parked out front I think it was discrimination against Latinos on bikes and i told the manager i was going to write against this on yelp and they said they were going to write against my business alberts garage general auto repair  7 days a week for me being there. That is not right. Well here it is chris. Live up to it. There were more fkdup people walking in that place that had more liabilities like you wouldn't  believe. That place itself is a liability. You want to trash my business because i want to have a couple of drinks bring it on. You can find my number on google"}
{"text":"Went with a group of about 10 and had a great time.  Service was pretty good, restrooms were clean and well stocked (yes, this is always something I consider while reviewing), and the heaters were working perfectly.    One funny thing was that my friend ordered a round of shots for the group and the chick taking his order says \"What is that?  What's in it?\" and he states \"Just tell the Bartender, they'll know\".  In a rude tone with a rude face she says, \"I am the Bartender.\"  Go look it up then sweetie.  All in all, a fun night with friends at one of the cooler Scottsdale bars I've been to."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE, they will charge your credit card more than what you approve and then try it cover it up. Even the general manager is in on it trying to fraudulently charge people, the service is terrible. It's definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Been going here since they first opened. Love this place. Just got back to Scottsdale after being in California for 10 years and it has grown but maintained it's core vibe. Beachy, dive like and good food and service.  Will definitely be there numerous times while in Arizona.  John the bartender is great!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a bit of an off night during the week. It wasn't too busy but I could definitely tell this is one of those wild places to go on the weekends.... you know what I am talking about. Big, lots of rooms, smells of booze soaked into the wood floors...yeah that.  Luckily since it was during the week they had some really cheap Coronas. I also had the steak fajitas. They were surprisingly very good.. I was expecting a bit on the meh side considering this is more of a party place. They also had a desert that was nearly mind blowing. They wrap cookie dough in a chocolate tortilla and then deep fry it..and then its server with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. If you are on a diet this is the PERFECT thing to screw it up with, and its damn good haha.  The service was pretty solid, it was just the bartender running the tables. Since I was near the bar it was easy to flag him down if I wanted something. Hopefully I will be back on a weekend sometime to see how crazy this place really gets!"}
{"text":"It's a typical bar. Good happy hour and late night specials though. Service could always be better, but that's true of most Dos bars. What brings us back to this one is the location, the food, and the cheap drinks. Oh, and the gigantic Jenga blocks or cornhole keeps the evening fun too.  There are DJs on some nights and every Thursday is ladies night, so the ladies get a special discount on drinks."}
{"text":"Must try the gringo burro!!! It's the best! The street tacos are really good as well. I try to get something new every time and I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio of the Mesa Dos Gringo location and was.... wah wah wah... not impressed (big surprise, it's MESA ;)). To keep it brief, I'm compiling two lists, what I liked and what I didn't. Bad news first.  BAD: -misters were on full blast. We were seated for about an hour and everything was DRENCHED: my purse, our clothes, our hair, the table. I can't imagine eating a meal out here because it would just be soggy... I suppose the misters are really great for keeping things cool, but not when you're just sitting and hanging out. It's like sitting poolside at Sea World. -loud, but not in a fun party way. Loud like, people playing Redneck Jenga and blocks scattering in a million directions. Loud like, some random drunk 50-something hitting on the bartender from across the patio and making everyone cringe. I dunno, does anyone else get what I'm saying. When it's loud and everyone's having fun, it's not weird. This was weird. -on Saturdays they don't have reverse drink specials, so happy hour ends at 6 or whatever.  -to the weird ICP Juggalo people who were sitting nearby. Really? I'm sorry, this just became incredibly awkward.  GOOD: -waitress was nice, she allowed my friend to flirt with her and was a good sport about it without encouraging the poor bloke. She brought us extra drinks before happy hour was over so we wouldn't be charged extra.  -hot waitresses and bartenders for the gentlemen to ogle. I didn't see any men. At all. Oh wait, maybe in the kitchen. But... ew...  As you can see, I just don't really have alot to say about this place... it's just... *shrugs shoulders* mehhh.... I don't think I'll be going back, for food, drinks or otherwise."}
{"text":"It does not get any better than this place, I wish they had a location in the NW Valley but it probably wouldn't be as cool.  I love the casual atmosphere (has a rocky point feel to it) and you usually get good service.  When they are really busy I just get my drinks from the center bar and it is always fast.  It is also not too loud here when you are having a conversation like many other places.  Prices aren't bad either, just my favorite all around bar that seems always to be busy just because it is too cool.  Oh and the food is good too."}
{"text":"The location is great. The service.... not so much. My sister and I went on a weekday night and it was not busy at all. We ordered our drinks and then our food. We had two other people meeting us there but did not tell them because we wanted to eat right away. Once the other two showed up (guys) she was back to our table to help. She was very attentive with them and they even got their food before we did. I never got a refill on my tea and my one of the guys never got the drink he actually ordered. She ordered a vodka and cran and she brought him out a beer. She apologized and offered it to him on her and she would go grab his drink.... she never did. My sister ordered a queso dip and asked for more chips.... the chips never came until we asked another server. The food was good the location is nice the seating is great but the service isn't tremendious. I would go back, just hopefully get a different server."}
{"text":"I don't get it... I feel like I missed the memo.  Food is aweful- I don't care how drunk you get, you'll still know it stinks!  Rainy day margarita is my one good memory that I can take away from this place- good times.  Interesting blend of people- old, young, and everywhere in between. Yet, still not the first place I'm willing to go to."}
{"text":"Yummy food and fun place to eat, but make sure it's at the bar. The servers suck and check in every 15-20 minutes and don't care to smile or take care of you. We waited 10 minutes at our tables before we were helped. The bartender chuck is Amazing and always provides the best service!!!   *alex or aleyx (pronounced a-lex) was our server and we asked for all flour tacos-we later learned these are gringo style- and she gave us street style. I asked her if we could get the correct tacos and she said we ordered flour which is only flour, meat and onions. We went to the bartender, chuck, and asked and he said that gringo was flour with cheese, pico, meat and jalapeño salsa. Later she went up to him saying we ordered street style, which I know for 100% fact that we did not because I ALWAYS order flour tacos and they always come fully loaded. Bartender fixed it right away and left us happy customers!"}
{"text":"College bar mixed with a Squid Row vibe.  High energy and PBR on tap.  Bonus for the 50 yr old dude macking on the 20 yr old chica with mad success."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is a nice option for outdoor seating drinks with friends but they need to step up their game. Almost half of the outdoor heaters are broken, there isn't great light and it just kind of feels dirty. The only server walking around seemed to be the Jello Shot girl. That being said, we went and had a nice time thanks to the great service of Tyler and choice mixes from the onsite dj. Opening up the floor to dancing or having a karaoke night would set this place apart. There's a lot of space there that could be used for some good times."}
{"text":"Honestly I really like this place and always have for about 10 yrs... Thing is... In the last few years they have lost their hott female bartenders and incredibly raised the prices I think? A shot of soco lime is 7 bucks some how.. The same as a grape bomber.. Both of which are high priced in Scottsdale. The place has decent food but totally lost there real following due to over pricing. Welcome to capital inflation without representation.. I also remember when they did fun stuff almost everyday and posted it on the chalk wall in the men's bathroom..."}
{"text":"We were walking around town and decided to stop here for a drink. It was the loud music that attracted us here. It was actually a live DJ with a drummer playing decent music. The outside patio was kind of dead, so after our $3 well drink, we decided to move on (yes, $3!!! amazing!)"}
{"text":"Very mediocre Mexican food, but good service.  Coming from a place called Dos Gringos, you have to expect nothing but gringo-y type food though.  I had the gringo burrito, which had a lot of meat, veggie, and black beans in it.  It also came with rice and beans.  Everything in the dish was very bland though, and I had to smother everything in Tapatio hot sauce for there to have any flavor.  Despite having some communication difficulties since it was hard to hear each other speak (We were outside on the patio at a table and a live band was playing), our waitress did a good job refilling drinks as needed and getting our orders in.  I would probably only go here again if a good band is playing here, but I wouldn't go here solely for the food.  By the way, the outdoor Jenga blocks are pretty cool.  We made a tower of 29 levels of blocks, but unfortunately did not beat the record of 34!"}
{"text":"Dos Gringos a nice play to go to get some drinks and happy hour. The food is good, but it's nothing that will stand out to you. They have a nice atmosphere and everyone is really friendly. TVs are everywhere and the patio is very nice especially at the right time of the year."}
{"text":"Went for the first time,and was very disappointed in the experience. I ordered a beer,and it was served at room temperature. The bar looks very run down with no attention to cleanliness. The food was ok, nothing to impressive. I wil def not be returning back again."}
{"text":"Last Wednesday we decided to go for a cocktail after work. They weren't very busy, maybe 20 people total. We sat at a table right next to the bar and waited about five minutes without being acknowledged. We ended up going up to the bar to order drinks and we each got an appetizer, mini chimis. We sat back down and about ten minutes later, someone brought out our appetizers, set them down on the bar, and walked away. We sat there for about five minutes waiting for the bartender or a waitress to bring them to our table. Again, had to get up to go get them ourselves. My husband ate the mini chimis but not the shredded lettuce and tomato garnish that came with it. I ate the chimis and the garnish. Excruciating stomach cramps are what woke me up on Thursday morning. I was sick until Saturday. My guess is that the shredded lettuce hadn't been washed properly and sat there, probably in a little puddle of water in the bottom of a container, stewing in bacteria, before they put it on the plate. My bad for eating the garnish, I probably should have known better, but regardless, I'll never eat there again. The place's cleanliness already looks a little questionable, but this sealed the deal."}
{"text":"My husband and I called before to verify their kids eat free every day offer and the person on the phone said they still offer this.  When we got the bill we had to have the waitress reprint the bill less our two kids free meals.  She said thy no longer are doing this or advertising this but still offer it to people who have known about it during previous trips there.  We won't be going back though, not because of the kids eat free confusion but because the fish tacos I had were over battered and greasy. The oil was not hot enough when the fish was fried so the batter was heavy with oil and tasted old.  The corn tortillas were thin and didn't fry up soft like \"street style\" are supposed to be. Just heated up warm and fresh would have been much better. My husband was not impressed with his steak tacos. No fresh limes came with them either. I guess we could have asked for them but we didn't bother.  As for the \"Good For Kids:  Yes\" rating I would have to say not really.  This place seemed more like a \"pub\" than a \"grill.\" - reminded me of somewhere I got two for one Coronas and a free shot of tequila in Tijuana when I was in my twenties!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to get wasted and dance to some rap then dos is your place (at least in Chandler). Otherwise keep on walking.   I'm a craft beer/wine bar kind of person. For me it's:  -too loud -filled with smoke  -a minimal tap list -mediocre service"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat and some marg's when visiting family.  This is definitely NOT the place to go for authentic Mexican food or high-quality drink.  The scantily clad bar staff make this feel like a college hang out.  Everything was average, fair, mediocre, middle of the road.  Nothing special, exciting or unique here.  Just a fun place to hang out and drink with friends."}
{"text":"I have lived in the greater Phoenix area and been to every Dos Gringo's in the valley, I like them all. The South Tempe location however, has the best staff by far. The staff, BOTH male and female are friendly, professional, and take their jobs seriously. The food is good and on par with what offerings a place like this would have. Obviously a large part of the place is the drinks, and the bartenders are always quick to keep your glass full of whatever you want. They will even try to make anything you request as long as they have the ingredients. Overall, I have no complaints and would gladly bring friends and family here and I will be back. Would definitely have to disagree with the overly critical reviews below. Some almost sound personal...  Favorite Food items:  Surf and Turf Salad/Wrap Mini Chimis Gringo Rolls Tacos Anything with Carne Asada or seafood."}
{"text":"I've been to the Chandler location a few times for lunch and I really enjoyed it. Chips and Salsa were good, food was good and my iced tea was good.. I was disappointed with the Scottsdale location. The food wasn't as good, my tacos were bland (I poured all of my salsa on them for flavor.) My margarita tasted like dish soap (I only drank a 1/4 of it and no one asked why I wasn't drinking it) My iced tea was thick and seemed like it was week old iced tea, I didn't drink it and no one bothered to ask why I my drinks were still full. I feel like I threw away money by going there. I won't be going back. But if you like a loud atmosphere and watered down drinks then that might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Rice tasted uncooked. Street tacos were not very good. The waitress was not very attentive. I will never eat at this place again. The only decent thing was the beer. It came in a bottle."}
{"text":"\"A Good Place To Day Drink\" as their motto goes, and never look back.  A popular destination for locals and visitors for spring training games, you'll always find the place crowded. The place is mostly outdoors so not the best place in a rain storm. The giant game of Jenga, made with 2 by 4 pieces of wood is very entertaining with drunk people playing. The food is pretty good. The nachos always hit the spot especially after you've been drinking. It's not the classiest place in Scottsdale, but its a good place to go and have fun with your friends.  Dos Gringos is always part of the Scottsdale Block Party during New Years, so when that time of the year comes around, it is an affordable and fun choice."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if I could.   We waited literally TWO HOURS and didn't get our meal.   We arrived at 7 p.m. The waiter told us the kitchen was backed up when we sat down. We were okay with that. He brought us our drinks and chips, and we ordered some one dollar tacos. The tacos took an hour to arrive and were not worth the wait.   My husband and I ordered a combination plate to share. It never came! We asked the waiter about our food and he said it was coming. We waited until 9 p.m. and finally gave up. We went home without dinner.   DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a large range in reviews! It's not a bad bar but it's not the best thing in the world. Because of the location I feel it attracts an older crowd and yes even families. The food here is decent so I noticed quite a few people come here to just eat, on their special nights like taco Tuesdays. During the week it's an older crowd and people are there to eat, on the weekends the younger crowd rolls in and it's more of a bar than a place to eat. The food is decent, it's a bar serving Mexican food so you have to keep that in mind, its not going to be authentic. They have a few different drink specials, more beer specials than anything; unfortunately the mixed drinks are mediocre and are pretty pricey. The set up is pretty cool for they have a big open patio with a bar, a Corn Hole game set up, Jenga stations and pool tables. If you get there early on the weekend you can snag the back corner inside and it has a little private area for beer pong, Jenga and a little bar right next to you, kind of perfect for a group of friends. The staff is always friendly and quick with drinks and food orders. In the end its A-OK by me if your looking for just a place to chill."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We were passed by the same waitress a dozen times and no service, when we tried to get her attention we were rudely told not now. This is a big hang out for Michigan fans and I'm wondering why with lack of service."}
{"text":"This place is near my boyfriend's house, so we found ourselves ending our days there on the patio. We were there during the week so it was never crazy packed, but there was a good crowd of people. They have good drink specials, and the burrito I had there was pretty bomb. I'll definitely be back, plus this one looks a lot classier than the one in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great for drinking beers and happy hour. Good chips and salsa. The service was poor. The waitress didn't know a lot of things and couldn't answer questions. Bummed the restaurant wouldn't let us do a liberty shot. I would come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Dishonest thieves. This place is terrible. I left a pair of $150 Oakley's here during the day. I called an hour later and they said they found them. By the time I made it down there to pick them up they were gone, despite being stored where only employees have access.   I sent numerous complaints to corporate and to the manager. Corporate completely ignored me. The manager said he would ask the employees but never would respond back to me. They didn't even offer to pay for the sunglasses their employees stole. Not an offer for free food. Terrible, dishonest business."}
{"text":"Great bartenders (Joey) and excellent $5 breakfast burrito (get it w a side of habanero).  Has chorizo!  Love the $3 build your own Bloody Mary bar! Several kinds of olives, plus jalapeños, onions, carrots, celery, zucchini, hot sauces, celery salt, etc.   Huge, Dog friendly patio with air conditioners and heaters at each table/bar seat."}
{"text":"Went here for a few drinks and dinner with coworkers... on a Monday. It was empty, and the service was pre-occupied with some game, but I didn't mind since I took my sweet ass time ordering.   Beers were hella cheap, and the food was palatable. I'd go back if I were looking for a place to drink first, eat second."}
{"text":"I've always loved Dos Gringos, from the old one I would frequent in Tempe to this location we pre-game at during kickball season. They have big open patios perfect for sipping on Coronas and they've got decent Bloody Mary bars on Sundays.   The Carne tacos are cheap and delicious, and they have crazy specials during games. This is a great place for groups or lazy day drinking."}
{"text":"Not a good place to go, food was poorly made, no seasonings, no flavor! Never got our drinks refilled!  Will not go back!"}
{"text":"Dive bar with cheap drinks.....downtown scottsdale is cute  D"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying, NEVER GO TO A MEXICAN RESAURANT CALLED DOS GRINGOS(Spanish for two white guys)!!!  It's plain and simple a bar.  We walked in and were greeted by an outdoor area where music was blaring.  There was birdpoop on the floor and benches!!! We had to ask 3 servers before one finally told us that we can sit wherever we want.  All around us people were smoking and drinking shot after shot.  And the servers were even worse!!! They were all girls walking around in practically bikinis!!! We had to ask FOUR different ladies for just a side of beans before one finally understood our request.  In the middle of our \"dinner\", we heard yelling and realized that just feet away from our table-with children-, the bartender and a bunch of customers were playing bar games!!! Completely inappropriate for a so called \"family environment\"!!!  Why have a kid menu?  With the food, we had to ask about pretty much everything because the menu was very confusing(half of the FOOD menu was a tequila menu!).  Half of my table had to order something else after finishing eating because the serving sizes are ridiculous( and the food was terrible)!!!  We all left starving with smoke in our nostrils. If you want to party at the bar, go here.  If you wan Mexican food, or have children, find somewhere else!"}
{"text":"They have great service, and awesome food and drink prices. The staff is very friendly and the environment there is awesome. You feel like you've stepped into a different world. And what makes this place even better is that it's a Duck bar during college football season, GO DUCKS! This is were they Oregon alumni gather to watch games, the bar reserves tables for duck fans and they offer food and drink specials during the games."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! This time of year is the best for outdoor eating. The staff is friendly,  and the food is great. try the gringo burro, it is manly and tasty. wash it down with a house margarita, and you are set. house dj rulez!"}
{"text":"Always a good time at dos gringos...loud and crazy"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, and the atmosphere was fun. Portions are large, and price is comparable to other places around town. Service was quick and friendly. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Don't really have a problem with the food, it is just very average. The service was a little on the slow side, especially for such a SLOW night. There were literally only three tables inside with customers. The bar was a little busy, and therein lies the problem. This must be one of the last great frontiers for smokers. Although it is legal to smoke on an outside patio technically, what is not OK is to let the smoke and nasty smell waft in through the open doors constantly, ruining your quiet enjoyment of your meal. We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today, part of a corporate event. Have to say I was underwhelmed, to put it lightly.   The layout is fun, different and definitely \"dive bar\" style, which is fine by me, but man talk about having service issues. The downhill slide started as soon as our group started to trickle in and we inquired about accommodations that were supposedly arranged in advance. What happens? We get ye old \"Nobody told me anything about a group,\" response. Good to know they're on top of this stuff. I was under the impression that during a slow day they would be more than happy to have our large group bring them some business, but apparently it wasn't worth keeping track of.   Secondly, for being completely empty, it took way too long to get drink service at our tables. Refills also took way too long. We were within 6 feet of the bar, so you have to understand that there was no excuse for anyone to run dry, but they did. Repeatedly.   Thirdly, the food service was abysmal. Ordered one appetizer, it comes out and we share. No plates to eat with, apparently that wasn't doable. What's worse, we ordered our main dishes and requested an additional appetizer to share. When does it come out? After the main dishes. What the hell? And for that matter, the main entrees came out way, way later than what was reasonable. The excuse from the server? \"I staggered the orders for your multiple tables,\" or some such nonsense. Yeah buddy, we came here together but we all wanted to eat 20 minutes apart, that totally makes sense. Salt in the wound, the appetizer in question, their quesadilla, was basically two store-bought flour tortillas with cheese in between, nuked in a microwave. Oily, limp, and not a single portion of crispiness to be found anywhere. How do you call this a quesadilla? Wet noddle-ish tortillas with cheese inside might be more apt. Gross.   It doesn't stop there. The entire meal, the food quality was under par. Take the cheese dip first, which was basically soup consistency and pretty gross. It tasted spicy, but it didn't really taste like cheese. Yuck. Or the rice that came with the entrees -bland, stale and cold too. Felt like something cooked a few days ago, reheated and allowed to cool before being served. Seriously. The entree, a chimichanga, was way over fried, and while the meat was good, it was a gut bomb.   On the whole, I'm just not impressed. Food quality was basically crap, even by bar-food standards. Service was definitely crap, even by bar standards. I honestly love the layout, it's different and fun and enjoyable for larger groups and corporate team building, but you need more than layout to get me back in the door. I'm disappointed and I didn't pay a dime since it was on the company's card. I still wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Came here about 7:30 on a Saturday night. Surprisingly it was pretty dead. We walked right in and sat right down. We  were only one of the two occupied tables in the indoor section. However, that's where the good stopped. Very poor service tonight. After we placed our drink orders for water I think we were forgotten about. Finally when the waitress came back with our drinks we placed an order for an appetizer of fries and our dinner orders which were simple tacos. After a wait our dinner came but no appetizer. The waitress said she would go check on it. When our dinner was almost finished she finally came back and said that they were out of fries. We did not have any napkins, silverware, or refills on our water. In fact, aside from the waitress telling us, practically post-meal, that they were out of our appetizer we weren't checked on at all.     Very disappointed here. This was our second time here. Our first time was excellent, so not sure which time was a fluke. Not sure I'll give them another chance to find out."}
{"text":"Came here recently on a Sunday for the infamous $3.99 Bloody Marys and $7.99 Buffet Brunch. Heard it was the place to be on a Sunday. I have to agree that others find this the hot spot but I truly doubt it's for the buffet. I think the buffet was poorly done. No variety and certainly not filling. You would have to order off the full menu to get rid of your hunger pains. Or eat at home and spend your money on the Bloody Marys. I love a good Bloody Mary bar, who doesn't?! They have every conceivable ingredient you could add to your drink. In fact, the bar had more appetizing garnishes than the buffet table. My only complaint is that they give you very little vodka and fill the glass with too much ice you can't throw a lot of ingredients into the cup.  The TVs are great for the sports fans and the patio is perfect when it's not 90 degrees.  Our waiter was pretty accommodating considering our group kept growing by the hour. He was great about charging the correct items to the correct tabs. Kudos for that!  Check it out when you get a chance. And order off the full menu."}
{"text":"This is the best Dos!  The bartender Chuck is amazing and makes amazing drinks that taste delicious and really sneak up on you. The biggest reason they deserve more than 5 stars is really that they let you bring your dog.. they even bring your dog ICE water.  It is really amazing being able to go somewhere with great food great drinks and an amazing staff and see them treat your dog like a guest as well.  One of the waitresses was even dancing with my dog Sith and really turned an otherwise bad day at work into a really fun worry free night.   I suggest this bar to people almost every day.  It really is a good place to relax even without mans best friend.  Thats just really the vodka soaked cherry on top."}
{"text":"Night before my wedding....tons of folks in town who didnt't want to sit in their hotel rooms and play Yahtzee. I didn't want a stuffy pretentious Scottsdale club and I knew folks wanted to dance. My cousin took me here on a bar hopping night eons ago and I figured this place would be the best spot to go out and not take ourselves too seriously. So my fiance, maid of honor, his best man and a mix of cousins and friends all piled in cabs and headed over.  The place is like Spring Break on acid. Outdoors, several bars, lots of string lights, etc. And yes we were a bit older than their average crowd (early 20 somethings) but we were able to sit at a huge table, talk over our drinks AND dance. How often can you do that at most clubs? Did I mention no dress code? I can wear my flats and actually dance my ass off with no risk of blisters. And of course I'm the only one not hungover this morning. :)"}
{"text":"Went there to watch a hockey playoff game Sunday @ 6:00. Place was not busy and we were seated right away. Waitress came over right away and took our drink order. We ordered the wings and fish tacos. Food was decent and reasonably priced. The place started to fill up. Looks like a lot of regulars. Food was good and priced right. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Is there a word worse than dive bar? Because that's what this place is. Totally disgusting inside and out. At least dive bars tend to have a little charm. They cater to smokers which is blatantly obvious when you arrive. It's 2018, you shouldn't be smoking in the same place that you're eating. The building is totally run down and gross. Tables are sticky and it looks like they haven't dusted in years. They have all of their Best of Phoenix awards hanging on the wall in broken glass frames and (spoiler alert) they haven't won one in over ten years, for good reason. Service is terrible, drinks are weak and food is mediocre at best. The real question is, how are they still in business? We won't be back."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. One of the best patios/places to day-drink in Scottsdale. We went Friday night and ate at the bar and the food was great! Minus 1 star for being an Oregon Ducks bar ;-p"}
{"text":"Got a beer and chips and the beer was really cold and they didn't charge me for the chips.  The salsa was good but could have been just a bit spicier."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to give Dos at least three stars just because it's Dos. I mean did going to Dos make me feel old, yes, were there some interesting people there and not in a good way, yes, did I spend more money than I wanted to, yes, but all in all you always have a great time. Nothin' but laughs. The giant jenga didn't suck either.   Dos Gringos is a staple among the youngins, as I like to call 'em. In college, one will totally fit in, however, now'a days it's a place meant solely for people watching. And boy do you get an eye full.   Drink's are cheap, tacos are good, and the bathrooms aren't as scary as you would think. Go! Have fun, get drunk.... but don't expect anything classy."}
{"text":"I had been in Tempe for two days and hadn't gotten any Mexican food - how is that possible?  So when my friends asked what I wanted for dinner I said \"TACOS!\" and off to Dos Gringos we went.  The food is pretty decent - not the best I've ever had, but I'd certainly go back.  The salsa seemed fresh, and I liked that there was a big variety of meats for the tacos, and you could get them prepared three different ways (gringo, tex mex, and something else that escapes me).    The service was a little flaky, but nothing offensive."}
{"text":"Wow I don't know what to think of this place. I was a bit under the influence of previous jack daniels, when I found myself here. It reminded me of some place that belonged in Lake Havasu. Were there a lot of different rooms and bars? It was a very festive environment."}
{"text":"The best thing about this bar is the drink specials.  After that, the atmosphere and decorations are pleasing while service was average.  The food tasted good but we didn't really try an entire meal."}
{"text":"Only three stars?  Wow--maybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall here--I don't know.  I actually didn't go here myself.  It was my wife.  She brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot--even lukewarm.  All I know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones I've had at taquerias around the tri city area.  Makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot. . .  Okay--challenge accepted.  I'll let you know."}
{"text":"In light of the recent news and video of a Dos Gringos bouncer punching a patron in the face, I thought I should ring in on this establishment....  This bar treats its customers like they are college kids. I suppose they are somewhat justified in this since it is typically a younger crowd. I've had mixed experiences coming here... in the past, I've had acceptable and decent service here, but the last several times I've been there the service has gotten progressively worse. On the last occasion, they took forever to take my drink order and then poured me the wrong drink... then when I went to politely return the full glass of whatever and get what I ordered, they refused to re-make it. I left it on the bar and they threw it away (keeping my money of course) and gave me a dirty look. I also had aggressive bar backs shove me out of the way.   That experience alone was enough for me to never go back, but it wasn't an isolated incident. It wasn't always that way though... The staff in general here all seem to be complete assholes, but I can almost recall a time when they were decent to me - back in the 1990s. It's a pity because this bar is in a great building and has a fun layout. It's breezy and open and conducive to having a good time drinking after work with your buddies. My old roommate used to hit this place often with his corporate pals and he loved the atmosphere. They do make their drinks pretty strong, so maybe he was too trashed to care about the bad service.   In their defense, their patrons are often rowdy, young, and unruly - so that's probably why it has evolved into this. I've found the Tempe location to be more laid back though, so it's still pretty excessive if you ask me. I have to give this place an extra star because it's still a good place for young folks to go grab a beer and chill. I think this punch in the face incident may get them to reevaluate their staff and maybe give them all sensitivity training or something. It can only get better from here."}
{"text":"The wings are awesome!! They have great deal on beer buckets as well! Pool tables? You got it! Great place for happy hour with a bunch of friends.."}
{"text":"This place was just okay to me.  We had a party of four and sat at a picnic table inside. Our server was decent but halfway through the our time there she appeared to be heavily intoxicated.  I was disappointed that they only had one brew on draft. The quesadillas were disgusting, but the mini churros were decent."}
{"text":"Absolutely appalling service!!  My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday.    We got there around 5 pm and the place didn't seem busy at all.  We sat outside at the bar.  Our first bartender was extremely helpful, (15 mins) unfortuneately I didn't get his name.    The second bartender named Ted, (1 hour) was absolutely obnoxious.   He made rude remarks regarding his customers sitting at another table and  he signed my tab without my consent!   Forged my signature!   How awful was It to hear everything coming from his mouth and we're ALL paying customers!   I have been in the restaurant industry for number of years and experienced alot of different bars, and clubs.   I have not been treated soo horrible in my entire life.   Not to mention, he knew it was a friends birthday.    I will NOT go back to Dos Gringos-Scottsdale no matter how good looking the bartenders are."}
{"text":"\"A good old Bar\" Old Town is the location of the original Dos Gringos.  Known for a at home feeling Dos provides great bartenders and a friendly staff.  I go to Dos often especially to feel comfortable with a hooded sweatshirt in Scottsdale, its that kind of place.  The music is great is diverse from hip hop to rock and roll.    Drinks: Dos is known for Coronas, they promote awesome specials for Thursday, and when it rains Dos offers cheap drinks.   Food, I enjoy the prices of the late night menu, they cook until 2AM, nice. My favorite is the hard shell tacos, a former employee suggested them, I think their great for a small snack at the bar."}
{"text":"I am very surprised to see such high ratings for this place.  The ONLY thing going for Dos Gringos is the atmosphere.  It looks like it would be a fun place to hang out and have a cocktail with friends.  That is, if you can actually carry on a conversation without going hoarse because you have to yell to be heard over the blaring music.   This was our first visit to Dos Gringos.  My husband and I went out without the kids during this visit.  I saw that they had a kids menu but didn't look at prices or choices.  The food was extremely disappointing.  the chips were obviously dumped out of a bag somewhere in the back and the salsa was....bland.    I ordered a pick two combo which came with mini (very mini, three bite tacos - could have been one bite for my husband) , flautas and rice and beans.  I swear that there could not have been more than 1 Tbsp of meat in each taco and flauta.  I don't think that the flautas actually had meat in them.  I take that back, a disgusting charred bit of steak fell out of it on my last bite.  My husband ordered 2 street tacos with rice and beans.  He ended up with substantially more food at a cheaper price than mine.  His tacos looked decent, but the meat I tasted was unimpressive.   We don't plan on going back to Dos Gringos anytime in the near future.  Even the chain restaurants have them beat and that's not saying much!    My rating: Blech"}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars because it's where we go to get wasted. I've never eaten here but it's a nice place to hang out with your buddies at night.my only complaint is that they could have a better selection of \"girly\" drinks."}
{"text":"PaintNite.com event. Drink deals were good. Street taco was a lil disappointment.  Meat seasoned well. Everything else bland and pale."}
{"text":"A dive but great food!  Great service! And in an ok area.  I would go back if in the area.  Nice out door seating."}
{"text":"We come from Los Angeles to watch spring training and stay close by and always come here for the drink specials and the great atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and  accomidating with the customers. If you are in town for some baseball gamesand in the are a good stop to enjoy LA HORA  FELIZ  / HAPPY HOUR."}
{"text":"Fun place! Went to happy hour with my coworkers after work and our server Sarah was awesome! Attentive and never let our drinks go empty! Fair warning - it's an outdoor type bar which in 100 degree weather isn't the best idea but still fun! No little kids around so we were able to be loud and have fun! Would go back for drinks (limited selection) and the Mexi fries. Shrimp tacos were good too."}
{"text":"really good shrimp tacos, house margarita could use some work."}
{"text":"Man, if these guys were trying to replicate a gringo bar in Mexico down to every last detail, then they have it absolutely nailed. Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.  Rumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place. The biggest reason I go here is because I love the staff! Happy hour prices are very good and the food is good. It is just a fun place to hang and laugh and share a few drinks. Now to get you guys to let me produce a video for you!! LOL"}
{"text":"Great staff! Great drinks ask for Jacqueline she's amazing! Thanks for taking care of our staff we appreciate you!"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, casual atmosphere and decent Mexican food- that's how I'd describe Dos. It's pretty much always packed- any night of the week- so you really can't go wrong choosing a night to hang out there.  Most of the seating is outside, but they do have a small inside bar if you want to get out of the sun.  I haven't been back to Dos since the time the bouncer wouldn't let me in. I guess I had one too many egg nog's at a Christmas party beforehand, yet my friends and I still thought we'd check out Dos. Word to the wise: don't throw a poinsettia in the parking lot in front of Dos for no good reason and still think they're going to let you in.  I will probably wait awhile until I show my face there again, but I recommend you go!"}
{"text":"We pulled in after a doctor's appointment just because we needed food. After we sat down, I checked the yelp reviews and got really scared.  But overall, while service was slow, it was friendly and overall good. It was also 2 PM on Wednesday and there were about 5 other customers in the area.   The food was good and pretty cheap.   Overall I wouldn't be opposed to going back but I don't think I would go on my own.  There isn't much to say about this place, its decently price, its okay/good food"}
{"text":"How does this place stack up against other award winning tacos in AZ, Toca Madera, I'm hoping for authentic. I order up a street pork chile verde taco and a margarita from a kind chela.   The taco was good and the drink was strong so as they say 'Con amor y aguardiente, nada se siente.'With love and liquor, all else is forgotten.' ¡Órale, pues!"}
{"text":"satan himself could not have dreamed of a more dreadful dead end shit hole as this. Nor would satan have made a worse taco. how is it possible to screw up a taco? its a tortilla with meat, onions, cilantro, and sauce of some sort. however, dos gringos managed to screw up at its most basic level. i couldn't eat those poor excuses of tacos. anyone claiming that they're ok should be in an institution or better yet, fed to an animal.  as far as people that lurk around this place, those poor bastards look like rejects from the worst of the worst from the college gene pools. the most unattractive group i've seen in ages.  by all means, stay away from this place unless you love eating terrible food and like hanging out with less than stellar people."}
{"text":"I love this dos, at least every other week I have to come for happy hour out on the patio. Occasionally I've found myself here from happy hour to reverse happy hour. $2 pacificos and margaritas and $1 happy shots. The food is bar food nothing special but, I usually eat it anyway. I don't think I've ever gone here on a Friday or Saturday night but, I can say it's an awesome weekday spot."}
{"text":"These drinks are poored weak and the crowd has gotten run down. Their $1 shot is basically kool aid. They $3 margaritas is like drinking out of a margarita mix bottle. The only thing this place is good for is the beer"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. I ordered a cheese crisp and a light beer, when my meal came I asked for salsa ( I mean after all it's a Mexican food restaurant). When the bill came I found out they charged me 3$ for salsa and 1$ for ranch. When I asked about this. The waitress grabbed a menu and said \" Look it's right here at the bottom under extra. You have to pay for salsa\"  I said to her what kind of Mexican food restaurant changes for salsa ?? She quickly said Chipotle does !!!   WOW really !!!!!!!  I asked the waitress to adjust the bill and she just kept pointing at the menu. I am amazed at how rude this place was  Rude, unclean and BLAH ......."}
{"text":"The food here is gross... really nothing good on the menu... we got a variety of food and it really seemed subpar. The drinks weren't great either... only upside is that the alcohol in each drink seemed to be more than usual, so maybe the drunker you are, the better the food! The restaurant as a whole would be cool but it really seems like a rundown watering hole that people come to, to get drunk.. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"National Taco Day. Hmmmm...where should we go? Since we were guests, we relied on our (awesome) hosts to suggest a place. They picked Dos Gringos. We were in the late-lunch, old-folks-way-too-early-for-dinner crowd... Happy Hour margaritas were good and a great price. Chips and queso dip were yummy despite the vicious little pepper hiding in the cheese that bit me. My fat taco was very tasty. His taco salad was huge and looked amazing.  I'm not sure this would be a place I'd want to hang out when it gets going. It's clearly a party place for party people, but when I was younger...ooooh! The trouble I could have gotten in to here...  Great price, good food."}
{"text":"We came here after an Angels spring training game. The yellow banner hanging in right field at tempe stadium that read \"Dos gringos: A good place for day drinking\" was convincing enough. Good happy hour, good margarita, decent food, ok atmosphere, alright service.. Probably not a place I would visit again."}
{"text":"If its the end of your night and you have no idea what else yo do.. this place is awesome. Otherwise meehh...  It has a distinct smell of vomit. The mexican food is americanized mexican influenced stuff.. and the bar well I heard their margarita is cheap?  Not a huge fan. But I do come here on ocassion at the end of a night. In that case it never disappoints because it has that inviting chill atmosphere.  Super casual.. try it at least once."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is a rare find in Mesa!  I love coming here for happy hour!   What I get: 2 Tacos for $2 (tiny tacos) Street Taco $2 (medium size) Monster Taco for $3 (pretty huge) Corona with Lime Margaritas  The food here is so cheap and its great to come here when you're coming in a huge group. I also take visitors here. The other thing I really like is the fact that there are games: Jenga and Beer Pong, and other games just to name a few. At night they also have a DJ and I love that its a young crowd.   I know I will be hitting this place up as long as I'm living in Mesa!"}
{"text":"This bar definitely feels like it should be on the beach in Mexico, and if it was it would be awesome! I thought it was just okay, not the best crowd, and a little run down. Probably won't be going back because there are so many other good places in the area."}
{"text":"Bouncers beating the crap out of helpless drunks - check  Bouncers taking away my friends ID that was not fake - check  Overzealous, arrogant, and brutal. I got no problem with it. I'm a type A personality so I'm all for knocking someone down a peg if they step out of line. My ID is real, I control myself when I drink, and I'm not a hellraiser, so I've NEVER had a problem at Dos. The food is tasty and pretty cheap, they have every beer you'd ever want, and an awesome rooftop bar. One of my favorite bars in the area still, but I wish it were closer to the city. I hate not being able to let loose here on a count of drinking and driving."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for lunch.  Service was terrible.  No free chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant.  Good luck getting a refill. Unfortunately, it was at my suggestion that we came here."}
{"text":"Previously reviewed but removed for lack of content. I visited the restaurant with my son this past week during the afternoon. I felt that the establishment is more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. The tacos I had I felt were marginal at best. Arizona is full of mexican food restaurants and I certainly would not recommend this establishment for food, but perhaps late night the bar appears to be a place to meet."}
{"text":"Been here twice sat in the outside area for happy hour the street tacos are good nothing amazing but for the price definitely a good snack and not bad. margaritas are definitely to sweet for me but that's not my field I'm a beer guy and they only have one beer on tap blue moon which is a little disappointing but I don't mind it those are a good deal as well. both servers I've had there were very good and the food was quick as well. It was a little annoying that the bartender went around and changed every single tv to Monday night football (an hour before the game was starting) after my server was nice enough to put on the basketball game I wanted to watch and he came over and changed it to the Monday night football pregame (with no sound mind you and not many people in the outdoor dining area) and followed it up by saying \"you weren't watching that were you im putting on Monday night football\" well now I'm obviously not... Not a huge deal obviously but I didn't see the need for the Monday night football pregame on all 15 tvs especially since I was the only one in the vicinity of this one. Just a little tidbit there but in terms of service and food you can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for the culture and the food. Try the chimichangas! They are the best most disgusting things I have ever had. The street and gringo fish tacos are awesome too! And Sunday's make your own Bloody mary Bar! This place is always fun, the bartenders are always great. I could never complain or refuse a trip there!"}
{"text":"I was here to meet people briefly.  The service was great but my appetizer was just \"ok\".  I would not shy away from eating here to try since the service was good."}
{"text":"Dammit - I have been here a dozen times and it's been so \"mixed\"... The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is \"lively\".  So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!"}
{"text":"Having a great time at Dos Gringos. The party atmosphere is perfect after a baseball game. Killer music, Corona buckets, chips, salsa and bean bag toss."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service from the moment you walk in. Want a quick drink? Walk over to Circle K next door and get yourself a case and drink at home."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and decent food. They have large homemade Jenga blocks and horse shoes for patrons to play. The Mexi Fries and queso are great appetizers as they taste fresh and have just enough spice."}
{"text":"Great vibe, friendly service, and huge array of beverages. Bar is always busy, but the bartenders do a great job of getting all orders out in a timely manner to the correct person. Food is decent."}
{"text":"Another beautiful day in paradise . . . and so we decided to have an outdoor lunch today . . . and with that said, we thought we would try this place . . . we had a ball.  We were greeted promptly after we chose a table . . . and our menus and drinks followed shortly there after . . . I ordered Juan's Famous Tacos with Rice and Beans.  While the tacos were good . . . I really would have liked more chorizo in the taco, so they were a kind of bland for me.  There rice and beans were very good though.  My only problem was that the tables were tacky . . . not sure if it was from not wiping down the tables well . . . or the fact that tables we wiped down and the cleaning product just mad the table paint tacky.  I am hoping the latter.  I will be back . . . but next time . . . I will definitely try something other than the tacos . . ."}
{"text":"Awesome staff!! Great environment to go and relax and have a few drinks after work or on weekends!"}
{"text":"No beer on tap, or at least they weren't serving it! Feels like a college bar, which is good and bad. Watched the game on the HD TVs!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and very surprising for bar food. Drink are good they always have a decent amount of alcohol however no blender at the bar. This place would be a 5 star review if the employees were better at customer service and the restaurant was cleaner. Nothing is ever properly wiped down inside or out and bathrooms are constantly out of soap."}
{"text":"Dos Gringos is a great place to go day drinking with some really good Mexican food. It's a dive bar with plenty of outdoor seating and THREE bars. Two are full outdoor and one is in and out door serving/seating. TV's are aren't large in size or number but they're there if you want to watch the game or whatever. Good number of people there most of the time but plenty of space as well so it's not overly crowded. Also, there's a Jenga game (probably 10 times the tabletop version, played with 2x4s) as well as cornhole (bags, beanbags, etc) that's free to whoever wants to play it in the outdoor section.   Always a great time at Dos Gringos!!"}
{"text":"This place is always good. The food is fairly cheap and tasty, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is decent. This is a bar first and foremost so don't expect traditional \"sit down\" service, but this is what makes this place great if you ask me. Keep the drinks and food coming! Highly recommended for a quick flavorful lunch or dinner stop with friends or even alone!"}
{"text":"Really a bad location and the wait staff could care less if you get served or not. It reminds me of a place that was in such a hurry to open they forgot a few of the must haves. Avoid it like the plague. Also I know many who have had their vehicles towed from parking around Dos Gringos. There is no where to park unless you're one of the first 10 patrons. Food was forgettable and the margarita gets a 1 out of 10 limes from me. Blah!"}
{"text":"I love this place~!   Reasonably priced~!  .....And Kids Eat Free Everyday~!   Chuck & Nicole are THE BEST Bartenders Ever~!  DJ On Monday Nights~!   ;)"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of the hole in the wall Mexican beach bar. The food is always very hit or miss and never really good. HOWEVER, they have a kitchen that stays open until 2am closing... So there's that. Drink prices are average."}
{"text":"This is a review of the restaurant setting. I walked in after lunch, about 1:00 PM  on a Friday. Dirty tables everywhere, birds flying in and out, all around the place and some settling down on dirty tables inside the restaurant having a feast of their own. The staff didn't seem to be concerned, well it did me. I adios right out of there.  You gotta be KIDDIN!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  First time here and we will definitely be back for more.  Came on a Saturday afternoon with the kids.  Ate inside.  Kids each had great cheese crisps and wife and I had shredded chicken tacos and chorizo enchiladas.  Everything was great.  Stayed for some drinks-$3 make your own bloody mary's- and listened to radical 80s tunes!  Cheap cheap food and really great atmosphere.  We'll see this place again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We used to be here regularly before I moved. I miss it so much that I make a stop in every time I am in town! They have great specials and plenty of room for all! Try the queso once and you will come back for more! Everything I have had has been great! And they keep the drinks flowing!"}
{"text":"You can't beat chips and salsa and a cold beer. I'd recommend their nachos too! Fernanda is one of their sweetest servers and is always attentive!"}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to get an after hours burrito.  After seeing the video of the chest-pounding, knuckle dragging bouncer pummeling some patron, we've x-ed Dos off our list.  We'd rather eat at the crappy Philly cheesesteak place or even pay Mickey's ridiculous--\"wanna-be night club\"--cover for late night eats . . ."}
{"text":"Eh.   Came here for Taco Tuesday night. They have taco and drink deals on Tuesdays, and other deals almost every other day of the week too.   I ordered crunch tacos, carnitas tacos, and tostadas. Tacos were 2 for $3 and the totadas were $6 for 2? So each taco was about $1.50 which isn't too bad. I just hated that I couldn't order just one since I love taste testing everything. If I could have I would have ordered one of each. The tacos were small, not really full of meat. Crunchy tacos were eh - definitely needed more flavor. The carnitas were BOMB, but so small! After 4 tacos, I was STILL hungry. So I ordered the tostadas. Man, those were big. Beans, meat, cheese, veggies. I ate one and I was out. I probably should have just ordered the tostadas and be done.   It was seat yourself type seating. And even though we were seated by a server, our service was still SO SLOW. No drinks, no orders taken, took forever to flag someone down for the bill. I wasn't in a hurry or anything, but its just frustrating when there is NO ONE to be found and isn't not even busy in the restaurant.   Environment: 3/5 Food: 2.5/5 Price: 4/5 - only for taco tuesday deals Service: 1/5"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were good, but were a little pricey. Our server, Kaylee, was super nice and gave us some insight on entertainment around Tempe. Glad we went!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here and the drink specials are pretty good, but if you're hungry definitely go somewhere else.  I have never been impressed with the food.  It's very mediocre at best."}
{"text":"A good bar for friends to hang out but stay away on the weekend nights as its full of pathetic losers and college kids, way too many old men acting far too young for their age and old women (cougars) trying to seduce younger guys with their husbands/ex-husbands money."}
{"text":"Dos has become the regular spot for my friends and I. It's the perfect chill place to grab a drink after work during the week or go hard on the weekend when you're not feeling the stuffy Scottsdale clubs. Tony, Ty and Tyler always go out of their way to make sure our drinks are filled, bellies full and spread the laughter all around. If your looking for a place with great food, wonderful staff and plenty of room for activities, Dos is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Normally I would rate Dos a 3 or better but last night I had a really bad experience.  For starters as me and my friend walk in the door guy says \"Are you sure you both are 21?\"  UM yeah I am almost 30 and my buddy just turned 30.  So after showing our ID's we go in and grab some beers.  The selection is ok mostly mexican beers which are fine but you better be ready to go pee about 50 times while drinking them.  On one of my trips to the bathroom I get stopped by the same door guy who says \"I was told you need to be escorted out. \"  I am totally confused as I am not even buzzed and didn't do anything wrong.  So he says \"Someone says you were swerving as you were walking\".  WHAT??????  I am not driving for one and for two I am able to walk perfectly fine.  I walk a line for him and say see obviously not drunk.  He tells me \"Ya you seem ok so go ahead and stay\"  Like it's a privilege or something.  So I go and get my buddy and we headed next door to Whitehouse which was a great decision."}
{"text":"Hot bartender! Good food! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I luv celebrating taco tuesday at Dos. They have street tacos and gringo tacos for 2 bucks all day... so yum o! My fav are the steak tacos with cabbage, lime, cilantro, and some pico... goes well with corona or dos equis. Happy Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos in town. The service is great food comes out fast. Joey and Ty are really on point and always manage to take special care of me when they are busy. Monday nights after 7:00 pm 3$  beers, Wells, and wine. Great atmosphere, great people, and lots of TVs to watch your favorite sport games."}
{"text":"There isn't an option to put 0 stars but if there was, this location deserves that. I've been to this location four different times and each time, my service was exceptionally terrible. The only reason I returned was because it was so close to home and the tacos. One time visiting, it was happy hour and none of our drinks were discounted correctly and the server ordered the wrong food....instead of a manger apologizing, the server just said sorry and didnt do anything about it. Pretty professional. This very last time, I knew better, so I set a timer. It took 15 minutes until my friend got fed up and decided to ask a server if we could get some drinks. The drinks came instantly after that, meaning that they weren't busy. But after that, we were told our server would be by shortly for a food order. Another 22 minutes went by until we got another server's attention to get our food order. Some more time went by and our appetizer never arrived but the table in front of us that arrived AFTER us had already received their MAIN meal. We had to remind the server we even ordered an appetizer. She was too busy dancing and talking to the other server to realize we were there. Never offerred refills or asked how the food was, didnt even bring the check. We asked for the manger twice and no one stopped by, yet again. Never returning to this location. Worst service I have EVER experienced.  ***And I'm a server myself, so I can be empathic if it is busy but on all occasions, it was slow."}
{"text":"It sure isn't authentic Mexican food, but why fool ourselves.  That's not why we're here.  We're here for our nacho fix and some Mexican Moonshine at noon and it always fits the bill.  The food is as it says it is on the menu, the prices are fair and as a bonus to y'all, I went out on a limb and tried the ceviche.  I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"I've always liked Dos Gringos and it was on our \"pub crawl\" a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday I just returned.  Funny fact:  You can bring a baby into most any bar in Scottsdale, but Dos Gringos will put up a stink (it was 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon - not even a night-time-party-time - and they said the baby wasn't allowed.  One of the girls we were with hunted down the manager and told him this was America and it was the baby's god given right to be in a bar (yeah, it was hard to keep a straight face).  Long story short, the baby was allowed in.  Once we were in, other kids were already in there too.  If you're going to let any kids in, I would think babies would be your safest bet.  All they care about is breast milk and naps.  They're not going to be sneaking drinks.    Anyway, I love Dos Gringos' Mexican Moonshine, I love that you can sit outside and relax and I've never actually had anything bad here, so four stars it is."}
{"text":"This place rocks, been coming here for years and the staff is always smiling and attentive.  The menu has continually evolved for the better with innovations in flavor and the emergence of house made sauces and drink mixes.  They also have a brand new cocktail menu that is off the charts.  Do not be deceived by the dive patio look.  This place has it going on for your food and drinking needs.  Victoria rocks Saturdays!"}
{"text":"100% Dis Gringos waters down their drinks. I just ordered a Long Island Ice Tea and it is 100% Koolaid and water.... Not cool DG..... I'm sitting here in the booth right now and if my next drink is better I'll delete this, if not and you're reading this. It was water!!!"}
{"text":"Ok...so this is not a fancy mexican restaurant, but I love the atmosphere!  I always feel like I could be in mexico, and I mean on a vacation enjoying myself.   I love the outdoor seating .  I am vegetarian and the staff was great in helping me select a good item.   The happy hour price on rita's was fantastic.   Fun Times!  Will for sure come back"}
{"text":"This place could be so much better. Drinks are alright, depending on the bartender. No consistency. Really the only thing consistent has been the lukewarm beers. I have also gotten food from here several times with good and bad experiences. I understand it's az and its 115 all the time- but most other bars in the valley seem to have the cold beer part figured out. Get on board. Especially for having such a small selection for beer. I give it three stars because the servers are friendly, they do allow dogs, and they have a really cool atmosphere (which could use some overdue easy TLC)."}
{"text":"Lousy service. Could not get a water refill or chips or any attention. The bottom line is we had to get up and chase down our own drinks, water, chips salsa and when food came after almost 45 minutes it was warm at best and the excuse was were training a new person in the kitchen. No one that evening appeared to care about service and this place was not at all busy. We had to go for some volunteer work across the street and I tried to speak to someone but they did not stop by before we had to leave so we were not late. Most of us had maybe 15 minutes to scarf down our food as it was."}
{"text":"The bathroom was funny. The urinals were labeled with beer names. The wall said something about beer recycling. So I was under the impression that when you use the urinal, that is what you are allegedly drinking if you order draft beer. I think that is what was meant by the signs. One urinal said \"Heineken\" and one said \"Corona\". I thought that was an alright joke. So I guess don't buy drafts there. Because it is urine. There were three urinals lined up with no partition, one urinal was off to the side with a wooden wall. It had a sign that said \"Shy Guy\". That cracked me up. There was 25 cent beers of schwag Miller High Life, well worth it. Good time because of the dude I was with, otherwise, this place is lame as all hell."}
{"text":"Lazy, ignorant staff. Tried paying with Visa gift card and was told we couldn't because the owner & corp won't let them take it.  NO WHERE is it noted they don't take valid forms of payment. Now the girls can get their tip from their idiot boss or from the corporate office they work for. Ignorance breeds ignorance. At least get a decent 'talk off' if this \"happens all the time\"."}
{"text":"I typically love Dos Gringos and believed they had the best chimichanga in the Valley.  I ordered the SuperGooeyCheesyChimichanga as I always do when we make the annual trip but the meat just tasted dried out and was probably a little overcooked.  Was also upset to hear they closed the Scottsdale location.  I'll be back again but hope the meat is more edible next time."}
{"text":"In terms of Mexican joints this place is the best.  With the outdoor atmosphere, tacky decor and authentic food, it just doesn't get any better.  The other locations are just as good.  The staff is usually pretty cool too, although one time we waited a VERY long time to get served at the Scottsdale location."}

{"text":"This must be a 3-star day for me, thank goodness I had good company.  I don't know, after my second visit today, I'm just meh on Dos Gringos. I mean, its a great looking place. I love the outdoor idea and having the option to be indoors if you really want to be, lots of vibrant colors and different types of seating all around. The people that go here are pretty chill and the service is great. But other than that, I can't think of any reason to give this place a higher rating. I can't say much about the food, the most I've had is chips and salsa here. The drinks are stiff and the water is tasty?"}
{"text":"Um, can I say that they have one of the worst bartenders ever at this joint. I can't even remember this idiot's name but he charged me for drinks that I didn't even order. When a guy goes, \"I'm buying these two ladies shots.\" it does not mean charge one of the ladies on her card that she opened a tab on 30 minutes afterward...Seriously?! And he had horrible customer service, there was barely anyone at the bar and the man acted like he was overwhelmed. There's a $5 authorization fee, why isn't this written or mentioned someplace a bit more visible, this would have totally discouraged me from opening a tab if I had seen it, yea it only sits in your account as pending, but if you're tight about your money like me, that is not cool! Hidden fees are expected from a mobile phone company, not a bar. Automatic 2 star deduction Dos Gringos, sorry!  Lesson learned, any bar night from now on at any establishment, no tabs, cash only. The upside, there was one very awesome bartender, Troy, that just about made me forget about the horrible one mentioned above. He was very nice because he turned off a fan that was freezing myself and a friend to death. And he took care of getting the drinks I didn't even order to be reversed. Thanks mang, good looking out! Great crowd otherwise and the food and drinks not too shabby. If I ever return, it will be based on some madness that I have no control over, aka my friend(s)."}
{"text":"I went here for Thanksgiving eve and wow, what a mess it was. If you're a guy, don't even bother looking for women because the girl to guy ratio is 1:3. And a lot of those women were neither on the attractive or underweight side. The clientele ranged from 20-something white trash, aspiring tattoo artists to Latino gangbanger types. Yeah, it gets worse.  The house DJ they had in sucked big time. I walk in and right on cue, he played Cupid Shuffle - the worst thing to hit the music scene since Yin Yang Twins. Then he played \"Teach Me How To Dougie\" (arrggh) and followed it by the worst Oasis - Wonderwall meets hip hop mashup I've ever heard. Where the hell did they find this no-talent hack, Hurricane Bay?  This place might be alright on a weeknight or less-busy weekend. But as a club, it fails considerably. The bouncers were doing nothing all night, and I saw too many people making drunk fools out of themselves as they continued to drop glass containers on the floor or lose balance and fall over. Hopefully, they'll be a big lawsuit and spare everyone the trashy disaster known as Dos Gringos."}
{"text":"Go, go, go!!!  Great food, fantastic atmosphere, cold beer,friendly crowd and staff.  If you are looking for a fun time in Scottsdale, you have to go here."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food- but the people that work here are so friendly so if you're visiting the area, this is a great spot to stop by at! We brought in our Spring Training ticket after the game and received an offer for 1 dollar Old Style beer- a great deal. The security guard inside was working as like a host, asking if we wanted anything, and giving us huge smiles. A lot of people were walking in and getting tables immediately."}
{"text":"We decided to give Dos Gringos a whirl and have happy hour outside. As we walked up to the caged-in patio area, we had the option to either enter left or to enter right to the smoking section. Gross. Standing there in the middle at the entrance, all we could smell was smoke. It was all around the bar area, which made me begin to lose my appetite. This place is completely divey, and that wasn't what I was feeling that evening.  I liked their reasonable happy hour specials. The tostadas were good, not super flavorful. Two came together at the happy hour price. I also liked their chips and salsa - both had pleasing consistencies. Ordering extra salsa was $1...I understand, I guess, but still a bummer. It wasn't like we didn't order other items. The queso was decent. Of course, it was a sodium festival in my mouth. The happy hour margarita was gross. A margarita lover, I was disinterested after two sips. However, Chelsea (I'm guessing on the spelling) was a sweet and attentive server.  Two stars for the friendly service and the chips and salsa. The disgusting smoking, filthy dive bar feel, overall mediocre food, and yucky margarita have made me not want to return to Dos Gringos."}
{"text":"Fun place for the family during the day  I wouldn't recommend kids after dark. This place can get pretty rowdy but also fun. We enjoyed the corn holing game and there's pool tables inside if that's money our thing. Great patio seating but can get very warm during the summers down here. The mini chimi's are very good."}
{"text":"Came in early around 11 on a weekday. Was treated by Sam who was very nice, and helpful. Especially when my 9 yr old almost ordered very hot tacos. His advice was VERY much appreciated there! He was kind enough to put the spicy sauce on the side so my son could actually have fun trying it. His thoughtfulness made my son's experience here. The food was very enjoyable the location was dead though.  It could also use a cleaning. Yes, this is an indoor-outdoor location but there was truly an excess amount of dirt and grime."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this particular location before, so I wasn't sure if it would be like the old Dos that used to be on Uni by ASU.  But the NYF tournament party was there, so I had to go.  And I was a little hesitant because honestly...the party usually sucks.  However, I was totally wrong about this place!  The (free) margaritas were potent, beer was cold, chips were addictive, and the waitresses were very accommodating (and hot...that too).  They made sure we were constantly filled up, even if some people weren't tipping (bad juju!).  I didn't try the food, and I probably won't be back here unless I'm in this part of AZ again (which would be...same time next year), but if I could, I'd go back for sure.  Wish I had ordered food though, just to see how they were...  I never ordered their fish tacos, because when I was a student, i was more concerned with drinking as much as I could before getting booted as opposed to eating."}
{"text":"I invited about 25 people here on Saturday and had a blast! Good atmosphere, good drinks and everyone had a great time! I have friends who live within walking distance and it makes for a great safe night out. There aren't too many bars in Mesa so this is definitely a good find!"}
{"text":"This place is very comfy, laid back vibe, serving only bottled beer and a full bar. The food is not bad. It's not very authentic, but your typical Mexican food. This place is really busy at night and it's a big hang out spot. I don't go here much, but never remember ever being disappointed in service or food."}
{"text":"ok, on those nights that you really don't feel like going downtown, but still wanna go somewhere to chill with friends, this place is PERFECT!  whats not to love about the sweet margs, cheap beer, and awesome happy hour specials!   the chicken dip is absolutely amazing!   We used to come here for dinner once a week also, but since they took the stuffed poblano off them menu, we really only come for drinks and apps.  the employees are so much fun and the whole atmosphere just makes you forget your stress.. or was it all those delicious strawberry margs?...   hmm :)"}
{"text":"Oh Dos Gringos in Tempe (Priest),   i miss you like crazy!! you were always my go to spot!!   Chuck (bestest bartender ever) is soo much fun and keeps you smiling.   uhh i digress..   Now that im in Mesa, This place is close,... and is still alot of fun..  The same kind of atmosphere, and happy hour specials, and the employees are super sweet, and became fast friends.  That being said,  the crowd just doesn't seem as fun and outgoing here.  I love meeting new people, and at this Dos,  the peeps just don't seem as friendly. hmm, maybe living soo far out makes everyone put their crabby pants on??  I've only had the Apps at this location, but so far, everything is equally as delish here as the other locations. Maybe i just need to give the atmosphere more of a chance now that the weather is warming up,...   I'll  keep ya posted !"}
{"text":"Having been to all of the Dos Gringos in the valley, I'm tied for my favorite between here, and the south Tempe location(priest) I love the outdoor 'tiki bar' vibe they have going, and the bartenders/ servers are usually fun and engaging. Not at all a typical 'Scottsdale' bar, in fact, the very opposite. Usually very friendly crowd.:) I love margaritas and if you get here during happy hour, they have awesome deals! Regular, flavored, frozen, on the rocks, you pick, there all delish(even though from a mix, not overly sweet). The food is actually really good, I love the burros, tacos, nachos, gringo rolls, etc.never a bad choice for a fun night out, or drinks with friends:)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals.  The atmosphere is nice.  The music is amazing.  My only complaint focuses in on the Mahi Mahi tacos.  I understand it's Arizona and all, but please don't be stingy with your fish and expect us to pan out $4 per tiny taco.  What a ripoff!  I explained the situation and how ripped-off I felt, and they were understanding...but I'll know better next time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, my bf loves their Street Tacos, personally I wasn't a fan of the tacos but Wow I was impressed with my Super Cheesey Gooey Chimichanga.  I was skeptical at first but it really isn't overloaded with cheese like I was worried it would be, like too much cheese and not enough meet.  It was SO good, loaded with shredded pork, and the green sauce gave it good flavor. I wasnt too sure what \"jalepeno cream cheese\" meant, but it turned out to be this really delicious cheese sauce with a nice jalepeno flavor and kick to it.   The fresh pico de gallo along with the shredded pork and creamy sauce just came together so nicely. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just an AZ classic. Great tacos, lots of drinks, and a remarkably tacky atmosphere. Gets fratty Thurs-Sat but hey, what can you expect in PHX?"}
{"text":"Oh, good old Dos Gringos.  I make it a point to hit up this place whenever I'm in Tempe.  The food is cheap, delicious, and there's an excellent patio that is awesome to sit on year-round.  The service can slack a bit when they're busy, but the wait staff seem to always make up for it.  The salsa is delicious, not too spicy, and extremely flavorful.  I've never had a complaint about their food and the drinks are on-point.  The outdoor patio is also dog friendly, which is really awesome.  And there are huge Jenga pieces and a bag toss game which is popular with the kids I've seen there.  I honestly don't know why this place only has three stars...give them a try."}
{"text":"Maybe I haven't been to Dos Gringos in a while, or maybe this location is just grosser than the Tempe location, but this place is dirty!  The bathroom has a bad smell coming from it and everything just seems kinda filthy.  I would never ever order food from here, if their bar area is this dirty I can only imagine how gross the kitchen is... I'm not really sure why people would hang out here when there are plenty of nicer and more fun spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I went to Dos Gringos after work to relax , only to have been met with TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! waitress notified our group that she had to leave, she offered to transfer our tab to another waitress only to return twenty minutes later to inform us that all other waitresses refused to service us , because our group was sitting outside. ( which was under shade and with misters on I might add). I will never recommend Dos Gringos to anyone!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for a drink.  Nice open layout.  The bar has upstairs and downstairs levels - the lower level has games like cornhole and a giant Connect 4 set.  The house frozen margarita is deliciously limey with a nice layer of salt around the rim.  The food is on the pricey side.  The buffalo wings claim to be a \"full pound\", but at six pieces I'd be surprised if the dish weighed a half pound.  They are deliciously spicy, though - if you don't like too much fire, let the server know and they will tone it down for you.  The seafood street tacos were so small that we laughed when they were brought out.Good flavor, though.  The other street tacos are also small but tasty.  The best value is to order the 6 pack.  You can mix and match on the fillings."}
{"text":"They call this a bar? I think these reviewers are paid off. Nobody has mentioned that they don't have kegs or beer on tap. That's right, a bar that serves bottles only.  Once I heard that, I should of just left, but I stuck in there. I ordered a bucket of coronas, which you get 5 of. Happy hour it's 2.50 a piece, now I went on a Saturday night around 8pm. $20 bucks for 5 12 oz bottles. Now my mistake for not asking the price, but in my bar experiences, I never paid 20 bucks for 5 bottles. I also ordered 2 starry night shots, they cost me $6 bucks a piece. $6 bucks for a shot are you freaking kidding me!  It was my brothers birthday, that's why I didn't ask about prices, I thought it would be reasonable based on the reviews here. They even charged me for the $1 bday shot the bartender gave my brother. We didn't even ask for it. So as you can see I am pretty pissed about the whole experience. Also it was quite dead for it being a saturday night, but I don't blame people not coming there. Next time I'll stick to my regular spots.  $36 bucks got me: 5 coronas, 2 shots of starry night and a birthday shot out of a plunger (that's right, a toilet plunger)"}
{"text":"I'm not a bar person, and I'm not a Scottsdale person - but I freaking love this place.    This has been a designated hang out spot many times.  Many times.  And it always hits the spot.  Just enough Cool, a heaping helping of laid back, a splash of irony and garnished with some decent tasting and decently priced Mexican food.  Yea, the food is garnish.  I mean really, would you come here to eat?  That said, I can speak highly for the tacos and the nachos because those are often our things to get.    I love the Mexican beach theme because since becoming a designated adult I get down there much less that I'd like to go - so I have to take what I can get.    Folks are normally pretty cool there too.  Every once in awhile you get some folks who walked in a bit too sauced already or feel like they should be a higher level of customer or something - but it doesn't happen too often.  That and the fact that it still gets pretty freaking hot there during the summer - even with misters - keeps it from 5 star glory.  But on a great weather kind of day - there's nothing better."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you want drinks and drinks only. The food is just that food with extra sauce to give it a little flavor. The service is bad, almost like they are under staffed. Maybe its just me because I work in customer service but it seems like every Dos Gringos is like this. I may be back but unfortunately for them its only gonna be for the beer from the tap forget about anything that has to be made. Fail!"}
{"text":"I visited Dos Gringos with my wife for the 1st time.  We have friends that go to a different location and rave about it.  We went in around 6pm Sunday night and it was a little slow.  The waitress we had was fantastic.  We ordered the Nachos as an appetizer, it was awesome!  My wife ordered the Mini Chimi combo and she was quite pleased with it.  I ordered the SuperCheeseyGooeyChimichanga, I asked for it to be brought out as a burrito because I didn't want it Fried.  The waitress said it was fantastic that way.  She wasn't lying, my only complaint about it was that it was huge!  This is not a bad thing, I took over half of it home.    This place was a little hipper than I am, which again isn't a bad thing.  I enjoyed the music and our dinner there, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went here to get some tacos for lunch because everyone at work were raving about them.   I ordered 2 shredded beef and 2 shrimp tocos on flour tortilla to go. when I got back to my work which was 500yards away I was excited to eat. When I opened the boxes I could not believe what I saw. My food did not even look like tacos. I got corn tortillas which were so soggy that I couldn't even eat with fingers. The shrimp was WAY overcooked and hard, and also some pieces still had shells on them. The shredded beef tacos looked horrible. I had a nice amount of meat which was good but it wasn't even inside the tortilla, also I got a total of about 5 pieces of onion between the two of the tacos and a tiny splash of \"salsa\".   I am sure this place is way better than this but I am not a happy customer."}
{"text":"they lied.  the tacos were not half price, even though that is what it said on the wall AND on the menu. nope. we were charged full price and 6 little tacos, although tasty, are not worth $15.   when i asked the bartender what the deal was, he said they got rid of that deal. i pointed to the wall, and he says, \"yeah, i know.\" and that was it.   plus, a fight broke out behind us and it wasn't even 8pm (we were there for happy hour). entertaining if they would have let it go on, but the guys were so drunk they could barely swing. (heavy on the sarcasm).  we used to go here a bunch a few years ago, but now it's just bad cougars and people that like to fight. awesome for some, but not for me."}
{"text":"This is our favorite happy hour spot! It's got a great outdoor patio. Order the Mexican iceberg for your drink. It's a margarita with an upside down bottle of beer inside. Even though it's on the menu, sometimes the waitresses don't know what it is, so I have had to explain it to them. I always order an appetizer for my meal, and that's the pulled pork mini chimis. They are so damn good... They recently updated the outdoor tv's, and the place needs some new paint, but we will keep coming back either way."}
{"text":"Lunch tacos. Easily the best in the valley. Simple but different and very, very tasty."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour on a Monday. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very rude. Multiple bartenders were forceful in trying to make us order food even though we were clear that we just wanted drinks. The gringorita was not drinkable and a disgrace to all margaritas. This place has a lot of potential, but the service won't allow it to reach it."}
{"text":"Fun place to come drink and socialize in the evening. I am from out of town and had a blast here. Cheap aclohol and a lot of people. Another positive: they serve late night mexican food munchies."}
{"text":"If sitting in the sun enjoying a couple of beers and good relaxing fun with your friends is your thing, then look no further.  Maybe it's me getting older, but I enjoy this place much better during the day than at night.  The daytime crowd is my kind of people:  drinking, talking, and enjoying the day.  Plus if you've got a dog, feel free to bring them in.  They allow them out on the patio.  Beer is beer, and they've got plenty of it.  My friend swears by the margaritas here, saying they are cheaper than other places but stronger than most.  The food here is quite good.  You'd think for how cheap the tacos are you'd get nothing, but they are very tasty and come with a good amount of meat on them.  I get them gringo style and they can't be beat.  Other food favorites:  rocky point nachos, the baja shrimp sandwich, and for those hangover days, the aptly named hangover breakfast burrito.  Service is hit and miss here.  Weekend nights it's full of the college kids and those that think they are still in college, hence why I stay away once the sun goes down.  Although seeing all the bras lining the ceiling inside, the mind wanders as to how they all might have gotten there..."}
{"text":"I love the food here! And the patio is amazing they have good service too. Haven't played any of the bar games, but they have plenty of them to keep ya entertained. The food alone is worth a stop, especially for taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Wow, this place isn't what I remember.. Either I've gotten older and look great for my age or everyone else has aged horribly. I think im the youngest chick her, or maybe the chick with the baby is, either way.. Unless the drinks flow faster it may be a short visit."}
{"text":"Came here one late evening with my girlfriend, who knows everybody here. :-)  The tacos were delicious, and the drinks were well made.  I tried the signature margarita here, and it was solid goodness.    There is a sign above the bar that says something like I Y C R T B M A D, and you will have to ask the bartender what that means - and be prepared to buy a drink once you find out.    Part of the restaurant is an outdoor patio, which is great when it's nice out.  It was rainy and super windy the day I visited."}
{"text":"I popped in here for a drink with co-workers after a work function recently. The outdoor seating and ambience were nice, which is the only reason I'm giving them  three stars and not two. The service and the alcohol selection were lacking, in my opinion. If friends were coming into town and wanted to go out, this isn't someplace that would immediately spring to mind to take them."}
{"text":"We always have fun here. There's giant Jenga and Connect 4 and seriously, try the nachos with a margarita. My only complaint is that they don't have pina coladas, but' a minor gripe. Great place."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Local organizations (Apollo Group, US Airways, Intel) converge on this location making it a difficult experience. If you do go on a weekend night, be ready to navigate that small parking lot."}
{"text":"Love Kristine, Megan, and Nick! They know our \"usual\" and always make time to come by and say hi. Not just say hi, though. They ask how our week was, what's new...they take a general interest in us which is refreshing to experience from the normal bar atmosphere. It's dog friendly so be sure to bring your four-legged friend!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Dos Gringos?  Okay, maybe me.  But you have to love that it can smell like diarrhea in one corner of the place and still be packed.  No, I am not exaggerating.  Just ask Eric R!  Still, I have never had a bad time at Dos.  A bad margarita?  Yes.  It was quite sweet... both times Saturday... but my over served self didn't mind too terribly.  I'm still not 100% positive where we picked up the golf cart back to the hotel, but even in 6\" heels I kept my balance and I didn't trip and fall on my face.  Score!  PSA: Never drink and drive.  It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, and the kitchen is open late. Drinks can be cheap if you're ordering the right thing. The past couple of times I've been there the service has been slow, unless you sit up at the bar. Employees are pretty nice though!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this bar!  This is a wonderful place to go with a mixed group of people that want to have fun and meet lots of crazy people.  I've met some crazy people here and I always have fun!  Drinks are well priced and never weak.  I've taken lots of out of town friends here and everyone has loved it!  This is a must stop in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but I've definitely had better. Services, sucks. Waitresses are only there to look pretty and hope to get picked up by a cute guy. (NOT JUST 1 WAITRESS, ALL OF THEM)"}
