{"text":"I wanted to try something new and decided to give this place a go. The pizza was delicious, I had a deep dish meat combo. The dining area was a good size and the staff was really nice. This is a great neighborhood pizza spot. I will be going here in the future!"}
{"text":"Don't understand all the positive reviews on this place. Pizza was average at best. Salad was bad, iceberg lettuce with a couple olives. Service was below average and it wasn't cheap like it should be. A lot better pizza places out there."}
{"text":"It's OK. For what it is, it's a little pricey. Pizza is decent but nothing spectacular. The salad I got was pretty uninspiring- hardly any veggies aside from iceberg lettuce and bottle dressing. Best thing I had was pasta dishes- those are quite good."}
{"text":"Had the sausage sandwich with cheese, hot peppers and marinara on Friday. Very filling and delicious. Came back for the Pizza on Sunday. Tried both thin crust and deep dish.  Both excellent. Full House is our new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Decent, but I'm a pizza snob.  If I'm going to have pizza I'll go to a little more effort and drive up to Elliott and get Oregano's.  Thin pan are both excellent and their pan is as good as you'll get even if you were in Chicago.  Not as good as Lou Malnati's, but you definitely wont be disappointged"}
{"text":"The service was nice and the delivery was fast.  Overall the pizza was good and I'd say worth the price.  My only issue was that I typically associate Chicago deep dish with a corn flour crust which this was not. Also, they made it a bit too salty for my taste. Otherwise pretty good."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza for a good price.  The people there are really nice and you get a ton of pizza!  Really yummy!  Found my new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Place is banging! Not sure if the guy working was the owner or just an employee but he WAS AWESOME, respectful and made some great pizza and wings! FOOD WAS GREAT customer service was great and we will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"First time visit...and It was just before closing. Owner was very friendly and the pizza was excellent!! I will be visiting again on my next trip to Chandler."}
{"text":"I'm definitely surprised by the positive reviews, I found this pizza terribly disappointing. The thin crust was chewy not crunchy, also partially burnt around the edges but mushy and undercooked in the middle. Unless you consider canned mushrooms tasty the ingredients were poor quality and very bland.  $16 for a medium pizza with veggies out of a can is ridiculous but I'm giving it 2 stars because the person behind the counter was polite."}
{"text":"Preface: I grew up eating authentic Chicago deep dish pizza)  I would rate this pizza as a 4...the toppings were fresh and delicious but when you get down to the thick crust it had little flavor. Usually a really good deep dish pizza has a buttery almost flaky crust. It was a little pricey but that is understandable since it's not a corporate dime a dozen. I love to support a local small business and we will be back."}
{"text":"Service: fast and friendly Food: absolutely fabulous Seating and decor: not so much.  If you're going for takeout or delivery, there isnt a better place, this pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. The service was good. I got the thin crust pizza. It was cracker thin. The ingredients were good. I cant give it five stars though. It was just good."}
{"text":"Pizza is absolutely delicious. I can't wait to come to try the deep dish. We got carry out, service was quick and gentleman was very informative. Now I'm hungry just writing this review."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Ate here for the first time. Pizza was ready for pick up when expected. Guy at counter was very nice. Interior was small with a few tables if u wanted to grab lunch. Theres also a tv.  We wanted to try this as we recently had deep dish from Buddyz in queen creek. While neither pizzas were amazing, they were both good with the edge going to Buddyz. The crust did not have much flavor at all. I'm still trying to find a place that has an amazing buttery crispy crust on a deep dish pie.   I would go back if I lived near by, but I would not drive the 15-20 mins again to get a pizza."}
{"text":"Got the lunch special small pepperoni pizza. Service was quick for lunch time. Price is good for amount of food. Tastes good but not the best I have had."}
{"text":"Very good pizza here. The restaurant  is very small and is best for takeout. the deep dish we had was very good. the edge crust was thick but tender and the bottom crust was thin like a cracker crust."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Full House Pizza several times and it is always great. I love that I can get any type of pizza here. I like thin crust, and my wife likes the Pan style. You can tell that they know what they are doing. They have a great selection from ribs to salad and sandwiches. I really like the Italian beef. It has great flavor and very lean.  I love to support local businesses that have a quality product, give this place a try, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and pasta. My new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Just tried the deep dish with pepperoni.  Wow. It was so good!  The sauce had great flavor.  Now it's going to be tough deciding between thin and deep dish."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. We ordered their daily special Large Cheese and 12 baked wings for $19.95. I also tried out their Italian Beef sandwich.   Since I only live 1/2 mile from this place the pizza was still way to hot to eat, so I started with a couple of wings. The wings were large sized, and meaty. I ordered the hot sauce which was not even warm to my taste buds, but I'm a chilihead. I gave them a few drops of good hot sauce and they were decent then, or at least as good as you can get baking them in the oven. They are a little healthier, but they don't have that good crispy skin.    Next up was the pizza. I only had a half a slice, and as cheese pizza goes it was decent. The hand tossed crust was good, but a little soft. The sauce was decent with a little bit of tang, and there was a good amount. There was plenty of cheese, and not to much grease.   Ok now my hopes are up for the Italian beef, which came with peppers included a nice touch. The sandwich was loaded with meat and hot peppers, and it came with a cup of beef juice. The bread was good, but the meat had very little flavor.  The meat was very thinly sliced, which is the Chicago way, but when it is sliced that thin it does not hold well.  There was a different taste in the dipping juice. I think it was red wine vinegar, but I'm not certain. It was not overly salty, but it seemed to be missing the beef flavor.  Lobby's still has the best Italian Beef in the east valley.  My wife only had the pizza. She's the one who like cheese pizza, I like them loaded. Her comment was that she still likes the costco deli pizza better. I think the costco stuff is just average at best.   I may go back and try a loaded deep dish from this place. The pictures look good."}
{"text":"We had the chance to enjoy this pizza on 3/20/16 and it did not disappoint! We ordered our pizza deep dish and it was amazing! Great staff nice and friendly. Everything about our pizza was fantastic. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really excellent pizza.  Have had all the crusts and enjoyed them all.  Hand tossed still my favorite.  Excellent sauce and toppings.  High quality.  Being a small business owner myself I think we should support this small local business for being better than all the chains!!"}
{"text":"I got the deep dish pepperoni and a veggie combo regular crust. Both were delicious....but I liked the veggie one a little better. Delivery was faster than the estimated time and the guy who delivered the pizza was very nice. I am very happy to have this pizza place in the area...always nice to have options besides the major pizza chains."}
{"text":"Thank You Full House Pizza!  After an excruciating 1 mile drive home (the amazing smell of the pizza was killing me), I got to dig into my first Full House Pizza.  This is the BEST pizza around and it is run by really cool people.  We ordered the deep dish and it was cooked to perfection (see photos).  Let's keep these guys in business, order from them tonight!!!  If you are in the area, and you like Rosati's, you will love Full House, trust me!  On a side note, don't pay any attention to Nate A.'s review.  It is his only review and who gets sick from pizza anyway, especially for 3 days!?!  I don't think so Nate A.!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the lunch slices are different from the normal fare but this place just doesn't do it for me when it comes to pizza.  The crust was the biggest let down, grade-school cafeteria-esque."}
{"text":"If you like garlic you will like Full House. Their Chicago style pizza is a little thin on materials, but thick on flavor."}
{"text":"First time here at full house pizza.  The deep dish special combo is a must!  It takes about 35 minutes to cook but well worth the wait.  The sauce is fantastic.  It has great flavor, so make sure to get a side of it to dip your crust in.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza from here 5-6 times now and are very pleased! This pizza is VERY similar to Rosati's. The prices are good and the location is awesome since we live right by here. We will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I have tried both the deep dish and hand-tossed. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Called to see if they deliver to our address and was told to go online and check. Sorry but that is not the response that should have been given. Don't answer the phone if you're not going to help the person calling. You will not get our business."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from here for the first time tonight.  We will definitely be back.  The sauce on the deep dish was fantastic.  It even got the kids approval, which is hard to do.  The crust was slightly over done, but I'd rather have it over done than under done like you get with a lot of other pizza places.  Soggy crust is the worst!  We also ordered wings which were fantastic.  I felt like the pricing was right for everything that we got.  Much better tasting food than a lot of gross chain pizza places out there.  Small business with big flavor.  See you next time!"}
{"text":"Insanely good pizza place. No preservatives, not greasy, definitely delicious.   Go. Now."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza lover. Having eaten it in Chicago and all over the country.  With that said this place serves a very good pie and I highly recommend them. By the way in Chicago you'll get a buttery thick cornmeal crust, lots of garlic, chunky tomatoes. Just like at this place. Good stuff..."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I've only had the deep dish but I'm sure everything else is great too. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered their pizza and it was baked to perfection, with my favorite spice GARLIC! I have been here a couple time so the delivery was fast one time and the service was excellent. I need to try their subs."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise live Chicago deep dish and this place serves it up the right way."}
{"text":"Great pizza by the slice with Wisconsin mozzarella for $3.00... nearly ate the whole huge slice.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is the bomb!  Order it all the time, pizza is always amazing, always hot, delivered within an hour. Bonus its sooooo big I have leftovers for days ;)"}
{"text":"Well I went in because of the big sign on the street that says \"Pizza by the Slide\" Walked in to see another big sign \"Pizza by the slice\" Went to order \"sorry no pizza by the slice that's only at lunch\" But but the signs.  I just wanted a bite to eat and then get back on the road. Bbq beef sandwich was good. Would visit again when I'm in the area to see if I can get a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"This place does not have good deep dish. The crust is funky tasting/smelling. I read other reviews that people got sick from it, and my girlfriend today woke up sick. I would definitely not eat this again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Great pizza, fresh ingredients, and friendly service. My wife loves the thin crust and it is the only place where my 8 year old, not only eats his veggies, but requests mushrooms, onions and green peppers on his pizza! A win for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Now 5 stars!  Best deep dish ive ever had.  Slice didn't fall apart when I tried to take it from the box ( hear that, Rosatis?) the crust was cooked golden brown, and wasn't soggy ( hear that Rosatis?)  Gonna try the sandwiches next!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Good variety in menu choices, good prices, and delicious pizzas. I would recommend to others for take out pizza."}
{"text":"Wow I must say I'm very excited about this place.   Today was the first time trying the deep dish pizza and it was excellent.   Loaded with cheese pepperoni and extra sauce.  Yum!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Q: Who makes a really good Chicago style deep dish pizza here in the Valley besides (some) Rosati's?  A: This place does!  I ordered a deep dish to go - it smelled and looked so good, I ate a slice right there and took the rest home. It was absolutely delicious. He uses quality ingredients. It's not dissimilar to my good experiences with Rosati's, but it does have a fairly unique flavor profile. It somehow tastes a little more Chicago.   I can't eat deep dish pizzas all the time without becoming a giant ball of lard, so this will have to be the occasional treat for me. I'm definitely coming here again though. I'll probably have to try their thin crust as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a pizza for pick-up.  I noticed online it said they deliver.  However, I called and they said they don't deliver.  So, I'm hoping they fix this issues fixed.  I did enjoy the pizza and the customer service was good besides the delivery issue."}
{"text":"Full House pizza is as authentic as Chicago pizza gets! I have ordered here several times and never been disappointed with the quality of ingredients, the excellent crunchy crust, and the friendly service. You can tell love and artistry go into making these pizza pies. The stuffed and deep dish are the best."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident but so happy that we did. If you are Midwestern and love thin and crispy square cut pizza this is the one and only place that you can get it. We've searched high in low since we moved here to find this type of pizza, we were so excited we tried a piece before we left the building. The crust is thin and airy and done just right. The sauce has just the right flavor. The owner is very pleasant and friendly. This place is worth the drive!!!"}
