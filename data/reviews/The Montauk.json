{"text":"Tuna tartar and burrata was good. TERRIBLE service!!! And it wasn't even busy for hh on a Monday yet nobody wanted to help. The girls next to us were complaining too that they weren't getting service. Tried to charge me $16 for a kettle dirty martini.... Um excuse me??? It's a wanna be Yacht club with terrible club music. The owner did take off the up charge for the martini which was nice. Won't be returning though! Better places to visit"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Service sucks.  Try getting a drink at the bar... it's a joke.   No one seems to care either.  So many other options in this town, and I've given this place way too many chances.  Peace out"}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch today, first and last visit. The food was memorable, it was awful. One member of our party had the wrong burrito delivered 3 times. a simple request, no cheese, really three times! Even the food served correctly was marginal at best. 
Then we ordered two crepes. They were basically dough that had not been grilled, baked, or whatever you do to a crepe to make it edible. How this was served is beyond me. The waitress, as she looked and saw we had not eaten them ,made no attempt to find out what the problem was. Of course just looking at them it was clear they were not made correctly.
Never again. I am amazed anyone liked this restaurant. Our server had a bad attitude from the first time she came to the table. So many good places to eat, this is not one of them"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Thanks especially to Morgan for making sure we were taken care of!"}
{"text":"Love this place! A group of us go about once a month to have drinks and dinner in the lounge area. The service is always quick and friendly. Lauren and Morgan took care of us last time and went above and beyond (I forgot a present in there and Morgan ran out to make sure I didn't forget!)! Will definitely continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Holy Amazing!
#1 This is my second time here and I live in Denver. 
#2 Brunch is delish and the drinks are just as good, if not better. 
#3 Drink you must try 'Paid Vacation'... let's just say it will get you 'buzzed'.
#4 Skyler was a treat... request her amazingness, if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday afternoon, sat at the bar and Nate was bartending. Very friendly and suggested the warm lobster roll (excellent.) Had an ice tea to drink and a kale salad as my side, the kale salad was a bit salty but still solid. Looked at the brunch menu and will definitely be back in. They also had a solid beer lineup, excited to come check it out with a group of friends on a weekend. 5 stars for service and lobster roll."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere, good drinks and just an overall awesome vibe. The bartenders are the best. Great place to go anytime of the week! Nate makes the best drinks!"}
{"text":"Loved lunch. Went with friends and shared Burrata, lobster role and tuna tartar with shredded cauliflower side. Outstanding food and great wait service. Had a banana Nutella crepe.  Am going for dinner this weekend!!"}
{"text":"Loved It! We came here on a Sunday and had brunch, which was delicious. Pineapple mimosa and Bloody Mary were good too. Cute ambiance, not crowded, and very reasonably priced!  Win-win. Definitely come here."}
{"text":"Dined here last Saturday and had the best service we have had eating out in a long time. Our server Margo was very fun, friendly and provided exemplary service. Nice to have someone that actually enjoys their job and it shows.
Great food, atmosphere and staff. The Burrata was spectacular and great clam chowder. Fun drink combinations! We will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"Order the tuna tartar and guacamole as well as the lobster roll! Both were excellent! Christina, who helped us provided an experience that should be held as a standard across all restaurants. It's very refreshing to receive quality service. 

I'd also recommend trying to the burrata if you have a couple of people to share things with. The general ambiance of the restaurant is pleasant to be in during the day and at night. They have nice live music in the evening (at pleasant volume).

I will undoubtedly come back here again."}
{"text":"Loved absolutely everything about this place!! The drinks were so great that we had very high expectations for the food but it was even better! The atmosphere is SO cute! I didn't want to leave!!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. Super cute, cozy vibe but way overpriced. Ordered a couple cocktails that did not seem to be mixed very well. Had the Caesar salad, mac and cheese and turkey + egg sandwich. Overall underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch this past weekend and had a great time! Our server, Morgan, was fantastic! He got us seated right away, suggested great drinks and provided excellent service. Thanks Morgan!!!"}
{"text":"To preface this review, we did not eat. We sat down at the bar, where the female bartender with long dark hair, which was down, greeted us and then proceeded to pull food out of her hair while she filled our glasses for waters. (Gross?) After she placed the drinks in front of us she walked down the bar, while still playing with her hair and made shots for guests in the restaurant. That's disgusting. I do not care to dine in an establishment that doesn't conduct proper hand washing. And picking things out of your hair in front of guests...you're not at your house, you're serving the public. And the drinks that we did receive tasted disgusting so I can only assume that the glassware was not properly washed. I would have told her about the issue but the bartender never came back over."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch!! Went with a group of girls for a final meal of a stagette weekend! Mimosa special was amazing....a bottle of bubbles and your choice of 3 juices! It's like having your own Mimosa bar at the table!  Reservation worked out really well as there was a line-up at the door (thank goodness we made a reso)  Interior is super cute and there is a great vibe! Live music was awesome!! Drinks and cocktails were great! Lobster rolls are good, but not the best Ive had.  Probably better to go with more \"breakfast\" options such as the crepes or breakfast sandwiches.  Atmosphere is worth it :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Best place in Old Town to grab a patio cocktail, enjoy the weather, & people watch. Super friendly staff, particularly Moriah. Try the whiskey smash or the sucker punch. Burstyn salad/app was perfect. Ty the Gm checked in on us to make sure our experience was perfect... Which it was."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch with a few coworkers. Asked our server marissa for some recommendations and she brought up the warm lobster roll. I went with it and I was pleasantly surprised. She was very nice and knowledgable. The environment was very cool with open windows and doors. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Arizona. Food on the menu is great. Lobster roll is perfect. Appetizers are great size and the flavors are good. No down side here."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch destination to kick off a girls trip.  Good menu, tasty food, and the staff went above and beyond - particularly Morgan and the chef.  From helping us navigate the cocktails to educating us on different cheeses, it was a true staff team effort with the friendliest of service even after being totally slammed the hour prior.  (Thanks again, Morgan!)  Recommendations include Rose Sangria, Ahi Poke Salad, and the Rock Shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"We had Alyssa as our server tonight we were a party of 18 and she did an amazing job, she always had a smile on her face, dealing with all females (enough said) overall great experience with Alyssa as our sever. Thank you for dealing with a bachelorette party we appreciate you."}
{"text":"This place looked awesome!! 
Ordered to-go.. Epic fried \"rice\" with lobster.
3 star bc my Togo order forgot salad dressing on what looked to be an epic salad.
Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Great service. Aly was amazing. Mike the GM was super sweet and accommodating. Enjoyed the whole experience! We had a group of people and we will totally return. Happy hour was fun!"}
{"text":"Eaten here several time, since it's across the street from work. Lunch. Always. 

Airly and spacious with a SoCal chill type vibe. This joint is right on the corner of Scottsdale & Stetson/Drinkwater so site-seeing is a big part of the sell here. High rent for sure. 

I've had the Lobster Roll once. It's served cold, and feels like it should be warm - I'm sure you could order it warm if you want. My go-to, here, is the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich. A-Mazing. I really can't order anything else or speak on anything else in fact. I'll continue to go back just for this sandwich, and contend that it's the best French Dip around. 

The \"talent' traveling a-foot around Old Town goes by (and in) The Montauk, and having a mouth full of prime rib french dip while spectating is a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"The only thing missing was the ocean view. This was our second time there. Both times we had a great experience. Our waitress, Michelle, was an absolute doll. She was pleasant and extremely attentive. I ordered the cold lobster roll. I enjoyed it both times I was there but this time was better then last time. My husband having celiac disease ordered the prime rib and egg sandwich without the bread. Michelle checked to make sure that his original side choice was gluten free... it was not.. so he chose another. He enjoyed it and said that is what he would order again. 

Having been to Montauk (the real town on Long Island in NY many times... you can take the girl out of NY..can't take NY out of the girl) the decor of the restaurant screams beach. We intend to return again...and again..."}
{"text":"The montauk is wonderful! I had an amazing time with my fiancé. I got the avocado salad with shrimp and he got the prime rib sandwich with Mac and cheese! Service was great. Our server was Marisa. She had great knowledge of the menu and was very sweet. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It is amazing to me how crowded a restaurant with below average food can be in this town. I'm giving it one star based on the potential that it may be a decent place to grab a drink. The service was non-attentive and slow and the food was mediocre at best. Salmon devil eggs lacked flavor. Breakfast sandwich egg was overlooked the potatoes where cold and the bun was coated in butter and soggy. The crepes looked like a pile of raw dough. I wouldn't even try them. My friend ate them because he was starving and didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for food. They better revamp soon or it will be a goner in less than 6 months."}
{"text":"The Montauk thinks it's a high end restaurant, but it's really a low end sports bar.  We were headed to Cowboy Ciao, but decided to try something new- big mistake.  

Decor is very tasteful, but that's where it ends- server hadn't been trained for the price point, and it showed- she was more suited for a Chili's.  Slammed our glasses down on the table with every delivery, and no napkins.  Shrimp ceviche was really just a plate of chopped shrimp- no vinegar, no tomatoes, no cucumbers, no lemongrass, no coconut, no flavor.  Cauliflower fried rice was just ok- oddly sweet, but bitter.

Lastly, very LOUD- most of the patrons had just returned from a pool party, and were there to party- Dos Gringos II, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we did not get to eat here on our bachelorette trip because they cancelled our reservation the day before. They said they would be closed for the 3rd of July. It was disappointing and inconvenient because we had to find another place last minute. It would have been nice of them to tell us when we called to make the initial reservation."}
{"text":"TOTAL GOAT RODEO!  I don't normally write restaurant reviews, but the Montauk has EARNED this one.  I made a walk-up reservation for an outside table (loud live music inside) with the host/hostess.  He  entered my cell number and I subsequently received a confirmation and to expect :30 to :45 minute wait, no problem, knew what we we were signing up for and it was very busy. An hour elapsed and I checked in again to see status of my reservation.  They had no record of me having even made the reservation and quickly placed the blame on ME for not being available when they called me up.  I showed the hostess the confirmation text, and confirmed that there was no communication beyond that.  ZERO apology! The only fix was to promise an outside table within 10 minutes.  Time elapsed with no outside table available, so we accepted an inside, only to be told by our waitress that the kitchen was \"backed up\" and that the minimum wait for service would be another :30 minutes.  OUT!"}
{"text":"We were there at 6pm.The hostess seem like didn't want to take us in,she told our wait time was 30mins.After 10mins,we asked again with different host,he seated us right away.At 615pm,Loud music n drinking ppl was already filled the restaurant.It is not kids friendly,it's pub like atmosphere.We had Grilled chicken sandwich,the chicken was over dried;Fish & Chip,The fish was cold;only impressed was Tuner Tarter Guacamole."}
{"text":"Fun vibe for day drinking! Nice and cool inside especially in the AZ heat. Great staff, awesome food, love the decor, and delicious cocktails. Shout out to our serve Moriah and the manager Mikey!!"}
{"text":"Came in today/tonight 4/25/17 for Happy Hour sat at bar and was pleasantly surprised at the speed of service. My glass was never empty and my wings were perfect. Great place for a Tuesday or any day Happy Hour....Make sure you see Candice the bartender for best service ever"}
{"text":"I visited Scottsdale for spring training with my girlfriends and we loved coming to the Montauk for dinner! Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant.. it had a laidback, but still upscale vibe. The food was delicious (loved the cauliflower fried rice), and the service was exceptional. Our waiter, Morgan, really solidified my positive review. I will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, worst deviled eggs I've ever had in my life. Absolutely horrible. Brought out the wrong beers, but if you are just for just drinks this place rocks. Super unimpressed by the food.. Good prices. 

My two stars are for the atmosphere. Food really was not good."}
{"text":"Food was OK- ambience good, service happy and good, the only reason I'm posting a review is because the female wait staff are dressed in shorts so short they crawl up their butt crack exposing their butt cheeks. They look ridiculous while the male wait staff is dressed in jeans and black shirts. 

When will women stop this garbage? My digestive juices are not stimulated by the constant barrage of butt cracks and cleavage. It's really soft porn without the dollar bills and insulting to patrons. 

I won't revisit."}
{"text":"First off we waited at front door ten minutes last Sunday while the host was talking with bartenders and servers by the back bar. When he finally came up he didn't apologize just said what can I help you with? Umm I guess a table. Then got a table and waited 8 yes 8 minutes for someone to come up to us to have zero smile on there face and ask what we wanted without menu's. This is my 3rd time there and staff is unpleasant and rude. Your in the service industry people!!!! The food. Horrible and over priced. Drinks are the same. All 3 of us thought the exact same thing. If you like live music and not being able to talk to the people you are sitting with inside this is the place to be. Go next door to breakfast club or places down the street. Never making this mistake again."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite brunch spot on sundays! The burritos are HUGE and DELICIOUS! Theres great live music and a DJ, and the spark plug was the perfect drink to get my day started. Proud to be a regular"}
{"text":"Five star Morgan! 

Amazing brunch place with delectable plates such as deconstructed bruschetta and crepes to die for. Amazing service and mimosas! I felt at home in the beautiful New England decor, and I will return often. Our servers name was Morgan and he was both attentive and knowledgeable and quick. So pleased with my service and my full tummy!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of taking my wife to The Montauk last night. Having spent some time in the Hamptons and the Northeast, I must say these guys nailed it. The atmosphere and decor is spot on and the food was awesome. Our waiter was a perfect gentlemen and was very respectful. Il music wasn't too loud but loud enough to enjoy. TVs are placed in the perfect spots and the restaurant pours out to the patio effortlessly as if on the coast. I'll definitely be back. An easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Our server Logan was awesome! I recommend the Brussel Sprout Tacos, the Deviled Eggs, and the Tuna Tartare Guac! You won't be disappointed! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and enjoy the food.  Good stuff. 
However,  it took forever to get a drink. On this occasion there was a girl, blonde hair, don't know her name, who was just unpleasant to me. The facial expression she had throughout our visit looked as if she was smelling shit the entire time. She obv is superior to me in social status and treated us that way. Was also  slow to get me water and menu. I observed ppl come after me and get these items before me. Also watched the difference in how she treated them as to how she treated me. It was obvious I didn't peak her interest. I wanted to speak to a manager about this but when I  got one he smelled like weed, and I didn't even waste my time. It was pretty much a pre game for him as I saw him have a few drinks over the course of my visit. I won't return, nor will my colleagues."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were great. The shrimp bowl was amazing as well, just wish it didn't so much of a creamy taste to the rice. Overall, it was a busy fun sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Super cute and fun vibes! Always a good place for delicious drinks and snacks! I personally like their brunch menu better than dinner. Our server Marisa was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Always a great time, but the blonde bartender on Monday was super attentive and sweet. There were pretty busy but my glass was always full! I will be back for brunch this weekend, thank you Blondie!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing Day celebrating Mother's Day with Morgan as our Server, seriously ask for him.  I highly recommend the avocado toast for brunch. Cheers (insert Champagne glass clink)  for such a great overall experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service, cold food on a Tuesday night! Out of wine glasses, had to ask several times for a wine  refill and silverware. The cauliflower fried rice was barely warm. Ugh"}
{"text":"Came for brunch for my bachelorette party, they sat us at a very nice table right near the front. The table side mimosas and fresh squeezed juices were amazing, and the bloody Mary's were some of the best we've ever had! The service and food were great as well, definitely recommend this place for a special event or just a weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"First time since RE named.  Great upgrade.  Fish tacos are nice.  Always liked this place before...  Still like it!  Perfect corner for hanging out on a warm afternoon."}
{"text":"So we started here just before happy hour and Jessie gave us a quick heads up we should try and order quick. Unfortunately we missed the cutoff but a few cocktails later Jessie and her manager Joel had us covered and took care of us on the total tab. If you haven't tried the cauliflower fried rice you are missing out - the bomb. Wish I had a pic. Great beers to. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was great, the Lobster roll really buttered my biscuit! Morgan's service was top notch, I would give him a 10/10. I am going to tell everyone about the Montauk in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome place! We sat on the patio last night and enjoyed a few drinks and appetizers. Gorgeous remodel, outstanding service and menu! Our server was so knowledgably and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I am not one to write reviews, but after my experience at the Montauk I felt I had to. Went into the Montauk the other day with a couple of buddies. We first sat down at a table and had an attractive blonde server (I believe her name was Aly). She gave us excellent service and made sure we were taken care of the entire night. Consistently checked in on us, brought all of our food and drinks in a timely manner, and overall just a great personality. If only every server were  this great at every restaurant. After closing out with Aly we left and ended up coming back later that night. This time we sat at the bar and the bartenders Candice and Caitlin (both cute girls) helped us out. Again nothing but excellent service and a great/friendly personalities. They recommended a series of great drinks and before we knew it was midnight and we had been sitting there hanging out for 2.5 hours. Again, I wish all bartenders were this good and cool. Overall would definitely recommend Montauk and take all of my friends and family there. Awesome atmosphere and great people! Definitely my new go to place."}
{"text":"EPIC FAIL. horrible service, food was bland. We arrived and were immediately met with insanely loud club music,  huh? We opted to sit outside to escape the music. We ordered a bloody mary which never came. Lunch took over 30 mins to arrive and when it did they brought  only my husbands food and said my order  was on a second check. What?  so I'm  just sitting there without food. And no silverware to boot! When my food finally came, the macaroni was literally just melted American cheese over pasta noodles. We asked for the check which took 10 minutes, after getting sick of waiting we just put cash on table and left. Horrible service, like really bad. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Morgan, the manager, recognized my husband and I  from a previous visit, and was our server, a fun guy.
I had the Avocado & Punk Grapefruit salad with chicken. It was fresh with a jalapeño dressing giving it a great flavor. My husband had the Grilled Kebabs, herb chicken. He loved the favor.  One of his sides, seasonal veggie, turned out to be Brussels sprouts that were amazing! You must try them!!  Drinks are awesome, especially the Greyhound!"}
{"text":"Christina was an amazing waitress! Great recommendations and the food came out fast. Everything I've had has been absolutely delicious. I recommend the chicken or lobster cauliflower fried rice."}
{"text":"My son and I had a fair experience here.  Love the bacon in the bloody mary and my warm lobster roll was very good although for $20 there was very little lobster.  The roll they use is too sweet, in my humble opinion.  The solo guy who was the live entertainment was very good and our server was sweet. My son ate half his crepes with bacon and an egg on top. It was not an awesome experience...it was an \"ok\" one."}
{"text":"Amazing service thanks to Morgan, food was awesome, will continue to come back.

So far it's my favorite place to brunch in a Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really liked the food and the atmosphere. The tuna tartare and guacamole is amazing! The drinks are a little over priced, but yet what do you expect in old town."}
{"text":"The lobster roll was great and drinks were better. Christina was an awesome waitress!"}
{"text":"Went on a double date with friends.  We wanted to try a bit of everything.  Our server, Alyssa, was fantastic.  We tried the fish and chips, which is an entree, as an appetizer.  We received three tiny pieces of fish and a small handful of chips.  The taste was okay, but very disappointed in the portion size.  We loved the Lobster Mashed Potatoes!  The Jalapeño Honey Chicken Sandwich was delicious.  I've not seen another restaurant in the valley have Lobster Rolls so my hubby was happy.  I think The Montauk is best for brunch."}
{"text":"I thought I had first stepped into a Cape Cod beachside restaurant,  but then. ...it was the Montauk.  This place used to be The Bungalow.  Gone is the dark wood work and replaced with lighter decor and cool metal chairs.  

I want to first give a shout out to the great staff and our server (Mary I think her name was).  Multiple staff greeting us during our visit as well -  you can tell they place an emphasis on customer service.  

We only stayed for Happy Hour, but I'd strongly recommend the kobe crumb mac and cheese and crispy chicken drum sticks.  Both were cooked to perfection, if I wouldn't have drawn attention to myself I probably would have licked the bowl that the mac and cheese came in.

Thanks for a great experience Montauk - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to this restaurant for giving us crappy service that we discovered Diego Pops. Go there instead. We only minded the really loud club music on Sunday at noon after we were seated and waited 10 min for no one to acknowledge us. Ashley, the hostess, lacked a sense of urgency and sensitivity towards ensuring customers were happy. The waitress in our section, with tray in hand (booging to Ellie Goulding), preferred to wait at a booth while her friend pulled up something on her mobile phone and bus a table, than to take our order. The random employee that dropped off our water needs to go get an office job where she doesn't deal with the general public. If you don't like people, don't work in a restaurant where people go to have a great time while eating good food. This is the 3rd time we have been at the restaurant, and it appears this place operates better when there are 10-15 customers. Anything more than that, don't bother. The floor manager needs to have additional training on how to ensure customers are well taken care of, attitudes are left at the employee entrance, and that customers don't walk away."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the weakest drink in Scottsdale this is your place. Ordered jack and coke got a glass of coke for $10. Then food came out everything was cold stay away."}
{"text":"Chicken crepe was delicious! Morgan was the friendliest server and the atmosphere is perfect for a little day drinking !"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! And the best atmosphere ever! Best place for Sunday Funday or brunch"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a great place to eat. Really cool environment but I had a hard time enjoying myself because our server was a mess. Anytime I asked her something she seemed like she had no idea what she was talking about... I really like this place but my last time there was horrible other than that time I always have fun there!"}
{"text":"Do not order the honey jalapeño chicken unless you like liquid peanut brittle. The buffalo fries were good, and the prime rib sandwich was good. Also we got free drinks because our order was confused for a while. I'd come back, but I wouldn't order the same thing."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with my dad and was very disappointed. We first got there and saw a sea of empty tables and the manager said it was a 10 minute wait. About a minute after, a waiter came up and told us that we could sit wherever we wanted. After sitting down, the manager came to us and said it was a 10 minute wait and that we should not have sat down, and then we told him the waiter told us we could sit wherever and he became angry and went to yell at the waiter. The waiter was a very nice guy, but seemed undertrained. It seemed like a managing issue.

We ordered drinks and I ordered a coffee, then we ordered food and the waiter said there was a backup with the coffee machine and it might take longer. I got my food, which was good except for the toast that was so hard it scratched the top of my mouth, and it was a very small portion for what we paid for. Still no coffee. The waiter said the coffee machine was still backed up. I finished my food and told the waiter to just not worry about the coffee. 

This place has a good environment and great location but needs some serious work with management. It was quite amazing to me how a restaurant who serves brunch couldn't get the coffee machine to work."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, loved the atmosphere and the food was fantastic. We had the burrata appetizer and it was out of this world. We also had the kale salad and it was the best kale salad I've had."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch today before hitting up spring training. We sat at the bar outside for a few drinks. The blonde with the glasses was awesome. She recommended the grapefruit cocktail and it was perfect. The food did take a little while, but it was worth the wait. Had the lobster roll this time, and I'm looking forward to trying everything else next time."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery service, it was fast and the driver was very nice, I ordered clam chowder and a prime rib sandwich, the sandwich was hot and tasty, unfortunately they forgot the clam chowder and the fries were a little cold, however when I called, ....and this is why they get 4 stars, they were very nice and didn't try tell me I was wrong. Michael was very adamant on wanting to make sure my order was done right, he delivered as promised, the only thing stopping me from a 5 star rating is they forgot the clam chowder when I first ordered, but I will order again, food was good and service was even better, thx you guys for not making it difficult!!! Good job"}
{"text":"Best spot in Scottsdale!!! The food and ambiance are exceptional. My friends and I always come here and know we'll have a great time and eat delicious food.  I highly recommend The Montauk to anyone! 5 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was great! Went to brunch with my roommate and we had a great time there! We were sat at a table where it was more like a lounging area. We had to kinda had to lean over and bend down to eat our food but it was okay overall. Will be going there again soon!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service I've seen in years.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY
I came in with my wife and daughter.  We ordered a couple draft beers.  They took over 15 minutes to bring them, mind you it's not busy.  We also ordered 2 apps since we assumed it would take quite a while at this point.  One app was the shrimp.  After waiting over 40 more minutes the waitress drops off the tuna.  5 minutes after that they come back to tell us they don't have the shrimp at all in stock.  The food was less than impressive and the service was horrible.  Hope this is enough detail so this restaurant doesn't get to remove my review"}
{"text":"Wow. Avocado grapefruit salad was super refreshing. Chicken fried cauliflower rice was as good as my homemade Paleo version. Great spot--clearly trendy for the tanned middle class Scottsdale types. Music was a little weird. Phantogram then suddenly some nineties \"Finally it happened to me\" jam. What's that about anyway. So, food is good, eat here. Maybe bring earplugs."}
{"text":"Thank you Candace for such great service! You made our dining experience awesome! Enjoyed brunch with a punch bowl and it definitely did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I came in on Friday night after work with some friends. The hostess who greeted us was adorable and smiley. She did her best to seat us right away seeing there was a wait for inside. I believe there was another host working, but she didn't seem to do much at all. I remember asking her for ice at one point and she couldn't even manage that. It seemed like she got cut early- with no shock there. We were prepared for the bar-like atmosphere at around 8:30 on a Friday night- no complaints there but woah- were they busy. Good music was on but a buddy of mine noticed something interesting after we ordered. The original hostess was shockingly more interested in the well being of the customers and restaurant then just about anyone else in that place. She was greeting, cleaning, filling waters- the whole 9. We weren't sure why she wasn't a waitress there seeing as we talked to her more than the person we were actually tipping. Anyway, the waitress that was assigned to us wasn't awful, just seemed very busy with a few other tables- understandable. I had the lobster roll, which I get just about every time I go there and surprisingly, it has gotten better with time. The rest of the group got drinks and had a pretty good night. We figured we'd give that host a tip to commend her for keeping up with that crazy place. Countless dudes at the bar kept trying to get her attention, but she didnt spend much time entertaining them which was impressive and (funny to watch). Checking up on customers is key in the industry. Also, the table next to us was a group of Air Force fighter pilots' wives. They ended up telling us that the host brought the table out desserts free of charge to thank them and their husbands for their service. Unheard of. If They don't keep her, I'll offer her an internship myself! We will definitely be back next Friday"}
{"text":"The avocado grapefruit salad is one of the most refreshing salads I have ever experienced. The tuna tartare is a generous portion and the lobster anything is amazing. Staff is polite, ambiance is eclectic. It's a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I don't have one bad thing to say. I had a great time both visits. Great music, great food...great vibe! I'd recommend to anyone looking for an overall great time!"}
{"text":"The garlic fries.,,,,,O. M. G. !  Super clean, my server Marissa was so fun and efficient. Love this place! Order the margarita!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Well situated in the heart of Scottsdale it is simply a great stop for locals and tourists alike . Decor is a mixed of the modern beach classic with some New England flair to it as well but pays homage to the name of the quintessential town in Long Island NY. 

Service was impeccable and they delivered on all fronts and the food was very well priced for the quality. I would definitely recommend this place. My only gripe was the music was way too loud for brunch. I get it is a party spot at night but there is no real need for it at brunch"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch an it was pretty yummy. A little over priced for drinks and could've used some sauce for the creeps and maybe a Benedict brunch option. Overall the staff was great and I liked the environment. I'll go back and try a different meal option."}
{"text":"Love this place !! The best atmosphere, cool patio , gorgeous place !!

The service was amazing , drinks are yummy and Kale Salad is the bomb !!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting spot. Reminds me of a California beach house. I can see Zack Morris and company hitting the bar at this place.

Aside from the look of this place not much else to keep a customer interested. I ordered the cold lobster roll and a corona . The roll was a hawaiian sweet roll. The lobster was pretty bland and didn't have much mayo. It came with a side of white milk that they called butter. Not sure how that's possible since it was flavorless. I asked for Mac and cheese for a side . It was tasty but the macaroni was a little undercooked, and this is from someone who likes his pasta al dente.

The staff was somewhat attentive but not what I would expect for it being as empty as it was during lunch. The bartenders even had time for some horsing around with each other. No conversation was had beyond the food and drink.

Lastly the prices are pretty average for Scottsdale but still overpriced for the quality of food and service. Ive been here more than once and say the biggest problem is consistency. I'm not too sure if I would return.

Tip: Avoid weekends if you don't like crowds or noise. They blare music during \"brunch.\""}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but I wouldn't say it was my best dining experience. As someone that doesn't eat animal products, the only thing they offered on the menu was a salad. I asked the waiter to have in come without bacon or cheese and they brought it with both bacon and cheese. I sent it back and then they brought it without the bacon, but still with cheese. By the time I finally got my meal everyone had already finished eating."}
{"text":"I saw more people walking out of here after 3 or 4 minutes than ordering food... I came after lunch hours on a Sunday. Not very busy compared to nearly every other place around. Not so much understaffed as disorganized. Empty tables hadn't been cleaned for the next guests. The bartenders weren't busy but spent the whole time complaining about the (very) large build up of dirty glasses. (They started to place dirty glasses right in front of me at the bar while eating...) apparently only the bar back knows how to use the sink and a sanitizer... I was a bit confused until the manager came out to the bar. Unkempt and looking hungover, he didnt seem to provide any guidance or value."}
{"text":"Came in for some beer and food to celebrate Labor Day. The staff was amazing- thank you Kerry Simon, Michael and Morgan for your friendliness and dining recommendations. I had such a fun night and will definitely be back. I will also make sure to let all my friends know how much I enjoyed my experience.

Also, Zach M, I was there during your experience. The manager was nothing but nice to you and was simply letting you know that the kitchen was closing at 9. You showed up at 8 and had an hour to order then another hour to enjoy the atmosphere. You decided to cause the scene for no reason."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. Gets crowded with young crowd at night. Lunch is more of a business type scene and hung over young people. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Not much for funky eclectic food and few healthy options. I was unimpressed although service was good.

{"text":"We came with a big party for a birthday brunch  on a Sunday and the staff was totally unprepared. We waited 45 minutes for a drink and nearly two hours since we sat down for food. I give credit to one of the owners for helping us, but get it together. The food was good but we were hANGRY. Come on."}
{"text":"This our favorite new breakfast/brunch spot!  The Breakfast Sandwich was unbelievably good as was the clam chowder. The staff was as excellent as the food as well."}
{"text":"Tried Montauk first for happy hour. We ordered an assortment of items and loved all of our selections. Came back for lunch and had the yummy fish tacos with kale salad. Charming beachy atmosphere, airy and comfortable, Going back soon!"}
{"text":"We arrived on day two of Breakfast-for-the-first-time!  Waited more than 30 minutes for coffee cups and coffee. Had to send back dirty coffee cups twice, so gave up on coffee. Breakfast arrived room temperature...about an hour later. We will pass on this place for future breakfast plans. We watched folks at BC across the street wait to be seated as we waited for more than an hour for our very mediocre breakfast order to arrive...we were envious because we know at least at the end of their breakfast, there was real breakfast food."}
{"text":"My friends threw a birthday party for me here Jan the 26th. I had a great time. The food was absolutely amazing and all my guests seem to really enjoy it. We had delicious chicken sliders, rock shrimp, various tacos and these Parmesan potato chips that melt in your mouth! The lounge space they set us up in was perfect and spacious, great for an event. Also the service was over the top. The entire staff was accommodating and they all went above and beyond to continue to check on me and my guests in such a friendly manner. I would definitely do another event there or just go for happy hour! Thank you Montauk for making my event a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick drink after dinner down the street and was more than pleased...the ambiance, music (there was a DJ since it is Friday), the cocktails (I am almost always a wine drinker) but most of all the bartender(s).  Go see Patrick S if you want a friendly, entertaining and talented gentleman to make your drinks, it is because of him that we will be back..."}
{"text":"Overpriced food, but a good looking crowd. Too bad the service is also horrible. If you're looking for a so-called hot spot is passed it's passed it prime... Go to Montauk."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Shoestring fries, lobster roll, kale salad. Get it all!! Drinks at HH are pretty good too"}
{"text":"Alyssa was such an awesome server! She was very attentive and helpful when we asked her about certain dishes. 10/10 would recommend the Montauk and definitely ask for Alyssa!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot!

It's right in scottsdale near the mall right next door to diego pops.

Cool Hamptons vibe inside. Even has a mini lounge area in the middle.

Waitress was really friendly - forgot her name though.

We got the Haystack fries as an app - they were huge! seriously enough for 3-4 people. Pretty bomb too. 

I had the lobster roll - warm which was great. Good amount of lobster and the roll was really good too. It came with a kale salad. The kale salad was pretty good and i like the lemon vinaigrette and the stuff they put in it. Much better than the lame side salads at most places 

Dessert : nutella + banana crepe : too much banana and not enough nutella - it was Okay. Definately ask for extra nutella

All in all a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"I made reservations for a party of 20 , two weeks in advance.  Was told we'd have the patio and if it rained we'd be moved inside to the lounge with no problems. Got there at 6:15 for a 6:30 reservation and was greeted with a \" Well, you're early.\"  Seriously?  Nothing was ready for a party of TWENTY. It was pouring rain  and I told them we needed to be seated inside, as per my conversation with Morgan two days before the party.  Nope. \" We're booked inside. You get the patio.  That's what the reservation book says.\" They scrambled to wipe off tables and chairs and get the heaters started. We finally got seated outside and it started to pour. The roof was leaking, the heaters were dropping burning hot water on people, and the rain was blowing into the patio area. After another conversation with the grumpy jerk of a manager, we got moved inside.  The manager on duty that night was rude and argumentative.  He asked us when we were leaving so he could seat someone else at our tables!  He said \" Your reservation was for the patio until 10:30, not the inside.\" What a jerk. He glared at us until we finally all cashed out and left.  It was a birthday party and it should have been noted in the reservation. It wasn't.  We weren't even offered dessert. Not even for the birthday guest. 
Food was good. Waitresses were mediocre.  I had to ask for my change after she left with my cash and never returned. Needless to say, we'll never go back."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant from the road and decided to stop. On the good part, the location is very good and the ambience is very good. The place is well decorated and has a nice outdoor seating area. The one bad part about the setting is the music. The volume was way too loud for people to talk to each other. That might be OK for Saturday night but this was Sunday morning brunch.

Unfortunately this appears to be a restaurant that is put a lot more attention into their decorating them into either their food or their service. They messed up both my order and my wife's order. They brought her appetizers out after they brought the food out. And one of the dishes with fish was undercooked. Overall it wasn't worse place we've ever been but it was definitely not a place we will try again."}
{"text":"In the desert, the name Montauk conjures images of the beach, lighthouses, etc. The light blue hues, whites, wood floors and wicker furniture all give an anticipated air of a serene and enjoyable time. If you see where I'm going, forget it, because The Montauk is not the place. After months of driving by wanting to try the restaurant, we finally decided to stop by for a Saturday lunch. What better place to have a relaxed lunch, right? Wrong. The Montauk may LOOK serene, but the actual vibe is anything but. Blasting music from a DJ at 11:45 am? I think not. Now, maybe it's because I'm over 30, which everyone else in the place was not; however, The Montauk doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. And the food was just okay. Actually rather flavorless, at least the salads and breakfast sandwiches. Also, if you like mac-n-cheese, you should give theirs a try, but I warn you it has a very smokey taste -- almost like it has pork in it, which for someone who does not eat pork, it was rather disappointing. As for service, our server had to yell and us back at her in order for everyone to hear over the music. The guy who brought the mac-n-cheese appetizer to our table just placed the bowl in the middle of the table. No plates, no spoon to serve. 

I won't be back... ever."}
{"text":"Super friendly waitress and amazing watermelon mules!  Nice atmosphere sitting out back!!"}
{"text":"Really sad I waited to try this place on our last day in town. The place is really cute with some open areas to enjoy the Arizona weather. Love music which was great and lively. We tried their specialty cocktails - endless summer was one delish! We decided to split the burrata and lobster roll - SOO good. I can only imagine that everything else on the menu is just as good! Service was good."}
{"text":"So we had just landed into Phoenix, we had been up since about 3 a.m. Phoenix time (6 a.m. Cleveland time), so we were tired, hungry and just wanted some food. It was a Sunday, and brunch sounded really good. So we are driving around Old Scottsdale, and decided to get out and walk to find a restaurant. One of the first restaurants we happened upon the The Montauk, and it looked like a really good menu. So we go up and ask how long the wait is. Now, we are dressing in tshirt and leggings basically ... comfy clothes that we flew in. Well one of the hostesses eyes us up and down and tells us that they are full. Then another one interjects and said that they have a table they can seat us at right away. 

So we go in, and let me tell you, they had the music up like you were in a nightclub. It was 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday. You could not hear the music from the road, so it was very deceiving. It was so loud though, and they had a DJ set up in the booth. I mean, it was kinda cool, but just not what we were expecting for a Sunday morning brunch. Plus it was really hard to hear, and that's a lot coming from a 24-year-old. 

It took forever for a server to get to us. She was really nice, but she was overwhelmed, and so we saw her few and far inbetween. On the plus side, we did get some great food and some good cocktails to start our vacation. Maybe if we were a little bit more prepared for what we were going into, or if we hadn't been looked up and down and deemed \"unfit\" to eat there initially, I would have enjoyed the experience more."}
{"text":"Great food and huge servings. Was a little disappointed that such a nice place didn't serve cappuccinos or espresso of any kind, but otherwise everything was good. Beautiful interior and patio space in the front and back! Service was also good - no complaints!"}
{"text":"This place wins as my new favorite on this visit to Scottsdale! Wins for cutest, friendliest waiters, great food and fun vibe. I had the crispy Brussels sprouts as a starter and the shrimp bowl for my meal. Both delicious! I'll be back next visit!"}
{"text":"The Montauk's patio is popping and is the downtown locale for quality people watching. We stopped in on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. The service was a bummer despite a less than full house. The cocktails were extremely on point and strong. The entrees were well portioned and had great, creative flavor. However some rookie missteps: extremely burnt brown rice, unseasoned potato chips. Overall the experience was fair... next time we'll just come for the fancy AF fish bowl cocktail and stay for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome!  A little disappointed in the menu selection for breakfast. Feel like they needed a granola or yogurt option for those not too hungry. Really bummed that they won't allow dogs on the patio. I will probably choose other breakfast venues because of that.  But, again, I do love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try this place out but unfortunately we never got to try it. 

We were immediately seated by a really nice hostess outside to a table. We then looked over the menu for 15 minutes and not one person came to give us water or take our order. The waiter came by he table next to us 3 different times and didn't say one word to us. 

I Understand this is a new restaurant but with so many choices in old town the service needs a reality check. May give another shot but maybe not..."}
{"text":"The staff is absolutely the worst customer service in old town you'll be sitting there at the bar right in front of their view and they won't even look up to acknowledge that you're there when clearly they know you're there but why not at least say hello I'll be with you in a few minutes rather than just ignore people I love the atmosphere and the place but I hate going in there because I know every time the service is going to be shitty and it takes forever attention in service and if you think it's hard getting your first drink ordered wait till you want your second drink the service is still just a slow and Inattentive"}
{"text":"Always great service and food! Trendy place but wouldn't suggest bringing kids here. If you're planning on having a quiet meal then this place isn't for you. Not saying it's loud, but it IS in Old Town after all and some people are or get rowdy."}
{"text":"Jess was awesome! She knew exactly what our group would love. Food was great, get the chicken with cauliflower rice!"}
{"text":"My friend and I absolutely loved The Montauk! We went on a Tuesday at 11:00, right when they opened. We sat at the outside bar and were met by a very friendly bartender. She was extremely accommodating during our time there, starting by providing us with a phone charger device. We had just traveled and needed some juice in our phones. 

We began with a couple of drinks. My friend ordered a glass of Rose and I ordered the Rose Sangria. Both were fabulous! The bartender also made sure to keep our waters full throughout our time there. 

We decided to try some appetizers while here also. We first tried the Roasted Garlic Hummus, which came with pieces of soft, yet toasted bread that was to die for. It also had carrots and celery on the plate. The restaurant was gracious enough to provide us with more bread and veggies when we ran out. Next, we ordered the Fried Chicken Sliders that had a slaw on it that was sweet. Again, another outstanding dish. 

This place was a great way to kick off our week in Scottsdale and we would definitely go back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Very slow service during regular hours with half of the tables open. Waited 45 minutes for drinks before even ordering. After ordering we were told they were sold out of avocados and most of their beer selection; can't even be basic. Just go to Diego pops next door"}
{"text":"Why would you call yourself The Montauk and not have anything on the menu representing Montauk? All of the lobster is previously frozen tails from???? Clams are not in the Shell? Must be canned!! Service was so bad, (Sage) we waited 15 minutes for a glass of water, then left after 20 minutes waiting for a cocktail. Never got to place a food order. Place was not busy for 8:30 on a Thursday. Won't be back, and can tell this place in a great location in Scottsdale won't last long."}
{"text":"Mariah, was absolutely great. We had a couple birthdays when we went on August 13th, and Mariah treated us as though we were the only people there. 

If you are looking for a fun atmosphere with great food, this is the place to be. The breakfast club next door is not worth wait, when you have Montauk next door."}
{"text":"This place is lit. Lowkey the domestic Scottsdale joint west of the Mississippi. Our waitress Ariana was a blessing sent from heaven. We highly recommend their Spark Plug Asa great start to the day."}
{"text":"The nautical/beach decor is lovely at this restaurant! I only had the kale salad, which was okay, but the cocktails were superb! Our waitress was so friendly & even gave our table a round of shots in honor of my sisters birthday! I did sample my sisters fish & chips and enjoyed the fish and corn that came with the dish! Will definitely return to sample other dishes."}
{"text":"Overall everything was just okay! The place itself was very nice and a fun environment to be in. The drinks were delicious and fun because they have so many cocktails to choose from. The food however wasn't too great. My mac and cheese was average and a bit cold when I got it, and all the dishes were very expensive. It seemed like we were paying for the appearance of the place rather than the food quality. Overall we had fun here with the cool music they played!"}
{"text":"Super energetic, fun vibe. Beats are pumping, drinks are flowing. Cauliflower \"Fried Rice\" changes my life every time and Trade Secret is my libation of choice."}
{"text":"Fabulous Sunday brunch! Beautiful patio and live music playing inside. Great service and good food. I had the bacon and egg crepe with crispy potatoes. Yum! My hubby had the avocado toast with an extra egg (it comes with just one.) Green tea was delish. Menu looks amazing: hot and cold lobster rolls! Gotta go back and try those."}
{"text":"Great service but a bit overprice for food (I believe that is to be expected in this area). Great list of drink options. The atmosphere is very relaxed with a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Good service & cocktails. Good food. Creative menu. I had cauliflower rice with egg & rib eye. Was delicious.  Generous slices of steak. Spouse had small plates:  deviled eggs & rock shrimp. Both were very good. Nice portion sizes for small plates. Look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Mediocre in every way. Warm beer, chewy chicken combined with an elitist atmosphere. It lives up to its name."}
{"text":"Talk about trendy. Love the Hamptons style decor! Ordered a kale salad which was good. However, I would say this place is better for drinks and meeting people/people watching."}
{"text":"Slipped in for a late lunch and was happy to find out that the happy hour menu was available. The entire place was empty except for 3 other diners at the bar.

The place has a Hamptons vibe and the restaurant has a great patio for people watching.

We weren't that hungry and decided to order 2 clam chowders and split a burger. Our clam chowders at $4 was a smoking deal and was a nice hearty portion. This chowder was so good, full of clams and goodies that not only did we eat our portion but we ordered two to go. The chowder also came with two nicely sized crackers to break or dip into the chowder.

The only time I've had chowder this good is when I go to Boston or Connecticut for business.

Yeah it was that good.

When our burger came up, we were honestly already full so splitting it was a good idea. The burger was cooked medium well (although we asked for medium) and had a nicely grilled BBQ flavor. The burger also came with fries. The fries were also of a hearty portion and very tasty. They had a great texture on the outside and were soft on the inside.

There was no skimping in portions or taste at this place.

Overall the service was good, the food nicely presented and for just the few items we ordered, we know that we will return."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch and they had good service. If you want healthy food stop here for their cauliflower rice."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 3 stats because this place totally redeemed themselves for their mess up, but I just can't for a few reasons. I called weeks prior and made a patio table reservation for dinner for 16 people, a Bachelorette party visiting from out of town. This place came highly recommended from a couple friends so I was excited to check it out! 
It was St Pattys Day.. by 7:30 we walked up and the restaurant was bumping, the DJ was so loud inside you literally wouldn't have been able to have a conversation. I saw they had a big table set up right next to the bar and told them we definitely don't want to sit inside because our reservation was for the patio. After 10-15 mins of waiting, yes all 16 of us there, they told us we could wait on the front patio and order a drink because our table wasn't ready yet. After ordering drinks and waiting for another probably 15 mins we were told the owner showed up and wanted our table... pretty sure any business owner who cared about their patrons wouldn't take over their table, but that's just my thinking! I spoke privately to the person who was communicating with us and kinda called him on this BS, he was super nice and said he would try to work things out. Another 10 minutes later he said our original table was ready and apologized by bringing us complimentary champagne, very nice gesture! The service was great, they brought apps out immediately - considering we waited about 45 minutes for a reservation, but unfortunately some of the food was SUPER salty. Warm lobster roll, not good. Brussel sprout tacos, yuck. The cauliflower rice dishes tasted like a whole bottle of soy sauce spilt into it. I would recommend a lot of the small plates: hummus, buffalo fries, ahi nachos and wings. The cheeseburger was really good too. All in all, I'm super grateful they redeemed themselves and worked it out along with taking care of some things off of our bill, but all of that never should've happened in the first place. If in fact the owner really wanted to take over our table, makes me not want to give this establishment the time of day again. It was Dante and our sweet server, didn't get her name- who made the experience go from a negative to a positive."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Food was excellent! Great music and vibes. Will be coming here very often!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I always go with the mac and cheese, add truffle oil. Soooo yum. You also can't go wrong with the cocktails and/or mimosas- they offer a variety of flavors, which is a major plus. Overall, the portions are massive and the prices are reasonable, and if you go at prime time they have entertainment. You can't lose!"}
{"text":"The ambience is great, the food is good and arrives quickly, but the service needs improvement. I booked a table for a friends birthday and asked for a patio table. It  was ready when I got there, but I sat without anyone coming over for 10 minutes. There were servers attending to the other tables on the patio, but none of them gave my table so much as a glance. When I found a manager and asked for service, he said he would have someone come right over. Nope. When I finally got up and asked one of the servers if this was her table she said \"it could be\". She did an overall good job BUT questioned the tip when we paid!"}
{"text":"What a great spot to eat and feel like you're dining in the Hamptons without having to be in New York!

The ambiance is super relaxed with a beach-like classy atmosphere. We sat at one of the outdoor shaded tables in cushy plush couches.  

We came out for lunch and had a warm lobster roll, kale salad, lobster mac n cheese, and shoe string fries. Everything was so delicious and we easily cleared our plates!! Satiated with a smile on our faces. :)"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately but sat for 20 minutes without being acknowledged, given a menu or offered water. We left."}
{"text":"I went to the Montauk for a friend's birthday. We had a very large group (15+) so they sat us at the couches near the back of the restaurant. This location would've been great if we were just having drinks, but it was really awkward and uncomfortable for eating dinner. I understand that we had a gigantic group however, so that may have been the only space we fit. The air conditioning was broken in our space and we had to request that it be looked into several times. Eating seafood in muggy stagnant atmosphere is not the most enjoyable experience. The food was pretty good, but really overpriced, even for old town. I would go back again for cocktails but it was not a great experience with a large party."}
{"text":"We just got back from a fabulous weekend brunch at The Montauk. Instead of our usual temptation to order a traditional breakfast, my wife and I threw caution to the wind. We began by sharing a generous bowl of one of the best clam chowders we have ever had, including some of the best along the New England Coast. 

Then we shared the warm lobster roll to our great pleasure. The perfectly toasted bun was loaded with large pieces of lobster, topped with a delectable sauce, along with their shoestring fries. 

Our bet on throwing caution to the wind paid off in spades. This was one of our most delicious and most unique meals in Old Town Scottsdale. 

Service was friendly, competent, and efficient. The atmosphere was inviting with a unique building design, pleasant but lively recorded music, and a calming outdoor patio that's great for people watching. 

So we say, go to The Montauk and throw caution to the wind! Next for us will be a lunch, happy hour, and dinner in the near future--on different days of course. :-) The Montauk is a winner."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, The Montauk has the most amazing vibes and even more amazing drinks but the service is where it falls flat. I've been about 5 times in the last 2 months, trying happy hour, dinner, brunch, and casual drinks hoping that the last time was just a fluke and the service will be better but I have yet to be even slightly impressed with the service. 

Today was my breaking point.
I went in for my birthday brunch and after being told it would be a 45 minute wait (although the no wait app claimed 15 minute wait) I was sat 10 minutes after putting my name in; COOL THINGS SHOULD BE GOOD RIGHT THAT WAS A QUICK WAIT?

WRONG. 

My party sat, and waited 15 minutes before being greeted by a server and brought water (pretty typical wait to be greeted for them.) The server offered no introduction \"what can I get you to drink\" was the first words to come out of his mouth. We put in our drink orders and I set my timer to see how long it would take for them to out. 35 minutes later, still no drinks. We talked with 2 other tables who were clearly just as annoyed with the service. We watched the server carry a small tray of drinks and sit it on 2 different tables (something anyone who's ever worked in the industry knows is common sense not to do.) and thats when I made the executive decision to go elsewhere, because it would have easily been another hour before I would have gotten food.

If this was the only time its happened I would be understanding but when 4 of my friends have been on separate occasions and had the same issues (wait times/food wrong/people getting their food 5 minutes after everyone else with no explaination where their food is) thats when you know somethings wrong.

WHAT TO COME HERE FOR:
Happy hour/drinks
but sit at the bar, because at least then you can get a drink in a timely manner. 

I REALLY want to like this place but I won't be coming again unless I plan 3 hours for a meal."}
{"text":"This spot is the cutest little gem love the east coast vibes! Our server, Morgan, was awesome! I'm a typical girl, horrible with decisions, and he steered me towards the turkey and egg sandwich for brunch and it was   !!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food - had chicken with cauliflower rice , egg and bacon - super good!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my bf and I went to The Montauk, during happy hour. It was my first time in.  

The HH menu is spectacular. Really low prices for huge portions of delicious foods. They have some of the best clam chowder, in Arizona! The restaurant style is very East Coast, laid-back & beachy. They have indoor & outdoor seating. Overall a really nice restaurant. I will be back during happy hour with my friends.

Sadly the service we had last night, was terrible. Our server was not attentive and very slow to get back with us. By the time I received my entree, my boyfriend had already finished his meal. Fortunately the food and ambiance kept us slightly distracted, from the poor service."}
{"text":"The bartenders here don't even notice you. Myself and a girlfriend sat down and never got a drink or menu for several minutes so we walked out. Decor is nice...atmosphere not inviting. If the bartenders change is revisit"}
{"text":"This was a welcome accidental find. The honey jalapeño chicken sandwich is to die for. Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Came here one Saturday for brunch, ordered Clam Chowder, salty as hell, drank so much water and still have salty taste after paying the check, will not order that item again.  Ordered House Burger, just typical burger, just fancier on a nicer looking plate.  It's a great place to people watch and to hang out with friends, and that's about it."}
{"text":"Look... This is a solid place to grab a drink but if you want the cool kid advice the macaroni and cheese side is the order to make here. Get it."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 6 for brunch. The issues stared when they told us it would be an hour wait, despite numerous open tables being visible. Once we sat down, we ordered drinks that took 35 minutes to get to us. The service was the worst I have ever experienced, and we wasted 2 hours sitting there. The food quality was good, but did not make up for the awful service."}
{"text":"I came here with one of my old high school friends for lunch. The decor is absolutely cute. Nice and clean. The service was excellent, everyone was really nice. Although I wish they had better customer control the group next to our table we're drunk off their asses and were super loud. We couldn't hear each other talking during our conversations because the group was so loud and drunk. Mind you it was only 3pm for them to be that drunk. 

Anyways, I ordered the cold lobster roll and I really enjoyed it. My friend enjoyed his food too, but he was disappointed that there weren't any non-alcoholic drinks. Other than that the food and service was speedy."}
{"text":"Last night my girlfriend and I sat at the bar for drinks and dinner. there were about 10 people in the restaurant. We ordered a guacamole appetizer which came with too few chips. We asked for more. We also ordered a lobster roll and salad to share. After waiting a very long time we asked the bartender if it was coming shortly. He forgot to order it. He was busy training a pretty young bartender and was too occupied with this to take care of the 4 people at the bar. Perhaps they should train bartenders and wait staff when there are no customers present."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really dope and so are drinks. But the food isn't that great. When you ask a bartender/waitress about a drink they don't reply to you so you're not sure if they heard or not & a couple minutes later your drink is there."}
{"text":"Great location with great overall service. I came to this restaurant with fellow employees for happy hour and was definitely surprised by the great deals. I was able to go on a Thursday night, and NFL Thursday Night were on the tv's around the restaurant while the volume was perfectly set for watching or conversating while watching the games.
 
If you need a happy hour spot with great wine, and ambience definitely stop by here during a weekday or on a Saturday/Sunday morning. The indoor/outdoor option is perfect for the hot summer days or the beautiful fall nights. I'd recommend eating and relaxing here for any out of towner, or locals here in the valley looking for a nice relaxing place to catch up with family and friends while enjoying great food and drinks."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for the first time. We were seated and no one took the time to check in with us. We waited 30min. When I got up and spoke to the table next to us who had been waiting probably about 15min I told them we had been here awhile and no one had greeted us either.  I let them know I was going to speak with someone and ask for help. I walked up to the ladies at the hostest station and let them know. She said she would send someone over to both tables. About 5min later the waiter working in our area walked up to the2  ladies table first. They were kind enough to let the waiter know we were the ones waiting for now over 30min. The waiter began by saying that he's sorry we are not his table. Someone didn't show for a shift (I'm not impressed...you work for this company every table is your table and you have had plenty of time to high five and serve both tables of either your friends or people you thought were a better use of your time as you passed up numerous times.) We ordered drinks and received them in a decent amount of time. The ladies at the front even helped by bringing water. We now waited another 30 min for this waiter to ask \"did you want food?\" We did order an appetizer...I didn't care to order anything else at this point. The food wad good. However, again the waiter never checked in with us and about 20min later asked if we needed anything else. We said no. He then came over about 10/15 min later to let us know. That \" we have a reservation coming in and you don't need to leave, but they will be here in about 15min and need this table. If you want to move to the bar or whatever you don't have to leave but ya..\" I'm not surprised but...we also had to wait for him to drop off the check as well...I'm dissapointed in this experience. I hope this is not a normal visit here but I probably won't return to find out and I'd advise someone to look elsewhere...Scottsdale is full of other places to go to if not...I'd say sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I really like the concept, but the execution needs some serious improvement.

First of all, the décor and style of this place are amazing. You definitely get that New England feel. The place looks amazing and I love the way they've redone the space.

The food is pretty good as well, I had a burger and homemade chips, and they were great.

But then, the service, or lack thereof, makes it all fall apart. I sat at the bar, and the bartender paid enough attention to me to take my order and bring me a drink. Beyond that his situational awareness was completely lacking. He didn't notice when I needed a refill and I had to flag another guy down when I was done and needed my bill. In fact, I was sitting on the patio side of the bar, and while I sat there, a young lady came in and sat down on the restaurant side. Unfortunately, the two bartenders were so engrossed in conversation with some people who appeared to be with one of the liquor distributors, that they completely ignored this young lady. Eventually, after five minutes or so, she got frustrated, gave me a knowing look, and left. The barstaff is probably still oblivious that they lost a customer. 

Additionally, I noticed people at tables walking up to the bar and grabbing their own napkins and other items which tells me that they weren't getting service either.

The sad part is that I saw quite a few staff members, but they all seemed to be grouped toward the back of the restaurant where they were talking with each other rather than circulating throughout the restaurant and interacting with customers. In the experience I've had with restaurants and other organizations the lack of customer service usually comes from management and is copied by staff, so perhaps some new management is in order if The Montauk wishes to succeed. Personally, I hope they can turn it around. It's a great concept and one I would certainly support if it was well executed."}
{"text":"Came here for mimosas and brunch with a friend and left totally happy!

They had a deal running for $40 for a bottle of champagne and you can pick three different juices to mix with. We got guava, pineapple and grapefruit. All fresh squeezed and delicious! It was a great deal too because each mimosa costs $8 and we both drank about 4 and 1/2 by doing the bottle deal. So since we split it, it was $20 each instead of $24+

The food was also fantastic! I order the sweet corn scramble that had corn, kale and peppers and my friend got the breakfast sandwich that came with avocado. The side of fruit was delish and you could tell it was fresh and not from a can. And the home fries were crunchy and perfect! There were tons of good things on the menu, it was so hard to choose! Next time I'd like to try the Crepes. 

And there will definitely be a next time! I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice Sunday funday! The restaurant is tastefully decorated with the nautical theme and they had a live Dj there for brunch. The staff was all very pleasant and parking was easy to find. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday. Friends ordered a decent amount of drinks and said the sandwiches were good! I got the mac and cheese and substituted the hotdog crumble for chicken. It was a good sized portion. It took me awhile to finish it but totally worth it! Would recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The patio was full (a handful of tables) but otherwise the place was dead. We sat at the bar, because that's what we do, and we had to wait 15 minutes before someone ever brought us a menu. Once we finally got the menu and knew what we wanted it took another 10-15 minutes or so before anyone ever came around to take our order. We ordered a few over-priced cocktails. I was happy with mine (the Rosé Sangria) but my husband was very disappointed with the presentation and taste of his. It was definitely not worth the 10 bucks... next we tried an appetizer... $13 later... the ahi tuna tartare guacamole wasn't so much \"guacamole\" as it was just plain mashed avocado. Which, so what? I like avocado! It was ok, the wonton chips were good. And they did serve a generous portion of the tuna tartare. Then we ordered our meal. (Again after waiting an overwhelming amount of time to be paid attention to..) he ordered the \"famous\" lobster roll and I ordered fish tacos and upgraded my side to the crispy Brussels sprouts (def. the best thing we ordered) the \"shoestring\" fries were closer to day-old McDonald's fries than actual shoestring fries. They were stale and cold. (Womp-womp) the Lobster roll was tiny for the $20 we spent on it. And the fish tacos were bland. The fish itself was good, but the slaw that topped it was undressed and flavorless. I had to douse it with lime to make it less dry. 
All in all, we spent almost $100 on LUNCH and didn't even have stellar service to make up for the less than decent dishes. We were really disappointed because we'd had high expectations. Unfortunately, we won't be going back... I'm so sad to say."}
{"text":"Great place! Had the chicken jalapeño - was super delicious! The staff were very friendly and prompt. Definitely will come here again next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was great! We sat outside and they have misters. They don't rush you in and out and allow you to sit and visit and enjoy your meal and time with the people you came with. They had a fantastic live band. The service was excellent. The food was amazing! I got the kale salad and absolutely loved every bite of it! My daughter got the classic breakfast and she too loved her meal. Another in our group ordered the breakfast burrito. It was a breakfast burrito on steroids.  So huge and delicious. My other friend ordered the lobster roll. She said it was good. However, it was super small and for the price ($18 by itself) wouldn't order it again. Another friend in our group ordered the parfait. It looked awesome and it was good. Truly enjoyed our brunch and will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! Outstanding food, great service, very cosy atmosphere, great drinks, live music, DJ set in the evening... Clam chowder and lobster roll - to die for!! If you are at Scottsdale, stop by this place, we had a fantastic brunch polished with champagne ;-))) yaaaamm"}
{"text":"Great place to go in old town! Food was great and so was the atmosphere. Morgan was the one that was helping us out and he was wonderful! Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos and cucumber ranch 
Amazing!! 
Definitely a \"Hamptons\" feel with the people....but great food"}
{"text":"What a great place to go to for a nice relaxing time.  The place is open with plenty of seats.  Great food and drinks.  Service person was cheerful.  There was a lively vibe with a lot of people around having fun.  The music was stimulating too.  I'll go back for sure.  Oh, the outdoor patio was very nice."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us came to celebrate a friends birthday. We ordered just about every side on the menu. Awesome choice each side can feed about two people and still have room for the main course. 
To give a little background I am fortunate enough to travel fairly regularly and dine and some great restaurants. When I saw the Wagyu on the menu I got excited, until I actually got it which left me a little disappointed. It was similar to a New York strip but for double the price! There was no overwhelming beefy flavour or the delectable fattiness which is to be expected with a good cut of wagyu. 

As far as servers, it was great we had two waiters assisting and suggested some great bottles of wine for pair with our meals. Only issue we had which we did not realize until the next day is that we were double charged for one of the meals. 

They were also kind enough to bring us out a surprise birthday plate for the birthday boy.

All and all the price for the quality of food was not there in my opinion. But great view from where we were sitting on the patio to see the sunset was amazing. I would definitely come back when I am in the area, but maybe try one of the domestic choices of meat."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Chicago and are spoiled by our own access to great establishments for food and drinks.  We ended up at The Montauk twice during a 5 day vacation for good reason.  The porch has such a lovely atmosphere, servers are knowledgeable and engaging and the drinks are inspired.  We loved how it had a great selection of wine, beer and cocktails.  My husband could get his hoppy beer while I enjoyed a glass of good wine or a cocktails, it was perfect."}
{"text":"I love The Montauk and have frequented for about a year now and have finally decided to write a review about the place. After having Michael as my server multiple times I figured it's finally time to publicize my appreciation for him and the entire place in general. Every single time I am there he remembers me and takes the upmost care of me and my friends, service is always speedy on his part and he always provides us with great drink/food recommendations. I love seeing him there and will always request his section whenever I come in."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here with friends just about every weekend. The staff is always so friendly and the food is amazing. When I come in for brunch on the weekends Mikey (the manager) is always there checking around to make sure we have everything we need. I've  never been out to a place where I'm so well taken care of."}
{"text":"The Montauk is an east coast style restaurant and bar with sea aide decor.  You feel like you are in the Hamptons but you're in the middle of the desert.  The food was absolutely amazing and for an upscale restaurant, the pricing was moderate. I really enjoyed my experience"}
{"text":"Service was horrid waited around ten minutes never brought even water .. the name would imply seafood ... there is barely any ..limited to lobster roll and some fish tacos ..."}
{"text":"This place is five star for the creation of great atmosphere and solid comfort. The service was top notch and everybody is attentive yet very casual. The decor gives the full Nantucket vibe."}
{"text":"Honestly pretty average good at pretty high prices... all the menu items had great potential but the flavors just fell short. I will say, though, that their cocktails were refreshing and well made. I also like the upscale yet almost Beachy? Atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is my first time reviewing this place but I've literally been here too many times to be proud of  

The food has always been great! My favorites are the burrata, fish tacos, lobster roll and kale salad.

It's more of a loungey place with great music so if you're looking for a quiet dinner this might not be the best idea. But if you're looking for a good glass of rosé with a side of people watching then you've got your place!

My only complaint would be that the upstair lounge tables are a bit low if you're eating a full dinner but there's plenty of booths for that."}
{"text":"Welcoming! Feels like you're in the Hamptons! Great qualify food, great service. Small menu but creative!"}
{"text":"What a fun brunch place. When we got here they told us there was a 20 minute wait but we could get a drink at the bar. Luckily there were 3 seats at the bar so we just sat there!

The bloodys were great, nice and spicy! 

I got the chicken egg white crepe and it was huge, I was stuffed after I ate it. 

The DJ was playing great music, it was a little loud for my taste though."}
{"text":"Ever go to a pace that the staff is really friendly and tries real hard but overall the service was slightly below average and the food just there?

Well this is sorta one of those places.  

For an appetizer ordered the tuna tartar guacamole.  Decent portion of tuna, guac was relatively fresh but the pita chips served didn't really do much for it.  Did taste the Serrano peppers but just didn't have the flow.  Tried the house made chips.  Where a bit hard for me and one thing I love is homemade fries.

Lastly had  the fish tacos and while there was a generous portion, the taste wasn't really there.  Not bad, not that good.

Waitstaff was friendly and the atmosphere seemed cool.  Will probably be back to try some different menu items and see how they do."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back. This place is sophisticated and has amazing small plates. The tuna appetizer is amazing. 

Only complaint is the bartending. Order something simple or one of their specials and you'll be fine. Friend had the worst old fashioned."}
{"text":"The positive reviews are warranted.  Drinks were absolutely delicious and the lobster roll was outstanding.  Service was excellent and it was a lovely meal.  

I found the decor... confusing.  It's part Jack-Johnson-beach-shack, part garage-sale-vintage and part your parent's basement.  While I appreciate that it's not the sleek Scottsdale norm of brushed steel and granite, I'm not sure it fits together terribly well.  What's even stranger is that the bathrooms look like they were plucked out of a Scottsdale-brushed-steel-granite restaurant.  The stalls are roomy and there's more than enough room for a set or two of jumping jacks."}
{"text":"Great food but the service was slow.   Not sure if it was the server or kitchen but my bet is server.   The Poke salad was full of fresh ingredients and delicious.   Go easy on the dressing because of the soy base it is very salty.   Also a must order is the fried Brussels sprouts appetizer.   Everyone at the table loved them.   Don't hesitate to get two orders."}
{"text":"With a name like The Montauk I expect to be chilling out on an Atlantic ocean-front boardwalk with a lobster roll or some similarly-styled east coast fare. And frankly, that's kind of the feeling you get when dining here, despite the fact that you're in downtown Scottsdale. The open-air feel, cool color palate, and fast-casual attitude prop this all up. 

We stopped in for lunch in a large group, and I got to sample the cauliflower fried rice with lobster for my meal. It's a tasty, creative take on fried rice, with that classic American-Chinese fried rice flavor. And low carb! Woot! The lobster was an add-on, and they definitely were not shy with the meat. The lobster roll looks tasty as well. 

Service was on point, and while the food did take quite a while to come out, I'm imagining that it was my group of 7's large order that made it so. Otherwise it was a solid experience and I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"This review is based off of a takeout order our boss brought back to us. He was there for a lunch with a friend and had placed our order for the cauliflower rice. My coworker and I both ordered it with chicken and instead of an over easy egg, we went with scrambled. 

Our boss said he paid for tab and waited a bit since it didn't show up. He never saw his server again and had to ask someone else about the takeout order. Honestly, he thinks they either forgot about it after it was made or it wasn't made until he asked. 

When he got back to the office, I would say it was barely warm but I still enjoyed it as is. While I haven't been to this place in person, I'd like to try it out and be able to give them more stars. My meal was just okay - nothing special. I make cauliflower fried rice once in a while so I was not wow-ed by this. Bacon was crisp so that was a plus. The takeout container they used made the portion seem really small when you open it, but it is a decent amount. 

It just sounded like a mediocre place after listening to our boss about his lunch."}
{"text":"Took my buddy here for his birthday lunch.  Solid food.  The service was not perfect, but more hit than miss.  Really liked the roast beef sandwiches with au juis.  The housemade chips were great!  But the pickles...oh the pickles!  I'd come back just for the pickles (& maybe a side of chips).  The patio is great, though sit on the side-street side, not Scottsdale road (too busy)."}
{"text":"We love the look of this restaurant . We have came for lunch twice . The service is very friendly and welcoming .

We enjoy the food and drinks too!"}
{"text":"Very cute, beachy front porch atmosphere. Great drink selection and live music. Perfect Saturday afternoon spot."}
{"text":"Went for my bday last week. Early in the evening. Service was really slow. Painfully slow. They were however really friendly....
Appetizers were good. Drinks were good. You call yourself the Montauk? The Lobster rolls were a joke, you really need to revisit this menu item. Tiny fishy pieces of lobster, nothing like you would see back east. Not even close. Really disappointed in that. Unlikely I would go back or recommend. More clubby than restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the best cocktails in Arizona. We sat in the cocktail lounge before we went out (9-10pm) and my girlfriend was loving the decor and vibe. Service was prompt and we enjoyed the \"trade secret\" and the \"cherry whiskey smash.\" I was reluctant to leave but we did and we wished we would've stayed. Next time!"}
{"text":"I love The Montauk! I try to find every excuse to come here, it is one of my favorite outdoor patio bars.  

Drinks are great, but slightly overpriced. The people who come here are just always in a great mood. Their brunch avocado toast is one of my favorite meals, especially if its just starting a day-drinking event or curing a hangover from the night before.

Still - it is Scottsdale. Service can be slow with douchey self-righteous bartenders.  Luckily there are also some real serious rock-star staff members who care about good service, and it shows. I don't know her name, but there is one particular bartender who knows how to hustle for patrons.  She is darker skinned with a few small tattoos, but that's all I remember. I'll try to get her name next time.

Wednesday is half bottles of wine-- some of them are great deals. 

Definitely make this a stop as the temperature starts to amp up. It is a great Sunday Funday spot for the 30-40 yr old crowd, and one of my favorite places to catch up with friends and admire good looking company.  Just be prepared for a few kinks in service and to pay a few bucks more for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"They are rude and miscommunicate.
I asked the waiter before I walked in if dogs were allowed and he said no.
I asked if I could tie my dog to the outside railing and sit outside, would that be possible?
He asked the owner or manager or his boss and she gave a thumbs up.
So I preceded to tie up my dog and sit outside while my dog climbed up.
So then they said very rudely no no dogs allowed and the owner just got here so you guys gotta go.....
I'm like huh you just said it was okay if he was on the outside??????
WTF rude!!!
There were no other customers but one table inside."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites in Scottsdale. Yes, its busy, but it's high season the food a drinks are great, and we've never had trouble getting a table. Greyhounds, Deviled Eggs, and Lobster Rolls- all delish!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 9 minutes just to put in a drink order at the bar. And the place isn't even busy. Bartender took the order. Then took someone's order who came in after us and proceeded to make their drink. Walked out."}
{"text":"There is a hotel in Montauk, New York called The Surf Lodge, The Montauk restaurant in Scottsdale has attempted to recreate this mecca of lobster rolls, music and young Hamptons-cool-vibe. The main issue I have (despite the service, which I will get to in a moment) is that they have taken a very great idea and turned it into a boring Scottsdale restaurant.

I brought a group of friends here to pre-game and have dinner before going out for an evening, enthralled at the idea that someone could recreate the magic of the surf lodge. We were let down at every turn, from the blaring top 40 music to the nearly pitch-black lighting the whole ordeal was bewildering. 

It was a Saturday night but very few people seemed to be eating as I made numerous strolls through the place to check out the decor and vibe. Despite this, it still took about 45 minutes for our food to get to the table, terribly slow. 

I got to try a number of different items and was thoroughly unimpressed by all of them, particularly my cold lobster roll. I'm not sure what type of lobster they use here but they include a gigantic side-portion of butter, presumably so that you can eat the thing. 

I think that with some changes this could be a nice restaurant but the concept doesn't make sense to me, it is the restaurant equivalent of a bait and switch."}
{"text":"Great service great lobster roll.  Come here it's awesome!!!!   The only thing I didn't like was the cauliflower fried rice that was ordered was a little cold. Other than that the lobster roll was amazing. Lots of lobster top on my soft roll and kale salad that it came with was just amazing."}
{"text":"This is one place in old town Scottsdale I will dearly miss when I leave. Sunday mornings are absolutely amazing here form brunch. The champagne, the mimosas, the breakfast burritos.... I could go on and on about how awesome it is.

During the week, if you work in the area, it's also a great place for a quick, affordable, delicious lunch. Parking can be a little bit difficult in the area since it's old town, so if you can walk, I'd recommend that especially during busy hours.

Overall, it's got great decor, it makes you feel like you're in the Hamptons or something. Great place, great food, great staff. I'll miss you guys. I'll make sure to stop by when I visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner during a work trip. Everything was...ok. The servers were attentive enough but very over the top, and we felt a little rushed. The drinks were pretty good, I had the rose sangria and it was like a fancy Boones Farm. Overall, it was an ok experience, but probably wouldn't drop back in again."}
{"text":"I rather eat at Mcdonalds. My food was not fresh at all. Nice atmosphere, and it's at prime location in Old Town. I love the Mac N' Cheese, but it's a little too heavy. The best Mac N Cheese belongs to Wildflower and Modern Market."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Horrible service. I understand it was a busy day. But I didn't even get a spoon for my coffee, I had to ask for cream, then wait for sugar and s spoon 20 minutes later. I asked for over easy eggs they brought me scrambled eggs. Bad experience.... and I was so excited to eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"I came into the Montauk for the first time this past Friday and was very pleased! We sat on the patio which has a fun and cozy atmosphere. Our server Chris was phenomenal! I wasn't sure which drink to order, so he recommended the Endless Summer cocktail. It was delicious! For our appetizer he recommended the crispy rock shrimp. This was amazing and it probably could've been my meal since it was so big! GR and Taylor were very nice to come check on us during our dining experience. Overall, I was very impressed! I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Seriously the best  brunch / jump off spot for a weekend in SDale. The food was great, make sure to get a Mimosa Bowl. The atmosphere on the patio is chill but by far and large the service takes the cake. Shout out to Michelle for back to back days of excellent service."}
{"text":"This was the most delightful place for my sister's bachelorette!!! Cutest decor, delicious drinks, fries and chips, it was awesome!!! We love you!! Thanks for treating us AND LIVE MUSIC WHAT!!! Even the restrooms are super nice. Girl crush on our server:) I enjoyed the coffee ice cubes!"}
{"text":"Great experience here.. Came in with a very large party and they took great care of us. Mariah our waitress was so organized and gave us all our own tabs. Food was great as well. Will be back"}
{"text":"Decor Long Island 80's beachy (wicker). Music was really loud, hard to converse. With that being said, we came for brunch and we were not disappointed. We had two servers due to training, so our trainee was very good at making sure our drinks stayed filled. Hubby had the steak and egg sandwich (he really liked and big enough to share) and I had the lobster roll. I had to try it, it was tasty and $19. It was on a piece of potato bread folded to look like a roll and I got shoestring fries with it (so many I couldn't finish it all). None the less it was tasty. I am excited to go back and try their burrata or and their German chocolate creeps. I like the motif although not sure they were going for that 80's vibe (bar stools, marble bar, and wicker)."}
{"text":"Really hesitant about the 3 stars. I wasn't really amazed with this place. Very on the line with how I felt. I visited this place for dinner with a few friends.I had been told the place wasn't very good, but I wanted to see for myself while I was in town. 

Service overall was fine. Nothing negative to say, but nothing that wow'd me. Polite hostess, server greeted us fairly quickly, took our drink/food orders and you he's our table a fair amount of times. 

Deviled eggs with bacon jam, yum! These were memorable. I also had a chicken cesear salad which was a very generous size. 

They had a DJ playing that night and all I can say was great music, not so great sound system. Kind of sounded like one of the speakers was blown. 

Not sure if I'll be back but who knows, maybe it was just an off visit."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to get brunch somewhere new after church this morning. I always pass by The Montauk when I'm in old town and think it looks like a great atmosphere. We sat on the patio, weather was amazing. It took forever to get our food which is unfortunate, but the food was good; bacon exceptional. However, nothing worth waiting that long for. Average experience! The atmosphere is what makes the place."}
{"text":"Delicious prime rib breakfast sandwich! I highly recommend it. Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, The Montauk Happy Hour was absolutely incredible!!!!!! I'm already planning my next HH/Dinner here... {and have sent foodie pics to my fam & friends!} 

First, I have to give MAJOR props to our waiter, Morgan. He was super attentive and made our girls' night one of the best yet! {He even brought us special pink \"mystery\" drinks!} 

Happy Hour is Monday - Friday from 3 PM - 6 PM 

THE FOOD, oh my, HUGE portions and literally some of the the best food that I have had in a while. I highly recommend the house potato chips (MASSIVE BOWL for $3), Tuna Tartare Guacamole w/wonton chips (This was my favorite!!), Burrata w/fig, pistachio, prosciutto, arugula, truffle oil & grilled bread ...and last but certainly NOT least, the Mac 'N' Cheese add truffle oil. {Yes, i'm a truffle addict!}

For Drinks, they have $5 glasses of house wine, $17 bottles of house wine, $3 Beer & $5 well cocktails. 

Seriously dine here, you will leave just as happy as I did!! :) Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Came here at 345 to grab a couple drinks and an appetizer at the bar. Bartender looked our way 3 times, but never said she would be right with us or anything. She proceeded to cash out 2 checks near us. The guys next to us flagged her down for another drink and still no look our way. After 5 minutes we went to the hostess and asked for a table. We were sat outside and my wife's chair was broken. Decided to take our business next door to Diego Pops."}
{"text":"Might be the worst idea ever if you want brunch. Expect it to take 45 minutes to get a bottle of champagne when it's half empty, get raw eggs, pay 9 dollars for a slice of bread and have the manager come by to address our concerns to only walk away without commenting on anything except saying I'll be right back.... and never returned. Glad to know service exists. Thx Christina(server)and Morgan (manager). It was nice to watch you run your mouth from the corner immediately after stopping at our table. Christina was training another new server, and with a two person team they still could not manage to stop by and check on our empty drinks and untouched food. Awful."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch! Fun place great porch outdoors. 
Our waiter Morgan was terrific! He made our experience even better! You will love it if you give it a try!"}
{"text":"I went to The Montauk with a friend for lunch for the first time. When walking in you get a nice clean open vibe with today's top hits music playing at a comfortable volume. We chose to sit at a booth and we're greeting by a very friendly waitress with casual \"Sunday brunch\" attire. I had never been before so I decided to go with the fish tacos and my friend went with the macaroni and cheese with hot dogs. First off I instantly loved the place because they had mac and cheese with hot dogs on the menu. It was nostalgic and was actually pretty good. The fish tacos were excellent and my recommendation would be to come hungry if you order these. They were 3 huge tacos that came with a nice amount of fries. The tacos were delicious and tasted very fresh and they even had a nice cucumber ranch that I requested with the fries that was a different take on regular ranch which was great. I would definitely go back to this place as there were many other menu options that grabbed my attention."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for the younger crowd.  Music, lovely people and here is the surprise a really great play on the Ruben sandwich.  Cartelized onions and chicken.  You must go there and try one."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times! It's always been really loud, which I'm usually a fan of and Very busy! the Moscow mules here are yummie, the food is good too- I just was not pleased with my vegan options, but the service here is very slow. I understand because it's usually slammed, but I feel like there should be a better system in order. Also, bartenders will ignore new guests as well as walk right past them - especially during shift change. I still come back because my friend Is part of the HOH and I like the vibe! Hope to see improvement in service here in the future!"}
{"text":"Location, atmosphere and vibe!  This place has that quality that is hard to put your finger on.  The energy is awesome.  The team is always smiling.  Hard to go here and not have fun.  I am NOT under the age of 30.  I felt the mix of patrons was perfect.  Great place to take your team, family or spouse...  No wait for us...  Service was 5 star...  Steve"}
{"text":"We Tried The Montauk for the first time tonight and loved it!! The food was amazing and so were the drinks. I was unsure of what to get and our waiter Morgan made amazing suggestions! I loved the shrimp bowl and the trade secret drink that he recommended. I would absolutely go here again!"}
{"text":"What's a good place to have Saturday drinks with friends? Probably anywhere in oldtown to be honest, but I ended up at The Montauk... And so glad I did! The ambiance is really nice and laid back, gave me the beachy chillax feel (even though Arizona doesn't have a beach...grrr).

The service was meh... it was a beautiful day out and everyone was out enjoying the weather, so it was crazy busy, but still. The first round of drinks came up pretty quick, but then when ordered another round, they never came up... When I asked the bartender, she admitted that she forgot to make them. (No ding in stars, though, just because their watermelon mule was awesome -- I HIGHLY recommend it -- and I was pretty happy by the time I needed to order a second round.) My friend had some cantelope drink, which was not that great... stick to the mule, people!

The food menu looked really good, although I had just eaten so I didn't order anything but drinks. I want to come back for the food at some point, and try that out as well. 

As a bonus, while I was sitting there talking with my friends, I kept feeling someone was staring at me... Turns out, it was -- ready for the shoutout?! -- Kristen B.!!! A fellow yelper I met at an the amazing Sol Yelp Event I had gone to a few weeks ago! How awesome is that?! So while the excruciating wait for our second round of drinks to come up, we got to mingle with some amazing yelpers!"}
{"text":"Great prime rib sandwich for me & grilled chicken sandwich for my mate. Lunch was delicious, and the only criticism is that the music was so loud that conversation had to be almost shouted."}
{"text":"We came here for cocktails and appetizers on a Friday night. The music (90s hip hop) was awesome but quite loud if you're just looking for a meal. 

We shared every appetizer on the menu and really liked the potato chips topped with cheese."}
{"text":"Came to this little spot in Scottsdale for restaurant week. I had the burrata, scallops, and chocolate cake. My husband had the burrata, filet, and apple strudel. Everything tasted great! All of the ingredients were good so that was a big win right there. The scallops are quite small but were cooked very well.

The only bad thing is that it was quite loud and we happened to get sat at the coldest booth in the house apparently. It was freezing in the corner! I'm glad I brought my jacket! 

The wait staff was very good. Pleasant but not too much and not too stand offish.  

I liked the nautical decor, food, and quality. I'd return to try the fish tacos and burgers but probably on a day time visit. The prices didn't seem unreasonable for the area and quality (we saw the actual menu but didn't order from it).

We shall return!"}
{"text":"Gotta love their cocktails ! Always refreshing! And their late night menu it's a plus !!!! It's always so hard to find a place have late night menu in old town area besides fat food .. and I'm def not a fast food person ! My husband and I always come here for date night too!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience today. The atmosphere at the Montauk is so fun and great for a large group. We had over 20 people in our group and our server Mariah made it so easy for everyone. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Cute and very  \"old town\" drinks in the patio were good but very loud music. Very young vibe"}
{"text":"I've never been to Montauk but if this is what it's like, I'm all in! Came here for a quick work lunch and fell in love with their lobster roll! It's priced at $18 so I'm glad that there was a nice kale side salad that came with it. Sometimes lobster rolls can be overloaded with weird mayonnaise sauces or butter, but this one was perfect! The roll was soft yet slightly crisp on the inside from being heated on the stove top and the lobster had the perfect flavor and texture. I was really happy with my choice and honestly could eat this every single day! The restaurant was not busy during lunch and service was on point. Our waiter was really great at checking up on us throughout our meal and even when there was a mix-up with one of our orders, he handled it like a champ! Looking forward to coming back here on my next visit to Scottsdale.

{"text":"I had some time to kill so I stopped on because I saw them in the DreamTrips app. Before ordering I made sure my server knew how to make sure I could earn points. Whew. 
I had a yummy coffee drink (forgot the name. Oops) and a mimosa type cocktail with orange vodka, ginger ale and a splash of sparkling wine. It was really chilly with the cross breeze from the open windows so my bartender, gosh I'm really bad at this because I left the receipt and forgot her name (this was 30 minutes ago so she's here now). I had the warm lobster roll which was quite yummy with the house salad. I feel like it had too much sauce and didn't need the butter or lemon because of that. The roll was kind of small and the lettuce leaf, huge, so I ate it with a fork and knife. Overall it was really good. It just didn't need so much stuff for me to enjoy the lobster. Service was great. She was really helpful to another guy visiting from out of town which is how I found about my second drink. It's not on the menu anymore. I would recommend and go back."}
{"text":"A nice place for a glass of wine and generous and tasty appetizers during happy hour.  We would come back."}
{"text":"Weird female bar tender... she couldn't talk to me properly... I asked her a question and in the middle of a vague answer she turned away and walked away lol...

Conundrum drink tasted like a cheap $9 bottle champagne... or perhaps it was an aftertaste of  bartenders conduct... she kept on calling another worker babe... maybe he's the manager or owner so she can do whatever she wants there :)

Didn't see any good girls in the bar... it was almost a sausage party... so I left. Off tangent -
I noticed women in Arizona act as if they're  pretty... but they look hideous compared to my girls in Los Angeles... we need to import women from elsewhere to fill the state :) the locals are boring :) Or I HOPE i just haven't stumbled upon one yet..."}
{"text":"The place should get 5 stars just for the ambiance and decor because it's so fun and cute. Our waitress was a sweetheart buuut was no where to be found once we got our food. The food was mediocre and very disappointing. And they don't have waffles on their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm a pretty picky eater and still think the food is amazing! You can get anything from lobster roll t shoe string fries. The service and atmosphere are impeccable as well! Our waiter, Morgan, provided great service. He was easy to talk to and even brought out a complimentary shot at the end of brunch! I would 100% recommend Montauk for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Lobster rolls were on point..so are the fish tacos. But the must have is the kale salad! So tasty!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this restaurant. This last visit our sandwiches were not done right and being the type of people we are, we did not complain. Our server was attentive enough, though, that she went to the chef and corrected the order without us knowing, then paid for our meal. The service (and normally food) is worth the visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service horrid...waiting 25 minutes before a server comes by and then another 15-20 before my drink arrived. Place was not busy so there were no excuses."}
{"text":"I was actually going to eat at another restaurant in Scottsdale last night until, upon getting out of my car, I saw The Montauk. Well, as I've been to the real MTK a couple of times, I had to check this place out. I was not disappointed as the staff, food, ambiance, and decor were spot on and exactly what I needed. For the appetizer, I had the Ahi Tartare Guacamole, which was excellent. For the main course, I had the warm lobster roll and kale salad. Both were delicious and hit the spot after a long day of driving. Both presentations were attractive and the food was prepared with attention to detail.  I also had to get the cold lobster roll to go. So, gang, keep up the great work. You do it right!"}
{"text":"As much as I want to give this place 5 stars I can't. The service is incredibly slow. However if I was just to give a rating on the decor, layout, atmosphere, and food? Undoubtedly 5 stars. Hopefully their management sees the flaw and hires more staff."}
{"text":"Burrata was fantastic!!! Lovely way to spend an afternoon upon arriving in Scottsdale. Great location near the old town. Friendly staff and wonderful surfy-beachy atmosphere. Sat outside on the veranda and enjoyed a nice glass of wine and a Tito Vodka watermelon drink."}
{"text":"In love with this place. I'm visiting from Denver, and I'm so glad my friends took me here! Morgan was the best server and made sure everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"Moriah!! You are great and single handedly my made our brunch experience a phenomenal one! Thanks for being authentic!"}
{"text":"A really nice atmosphere and good breakfast food. Good value too! 

I can't vouch for the regular menu yet but breakfast and service were good. We were faced with a 45 minute wait at The Breakfast Club and I didn't feel like standing around outside there. So Montauk was a good alternative.

There were small families there as well as couples which gave the place a good vibe. It reminded me of someplace on Fire Island...kind of breezy and airy. No ocean of course but the decor gives it a light atmosphere. 

I'll definitely go back and try more."}
{"text":"I went when it had just opened and really loved the vibe and the food was unique and delish I will be back"}
{"text":"Apparently this food is great if you have been in prison for the past 10 years! Service was friendly but the food was pathetic to say the least. This truly isn't a restaurant but a bar without even good bar food is the sad part. Not sure the person who dreamed up the lobster roll has ever actually seen a lobster roll but Montauk's is anything but a lobster roll. Twenty bucks for some horrible lobster salad smeared on a roll and some oily house chips!"}
{"text":"This must be one of the worst managed places I've ever been. I liked the atmosphere and location.

However, the operation was woefully under-staffed. There were empty tables but yet they weren't seating anyone. Time to get drinks and food was painfully long. After two rounds of drinks and a few appetizers, we went elsewhere for dinner.

This place will never survive if they don't learn how to manage the work better."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! I've got to mention the staff. Caitlin made an out of towner feel like I was at my local spot and I had a hard time leaving after getting served by her.  Guided me through the menu and helped me taste some great new spirits! This'll be my spot every time I come back!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Was seated quickly but that's all that was good. Ordered simple order or two avocado toasts, scrambled eyes, potatoes and bacon. No silverware, server never came to check on us other than to say food was coming, 50 minutes after we order food came. It was cold, hard, burnt and appeared to have been forgotten or just had remains placed on plate. 
Other tables were seated same time as us and after and all received their orders before us (and they had 4 plus ppl person table) 
Had to ask for manager who said he would take care of it. Here's hoping he does. 
Would not recommend nor come back here, better to wait next door at breakfast club and get your meal while it's still warm."}
{"text":"For a place as aesthetically pleasing as this one, it falls very short. Sat at the bar, ordered a pellegrino and fish tacos.  A disinterested bartender, mediocre to poor food, dirty condiment bottles, $8 for a 16.9 oz sparkling water, and the cultural appropriation of having Biggie playing reminds me why I never venture to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this one 2 stars. One because I appreciate the fact that it's opening week and they are working out the kinks and the second because the manager came over to take responsibility for my meal not being to acceptable standards and took it off the bill.

I had the fish tacos per the recommendation of our server who said they were the best thing on the menu. The piece of fish (pictured) was no bigger than 2 small French fries so it was mainly cabbage and a soft corn tortilla. The manager said she spoke to the chef so I'm hopeful that they will make the necessary adjustments. The irony is that I understand this place is owned by Diego Pops next door which has great tacos so not sure what happened here.

Two of my friends ordered the French Dip which were both delivered minus the actual \"dip.\" The buns were also served without the creamy horseradish dressing. The server apologized and brought out both. The dip was good however the creamy horseradish tasted like spiced mayonnaise. Overall, just fair.

We may give this place another shot but not until they get their menu together. There are too many other great places nearby that have great food for the same price points.."}
{"text":"Warm Lobster Roll is amazing! Service is great and the location and atmosphere is perfect! Best place to people watch and sit outside during lunch!"}
{"text":"Walked in. Waited 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us. The table was dirty, the host (?) said the table would be wiped. The bus person did wipe the table. After that we waited 10 minutes. No One came over.  There was a lively bar scene, mixed age. We fit in the mixed age bracket but were for some reason ignored. NEVER do we take a walk, but we were hungry. We live here and this place was on my list to try. Not anymore. Went nearby where they have a greeter, seater and servers that serve the customer. Will never go back, ever."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I live around the corner and would be a regular here if it were good but sadly, that will not be the case. At least now I better understand why there was no one else in the restaurant. We started with the artichoke, which we had to send back because it was not cooked. The fish tacos were OK if you got a good piece of the fish but some bites were terribly fishy and tough. They came with french fries, which were lukewarm at best. They tasted like they may have been reheated. We ordered a side of sweet corn, which tasted like something in heavy butter, but certainly not sweetcorn. The side of steamed brussels sprouts was the best thing we ate. On the bright side, the service was excellent. You would hope so since no one else was in the restaurant but the young lady was very sweet and attentive. (Aliana.)  There are so many incredible an outstanding restaurants in old town Scottsdale and throughout the valley. I can't imagine why someone would spend their money and calories here."}
{"text":"I brought my team here for lunch during our meeting in Old Town Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is so tastefully done, the service is great, but the food is just ok.  The tuna was disappointing and not what everyone was expecting, but the cauliflower fried rice was pretty tasty, but just too big of a portion.  I will definitely stop back in for cocktails only and enjoy the beautiful decor!"}
{"text":"Went into Montauk this morning, Moriah was our server she was definitely on her A game, came in for brunch food got the breakfast sandwich that was recommended by our server. Overall great experience (:"}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Scottsdale. The bartenders were on point and very friendly.Tyler, Nate, and Morgan made our night. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing cocktails, and the food was ok. I had the chicken kebobs. The chicken was dry. The kale salad was very good and made me actually like eating raw kale. I would recommend this place for a fun night out. I'll go back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We came for a birthday and such good vibes. If you come with a group get the punch bowls!  I got the Mac and cheese and it was phenomenal. But truly the best part was our server Margo! She was so great, she gave us excellent recommendations and fun to talk with!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time.  My wife and I ordered Lobster roll and she got a side salad.  I ordered a side a bowl of clam chowder and the waitress asked if I wanted it first, which I responded yes.  Food was delivered and we had no silverware or napkin....it took at least 10min to flag someone down to get silverware and my soup wasn't delivered.  I didn't get my soup till after the meal.  Waitress apologized...it was an odd experience.  The food was really good but management should work with staff on customer service.  Not sure we will be back as the service really impacted the quality of food."}
{"text":"Honestly it's really neat inside so maybe it's cool at night but we came for breakfast and it was mediocre at best. Wouldn't recommend. Truly wasn't impressed...great greyhound though"}
{"text":"We had the starter homemade chips, fish tacos and burger with drinks. Most of the food was decent; our only complaint on food was the chips were covered in truffle oil, which I don't like (description on menu made it sound like plain chips and dip but in fact they had shredded cheese and herbs on top as well). No one checked on us so I picked around for the maybe 1/4 chips without and my husband tolerated eating the ones with and we moved on. As we ate the main meal it was pretty tasty although I did decide that if I were to ever order the fish tacos again I'd ask if I could get the fish without the deep fried batter. We got our bill, paid 15% as we felt the service was ok but not the most attentive we've had. Well, the kicker and reason for our two star review was the waitress complained about our tip. As we were walking out we overheard her tell her colleagues about it. Since we are in town on vacation I figured we'd eat there again, but after hearing the waitress complain with her staff we were so insulted we will not return."}
{"text":"We want to like this place, we're local. The patio is great, they have TV's for sports, it has a fun vibe.
However, nothing irks me more than paying money for bad food. The ribeye that I added to my house salad was such a poor quality of meat, not to mention the salad in a bag that was under it. Couldn't stomach it. Kitchen is painfully slow; staff is courteous, but not worth my American dollars.
So many better places in our neighborhood. I'm picky, but my spouse isn't, and he doesn't want to eat here again, either..."}
{"text":"Yummy food and nice atmosphere. 
This was our 2nd visit to the Montauk. The ahi guacamole is delicious as well as the deviled eggs. But the main reason we returned was for the Mac and cheese! Our first visit I ordered it with lobster, this time plain, both excellent. 
Perfect spot for my macaroni pregnancy cravings :) the only reason I give it 4 starts is because there are several unbelievable 5 star restaurants here I love and this doesn't seem to fall under the same rating, and the drinks all seemed to have more ice than beverage to us.
It is good food and good service, but in my opinion, not amazing food."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Scottsdale I make a point to visit Montauk. The atmosphere is relaxed. Today, Morgan took exceptional care of us ensuring my sister and I enjoyed our time. If you like grapefruit, I highly recommend the Trade Secret drink!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food.their lobster sandwich and mac and cheese is  awesome service was excellent. See myself coming back here"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. Got right in and sat down and was able to catch up with an old friend over a Bacon & Egg crepe with mango mimosa for brunch. Lovely atmosphere with live music."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try The Montauk for dinner last night, but unfortunately, we weren't that impressed. We had been here once before for brunch, and though the food wasn't memorable to me, I did like the atmosphere and look of the restaurant, and I wanted to try the dinner menu.

The service was good for the most part - we were seated right away and didn't have to wait long to put in our drink and food orders. The only problem was that we ordered an appetizer we really wanted to try, the Crispy Rock Shrimp, and never received it. When we got our meals before the appetizer, we assumed our waitress just hadn't heard us, but were later surprised to see it on our bill. Luckily she was really easygoing about it and took the charge off right away, but it was still kind of a bummer. 

For dinner, my boyfriend ordered the Fish and Chips, and I got the Turkey and Egg Sandwich. Neither of us really liked our food, and we're really not that picky, so it's not like this happens often lol. For him, the fish was really plain - just battered with no seasoning. I thought the sandwich was a little bland as well considering all of the toppings (tomato, havarti, avocado, and pesto aioli). To me, it was really just a mess, and I was surprised it was just on a plain hamburger bun, because that made it really soggy.

I will say that their french fries are delicious, I'd have been happy with just an order of those :) another redeeming quality for this place is their happy hour (M-F, 3-6p). Draft beers are only $3, and they offer all of their appetizers for half price!"}
{"text":"What a nice classy/casual place. Delicious eats and the drinks are very refreshing. The bartenders know how to please!! The atmosphere is great with great music to vibe to. Awesome service as well!!"}
{"text":"Decent. But Don't get the fruit as a side! It's just two mango slices and an orange, and they won't exchange it!"}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food, haven't had a chance to try it. I came in with my service animal and was told we wouldn't be allowed to sit inside and would have to wait for an outside table. Illegal under the ADA but I figured it was a nice day so why make a fuss. Then waited for an hour while the table we were told was for us outside was given away because the reservation had arrived. Still waited and when finally called for a table was addressed not by name, but by \"service dog.\"
Food could be the best in the world, but even if it was, being treated this horribly should discourage everybody from dining here."}
{"text":"Great remodel of building and menu.  New food is great or at least the breakfast food, I have not had lunch or dinner there yet.  Love the new more open floor plan and it is much lighter and inviting then the old place.  The breakfast menu is really good.  I have had the breakfast sandwich and classic breakfast.  Both were good and the presentation was well done also.  Everything that people ordered looked really good.   Patio is one of the best in old town for atmosphere and people watching.  See you again soon..."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I decided to go grab a bite, and haven't been to this location since it's transformation from Bungalow. We decided to try something new and were quickly seated on the lovely (though loud, due to traffic) patio just in front of the building. The waiter was friendly, though seemed very flustered and new (which is fine - I've waited tables before and get that it can take some acclimating...) He was quick through the first half of our meal, but was having some trouble with another table and slowed down through the second half. (We didn't mind much, as we were catching up.) When we started looking through the menu, I found myself a little surprised at how few entrees were offered. The current menu really lends itself better to happy-hour salads or sandwiches, rather than substantive dinner fare. I settled on the jalapeno and grapefruit salad, which included a variety of great textures, thanks to the pumpkin seeds, croutons and other toppings. I asked for chicken, and was a little less than thrilled to find that the chicken is served cold rather than hot, but at least it was flavored well. I'm sure I'll be back - though I hope next time to see a bit more of a dinner offering."}
{"text":"We tried the Montauk last night and were immediately drawn to the outdoor seating. The hostess was very nice and quickly checked for an open table and came back to seat us with a smile. We waited more than 5 minutes for a server to greet us and I might add that it didn't appear to be busy at this time. Once Ariana came by she was very nice. We ordered a couple drinks after asking her about some favorites. Drinks took quite a few minutes but while we waited a manager came by to light the candle on the table. At least I think it was a mgr. He didn't even acknowledge we were there. 
Once we got our drinks we ordered dinner. We decided to share the prime rib sandwich and the lobster wedge. Then we waited....and waited...about 25 minutes later food was delivered. At that time we ordered another round of drinks. The food was amazing. Prime rib was lean and tender and the creamy horseradish set it off. Lobster wedge, phenomenal. I will say from a food cost standpoint it didn't need so much of the blue cheese crumbles. I like a lot of cheese but there was plenty left on the plate after the salad was finished. We finished our dinner before the second round of drinks was delivered which was a really long time as we were visiting and taking our time. Ariana actually cleared our plates and apologized and said they'd be right out. Keep in mind we watched bartenders cleaning glassware this whole time and the perception we had was that making drinks for the service well just wasn't a priority. I really felt that the service timing wasn't Arianas fault. However, she should have involved her manager at this point. Letting a mgr know how long tickets are taking from the bar and kitchen is crucial. 
We loved the deep seating on the patio. Love the design and how open it is. Not totally sure what the mexican blankets have to do with the decor though. 
We also couldn't help but notice that the staff for the most part looked pretty sloppy. I get the more casual approach to uniforms these days but I personally think that if you want guests to appreciate your service you don't show up to work in wrinkled clothes with no effort given to your appearance. It's not just about taking the order and delivering the food.
This is a beautiful new restaurant and the food is fabulous but the managers need to be more present. Talk to your guests, get out on the floor and see what's going on before it's too late. We all know how fleeting customer loyalty can be in a town that's ever evolving and we'd like to see you stay in the neighborhood awhile. Keep at it and we will be back to try you again soon.

P.s. The astro turf could use a Hokey or small broom.  There was lots of food crumbs and debris near the tables."}
{"text":"I had the steak sandwich and clam chowder and both were absolutely amazing. The decor is just like an old beach house. Very cool atmosphere. Craig was my server and could not have been more attentive. Recomended"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot for casual drinks and light eats, not so great for dinner, the theme simply doesn't compliment it. I otherwise love their kale salad w/chicken, their cold lobster roll, cauliflower rice w/egg and their lemongrass ceviche! And make sure to start your drinks with a Sparkplug (for my coffee lovers out there)."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service & food. We gave this place a try when they first opened and were told they had no happy hour. We decided to stay anyway and the wait for our drinks took over 20 minutes. We decided to give this place another try so I organized a group of 6 people to join my husband and me for dinner. We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and when I went to a staff employee to ask for my drink, I saw them sitting there. I said, \"we've been waiting for our drinks for over 30 minutes, could we please have them.\" She responds, \"I JUST poured them.\" She then proceeded to talk to her friends and let another 5 minutes pass. When I asked for a manager, guess who they pointed me to? That's right folks, the girl I had originally spoken to with the rude attitude. When our food arrived, the french dip was AWFUL! It was 90% fat and gristle. It was absolutely the worst french dip we have ever had. When I let the owner in on the mess, he bought me a drink. Nice thought, but he should have done more. We will never go back there. I give this place a year."}
{"text":"Omg where do I begin.....

First off our waitress was no where to be found, we had to pour our own waters by grabbing the water jug from the bar. Their version of Crispy
Brussels sprouts were so bad almost like it was boiled in water. We had to send back every Brussels sprout order we got. After awhile the rolling the eyes waitress said \"well maybe we should just take them off the menu!\" We all said \"YES! we think you should.\"  

We asked for separate checks and guess what. One check that we all had to divide all by ourselves! 

The icing on the cake....everyone had got their dinner order but me and another. He got his 5 mins after everyone else but Me? Nope I had to wait 15-20mins while staring at everyone finishing their plates. by the time I received my dish I was the only
One eating and everyone had their plates
Cleared and taken away. 

I've never had such bad service before and it's astonishing because of this place being right in old town and I've heard so much. 

I will not be coming back here!

P.S. The manager was very kind to deduct our bill for the service and maybe was a bit overwhelmed for a second."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is usually really good, minus one time when my prime rib dip was a little too fatty. They were great about it though. I say order anything with lobster as they're never cheap with it. Drinks are good too!"}
{"text":"First review!! Came in on friends and family before the big opening! Had the Prime Rib and the house salad. Really tasty flavors in the prime rib. Great aftertaste. As far as salads go, it was great!! Fresh ingredients with a cucumber ranch dressing! Atmosphere is very inviting....white walls with a east coastal vibe. Really cool classic American vibe. Great location and patio right in the heart of old town!! A must see...."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere 
I went there with some friends , I would say very college atmosphere 
The food is not great at all and the service is very slow 
The prices are just way to high 
I would think that you can get a better selection of drinks and beers 
Not that much to offer 
Maybe bc of the location they don't care much about the food  quality, service and drinks 
If you are looking just to go and a OK food with OK service it's a good place"}
{"text":"The food was creative and tasty. The craft cocktails were awesome (and stiff!) which is nice because it's a little pricier than some of its neighbors for drinks. 
The atmosphere alone deserves 5 stars as its name precedes it...I felt like I was in Montauk, NY having brunch with friends. Love it. 
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars: the host was a tad rude about me bringing my dog (who was secured inside of a small carrier) into the restaurant because he stated \"the manager doesn't like dogs\"
Well alrighty then! I'll definitely go back at some point, but I'll make sure to leave Fido at home.

Ps- the rose sangria"}
{"text":"5 of my gf's & I were celebrating a reunion on patio this wknd for drinks. We stayed for several hours w a bill over &100. We only saw our waitress a couple time during our stay. (Despite business being slow)Several others passing by had to be waved down & instead of asking us if there was anything they could help us with we were told we would have her sent over, never happened. Will not be visiting  again & definitely not referring others to try it out."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day for breakfast and was not a fan.  My over med. eggs were dripping in oil and tasted like oil not an egg.  Nothing impressed me about Breakfast... I wouldn't go back for breakfast at least.  I like the atmosphere though.  Oh an the front of the building is by the street not the parking lot.  Don't make that mistake, they aren't so friendly about it."}
{"text":"Loved the building and decor. It was a Tuesday evening and no wait. Overall great service by all from beginning to end of our dining experience. It's a small (1 page) menu but seems to offer something for everyone. We started with garlic hummus serviced with smartly sliced carrots and cucumbers and charbroiled, toast. I think it was some sort of wheat bread. The veggies with the hummus was great. We also tried the devil eggs with truffle oil. Yum!! But you should have more than two people in your group if you are going to order the eggs. 
Main course for me was Brussel sprout tacos. So amazing! Flavor was great. I highly recommend them! Cauliflower rice with chicken (and an egg) was the other order which was described as \"okay\"."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for not being busy, the service was outrageously slow, we were seated immediately but it took forever to get drinks, then forever after that to order food. The shoestring fries were cold and the grilled chicken sandwich did not have avocado spread and I was told that wasn't part of it despite specifically seeing it on the menu. 
The prime rib sandwich that my boyfriend ordered was good but the Mac and cheese was just between cold-warm (which isn't appetizing for pasta foods). 
Unfortunately we had gone before with our family and food and service was good, but this was not a great experience food or service wise."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time for Saturday brunch. They had a one man band and the ambiance is relaxing as others have mentioned. They were busy, but nothing too crazy. The hostess seemed to be all over the place and took forever just to seat anyone, so we sat at the bar.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced,  but the service was sub par and the food took forever-we're talking 40 minutes for a breakfast burrito and crepes. When the food came out it was good, but they forgot one of the sides and utensils. 

The guy sitting next to me was waiting for a hamburger for over 30 minutes and had to leave without his food because it took so long. If I was on a time constraint, they'd be getting less stars. I will try it again, but they really need to improve their service or it won't make it very long."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the Mac & Cheese w/ lobster. Very tasty. I'd definitely like to come back for some day drinking and people-watching! Nice concept in the heart of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very cool place just for the ambiance alone.  Great to people watch and very cool with the complete mixed crowd.  Young and old...   all very fun.   Food and drinks are great.   DJ has cool spin choices and directs the vibe he wants depending on what is going on.  Always an easy drop in!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4's for atmosphere, service & drinks. The food didn't blow me away. We had lobster Benedict, avocado toast, and the prime rib egg sandwich. Overall a lovely spot in a great location"}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD FOOD AND DRINKS!   Friendly people.  
My favorite place in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came for a friends 21st birthday.  The staff was welcoming and exceeded our needs. I ordered the breakfast burrito, great amount of food for $7!  So yummy.  Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight, I have been wanting to try this place for a while but I was a bit disappointed.  The food was great.....service was so so.....portions were so so.  Waited a while for a table and it was not that busy, then waited almost 20 minutes to get water and order drinks.  When we finally ordered it took us forever to get our food.....I'm still waiting for my bill.  Not sure how I have stayed at a restaurant for almost an hour and a half just for dinner and they are not busy.  I would recommend the warm lobster roll.....great."}
{"text":"This place used to be bungalow, and they haven't remodeled much from what it used to be. NOT a good place for groups. We had a going away party and they put half our party inside, and half our party outside, with the outside party spread out on the patio all at different tables. Had we known it was going to be like that, we would have went somewhere else for dinner. This wasn't the going away dinner we were thinking of...

Food and drinks were good. Service could use some work, however we were a large party so I can't judge the service since it's always hard to serve larger parties, but I would recommend putting more than 1 server for a party of 25..."}
{"text":"Great food. Fun atmosphere. Attentive service by Morgan. The crispy shrimp app was amazing."}
{"text":"I went to Montauk for brunch on a Sunday day. It took over 2 hours not because we wanted it to, because our server sucked. I've been here a few times and the service is always slow, but today was off. It took 20 minutes for someone to bring us waters. A worker told me it was policy to not serve us until our whole party was here. Everyone's order was wrong. The server tried to make up by bringing us free shots, but then made it seem like a burden to separate all our or receipts for a party of 10. I wouldn't recommend if you are with a big group. Just go to the bar. One of the servers was crying in the bathroom and our server had to of been stoned out of his mind. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you have a lot of free time."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere , service and the food especially the lobster roll was great.
I'll go back."}
{"text":"The most fun brunch place I've been in Old Town! I got the Burrata and I have never had a more delicious brunch meal! I felt cooler just by being there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I rarely go out to eat as we enjoy the kitchen together but we decided to step out into the Scottsdale area and simply ran into this place.  We were so hungry and expressed that immediately after being seated.  It was around 4pm and there were only 7 other people in the entire place.  

We ordered the fish n chips and it was the greasiest I've ever experienced.  Not to mention it took almost 45 minutes to get the food (again, NO ONE around) and the fried food was cold? Wait, what? Yes, not to mention the fries and fish were cooked in the same grease that had to be at least a week old. Gross!  

I left most of the meal on the plate with no offer if something was wrong.  Our server (receipt says Gaddy Lauren) had to have been on something because it was the slowest service during a time when no one was there.  Did I mention the place was filthy? 

That was a HUGE $50 mistake. Save yourself and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Forget the breakfast club across the street, this place is legit! Shaved prime rib breakfast sandwich with egg, swiss & bacon is a home run!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch with the ladies on a Saturday morning. It was good we got there at 10 because by the time we left it was packed!
Tried a little of everything at our table: Lobster roll, Turkey and Egg sandwich and Berry Crepes.
I had the high dollar item, hot lobster roll with a kale salad. For $20 I was a little disappointed.  The roll was a standard soft hot dog bun, no toasting or buttering.  The lobster was plentiful but a little rubbery which means its over cooked, but very flavorful with the sauce. I ate it all!
the kale salad was heavy on vinegar so I could only eat about 1/2 of that.

The berry crepes looked huge and must have been delicious, the plate was empty.  The turkey & egg sandwich was another plentiful dish with a large side of potatoes & fruit.  I would go for these items before I'd go with the lobster roll next time."}
{"text":"I never write reviews on here, but after my horrible experience at The Montauk, I felt compelled to share.

We were initially drawn to this place due to its cute decor and fun atmosphere. But after dining here, we learned it doesn't have much more than that. 

We were initially quoted 30 minutes, but then were told by the hostess that they actually had a table getting ready for us. SIKE! They didn't so we ended up being quoted 30 minutes again. After ten minutes she got us sat. As we approached the table, it was sill being wiped down and wasn't set for us. Not a huge deal, I can usually overlook things like this. 

Our server was quite a joy. Can't tell if she was new, super busy, or just actually terrible. She approached us and said she'd be right back with waters and that we were her only table so she could take excellent care of us! When she was ready to take our orders, we asked very simple questions about the menu because we were visiting from out of town and wanted to know what the best/most popular items were. She didn't seem to know much of anything about the menu. For example, when we asked what type of bread comes on one of the sandwiches, she pointed to the table beside us and said \"I think it's that kind of bread.\"

I had high expectations for the food as other yelpers raved about it, and a few friends recommended the place. We ordered the turkey and egg sandwich, the sweet corn scramble, and the honey jalapeño chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, we were very let down to say the least. All four of us were disappointed with everything we got, and honestly I can't even even say anything positive about any of the food.

The cherry on top of this awful experience was when we were ready to settle up the bill. We asked the server to split the bill in half, which we didn't think was a crazy request. She said sure and walked away. She then brings back the bills and after we politely told her it was incorrect, she walked away without saying a word. After more than 10 minutes waiting for the revised bill, we noticed the manager helping her at the POS. We decided to go and ask them if everything was alright and if they needed any clarification for how we asked to split the bill. The manager looks at the server and asks \"What table are they at?\". After pointing to our table, the server says \"we're taking care of it\". So with no help or acknowledgement from the manager whatsoever, we sat back down. 

After about another 10 minutes of waiting, the server walks by and drops our checks on the table without saying a word, and walks away. Thanks! 

This was probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced in a restaurant and that says A LOT. Everything from the scattered host, to the terrible food, the rude server, and the unconcerned manager, was awful.

As an individual who works in the food service industry, I 100% try to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to dining experiences. I get it, things happen, but this was just too bad to ignore."}
{"text":"Second time coming here for brunch... another artists playing music (this time signing while playing  on the keyboard) and great atmosphere! Ordered a few drinks to start the day and then the delicious breakfast sandwich... again LOL. Always a ton of girls here, too if you're looking for better views! Must try!"}
{"text":"Love the Montauk!  Brunch, happy hour, or dinner is always delicious.  It has such a cool, nautical atmosphere -- reminds me of being on Cape Cod!  The bar and patio are super chill and their drinks (and wine list) are great.  A Scottsdale staple!"}
{"text":"Not a good day for service and food. We had to wait over an hour for our food. Took several try's but found out the kitchen was backed up and it was 3 pm on a Sunday. Poke bowl very disappointing- crunchy rice, absolutely no flavor other than the sesame oil to drizzle on the tuna and lettuce, complete lack of seasoning. Steak tacos equally as bad - no seasoning and tiny amount of beef. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday brunch. First time visitor. The restaurant was about half full and we were seated promptly. When we got to the table, the cloth bench was dirty (pieces of food), no big deal. I ordered a burrito with no bacon or avocado and a side of fruit. My husband ordered a burrito with no tomatoes and a side of potatoes...when the food arrived he got a burrito with no avocado and no tomatoes. I got a burrito with no tomatoes and bacon. I sent my order back, only to have the person bring back my plate and tell me they don't even put bacon in the burritos(mmm, ok-its listed on the menu and I can see it).
Our waitress didn't come back for a while so I removed the bacon from my dish and ate it. Also, she gave me potatoes instead of fruit as a side. When I asked for fruit I was charged for an extra side. 
From the street it looks cute. Food was average. Place could use a good cleaning. Service was complete and total garbage. I had a feeling the waitress would mess up the order when she didn't write anything down after we told her what we wanted.
Wouldn't return or recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good vibes, drinks are great, and food is fantastic! Definitely recommend the ahi guacamole."}
{"text":"One word. Disappointing. I follow the Montauk on Instagram and the sister restaurant The Yacht Club... I was really holding the bar high for this place, but they dropped it.  We came in Saturday around 2:00pm.  The DJ was good and that was about all.  It was incredibly hot inside, we asked someone to turn the AC down and couldn't feel a difference. If you are going to have a restaurant with large open windows and try to make the outside feel like the inside expect to pay the price by running the AC non stop at 70!  We would have been better off sitting outside.  The service was mehhhh, not good, not too bad.  The watermelon mule was okay, but honestly I make a better one at home.  I ordered a breakfast crepe off the \"brunch\" menu which had bacon, cheese, home potatos on the side and an egg on top of the crepe.  It was horrible; dry, dry, dry.... All together our bill with tip was $75.00.  I am not going back and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday morning with a friend at around 12:30 and sat at the bar. There were 2 bartenders behind the bar. We didn't get our drink orders taken for about 10 minutes and it took even longer to get in food. Safe to say the service was well below average especially seeing how slow the bar was. I ordered the Rosé sangria which I couldn't even finish because although it looked pretty it was not very good. Both my friend and I ordered the yogurt parfait which was pretty tasty!!! The Greek yogurt was a little bland but I loved the vanilla granola and fruit.
There was live music which I'm a fan of but it was obnoxiously loud. It was loud to the point where it sounded like the speakers were going to blow out.
Ambience was ok, food was great, service sucked"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great price point, friendly wait staff!! Some of the best hand crafted cocktails in town. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The scene is more promising then the flavor.  With all of the great seafood joints that have popped up in the last few years it's hard to see this place as a viable option.  The biggest disappointment was the Lobster Roll.  It was very fishy and paled in comparison to the offerings at Buck & Rider or the now departed Yacht Club."}
{"text":"Drinks are excellent. Unique and delicious. Food is best I've had. Fresh, unique, flavorful. The deviled eggs are wonderful. Husband had a turkey egg sandwich that was fresh. The thinly sliced turkey was best way to put on sandwich. Egg was over easy. I had the ahi salad. This was healthy, filling, fresh and delicious. Chopped ahi, mango, edamame, brown rice, lettuce, cashews, in a ponzu sauce ."}
{"text":"Montauk is the go-to brunch place in Scottsdale. They have live music and sometimes a DJ but it's a great beach house type feel. Feels a bit LA, Santa Monica but has pretty decent food and excellent drinks. I recommend they grey hound and burrata appetizer."}
{"text":"We went to the Montauk for brunch, right before catching our flight back to San Antonio. The place seemed popular and had a good vibe going. I ordered the lobster roll and my wife went for the smoked salmon crepe. Both of these offerings sounded really good; however they proved to be pretty disappointing. My lobster roll was just OK, which I guess is understandable since we are in Arizona and not in Maine. The real disappointing dish was my wife's crepe; it barely had any smoked salmon on it! Service was pretty poor, they had about 10 people serving but they seemed more interested in chatting with the customers or each other instead of serving the patrons. I'd also have to agree with Aaron S. on this place being overpriced for the quality of the food and service. I wouldn't say it was our worst experience, but it was sadly below mediocre!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there . Although the place was not in good condition but the Rib Eye Kebab I had was good ."}
{"text":"The wife and I loved this place.  We went for restaurant week and got a 3 course set up.   first off best thing about this place is they are flexible.  most restaurant weeks don't let you make any substitutions our waitress Michelle was very sweet and accommodating.  My wife and I got the burrata, scallops, and desert.   I got a apple strudel which was good, but I really wanted KAY like pie which they ran out of.  my wife because they ran out of the pie asked for a crepe instead which they custom made for her because she didn't like the crepe options.   Literally everything was amazing.   the scallops are not on menu yet but they are coming.  we'll be back as soon as they are on there again!   the burrata was incredible so I highly recommend it.   for drinks the wife got the endless summer and loved it.  I got this whiskey smash drink that was bomb.  it tasted like a cherry Coke but has interesting twists in it.   as far as some of the complaints about the music.  yes it is  loud and even though I deducted a star for that.  I wouldn't say it's something that should deter you.  if they just turned the music down literally 2 notches it would be perfect.   I'll be honest though I think the volume of music actually fits the scenery as it's supposed to be a cool upstate montalk bar.  so I think it accomplishes it.   we sat in a booth next to each other and could hear each other just fine.   I would imagine the happy hour scene and brunch scene is awesome here.   it's super cool set up inside and very welcoming.  people wear a big range in clothes.  I wore jeans and a button up.  a lot of guys had t shirts and shorts.  some had slacks.  so you won't be under or over dressed no matter what you wear.   anyway go!  we loved it and we will go again."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place from a waiter at my hotel, but it wasn't for me. 

The food portions were too small, and it took 35 min for my food to arrive. I'll not be visiting again if I'm ever in town for business again."}
{"text":"Iv come here so many times and I definitely like during the day better than night but both are amazing but the day.... Hands down my favorite place to spend the day and get drinks and food with good people ... If you get a chance for Joel or max to help you that day you will have the best day ever !"}
{"text":"Saturday lunch: good but slow service. I think they might be understaffed. Music was WAY too loud and food was solid. I had the classic crepes and hubby had the standard breakfast. Decor was just what you would expect for a place named \"Montauk.\""}
{"text":"Two of us went there for Saturday morning brunch. I'm giving it one star only because giving it negative stars is not an option. My guess is that the only reason this place stays in business is because of its location and unknowing tourists.

I love crepes and order them every chance I get. While the bacon, onion, havarti, egg combination sounded perfect on a cold, rainy day, the execution failed miserably. First, these are not crepes--they are tortillas, and not even good tortillas. They are pre-made, packaged, thick, stiff and flavorless. The onions were rancid and overwhelming. The bacon was soggy. The Havarti cheese never had a chance of melting because the other ingredients were stone cold. Thankfully, the \"crispy\" potatoes were edible, though there was nothing crispy about them--they were baby reds that had been sautéed with some oil. 

And how hard is it to pull off a breakfast sandwich? It, too, was cold and the huge bun completely overwhelmed the inside ingredients. My friend will eat anything--it's the first time I've ever seen food left on his plate. 

The service was timely, but the servers inexperienced, and after taking our ordered were never seen again. We had to ask a bus boy to get our check because we never saw our waitress again. We tipped her 20%, because we are generous and have been in the industry in the past ourselves, but a less understanding couple would have stiffed her. 

Scottsdale has no shortage of good restaurants. This is not one of them. For brunch you would be better served going to the Breakfast Club or Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch.  The warm lobster rolls are amazing.  The fish was delicious, light and crisp.  Great service, attentive servers.  Nice to have an interesting menu with nice variety."}
{"text":"The food is good. We had wings and the fish tacos. The wings are delicious!! The service is slow though. Our waiter gave us the check and didn't come back for a long time and the restaurant was empty. Overall I would recommend!"}
{"text":"The service and food was great! Morgan and Kerri took care of us! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here Friday night.  We sat in the lounge area with nice comfortable sofas.  I ordered the Mexican Firing Squad, which was VERY GOOD.  My date ordered the Watermelon Mule, which she enjoyed greatly.  We both shared drinks and thought the drinks here phenomenal.

We ordered the coconut lemongrass ceviche.  The plate was interesting and somewhat sweet tasting.  Not the kind of ceviche I am normally used to.  My date thought it was great.

Overall a good time here.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This sits somewhere between a 2 and 3 for me. We went on a busy Saturday night but we're able to get a table for 6 people. Maybe a bad sign. We waited entirely too long to get a waitress, entirely too long to get waters and cocktails, and our food came out for each person over the course of 30 minutes. I'm not sure if they were down a server but we were not the only unhappy table. 

Once we got our food, however, we were very pleased. Better than expected given the rest up until then. The fish tacos were very good and a large serving for $12. Haystack fries, crispy Brussels sprouts, and lobster roll all excellent as well. Good prices for good portions, just have to mind the wait for service."}
{"text":"Thanks to our server, Austin I will start coming back. Multiple times, my friends & I have received sub par to just horrible service here & only return for the food. This last experience was \"surprisingly\" better. Austin was very timely, friendly, attentive & never let our drinks sit empty. On a sunny (patio day ) day, that's important. Our food actually didn't take over an hr, wow!!!! We ordered the Kale (add Shrimp) salad & the mac & cheese (entree) The Trade Secret & Watermelon Mules, are our favorite specialty cocktails. I love their patio!!!! Thank you Austin for making my brunch experience \"better\" here."}
{"text":"The food was not terrible but the service was pretty slow. They were busy, but not to a point where it was understandable. We waited 45 minutes for the food which came out Luke warm to cold. Asked for raw onion on the chicken sandwich and a side of mayo. It came with grilled onions and no mayo. After asking 3 times for a slice of raw onion and waiting 15 minutes for it, the food was cold and rubber. They took the sandwich off the bill but offered no substitute or even to make it again. 
With so many options in Scottsdale I would never go back."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant! It was great for brunch and now I have a \"go to\" spot for lobster rolls! I gave 4 stars because everyone was really nice but they made us wait for 20 minutes (even though there were plenty of open tables and wait staff). Our food took almost 45 minutes to come out as well. It was delicious and I highly recommend, just make sure you don't have to go somewhere right after as it does take some time there. I had to be at a venue meeting at 2pm and was late."}
{"text":"Mike M...yup on the Cape cod decor. Except that it's loud. And our service was completely lackluster...not unfriendly, just absent. 

we were seated at a booth that was covered in food crumbs. I asked to have it cleaned only to now have a soaking wet seat, which i opted to dry myself rather than ask the staff again to clean the table. we waited long periods of time between drinks, water, food, bill, etc. She just was never there and we had to flag her down for nearly everything. 

if you don't eat meat, your options are miniscule. I had the green curry shrimp. it was good, i ate it all. it was fine, but nothing i would re-visit. for the steep 16 bucks , i can get a giant bowl of shrimp curry at a thai restaurant.

it's probably fun to sit here when it's sunny and have some drinks, doing some people watching."}
{"text":"Horrible service and NOT CLEAN!!!!!!!  What appeared to be dried snot and mucus (had little hairs in it)  on the salt and pepper shakers located on the outside table- deck area; facing Scottsdale road.   Strands of hair and lint on old utensil cloths.  Poorly responsive hosts at front stand.  I tried to flag one down since the server was busy and he looked me in the eye and ignored my \"excuse me sir\".   Place was pretty empty. Prime rib sandwich (fatty) soggy and the \"fried\" egg raw had loose yolk.  Due to the lack of cleanliness (and Poor quality food).  I only ate 10%  and was grossed out.  Didn't try to resolve it further because staff was blatantly  disinterested  in customer service.... ( even more so, service recovery).   Also it took the host 10 minutes to find a pen for me to sign the bill.  Normally, I leave a tip no matter what- but this time it was so bad I simply filled in the space on the bill with \"your tip will be my review on Yelp!\"  Go to breakfast club next door or  better yet,  McDonald's !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to! Love this place. Brunch & dinner is amazing. A little something for everyone. Chill vibe, great music, and THE SERVICE IS AWESOME! The whole staff is SO fun & management comes by at least once or twice to make sure everything is perfect."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place!!!! I came here in June for my bachelorette party and we stopped here. It was adorable and our server was so cute and sweet! I've come back here for happy hour and my husband and I enjoyed a bottle of Coppola half off! It was divine. I love the atmosphere and everything. I can't wait to try their incredible brunch!!! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Best things at this restaurant were the quacamole/tuna app & the watermelon mule. This is not a place to talk w/ friends or getting to know someone. It's an excessively loud environment and the food is not worth the effort or prices. My husband had a burger which was nothing special; \"very average.\" I had the chicken kabobs and kale salad. The chicken was not seasoned, bland and tasteless. The kale salad was so vinegar soaked it was inedible. Although our server was very good, dinner was disappointing. After one bite of the kale salad, and two bites of chicken, I sent the majority of my meal back, and no offer to comp me the meal or remove it from the bill.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Menu is wonderful.  Food is great.  Service is awful.  If you observe you will notice people my age are not dining there.  It seems to be more for the drinkers that could care less when their food comes.  I have attempted three times and all three times it is the same old same old.  Empty tables and the kitchen can't handle it.  This is ok once in a while, but every time?! 
So, if you are wanting to try out this fabulous menu before or after a play or movie...be prepared to wait over 45 minutes for your food.  So sad.  So disappointing.  \"Mikey\" right in my face told me he basically could care less if I ever come back.  This was his attitude when I asked him what was going on with the food taking so long.  Supposedly he is the manager.  So unprofessional.  49 minutes to get our food.  I was warned up to 30 but 49 was just not right and what was even more wrong was \"mikey\"!"}
{"text":"I love the decor and the menu sounds great but the actual food and the service fail to deliver.

We went for brunch this past weekend and I was so disappointed! 

It took quite a while for a server to greet us. We were considering asking the hostess to confirm she let someone know we had been seated but every time a server appeared we delayed, thinking surely they would acknowledge us any second. 

I had the warm lobster roll. It was real lobster - that's about all I have nice to say about it. It is served on a standard hot dog bun - so it's pretty tiny to boot. There was no evidence of dressing on the lobster and it was poorly assembled - the bun was not deep enough to accommodate the lobster (I'd estimate about 1/4c). There was a side of butter - but no signs of aioli (hint: it should look like mayo, not drawn butter) I know we are in the desert but at $20 there's a food truck in town that is a WAY better value and makes The Montauk's weak offering look bad.

The honey jalapeno chicken sandwich was another disappointment. The chicken was plain tasting - especially considering what the name would inspire your mouth to imagine.

I like the decor, the live music and the OJ that comes with the mimosa is very good. Another cool thing was that they had a  pancake artist offering super cool free pancakes (for tips) on the patio. The pancake, like everything else we ate here, was thin and flavorless -- but it really did look cool!"}
{"text":"Nautical themed restaurant with a classy yet casual feel. We love dining here for the fish tacos and of course the reasonable prices. Would certainly recommend this hip Scottsdale spot."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast spot when we come every year for spring training. Love the food and the open air setting. Never disappoints. Drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"We've been to The Montauk numerous times and we've always had a good experience. We love going for Happy Hour too.  The food, drinks, atmosphere and service are wonderful.  We loved having Skylar wait on us recently.  Outside of her efficient service, she knows how to assess her guest's personalities and responds appropriately.  My friend was teasing her and giving her a hard time (in a good way), and she dished it right back in a very professional and funny way.  We loved her.  We'll certainly come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Found it on accident. Delicious cocktails and good food. Our waitress Christina was amazing. She's so sweet and had good recommendations. I'll definitely return.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good deals, and the atmosphere brings you to a beachfront restaurant! Good for families, groups of friends, or a fun date!!"}
{"text":"We were attracted to this spot because our grandmother lived in Montauk and we summered there throughout our childhood. Unfortunately our experience was very disappointing. Once our party of 4 were seated we ordered our beverages, I ordered coffee and it came out cold --twice. My sister ordered an iced tea and was given a Coke. The entire beverage confusion lasted 30 minutes -  back-and-forth back-and-forth with long periods waiting for the right beverage. We ordered our entrées they never arrived, instead we were given four appetizer plates, we are not sure why since we did not order appetizers -- and the plates had dirt and grease on them. That was it. We left a $20 bill on the table for the beverages and we walked out. We never got an apology from anyone. Not from the bar back who brought out the Coke, not from the bartender who brought out the cold coffees, not from the waitress who brought out the dirty dishes. Honestly at that point, we were afraid to even eat the food if it ever came out. We walked across the street to a delightful restaurant called \"the breakfast club\" or something like that, and they served us instantly and the food was delicious. Too bad we so wanted to like the Montauk. I guess our memories of the actual town of Montauk will have to do."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I have been traveling to the Scottsdale area for over 6 months now and this is easily one of our favorite places. The food is great and we really enjoy the atmosphere. The Iive music on Wednesdays is some of the best we have seen but we usually spend our Monday nights at The Montauk. There is a bar tender named Shanna that takes care of us and she is outstanding. From food and drink recommendations to high quality service, you can't go wrong on a Monday night with her."}
{"text":"Great spot for a gathering of friends. We had some brunch and some drinks. Our section was not a normal table and chairs. It was more laid back and personable kind of like chilling at a friends house. 

The place is very clean and the bathrooms smelled like flowers. It's got kind of a boat/nautical theme I guess you would say. We will for sure be back again. The drinks were great and the food was actually really good. 

Recommend trying this place"}
{"text":"Love their lobster roll! The ahi tuna appetizer is also very good. Haven't had a chance to try other entrees because I always end up ordering the warm lobster roll."}
{"text":"The Montauk has quickly become one of my favorite Sunday day drinking spots with friends. The east coast atmosphere can make you forget for a minute that we are in the Arizona desert. Since the weather has been incredible lately we have been sitting out on the patio. I have always had decent service even when it's packed. I ordered the Endless Summer from their specialty cocktail list {Rose | Veev Acai | muddled strawberry & orange peel} and it is the perfect refreshing spring cocktail. The tuna tartare guacamole and deviled eggs with bacon and truffle oil have been consistently great. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great food either. The portions were huge and the ambiance is darling! However, our food was a bit bland.

A couple of us ordered the chicken kebabs. I loved the cauliflower \"fried rice\" that came with it. However the side salad had a very bitter dressing that was less than desirable and the kebabs needed some seasoning or a marinade. My husband ordered the fish and chips, and commented that they were just okay. He thought he fries that came with it tasted like they were cooked earlier that day. My mother in law didn't comment on her ceasar salad, but it looked delicious to me. I may order that next time.

I'll definitely give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and daughter this morning. The wait for the breakfast club was over an hour so we came across the street to the Montauk. I could not have been happier. We had the most amazing food and the staff...I can't say enough. We never wanted for anything. I created a yelp account just to let people know how wonderful it was. I have been in the industry for 15 years and I can definitely say that this place was created with true passion. I am not impressed very often, today I was blown away. My compliments to the chef, while I would not wait an hour for the Breakfast Club, I would wait an hour at the Montauk. It was that good."}
{"text":"Get the spark plug drink. It will put you in a great mood for a fun energetic time. Ask for the coffee ice cube since sometimes they forget it. Breakfasts are okay not memorable but not bad. If Breakfast Club is too packed then I go across to Montauk to eat. Also dogs allowed on patio area which is!  Live music on the weekends :)"}
{"text":"They did a nice job remodeling this place.  The white paint, eclectic furniture and open floor plan are very inviting.

Service was fast and friendly.  I enjoyed my Cherry Smash whiskey cocktail."}
{"text":"Very cool design...comfortable, inviting...great patio seating.  Craft cocktails are really good.  The bar manager came from Citizen RD...my first visit I had the High Tea.  Amazing flavors.  Second trip I had the Watermelon Mule...really refreshing, tasty and different.  The food both times was exceptional.  So far I've tried the ceviche (both times) - LOADED with shrimp, served in a coconut and the coconut flavor adds a great dimension to the dish.  The Tuna Tartare Guacamole was excellent.  The Grapefruit and Avocado Salad with Lobster is really delicious - highly recommend it.  The Lobster Wedge is also a beautifully-crafted plate.  Also tried the Green Curry Shrimp and substituted the brown rice with the Cauliflower fried rice - its not rice, its cauliflower shredded to simulate rice.  The dish was really flavorful.  I'll be heading back soon.  While the menu doesn't necessarily reflect the \"Hamptons Beach Cafe\" theme 100%, the design and casual vibe does in spades.  Having more indigenous food you get on Long Island would make this place that much more unique and appealing...and it would be easy to do.  There is a lot of great food found in these fun places out in the Hamptons.  Love it..."}
{"text":"I threw a baby shower for my sister in law here and had a wonderful experience! Starting with GR who set up everything, to our server Morgan who was fantastic. The food was outstanding and the drinks were excellent. I can't say enough good things about our experience!"}
{"text":"The price of the food was not worth the QUALITY.

No wait time; which may something about the business. The breakfast sandwich was great, but the food was just OK; nothing special at all.
  
There are too many restaurants in Old Town to just to be average."}
{"text":"Food here is bomb, but it definitely is popular because of the crowd. 

Clearly everyone pretty comes here after work for dinner.
We tried a bunch of different food, even though the service took a little bit and there was one messed up order, still give it 5, the guy who helped us was the only one working and definitely made it up to us. We'll be back on our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"It was hard to rate this. The food was really delicious but the service was awful!!! No one even took a drink order or said hello for 15 minutes after we were seated. But when we finally got served, The coffee cocktail was yummy! Big portions. Would give it another shot even with the bad service."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday and it was super busy with an event they put on. Aside from the loud music inside, the food was great! Decently priced, and great atmosphere, i cant wait to come back.
We ordered the burrata for a starter. I would have been happy having this for my meal! Super fresh, creamy and a pretty good portion for the two of us to share 
For the meal we ordered the cauliflower fried rice and kale salad w shrimp.  Both were really good! After trying the \"fried rice\", i was pleasantly surprised.  Excellent flavor, and a little lighter than rice would be, and such a unique dish. The kale salad was hearty and plenty! 
I liked that their menu selection wasnt too much, but what they had was well selected.
We didnt mind that the service was a tad slow...it was nice to enjoy the people i was with, and never felt rushed."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and friendly staff. Don't come hungry. The portions are ridiculously small. People must not come here for the food."}
{"text":"Trendy spot with a good atmosphere. The food not so much. The menu needs to be redone as it's ehh average. The location/music are great, but just not the food. It's a great spot if you're looking for drinks."}
{"text":"You come for the food, not the service. I came with a party of 4 for brunch on a Saturday morning. We sat at the bar- it took about 10 minutes to get waters from the bar back & 15/20 minutes to get the bartenders attention to order drinks and food. The food was amazing, but the bartender was not very personable. At the bar well, there was plenty of drinks that could have been ran, but servers would just stand at the bar and look completely lost or as if they were incompetent of running other servers drinks. I saw Alyssa multiple times look at drink tickets, realize they were not hers and put the ticket back down and continue to stand there. I feel like my whole hour visit I watched her stand around at the bar doing nothing. Like I said, the food is amazing, but the service- not that great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is AWFUL!!! The service is TERRIBLE!!! My friend had her bachelorette dinner here, and while I could not attend, I tried to buy bottles of alcohol for the table for when they arrived. I emailed the management team and called 4 separate times, just to try to coordinate the purchase. After finally getting through to the management team and after the payment went through, they didn't even deliver the wine. Additionally, I had to hear from my other friends that they never delivered it...NOT EVEN THE RESTAURANT! Horrible horrible service. Would not recommend coming to this restaurant. They clearly cannot handle parties."}
{"text":"Felt like I had stepped into an east coast beach bar. The ambiance was fantastic.

We were seated and never greeted by a server for a drink order. After flagging down a server we were fully enlightened on their specialty cocktail menu.
I ordered a \"spark plug\" which contained cold brewed coffee, vanilla vodka, Malibu, and a coffee ice cube. This was a fantastic drink.

In term of food I will never eat here again. The chicken in my cauliflower fried rice was tough and rubbery. It tasted as if it has been pre boiled then placed on the grill for marks

This may have just been this item, but I will be hesitant to eat here again"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience at this restaurant :) I went with my mom and my four year old daughter. The food was fabulous and the live music made for the best Sunday afternoon. Moriah was a complete slice of heaven. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was way better as The Bungalow. Way to church up a menu to the point its not appealing. The Chef needs to come back to reality. Truly poor menu."}
{"text":"The crispy wings and tuna tartare guacamole was very tasty. The service was non attentive. The fried rice with lobster was not flavorful and had an off after taste. The fish and chips, fried fish tacos, and burgers looked tasty. The kale salad was good but nothing special. They offered 2 desserts; key lime pie or Apple streusel both were not bad. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great cauliflower and rice side... But I think they should not try to serve lobster. It has no flavor except for the butter.  I will be back to try other fare."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio, slowish service but overall good ambiance and tasty food/cocktails."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Hip with a great vibe and energy. Lots of people but not crowded. The food is DELICIOUS. I saw there were comments about bad service, but every time I have been here, they are wonderful! Attentive and super nice. Try this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very darn good. Went to the Montauk when I was super hungover; had their bowl of memosas and their basic avacado and toast - it was on point! Def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible management. Six of us sat down and we were surrounded by empty tables. Took a half hour to get drinks and another twenty minutes to get our order taken. Then we were told it'd be an hour before we would get our food... and THEN when we ordered we were told they were out of avocado and half of their beers... The excuse was they had a Waste Management Open event yesterday. No duh, the entire city has had events for the golf tournament. At least be honest with us up front about your shortcomings as an establishment before you rope us in."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar Sunday night around 7pm for 10 minutes and had two bartenders pass us by with no hello or even a water to start. Finally, we have another person join our party and got a round of drinks. Good lord we couldn't hear anything because the music was so loud. We decided to resolve the issue by taking a booth spot in the corner, and were assigned the server named Michael. 

He completely turned around our experience by being overly attentive on our drink orders, appetizers and a friendly person to converse. 

We will be back for Michael, but they have to lower the music for sure! It was hard for my dad with hearing issues to keep a conversation with me."}
{"text":"I just need to say that the mac n cheese at this place was on point. The service was good, we were seated quickly and checked on several times during our meal. The only downside was that the music was pretty loud, so it may not be the best place to have a family dinner at. Other than that, I definitely recommend and will be going back."}
{"text":"Came back because the last visit was so delicious. Again, the food was really fresh and tasty. I am shocked it isn't busier, and highly recommend for locals. We brought our 19mth old w no problem."}
{"text":"The three stars are that I love the food here!  It's just amazing.  My personal favorites are the grilled chicken sandwich that comes with a kale salad.  It's nice and healthy!  I use to work right across the street from this place so I would often come in on lunch breaks or eat at the bar.  The reason I am not giving five stars is that I feel like the service really needs work!  I have an hour for lunch, and I literally spend sometimes more than an hour there especially when I order right away and tell them I have to be back to work.  When I asked how long on my food order I would get a snarky attitude from the bartender and say that it will be out shortly.  Again I would love to give this place 5 stars but I definitely feel like the service needs to be worked on, not sure if it's the server/bartender putting in my order late or the kitchen"}
{"text":"Been here once.  So far, a good/great experience.  Definitely a louder-than-normal experience for me, but hey, it was a Friday night.  Casual environment, sports on TVs, staff and service was excellent; I enjoy seeing smiling staff :-) I enjoyed seeing the comfy booths, although I and my fiancee had a table.  I ordered the salmon -- orange teriyaki sauce made it great.  Fiancee ordered lobster sandwich -- also a quite scrumptious choice!"}
{"text":"I tried Montauk and this restaurant the food really disappointed. I do like the ambience there and of course the beverages though."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!! Outstanding food and great service.  Great people watching and great outside seating.  The fish tacos and lobster roll are both amazing.  Young upbeat staff friendly and courteous.  Everyone working there looks like they are having fun.   I go there a lot and will continue to enjoy for lunch and dinner all year round.  I live in Scottsdale and I feel I have found a new jewel in Old Town."}
{"text":"Visiting tourist.

Our server was exceptional; however, the food wasn't amazing and the timing of the service was bad. I'm not sure if it was an off day but even the drinks took forever to come. 

Went with a group of 8 on a Saturday night. 

Things I ate:
Lobster roll: 3
Mac n Cheese: 3
Buffalo french fries?: 4.5

Ambiance: 3-3.5
Service: 3
Server: 5
Food: 3 for Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Came in with a friend of mine and sat at the bar. We waited to even get a greeting then decided to time the bartenders to see how long it would take them. Five extra minutes and the place wasn't busy. Unfortunate. Menu looked decent. Won't be back to give it a second try. First impressions are everything."}
{"text":"Can somebody please let the word out on this Scottsdale gem? Not pretentious, but simply fantastic. Being from the East Coast, this place feels like home. Just needs to inject the smell of salt water into the air and it would be home. Great menu, very reasonable pricing and attentive service. I travel to AZ often for work and will always make this a stop. Say hello to \"Nate\". A consummate pro."}
{"text":"Went to check out this restaurant on a late dinner Saturday night. Hostess said it was an hour wait. Although I did notice a handful of empty tables across the entire restaurant, which was odd. Anyways I went across the street for a drink. An hour later goes by and the table was ready. We come back and there's still plenty of open table or the same tables. Is getting people to wait an hour part of the hype? I sat down and ordered drinks and food. Food didn't live up to the hour wait hype... Other than that, great location and service was good. Might not return if there's an hour wait and at least 10 open table."}
{"text":"Food was not that great. It was supposed to be an aioli dressing on sandwich but it was very mustard like. Would get it without the aioli then it would be great will go back"}
{"text":"Beach front vibes sans the water....that's what you'll get at The Montauk! The bright interior and themed decor really does transport you out the desert for a minute. I was in town for work meetings and we came here. If you're looking for a quick thirty minute lunch, this might not be the most ideal place to go. Kudos to the team at Montauk for getting a group of at least 8 people in and out in about an hour! So many things on the menu caught my eye, but I'm a salad for lunch type...I just can't help it! I ordered the avocado and pink grapefruit salad and added shrimp. It's served with mixed greens, jalapeño, feta, pumpkin seeds with a vinaigrette. It was the perfect entree salad- delicious and nutritious! Others dishes ordered in our group were the lobster roll, truffle fries, tuna tartare guacamole and cauliflower flower fried rice. The minute we walked in, I swept away to Montauk and I'd definitely return for a more leisurely meal."}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant if you value your hearing.
The noise level was outrageous and the restaurant was not even filled.
No opinion on any other features because we could not even hear ourselves speak to each other!"}
{"text":"The Montauk has a great happy hour 3pm-6pm and $5.00 wine -Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and a Merlot.  The service was excellent, waters right away and happy hour menu listing all the specials. Tried the home made potatoe chips with onion dip and the hummus with veggies, brought out right away and both were very tasty.  Great location, great happy hour prices and awesome service.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD, GOOD VALUE, BUMPIN' SCENE...Bartending less so.

I try not to write reviews on single visits to be balanced and fair.  Last night was my fifth visit and I just can't get this place over 3 stars, average.

The GOOD:  food is reasonably priced and the menu and decor definitely reminds me of Montauk (small part of Long Island, a.k.a. The Hampdens where Manhattanites flee the summer heat).  The FISH TACOS have very clean flavor and very fresh fish but simply do not meet \"cravable\" status like Coconuts.  I think this because the slaw they are using is standard fare with no unique style.  The kitchen is great at adjusting to requests so maybe they will turn it up.  Other reviewers are chatting up the CAULIFLOWER FRIED RICE.  I agree, this is pleasantly flavorful.  I recommend getting it with lobster chunks as the dish is already slightly dry on the palate and white meat chicken enhances that negative.  A touch of an infused olive oil tossed in at the end would go a long way toward improving this one but still kudos for the creativity.  The LOBSTER ROLL (HOT) is a hit.  There is a place in Manhattan, called Mary's Fish Camp, that gets all kinds of positive press.  This dish could seamlessly jump on the menu and hold its own.

On one occasion (last night) the service was particularly chaotic and completely malfunctioned when a bachelorette party landed with their dick straws and selfie sticks.  The Manager came over after we had a series of post-meal drink misfires and chopped our $300 bill in half.  I would have settled for a round on the house but the Manager is clearly tuned for keeping this place in a good light.  I don't know if he recognized us as returning customers or this is his policy but that level of Manager awareness and remedy is very commendable.

Circling back to the scene, there is a solidly fun vibe to this beach house-style decor.  The DJ seems to never stop and plays a great spread of tracks. The upper deck couches are fun and comfortable and the table booths are equally set up to enjoy dinner while still being inside the buzz.  I would kick this whole review up a star if the house would grasp the concept that even Friday's understands...as the crowd grows, the music should NOT.  At risk of echoing the comments of other reviewers and sounding twenty years older, the scene is best early, ahead of the place reaching 50% capacity.   Look, we all like to feel the thump of base in our chests and rhythm in our feet but not at the expense of yelling at the persons we came with standing the length of a soda straw away.  I could get the same effect and a lower bar bill by just hanging at the bar, putting my friends on FaceTime then asking them to hit mute on their end.

THE MEDIOCRE:  Service is organizationally novice but the staff is incredibly upbeat and friendly, clearly trying with great intent.  Super friendly, just unskilled.  Plus, there are a number of menu misses.  Every version of their French fries are unimpressive.  Not bad per say, just unimaginative.  Buffalo-style anything is a nod to drunk frat boys blowing their money for the night on over priced drinks but realizing they gotta eat.  And putting that same Franks Red Hot sauce on potato chips is equally a miss.  The Mac-and-Cheese falls short of getting any attention.  In fact I had to rebook at the bill to even remember we ordered it.

THE BAD:  I have already crossed the noise level discussion.  The drinks are weak and even for Old Town, priced too high.  If you are going to charge $15 for Hendrick's , St. Germaine and soda then make it in a clean glass, make it constantly each time I order it consecutively and actually use Hendrick's.  These bartenders are routinely scrambling and I imagine they are getting very lucky that most guests are ordering drinks they only have to cork and pour, not mix.  I would only add, get rid of the bathroom attendant. It a relic concept that is simply creepy weird."}
{"text":"Love the patio! Great cocktails and tasty dishes!  Excellent service and love the lobster wedge salad & the chicken fried rice !  Yum!

Go see Tai the GM - he's the friendliest and will go above and beyond to make sure you have an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me whiners??? This place is 4 stars plus... all day....
Indoor/outdoor prime location... check... Classy inside... check.......great food.... check.....best bartender in Scottsdale (Candice is amazing).... absafinglutely. Just ask her what to get... she will hook you up.
The deviled eggs look boring but have a great bacon pop... the cauliflower rice with chicken is really tasty and unique. Loved it... I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the third time that we've been to The Montauk for brunch and had loved it so much that we decided to bring some of our friends from out of town with us. 
The food is great but unfortunately after the service we received today I don't think we will be returning. 
First, the host was rude seating us when we didn't want to sit at a lounge table outside, then apparently didn't tell any servers that we were there because it took a half hour for someone to finally touch our table. 
Second, when the food finally came one of our orders were wrong, and not only that, but we didn't get the corrected food until 20 minutes after everyone else had finished eating. It took telling three different people and the manager to finally get our food. 
And lastly when it was finally time to pay our server didn't come around for such a long time that we eventually got up to pay because we were tired of waiting. 
I've never done a negative review before but I just really hope that the message gets across to their staff how important having a sense of urgency and good communication is."}
{"text":"Wife brought me here on a Saturday night for my birthday.   We were seated promptly as the place was a ghost town.  We sat at our table for more than 10 minutes with nobody coming ton our table to take a food or drink order.  We finally got frustrated at being ignored and walked out.  The hostess thanked us for coming in as we walked out, hi-lighting just how oblivious and uncaring the staff is.  I hope our experience was the exception."}
{"text":"A Long Island beach house in the middle of the desert with a name that rang our bell: \" ... meet me in Montauk...\" 
( name the movie of this quote and win a prize! ) 
Truly, I, like Clementine, did EVERYTHING to forget and Joe, like Joel, did EVERYTHING to make me remember. So, when we came across this peculiar out of place, yet perfectly located, home of a restaurant we just had to try it! 
We weren't starving so we did not order entrees ... We were however, parched so we went for a cocktail and a seat on their front patio. It's winter in the US of A but forever summer in Scottsdale, AZ or so it feels. Beautiful weather to enjoy watermelon mules and people watch. 
The location is prime and from what we gathered a very popular spot among the locals. Everyone is friendly and the service was prompt without making us feel rushed. 
Our stay was short but we do intend on revisiting for brunch or some evening live music. 
A four star better than most for ambience and service."}
{"text":"A MUST!! Been here for brunch, lunch just as good! Morgan, our waiter was super friendly & his suggestions where spot on!! Tuna tartar guac was amazing!!!! My favorite was the burrata. Order the Trade Secret cocktail!!!!! Wish I had another one right now
Thanks Morgan"}
{"text":"I once loved Montauk. I've come here since they've opened. A new GM took over the helm recently (a few months now). I have sincerely given him the benefit of the doubt in spite of the decline in service since he's started. However, all good things must come to an end. Today, I was served chicken wings that were spoiled. I took one bite and immediately tasted that sour taste that you typically smell when you open a package of chicken that you waited too long to make. They had to have smelled it; the spoiled taste was strong. I sent it back and told the server that they need to take care of our meal. The manager came over, apologized, told us they would take care of it, and asked us if we wanted anything else. We ordered deviled eggs and a salad and they were good as usual. They took the spoiled chicken off of our tab and charged us for everything else. I'm not sure if they think that we should be appreciative of them taking the spoiled chicken off of our tab, but I paid it and left. Spoiled chicken is a sure way to get food poisoning. My guess, they don't care. I will take my business elsewhere. I'm thinking Farm & Craft."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place as its so close to my Pilates studio so went yesterday for lunch. When I asked the bartender Veronica how the tuna tartare was she said \"oh it's good it's not like the tuna from the can its a different tuna\" ummm Duhhhhh but ok I said is it Ahi, she said not sure but it's not from a can. Ok then! I proceeded to ask what the difference of the lobster on the salad was in comparison to the lobster on the lobster rolls .... She said \"oh I don't know it's shredded lobster\". I said ok but what part of the lobster is it from the claw or the tail or what ?  She said \"the inside\" of the lobster. WOW!!! Pls train and educate your staff. Thanks."}
{"text":"I was visiting some friends in town and heard that the Montauk was a new place so I decided to give it a try. Well I kept things pretty simple and ordered the fish taco and the kale salad. The salad was overdressed and pretty bland, and the taco was soggy and bland as well. There are much better places in town."}
{"text":"What an awesome little gem of a place! Beach vibes, awesome drinks & great location! Morgan was a rockstar server! I highly recommend the Mac & cheese dish, lobster roll or jalapeño chicken sandwich nomz nomz"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! My sever Mitch was fantastic! He recommended the best appetizers and drinks. Highly recommended to anyone trying to have a great time!"}
{"text":"We were walking past here and attacted to the open air floor plan.  That said there was no signage of any kind yet since it just opened. I guess they may have opened a little earlier than anticipated to take advantage of the high volume of Superbowl visitors in Old Town.  That said, for a brand new restaurant in their first week of operation I was overall pretty happy.   A few notes:

1) we asked about happy hour as we'd seen prominent displays of Happy Hours for other local restaurants.  The guy we asked (who was busy rearranging chairs so they'd match the right tables) said they haven't started yet and wouldn't because it was Superbowl week and people are going to buy drinks anyway.  He said no one is going to do Happy Hour this week (yet, this place was not even close to being full, so it didn't make a lot of sense to me ... aren't happy hours to drive people in?  Plus other places definitely had Happy Hours).  So if you're expecting a happy hour special call them first to make sure they have it.  It wasn't why we stopped by so it wasn't a big deal to us.
2) our waitress was pretty attentive and all our food came to our table quickly and exactly as expected from the menu descriptions.  No complaints on that.  Great service overall
3)  I wasn't crazy with the tartness of the \"Token Kale Salad\" ... it was okay, but no where near the best Kale Salad I've had.  I think token describes it. They wanted a Kale Salad on the menu, but they're no where near perfecting the recipe.  
4)  They need some healtiher fried options.  All the options seemed either friend or loaded with butter.  Even the sweet corn side I ordered to have with my salad was loaded in butter (it was super tasty, but totally loaded in butter).

Overall we decided to give this place a try as we wanted to eat outside and enjoy the gorgeous weather (since we're from the northeast and going back tomorrow).  Would I go back here?  Maybe, but honestly I'd probably try other local restaurants first or go back to the Original Chop Shop which offers more healthy options and is a lot more vegetarian friendly.  I didnt have many vegetarian options on the Montauk's menu."}
{"text":"I'd give this a big fat zero if possible. Made a reservation earlier in the week for 8 girls. Got there and they didn't even look in their books, simply said they had an event and didn't have reservations. All I was offered was left over breakfast burritos. No thanks."}
{"text":"Morgan was an awesome server and showed superb customer service. This was my first time at Montauk but it won't be the last.. I highly recommend this beautiful classy restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Top notch server who brought the best coffee this side of Starbucks. Great hamburger and lobster roll."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. SERVICE. AVOID. AT. ALL. COSTS. NOT WORTH IT. Good food and good drinks but absolutely terrible service. I was there on a Sunday night which meant the restaurant was very empty and slow, it still took 15-20 minutes just to get a drink delivered. The food took about half an hour it took 20 more minutes from the time we requested our check to when we actually got it."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here and had excellent service. They have a very laid back atmosphere and amazing menu. The Mac and Cheese and Kale salad are both on point. I had a great experience and would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Montauk has become my favorite brunch spot! It's their prime rib benedict that has me waking up early to fight for a table. It's amazing. The staff and management are always very very welcoming. Alec has taken care of us multiple times and is very pleasant and efficient. Mikee always stops by to check in and make sure everything is to our liking. If you haven't tried their benies you need to. If you appreciate a good view the girls here are dimes."}
{"text":"We went to Montauk for the first time last night and will definitely be back!  The food was delicious and our server Skyler was delightful!"}
{"text":"What a charming atmosphere and delicious brunch. I had the rare pleasure of having an adult brunch without my children. We chose the Montauk because of the short wait time and great patio seating, but we fell in love with the beachy atmosphere, the bloody Mary's and the eggs sandwich with avocado and Swiss. Mmmmmm! My mouth is watering. The John Mayer acoustic cover was the perfect compliment to a laid back atmosphere and cozy bench seats, perfect for some cuddles. I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Had such a fun lunch here! Went with friends to start off a bachelorette party. Logan was a fantastic waiter, and they gave us free shots! Food was also phenomenal."}
{"text":"Had a fab visit to Montauk on Saturday.  Food was fantastic, lobster roll warm so yummy. Our server Morgan was great. Cool, clean vibe, indoor/outdoor seating, music playing. A must visit while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The environment and music was great. Great service, very tentative but not overly tentative. Ceaser salad was delicious, the House burger was good but was a little over portioned with the amount of onions, pickles and so forth. Overall the food is 7/10 but the atmosphere is definitely 10/10."}
{"text":"Came with girl friends for drinks and dinner.  Did not like our drinks and the food was average.  The server was excellent and the chef came out to serve our meals.  Cute decor and ambiance but not thw best food and drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sunday brunch is definitely a happenin' place, people drinking & loud music. Came here with 9 people on Sunday around 12:30 before a Giants spring training game & it was pretty packed but not too bad. We got two bottles of champagne (not the real stuff) for $40 each & it comes with some juices -- orange, grapefruit, mango. My boyfriend & I split the burrata and deviled eggs appetizers -- total being $17, not bad. I have gotten the Lobster Roll before which I loveeeeeee but its hard for me to justify spending $20 on the lil thing."}
{"text":"food was amazing! everything tasted fresh.  the knock on this place was the service.  Never refilled our drinks, our orders where wrong.  Manager looks like teenager and just doesn't care.  if service was better we would go back!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here for happy hour. When we arrived at 5:30 we thought it was odd that the restaurant was sparse. We had to ask for the happy hour menu. When we tried to order we were told that four of the HH food items were not available. Unbelievable... No wonder the place was empty. Good luck Montauk surviving in the competitive Scottsdale market."}
{"text":"Could not love this place more!!! It has a super beachy, contemporary, vibe. The patio is gorgeous and the service is amazing. Our server, Morgan, was super cool. The food is DELICIOUS! They have a parking lot so even though its in old town, parking is a breeze. Definitely recommend this place for a lunch with family, friends, etc."}
{"text":"I highly recommend The Montauk... everything from the food, to the atmosphere, to the music, to the management.. TOP NOTCH. Thanks to Dillon for making our experience the best ever. I've been there on several occasions and my favorite time is Sundays for Brunch. Get there early though!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place the coveted 5 star rating for one reason . The happy hour . They have a great outdoor seating with big comfy benches and chairs great for sitting with friends and enjoying some happy hour goodness . They have one of THEE best happy hours in old town . 3$ for a fresh squeezed IPA ?!  They also have an array of hand crafted cocktails and other beers on tap but the fresh squeezed is where it's at . The food on happy hour is equally impressive , the bruschetta and and Buffalo hay stack fries are my favorite but I also have a place in my heart for the chicken sliders . The atmosphere is wonderful from the bar area , patio down to the well kept bathrooms . Definitely check this place out on happy hour or for a nice lunch/dinner cheers!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really did. Tried to like it several times in fact. The service just killed it for me. Every time. The level of apathy that the wait staff and hostesses possess is almost comical. It's like they're actually trying as hard as they can to suck. 

Anyways, this place is situated in a really cool spot on Scottsdale road. Great people watching spot. As the name implies, you get that summer in the Hamptons feel with the decor (the snobby attitudes as well). 

The food really isn't anything to boast about. Prime rib sandwich was very dry but has the potential to be good. They didn't skimp on the meat which was nice. My friend ordered avocado toast and they just brought out toast with no avocado. I mean cmon. It's in the name on the menu. Needless to say the waitress expressed no interest in my friends quarrel with the toast and finally brought out avocado toast about 25 minutes later. 

The drinks were actually pretty good ( I got the watermelon mule) but not good enough to allow me to give this place more than 1 star. Your service and general attitude just killed it for me. Work on your CRM skills a little bit and this place could be killer. 

This place has great potential given the location but unfortunately as long as this is still The Montauk, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"First time in today and it was super chill, the food was great and drinks were too. The atmosphere was nice and they had the best fish tacos! I also ordered an endless summer and was so worth the $10 lol definitely coming back..... ps happy hour is from 3-6 so we got $3 Stella's as well"}
{"text":"Very expensive for so-so food.  The best part of my meal was the kale salad.  Actually, that was the only redeeming part of the whole meal.   My son loved his lobster sandwich, but it was $20 for 1/2 cup of lobster on a tiny hot dog bun.  Also, DO NOT get talked into ordering the \"amazing bread pudding\"!  It's dry, cold and awful!"}
{"text":"Rebecca was a great server! Awesome service and super friendly! Would recommend this place. Great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool looking atmosphere. The drinks also appear to be fresh and tasty! The only thing I would change is the green (carpet?) 'grass' as the floor. If you come - request Morgan hill. He's a super nice guy and will make your experience worth it!"}
{"text":"My wife and i came for breakfast on a Saturday and sat at the bar.  

Pros:  
-beautiful restaurant with great decor and ambience that makes you feel like you are in Key West or other resort beach city. 
-live music and DJ
-prices were reasonable, good value
-indoor and outdoor seating with giant sliding windows 

Cons:  
-food was slow to come out. We waited 45 min
- service was lacking.   Missing utensils, ask for condiments and no one brought it.  Waited 10 minutes for a drink, etc, etc. 
-staff isn't very attentive. 

I would come back for drinks but not for food.  It could be a great restaurant but it fell short on my trip."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill and the crowd is strange now to say the least. Drinks are okay."}
{"text":"I like salads but I'm not a salad enthusiast BUT I got a side kale salad and OMG. It was seriously the best salad I ever had. I've thought about it several times since then. My main entree was good too. I also had a cocktail that was delicious but not cheap. The patio is pet friendly and my dog enjoyed chilling out. The atmosphere is so cute and trendy without trying too hard. They had live music that was really awesome as well."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for Sunday brunch! We sat on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere. The bar is well stocked. Service is casually paced. The wife had the breakfast sandwich which looked amazing. The daughter had a berry crepe which was super sweet! I had a burger with caramelized onions which was nicely prepared. Just a great spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for a drink. Slow service than on previous visits. My husband had a Bloody Mary. The first one was good and came with garnishment of bacon and olives, lemon and lime. My wine was a short pour.  The second round, again my wine was a short pour and my husbands Bloody Mary was horrible! Overwhelming tabasco, no bacon. Not sure if they changed bartenders or what. Whatever the excuse this but this bartender needs a little education how to mix drinks before being allowed behind the bar. No food this time but last time we were here the food was not that great. 
When it was the Bungalow it was run much better and the food and drinks were much better too. Maybe it should go back to the old owner and staff."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch , lunch, or dinner with friends. Atmosphere inside reminds me of an Americana boat party. Highly recommend for the successful twenties-thirties crowd."}
{"text":"Words can't express how great this place is! Great concept, staff, bar and food. It's unique layout and delicious food is what Scottsdale has been missing."}
{"text":"Love this place.. Great brunch spots with a nice atmosphere. I highly suggest checking this spot out to see for yourselves."}
{"text":"This is the best yelp review ever.  This is an incredible yelp review.  This yelp review is magical.  Wow, what a yelp review.  Woo!  Love this review."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I had never been to the bungalow so can't compare lookswise but being a new yorker, this place is amazing and really reminds me of bars/ restaurants on the east end of Long Island. All that's missing is the sand and ocean! I highly recommend the fish tacos, they were delicious. The only reason this is not a 5 star for me is the drinks are really expensive. I think the cocktail I ordered, while delicious was something like $14 dollars and the glass wasn't even filled to the top. It had an enormous square ice cube in it too, which while cool looking- it didn't leave a lot of surface area for the glass to be filled with alcohol- which is what you want for $14 a glass. For that reason, I only ordered one drink, and am hesitant to make this a place for regular visits. They also need to figure out their happy hour and didn't have any desserts available, although there were some listed on the menu. 

I think they still have a bit more growing to do so I'll give them a month or so and try it again, but I'm definitely a fan and loved the ambiance both indoors and on the patio!"}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place because I wanted to love it.

Let me start off by saying it's an Instagrammer's dream. So many cute spots to take trendy photos and they have a fun little wall in the back you can take pictures in front of.

That being said, a restaurant isn't just about what kind of photos you can take there...

We went for brunch on a Saturday and it was steady but not packed. We were quoted a 30-40 minute wait which was fine and we actually only waited like 20-30... So that was good!

The Deviled Eggs were so good!!!!! I think they were my favorite part of the meal. The crispy bacon on top is delish.

I got the Cold Lobster Roll with Fries and honestly, for $20, I just wasn't super impressed. I mean, it wasn't BAD but it wasn't phenomenal. The bun they used was the best part. I've had better lobster rolls from other restaurants. The fries were horrible. Like cold, hard and almost inedible and I think I ate one or two and then stopped. Ketchup could not save them.

Hubby got the Breakfast Burrito with Ribeye and he said it was okay. Needed some kind of sauce in it to pull it all together. The french fries inside it made everything dry and the guacamole that was supposed to be in there was kind of non-existent. He also said the \"crispy new potatoes\" were meh.

The service was also awful. Possibly the worst waitress I've ever had? She just had such a bad attitude and made us feel as though we were bothering her....... Girl. You're a waitress.... You wait on people as your job..... She seemed so annoyed just doing basic server duties like taking our order and refilling our drinks. Definitely not customer service that makes me want to come back and try again."}
{"text":"Ive had my birthday here the past two years, and the staff and manager have always been so accommodating. The food is fantastic and the drinks are so good!! Always recommend this to a friend!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday around noon.  It was SO LOUD we could barely hear the waitress. We shared the New England Clam Chowder for appetizer and it was a great choice.  Best I've had in years. We ordered a Cesar salad to split but they brought the entree first, so we cancelled it.  For the main course we each ordered a hot lobster roll and it came with potato chips. It was tasty but we ended up reordering the cesar salad because we were still hungry.  I think they should offer 2 sides with the lobster roll to satisfy appetites and make it worth the $20 they charged for it.  That said, I would go back for the clam chowder."}
{"text":"Late Saturday night visit, a bit too loud for my liking. Food was good (just mac n cheese for me). Good service. I hear brunch is suppose to be good. I'll have to try it my next visit."}
{"text":"Good food for lunch, had the fish tacos but very slow getting the food. Took 45+ minutes after ordering to get our food after being promised multiple times it was on its way. When it finally arrived the waiter made a rude comment."}
{"text":"This place is cute but the food and the service are very underwhelming. I won't likely go back. To start when we arrived it was a 15 minute wait regardless of all the open tables. Started with a the rosè sangria. Basically it was a glass of ice, with rosè and a couple berries in the bottom. Disappointing. For food we order the the house made chips, prime rib sandwich, clam chowder and lobster roll. The chips were good but we added Cholula hot sauce and they were way better. Clam chowder tasted like it came from a can. Prime rib sandwich was super fatty with a soggy bun. And the lobster roll was decent, but was a lot of bun with a little lobster. The service was beyond slow. We were there or just under 2 hours for just dinner alone. Our waitress was very nice, but just slow."}
{"text":"Brunch on NY Day...a treat with enticing cocktails, salads, sandwiches and egg dishes.  We had perfect Bloody Marys, chicken crepe and burger.  Exceptional service and relaxing live music."}
{"text":"Trying new brunch food!!! Unfortunately, they were understaffed during our time here, but we were very understanding of the situation. My boyfriend would not stop talking about this place so we finally made some time to come visit for brunch! Needless to say, I was not disappointed! The location is straight in old town, and the atmosphere is great! Loud music and great vibes on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Unrealistically displeased with the service I recently received at The Montauk. I have never had a ruder bartender. This place was super packed with an event that was being held -which as a member of the food industry myself, I can completely understand service can be slightly slower than normal at times and I respectfully leave room for error- However we were not greeted by anyone when we sat at the bar, our first order was incorrect, the bartender was unwilling to bring us bleu cheese olives when they were ordered for a vodka martini, saying that the kitchen was \"too backed up\", and on top of that we were brought an outdated tab. So when we closed out and received our cards back we were shocked to see we had been charged an extra 20 dollars with out a word. 
It's one thing when mistakes occur, but it's another when you are treated poorly in an environment you expect the opposite.

I am rating two stars because I have been here twice before and had a pleasant experience both times. Sad. This however, deserved a review. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"I recently went to The Montauk and had a great experience. The atmosphere and ambiance had a warm and pleasant feel to it. The craft cocktails were delicious and our meal was great. Our server, Christina, was sweet and fun, yet still professional. I'm looking forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Ehhh spot, but in a great location. You're better off going to Cold Cheeseburger down the street. Food is overrated , and the drinks watered down. Rude service, and I'll not be going back again."}
{"text":"Logan Couch is the best server. He made our experience enjoyable and was upbeat. I would come back again just to see him!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back here!

I came here to meet up with some old college friends for lunch. I ordered the burger...AMAZING. I haven't had a burger that good in a long time. I look forward to trying the rest of the menu!

GREAT atmosphere, cool decor, and decent prices."}
{"text":"Went today after seeing the awesome pictures of the lobster roll and was so disappointed. It looks nothing like the picture. No chunks of meat it was all shredded and so small. Not worth the price tag of $20. The fish tacos were ok but nothing special that you can't get somewhere cheaper. The watermelon mule doesn't taste like watermelon and it's worth $12! I will not be coming back. I was so excited for this place but left hungry and wanting a good lobster roll."}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow, food was ok. We went here because the place across the street's wait was too long. Nice ambiance though. Although we did sit at the bar. The bartenders were pretty busy. So it might be different if you're seated at a table. Not horrible, but not awesome."}
{"text":"Food was great, service is crazy slow.  SLOWWWWWW

I wouldn't complain if it was super busy. However, it really wasn't.  Our waitress was in fact very friendly, but it waas painful.  45 minutes to get our food, we ended up going to the bar to get our own drinks. this was *after waiting 20 minutes for a table and there waas many empty ones while we waited. 

it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome patio and amazing service people. We had dinner and people watched during spring training and absolutely loved it. 
It was my first time having a lobster roll and I think I'm hooked! I also recommend the wings and skewers, they were fun and delicious. Lastly, the cocktails were so good that my friends ended up staying until they closed. Lol. 
We will be back for sure. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the location, atmosphere, and decor of this place.  I really want to like it but...ugh....it's just not well run.  I was there over the weekend and nobody could decide who was supposed to serve us. Took forever to get served. Finally....we got a Bloody Mary...and oops...they forgot the bacon slice.  Isn't that part of the signature bloody?  Also, the olive was just grotesque.  Instead of green...it was mostly brown like it was rotten or something.  Then we got the deviled eggs with salmon.  No salmon.  They said it was on the inside.  Hmm....never found any. We got a couple of salads after that.  Ingredients missing.  A waiter gave us excuses about how they didn't expect a crowd today. Wow.  ok.  Too many other good choices in Old Town.  I'm done trying Montauk."}
{"text":"Make that four stars five!  In my previous review I said that I would have given it a five if the music hand been turned down a couple of notches.  Yesterday it was, and the food was every bit as good.  Somebody in the kitchen really pays attention.  It's very hard to avoid over cooking corn if your attention slips for even a minute.  Yet this place nails it every time."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon The Montauk while out exploring downtown Scottsdale.  It was 5 on a Wednesday so it was happy hour.  Love the patio.  The decor is fun and different.  The service was great, we had our kiddos in tow and everyone was real attentive to them and helping us know what to order for them.  Mac n cheese was a big hit!  All the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I were very pleased with our first time experience we had here. The prime rib sandwich hit the right spot for lunch. The only thing I would say is they can give more fries. The portion of fries was really small. But that doesn't discourage me from saying it's one of our new favorite spots."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place. Atmosphere is second to none, with food to match. The deviled eggs are a great choice to start your dining experience. If you like seafood go for the warm lobster roll and thank me later!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Lovely wine choices by the glass and unique menu. I met a business friend for happy hour and it was the right interior design - a modern boat house with a casual vibe"}
{"text":"Worst bar service in town.  Completely ignored while waiting to order a drink at the bar, finally served a drink like I was an annoyance.  Picked up the glass which had sticky fingerprints all over it, asked for a new glass which was equally as dirty.  Place was cute, has potential, but will never go back, too many good choices with much better service and clean glassware."}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  It's good enough but then..... I purposefully went early this morning to put our name down for a table of 8.  It's March.  In Scottsdale.  It's high season and they're busy.
I live here, I get it.
The two hostesses were the snarkiest, rudest, most unaccommodating people I have encountered in quite some time.  There are simply too many really solid choices within 200 yards of their front door.
Life is too short to be a patron of a restaurant who treats \"customers\" this way.
I went right up Stetson to The Herb Box where they were lovely and found a way to seat our party of 8.  They didn't martyr, they didn't roll their eyes.  The hosts at The Herb Box were lovely.  The food was great and so was the service.  The Herb Box is beautifully decorated and has gorgeous, cool restrooms, too.  The location is fabulous on top of everything else.
Most importantly though; the people were kind.
I'll go there first next time.
And you know where I won't go again?  The Montauk.  Too many great choices for that nonsense.  Breakfast Club is a great choice, too."}
{"text":"Amazing improvement over the Bungalow. The food and drinks are great! Morgan made our experience even better,  ask to sit at any one of his tables, you will be happy!"}
{"text":"We really like the montauk. The food and drinks are awesome, and so is the environment. But the service is hit and miss. We will continue to come here! Just wish the service was better."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Showed up to have dinner with my family on a Monday night and was told by the manager that the restaurant was about to close even though we still had an hour and half before closing time. He seemed rude and annoyed we were there Then as we left he yelled at us out the door that he was trying to do us a favor."}
{"text":"Love this place. Just come and bring friends; you won't leave disappointed.

The staff are so friendly and remember you're a regular. 

The outside seating is awesome. Go outside."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love this place, but I'm disappointed that they've gone a bit downhill. 

Pros: Great atmosphere with live music (sometimes). I also love their drinks and the appetizers always hit the spot. 

Cons: I've tried many things on the menu and they're just not tasting as good as they used to. They are also giving you less food than they used to. I live walking distance to this restaurant so it used to be my go-to, but the service had been consistently horrible for the past few months. Even when it is slow the staff is still not very attentive. 

I'd come back for the drinks, but probably not for the food anymore!"}
{"text":"This place kinda sucks. Waited 35+ min for food and it was ok. It was not busy when i got here and ordered. Draft beer is cheap during happy hour though."}
{"text":"This place has a fun nautical theme and a trendy atmosphere. I like that the menu has healthy options and I like that they serve food late night. It's a nice place to go if your starting off with a late dinner. There's usually a dj playing on the weekend. Location is convenient and walking distance to fashion square and surrounding bars/clubs."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch and a cocktail with my wife.  The wife ordered the Avocado and Pink Grapefruit Salad with a Trade Secret.  She loved every bite of the salad and every sip of her drink.  She liked the salad because it wasn't overly sweet, there was a nice balance.

I ordered the Wedge without lobster and a Spark Plug.  The Wedge was what you would expect, bacon, bleu cheese, tomatoes, but they also add summer squash and cucumbers.  These additions added a very nice variation to the standard wedge.  The Spark Plug is a bit strong in the beginning, but if you allow the coffee ice cube to melt a bit, it becomes extremely smooth cold brew coffee with creamer.

Together, we shared the coconut lemongrass ceviche.  I am known for getting ceviche whenever and wherever I can.  I can honestly say, this is one of the best ceviches I have had in the world. There is a nice sweetness to balance out the salty.  I will warn you though, there are fresh jalapeños, which will provide a kick, but this kick is balanced out very well with the sweet and salty.

The only issue we had was when our waitress brought my wife the wrong drink.  The waitress entered a watermelon mule instead of the Trade Secret.  My wife tried one sip of the mule and did not like it, but recognized it as having none of the properties the Trade Secret was said to have.  When the waitress was made aware, she quickly apologized and bright the correct drink within a few minutes.

Overall, the food was amazing, the service was good, but very responsive to questions and mistakes, and the atmosphere was good, but a little worn."}
{"text":"For a random choice one night for happy hour, we were pleased! We sat at the bar and had a great time - the place was packed too! Being from the east coast, I had to try the chowder. It definitely wasn't like home - but still tastey. Lots of clams. In my opinion - it could have been thicker with fewer veggies but more potatoes. The flavor was there though! We had the mac and cheese as well as the fish and chips - both really good as well! They had more east coast flavors that we will try when we go for a formal dinner but all in all, I would say they had a great vibe, great food and great drink of course!"}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere, location--all ON POINT. It's a struggle for me to find anything negative to say whatsoever, which is a big deal in the restaurant biz, especially coming from someone who worked in the industry for 8+ years.  I know I already touched on this, but this place is absolutely beautiful, the servers are knowledgable and friendly, and the food is to die. The Poke and Won ton chips...omg, can I go back now!?"}
{"text":"Great food / awful service (no flatware & napkin until after food served, unable to get a drink with our meal, busser walked by 3x & looked at empty glasses & dirty plates).  Loud music.  It's great for day drinks."}
{"text":"If you want a place for a drink, this is a great place to go. If you're hungry? Do. Not. Eat. Here. In all the years this establishment has been open, they have not perfected their menu. The food isn't fresh. I'm not kidding. I have eaten here a handful of times hoping the food would be great. I feel it's only fair to give a place a few chances before slamming them on yelp. Well, The Montauk fails in the food department. Fails spectacularly."}
{"text":"Great location with a nice vibe. The outdoor patio was cute and spacious with options to sit at tables or a sit up bar that goes into the restaurant. We heard live acoustic music going on inside. I ordered the jalapeno chicken sandwich and while it was really tasty, the piece of chicken was very small on a huge bun, so that was disappointing for a $12 price point. The waitress was friendly (basic friendly, not overly welcoming or talkative by any means) when she was around but the problem was she was barely around. After someone else delivered our food, she never came back to check in. We had been done eating for awhile and still hadn't seen her in awhile so I had to flag her down to get the check. Even then, it sat there for a lengthy time with our payment waiting for her to pick it up again. We were there a lot longer than what we should have been. She was a pretty non-existent waitress...and people wonder why they don't get good tips?"}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers have said, atmosphere very unique for Arizona, Food 3.5 Stars, service was not great nor timely.  Waited 35 minutes for the truffle chips and tuna tartare to arrive.  The expo guy didnt know who's food it was, etc... everyone at the bar had the same issue.  \"Nope, that's not mine.....\"  After 3 months and a very busy spring / tourist season you would think the kinks would be worked out."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I came here once before shortly after they had opened, and remember it being just fine for Happy Hour. Nothing really stood out, but like I said...just fine. Recently wanted to check out a new HH place and since I hadn't been to The Montauk in awhile I made it my \"new\" place to try and I'm glad I did because I LOVED it. 

Seriously, The Montauk has a really good HH. $3 drafts, $4 wells, and $5 wines. And the food is really good! I was really surprised how big the portions were considering how low the prices are! They have about 10 things to choose from and nothing is more than about six bucks. I came with my mom and we each got a bowl of clam chowder ($3). I liked it because there was a really good amount of clams in it but wasn't too thick. We also got the burrata, rock shrimp, and chips w/french dip. We really could have done w/only two of these but we figured the portions were going to be small (they weren't), and why not try a lot when things are around $5 each? The fig & pistachio in the burrata was yummy & I really liked it combined with the arugula! The rock shrimp was served w/this sweet buttery sauce that was so good! We actually used some our our chips from the french dip (because there was so many of them!) to dip in it! Speaking of the french dip, it was delicious! It was actually kind of light and not too thick & onion-y like a lot of these dips tend to be.

Our waitress was attentive & nice. We came here on the earlier end of HH (around 4) & I wouldn't say it was packed, but there was still a pretty nice crowd for early in the day. I'm already planning on coming back soon for brunch (the menu looked good) & of course Happy Hour."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Service was fine.  Food was great!

This was my second time to Montauk.  I sat at the bar and had some appetizers with friends.  The bartender took our order relatively quickly, but seemed to busy to make time to get to know the 4 of us.  (Not a bad thing, we were all talking to each other anyhow)!

We all shared the house made potato chips, deviled eggs, and French fries.  All were pretty good, but the French fries in buffalo sauce was AMAZING. I most definitely recommend that.  The potato chips with house made ranch were good but after having the flavorful fries, they seemed, well, bland."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.  They do stop serving food around 10pm on weekends.  Great relaxing interior with good sized bar.  Open to outside when not overly hot. Good service."}
{"text":"I visited Scottsdale this weekend and being from the south I didn't expect much hospitality in a glitz and glamour place like this... but boy was I wrong! Our waitress Mariah was so attentive! She recommended some great items on the menu (the prime rib breakfast sandwich and the berry filled crepes)   She often came back and checked on our table, even stopping to talk with us for a while because she liked our Tennessee accents. 
The place was packed but the staff handled it well. Even people who were not our server checked on us and asked if we needed anything and cleared our table. 
I will definitely come back to this place whenever I visit Scottsdale  (don't say Phoenix in this part of town)"}
{"text":"I contemplated whether to give the restaurant a 2 star or 3 star review. The sandwich is the deciding factor. I could have ate 2 more (seriously), it was more than memorable! The watermelon mule tasted fresh and refreshing! I just cannot move past the desperation of every mid 40 year old divorcé with lip injections and flip flops. The place reeks of Michael Kors clearance."}
{"text":"Shanna makes my experience here great each time, the food alone is amazing but a good smile and attitude behind the bar is everything. I've had her cocktails by the pool and at Montauk and consistency is huge for a classic cocktail each time. I'm super particular about my old fashions and this is one of 5 establishments in Old Town where I know I can trust any staff can make a a quality cocktail. Just Keep her behind the bar and I guarantee customers will leave reviews like this one  Plus the Crispy Rock Shrimp  and Tuna Tartare Guacamole  are to die for"}
{"text":"Great patio, especially at night in the fall. I had the prime rib sandwich. It was delicious! The waiter was fantastic. We hard a group of six ladies and he offered to take our picture out front after our dinner which went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a refreshing drink & a delicious tuna tartare guacamole appetizer in comfortable outdoor seating with cooling misters. Very friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  Super friendly service as well.  I am an interior designer, and  I absolutely love the design of the space, it feels so homey and current.  I would give it five stars, but the bathroom was a little disappointing.  It was really dark because there were two lights out... and when turning the faucet handle it came off in my hand.  I got it to work and it sprayed all over me... the sinks would look a thousand times better under-mounted.  I will definitely be back, hopefully to find some adjustments to the bathroom fixtures :)"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and good food. Menu isn't huge and consists mostly of food you'd find on a lunch menu. Our best selection was the guacamole tuna tartare as a starter. Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant for brunch but super sad they don't offer Benedicts anymore. The lobster Benny was the best one I've had."}
{"text":"I love Montauk! I'm from New York and walking in makes me feel like I'm right at home. I mean there isn't a beach, but it will make you feel like you are at one. Morgan and Mikey will forever be my favorite server duo! Best service, understanding of the full menu, anything our huge group needed we got right away. I even ordered an old menu item, and they honored it for me. I have been coming here since they opened, and a few things have changed! Yet the two duo hasn't changed. If that isn't a reason to come to Montauk, Besides the Haystack fries and flavored mimosas, I don't know what is. Some servers in the past haven't been as inattentive and the few servers I enjoyed have moved on to bigger and better things. Being a Newyorker you get to know your favorite restaurants and best servers. So I'm finally writing a review, about my favorite sunday brunch spot! Yet it is on the pricey side, thats why we love going in big groups, buy lots of apps and the PUNCH BOWLS are everything. My close friend can only have certain food groups so they got her anything that would help with her diet! Im so grateful to feel a little at home here. 

See ya next week for my birthday! like always walk in with four girls, leave with a huge group. thank you for being so accommodating and friendly. Cheers to another year!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible, the wait for food was over an hour and a half. We were sat with no silverware and had to get our own. I asked the hostess to send our server over 3 times. The restaurant was empty and the food took forever still. We ordered food vegetarian and came out with bacon mixed in. The drinks even took 20-30 minutes to get. Horrible. Don't go when there's so many better places in town."}
{"text":"Came in with a few friends on Friday. Such a fun lively spot the music was upbeat and the bar was busy. We got a table outside and Christina was our server! She killed it! Made awesome suggestions on drinks and food. The tuna guac is to die for and the cherry whiskey smash is heaven if you live jamoson. Great place to start your weekend off!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place for the atmosphere, the ever changing menu with delicious choices and their lobster roll!   Lobster roll is the bomb either hot or cold and kale side salad is yummy!"}
{"text":"Great lobster roll.  The tuna and guacamole is excellent fresh plentiful and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I really want to love The Montauk, cute atmosphere, fun drinks and great vibe. But the service really needs work. Service today was so slow, bar tenders couldn't get drinks right. Our waitress was so nice, but to get the table cleaned and water was the longest I have ever seen. Please take the time to do better service. I want to love you and spend money here but it so hard to. Make the Montauk as great as the real Montauk in New York, please stop disgracing the name."}
{"text":"This restaurant is new, but it's already my favorite place in Scottsdale. The service and atmosphere are just great. Really fun, friendly, happy people.

I hope they can keep up the quality of food/service over the years.

Good food, fair pricing, and a gorgeous buildout. If you are looking to have a good time in Old Town Scottsdale, go here."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 2/5
Happiness - 4/5

When dealing with restaurants, food - to me - always outweighs the style and decor of a place. And while The Montauk is heavy on the latter, it is a bit lacking in the former. 

Don't get me wrong, the food is fine, but was not notable in any way. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it didn't honestly have a taste beyond, well, chicken. The cheese was very akin to deli slices and didn't add much to it. The fries on the side were also fine but forgettable.

The decor is great though. They have expertly designed the place (and especially the balcony) to resemble a New England-style upper-scale restaurant. I got a real beach vibe despite being steps from super-congested Scottsdale Road. The staff was friendly and accommodating, though the service itself is generally slow. 

They do a special crepe brunch on Sunday afternoon and fried chicken on Sunday nights. I am definitely willing to give either a chance given the uniqueness of the meal options and my genuine enjoyment of the atmosphere. Stay tuned for potential updates!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good.  Specialty drinks were soso.  Inside the music was too loud but okay if your sitting outside."}
{"text":"Food was average. I had the mac and cheese and lobster roll. Ambiance was lovely. Cocktails were good!"}
{"text":"What an inviting atmosphere I must say!  I kinda felt like I was in California.  It reminded me of a place in Hollywood where you would be day drinking with dancing and craziness and punchbowls of ETOH.  
Ahhhh too thirsty in this AZ heat!  Must drink water!  Two of us ordered one of their fruity teas and 2 ordered cocktails.  I wasn't a huge fan of the tea.  I felt like I wanted to put in tablespoonfuls of sugar to cover that bitterness, but went with one sugar packet.  
We did share a moundful of haystack fries drizzled with buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese.  The portion size really was amazing! - couldn't finish it amongst 4 hungry ladies.  The fries were all nice and crispy though!  
Then I ordered the basic avocado toast $8:  smashed avocado on grilled bread with a fried egg and a side of fruit.  Additional $3 for bacon.  I thought that the 1-inch grilled bread was way too big for the amount of smashed avocado.  I could barely taste the avocado!  I wish there was a moundful of avocado.  I liked the egg on there, which actually came out more like sunny side up vs fried.  No biggie.  I had a plentiful mound of bacon!  But still wished for more avocado.  The fruit was ripe, fresh, and refreshing.  Overall, I think I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food.  I'll have to try something else on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Sometimes I think there is no middle ground in Old Town between hole-in-the-wall-dive and rave-til-you-puke. Happily, I think The Montauk has achieved this balanced nirvana! Bungalow was fun and fine for game day, but The Montauk is such an upgrade! 

I've been here twice now--once for just drinks out on their back patio, and once for dinner on the front patio this past weekend. Our evening here was the perfect kickoff for my bachelorette party weekend!

It's the perfect mix of casual, breezy and fun. (The beach-house aesthetic is on point.) After waiting a few minutes for an outdoor table and grabbing some drinks, we perused the menu. I went with the chicken kabobs, which come with a kale salad and fries. The best of both worlds!! Last year I started eating meat after almost 11 years of vegetarianism, and seafood is one of the foods I still generally side-eye. I tried a bite of my friend's fish taco and it was DELICIOUS! I can see why people rave. 

Our server was friendly and cute and after dinner my friends and I had an impromptu dance party in the bathroom. Success!"}
{"text":"Service was timely and excellent and we got some great nightlife recommendations as outsiders unfamiliar with the area. I had the lobster roll with kale salad, which I found a little overpriced ($15 maybe too much for the quantity) but the rock shrimp appetizer was the best shrimp I've ever had. Not too crowded for a Thursday night."}
{"text":"The warm lobster roll was phenomenal & my husband had the prime rib sandwich. Great portions & great service. Liked the relaxed atmosphere and good music. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to eat at Montauk only because the place across the street had a long wait for brunch.  I hadn't been here since it opened so I wasn't a hard decision.  We ordered some drinks to start and I must say that they do have a great drink menu.  The setup inside is almost the exact same setup that Bungalow had when they had the establishment.  I would have thought for a new place to open they would at least change up the look and feel of the place.  Not a big deal.  We put our name down for 4 with the hostess and she said it would be 20 minutes.  We walked in to the bar and noticed there were at least 4 open tables, but didn't pay any attention to it.  After about 20 minutes waiting at the bar I asked the hostess to give me an ETA and she said we were up next.  Still seeing the same 4 tables empty I thought hmm ok.  I walked back to the bar and the hostess walked up and said they had  table ready outside.  I said ok, but what about this one as I pointed to a booth right across from the bar.  She said ok you can sit there.  

Ordered the breakfast sandwich and deviled eggs.  Both great selections and they did not disappoint the taste buds.  Our waitress was on point and she didn't ignore us at all throughout our meal.

I don't think I'll be back here unless I find myself meeting friends."}
{"text":"Jess and the bearded man were the best. Great lobster wedge salad, but little bit heavy on the mayo. Loud fun music and good drinx"}
{"text":"Tuna guacamole, chips with French onion dipping sauce, lobster roll are amazing. Very fun atmosphere for brunch on sundays or happy hours any day of the week"}
{"text":"Amazing vibe and even better crew! Ask for the sangria with the Jack from Nate the Great ;) mention #j'hearme"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for the weekend, my friends brought me here for before watching a spring training game. Our server was super sweet, it was her first week on the job and she was really attentive and helpful. The cocktails and food were delicious, The DJ was playing hip tunes, and the decor is very stylishly modern. I don't understand the negative reviews; this is one of the better places I've tried out here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is here...the eggs by far were the best, even with an oily film across the top of them. I ordered the rib eye tacos...bland and boring. My husband had the chicken sandwich... totally overcooked. And the worst was his Mac and Cheese....tasted like it came out of a box.

The whole environment was confusing, extremely loud music and all the female wait staff wore clothes so tight and low cut I felt like I was in a strip club. And to top it off the staff presented an aloof and entitled attitude.

Not an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I've written a review a couple months back but I have to write an other review because this place gets better and better. This team is awesome from the ground up. I am never disappointed when I come here. I refer everyone new to old town to experience this amazing service."}
{"text":"Breakfast is simply yet Decadent! They have a guy playing guitar and singing who is very talented! Our waitress was also amazing all around a really wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good. However, the kicker for me was ordering a $10 glass of wine, being charged $15, bringing up the incorrect price to the server and when she comes back from talking with management tells me \"sorry, I'm new, that's the price\". I have worked in customer service for a long time and service specifically, I have never had someone offer so little explanation for a price discrepancy and then tell me to pay for their mistake. I went from ordering one of the more moderately priced glasses on the menu to buying the the most expensive, the highest priced glass on the physical menu was $14. I work in the area and would have loved to go back but this terrible experience was infuriating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Came here for the restaurant week special and had an amazing dinner. 

Really like the bar area and would be a great place to hang out and pre-game before heading out to Old Town Bar Strip. 

Heads up on parking; you'll likely have to valet your car and they only accept cash, make sure you come with a $20 which should cover your night. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fresh & yummy food. Only dislike is weekends have a brunch only menu with very limited lunch options. Brunch lasts until 3 pm. Bloody Mary's are great! Dj music a bit loud. You have to yell to people at your table. Great beachy feel."}
{"text":"It wasn't a particularly busy lunch crowd, but I was disappointed by the service here--asked for a sandwich with no bun and it came with a bun. Waters weren't refilled once throughout the meal. Didn't have silverware and had to snag it from the table next to us. Asked for two separate checks and received one. I'm not one to complain vocally or be anything less than polite and cheery during a dining experience, so I hope this review helps staffing get in order! The cauliflower \"rice\" was pretty satisfying."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are amazing! My boyfriend and I came twice this past weekend. We are from Las Vegas and we're in town for Spring Training. We came once Saturday morning for a drink. We had the mimosas, great! The porch was perfect for the Scottsdale weather. The bubbly blonde working the patio was very friendly. 

We came back today to actually eat. I had the prime rib sandwich and my boyfriend had the lobster roll. Both SO good!!! 

My only complaint was the bar tenders today (there were 4 working), 3 seemed so unhappy and like they hated their job. Anytime we asked for another drink we got a death stare and got the feeling we were being irritating to them...the one male today back there seemed great. The 3 girls (2 blondes & 1 older woman) never asked how we were doing or if we wanted refills. They never smiled and seemed irritated when we asked for another cocktail. 

Overall amazing food and GREAT environment but the attitudes bring it down."}
{"text":"Chris and Morgan are amazing!!!!  Great music and atmosphere.  Must try the fries The decor and scene has great vibes"}
{"text":"Where do I begin.. my friend and I were exploring Scottsdale and decided to pop in here. We waited almost 10 minutes to be greeted by anyone. The drinks and appetizers were brought out quickly and were actually really good! Our server went on break and sat across the bar from us and began feeding fries to other servers with her legs up and open from across the bar. We were a little shocked by this, but maybe this is normal here? We asked for a little more bread with our hummus and waited so long we asked for our check before It came. We then paid and was then brought out our bread as we were leaving. They also charged us for this. Great looking place inside, but wish the service was better. Has some great potential. Would not recommend and would not come back."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend who was visiting me from Pennsylvania and her and I needed brunch after a long Vegas weekend, we were very impressed and the prices are so great considering some places in old town are more than pricey. The bloody Mary's were perfect and I am usually not a fan, overall great service. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for dinner and it was packed at the bar. I ordered a skinny margarita and it wasn't good. I loved the warm lobster roll and would definitely get that again."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere! The food was so-so but the live music, sweet servers and yummy cocktails were exactly what I was looking for! Such a cool spot. I will definitely return for drinks and tunes!"}
{"text":"First time there and it was amazing! My waiter, morgan helped me decide on fish tacos, they were great! Wonderful service and food, one of my new favorites"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Scottsdale from San Diego, and the Montauk has been my favorite go to spot!  The staff are friendly, service is quick, they have several drink options and everything that I've eaten has been amazing!

Kelly has been my server a few times and she's great.  The first time that she served me she highly recommended the Brussels and those were delicious!  A few weeks ago I had brunch here for the first time and they have an excellent brunch menu.  I shared the burrata cheese and had the avocado toast and a side of potatoes.  It was the first time that I've ever had an egg on avocado toast and it was superb!

I like the crowd here.  You find a lot of professional people in their 30's that are dressed nice and not in the condition that you find at several places not too far away.

They have lots of seating indoor, outdoor and at the bar.  They also have lots of misters outside, which you definitely need in AZ.

I have friends coming to visit me in a few weekends and I'm looking forward to our first stop to be here.  I know that they'll love it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"A friend and I flew in to Scottsdale for a night out and found this place in the heart of the city. Christina was absolutely amazing with all aspects of her service. She honestly made us feel at home.

Really recommend the tuna tartare guacamole and the burrata.

We will definitely be coming back the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"drinks good. food ok. was here sunday evening - many beautiful girls and dumb guys. it was funny people watching. good service and good pours"}
{"text":"Mac in cheese and hamburgers are my favorite. Chelsea is my waitress. She remembers my birthday, my order , gives me hair advice , turns my day around and is the best waitress I have ever had the honor of being waited on by. My food as came out wrong 1 time Chelsea was so sorry and my new dish came out fast and warm. Chelsea is why this place gets a 5 star all day long and why I return with more friends/family weekly.  If you go there call ahead and make sure she's working. Then request her. she will make you feel like royalty 

I have came at night for dinner and drinks. I promised myself I would never come here again for dinner. The food was terrible and the service was bad. Just because I was there on a friend night with older people the manager was less concern with get our food out warm and more concern with the pretty blondes drinking at the bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this place!! I love the setting! In The area I sat it kind of gave me a cool beach summer vibe like bestie boys! I actually have wanted to go back since the minute I left! Literally they did 10/10 at making this place all their own truly. They went for their own theme and rly not many restaurants can hit that spot on but they did."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, the atmosphere not so much. We were seated at a couch and end tables for dinner and the music was so loud I couldn't hear the person sitting next to me. But... the food was great! I tried the shrimp rice bowl and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great service! Their food and drink menu go hand in hand. A must try is the tuna guacamole, it just works. Great for brunch, but can be crowded on the weekends. One of my favorite places to bring friends when visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent service! Came here for a late lunch on Wednesday. Ordered the fish tacos and waited quite a long time for the food. It was easily over 20 minutes and the restaurant was not full, in fact, there were only about 10 of us there. I wasn't starving so I did not mind waiting and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. After my food came, the manager walked over and apologized for the long wait and said he was comping the entire meal bc he was so sorry about the long wait! Amazing and so nice! The waitress was lovely and sweet, as well. 

The food in all honesty was just ok. I've definitely had better fish tacos and Mac and cheese. I prefer fish that is grilled, rather than fried in my tacos. I had a drink called the Endless Summer, which was nice. I was just visiting in Phoenix but in the future I would definitely return to the Montauk to try other dishes and because the service was so excellent."}
{"text":"Okay, I really can't decide how I feel about this place. To start the environment is top notch! It's a great place to take out of town guests because the environment is so nice. The mimosas are excellent but the food is below average. I got a breakfast sandwich and wasn't completely thrilled but I will give this place another shot!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, decent food, not worth the money, tons of great food in Scottsdale just move on too the next place. 

Ps. their drinks suck too"}
{"text":"Super excited to see the reinvention of the Bungalow. Always love a new place in Old Town. Atmosphere was pleasant and it's a great place to go if you have a ton of work to do and need to wait for your drink. A little disappointed since all of my work was done and the drink was the first thing on my mind. LOVE the concept of the oversized ice cube...however, the whole displacement concept somehow gets thrown off so it's like you get half the drink. (Like I said, work was done.) Switched to a wine ..this time service was prompt, but unfortunately the wine had turned and so our response was CHECK PLEASE! I'm now happily sitting at AZ88. 2 stars because the eye candy wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Poor service and it was not even busy. They have small menu (which you think that will be fast service). We came for breakfast we order 2 crapes and waiting an hour, they finally brought us one and it was raw and had no flavor. We had to walk out. The worst breakfast experience. Now I see why across the street it's packed and this place is half empty."}
{"text":"Great casual hangout with a Nantucket kind of feel to it. Excellent happy hour beverage prices and a nice selection of happy hour food as well. A go to place in the area"}
{"text":"Cool spot (design wise), great location.  Nice drinks as well.  Food below average and service from bar terrible. I have been at least 4 times and it has never gotten better. Wont go back again.

I would revamp the menu and fire the entire staff.  Start over. Seriously."}
{"text":"Warning: no sourdough!!! Great place for breakfast. A little loud but the perfectly crispy bacon makes up for it. The lobster benedict is great if you're very hungry, the regular egg, bacon, and toast breakfast is good for a regular sized portion."}
{"text":"This place was chaotic. It was so loud. Service was terrible. Out of every beer on a Saturday. Families don't go."}
{"text":"Dave and Mitchell were the best servers we could have asked for. Dave is prison hot. Best service we had while visiting Scottsdale. Ask for them when you come here!"}
{"text":"Sat down and waited at our table for 30 minutes and a waitress still hadn't served us or asked for our order or got us drinks. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. And the service was excellent. Went for lunch and was disappointed in the kale salad with chicken. The kale was not wilted enough and was extremely difficult to chew. The chicken, on the other hand, was almost as if it had been boiled and was kind of limp and tasteless. I am giving them 3 stars because the place was packed and there were many apparently happy customers. I will have to go back and give the food a second try."}
{"text":"Interesting nautical theme, not a fan of the awkward seating/Table arrangements. From time to time the waitress mix up/ or forget our drinks (but it was a large party) The menu was simple and to the point, their Mac N Cheese is absolutely amazinggg, along with the Shrimp appetizer. So delicious, and the waitress recommended a grapefruit type of drink that was perfect. The only thing I'd complain about is the Menu, because dessert wasn't anywhere to be found, I had to ask the waitress. Wish there was at least a separate menu with the choices available. Great place to go with friends for a decent priced bite to each and drink."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were in town for lunch. I got the cauliflower rice with chicken is was great! The service was also wonderful! We sat at one of the tables outside. I recommend trying his place!"}
{"text":"So when we first saw this place I have to admit that I didn't think much of it, thought it was just another place in old Town that would disappear in a few months. So glad to see and hope that I was wrong. From the food to the coffee it was surprising good.  First place that I have been to offer right off the bat Cold brew coffee, and in this AZ heat you need it. Out Server Tyler was varry attenive but not I  the annoying way, we was friendly and saw to out every need.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who was looking g for a good brunch place."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party brunch!! Had a great time, food was delish, and our server was polite. We also ordered a punch bowl, while it was fun (super huge) it barely had any alcohol in it! Wouldn't recommend the punch bowl for the price. But overall a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"this place is the greatest! when you come ask for Molly she is the nicest, prettiest and funnest woman. she was SUPER accommodating and just all around lovely! thanks for being awesome Montauk! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service from Jordan! I would recommend The Montauk to anyone in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"There was a nasty gray hair in our burger. It was long enough to floss your teeth with. The waitress was kind enough to ask if we wanted a new burger. Smh."}
{"text":"The warm lobster roll!!! The end. It's amazing. The decor is so fun very beachy, very montsuk, nicely done. The service was great Christina took care of us in sofa area. Very confortable, she made us feel at home very funny and nice. Felt like I had been friends with her for years. Great spot coming back soon."}
{"text":"Great food and a cool summer ambience. A perfect place for an evening drink with friends. Be careful of the drink special though.  Had to drive my friend home after a few too many of those."}
{"text":"This place has great energy and is so inviting.  Morgan is the best server!!!  He is an absolute joy and made this experience so meaningful!  Ask for Morgan he's the best ;)"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. They have misters on the patio so you aren't miserable from the heat. Our server was awesome, we got two bottles of champagne with pineapple juice and OJ for $60. The breakfast burrito was huge AND came with fruit and potatoes. It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"The vibes were so good here - like Miami pool-side lounging. Mostly thanks to the DJ!

Drinks and food were pretty freakin good, nothing super memorable, but the entire restaurant was definitely memorable. Loved the decor; actually felt like being in The Hamptons or Montauk (in addition to Miami). 

The best part though, was the DJ, namelessnoise. Everything he played was perfect. It was varied as well - some Spanish mixed in, down tempo, hip hop. I was obsessed.

Upon receipt of receipts, we got postcards, which was adorable since all of us were from out of town.

Note, this was also the perfect brunch spot for the bachelorette party I was attending. Perfect for day drinking. 

If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be a frequent visitor!"}
{"text":"Have been twice for brunch and both times have been amazing! We went this Sunday to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. They only take a few reservations on Sunday's according to the person I called and talked to. Luckily I was able to make one for 15 people without issue. We got there at 10 (right before the real rush of brunch), we ordered drinks (definitely recommend the mimosas with guava juice) and food (avocado toast was delicious as were the breakfast sandwiches with potatoes). We kept commenting on the kitschy decor/knick knacks and great live music (Garth Brooks to Ed Sheeran, and he takes requests).

Every single person in our party had their orders brought out quickly and correctly (usually a rarity with a group this large)! Our server was fantastic, friendly, and efficient. She took our credit cards at the beginning of our orders so when it was time to pay there was no confusion. We were in and out within an hour and a half. 

Boyfriend had a fantastic birthday and everyone in party said they can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot in old town! Staff, managers, owners all care so much about the venue and you can tell! Definitely one place I hit when I'm in town. Good for brunch and dinner, as well as late night drinks!"}
{"text":"Had the Mac n cheese and it was amazing!! Christina was waiting on us and give such good recommendations on beers and food!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite places. I've been in a few different times now and it was fabulous every time! The Bloody Mary was so spicy delicious! A great stop to come in with friends and enjoy a glass of wine and great ambiance. Only complaint I have is that my server had a weird response when I asked if I could sub arugula in the grapefruit salad. He said \"ehhh you might be asking for too much there because arugula is more expensive than mixed greens\".... I've never heard of that before, but umm okay? I wasn't gonna say anything about how I thought it was a weird response, but my friends even brought it up how odd the conversation was after he left. I'm in the industry as well and I would have got an earful from my manager if he knew I told a customer that. It was pretty awkward, but I still love the place nonetheless. 

I would have given this place 5 starts if it wasn't for that."}
{"text":"I'm not coming back here. We were a group of 4, ordered 4 different drinks, and no one finished their drink. They were gross. It's  total meat market with bad food - there is no reason I would come back here. I give it 2 stars because our server was nice."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere because it's owned by nightclub guys. However the food is really average.

Super hot girls working there though and decent $5 drinks for happy hour.

The $18 lobster roll was a joke. Maybe 2 tablespoons of chopped up lobster.

The cauliflower rice was actually decent but the chicken on top was flavorless and tasted boiled.

Come for the drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and food when this placed first opened. It was a nice respite in a sea of Denver omelettes and cheeseburgers on this stretch of Scottsdale road. Took my parents in for brunch around 10:30 on a Saturday, it seemed chill enough until the DJ came on and bottles start flowing out to multiple tables. My poor father & mother were great sports and didn't admit how annoyed they were we now had to shout across the table to have a conversation. I'm absolutely all for day drinking/day clubbing but at 11am for a place that supposedly takes pride in their food I expected a restaurant not a bar. To add insult to injury 3 dudes that rolled in 15 minutes after us (and we're spending $ on alcohol) got their food BEFORE us - we had 4 simple plates no substitutions - it was obvious management did not care for our business because we only purchased 1 drink and don't mind practicing blatant age discrimination. Well, message received guys! Will never be stepping foot in here again. Shame, because your chef seems to really know what he is doing."}
{"text":"great food and location...the service is mediocre. I've tried several items on the menu but always go back to my old faithful lobster roll. Sit on the patio. this place gets busy and loud so prepare yourself for that."}
{"text":"Yum! Went for lunch and atmosphere is great. Indoor/outdoor experience with all the light and open windows/doors. Food was fabulous. I highly recommend the burrata appetizer, kale salad and the cauliflower chicken fried rice!"}
{"text":"When I walked into the Montauk I got an incredible vibe from the beautiful atmosphere. It is a very well designed and inviting place. However both times I dined here, once our party was seated, the experience took a turn for the worst.  The servers we had despite being kind, were inexperienced, timid, slow, inefficient and altogether simply poor. The food will come out late, cold, and incorrect. 

When and what to come here for:
-Drinks, if you are looking for a trendy place to have a drink, this is a solid spot to visit. 
-Food, I wouldn't waist my time. The food here is decent at best, as mentioned before, it takes hours to receive, and overall you just don't get what you paid for (unless of course you paid to be unhappy and dissatisfied). 

Altogether, the atmosphere here was really cool. It was its saving grace. If I had closed my eyes and gone through the whole experience again, I would have imagined a cheap dirty dive bar."}
{"text":"Pros: Great atmosphere, classy clientele, nice bartender
Cons: Entire lot is valet, like they don't make enough money? $20 Lobster Roll could barely satisfy an infant. Mac n' cheese left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks and Morgan our server was amazing! Highly recommend the Brussel sprout tacos!"}
{"text":"Service is HORRENDOUS!  Went for dinner.  They don't take reservations, was told the wait would be 20 minutes for a table.  Non issue.  Then, it began.  The hostess was put off by everything; God forbid this be her job!  We opted to sit on the patio while we waited for our table.  We sat, sat some more and finally after 30 minutes, we got our cocktail and don't see the waitress again.  No joke!  Mind you, the 20 minute window we were quoted has since expired for our table.  Waitress went MIA.  Wowed by the stellar service, we went to the bar to close as we no longer had desire to stay for dinner, to be told they couldn't help because we were seated in a service area.  Still no sign of the waitress, and still no seat for dinner after an hour wait.  Can we say fail?!"}
{"text":"This place is great for brunch or even to grab drinks with a friend. The atmosphere reminds me of the Hamptons and it has a great vibe. When i went here for brunch they had a singer live and playing the guitar which made for a nice ambience. The food is decent and then the drinks are great.  Definitely a hip, fun place to go to for brunch."}
{"text":"I love their food and always enjoy their happy hour. Interesting experience last night. My friend and I definitely believe that our waiter was intoxicated. Kept slurring his words and seemed he could not focus on one thing at all. Seemed like he may have been late to work but they should have asked him to just stay home."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to relax in Old Town. Great atmosphere, great food, and quality drinks. Joel, the Manager always makes sure everything is perfect. I love the Shrimp ceviche (wish they still served it in a coconut) and the fish tacos."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you're literally at the beach, come here. Sick decorations and deep house lounge music. Great food and drinks (get the drink with the flower in it, you eat the flower). It smells of truffle oil. They have lobster...where else in Scottsdale can you get lobster?? It's truly a Scottsdale gem."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try The Montauk since they opened and probably would have before now if it wasn't for some friends who gave them thumbs down. 

The Montauk is definitely more about the scene than the food. My wife and I both had the Prime Rib sandwich and it was good but not amazing. The waiter felt a little \"on the run\" - which is different than what we've experienced from other Old Town Scottsdale Restaurants. Everyone was friendly. The live music forced everyone to have to yell to be heard - the waiter couldn't even hear me when we were talking - it was very loud. If you are a young single looking for the Scottsdale scene Montauk is probably a good choice but if you are a married couple out on a date night happy to get a few moments away from the kids, might want to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for dinner. Our waitress took our order - we ordered drinks, an appetizer, two salads and two meals. She brought the drinks and 30 minutes later we still hadn't even received our appetizer. Some guy approached our table and said he would make sure we got our order soon but after twenty more minutes and no appetizer still we paid for our drinks and left. They were too busy waiting on a large party to bother with us so we didn't want to bother with them anymore."}
{"text":"I get that it is New Year's Day, so the lethargy of the staff is mildly excusable, but it would have been nice to see our waitress again between the ordering and check delivery.  The food was good but I feel that we should not have had to walk up to the bar (only to be ignored by three employees then chased back to the table by [I'm assuming a manager] to get service) to  get a lemon wedges and fresh pepper for the salad.  He did make it right but that should not have happened.  Guess this is why all these trendy scottsdale restaurants turn over so quickly."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California for New Years. The restaurant vibe is on point and the food was decent. But oh.my.gosh. the service was AWFUL! It took 15 minutes just to get a a drink, it took about 45 minutes to get our meals and they weren't even right. They did tell us they were short staffed, and we understood, but no one would take accountability for the mistakes. One server would offer a discount, the next server had no clue what was going on, one server entered the meals in wrong, one didn't enter the meals at all...absolutely no communication with staff. This place has potential but I think the best time to go is when you are just looking for a casual drink at the bar!"}
{"text":"Okay! It's Easter Sunday me and my sister decided to try something new! 
We came across Montauk okay amazing outside the weather is great and they said there was a wait to be seated 30 mins and 45 for food we said that's fine! We were hungry and wanted to try this place out! 
We didn't wait for the complete time which was greatness! Sat down, and a rude waitress took our drink orders and then when we saw it was more reasonable to get a bottle she said I'm not taking care of your table anymore someone else will be coming! It took about 10 mins before the other nice waitress come with the bottle of champagne! We needed some juices! They have a couple of options of juices for mixing! However what we asked for they didn't have! Epic fail! I was already irritated we are spending money and the service wasn't great! And I was feeling kinda discrimination coming our way since we were the only two dark skinned women in the whole restaurant! And I hate that feeling since we are spending the same amount of money as others! 
We asked to switch tables since the place kinda cleared up and wanted to sit and enjoy the weather then the hostess comes and tells us it's been reserved which is a bunch of nonsense it wasn't they gave it to a couple that just walked up and asked for it! 
Ordered brunch! Egg white scrambled but was mediocre! 
We were barley done with the food the lady comes asking if we are thru and we still have our folks in hand! And cleaning up our table trying to rush us! I am soo irritated! 
This is my first and last time dining here and will spread the word"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to go to this place when I was the bungalow and wanted to see what it was like after all of the changes... WOW. What an upgrade 
Really nice vibe and feel to the place. Kind of reminds me of a restaurant on the east coast... Bartender was great, made sure everything was perfect for us and was very attentive. Great for groups and family gatherings. Will be back again"}
{"text":"Slow afternoon and our waitress was no where to be found. Appetizer came 10 min before our drinks. Beer was warm. Maybe it was because the table of 6 next to us had to have their own tabs! Isn't there a rule about that??? Annoyed"}
{"text":"$3 reverse happy hour draft beer except Guinness you can't beat it Friday and Saturday 11 PM to 1 AM what the F nothing to think about. Great open atmosphere live DJ come check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great location. And awesome for lunch and day drinking. Bartenders are friendly and very attentive - which is a rarity in this town! Even the management staff is friendly and they'll come to your table and ask how your service is."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Scottsdale, hands down. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Great drinks and a good time. Highly recommend for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with some girlfriends!  Came here on a quiet Thursday, Kardi was especially fun and accommodating.  Great personality and so fun!  Service was great!  Loved the Tuna tartare and the rock shrimp.  Rock
Shrimp was probably our favorite.  Lobster roll was great too!  They offer both hot and cold and the flavor was delicious! Sit on side patio if you can the ambience there is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. The concept is great. However, ALL three times I've tried to give this place a chance, I've been told the kitchen is backed up and we should be prepared to wait 45 minutes for food. Most of the time the restaurant isn't even half to capacity."}
{"text":"Servers were great, food was spot on.....  crowd = meh.  If I wanted to hear about your makeup struggles in the booth next to me I'd ask..."}
{"text":"Not only did the gentleman at the door sit on his phone and not acknowledge that there was a line of people at the door, after waiting for quite a while no one came to the table. Upon leaving, we told the hostess and she could care less. This is unfortunate because the food looked good."}
{"text":"I wish they had a restaurant like this near me. We had Sunday brunch and it was great- the fries, burrata, salads, and breakfast sandwich were fantastic! Great service and the staff is super easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Here's the deal- I stopped in here for a drink with a friend, we did not end up eating, so I cannot comment on the food. My friend and I sat at the bar and immediately felt uncomfortable. The crowd here was definitely the older single crowd desperately trying to find someone. We were just looking to get a quality drink and hang out. The music was on very loud for a bar/restaurant, so loud we could barely talk. We each had a drink and both were mediocre at best. I had their pimm's cup, which was probably the worst Pimm's cup I've ever had. It lacked the refreshing and sweet quality that makes for a good pimm's. My friend had a gin and tonic with fruit... except it was all gin and one slice of fruit.... it was almost undrinkable. The scene and the drinks were not really my thing... I don't think I'd be back, especially not on a weekend night."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out so we came here for lunch on a Sunday. It was about a 20-30 minute wait for a table. We sat outside on their lovely patio listening to the live music that was playing. 

I ordered the watermelon mule to start. This was a very refreshing drink, but not very strong.Watermelon, ginger beer and vodka. I then ordered the Rose Sangria. Now this was delicious and definitely hit the spot. I ordered the burrata for my entree. This comes with grilled bread, prosciutto, fig, pistachio, roquette, and truffel oil. Also very delicious. 

I really liked this place. I love their outdoor patio and the atmosphere. I just thought that their brunch menu was pretty small and our waitress wasn't very talkative. I'd come back though."}
{"text":"I am torn about the Montauk. They introduced to me to my favorite drink (Cherry Whiskey Smash) and have an awesome location. The staff that works there is usually nice. It's as if it does not know what it is. Sometimes it is a lovely cafe/bar (not sure about the quality of the food -- never ate there). Sometimes it is an overly loud and crowded mixed-age party bar. When it gets crowded, it becomes unpleasant (and not just for the obvious reasons... hehe). I leave the final decision to you. It is clean and pretty nice. 
P.S. Oh, and before you get the Cherry Whiskey Smash, make sure they have the Luxardo Cherries in stock. Otherwise you pay a silly amount for a glorified mule."}
{"text":"Really loved the lobster roll and the beach atmosphere.  It was pretty busy and the service was a little slow, but well worth the wait.  The cocktails were great too.  I felt like I was in Nantucket or the Hamptons.  My friend got a hamburger and fries and she raved about it as well.  We will return."}
{"text":"They may have gotten 5!stars if it wasn't for Kardi our waitress who only cares about mingling and basically ignoring us for the most part. The waitress who had tables around us was kicking ass while Kardi was Mia. I would have spent more money as she never asked us if we wanted anything else or even another drink. She barely spoke to us after we ordered our food, and never said thank u or even much of a word to us. She SUCKS. She is lucky she even got a tip. I am sorry we weren't 20 and day drinkers but we spend money and honestly I am not sure I would come back or recommend this place again. Fire her if u know what's good for your businesses"}
{"text":"Attempted to come a number of times but it was either closing or too packed. Had a delicious drink once but this place doesn't wow me. Although every time I walk by it appears to be popular."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas, great service. Beach feel and a regular spot I come too. A must if you are in old town!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! The service is amazing and the food and drinks are great! We had Alec as our server and he was extremely attentive."}
{"text":"What a fun and lively place! Came here for brunch and was not disappointed!! I had an amazing egg and bacon crepe (comes with fresh fruit and potatoes) and a heavenly bloody Mary that besides the usual garnish also had a bacon strip! My friends loved their nutella and banana crepe and the smoked salmon benedicts!
Now on Sundays, there is live music so it is pretty loud!! I personally didn't mind up but some people might complain. I definitely want to come back and try their lobster roll for lunch!"}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying the review is higher because they make a cauliflower fried rice , it's amazing everything you would want from fried rice but no rice !!  Also had the tar tare guacamole it was delicious as well, lastly I had the warm lobster roll which was good , the only 2 things I didn't care for were the old lemon slice on the top, not appetizing at all and the second is the domain lettuce it was wilted and had to be removed the sandwich would have been better served with out the lettuce and with a fresh slice of lemon. The music is a little too loud for lunch hours too we could barely hear each other talk at times. All in all you gotta try it here it's a nice place with a great street view and some good food."}
{"text":"I went for a Saturday brunch and had Morgan as my server! He was so nice and attentive, would love him to be my server next time! Food and drinks were great also and the bartender Jamila rocks!"}
{"text":"This place is ! Service is super friendly! The lobster wedge salad is delicious... As well as the warm lobster roll. Get the kale salad as a side for a delicious light and satiating lunch."}
{"text":"Solid salmon crepe and bartender was cool that I talked to during breakfast."}
{"text":"Drinks are wonderful, food/menu is versatile and delicious, the customer service is also great. The atmosphere is actually why I come here though. So open and beachy. Makes you feel like you're in San Diego"}
{"text":"Nice brunch! My friend and I had the Lobster and smoked salmon Benedicts and we both loved it! Bloody Mary was good too, although I could barely taste alcohol...be aware that it's loud!! We wanted to seat outside but there wasn't room...I would come back but in a less busy day and definitely away from the noise!"}
{"text":"THE best brunch!! I had the berries and cream crepe and it was the best decision. Also, the Chandon mimosa choice is the best option because you get such a good deal! Really awesome service and great recommendations from Morgan! Cheers to him! Everyone come visit The Montauk for brunch ASAP and ask for Morgan, he's the best!!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a bite after glancing over the menu. Sounded like it would be a winner. The place had a great vibe. Lots of energy and young people drinking and eating. Our server, Max, is the only reason this place is worthy of any stars. He was attentive, personable, and timely. The food, well it was low-grade bar food. The ceviche was dry and flavorless, the prime rib sandwich was a step above McDonald's, and the cauliflower fried rice was bland with a mix of flavors that bordered on gross. Shame..."}
{"text":"I don't even know how I'm giving this place one star only because of the awful service and food the manager comped our entire meal! I was visiting from California me and my best friend were trying to decide where to go we wanted to go to Houston's but wanted to try something new as well and we decided on this place. We walk in and there's some solo guy singing country music which was very random on a Sunday day at 2 PM it was not that busy and took us about 15 minutes just to get seated. It took about another 15 minutes for somebody to come over and take our order and then we waited about 20 minutes for two drinks and no waters were brought over this entire time. Then we had ordered the shrimp after 45 minutes of waiting for an order of shrimp appetizer it came out ice cold. Then the waitress brought it back to the cook the cook clearly took the cold shrimp that was supposed to be hot and moved it on a hot plate and they brought that back out to us. Then the Mack and cheese appetizer we ordered came out cold and had bologna in it which was not listed on the appetizer menu. Then the french fries we ordered came out cold as well. We were there about 2 1/2 hours with three horrible appetizers and only one drink each between us the waitress was awful the food was awful the only way it ended well is because the manager comped our measly $50 meal. I will never go to this place again and would not recommend this place to anybody. Whoever cooks the food there should be fired!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed dinner and drinks here on a Friday evening. We ordered the potato chips with dip to start which were a great snack to have while we had our drinks. We then tried the fish tacos with kale salad and hamburger. The portions were good and the food tastes great! 

The music inside was very loud which made it feel like we were eating in a club and the servers at times took longer than normal to bring things that we requested. But overall it was a pleasant experience and I may come back for drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"Went here after the wait across the street went too long one morning. Food was great, Mac + cheese especially amazing. No wait. Fun live music. Can't complain. Will go again next time in town."}
{"text":"Everytime a new friend comes to town, this is our first stop. Thanks Morgan for a great MondayFunday!!"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best mac n' cheese I have ever had in my life. I usually sit at the bar for lunch and the staff is really friendly. I want to explore other items on the menu but the mac n' cheese is just too good to stray away from."}
{"text":"Had a great classic breakfast today.  I loved the breakfast potatoes and the eggs were done perfectly.  The fruit was fresh.  The bacon was soso a bit disappointing.  The toast was soso as well.  The service adequate and I enjoyed the atmosphere.  Very laid back and enjoyable.  I need to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going is its decor. I didn't choose this place based on the menu - was just meeting friends. So, I chose the only thing that sounded good...the \"bacon and egg crepe.\" Strangely it had what seemed like THREE WHOLE ONIONS in it and there was one egg on top of the crepe opposed to inside it? It was basically inedible. Honestly one of the worst menus I've seen and worst meals I've had at a Phoenix restaurant.  I also had a bite of my boyfriend's sandwich (some kind of rib eye breakfast sandwich) and it was tasteless. The service was also horrendous: our server was rude and the food and drinks took a ridiculous amount time.  I wouldn't go back to this place to eat if someone paid me."}
{"text":"One of the best bartenders we have found recently.  If you are looking for a specialty cocktail with a great laid back, beachy vibe The Montauk is your destination.  They also had a great menu available."}
{"text":"Horrible place, waited nearly 54 minutes to get my order. The food was plain and the excuse that I received was. There was a huge order ahead of my order. Mind you, the proper way could have been to \"communicate\" at least let me know that I'm going to wait for 54 freaking minutes to get my food but leaving me in the dark. Not cool. Make sure you look for another breakfast place than this place. 
Waitress was good, but not the place to enjoy"}
{"text":"I was there on May 11th for lunch after flying into Phoenix. My salad was so-so. I had the avocado and pink grapefruit with shrimp.

The shrimp tasted like they were grilled hours ago. And the greens was just a dense blob of greens with not much flavor. 

The salad was a large serving but I quickly lost interest.
My daughter's tacos were good."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was not. No wine list. Might come back next time. Nice cocktail list."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we came on an off night but tonight was our first time going(Saturday) and it's a place I would never recommend or come to. 
The vibe and decor was great ! But after being seated we had a waitress come 15 min after to ask if we wanted water, then never returned. 25 min into it then someone else came and took our order. Felt kind of like we were being ignored because we weren't with a big party. 
When our food and drinks finally arrived they were both just ok. My fiancée drink came with once ice cube left in it because it was probably sitting for so long. 
The waitress was very sweet but all in all not a good experience"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous brunch here! It was the perfect Saturday meal. Jordan our server was great and I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"My bf and I are from Portland, Oregon and he had just moved here for a job in Scottsdale. I was here visiting and we came for a beer after lunch. The ambience of this place seemed pretty cool and would seem super fun on the weekends. However, service makes all the difference at a restaurant/lounge. I love going to places that have a good atmosphere but ALSO great staff and welcoming service. This place however, did have only 1 of those 2. The service and customer service need some working on. They did not check up on us once while we were sitting at the bar. Also, the couple behind us waited for a while before getting seen by a waitress and it seemed they were all pow-wowing in the corner. Maybe it was the workers working that day. But All in all, that is why I give this place 3 stars but the ambience and food seems great."}
{"text":"First visit. Menu, food and service were good. However this is more bar than restaurant. Loud DJ music!  Maybe better for lunch if you want to be able to have a conversation. Parking situation tough in old Town Scottsdale too."}
{"text":"I am not really sure what to think of this place. I was left standing at the host stand for fifteen minutes with plenty of staff walking by me. It was weird. No one said hello or offered to help me. Not a great first impression. I sat on the patio for a while waiting for my friends. The patio is very pretty! When my friends came we were seated right away and the service improved greatly. In fact, the server was very good! 

So now onto the food. Well, here we go again. The items on the menu were not available yet. The sever said they wouldn't have some of the food until after their grand opening in two weeks. I had bad luck with ordering. All the things I wanted were not available yet. What I find strange is that they have been open for a few weeks now so this is unacceptable in my opinion. The charming and humorous waiter saved that, but still. 

The restaurant itself is pretty and has a nice layout. However, the restaurant claims to have a Long Island theme as the name and menu suggests but the bathroom has Flamingos on the wallpaper and the wall has a steer on it. lol. Maybe it is meant to be eclectic. 

I had the Prime Rib sandwich which was good. The salad with it was nothing special and the fries they served for us as a replacement to the sold out chips were just okay. They were not as good as the ones at other local places. 

Finally, the place plays very loud music. They did turn it down when we asked. I have to be honest and say I will be fair and go back and try it again. However, they will have to really impress me to consider going back a third time. I hope they iron out their opening kinks."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm writing this review is so whoever the unfortunate souls were who invested all their life savings into opening this place know what's really going on in their restaurant. 

First off, I LOVE this place. As far as the decor, the location, the feel of things, it's perfect. 

BUT, your staff is ruining your establishment. I work in the service industry so I know what is acceptable and what is not. 45 minute ticket times with absolutely no communication, no apology, no \"let me get you a cup of soup while you wait!\" At 40 minutes we politely asked where our food was and the bartender looks at us and says \"well I would check on it, but I know food takes a long time so...\" Are you kidding me?!? That is the most pathetic response I've ever heard. If that were my bartender she'd be fired on the spot. 
No one smiled. Not one employee had a smile on their face. Something has to change. Especially when it is season in Arizona and people from all over the country are coming to visit our beautiful state. Have some pride in where you work. 

Anyway, I would really love to see this place change around because it's potential is off the charts. Get some people who look like they want to be alive and well and maybe a few extra people in the kitchen. Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"Today would have been my second time eating at The Montauk. But that didnt end up happening.

Upon walking in, the hostess did not make eye contact and was completely rude. Im used to walking in and being greeted. \"Welcome to Montauk,\" nope, just \"how many?\" Kinda starting to get that vibe the more I come to Scottsdale.  She left to go clean off a table, and another hostess approached. No smile, eye contact, or nothin Jesus! After hostess #1 returned from cleaning the table she told hostess #2 \"its done.\" We were then walked to the table, our menus were placed on the table and off she walked. 

The waitress came and didnt say \"hello\" either. What the fuck? These girls here really need some training on hospitality and possibly manners. We asked for water to start, took about 5 mins to get that. THEN we ordered drinks from the bar, took 10 mins to come back with that. We left. You can keep your drinks and your shitty service. 

Ill give you 1star because I like the way the decor looks in here."}
{"text":"The Montauk is the only place on Sunday where you'll find great food & drinks, outstanding service and an exceptional atmosphere!!! I've been to all the other spots in old town and nothing compares.  

The minute  we were seated, we were treated like the only ones in the building. Joel was our server and he knew exactly what we wanted, when we wanted it! His energy was contagious and 7 bottles of champagne later, we were so glad we didn't go somewhere else. Joel refilled our juices and cleared our plates without us asking! Max came by our table to see how we were doing too. Amazing!!! 

We're 100% coming back next weekend for Sunday Funday !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and okay food. The DJ was so good, I am giving an extra star for him alone. He mixed old school rap with new stuff and his music was on point. The bar staff is good. A group of 7 of us came here for dinner and drinks. It took 30 minutes for the waiter to bring our drinks. I actually went to the bar and ordered a drink before my drink got to the table. They took a long time turning on the heaters and a girl from my group moved them herself. The appetizers were okay but we had no plates, silverware or napkins. The shrimp was the best out of all of them. I would recommend coming here for drinks but skip the poor dining experience. Yes, we complained to the manager and hopefully they figure it out."}
{"text":"I've been here for a few different occasions (brunch, happy hour and dinner).

Brunch is pretty good and they have a special drink menu with different flavored mimosas. They're really good but a little on the pricey side.

As for drinks and food for lunch/dinner, I'm a huge fan of the fish tacos. The fish is fried, but they always taste super fresh and have such good favors! For an appetizer or a side, I definitely recommend the buffalo fries. They're little shoe string fries with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese crumbles. Yum.

Overall, the service is ok, but it's the perfect spot to go for any kind of Occassion. Delicious drinks and fun and a fun atmosphere!"}
