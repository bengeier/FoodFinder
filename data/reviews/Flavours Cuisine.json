{"text":"I give them 5 stars if the price if the dishes were not so ridiculously small and over priced. It was very tasty and fresh tasting"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in today using an Entertainment Book coupon, have never been here before. I ordered Jollof Rice with beef and loved all the flavors in both the rice and beef. Sooo good, highly recommend this dish. Nice clean place, interesting atmosphere, lots of seating, and we liked how there were dividers in the room offering a bit of privacy. We'll be back :-)"}
