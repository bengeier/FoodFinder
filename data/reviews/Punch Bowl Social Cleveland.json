{"text":"First time here from out of town. I had an amazing time! Bowling, punch, and burgers! What more can a girl ask for? Service was speedy and super polite. I'll be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I had been here before for a company event, but score tonight,  I had never come specifically for dinner. We started with the humus. It was very tasty, but the hummus portion was not very large. Then we each had sandwiches. I had a burger and fries, and my friend had a Cuban with poutine.  The poutine was a little disappointing. It was not the same poutine you would expect from say Montreal, Canada, but an American facsimile.  It was fine, but, really... French fries gravy and cheese curds should taste fantastic!  The atmosphere is lively, which is what we expected. The food was fine, but not amazing.  Among the best and most unique menu items, were their adult milkshakes. Yum!  Wyou go,skip the poutine and use those calories on a milkshake."}
{"text":"Huge space close to the river. Friendly staff. I like the decor, mason jars for water glasses. Not a huge fan of biscuts and jams brought out for a dinner order instead of bread and oil but whatever. Deviled eggs were okay, kinda small, ok flavor but a little too much going on. Burger looked great, two thinner patties instead of the usual one thicker one. My street tacos were good. Decent place to come for casual fare. The cocktails were bad from the bar however. The social punch my friend ordered was way too strong and didn't taste anything like a punch at all. My Mule was not good, couldn't even tell it was supposed to be some kind of take on a Moscow Mule. Just very blah, like drinking vodka on the rocks with a splash of weak lemonade. Cocktails need some work."}
{"text":"wow.  huge festival going on around the corner- running on a limited menu, and a only reasonably full and it was 35 min wait. and our waitress hasn't checked back on us since she took our order."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food was nasty and the bartenders were completely rude and nasty as well; and the management was the same way. The way they treated the guest at the bar including myself , they should be out of business. TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Professional and courteous staff. Food was on point. Great place to bring a group of friends to eat; and then enjoy all of the entertainment."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and decent music. Bartenders are very slow and unresponsive. You can be standing waiting and they will ignore you."}
{"text":"The service here is awful, will never go back again. I've had several bad experiences here in the past with food and service, but decided to come for brunch with our wedding party the morning after our wedding. Only because it was the only spot in the flats who could accommodate such a large group (16). Some friends had brought cards to the brunch who hadn't brought them to the wedding the night before, and my fiance mistakenly left 2 of them on the table, along with our hotel key cards. My young step sister also left her kindle on the table (we left in a rush because service had taken so long). When we got home 20 minutes later we realized immediately that the cards and Kindle had been left so we called right away and the manager told us they did not have any cards or a Kindle, but they had our hotel key cards they would be happy to return! Seems very suspicious they would not find the two cards filled with money, but found and kept our old hotel key cards which were sitting underneath the wedding cards, as well as them never seeing a Kindle on the table. I've left items at restaurants many times before and have always retrieved them with no issue, sometimes days later.. but it blows my mind how all these items worth money just disappeared. Save yourself the trouble and so somewhere less trashy."}
{"text":"Cool place, things to do, a lot of people, decent drinks at reasonable prices, food is absolutely terrible, service is mediocre at best. We came here to get some drinks and food... I really wish we went somewhere else for food before we came here.  The burgers were way overcooked and did not taste good at all, nachos were all soggy, the cake was dry and stale, fries were good though.  I will come again, but never to eat."}
{"text":"Haley with the Cat Ears was such a great sever! Haley was super attentive and super nice! I will definitely be back to visit her."}
{"text":"Want a long wait for ice cold food? Punchbowl
Is the place for you!  Grab a table, order and then wait 45 minutes or so for cold food.  But don't worry - the unapologetic management will be by shorty to take care of it.  In another 30 minutes warmish food will be at the table.  Skip it,  too many better options.  Likely one will be replacing Punchbowl shortly."}
{"text":"Where do I start! Now keep in mind that this place is supposed to be the place to be or so it seemed when they first opened. So my girlfriend and I decided to give it a whirl expecting to be impressed.....wrong! We arrive, the greeters were very pleasant and we were seated. We sat down and a waitress (tall, sloppily built Caucasian woman, early 20's) came and introduced herself after about 10 minutes and seemed agitated. So it came time to order and I ordered a chicken sandwich and asked for a slice of cheese on the side and her response was \"I'll see what I can do\". So I asked why she would have to \"see, what she could do\" and her response was that the restaurant did not carry \"regular\" cheese and that I can get shredded cheddar cheese on my sandwich. So I asked her why can't I get and slice cheese that they put on their cheeseburgers and her response was \"oh ok I can do that\". So of course I was a little confused about the interaction but I brushed it off. So I then proceeded to order a blueberry lemonade or some flavor I do not remember and she informed me (after I asked) that there are no free refills on those particular drink and I accepted. So she then brought myself and my girlfriend our drinks (she had a sprite) and I realize that my lemonade was contained in (literally) about a 12 ounce jar looking cup which cost me $4.99 I believe. I then took a very small sip of the beverage and realized that the lemonade was extremely bitter so I flagged down our waitress and told her that I no longer wanted the lemonade and that I wanted to switch my choice of beverage and she told me that she could not take the lemonade off of the bill because I had already drank from it. I then immediately asked to speak to a manager and I watched her walk over and speak to a middle aged white man who did not immediately come and speak with me instead he walked past our table and did not come and speak to me for at least 7 or 8 minutes. When the manager finally spoke to me I told him of the situation about the drink and he told me that there would be no problem removing the drink from my bill and adding a normal fountain drink (which I then ordered root beer). Shortly after speaking with management our food arrived and we ate. I rate my food at a 5/10. The bread to my chicken sandwich seemed a bit stale, the chicken patty was small and bland but the fries were decent. Towards the end of our meal, both myself and my girlfriend was out of our respective drinks and our waitress deliberately brought my girlfriend a refill but neglected to bring me one. I then ordered desert. I ordered a slice of cheesecake and my girlfriend ordered chocolate caramel cake. Both slices were extremely cold as if they were being stored in a freezer of some sort and the quality of both slices was not fresh at all! With that being said, the restaurant part of the business sucked, the attitude of the waitress sucked which surprised me because she did not even attempt to be polite nor did she attempt to hide her bad attitude. It begs the question; who allows their employees at a so called tourist attraction to treat paying customers in that fashion. So like I said, the restaurant part was terrible but we did not get t experience the rest of the facility bowling, billiards, gaming, drinking, etc (which looked fun btw) bc we were so turned off by the terrible service. Also the menu was extremely limited with no diversity. If I am invited to a party there then I may give it another try but I definitely won't be there for dinner any time soon that's for sure."}
{"text":"Cool concept, but it gets uncomfortably crowded here on the weekends. It's basically a club WITHOUT a dance floor. Add a dance floor and I'll add a star to my review."}
{"text":"Eh. Alright space but the crowd sux! Staff for pool table rental was very nice. The prices we're through the roof! The high drink prices must be a ploy to get a better group of people. So instead of broke idiots starting fights and being ignorant you have idiots with money do the same thing. At least you'll make money. Place was beautiful and kool to check out but i doubt we'll go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great waitress, great food, great fun. I love that there are so many gluten free options AND that the bar area is so spacious."}
{"text":"Don't do it!  If you are thinking of getting together with colleagues this Christmas or anytime and want to do something fun DO NOT go to Punch Bowl Social.  We took a group of work people there lat Friday after calling a head to see if we need to make any special reservations after we were told no that it was not necessary we showed up for some fun.  We got there any there  were all kinds of parties booked.  Our party was slit up at 5:00 and we could not move between areas of the bar because some of it was reserved.  The staff were rude and would to accommodate us in any way even know we had a number of people and we have been there since 4:00.  They just did not care. 

Don't waste you time. The prices were high, staff were unprofessional and unhelpful.  Go someplace else.  Dave and Busters is better then Punch Bowl Social."}
{"text":"Cautiously optimistic is how I went into Punch Bowl Sunday morning after having just opened the previous day. All in all everything was great, maybe anything would have tasted good after a few drinks but I think in this case the food was just plain good.

From their brunch menu: the wings were sweet and spicy, cooked perfectly. The nachos were layered (as a part time nacho connoisseur this is rare to find) and even had cauliflower! Main meal was chicken and waffles which was a little heavy on the chipotle syrup but managed to combine sweet and savory components.

My only regret is I did not get to experience any of the games (arcade, darts, bowling, shuffleboard, etc.) Punch Bowl offers but will give me a reason to come back. And back I will come."}
{"text":"OMG - totally the right place to celebrate our friends birthday - first off ANISHA IS AMAZING, we had a huge group and she was super attentive and responsive to our whole party- second, Kevin and his glorious beard made sure that we were checked on often- third, the food was good and came out quickly despite how busy it was!  Will definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Over powered bouncers ruined this place unfortunately. Forget about getting a drink in a timely manner. There are no multitasking skills with these folks. One very rude and ignorant hired hand refused to allow my gf back to the roof bar area after a bathroom break. He was very insolent and condescending. The manager was decent but the bridge was already burnt. 

In no way, shape or form will we back to this place. I grew up in the old flats as a boater. Rumrunners, Hooters, Fagans, etc. This is the type of place that could tank the flats again. Fight city/ drowning USA is how it ended before. Careful. History repeats itself."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun! Between the drinks, games and bowling you will have a great time. I stopped in here with a large group (around 30) on a Thursday night, so we basically filled the place. We had lots of drinks, a few snacks and overall great time."}
{"text":"I think we need one of these in Nashville! Stopped by here Saturday, 1/2/16, and WOW!  The place is spacious, was SUPER crowded, and it was plenty to do and see.  My friend and I ordered drinks, chatted a little, and did some people watching.  It was enjoyable, just VERY VERY CROWDED!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Never got napkins after we ordered apps. Had to ask for napkins.  Received cocktail napkins thrown at us.  Requested to order food finally from the regular menu and never had a waiter come back in time.  Offered the after hours menu at that point which was never expressed to us prior.  It took forever to just get a server in the first place."}
{"text":"I spent some time recently at Punch Bowl Social for a private event. The food options were setup in a buffet style and were constantly replenished. I eat Gluten Free, so I appreciated the signs accompanying each dish letting me know if an item was gluten free or vegan (the menu is also setup this way). My options for the night were limited to vegetables, antipasto,  chips and salsa, so I won't comment on the food quality. The service for drinks was attentive and very friendly. As for the games, I somehow expected there to be more. There are at least 6 full size bowling lanes, a shuffleboard area, darts, and ping pong (go upstairs). There is a 4 player pac man table, 1 skee ball, 3 pinball machines, 1 foosball, 1 shooting game, 1 driving game, and maybe 4 other single player old school type video games (donkey kong, pac man, etc). Each game is $1 per play, so be sure to bring cash (they do have a quarter machine if you need change and the shooting game accepted credit cards).  But the arcade is sort of shoved into this small area the size of a living room and after 30 minutes and $10, my friend and I were done playing (the bowling lanes were all taken and people looked like they weren't leaving their spots any time soon). You can't beat the location though. Punch Bowl takes up quite a lot of real estate on the east bank of the flats right on the boardwalk by the water. Their patios at gorgeous and wrap around the building, a great place to sit back and enjoy the city at night. Valet parking is located right in front ($20) and there are self parking spaces and parking lots across from the restaurant."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE DURING \"BRUNCH\" HOURS! They are incredibly under staffed and the D team they did have on couldn't handle how slow they were. Our waitress was terrible. We had a party of 5 for a baby shower and they crammed us all in a booth. She randomly took our drink/food orders and everything came out at different times. My friend wanted a togo order and the server said she would put it in later. After waiting almost 30 min for our food the togo order came out first and our regular food didn't come out until 15 min after that. We clearly heard the server tell the kitchen guy she put in the order wrong but blamed it on them for making the togo order first. All of our food was cold and mediocre. My friend didn't even get hers because the order was messed up and we were told it would take another 20 min for her to get her food! Then the server had the togo order put in the heating window in the back like that was a reasonable solution. I've worked in restaurants and after food sits in a carry out container for 15 min it gets really gross. The \"training manager\" Kevin came over and clearly needs a lesson in customer service. He offered to remake the togo order which was the right thing to do but when my friend was pissed about not getting her food and didn't want anything else he had no idea how to handle it. Not everything is going to be perfect and he clearly was cracking under pressure and even got rude and defensive. He even knocked a bottle over on our table because he was so flustered. To top it all off, the waitress who blamed everyone else for messing up was talking crap about him to us? AND the GM Dennis let this all go down without coming over and saying a word. Instead he tried to stare us down as we walked out the door because he clearly thinks he is some mafia major club owner from LA. What a horrible experience! Out of all the restaurant managers I know and people I've worked with I've never seen a GM who would act like that or let that happen. Unbelievable. My friend was looking into having their corporate Christmas party there too but definitely decided against it. That place has so much potential. Maybe it is different during dinner hours? Who knows, we will never return."}
{"text":"Cool place. Huge. Bowling. Nice bar. Shuffleboard. Arcade. But very,very limited menu. Food was good. Reasonably priced. Staff friendly and tried to please, but got one order wrong, forgot drinks, etc. it was ok. Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"I was at Punch Bowl last night for the first time when visiting Cleveland from Columbus. When going upstairs, Veronica welcomed my friends and I. She also offered to get us drinks and helped find my friend's lost wallet. Veronica's kind and compassionate personality made our night amazing!"}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes after our brunch food arrived to get my toast, then another 10 minutes to get butter AND they made me pay for it!!

The fiance and I went here after staying at the Aloft for a wedding. We have visited Punch Bowl once in Denver and weren't impressed but there weren't any other walkable brunch options from Aloft, so we gave Punch Bowl a second shot. 

We arrived around 10 and the place was pretty quiet but had a ton of restaurant staff hanging around. Fiance ordered the breakfast taco/s which were okay. I went for toast and a salad, with dressing on the side. As mentioned above, the disaster began when our food arrived. First off, they forgot my salad dressing, so that took about 10 minutes to get. Then, when my food arrived, the waitress notified me that they didn't have wheat bread for toast and asked me to pick from white or multigrain (why they didn't just bring one I don't know). It took 15 minutes to get toast, which was one slice of pan fried bread (did they run to buy bread somewhere). And it came all alone - no butter, no jam, no honey. I had to ask for butter, which took another 10 minutes to get and the bread was cold by the time it arrived. Then the bill came and there was no concession for the toast disaster - I had to pay full price for the cold toast that came 25 minutes after the rest of our food. 

I understand that botching my toast isn't the end of the world, but instead of not ever recommending we go to Punch Bowl, I will now suggest we not go there if a friend brings it up as an option."}
{"text":"Great drinks, fun and activities.  Channel is an angel.  As my 8yo son ate two fresh jalapenos,  she came bu with a glass of milk to save the day!"}
{"text":"I went to  Cleveland to enjoy a girls night out. The Flats was busy so we walked around because we had an hour wait for our restaurant. We walked across this spot and went in. The hostess was nice and social able and got us seated with no problem. After we received waters it took a little minute to order our alcoholic  beverages. When the waitress came to get us she was apologetic. I ordered the Feature Punch for my adult drink. The drink order took a little longer than expected so we left with only appetizers."}
{"text":"Went to Punch Bowl Social for the 1st time and couldn't believe how big it was.  Sat at the bar for a few drinks and staff was very friendly.  Had a great time playing the arcade and other cool games.  For sure going to go back and try some food.  Seems like a great place to hold a party with the variety of cool things they have there."}
{"text":"Are you hungry? The food at Punch Bowl Social is very very good. Go there and eat, it's awesome. The service can be a little mediocre, but the food is worth it.

Are you thirsty? The bartenders at Punch Bowl Social are SUPER hit-and-miss. 

On one occasion, I asked for a Manhattan, up. I received the drink neat, so I asked the bartender to stir the drink with ice and strain it into a glass. He says, \"To me, up is the same as neat,\" in a tone indicating that somehow I was the one who was wrong. So now I'm left in the uncomfortable position of educating a bartender on what the term \"up\" means. This is your job, buddy - you should know the terminology of your profession. (Sidenote: Who orders a Manhattan neat? Gross.)

On another occasion, I was with a few friends at a company event. One friend wanted a drink with tequila, and solicited a recommendation from the bartender (different guy this time). The bartender replied with a thoughtful (and ultimately delicious) recipe, which leaves me thinking \"maybe this guy knows his stuff!\" So, I ordered a Sazerac. His response: \"What the fuck is that??\" in the most obnoxious voice he could muster. I didn't bother telling this bartender that (1) the Sazerac is one of America's oldest known cocktails and (2) it is also enjoying a huge resurgence in popularity in recent years, including in many bars throughout Cleveland, and (3) to use your words, buddy, What The Fuck makes you think it's appropriate to address a friendly customer like that? 

Same night as the second occasion, a third bartender (upstairs bar this time). I ordered a Manhattan, up, and the guy made it to perfection. It was absolutely wonderful and it left me wishing I had more cash on hand for a better tip. This bartender was as professional as any I've encountered anywhere, super friendly, and in a whole different league as compared to the other two in this review.

As you're probably already aware, Punch Bowl Social has approximately one million games for you to enjoy, and it's a super cool place to hang out. But based on the inconsistent service that ranges from indifferent to egregiously terrible to very good, this reviewer gives it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Punch Bowl twice now, both for a weekend brunch. The first time our family thought the experience was very cool -- the place was empty so we were able to eat and play games and check out the entire place. We went this weekend because we had an oversees visitor with us and wanted to show her downtown and it was a BUMMER! Again, at 10:30 on Sunday, the place was almost empty. This visit I was struck by the fact that everything on the brunch menu is so heavy/so much food. There are no light options for someone wanting a smaller breakfast/brunch plate. I was able to order off the kids menu, so that helped. We ordered and then we waited and waited and waited. Finally, our food came out (not at the same time) and much of it was cold! And for the second time, my son's meal was served without the side of bacon. The server and manager informed us that there was some issue with the ordering system. I'm not rushing back here soon!"}
{"text":"First off. I want to say the interior and the bar is done very nicely. In all my years of living downtown I have Never seen worse management. On a Friday we came in with a crowd of 24 at 445pm. We all wanted to have some drinks and maybe bowl. Now I understand this is a big group and hard to accommodate.  We signed up for a bowling alley right away. In the meantime we enjoyed our time standing around the back bar. They have 6 lanes and only two were getting used. They 100 percent refused to let us take one of the vacant lanes. For over 2 hours and actually until we left at 745 there were no other bowlers. In fact from 6pm until when left all the bowling alleys were empty. They downright refused to let us use them. On top of that we wanted to branch off and get a small table for 4 to eat. The place was basically vacant. I counted 16 open tables. They refused to let us sit due to the potential of \"high volume\". This was at 530pm. Again when we left 2 hours later the same tables were empty. Now I don't know who the owner is, but I would be firing people in a second. They lost over 2000 worth of business as everyone went next door.  Reading these reviews it seems that this is a horribly mis managed restaurant. Everybody seemed so confused and they had nothing for procedures.  The reality is simple. The place is waaaaaay to big. In 3 years it will be another Cadillac ranch and be gone. The winter numbers will never produce what is needed to survive. There was so much more that happened. I feel bad for the employees. They were all working hard and doing a nice job. They were just so confused and lacked management direction.  Everyone I talked to was so apologetic when they wouldn't let us sit at the tables that sat empty for 3 hours.  The lost revenue potential was huge.  Please message me if you want to hear more."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and enjoyed the tacos! Great place to have fun BEFORE the club atmosphere gets started around 9pmish?? It gets super loud and they check IDs at the door. It made me feel like I was at a college bar. We left as soon as the place shifted to the club. But it was a good spot for an earlier dinner. Second time I was there was for a work event - and it was great. They gave us our own area and the buffet style food was good!"}
{"text":"Popping my Yelp review cherry with this one. This place was absolutely terrible, which is disappointing because the restaurant itself could be so awesome. Went on a Sunday before a Browns game... They were DEFINITELY understaffed. Our server was actually pretty good, but she could only do so much. Our drinks took 20 minutes because they only had one bartender for a packed bar. Our server even mentioned that one of the bartenders never showed up. My boyfriends cocktail came out and was almost all lemon juice. I got the Pimm's cup which was actually very tasty. 

Now on to the food. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! Our eggplant dip took forever. Come to find out it was because it was delivered to the wrong table. When ours finally came out THEY LEFT THE STORE LABEL ON IT!!! With the sell by date. Then we watched as the food runners delivered our food to the wrong table again!! It sat there for 2 minutes before the server came and picked it up and then delivered it to us.... which I'm pretty sure is against any restaurants food standards? My boyfriend and I both got the corned beef hash. I had ordered mine vegetarian since they advertise doing it that way and it came out with corned beef. SHOCKER!! It was actually disappointing because my first bites prior to noticing were quite good. Food issues didn't stop there... My boyfriend went to bite into what he first thought was a potato, but actually realized it was an entire clove of garlic. Unacceptable. At this point we were furious so we asked to speak to a manager and he was useless. Lazily offered to remake our meals, but at that point we were over it and needed to leave soon to head to the Browns game. So bravo mr. manager. You failed. We still left pissed and hungry. 
  
Overall this place was just beyond disappointing. The staff as a whole does not have their act together. Our poor server had to spend the entire time apologizing for other staff members mistakes. Like I said this place really could be awesome and I'm hoping maybe in a few months when it's not brand new they will have worked more of the kinks out, but for now it's just plain awful. If you're in the area try Beer Head instead."}
{"text":"One star is for being a structure with walls, a ceiling, air conditioning, TVs, and some mechanism for (in theory) ordering drinks and food.

The second star is for the Cavaliers winning the NBA Finals while I was there last night. Punch Bowl Social, you cannot take credit for this star, but I am still in a very good mood, so in my Internet commenter benevolence I grant it to you anyway.

Hundreds of people crammed into this bar to watch Game 7. The management should have been aware that this would happen at least three days in advance. However, there were only two bartenders to serve these hundreds of people. We were seated right at the bar, and it took well over half an hour each time we wanted to be served. Most beers were completely out by the third quarter. Did they not anticipate anything?

Our bartender was not particularly fast, but she was trying, even when the stress was clearly getting to her. It's not her fault - management completely dropped the ball and hung her out to dry. We had some burgers that were good, but not great for being $12-14. This looks like a cool place to be in the flats, but I'm not sure I'll be back after this experience. I've seen the lines out the door that the other reviews mention - shouldn't they be prepared for large crowds?"}
{"text":"My comany planned a regional event at Punch Bowl Social in Cleveland last Friday evening, October 13th. Veronica took care of our party and was so tentative to our group, and unbelievable friendly. Her service was so much appreciated that on behalf of all of us I wanted to give her a little shout out! V, thanks for helping us out of staters have such a great time! We will be back if ever in your city :)"}
{"text":"The bowling alley barely worked. 75% of the time the machine never registered my party's scores. We wasted a lot of time that we paid for entering in scores by hand. The TV service was also very spotty, they must have satellite because the signal was awful and even completely cut out for 10 minutes at a time more than once. The food and drink prices are way too high for the level of quality I expect from the services here. You are better off taking your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch after my HS Reunion.  It was very hot outside and unfortunately, very hot inside too.   We shared the french toast breakfast and it was plenty for 2 of us.  Delicious. Didn't like that you have to pay to park.  Could not find free parking."}
{"text":"Oh Punch Bowl Punch Bowl Punch Bowl.... You sell the awesomeness that you aspire to be through press releases and inexperienced staff but please just please stop..:

You have a menu that no experienced chef could execute during a moderate crowd let alone a waiting list of suburbanite wannabe hipsters that want to bowl then realize that the bowling alleys are mere toy games with strings attached to the pins   

You continue to offer a place with slippery floors (though comical to watch people walk on while sober) yet dangerous for the masses. Food that is a stretch for any restaurant yet alone a grown up chuck e cheese that sells out to corporate institutions that want to make their recent Macedonia State Grads feel like ballers as they drink on the company (dime). 

Enjoy the 7 minutes of (Cleveland fame...AKA WInter) 

Words of advice... Take 14 things out of each entree. Be actually \"social\". The rest will be ok."}

{"text":"Deserves zero stars for the rude waitress! Told us we could sit down if we wanted, but it would be a while before anyone got to us, and she had to clean the table. Then she said, \"I'm just overly tired!\" Lots of other places to go here. Don't need to waste our time with a bad attitude."}

We will definitely be back.  
On a separate note, a group of us went to PBS the night prior to check out the place.  The bar was crowded, but service from Melissa was great.  Lots of fun, great for large groups, and really good value.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! This is the place.. Not Alley Cat or JBMarg( Joke). Come in - they make you feel like you're at home. Food Menu is ok but you should find something. Check it out.. Best place in the flats, so far.. See Eric at the bar. He Rocks!!"}

{"text":"Had a reservation and had to wait 50 after our reserved  time to be seated. Then another 15 minutes to put in drink and appetizer orders and after 15 mins still did not receive our drinks. They admitted it was their fault but did not offer any consolation. Drinks are over priced for the quality I received, drinks were inconsistent  and service was horrible. My friend had his card swiped for another order at the bar and when he told the bartender she acted too confused and had to be told to avoid both transactions by my friend and the other guy before she fixed it."}

{"text":"Three of us visited on a Saturday around noon.  It wasn't too crowded and there was a nice mix of all ages in the restaurant.  
The food was great.  We had excellent fries with lobster and bacon for an appetizer.  I had the Cubano sandwich; it had plenty of meat and it was very tasty.  My friends raved about the mushroom biscuits and gravy.  We had a good time with a punch bowl of mimosa.  Our sever was fun and she gave us the perfect amount of attention."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I am willing to try again. I went on a Saturday night for a friend's 21st birthday. I tried one of the punch bowls and It tasted terrible and e]was extremely expensive. It was so crowded we didn't get to play any games, so we went to the second floor, ordered our nasty punch bowl, drank it and left."}
{"text":"While wandering Cleveland at night, it was crazy hard to find a place that was actually open at around 1130pm, which was weird for a downtown area on a Thursday but winter hours - I guess. After trying 4 different spots, I ended up at Punch Bowl. 

Although the late night menu was much smaller than their regular menu, I was still able to grab some good eats. I had the Street Tacos but subbed out the pork for chicken. I also grabbed the chips and dip, which were kettle chips and a french onion dip and house cut fries. I also grabbed a simple vodka and sprite. Food was great! 

The place looks very entertaining and fun as well - shuffle board, bowling, pool, some games. Nice downtown spot!"}
{"text":"Truffle chips lack truffle salt, but other than that the carnita tacos and Cuban sandwich and fries were delicious, service good and atmosphere lively!"}
{"text":"This place has a really fun atmosphere. A little loud but very lively. Tonight was the first time I've eaten there, but I've gone to drink at night several times. I got a margarita for happy hour and it was good. We started off with the sweet cilantro wings and the truffle kettle chips. I will say that the sweet cilantro wings had some of the best sauce I have ever tasted. Highly recommend. I got the New Mexican as my main plate. It was good, but after several bites, I realized the sauce reminded me of the sauce on Big Macs at McDonald's. The fries were excellent. Oh, and the French Biscuits and strawberry jam they bring out with the appetizers are to die for. I was a little disappointed that they did not serve a full menu until 6, and we got there at 5, so we only had the happy hour menu. I'd like to go back some other time to order off the full menu."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for my birthday party. Fantastic!! Haley (with the cat ears) was on her game that night. She took care of every drink and even helped us get a table for the group when the bowling time ran out - we didn't wait a minute. I suggest asking for her next time you come. Absolutely amazing service."}
{"text":"The hostess was really nice. Also has some very pretty eyes. Service was great and, although the brunch selection is limited, the French toast was really good."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday with family and had a great time. The place is open and sprawling with two massive bars at each end.  High ceilings and an open floor plan make for a loud restaurant when it gets busy.  The menu was interesting and had some great items.  Try the cilantro wings; I could have eaten them all night.  The kettle chips and dip were really good- the only knock is I wish chips came out warm.  The beer and liquor selections were underwhelming to say the least. A lot of beers in cans- not a fan, also no Bushmill's (say what!), for a place with huge bars.  Loved the retro games like NBA Jam (is it the shoes?).  You young people wouldn't understand that.  Bowling alleys were cool as well.  This is a place you can hang out and have some fun; lets get some Bushmill's up in here!

A big shout out to our sever, Chris Williams, who was on point and very attentive all night. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Everyone was so helpful. The bartenders had every answer to any questions I had and even gave me a tour of the whole building. I played all the arcade machines and it was so much fun. The facilities were clean, the whole building was spotless. The drinks didn't have too much flavor though, they mostly tasted like pure liquor but I still drank them. I got to try samples of the various beers before purchasing one. The food was good, I had the street tacos although the meat was a little tough - we got the chicken but it was still good, spicy but I liked them and I'm not usually a fan of spicy anything. The upstairs area had a functioning fireplace and was so cool. They didn't have a big board game selection which was disappointing but we still had fun playing what was available. I would definitely come again but be more way of mixed drink selections. I tried the punch of the day and the bachelors bowl and both were super alcoholic but again the amazing service made up for it. 

Also; we were given the incorrect menus twice before we were able to order our food correctly but that's no big deal the bartender was apologetic and nice about it. The atmosphere is also quite amazing. It's beautifully decorated and the chandeliers and furniture are beautiful to look at."}
{"text":"We surprised our bartender Mark early on a Friday with a 30 person party. Without missing a beat, the crew took excellent care of us. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"My sisters and I chose this place for our littlest sisters 21st birthday after dinner. As soon as we walked in she took her first shot. And immediately spit up from her dinner. The manager, Jaya came over and was completely unprofessional and racist to our entire group. She told us we had to leave. I nicely explained to her that \"our sister was sick from her dinner and this was her first drink. This is her 21st birthday and our whole group of 15 people chose to come here\" she was rude, unprofessional and said that she would not be served. The bar proceeded to ignore us all and give us ALL a hard time of getting drinks. We ended up leaving because we were treated so poorly. She lost this place a lot of business from us. Cool place. Unprofessional and rude manager. 0 stars"}
{"text":"Went to a private party at PBS. Drinks and food were solid!  Would go back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very good service. Actually had 2 servers asking if we needed anything!! Had Cubans and street tacos  and they were bothered excellent and very large portions. Boiled peanuts were a great appetizer. 
Down side was long walk due to closed restroom but still excellent."}
{"text":"Brunch sucked. Service sucked. Food after waiting over an hour sucked. Enough said. Don't waste you money. Interesting concept but the infrastructure food/bar service to support it."}
{"text":"This is one hot spot that packs a real punch. This perfect adult playground features a menu filled with delectable dishes and perfect punch options. Their drink menu features some old school cocktails, new school favorites an a variety of flavorful punches that are single serve but also available in both a small and large punch bowl for sharing with several of your closest friends. With ample square footage there is no shortage of seating and stations to grab a drink. Their 360 bar is quite the site to see.

Gettin punchy is just the beginning. No matter what your favorite pastime chances are PBS has it: arcade games, bowling, board games, shuffle board, ping pong, corn hole, karaoke, billiards.

You won't go hungry while gettin' your game on. Opening night shared a sample of various menu items and there was nothing I wouldn't recommend. By far the best sampling was the Cubano and the sausage stuffed peppers. 

This location was planned to perfection. PBS knows how to party. The staff was friendly and energetic and while the waitresses could learn a little more about menu items and ingredients you couldn't ask for a happier bunch of individuals.

This is a definite must visit!"}
{"text":"I love Punchbowl the food is great and always served hot. The drinks are very good as well. My only complaint is seating when it gets crowded on the weekend. There are so many people just standing around and the nighttime food menu should have more items other than that great place and I truly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend just moved, so we came by here one evening to see what the night life was like in Cleveland! The crowd appeared to be mostly young professionals and it seemed very popular. The place is filled with arcade games, air hockey, and a small bowling alley. Unfortunately, you have to pay for all the games (I might be spoiled by some local bars in Cincinnati, which are all free). I loved the atmosphere in this place and they had plenty of seating and a fire place! The bartenders were all very friendly and the drinks were a little pricy, but high quality so totally worth it. They kept asking if I wanted to try the moscato vodka (which I don't recommend, it tastes like sugar water). Would definitely recommend to young professionals looking for a casual night out. It's surrounded by other restaurants and bars, so great location."}
{"text":"The place is huge.  Our first experience was a private party here.  The company rented out the upstairs which was a nice spacious area with a bar and room to put out food.  The food is very average, nothing great.  The prime rib was LOADED WITH garlic.  I could smell it across the table as my hubby cut it with a knife.  Whoa.  It would be a fun place to bowl and have a few pops but I think I would go somewhere else to grub."}
{"text":"The fact that Punch Bowl Social just opened and it was so packed you couldn't even move inside is a good sign.  I'm impressed.  It's a massive space with bowling, ping pong, billiards, shuffleboard, multiple bars, and a restaurant.  You could seriously come here and kill any form of entertainment craving you are having.  A side note...the drinks are BOMB.  Might I recommend the \"you must bring us a...shrubbery\" drink because I killed a few (no shame) and probably some of the best cocktails I've ever had.

This place is going to do extremely well and I cannot wait to go back because it's been two days since my visit and all I'm thinking about is shrubbery.  I need."}
{"text":"When I'm in CLE with friends, punchbowl can be a Fun experience with good food if you're willing to splurge. The prices are quite high for what you get and drink prices are obscenely high for the quality. 
If you're with a group of friends and looking for an interesting place to hang out or waste time, this place is fun, but I always leave feeling like I paid too much. The service this last time was horrible... the server we had was not knowledgeable about the menu, messed up our drinks (even after letting us sample) she was telling us totally wrong liquors that were in each punch. Very simple order was wrong.
Happy hour prices, on the other hand, are great! They serve yummy biscuits with house made jam. Try going during that time! Otherwise, there are a lot of better places in the area to hang out."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on St. Patrick's Day to escape some of the crowds and a terrible experience across the street at Margaritaville. Although I had visited previously for drinks and games, this was the first time that I had visited for dinner. All in all, I was extremely impressed by the service and the food!

Our server was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu, and checked in on us quite a few times. I ordered the Impossible Burger, and it was very good!! The patty was well-cooked and very sizable. I wasn't a huge fan of the type of cheese they used - it was a little too soft and earthy tasting, but I usually prefer sharper cheeses with burgers so it was probably personal preference. I got fries on the side, and they were also very good!

The ambiance and the fun atmosphere is definitely a positive - it's a great place for group outings and double dates. However, it definitely does get busy and there can be long wait times for games.  

All in all, it's a great place to be on a weekend night or for a fun work outing. Somehow, there is always some type of verbal or physical altercation when I'm there, but I guess that's part of the entertainment, right?"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here before a concert. The food was excellent and the drinks are on point. I had the street tacos and a corpse reviver #2.  I wasn't expecting much from the food, thinking that they would focus more on the games and social aspects, but was pleasantly surprised.  The waitstaff was friendly but I could tell they were new.  Because we were going to the concert, we didn't play any of the games. 

Overall a GREAT experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our server was great she had dreads and our group loved her the tacos were so delicious she modified them in two ways for us veggie and non veggie we will be returning in the future and looking forward to sharing our experience with others! Hailey was her name"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and concept is great but that's where my compliments end. I took my wife there Friday night at 530 and couldn't get a seat to eat because I didn't have a reservation. Seriously half the tables were empty. Okay whatever, went to Beerhead next door and was provided with a good experience and would go back there again. Went back here around 7 to play some of the games. Half the tables were still empty?

I can live with this because I really only wanted to drink and play games anyways.  This is where I am upset. The whole concept is to drink, socialize, and play games. There were private parties reserved where all the games were! Progressive and some birthday parties had everything reserved!!!! You literally couldn't even walk to see what the place looked like because it was roped off. I stood around the bar to watch the end of the OSU game and people were not at all happy. I actually felt bad for the staff to have to deal with all the upset people. OSU game ended and for the next 30 minutes cash explosion played on all the TVs.  There were infinite football games on, Indians were playing, and we are watching cash explosion??? A manager was on a walkie talkie trying to get it changed for a good 20 minutes and after I left it still wasn't changed. 

The worst part was there were only two stalls to use the restroom in the open parts on this place. All the restrooms were where the private parties were so you couldn't use them. Just terrible mismanagement and it left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths. You only get one chance to make a good impression and I doubt I will be going back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday for brunch for my bf's moms birthday. Got there around 12:15 pm and it was pretty empty. The biscuits and jelly they bring out are really good. Three of us had the chicken and waffles and the other two had the standard breakfast. The server told us it would be a while for the chicken because they had just dropped it in the fryer. It did take a while but nothing crazy. The two guys that ordered the standard breakfast enjoyed their food. The waffles were really good but the chicken was dry and over cooked. Didn't stop me from eating it all of course!The syrup they give with the chicken and waffles is pretty good! All in all I think everything is decent. 

Quick tip-make sure you keep your receipt if your paying with your card and paying a cash tip. We split the check and total for the 5 of us was about $75. We left a $20 tip on the table. Checked our bank statement and an extra $10 was added to one of the cards. Always check


*Update* Regarding my note above. The extra $10 was a mistake and the restaurant was able to address the issue."}
{"text":"Went to Punch Bowl last week for lunch. Dre was our server and he took the time to explain the menu and what his favorites were. We ended up ordering wings and tacos and they were amazing. The B and B Alexander is also a must have if you like bananas. We will definitely be back for lunch when we have more time to explore and play games."}
{"text":"My review is purely for my experience at the bar, not of the space itself. I got there on Saturday after the Garth Brooks concert downtown. The place was PACKED. I mean you could barely move inside that's how busy it was. I was meeting my family there and they already had seats at the bar. Unfortunately it was too busy to really get a good look at the place. We were at the bar by the bowling areas and the darts, the one with the antler chandelier (is there more than one? I have no idea...) and positioned right behind the beer taps because there wasn't space anywhere else. Let me just say that is not the best place to be. It took forever to get a drink, I mean at least 10 minutes before anyone even noticed us. Yes I know it was crowded and that's to be expected. What brought the review down was the food at the bar. We ordered chips and salsa and stuffed mushrooms from the small menu (the bar menu has about 4 or 5 items on it). Unfortunately, the salsa was bland and the mushrooms were just...no. Kind of mushy (yes I know they are MUSHrooms, but these were over the top), no flavor and really wet. It was an odd combination to experience. 

I have to say that the fact that this place exists in the Flats is exciting to me. I'm so happy that it's being \"reborn\" with new and exciting places. I'd love to go back when it's not as busy and play some of the games."}
{"text":"Right on the corner of where-Uber-drops-off & Margaritaville sits this two story fun house! Was in for a friends 21st and got rowdy, but bouncers & managers do an awesome job at keeping the peace & safety of this establishment. We went back again & had the loaded nachos which was an amazing appetizer to share! A fun-loving atmosphere for anyone looking to have a nice custom made punchbowl or a bowling round! As a Clevelander, I love this place right near the flats!  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Brunch was great. We had a good liquor coffee and Bloody Mary. The biscuits with strawberry jalapeño jam were yummy. I had baked eggs and my husband had the quinoa hoecake both were awesome. Our server Steven was friendly, helpful and just perfect.  The place was packed as it was Browns game day and we were still only there just over an hour. I thought they did a great job despite being a newer restaurant and we would return."}
{"text":"You need more bartenders. Seriously,  i tried to get a drink in your 3 different bars inside and had to leave the place because I was frustrated.  What does a guy have to do  to get a drink at this place? You need 2 bartenders at each bar because the ones you have are slow as turtles. 
Stop being cheap, hire more bartenders and keep your customers happy and serve drinks fast. Jeez, is it too much to ask?"}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here and Im updating this review since I wasn't clear on the details. My friend's husband booked a party bus to surprise her for her birthday. We all ended up at Punch Bowl social. We spread out and most of us were buying drinks at the bar, supporting the establishment's business. One of the girls had a sealed bottle of alcohol that she removed from her purse (because it was sticky) obviously, it was illegal for her to have the bottle but we weren't drinking it. A bartender spotted her bottle of alcohol and confiscated it. We didn't have a problem with that. Next thing we knew the cops were called and they began kicking us out before we could collect all of our group who came on the bus with us. As soon as we were treated with such blatant disrespect we were happy to leave, but didn't want to leave our friends behind. We were trying to find our friends so we could all leave but the cops wouldn't let us find them (we didn't have their numbers so we couldn't call them) The cops were rude, and had no idea what was going on but felt the need to criminalize and police us when they had no idea what was going on and made assumptions as to who was even in the party with us (Yes, we were also one of the few groups of color in the facility) I will never go back here. I will never support this business and these racist Cleveland cops. It's interesting that one Punch Bowl's representatives decided to comment on this post to defend themselves instead of apologizing for their rude employees and the traumatic experience we had here (no one wants to be confronted by cops when you are simply living your life). Also, I found out later that the girl who brought in the alcohol wasn't even 21 (most of us were 26+), for some reason they didn't even ID her at the door. Punch Bowl Social Cleveland should probably run a tighter and more professional business."}
{"text":"I really don't know how to rate this place.  If I were rating it based on my experiences on a Friday or Saturday night, it would get 1 star (0 if that were possible).  Punch Bowl itself isn't awful, but the hordes of drunken a*holes who show up there on the weekends are - so be forewarned.

The food is actually pretty good though.  My husband and I ate off the late-night bar menu once and there were some good options.  We've been twice for brunch during football season and had good meals.  My only issue is that during Browns' home games they have a SUPER limited menu.  Although I found a decent salad, I had hoped to order off their normal brunch menu, so that was a disappointment.  I've gotten take-out during lunch a couple times and have enjoyed it.  I would like to praise their customer service and give a shout-out to Ed, one of the bartenders.  I placed an order and got stuck on a call (one of those \"this will only take a minute...\") and wasn't able to pick up my food for an hour or so after it had been ready.  Of course I ordered the \"super grilled cheese\" that day, which probably would have been terrible cold.  Ed said he would ask the kitchen to make me a new one, but I felt bad wasting the food, so I asked if they could just reheat it.  When he went back to the kitchen apparently they said it would be better just to remake, so they did that on the fly while I waited, which I really appreciated.

Aside from the food, and the reason most people probably come here, is for the games.  The arcade games are fun, but it's kind of annoying that you have to pay.  I get that if they were free people would camp out and play all night, but maybe they could do a token system?  Like every drink/food item you buy you get x-number of tokens?  They have a few lanes for bowling, I believe two dartboards, and Ping-Pong tables upstairs.  They also have a karaoke room (like Korean style where you get your own room) that looks pretty fun.

Definitely worth checking out if you haven't been.  To the extent possible, do yourself a favor and try to go Sunday through Thursday.  You will enjoy it much, much more."}
{"text":"Alright. Cool place to eat food and have drinks, UNLESS you don't have a pallet. Can someone remind me what we were talking about? I like how the server sometimes will ramble though the specials for almost 10 minutes, it keeps you on your toes, because you're very unsure when they're gonna leave you alone. Anywayyy, the food here is really good and filling! I think they should consider getting rid of all the games and fun and turn it into a gastropub! Right? I'm unsure what a gastropub is, BUT, I know it sounds cool, and for the record I do know what a wine bar is. I'm digressing.

One more suggestion: please start calling it social bowl punch. Because the social is the biggest piece of this place, THEN the bowl (I've only ever gotten a plate), then the punch (I refuse to try it). I recommend for dinner and for drinks. Yeeep."}
{"text":"My husband planned a surprise 30th birthday get together there this past Sunday. It was pretty bad. They gave us an awkward space for 20 people which was too spread out and not accommodating for socializing but instead segregated everyone. Food was over priced and not very good. There was so much left over because no one wanted to eat it. Being from out of town we didn't know what to do with it all. The only group activity open was bowling because the karaoke rooms were all broke down and the upstairs was rented out which limited us to just bowling or splitting up in the arcade area. It was kind of a bust. We had more fun when we went next door to the Big Bang. I could have definitely found a better place to spend 2k for my birthday especially when traveling in from out of state to celebrate. Only good thing was the waitstaff was good I guess, I'm not sure really because the only thing I ordered in the 3 hours we were there was a red bull and an iced tea. The management was really rude and not accommodating at all. I am not sure what it is like to attend with friends but for an event where you plan on spending a few grand... take your money elsewhere or set yourself up for disappointment at Punchbowl Social"}
{"text":"I have good stuff to say and some bad. First, this place is really cool. Lots to do and lots to see. Very reasonably priced drinks and food. We enjoyed ourselves very much. The old school arcade games and pinball were a blast. Bowling looks awesome and the set up couldnt be better. Second, the food was very good. We have the spicy mango jalapeño quesedillas and the street tacos. Both were tremendous. Service at the social bar (middle of the three bars) was good. 

Heres where the story takes a turn. I ask for my tab which came to $31 and some change.  I had started a tab with a debit card when the night started but I gave $40 in cash to close out the tab. I just happened to check my bank account this morning and was surprised to see the $31 charge to my account. So essentially i left a $40 tip. Now...Im generous but not that generous. I called PBS and the manager was very accommodating. He also told me that this was a continuous problem that theyve been having. I told him you either have a serious POS training issue or you have a bunch of thieves working there. 

Be sure to check your statement after you visit this place. Just sayn...."}
{"text":"Great set up! Fun for a big group of people! Strong drinks reasonably priced. Out of towner visiting friends in the area and this was the best part of the night"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group before heading out on the east bank. It's not on the menu anymore, but it was recommended we order the cauliflower nachos by a friend which we got three servings for the whole table! Those were amazing . The burger also looked good. Meat and cheese platter was okay. I also ordered the poutine which was pretty good as well. We had some minor issues splitting the check for a big group. 

Everyone said their drinks were pretty good . They make their own grapefruit soda water so I did that with vodka and I will now be ordering that every time we come here !"}
{"text":"2 weeks ago I made reservations for a group of my employees for a mid-day holiday \"outing\" at PBS. Yesterday we had our team event at your facility and it was incredibly disappointing. 

(1) The service was outrageously slow. It took our waitress about 10 - 15 minutes to bring someone from my team one cocktail (\"high fashion\"). 

(2) When making a reservation in advance for a large party to be seated for dinner, apps and drinks you would think we would get a large table - rather we were seated at a large high-top table which was incredibly uncomfortable and not conducive to a party setting. There wasn't nearly enough room for apps and drinks, let alone dinner. 

(3) After putting in for cocktails and apps we started to notice how everything in PBS was \"roped off\". Mind you, we made our reservation for 3:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon. The bowling alleys were all off limits, the arcade off limits, the shuffleboard table off limits, the back room/bar area off limits, fireplace sitting area off-limits, and upstairs entirely off-limits/roped-off. I kindly asked our waitress what the occasion was and she said there was a company even later on in the evening - starting at 6:00pm. So in my mind and logically thinking, this meant from 3:30pm - 6:00pm these areas should be available for guests for the next 2.5 hours. That was not the answer we received. I then waited a few moments to ask again because I was confused - and received the same answer. That they were reserved for a party coming in at 6:00pm. I can also tell you we did stay at PBS until about 7:15pm and no one was still using the bowling lanes, shuffleboard, arcade or fireplace seating. The displays all just said \"reserved\" with no one using them. 

(4) Once we closed out our tab at the initial table-top seating area I then opened a separate tab at the bar and tried to put in an order for food as well. However, the bartender told me I could not put in an order for food at the bar and needed to see a waitress or waiter and someone should assist us and our party. I can tell you at no point in our nearly 4 hour stay and aside from sitting at the initial high-top, did any waitress, waiter or employee ask us if we needed anything - despite many walking by. I can also say I have never been to a place where you cannot give a bartender money and an establishment does not want to take our order or our money. Here I was trying to put in for additional nachos, wings, etc. and was being told no? That is insane. I literally came back my group and I told them I attempted to put in an order and was rejected. They laughed at how this place kept getting more interesting by the moment. So not only could we not playing any games, activities, etc. but now we also couldn't put in for a food order even. 

Needless to say, we ended up leaving shortly thereafter and took our party to a bar next door where we ordered two pizzas, pretzels and drinks - all without reservation from our waiter. I think you can maybe take 10 - 20% of the experience and blame it on the party that was in attendance; however, many other guests were also complaining about the same experience. It was an experience welcomed by the word \"no\" rather than - \"have fun.\" Can we bowl? No. Can we put our name on the list to bowl? No. Can we play shuffleboard? No. Can we sit by the fireplace? No. Can we order food? No. Can we get a more comfortable table for sitting? No. Can we go upstairs? No. 

Right now if someone asked anyone in our party if they'd come back I'd venture to say they'd say the same. No."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed for a couple reasons...
1) I called a couple weeks in advance to make reservations for a bachelorette party.  They called back FOUR times to confirm.  It wasn't a super huge party -- 9 people.  I felt 4 times was excessive...in addition to the emails.
2) During those calls they kept reminding me that many games are blocked out for group parties.  I said each time they called that it was fine and that we were more focused on drinking because we were starting a bachelorette party for the night...which made reason #3 more frustrating since I warned them.
3) I arrived 15 minutes early to put some decor on the table.  Our server was at the table at the time. I said I'd like a bottle of champagne and to fill champagne glasses before everyone arrives so we can immediately toast the bride.  The server went missing for 20 minutes. By that point all but one guest arrived and we had no glasses and no champagne.  It wasn't until about 15-20 minutes after the party start time that we finally got it.  Our cocktails didn't come out until about 45 minutes after we arrived.  It was all very, very slow to get our drinks.  I think it was super slow bar service but in the beginning it was certainly the server's doing.  I will point out this was at 5pm and it was pretty darn dead in the restaurant at the time.

The food was good and everyone was happy with their selections.  I think I had the Cuban.  Many had the chicken and waffles and I heard positive things.  I doubt I'll be returning.

Update: I was contacted by a manager and I described our server. She asked for my contact info which I think most people assume they will be sending you something but nearly a month has passed and I've heard nothing. I don't appreciate being asked to give out my info for no apparent reason."}
{"text":"Two stars is for the tacos. ONLY.  we came here Saturday night and a young lady with redish dreds was bartending upstairs....we recognized her today only because while we were eating she literally walked up 2 our table and asked to bum a cigarette. She was obviously off work and just chilling but seriously?? We were eating...Classy joint."}
{"text":"Finally made it here! Been wanting to check this place out and finally got around to doing it. As soon as we walked into the bar area we were greeted by Veronica. She was so great right from the start, telling us where everything was, games, bowling, rooftop bar etc. she also recommended her favorite drink which i ordered and it was really, really good!  Very cool place, perfect for couples or large groups. Would highly recommend this place and Veronica if she is working. She was always around if we needed anything or had any questions. Great server!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. The service was not quick. I did not like their own old fashion soda. They do have big enough bathrooms when it is busy. They tables are too narrow to eat dinner. Cool idea/theme and good cocktails. I have a issue with the parking. Way too expensive when other local bars/restaurants in Northeastern Ohio have fee parking."}
{"text":"First of all, The Flats East Bank is one of THE best new spots in CLE. I hear it used to get a bad rap for being dangerous, but the developers have done a great job by making the area safe. There are bright lights ALL around, so no matter where you are you feel safe. 

Now  - on to PB... This place is huge! Came here for a Yelp event and I couldn't have imagined a better place for a Yelp party! I took Uber there, but you can park in the lot for $7 I believe. 

Right when we walked in, we were greeted by the friendly staff. They directed us upstairs to where the party was held. All of the staff was helpful with drink suggestions and clearing of tables. 

There were lots of things to \"play\" with after we finished eating. Bowling, darts, shuffleboard, karaoke, etc. A true BIG KID playground. The arcade games were really cool too! 

I'd recommend PB for any sort of celebration or gathering. One big plus is the giant bar on the first floor. It's big enough to where you can fit a lot of people and if you were playing a game and needed a new drink, there was plenty of room instead of being elbow to elbow like most bars. 

Got to talk to one of the higher ups from Denver and he seems to be just as excited as we were to have a fun location in the Flats!"}
{"text":"So I went back into Punch Bowl about a week or so ago. I had been contacted by a manager after my last review and they kindly sent me a $25 gift card with a note welcoming me back. When I received it my first thought was \"wow, they really didn't need to do that, I'll give them another shot\". 

Flash forward to my visit the other week... Margaritaville had just opened and was absolutely packed before the USA match downtown. \"I have a gift card for PBS, let's go there!\" We go up to their newly opened rooftop and much to our delight there's only about 10 customers up there. We belly up to the bar and subsequently wait 20 minutes before we were even acknowledged by staff. We watched as one bartender counted his drawer for 10 minutes as the other bartender slowly fulfilled all the orders (the bartender who counted his drawer had already taken cash transactions before he counted his drawer and stayed on shift and continued to use the drawer AFTER he counted; as someone who has worked in the industry this literally makes no sense to me). After 20 minutes we were greeted with \"Hi, so sorry, it's going to be another 10 minutes before we get to you.\" (Anger Level- 2/10)

So we go downstairs to the second floor where there are roughly 5 people at the bar and one bartender. We belly up again, and it's another 10 minutes of waiting. Finally, we are served 6 Miller Lite cans (all three of us ordered 2 each as we did not want to go through this whole ordeal again soon). (Anger Level- 5/10)

Flash forward about 30 minutes and it's time for another round. We belly up and it's another 20 minutes. I've seen stressed out bartenders before but this guy took the cake. He had 4 drinks to make but to watch him you'd think he had about 100 orders to fulfill. 20 minutes later we got 6 more beers. (Anger Level- 7/10)

Flash forward for the final round. We needed a few more beers as the game was still an hour out but we knew they weren't going to be here. We go to cash out and the wait was only 5-10 minutes (which felt like 30 seconds in comparison). I hand him my gift card and he says \"Uh I'm going to need a manager to come up here for this, it's gonna be awhile.\" I told him to run it when he could and we'd be back in 10 minutes to cover the last few dollars. We get back and he says \"sorry, this card isn't active\". After a 5 minute back and forth I throw up my hands and reluctantly pay the entire bill. (Anger Level-10/10)

Overall I've had two of the worst bar/dining experiences of my life here. The non-active gift card was the icing on top of the cake for me. I would have never returned without that card and to send a non-active one is deception at the very least, and borderline theft.

Really cool concept with the different games/activities, great location, TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"We had our company Christmas party at Punchbowl and had a fantastic time. The events team was incredibly helpful and took the time to ensure that we had everything we needed including extra tables and everything set up the way we wanted it. We did appetizers, dinner and dessert and reserved bowling lanes. The food was delicious, the venue was comfortable and felt upscale and everyone loved the party. Definitely recommend it for events."}
{"text":"Do you like jam? How about FREE jam AND biscuits?? If so, you will probably enjoy Punch Bowl Social. This was my first time there, unfortunately, half of the place was closed due to private parties with no access to games (isn't that the whole point?), I certainly didn't go for the jam, the incredibly rude waiter who was pissed off that we only got drinks and no food, or the busser who hovered over as as we got ready to leave. With so many other options for local fun, games, food, and drinks, skip this chain and try something else. I certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"Great concept but horrible service. Been waiting at the bar for 15 min and still no drink. The bartender came by twice and nothing. It shouldn't take all Night to get a drink."}
{"text":"Massive bar with some cool stuff to do. Been here 4 times and really wanted to try one of the punch bowls. Had friends in town and he ordered it and with tip it cost him $72. There were 5 of us and the bowl came with tiny cups and a small ladle. The small cups and ladle might be their attempt at tricking you into thinking you're drinking a lot. After we filled our glasses once we looked at the bowl to find basically only ice left. We asked to talk to a manager and the man that came to speak with us was beyond useless and indifferent. As a bar that just opened I was really surprised he wasn't more helpful to try and correct the problem. He gave us a round of domestic beers for free and went on his way... $20 bucks of Budweiser for our $72 ice bowl. 

The place has a cool theme and great bar but if they're going to call themselves Punch bowl and then serves $72 ice buckets people aren't going to be coming back. It tasted like crap, but that's just my opinion, my friends didn't mind it.

Don't get the punch bowl"}
{"text":"All-in-all, an OK effort in an up and coming location. There's been a big push to make the flats into a party area, which seems like a great idea. I was there on a weekend summer night recently and there were a lot of people out having a good time, plus it was nice being down by the water. I think the waterfront is an under-utilized Cleveland resource, so it's nice to see the area taken advantage of.

Anyhow, more specific to the venue, it's pretty big, so it would be a good place to hold a party or bring a group. In the late afternoon/evening, Punch Bowl is more of a restaurant with activities (bowling, shuffleboard, arcade games, board games)--then it transitions into a bar scene at night. The drinks are a a little underwhelming; the name and the vibe obviously creates expectations of a great drink, which none of the punches were either of the times I have been there. The food is also ok, but definitely on the heavy side (think multiple mayo-ish sauces on one grilled chicken sandwich) and pricey. The only comment I'm going to make about the service is that, combined with the atmosphere, it felt more like what you would get at a chain sports bar or (throwback!) Chevy's-type place than what's expected at a nice bar or lounge-y restaurant, which is the vibe I think they're going for.

The main points I have is that they get credit for unique-ness, but I would like to see more effort in the food, drink, and service/atmosphere departments, one that could stand up better to some of the amazing restaurants and bars Cleveland has to offer. That combined with the fun new location would make Punch Bowl excellent instead of just ok."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Saturday brunch and totally loved the contrasting vibe to the crazy party night scene to the relaxing and chill morning meal. My husband ate every bite of his chicken and waffles but did mention he wished it was a tad spicier.  I loved my chicken biscuit sandwich with crunchy fingerling hash browns.  After our tasty meal we had plenty of space to get our game on in the laid back game rooms."}
{"text":"Noisy and loud.  Did not like the burger - avoid it!  Poutine? Have had much better and expect to have better in the future but just not here.  You can find better food on West 25th.  Sorry - nothing to see here folks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch- highly recommend the cubano. Our server Jenna was amazing as well, engaging and sweet. Lots of fun activities to do as well."}
{"text":"Punch bowl social is the place to be in Cleveland! Good times, good food, everything you could want and more like karaoke and tons of games.  Also, we loved our server Mariah! So cute and helpful!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but definitely greasy.  The biggest issue by far is that the kitchen is much too small to keep up with the demands of the patrons. We had a 6:45 pm reservation for a party of 4, and placed an order for appetizers shortly after arriving.  The appetizers were served around 7:45 pm and the entrees arrived a few minutes before 9:00 pm.  Other complaints include, a shortage of bowling lanes and games for the size of the crowds/establishment and very dirty bathrooms (uni-sex to top).  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went there during the Flats Arts Fest 8/19/17. When we walked in there were approx 20 tables open on the main floor and outside. However, we were told that a table for 4 would be 45 mins. We were directed to sit in the bar area near the bowling lanes for first come first serve seating as there were \"open tables\" in there. The tables however were nothing more than small high bar tables. But being hungry we took a seat. It took a good 5 mins for a server to make his way to our table.  Mind you, the place was NOT packed, there were no other people waiting for tables, and there was plenty of staff mingling around. 

The menu is sparse and the offerings bizarre. One of us ordered the burger which she said was good. It came with fries. Another friend ordered the $15 fried chicken 'entree\".  When it came to the table, it contained a burnt wing, a thigh and a leg. Along with a 1/4 cup sized side of chopped tomatoes and jalepeno's \"salad\". I kid you not, that is all this meal came with. I ordered the $9 wedge salad. Which ended up being about a 1/8 sliver of a head of lettuce with bacon crumbles, chopped egg, cheese and dressing. 

We were not allowed to go to the rooftop bar because it was being held for a private party later that afternoon.

As we walked out the door to leave after our \"meal\", the same 20 some tables were empty and no one was waiting to be seated. 

I will never go to this establishment again and I highly recommend you do not waste your time or money here either."}
{"text":"The drinks here are good but not worth the price you pay. This is Cleveland, not NYC 
There was one bartender who was servicing both the people at the bar and those seated so it took forever to get drinks. I legit waited 20 mins in between drinks. Won't be going back here because the service just wasn't what I'm used to. If you can, go to Beerhead down the street. It's much better!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible and took a really long time to get to our table I'm talking like 1.5 hours and so I ordered corned beef hash and the meat was the consistency of steak and was gray which is wierd because it's usually a pinkish hue"}
{"text":"I've been here for drinks a few times, and kareoke once.  Always had a great time, although I would rate the kareoke selection to be below average.  This is a pretty solid anchor for the East Bank, and draws a fun crowd.  The space is the best part, and the circular bar was very well done.  

A few things that seemed odd to me, that I think they should fix:

Nowhere to keep score on the dart boards - Come on, I'm sure you can figure this one out.

Change machine broken for the arcade games - very disappointing, but I get that things break occasionally.  To be fair though, why even charge for the arcade games?  Honestly, how much revenue are you generating from the arcade games?  Is it worth the hassle of forcing your customers to get quarters?  Please reconsider.  

Make sure the coat check is staffed.  At the end of the night nobody was there to bring me my coat, so I just walked in and grabbed it.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Dive Bar I love ya, but I think Punch Bowl has officially become my new hangout spot. This place is SO AWESOME!! 

The food: It's absolutely delicious! I highly recommend the Seared Tuna & Soba Noodles. My mouth is watering just thinking about how perfectly cooked the tuna and noodles were. My friend got the very serious grilled cheese sandwich and although I just had a bite it was so damn good.

The drinks: We ordered 2 punch bowls, first the *You must bring us a....Shrubbery* bowl and it was so good we decided to order another. This time we tried the Bachelor's Bowl. Both bowls were delicious and made for quite a fun night!

The games: So far I've played pool, shuffle board, ping pong and a few arcade games here but the thing that takes the cake for me is the KARAOKE!!!!! OMG I've never had so much fun in my life singing karaoke! My friend and I came here the other night solely for karaoke and it was a blast! It's $25 for a group of 4 or more usually for an hour and we sang at least 7 or 8 songs. They have everything from oldies to newbies, country to rock n roll. The karaoke rooms are closed off in little rooms but we decided to open ours to the public and let others come in and join us. It's seriously the best guys!!

Lastly I complement the service. I've never had an issue with the staff, in fact I've had enjoyable conversations with several bartenders and servers. The managers are all friendly, courteous and accommodating to requests. 

Come revel in the beauty that is punch bowl! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chef's Cup, but it ended up just being seltzer water with some cucumber slices floating in it with not even a hint of cardamom. Service was incredibly slow, and we seemed to get a new waiter every time someone came to check on our table so we never really knew who the waiter was. Waited over half an hour to finally order food and more than half an hour to finally get it. The food was roughly Applebee's quality for double the price. All of the free games weren't put out because it was \"too busy.\" Best part of being there was when I got flashed by a drunk customer at a nearby table."}
{"text":"Great place for you and friends to hangout and have a great time. Food is top notch and the staff is very friendly and helpful. They now have the rooftop area open so it makes a great social area in the evening time."}
{"text":"Hailey with the cat ears was amazing she gave our group awesome service super knowledgeable about the drinks, fresh lemonade and titos, she was able to explain how everything was locally imported and freshly made. And we especially love the cat ears this is our favorite new place in Cleveland we are coming back!"}
{"text":"Worst hostesses ever. They are the rudest women I have ever met. They didn't tell my group we didn't need to be seated at a eat. They were very rude and yelled at someone in my group.  Kelly should really get some training in customer service! Please give training when hiring. I will never return."}
{"text":"The only reason this place got more than one star was because of Pam Higgins. She did such a fantastic job  with what she was given to provide everyone with what they wanted in light of pool/bowling/ping pong aspect. What a kind soul. Made the experience worth it and she is the only reason I'd return. If she were to get this message, Thank you Pam. The world needs more people like you."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday night around 7:30 and had no trouble finding a table in one of the free seating areas. Upon entering, we noticed multiple pinball machines and games, including shuffleboard, bowling, and other video games. Definitely a plus for me!

We took a table upstairs, and I found the environment to be fantastic: There was music that was not too loud and I could hear my friends speak, and our server was friendly and helpful. We ordered a punch bowl as well as nachos to share and I had the farmer's salad with ahi tuna. This review will be a bit redundant if I list my reaction to everything, so I'll sum it up by saying that everything we ate and drank was delicious. While the vegetarian options weren't ample, they were there, and I was easily able to find several items I was interested in.

Honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better night; this restaurant is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone. Food, games, drinks, cool environment, great service. I have been here on several occasions. The food is always great and the staff is always friendly. They do get busy on the weekends so if you are coming here for dinner, expect a wait. Not to worry though because they have fun games and multiple bars to keep you busy while you wait to be seated. They have a few bowling lanes, pool tables, and arcade games as well. The restaurant is also located in the flats which is surrounded by many other nice restaurants and bars within walking distance. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat dinner in a fun environment."}
{"text":"I just picked up my jaw up off the floor after taking the grand tour. Since Cleveland is the greatest city in the world, and this is now the greatest place in is city, one must conclude that this is the greatest place in the world. Yes, I am making that conclusion. I'm going to play some shuffle board and eat some tiny cupcakes now, bye."}
{"text":"Our server hailey with the cat ears in the lanes was amazing suggested great menu items and we especially loved the featured punch not from Cleveland but we will be returning soon hope to see a punch bowl come to Columbus!!!!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try a new bar down in the flats, and it was probably the worst decision ever. It was a very busy Saturday night, so we immediately headed to line up at the biggest bar. After waiting 25 (literally) minutes to be served by bartenders swamped with too big sections and not a clue how to make the majority of the drinks, we decided to have everyone order at once. My friend had to change her drink order 3 times, as they did not have two types of bourbons. They also could not make my friend a dirty martini, as they do not carry olives.  When asked to make 6 Kamikaze shots (cheap and easy), the bartender did not have a clue how to make them, and then proceeded to charge $8 a shot for something containing the tiniest amount of alcohol.  They also did not have orange juice at Punch Bowl. Overall, this was the most disappointing experience I have ever had at a bar, and could not wait to go next door to the Big Bang Piano Bar."}
{"text":"I only tried the rooftop bar and no food so no 5 stars. Bartenders were friendly and attentive. I had the happy hour house sparkling which was $5 and I was super pleased.  It was a sparkling rose and was not too dry or too sweet. Great choice. The rooftop bar was really cool and urban, a bit of a hipster vibe."}
{"text":"Slowest and most unaware bartenders in the world. Took forever to get a drink. They're very nonchalant, zero hustle. These guys need training, motivation or something. Management must be terrible. Fools."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hang out spots in Cleveland! Weve made friends every time we've come. Great food, drinks, and our server Hailey is awesome too!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! our server, Hailey was awesome! Absolutely loved the ears too!! She was super quick with our drinks and we were never empty, we will be returning next week to see her! Her style was totally unique and what we love to see in a server!"}
{"text":"A place with a lot of potential just extremely crowded. DO NOT get drinks from the guy with the glasses and man bun!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that the wait staff are very nice. However, I was pretty disappointed at management's and the kitchen's lack of customer service. First we asked for a drink menu at least 2 or 3 times then when we finally got it, it wasn't the drink menu rather a food menu that we already had. Finally, we had to get up and go to the host stand to get our own drink menus. Fine, won't get too annoyed by that. Also, we are vegetarians, which was very clearly stated before we ordered anything. When our order first came out, it was wrong. Meaning we ordered vegetarian nachos and the server accidentally brought out another table's order. We had looked at the nachos and noticed that it had chicken so we sent it back right away and the correct order came out within a minute or two. That's when it started going south a little for us. We had also ordered a salad that was already vegetarian on the menu. We had a few bites and saw a piece of chicken in it. It took about 20 minutes for our waiter to show up and when we sent it back they hoped that we wouldn't follow up. When I asked again about the salad and whether it would be remade or taken off our check seeing as we didn't eat it, the waiter said \"oh yeah the kitchen won't remake it bc you ate a little bit of it,\" to which I responded \"can you at least remove it from the bill as we didn't even get to eat the salad bc it had meat in it.\" The waiter said that he'd talk to the manager to see what he could do. It wasn't until the check finally came that the waiter said the manager wouldn't take it off the bill, but he took care of it. That is literally the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2. Not once did the manager come over to even apologize for the mistakes that had been made. Terrible. I'd go back for drinks, but that's literally it. I would not go to eat there especially when they are busy bc I don't think their kitchen and wait staff are equipped to handle it. Unfortunate bc the food that we were able to eat was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"My sister bday party was here and she loved the entertainment but when it came down to eating we had bad service. The server had a attitude and as we waited for our food we had to ask for another server. When the other server came he was attentive and wanted to make us happy. As he came to the table he wanted to check 2 make sure the 1st girl ordered things right and we found out that she never rung in our food. It was a game on so it was crowded and took a long time for the food 2 come. We asked 4 a manager and she took a long time to come 2 the table. She said she would comp off some food. Bout time the food came we was so disappointed waiting over a hrs. Manager never came bk to the table 2 check up on everything. My sister had a specialized cake paid almost $200. Waited a long time 4 the cake 2 come out after she requested. About 20 mins of waiting for cake 2 come out the server and host asked if she wanted the cake cut and my sister said no she will cut it herself. Cake came out cut and was falling everywhere. Manager the lady did not want 2 come 2 our table and had the server delivering messages to comp the check, give a gift card to come bk, and offered a dessert. Took a long time for 2 gift card 2 come they never asked her what dessert she wanted. When the gift card came, there was no price given or no number to call on the bk of the card. I assumed it was a $10 gift card. Another manager over heard us complaining as we got ready to go. Listened to us vent and he was very understanding. He gave everyone gift cards and my sis got more money on her gift card. As my sis called up 2 speak with someone the next day they also reimbursed her for the cake. We were going to come bk 4 the next game 2 try again but I think them gift cards might sit on the dresser 4 a while. We also had food sent 2 our table that wasn't our order and heard a worker say the server don't know their table numbers. It was a one time thing hopefully whenever we do decide to go bk 2 spend the gift cards we have a better experience. Not on a busy day. Time we were there was 9pm til almost 1am on a Friday."}
{"text":"On our last night in Cleveland we decided to visit the waterfront and try this restaurant.

Wow.

Fresh.  Food.

We had the black eyed pea hummus with kettle chips, radish and cucumbers.  Amazingly fresh.

I had the beef quesadilla that came with a radish and onion salad.  Amazingly served and perfect flavour.

We wish we were here longer so that we could stop by for dinner again.

Servers were attentive and really knew their menu.

Check this place out if you can.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Be aware of party reservations!! This place would've received a better review had we gone just for dinner, however our group went for dinner as well as the fun factor that they advertise. 

THE GOOD: 

The food was delicious! I got the superfoods power bowl and it was amazing. We also got the hummus appetizer which, although it was good, was not much hummus for the price. We had really good service most of the night as well. 

THE NOT SO GOOD: 

Most important piece of advice I could give for this place is to call ahead, and specifically ask if there are any party reservations on the day you are planning to go. This was our first visit here, and none of us would've expected the entire upper floor to be rented out by a private party for the whole night... 

This meant we were restricted to downstairs only which consisted of bowling, board games, a karaoke room, and one shuffleboard table game. Technically downstairs also has a small arcade room, but it was also reserved for a private party!!  

The drink menu... probably okay for some people, but I honestly could not find a single drink that I liked. I ordered at least 5 and just kept giving them away. Might be a small gripe on my part, but I've never been to a place where I couldn't find SOMETHING that appealed to my taste. (I finally ended up requesting a common cocktail from the bar.)

I flip flopped between a 3 star and 4 star for my review, but since I wasn't blown away by the place and have no interest in making the drive back, it gets a 3."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time celebrating my birthday here! We rented the back lanes so we could have space to be with our group and not get squished. It was fantastic pick for us. We had about 24 people total, ordered some appetizers and 2 bowls to start our guest off. The service was great during our time with the lanes, very attentive nice servers! All the staff we dealt with for our party were great. 
Why only four stars if I enjoyed myself?? Personal preference more than anything... 
The food isn't what I feel is fitting for games and partying. Don't get me wrong the food was fantastic, esp the tacos, & they had some burger options but it was just 'trying to fancy'? Price of food wasn't really that bad at all! The drinks also aren't my taste, they don't have many things I prefer, again personal preference. I ended up only doing shots and water all night, which actually worked out great over all! 
The last thing is on the weekend it is just undoable for me to want to stand shoulder to shoulder and just be bumped around- reason why we rented the private bowling area! We had our rental for 4 hours and after that we went out to the floor with the Saturday night crowd, which really is just over crowded. Tried to enjoy a drink but it was just way too much! We left and got pizza before calling it a night. 
All and all a great place to go to && Amazing place of you rent an area for yourself!! We felt we got our money's worth for everything we got when doing so!"}
{"text":"Cold food,bad service, water down drinks ....don't come here unless you drunk and full already. ROB the manager is the worst ever he is so immature and disrespectful ."}
{"text":"ever get a gift as a child while younger, you played with for a few weeks, then threw it away because you had no use for it?

this is my opinion of what punch bowl social will become.  the concept is cool, but after going there, i don't see myself frequenting this spot too much more.

the actual punch bowl was overpriced and bland.  i felt like i was at a lame party from when i was 13.  the bar/club is huge...but i think they tried to do too much with it, by having a bowling alley and other games there.  sometimes oversaturation is not a good idea.  there are other places that already have their niché set.

ultimately, it's decent, decent staff, but i wouldn't be surprised if it drops off after a couple of months."}
{"text":"The 45 year old new bartender that was working Thursday June 15th in the evening, it was her fourth day in training.. was super rude and disrespectful...me and my group of friends were there for no more then five mins when the manager came over and let us know the bartender felt uncomfortable serving my friend .. my friend was completely sober and respectful !!! We left we couldn't believe how we were treated !!!!!!! Keep this bartender and I promise you you will lose customers !!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a drink. Cool place with lots of games and good drink selection. Might get annoying when crowded, but cool when slow. Nice rooftop bar too."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're in your early 20s and from out of state! Terrible experience with a rude bouncer. This bar must hate people from out of state. I was in town with friends, who are local to Ohio, and my real South Carolina ID was questioned. The lanky brunette bouncer was hard core examining my ID when, instead of asking for a second form of identification like any other person would do, he proceeded to bend my driver's license in half, breaking it. He told me it was fake \"because it broke too easily.\" It broke because SC IDs aren't supposed to be bent in half, they're plastic, not paper. He then pointed me to the cop behind him to give my SSN to prove that I was of age. After that, when I was cleared to go, he didn't even apologize to me for breaking my driver's license. This caused me an unnecessary, miserable trip to the DMV & losing $25. I think he has a vendetta against southerners, but who knows."}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for a wedding and we went to Punch Bowl for breakfast on a Saturday morning. 

Our server Stephen was great and offered a lot of ordering guidance. We all ordered something different and everything was great. The highlight for me was the chicken and waffles, but the hash, bisquit sand gravy and French toast were all great. 

The only downfall of this meal was that they won't serve liquor before 11am (even on a Saturday). We were hoping for bloody Mary's. 

We took a walk around to see the games and it looked like a great spot to hang out. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite bars! Sometimes a girl has had a stressful week, and needs to drink her body weight in liquor (easy to do if you're a basic bitch like me and get the actual punch bowl for just yourself). 

It's ALWAYS busy here, but the bar tenders mean business. Your drinks come out fresh, fast, and delicious (and superrr strong- you get what you pay for!). 

This is a multilevel bar WITH a bowling alley! I love hanging out upstairs because there's more of a chill vibe and less people judging you as you drink out of your bowl with a straw. Lol"}
{"text":"Where old school and new school meets. Punch Bowl Social is the new West 6th but in a really good way. Its a place for adults of all ages who can have a good time, play old school games, drink and listen to current music. And did i mention the food is good? They have this burger that is their version of a Big Mac. Really good."}
{"text":"Was visiting Cleveland for my company and a group of my coworkers stumbled soon punch bowl awesome selection of drinks and Hailey G was the best super knowledgeable and very friendly loved her outspoken personality! Next time we are in from Philly this will be the first place we come back to visit!!"}
{"text":"Not sure exactly how I feel yet seeing it was my first time dining with them tonight. Experience overall was pretty good.. The drinks were good as well as the burgers we got. Only issue they didn't correctly modify my burger how I asked & the lettuce was brownish (when I took the bun off I noticed) ickk...  It wasn't very busy on the first floor (we didn't go upstairs) and our server took awhile to get our drinks other than that it wasn't a bad experience. Just needed a little more attentiveness. 

The restaurant itself was nice!! Very clean and modern. It was only a Monday but I see this place having a lot of potential! This isn' accurately rated appropriately only because I didn't see the rest of the restaurant (meaning the upstairs.) I would have put in the tip section but I exceeded the character count  I would definitely go back though.!!"}
{"text":"Really cool inside with a lot of fun options. It gets insanely busy at night though. Bowling seems to be pretty popular here. Atmosphere is really cute inside. Great patio upstairs. Drinks are standard price. Staff is really nice"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the bar action - didn't eat here - annnnnd we came in fairly late on a Saturday. It wasn't as crowded as some others had mentioned, but the mass of drunk people in the late night was oddly reminiscent of the old days on the East Bank. Yeah, I'm old enough to remember those days, but that's another story.

I'm really giving this rating for the coolness of the place. Rooftop patio, karaoke rooms, arcade...and stairs with the lyrics to Gin & Juice. I'm also old enough to remember when that was released. :D Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in at.. parking is easy right across the street.. friendly service and nice seating.. Food was great o had the street tacos and black bean soup.  It was very good.. Bartender makes me a drink because I couldn't find anything I liked.. very nice and friendly service .."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out after the hype that surrounded it.  It is a really neat concept with a lot of different things to do and a decent food/drink menu.  Unfortunately, our service was absolutely TERRIBLE.  And it takes a lot for me to say that because I work in the bartending/serving industry and I am extremely lenient when things go wrong since I understand from experience.

The couple my boyfriend and I were with ordered drinks that were supposed to be made with bourbon, but were made incorrect as vodka drinks and finally the server said she wouldn't do anything about it.  I'm a bartender, I know for a fact what bourbon tastes/smells like and that was definitely vodka being used instead of bourbon like it was supposed to be from the menu itself.  

The next fiasco was our food.  We ask for napkins and silverware BEFORE we order because there wasn't any at the table.  3 of us got food, and only 1 girl didn't.  The 3 of us start eating and our server is no where to be found... for 15-20 minutes.  We still had no napkins, no silverware, nothing!  Finally our server comes back after 15-20 minutes (FYI it was DEAD in there, so it wasn't a matter of being busy) and we ask again for napkins and silverware.  The girl without food STILL didn't have her food so again we are asking where it is, if we can have napkins, etc.  Server disappears yet again.  45 minutes later.  Still no napkins, no silverware, no food for the girl in our group.  We asked to speak to a manager because that is ridiculous...

The manager says they would put in an order for the girl...  45 minutes later... after we asked our server how many times now where the food is and after all of that repetition of asking she never even put the order in.  You'd think the manager would apologize for this, but he never did.  He said if she wanted it to go he'd put it in a box and that's it.  STILL NO NAPKINS OR SILVERWARE!  By the time the manager came over the rest of us were already done eating and after complaining about the service and the food/no silverware situation he throws a handful of BAR NAPKINS at me and walks away rolling his eyes!  I'm so sorry that I needed a napkin when I was eating my food, god forbid.

I was so disappointed in this place.  It is a great concept, but this was so unacceptable."}
{"text":"Punch Bowl Social is my favorite place in the flats. It is such a neat concept. The place is huge! There are multiple bars, upstairs and down, a dining area, and a gaming area complete with bowling alley. This is the kind of place you could stay all evening and not get bored.  Bring plenty of money, though. Their drink prices will rob you!!"}
{"text":"Love it here! It is the perfect addition to the flats! Building is huge, has two floors and three bars. Tons of activities to do like bowling, darts, shuffleboard, pool, ping-pong and video games also. Tons of TVs and is a great place to watch a game also!! Only complaint is that they need more bartenders on the weekends. It's pretty crowded and the bartenders are having a hard time keeping up- takes forever to get a drink. However the staff is super friendly and excited to be working. Have a DJ on the weekends and the music is always bumping. You should check it out!!"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance were spectacular. Some random guy did attempt the spike the punch bowl in a VERY social way. No fault of the restaurant but taste of Cleveland patrons gave us a great dinner and a show...unlike any have seen will see anytime in the future. Thank you Punch Bowl!"}
{"text":"there's video games, shuffleboard, bowling, pool, and tons more. there's even space outdoors for prime people watching. lots of people, but it wasn't packed to the point that you couldn't move.

drink prices aren't bad and their Mason Mule drink is tasty. 

this place is cavernous. I think you could legitimately lose somebody here. you might want to bring rope or breadcrumbs to find your way out."}
{"text":"Highly overrated. I could have overlooked our poor service if this place was more entertaining.  Apparently, asking to be sat near a T.V. Was a huge under taking ( there was only one other party on the dining room)  about 6 things to choose for lunch, and very poor service. Nothing special, nothing exciting. Witnessed two glasses being dropped. Watched 6 wait staff walk around the glass and completely ignored it. One shuffleboard, pool, ping pong table ($10 to rent).  wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Meh, was not impressed.  

Way too hipster, never seen so many buns and 'i cant change a tire, yet I still grow a beard' guys.  

Bathrooms?  Yeah enjoy your 5k walk to find them
Music?  Old school, but not like 'lets dance to this music' old school.  I appreciate a classic now and then, but if you are going to have a DJ, make sure they play music that has variety.
Drinks?  Ill say good, not priced well, but whatever
Arcade? , Plenty of games, but oh, even though you are drinking/eating and spending money here, we still charge you for games.  Hmm 16Bit seems to be free.

Anyways, its cool/huge building.  Part of the low rating is that I just cant stand hipster bars, something I did not know I was getting into when I went there."}
{"text":"This place is a cool c9ncept. I always love a night of karaoke but I never knew I needed my own room with a couch and friends. Definitely had the most fun in there karaoke rooms.

It's very very crowded on thurs Fri sat so wear flats.

Also unexpectedly they have real juice on the menu. I love the beet ginger and apple. Don't for get to stop in the photo booth to capture the night."}
{"text":"I came here with my grandmother for lunch a few weeks back. Among reading multiple negative reviews, our experience was quite the opposite. Our waiter (I'm not remembering what his name was), but he told us jokes, and was very plesant. Our experience in general was plesant. Food and drink was great. We didn't have the opportunity to play any games or bowl, but we were definitely impressed. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I think I entered Heaven!

I went in when it rained at the first Flats and if it had a pool table and maybe a hot tub...then you might as well give me a ticket to Heaven!

I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks like a great place!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. All of the reasons to come to this bar were closed off for private parties on a Saturday, poor planning on the part of the owner. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"Dang, Punch Bowl. I'm in the middle here. 

My first experiences at Punch Bowl Social literally blew me away. I was so pleased and so excited about this new edition to the Cleveland dining and entertainment scene, I was telling everyone to go. I went on weeknights, there were things to play, food and drink was served timely with a smile. I couldn't imagine why someone wouldn't want to come here to have fun. 

Then my sister's birthday happened. Or rather her decision to come here on a packed Saturday night for her birthday happened. 

Maybe this just isn't my scene--but is this not supposed to be restaurant with a bar and activities? Not on the weekend, apparently. I guess it's a club on the weekends. It felt like Barley House in the Flats. Saturday night greeted us pounding, loud music you have to scream over and a line to get inside that went around the building, complete with bouncers. And no, this line wasn't for getting in and playing games or, you know, going to Punch Bowl for the reasons it's Punch Bowl. It was a line to get into a \"nightclub\" with no direction or OBVIOUS option to go play games or do activities. Only to stand and drink and wait and scream over each other. Furthermore, I've been to some crowded Dave & Busters, casinos and other large activity-based venues--the environment at PBS on Saturday night wasn't one for playing games, I'll tell you that. 

It is so rare that I ever complain about getting drinks in a timely manner. But between the server, the bartender and the two hours we managed to stay there, we could only get one drink. The only way I can imagine getting drinks any faster would have been to place your next order as soon as you were given your drink. 

So--that probably seemed like a lot of complaining. I get it. It's the new Flats East Bank on a Saturday night. But no other venue down there was like this. Every other restaurant stuck to what they are, restaurants with bars. And no, I'm not an old cranky broad who can't handle crowds anymore. I would have expected long lines and club scenes from the dueling piano bar and FWD, but not from Punch Bowl. 

If this review speaks to you--then I suggest you go on weeknights. I think Punch Bowl still has a ton of potential on those nights and you can actually go and enjoy yourself. That is likely what I will stick to. And if you love Barley House, maybe try PBS on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I didn't plan on visiting Punch Bowl when I visited Cleveland but it was starting to rain when I was exploring downtown with my parents so this ended up being our hiding spot and it was really good for that, certainly served it's purpose but I'm not sure I would come back if I would have the chance. The service was lacking a bit. Had to get bartenders attention every time we wanted something, never checked on us even asking if we liked our appetizers... Not to mention there were a few dirty dishes on the the bar top from previous customers and they didn't bother to clean them the whole time we were there... but that's all just service I can say something bad about. The food was good and the beer selection great."}
{"text":"This place was saved from a 2 star review because of its atmosphere and unique concept.  I came here recently for brunch. Staff were friendly and we were seated promptly.  I like the variety in the seating (chairs and comfy booths).   I love how they have a variety of games from bowling to scrabble to private karaoke.  The food, however, was disappointing.  The biscuit was dry although the jam was delicious. My monkey bread french toast was not cooked thoroughly. They did bring out another once, but it seemed soggy.  My husband's burger was so so.  I love this new area in the flats and hope this place sticks around. But they need to up their game with the food so it's not just a bar spot."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of co-workers for a work trip.
We had a large group and ordered a private buffet dinner, which was yummy! Salads, mac and cheese, cheese and cracker platters, meat, potatoes.
We bowled and had drinks for a few hours - which was a lot nicer than just sitting at a table....
I think this place would be fun on a busy night, but it was still nice on a Tuesday night too."}
{"text":"First time at punch bowl. Ate in the diner and an awesome slasher named Adam served us dinner. Very attentive. Then we came over to the activities side and Hailey G helped us get some awesome drinks. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and service was horrible. No toilet paper in the bathroom and had to find a manager to get someone to take our food and drink order when rest of our party showed.   Too many other choices to hit at the East Bank of the flats... will not be back save your money and go elsewhere!!! Extremely disappointed in this experience."}
{"text":"Review based solely on entertainment factor:

Wow do I love this place. Like seriously, I love you Punchbowl. Maybe because I love games and there are SO many options here (bowling, karaoke, darts, shuffle board...there's more but I'm blanking). 

I would choose this place as thee place for group gatherings. Never had issues finding a table to sit and hello...entertainment! I loved their karaoke rooms but super tiny (with enough booze you won't mind, I promise). 

Never had problems with the drinks, although I primarily ordered beer. 

Servers were always nice, but the place can be packed so just a heads up. 

Also, parking is kinda difficult for free. You might luck out with local street parking or paying 10 bucks in the lot."}
{"text":"Awesome! Attended a birthday party for a friend last Saturday. Service was awesome, drinks were great! The atmosphere was great, we had a fun time bowling and playing pool! Perfect place for a party!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm in love with their steak salad and the chicken and cauliflower nachos but I also love going out here too."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day out of the blue. Great experience. At one point a gentleman who worked there came over to chat. I figured he was a server or bartender. Well after some recommendations and chatting about beer and spirits, it was the GM. Dennis was great...informative, positive, and that conversation left a lasting impression on us. We will certainly return after an interaction like that. This day and age, it's so great to have a chat with a GM, or any employee for that matter who has a pulse, is genuine, and whose priority is a good experience for patrons, and to make sure folks are happy, satisfied and comfortable. Kudos to that guy and that pace for making lunch an even more enjoyable experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time here and having excellent service JT, Sam and Eric are amazing. Sitting at the back bar. Had pimento cheese, the knock Jr. and the trout. Really good on all accounts. There was a snafu with the buns for the burger and JT made up for it without even asking. Pam seared trout on a corn, black eyed pea and poblano pepper mix. The trout was seated crispy enough to enjoy. Yummy."}
{"text":"We showed up right on time to our reservation and were greeted by a super friendly young lady. Showed us to our table and our server came right over. I think is name was Shane(?)--had a beard. I want to give this young man his credit because he was very helpful and had great suggestions. My boyfriend and I split their wings (YUM!) and then he ordered a burger and I got the grilled cheese. Both YUM. I have to say the homemade chips were also fantastic as is their housemade ranch dressing. My ONLY complaint.....no Miller Lite. Not sure how or why but they had Bud Light. Very cool place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here before, and have had a great time. There is tons to do, the drinks are great and it's got a great atmosphere. However, this time there were two private parties so my friends and I, who were there to celebrate a birthday, had no access to 1/3 of the first floor and the entire second floor. We decided to get a table on the first floor and ordered drinks, but seemed to piss off the server because we didn't order food. When we were done, the busser hovered over us with the bus tub while we were putting our coats on. I thought that was pretty rude. I have liked this place in the past, but would be reluctant to go back."}
{"text":"Giving the place 3 stars. Mainly because they charged me $10 for a shot of crown royale. So either they're wayyyy over priced or the barmaid ripped me off. And the drink I had before that tasted like it was missing the alcohol. The lobster roll was ok."}
{"text":"Love it! This was my first time in the Flats, and I've heard terrible things about it for many years but was pleasantly surprised when I saw Punch Bowl. My friends were staying at the Aloft hotel across the street, so I first saw Punch Bowl from there and thought wow, that place is HUGE. I quickly texted my resident Cleveland expert friend who told us to try it for dinner. And I was impressed! I have the buttermilk chicken sandwich, and it was great! Perfectly cooked, not dry, and had a cool \"white BBQ sauce\" for dipping. We also ordered the black eyed pea hummus for the table which was very unique and had good flavor. 
We did not venture to try any of the actual \"punch bowls\" but I had a few Moscow Mules which were good quality. After dinner, we wandered around the 2-story building, which has a warehouse/old school diner kind of feel in my opinion. They have ALL of the activities you could ever want. Old school arcade games, bowling, karaoke rooms, Foosball, ping pong, anything you can imagine! It's like an adult Chuck-e-Cheese. I will say that the attire of some of the clientele was very odd, like women seemed dressed up like they were going to a club rather than an outfit you would wear bowling, but maybe that's just a Cleveland thing.
Another bonus is that the Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville is opening right across the street this spring, so there will be even more to do in that small area! The flats are definitely up and coming, and I hope it continues to expand in the coming years. It is a great tourist attraction for Cleveland, and close enough to the Browns stadium to stop for a meal/drink before a game."}
{"text":"Awesome place for friends and family to gather. Gaames, bowling, and karaoke all in one place. I enjoyed myself very well. Also had a drink called the mer-man freaking awesome"}
{"text":"The morons at punchbowl social decided it would be a good idea to schedule two private parties on a busy Saturday night and shut down the game room, large bar area, and the main bathrooms. Our experience was absolutely disturbing. The wait for the two coed single bathrooms was at least 20 minutes at any given time. The one small bar area available to get a drink was worse than the line for the bathroom, which was ran by one space cadet bartender. I hope they get their shit together soon."}
{"text":"Great place but bartending staff leaves a lot to be desired. There aren't enough of them on a Saturday night to fulfill the amount of people there."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends. The place has exceptionally friendly bartenders. Lots of arcade games to play and pool and shuffle board. Good music too!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. The drinks and service were awesome. Definitely coming soon!!! The manager, Rob, stopped by our table after our server told him it was my friend's birthday and brought her some mini cupcakes! It was a nice touch and proves the staff takes care of all their guests!"}
{"text":"The NICEST people ever. Goes to show you how good managers and good training makes for a good experience. The drinks are unique and delicious. Most interesting mixed drinks I've had in a long time. Fun atmosphere!."}
{"text":"First time here was on a Saturday night and I have to say I am a fan. There was a ton going on for this guy.... From bowling to ping pong (LEGENDARY PLAYER) to video games, darts, shuffleboard, billiards, and food for when I achieved my buzz from the scotches and craved a tasty dish.... I will be back for sure during the week, when I will be able to hop on more activities as I will say Saturday night was pretty packed.. 

Check it out CLE peeps as this place has some serious fun to be had.... :-)"}
{"text":"We went on opening weekend. Which I was prepared for it to be crazy. I fancy myself a advanced sophisticated consumer (probably not as sophisticated as I think) now and not just a frat boy looking to get drunk and chase girls anymore, but this place appears to be good for either group. There was a very nice dining area, and active bars all over the place. 

To me the vibe was good and the service was amazing from the two servers we had while we were there. The specialty drinks were not as good as I was hoping but when you are in the same town as Velvet Tango Room and Society it makes it hard to stand out. 

I am sure the target audience for this place is about 10 years younger than me, but I was thoroughly impressed and jealous this was not around in my heyday. I may never make it back there but if you are looking for eatertainment then this is one of the places you need to check out.

Oh yeah and it should be noted it beats the hell out of the Beach Club which used to rest somewhat in the general neighborhood of this place. Shout out to my Generation Xers!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to the airport to kill some time.  Thought we would take our son to the arcade while the husband and I enjoyed some light lunch and cocktail.  

It was during the daytime, so not a lot of patrons at the time.  I love the concept of \"play\" and dining.   A couple of bowling lanes, nooks for gathering by a fireplace, a half dozen or so video games and a beautifully designed bar. 

I had the bloody mary bar, however, was unimpressed with it as we visited during the tail end of the hour.  The garnishes were picked through and not refilled.  Somehow I mustered enough of the leftover \"bar\" to make a somewhat decent Mary...

My lobster topped fries were decadent and i barely made a dent in it~.  My husband had the burger and he was very happy with it."}
{"text":"Yuck! Menu sucks and food is gross. Service is good tho. They really need to rethink the menu. The ribs taste like SPAM and that weird Chicken and waffle thing was the most disgusting thing I've ever encountered... have the wings if your in a crunch and at a work or social dinner."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Cleveland, first restaurant too, and I am very pleased! Ordered a brat thinking it would come on a bun but was surprised by a brat on a bed of mashed potatoes, slaw, with mustard seed and apple slices. And I was so not mad about it! It was delicious, 10/10 on flavors. And really friendly service too! Will return if ever back in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Very good bar at end of Staff fantastic food great bourbon selection great tequila selection and I can't say anything bad about this place"}
{"text":"Visited last weekend for the start of an evening out with a plan to hop locations throughout town. Punch Bowl is aiming to be a social destination point. We were in about 6:00pm and it was already filling up and loud with activity. 

The building is long and narrow and broken up in to several different areas. The decor is a blend of industrial and elegance. We sat in the restaurant, but explored the other social settings. Down from the restaurant was another bar and then some different conversation seating areas. Go even further and you'll find bowling lanes and arcade games. There is also an upstairs that can be reserved for private parties. 

The menu was tempting and hard to choose what to try. The ingredients are fresh and focused on natural and locally sourced. I am always a fan of that. We settled on multiple appetizers since it was the beginning of a long evening and enjoyed each and our drinks. 

The service was very attentive and laid back. Everything looked clean including the restrooms. Don't come here expecting an intimate gathering. It's going to be loud and there's just a lot happening... lots of hustle and bustle. I'd like to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Really love this place! It is not just a typical 'bar'. This place has a bowling alley, a karaoke area, arcade, outdoor bar, restaurant seating and bar seating. The food was delicious, even though I just got the cauliflower nachos..they were amazing and enough to share! The service was great and the room is very spacious. Only downside was $10 parking, really wish every state had something like this! It is great for kids, teens and adults!"}
{"text":"Super bummed. I've never actually been here and was really looking forward to hosting a Birthday party here. 
I called about 2 weeks ago to make reservations. The party was for 22 people. When I made the reservations, the young lady on the phone took them and said someone would be calling me back. 
I waited and waited. Finally after a week, I called them back and spoke to a host. Apparently they never had me down because my party was too big and didn't have the audacity to call me and tell me. So, come March 4th me and my 21 guests would have showed up and would have been turned away. What kind of service is that?
I asked if I could make reservations,  she took my name and number down and called me back and said NO. I could come in but wouldn't be guaranteed a table. Really? With reservations 3 weeks in advanced, I wouldn't be guaranteed a table? Plus, no one ever called me back to tell me this. Now, because of the late notice. I have to host the party at my house. Thanks punch bowl!"}
{"text":"The wings here are to die for!! Great service too! Drinks were on point! Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Victoria was our waitress and she was phenomenal! She has a great attitude and a beautiful smiling face. We had a party of 18 and she took care of all of our needs with no problems whatsoever! She was there to make sure we were completely satisfied and we were! The food and drinks were delicious and everything was served in a timely manner! Thank you, Victoria, for your outstanding service!!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible but the drinks was good. My pork taco was dry and not season.  I just know not to get the tacos again. I did tip good."}
{"text":"Jenn the waitress was great. She was very attentive and helpful. She had a wonderful knowledge of the menu, sauces and desserts. Her personality was refreshing. She did a fantastic job!!! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot to do a lot of activities. We didn't eat here, just came here to bowl and have a drink. Drinks were okay. Bowling was fun for such a small place. 3 stars because of the 20 minute wait to get shoes for bowling. The place was pretty much empty but the shoe rental person was no where to be found."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Long wait time for food even with reservations. Super expensive food but was good food not gonna lie, get the quesadillas!! Don't expect to do much during the day, they allow parties to rent out sections including all that is inside such as the video games, bowling lanes, shuffle boards, ping pong games."}
{"text":"What a great addition to CLE!! We stayed all night long! We started off in the \"diner\" for dinner, I had the American burger with bacon jam (soooo tasty!!), the lady had the Steak salad, both were delicious and priced well. We ventured from there to the upstairs bar and played ping pong. Their beer selection is outstanding but I can't wait to try their cocktails and go bowling on my next visit."}
{"text":"Mike was a great server. Fast service and great recommendations. The rooftop has an awesome view. Good beer selection and lots of things to do. Thanks again Mike!"}
{"text":"Great bar scene, good cocktails, expensive (new DT place in the hippest new spot, what do you expect?) and HUGE space.  I like the idea of all of their games, but as I am usually there on the weekends, getting a spot on one of the few pool tables, billiard spots, or roughly 8 bowling lanes seems a little daunting with the crowded bar scene, despite all the space.   Its still a cool background thing going on to keep it interesting.

If you like Alcohol in your dessert, some of their spiked float creations are crazy good, the Mix-Ologist with mint in it is stupid delicious."}
{"text":"Great place with reasonable drinks and food prices. The burger that I ordered was very good!! The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after a Christmas party across the way.  Looks like every other place that has opened in Cleveland in the past 3 yrs.  Unoriginal beers and bartenders who were indifferent.  Didn't eat and didn't bowl.  So, our new Cleveland hotspot (Flats) is chain places with the same bartenders the Flats head years ago (In terms of service) and all look the same?  Makes us look like schmucks if ya ask me.  Also, if your going to charge me the prices they are the bartender can at least say \"hello\", smile or tell me to piss off...either one would at least be somewhat social...."}
{"text":"Super fun vibe here.  All the pretty people are here and they're here to party man.  Games are fun and drinks are cold.   Probably the hottest new spot in Cleveland. Go before it gets played out!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service.  Unique menu and awesome drink list, huge patio to people watch on a sunny Saturday.  New rooftop patio is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday after a wedding. We were part of a large contingency that didn't have a reservation. That being said, service was incredibly slow, it took over an hour to get our food, and we had to ask for our drinks multiple times. When we talked to a manager he was far from apologetic, instead he was combative. \"He accommodated us, and that's not how he normally runs his restaurant, and that he wouldn't seat a large group without a reservation in the future.\" Food was decent when we received it, and clearly the staff wasn't prepared for a large group, but the lack of empathy by management was preposterous. Best of luck in the future, I hope you don't treat other paying customers the way we were treated."}
{"text":"I almost don't wanna share this review, in fear you'll never leave me a free \"free\" parking spot! If you're looking for food and fun, come here!

I've been here several times and would go again any time. Always good food, good service and a fun, good experience. I love the industrial, modern vintage decor and the up-beat, fun atmosphere. The Punch is strong and the social gets a little hard as it's loud with people having fun. But, you must wander around, explore, take in the views and play a few games. You'll just have fun!

p.s. being a former small town girl, I miss more \"free\" parking spots!"}
{"text":"Fun fun fun! Came last night for drinks, a couple
Board games and bowling. Our entire experience was superb - staff was super friendly, bartenders were patient and knowledgeable (I had a lot of questions about the beers) and the server who took care of us in our bowling lane was friendly and attentive. Looking forward to going back and trying out the menu. My new favorite spot in CLE is PBS!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and I'm so happy they recently opened in Cleveland. I've been here a couple times so far and had a great time. They have an awesome and friendly staff! I like the extensive drink menu and enjoyed their shrubbery punch. They also make a mean Moscow mule!

They offer a lot of fun activities and the place is huge! I highly recommend the karaoke rooms. They are $35 an hour which is not bad at all especially if you split it with friends. Bowling and ping pong is really fun too. Can't say a bad thing about it. Check it out for yourself :)"}
{"text":"Good food and good times. In town on business and my coworker and I decided to venture out on this rainy evening. We were pleasantly surprised with this Gastropub  and had a great time. Between my coworker flirting with the waiter and the excellent food I hand evening that was great. Would definitely come again if I am ever in Cleveland. The Cubano was delicious"}
{"text":"Great place for some good drinks, food, fun and football! My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday during their happy hour time and had a great time. Their tacos are delicious as well as their chicken wings!! After grabbing some drinks and food at the bar we went bowling and ordered more drinks. Definitely recommend this place for a good time."}
{"text":"Apparently this isn't a happenin' lunch spot? 

I dropped by with some coworkers on a rainy Wednesday and the place was dead. DEAD. Our server (Marcus, I think?) was nice and offered a lot of suggestions on what to order. 

I started out with a carrot juice and then followed that up with a carrot salad. The carrot salad was supposed to be roasted carrots and avocado but there were about 3 pieces of avocado and the carrots weren't really cooked. I crunched away on my carrots while most of my coworkers enjoyed their food. I heard the grilled cheese was tasty and someone was a fan of a Cuban. One person had to have her burger remade 3 times and that was more than a little annoying. I would have expected the manager to come over and apologize, but...nope. 

I like the concept of this place but the food was a little underwhelming to me. I think if I come back, I'll stick to drinks."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad but quite possibly the worst service I ever had. Plates were dirty. We received warm water with no ice. The table next to us all had ice in their pitcher and glasses. Prob won't come back to eat."}
{"text":"Hailey with the cats ears was super knowledgeable about the beer and very quick to refill my beer. Even with our giant company party in full swing."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out after work with lots of things to do"}
{"text":"When you won't let your patrons back in while their cab gets lost in less than 20 degree weather you lose with me. Bye punch bowl. Threatened to call the police on me for asking to come in. Snuck in a side door. I hated you before and I definitely hate you now. THREATENED TO GET THE POLICE WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A RIDE HOME. Dramatic. 

Positives:
I think punch bowl would be fun early in the night when you have the opportunity to play the games. It's large and similarly priced as other bars. 

Unfortunately after tonight I've had my last straw. I usually come when friends want to go but now I'm done."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. 
Went here for lunch yesterday. The food was good. I ordered A burger with a Caesar salad. The comeback sauce that came with the burger was amazing, and the burger was delicious.

However, My server did not seem to know anything about the menu. From not knowing the salad dressings or if they served breakfast all day or not. My sister had first ordered the monkey bread French toast, then our server came over and informed us that we could not get a breakfast item. My server forgot I ordered a salad I had to remind her when she brought our food. By the time she had came over and asked how our food was we were ready for boxes. 

I will come back, but hope to have better service. Every one has bad days!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Was so pumped to bring my friend here for the first time today. We all manage restaurants, so we were patient. But... 

1 Your hostesses have no idea what's going on 
2. Your bartender just got yelled at we heard after he treated us like an inconvenience for sitting at the bar. 
3 We sat at a table for the past 25 minutes before we went to the bar and no one acknowledged we existed. I know it's Labor Day, but get it together. 

This is an awesome place, but the way it was managed today was embarrassing and as we make our way around the flats today I am embarrassed for this establishment."}
{"text":"My first Punch Bowl experience was lackluster. Maybe it was because I was so hungry when we arrived, and it was a very long wait... or maybe it was because there wasn't a great variety of eats on the menu... or it was the very long bathroom line. Or possibly, it was a combination of all of the above that led to my 2 star rating. I doubt we'd go back, but if we do: it would be for drinks and games only. The blueberry lemonade is what made this a 2 star rating, instead of just a 1 star, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"First things first... my waitress Charisse was freakin amazing!!! Hands down one of the best servers ever!!! Literally!   It was my first time there and she made me feel welcome and took the time to explain the whole concept to me.   This place is pretty cool

PROS: 
-the atmosphere is amazing.  Whoever decorated this place is great at what they do.
-it definitely lives up to its name.   
-great drinks ( I had a signature punch)
- friendly staff
- fries were great, and the sauce with my chicken wings was perfect
- great addition to the flats

NEGS:
-  I wasn't a huge fan of my burger.  I've traveled the world and tried some of the best burgers, and the Knock off burger got knocked out.   It was bland, it was missing flavor,  I got creative and mixed ketchup and mustard and a little bit of the left over ranch from my chicken wings and it went down perfectly ( hey maybe this should be a signature sauce lol) But the fries that they served were great ( also dipped in the leftover ranch )

-I wish they had a spare iPhone charger.  I wanted to take some pics of the place because it was too beautiful not to capture but my phone died right when I sat down

-------------------------

Overall was a great experience and will be definitely coming back.  Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is SO MUCH FUN! My friend and I are from out of town (San Diego) and were blown away by how much there was to do here. We went for a casual drink or two on a Friday around one so it wasn't crowded yet, but we could tell this was the place to be for happy hour and nightlife. I forget out bartender's name but he was SO friendly and nice. Really sweet guy and the punch drinks he made us were bomb. Working in the service industry myself, I really appreciated his great service, and he also let us sample a new grapefruit vodka they have in house. I will be going to Punch Bowl Social a ton as soon as it opens in San Diego!"}
{"text":"Rudest staff ever....  our work hosted a Christmas party and it was the worst food & bar staff they treated people so bad we had our party there 2 years in a row we will not be back!  With a $13,000 bill you think they be a lot more respectful."}
{"text":"GREAT place!! Memorable, tones of fun options!!Cavan the manager took great care in making sure things were right and fun was had. Evan the chief was great!! Must visit!!"}
{"text":"A varitable warehouse of Fun, Punch Bowl Social is sprawling and loud, with multiple bars and a dizzying array of leisure sports to engage in. One imagines a grumpy David Foster Wallace equating its aim of providing American Enjoyment! to the persistent, creepy reminders of good cheer on that infamous cruise ship. Decorwise, you get the typical mix of brutalist concrete and exposed ductwork, with some neon, and incongruous portraits of nineteenth century hunting parties spread along most of the walls, for whatever reason. The other day, patrons enjoyed bowling ($10.50 per player per hour) in one compartment of this crazy, sterile Fun ship. Bowlers wear Velcro shoes, the overlords of PBS having dispensed with those pesky laces, a design choice which admittedly begs the question, \"Why didn't somebody think of this years ago?\" The weird part about the lanes is that the pins are on wires, meaning that near collisions with the ball sometimes don't result in strikes as they should, frustrating some participants. Even still, PBS succeeds in providing a Big Fun! atmosphere at the cost of intimacy or uniqueness (those strange hunting parties, notwithstanding). Bring your biggest smile and money for Budweiser (or should we say, America, these days) and prepare to party like it's 1999, albeit with more selfies."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, rude waiters and management. We orders 4 burgers and two bottles of wine. They lost our food ticket and did not make our food till I went to track down the general manager to ask him where our food was. Our waiter was missing the whole time. Oh and about the bottles of wine they didn't come. This place is literally chucky cheese for adults. Never again..."}
{"text":"When I was at Punch Bowl last night Veronica was extremely friendly and helpful! She provided great customer service and was very eager to help my friend find a lost wallet."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I HATE going out more than almost anything in the whole world. Even for notorious introverts, Punch Bowl Social is a great time! Bartenders make awesome drinks, and you can get super drunk playing skee-ball and not talking to anyone. If you decide you like people that day, they also have pool, bowling, and other good group games. Super cool atmosphere unlike any other bar makes for an awesome night out!"}
{"text":"This place is like the adult hang out place!! They have bowling alleys, a photo booth, karaoke, an arcade with old school games, and drinks galore!! There is an upstairs to this place but we were able to go up there at the time because there was a private party.

Anyway, service wasn't so fast in the dining area on a Thursday night, so my husband, friend, and I decided to sit at the bar to drink and eat.  The service was faster at the bar and it was amazing how attentive the bartender was to us along with everyone at the bar!  She made the most amazing mason mule I have ever tasted! Her drinks were all consistent and delicious!  We also ordered salad and fries which was pretty good but I didn't know they put bleu cheese in the salad, which I'm not a fan of, so it was not to my liking.  The service was amazing at the bar though so I really don't have any complaints.  I truly love this place and can't wait to go back to actually play the video games while I drink!"}
{"text":"I was here at punchbowl this past thursday and let me tell you this place is awesome. Especially Joel the bartender he made our experience one to remember."}
{"text":"Great  place with wacky/surprising Sunday Brunch.  Flavorful, casual upscale warehouse look with exposed pipes and very high ceilings.  It's well appointed and vast, not the cozy feel.   Food: had burgers, Gordon blue sandwich, biscuits and gravy and some cocktails...all solid, nothing to write home about, so I guess I'll stop writing...if you're looking easy going, can't go wrong..."}
{"text":"We visited the Punch Bowl on a Wednesday evening and had a blast! The food and service was incredible. We were greeted by a wonderful server named Hailey (who was wearing cat ears). I choose to eat vegan and always have to ask questions about the menu and ingredients, she was very knowledgable and able to suggest items on the menu that were all super tasty (chips & salsa, avocado and carrot salad, mushroom tacos). I personally love how spacious the restaurant is. I was able to plug in my laptop, log onto their free WiFi and work with my client while we ate. They also have have new pinball machines!!!"}
{"text":"I go to Punch Bowl pretty often to drink.  It can get expensive but is fun with a large group since the place is so big.  This review is mostly for the food, which I had for the first time in Cleveland yesterday.  I used to live in Denver where they have a Punch Bowl and ate there a few times.  I remember the menu being huge and all the food was good.  Unfortunately I can't say the same for the Cleveland location.  The menu seemed small and they still had breakfast items despite it being almost 3 pm.  They had a small selection of appetizers, a few salads, a few sandwiches.  Nothing seemed to be that great.  I got a salad and it was okay.  For 13$ I would expect it to be amazing, but it wasn't.  The dressing was supposed to be mixed in but was basically just on the lettuce and none of the other salad toppings.  I also had to load it with pepper to give it some flavor.  Probably won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff greeted us and sat us right away. Our server, Ashley Mack, was amazing!! She was very knowledgeable and gave her honest opinions when we asked, which I greatly appreciate. Our food was delicious. Very fun establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The service is always awesome.  Today I went for brunch and to watch a little bit of the game.  I had the chicken and waffles and they were awesome!  They have multiple TVs so you can see any local team game from any spot.  They do not have the NFL ticket.   Nonetheless, it's still a good time for family, dates, catching up with friends.

P.s.  I cane for the food, but the games (arcade, bowling, ping pong, shuffleboard, darts, etc.) are always open."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were amazing! Service was great despite being busy and we enjoyed the rooftop bar overlook!"}
{"text":"This is a creative concept and really fun spot. The crowds are nothing compared to what this type of place would have in a bigger city. You can enter for free, eat in the diner, hang out at the bar, or enjoy the 2 floors of games and activities. There is a karaoke room, arcade, bowling, and more. Very casual vibe and good for groups."}
{"text":"Witnessed an employee banging on a restroom door that was occupied. When the person in the restroom responded \"someone's in here\" the employee continued banging and said \"I'm about to f*** some b***hes up\". I believe the people in the restroom asked for manager so I'm not sure what happened. But after witnessing that I will not be giving this place ANY business. Plenty of other places in the flats that treat customers professionally."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! Now that it's summer, they opened up their own rooftop which has an amazing view of the city. I got two of the apps (they don't have everything downstairs). And the shrimp tacos were too spicy for my taste(might have ate too many chili peppers!) Patrick, who was super came around and asked how everything was going. I love going to this place because it's a great place for a Friday or Saturday night! (Need to add chips and guacamole to the menu upstairs!) I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to come and eat and play. My favorite waitresses are Brittany and Hailey with the cat ears. Both have given me fabulous customer service experience and my food always came out quickly!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They've three floors, the main level, 2nd floor has pool and ping pong and 3rd level is the rooftop with a fireplace and bar. Their food has been awesome so far! Brunch/lunch and dinner.. of course tons of food options and drink menu.. the staff has been friendly and very helpful. They also have freshly squeezed juices like beet and carrots.. love this place."}
{"text":"Love the rooftop here! It's very busy on Saturday nights (to be expected) but once you're inside there is plenty of room to walk around, socialize and drink. Definitely one of my favorite spots in the flats to grab cocktails!"}
{"text":"One of the best bars in the Cleveland. It is huge and has a lot to do. Just make sure you go to the right bartender, other wise your drink might not taste good."}
{"text":"Jon was my bartender tonight ! The service was by far the best service I've ever had. He mixed humor with great drinks !"}
{"text":"I need to come back and really dig through the place as I was pretty smashed when we came here, but it seemed really nice. Great addition to the flats."}
{"text":"A fun place to go with groups! The rooftop bar offers great views, but fills up quickly so don't expect to get in immediately later in the evening- usually after 11:30pm on the weekends it is full pending nice weather. 

There are multiple bars here, so if one is crowded, you can try your luck at another one. I've never had the food here, but rather come for drinks. My only complaint is that I always get the same drink and it is always a different price, like $3 different. So Punch Bowl, how much is an absolut dirty martini? I've been charged $8 and $11 in the same night for the same drink at different bars on three separate occasions. I'm either getting a good deal or overcharged, but either way the bartenders need to know your pricing. 
Next visit I do want to try the punch bowl drinks on their menu that everyone raves about, so this review is to be continued!"}
{"text":"We had so much fun playing scrabble and eating yummy food and enjoying the delicious cucumber cocktail. Hailey our server was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"As a visitor from out of state, my group of coworkers were looking for something that everyone would enjoy in Cleveland. We decided on the Punch Bowl. We arrived on a Thursday evening around 8pm and had trouble finding a table in the normal seating area for our party of 9. We easily found a long skinny hightop near the bowling lanes in the far back room with no wait. Our waiter was absolutely fantastic and extremely accurate despite our table size and our wandering crowd of guests. 

FOOD & DRINK: The menu is amazing, especially the eclectic food choices. I opted for the Superfood Grain Bowl ($12) which had quinoa/crunchy farro, kale, radishes, carrots, sprouts, chiles, mushrooms and a poached egg. I must say...this was the best dish I ate in Cleveland! So flavorful and interesting in texture. I did add some house hot sauce for a kick, but it was such a complex bowl of awesomeness!! My coworker ate my next choice which was the Fra' Mani Fried Bologna. Also amazing according to his taste buds. The Chips and Dip were outstanding with really tasty crispy chips and flavorful onion dip. I wish I could have tried more on the menu here. Delightful concoctions. The drinks were equally awesome. My first drink was their famous Beets Me. YUM!! Next, I had the Orchard and Oak which was a witty mix of Crispin Cider and Watershed Bourbon. I approve!!

There is so much to do here! Bowling, darts, shuffleboard, pool tables, karaoke, food, drink, dancing, chillaxin. All the things! Whether you are out with coworkers or looking for an awesome date night, this place has it all! Parking is easy across the street ($10) or along side streets if you can find a spot. I will be back here next time I hit Cleveland."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 9 around noon on a Saturday. We were seated as soon as they moved some tables together for us. Maleah was our server and she was absolutely fantastic! Thank you Maleah! The food and drinks were great as well."}
{"text":"Want a night out on the town? If yes, this is the one stop shop. This is a huge bar that has many different areas to it. You can bowl, shuffleboard, play pool or even rent a private karaoke room!

The bar gets very busy, but it has a mixture of just about everyone. Defiantly a cool place if you are looking for some drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing! We were in town from Baltimore and tried this place for lunch. So good it was the best decision! You get 2 free biscuits before your food comes out. The sodas were to die for, burger was delicious and yogurt with granola. You must go!!"}
{"text":"This place is huge and unorganized. We walked over from the rock n roll hall of fame and got a great little tour of the city. Happy hour is from 3-6pm. Our menus had miller high life on it for $2.50. When our server was leaving she just brought us the receipt for the credit card only (you have to put one in the system). 

I had to ask her 3 times for the itemized one. She didn't seem to get it. Brings me the itemized one and it is $10 less than what the credit card one showed. Took her 20 minutes to get me the itemized receipt and they had charged us wrong. They finally fixed it. They had changed their menu and/ or pricing and somehow we got an old menu. Was gonna take a picture to show here but they took it from me and ripped it up. Our friends had the same thing happen to them were they just gave the credit card receipt and not an itemized. I would suggest paying close attention to your shady server at this place.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for the group that isn't sure what they want to do.  They offer bowling, shuffleboard, karaoke and then some all in the same building.  It is basically a one stop shop for your food/drink/entertainment needs.

Food/Drink: The drink and food options and quality are what you would expect of a spot located in the newly revamped Eastbank of the Flats.  You won't be disappointed. Tip: Try an adult milkshake

Entertainment: One word....KARAOKE!!  I love karaoke...but imagine a room with a couch friends and the best acoustics.  I mean you sound just like Carrie Underwood.  It's 25$ for a hour for up to 4 people.  It's a great option for your shy friends who prefer their karaoke a bit more private.

The staff was wonderful and attentive.  It's not just a bar....it is the Punchbowl Experience.

Tip:  Super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights...plan ahead.  Did I mention there is a DJ?"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place, but I definitely would NOT eat there again. Went for lunch on Memorial Day, we were seated around 12:30 and the place was pretty empty. After the holiday weekend our server said they were all out of a number of things on the menu. Not to mention napkins, so we had to use bar napkins. The menu was limited to begin with so running out of things made it worse. What they did have was not very good. I got The Georgia Crisp - a fried chicken sandwich missing the chicken. The rest of the table got burgers and no one cared too much for them. The service was very slow and the food took 45 minutes to arrive. With a place that large they should incorporate more food and beverage runners. That would speed things up. A cool place to hang out and drink, just don't plan on eating there especially after a holiday weekend."}
{"text":"Ate here with spouse and two friends after a Cavs playoff game on a Rainy Sunday evening. Location is great at the Flats, but $10 to park unless you live in the building. Not very busy, maybe at 30% capacity. We are seated immediately by friendly hostess. Then we wait. 
Atmosphere is nice, fun. We are in the dining portion of the restaurant but bowling and other fun is right down the hall. 
Clueless server helps us. She can't answer our questions (what is matcha lemonade) and told us that \"comeback sauce\" is basically like a McDonalds Big Mac. Hmmm. 
Great beer selection and beer was good. We are ready to order. We wait for our beverages. Another server comes. He gives us the same answers as our first server. Then he agreed to take our food order but, lacking paper, he writes on his hand. We order. 
Time to receive food was fine. 
Spouse and I order Impossible Burger, which is good not great. We have had this in DC at Founding Farmers and it was first rate, here it was good. One guy had a beautiful Cobb salad which was delicious, and one had chicken pot pie which also was good. 
As we were talking, having all but finished eating, some guy approached our table and stands and stares. I acknowledge him and return to our conversation. He keeps standing and staring. My friend asks if we can help him. He says he's wondering if he should clear our dishes. Odd.  So he works there? We give him some dishes and he goes away. Bizarre. Not first rate service. 
My evaluation: service 2, location 3, atmosphere 4, food 3.5, value 3, for a 3 overall. I'd go to Collision Bend Brewery next time."}
{"text":"Best clean healthy food and awesome staff on the east bank. You can spend all day there and have a blast!!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back because of the cool concept, but the service is just beyond terrible.  The food isn't too bad, so that is a plus, and it is super fun, but service is so stinken slow, even when they aren't busy.  We sat right by the bar this last time,  and there was a total of maybe 25 people in the whole place, and we still found ourselves pre-ordering and double-ordering so we wouldn't be sitting empty handed.  The kitchen wasn't too much faster either, but I will say, the chili was amazing."}
{"text":"We recently made a trip down to the East Bank to see how it was coming back. Reasonable valet made parking easy, $10. We didn't have a reservation and it was Sweetest Day so they politely explained we could sit at the self seating or one of the bars. Upstairs was a bit loud as there was a large group watching the ALCS and the ceiling is pretty low. We thought it would be more fun to come back with a group and play all the games. We weren't real impressed with the menu, so we just got a drink and went to dinner at a nearby place that was more upscale. I like that this place offers a fun vibe and different activities from the other places in the Flats but on this night we weren't looking to bowl or play ping pong. We did use the photo booth though which was fun."}
{"text":"We came here during Taste Of Summer, and even with the crowds we had great service. Hailey was super attentive despite having a million other people to also check on - when our food came late, she consistently checked on us until it came out. The food was delicious and the great service only made it that much better!"}
{"text":"Fun place to hangout and play games and bowl but food is average at best. Definitely not a dining destination"}
{"text":"ugh i am just disgusted with this place. this was my second time going here, so i figured i would give it another shot.. no. it still was so disappointing. the service here is TERRIBLE. took 45 min for chips and salsa to come out!! over a half hour for 5 drinks to come out.. and it wasn't even that busy. our server was very out of it, almost as if she was drunk or high. not to mention the girls bathroom was a complete and disgusting mess BOTH times i was there. i do not recommend this place. the staff was very rude, everyone was very unhappy to help and looked very unhappy to work there."}
{"text":"If you are a game loving, food and or beer drinking persons check out this fun place on the East Bank of the Flats under the red 'East Bank' sign. Punch Bowl has a funatmosphere that all should go check out! Whether you're into shuffle boarding, bowling, playing fun games, karaoke, or just hanging out with friends in a fun place, this is where you need to go!

They have four different bars, 3 down and 1 upstairs which can be accessed by both stairs and an elevator. I highly suggest using the bathroom in the far back left when you enter through the main doors, hint:no one knows it's here :) The dining area is only on the first floor, which is nice.

There are also a wide range of drinks for everyone and a simplistic food menu for all to enjoy. On the weekends, it can be very crowded, which makes it hard to move around.

I have been here both with friends and for a Howard Hanna function and had so much fun every time!"}
{"text":"Headed to Punch Bowl tonight for their grand opening party and it was absolutely lovely. They had offered me two tickets to come to the VIP sneak peek. This included unlimited drinks, unlimited bowling/games and a good selection of food from 7-9pm. Anyone could buy a ticket for $10 for a similar option. 

Wow, what a great time exploring this new 27,000 square foot venue.

Their drink called something something shrubbery was terrific. I have also been on a mojito kick and those did not disappoint either. 

Bowling was fun. The lanes are brand new and nice. One thing I noticed was hat there wasn't the air that normally blows on your hand so professional bowlers might be disappointed.

My friends got a good game of ping pong going and seemed to have a great time. 

I played some of the arcade games including 4 person PacMan, skew ball, and pin ball machines.

The food was great - they had little stations set up all over the places with tons of food and it was full all night. My favorites included the Devils on horseback,  stuffed mushrooms and some sort of crostini with goat cheese. There wasn't anything that wasn't good.

I definitely plan to come back and bring a lot more people to see it."}
{"text":"Overpriced hamburger served with cold French fries and they place was out of ketchup. Are you kidding me? Made a mistake coming here and hopefully you can learn from me."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a few drinks, it was pretty full and quite busy so it took a while for us to order and get our drinks. I got a strawberry daiquiri and my friend got some merman cocktail. There wasn't much alcohol in either of our drinks. Seemed like a casual place to hang and play games, they had a bunch of arcade-type games. Also a rooftop bar area."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials, arcade games, bowling, fun promotions...what more could I want? The St. Louis ribs here are so tasty and our server Tamara was EXCELLENT and very friendly. Definitely recommend for a Saturday all day fun group stop or even just for a date."}
{"text":"I would rather give NO stars. The worse choice in the flats! Bad food. Bad service. I wish I didn't have to pay this bill. Still hungry and will go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We visited a few places on the east bank of the flats on a recent Friday night and fun was had by all.  Punch Bowl was our 2nd stop of the evening and we had a blast.  The drinks were delicious, especially the mojitos and blueberry lemonade.  We didn't have to wait long for drinks either.  The bartenders were fast and professional.  I didn't get a chance to try any food, but I am looking forward to a return visit to do so.

We played scrabble men vs women for about an hour, which was fun.  The ladies ended up winning, but we vowed revenge.  This place has a lot of interesting and fun things to do like play scrabble, chess, darts, ping pong, bowling (six lanes!), food, and drink.  

It attracts a younger 20-something crowd, but that didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves.  I really like how the east bank of the flats has come to life and this spacious bar certainly adds value.

Fun!"}
{"text":"Best service! My server name was Jenna, she was soo warm and inviting. Her knowledge of the menu was impeccable, and the dish she recommended was amazing. I would definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"So the reason for the low review is the cons out weigh the pros. I've been here on a Saturday night when it's supposed to be the coolest new place to be and on a week day for lunch. On the Saturday it was extremely packed and to get a drink is almost impossible. But then we did get drinks and I'm not kidding when I tell you the size of the drink my friend got was the same as a drink emoji. If emojis were real life, the tiniest glass I have ever seen. I thought it was funny she did not. There's just too many people, too hard to get a drink and really not that fun. Which is too bad bc I wanted to like it. As for the lunch I had there was just mediocre nothing to come back for and the best part of the drinks that day were the names. Just not that impressed. Pros of this place is that it is a big place, cool things to do here if you can get to them in the huge crowd and it's bring money to Cleveland. Overall just not that great."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

A nice addition to the Flats- and just a nice addition to places to go hang out. I'm quite happy with this addition to the Flats.

We went on opening night for a friend's birthday- and boy, it was packed. It's a cool place to hang out with friends- there's multiple levels with different activities to do- bowling, watching sports, a fireplace, food, and a ping pong table. Mind you, just a warning- we were playing ping pong with some new friends we had just met, the ball went flying, our friend went after that, and due to the water/drinks on the floor, he slipped and totally wiped out. So....just watch where you're stepping if you're playing ping pong! haha.

I haven't tried the food yet, so I can't really judge on the food, but it's a cool place to just hang out. It was hard to hear people (I guess that's a good sign?), but still a cool place to hang out- I think I would probably prefer this place on the weekdays as a chill place to hang out with friends or some coworkers."}
{"text":"Very poor logistics and absolutely no communication between staff members! We went here last night for my best friend's birthday, there were 9 of us. She had called at 9 am to make a reservation and the girl on the phone said \"we don't take reservations on the weekend.\" Weird, but okay. 
So we get there at 530 to see if we could get a table on the first floor, when we walked in the host asks if we had a reservation, my friend said \"no because you said this morning when I called that you don't take reservations on the weekend so we got here early\" the host said \"oh..........well the first floor is all reserved but you can go upstairs and it's open seating\" REALLY?? 
So we go upstairs and put some tables together for the group, a few people go downstairs and get drinks to bring back up. We waited 45 minutes before a server came upstairs to take our food order, we actually had to go downstairs and tell an employee that no one was up there to help us. 
Our server was very slow, probably because there is no POS computer take take orders or server station with supplies on the second floor and he had to go downstairs for every single thing we needed. Took 30 minutes to get a dang water for crying out loud! One random plate of food came to our table after about 30 minutes, turned out it was actually for the table next to us. It took 90 minutes to get our food!!!! AND when it came out it was COLD AND IN TO GO BOXES. We did NOT order to go. Our server blamed the kitchen and food runners for everything and did not take any responsibility upon himself for any of the issues. Who knows who fault it all was. It doesn't really matter but it's very unprofessional to play the blame game. 
We asked for a manager and he apologized for everything and insisted on taking the food off of our bill and brought out all new food in 5 minutes (hmm why did it take so long before then???) 
Definitely pissed off my friend whose birthday it was, we went to the Big Bang next door and had a much better time there. We will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Hailey was our server while my friend and I were visiting. She was at our table almost immediately after we sat down, checked on us frequently, and made sure to answer  any questions I had about the menu. Definitely one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome

So much to do! Bowling, ping pong, a little arcade, darts. I could stay here for hours. 

And I really could. The food is amazing ( try the new order chicken sandwich, it's the best). The cocktail menu is also great, I still need to try a few more to pick out the best."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I were looking for a place to watch The Wiz downtown. We had just got off work and we live all over the city so we were really hoping we could snag one of the TVs here. So we gave it and shot and they over delivered!

The first person recommended the best place to watch TV to avoid noise; when we asked if we could move the tables closer to the TV they said \"we'll help!\"; and when we asked for subtitles because this place is (naturally) too busy to be totally silent, they happily added them in. 

We revelled in our new musical haven with drinks in hand and smiles on our faces. But it didn't take too long for more people to join our area and they had their eyes on the game table between our chairs and the TV. I felt like we would be kicked aside in due time so that the new guests could enjoy the games...but instead the Punch Bowl employees moved the table out of our way so that both groups could be happy! 

I was ecstatic that they didn't feel the need to sacrifice a few customer's happiness for a larger group's. And I am so grateful they accommodated our odd request to borrow the television. It was a great night."}
{"text":"Hard to know where to start. At night it's a struggle to do anything. Wait on games is long, private parties block off sections of the establishments, impossible ordering drinks and expensive. 

During the day it's better, you can access the games (although 2 private parties going at once today took away bowling and access to the main bathroom). Food is descent and the portion size is good but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and drinks and was really impressed by everything.  The chicken and waffles were great, as was the rye old fashioned.  The decor was cool, the staff friendly, and I had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Came in for a private event for ROCKWELL and had a truly outstanding time our cocktail waitress hailey with the cat ears, she knew the whole drink menu and was able to help me select a great IPA for me and our coworkers. Definitely thinking about coming again when I'm in town from Michigan!!!"}
{"text":"Obviously I did not expect perfect service at Punch Bowl (bc it is what it is) but last night was ridiculous. Our reservation was for 7:30, we get there and the female worker with the black curly hair told us to \"roam around for fifteen minutes\". So we go to the bar. At 7:50 she told us fifteen more minutes and then said our reservation was not for 7:30 (but it was). I don't see the point in lying, if you forgot then whatever. We were less than pleased and went somewhere else. Just thought I'd share because this is something that should be worked on"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Manager Kevin is first class. Very attentive to detail, incredible hospitality. The place to Go. Best spot in Cleveland"}
{"text":"It is Labor Day and 1:30pm and you are out of about half of your menu... Big time disappointment. As I speak the lobby is filled with people who will soon be ordering off the half of the menu that is available. I placed my order only to find out ten minutes later that they were out of the item I picked. Staff is in the weeds and confused. Management failed the staff."}
{"text":"Prepare to empty your wallet before coming here. The food is delicious, so don't skip dinner. The cocktails are unique, so don't skimp on those.  And of course,  you can't miss the games, so prepare to spend a fortune. 

We came here on a Friday and the place was packed.  Make reservations if you'd like to sit and eat because we saw purple being turned away. The food is actually really mouthwatering. I had one of the best cuban sandwhiches of my life here, and my SO had a fabulous mac and cheese filled with porky bits. We were advised not to get the punch bowls because they hardly fill them, so we stuck to cocktails. If you do decide you need punch, grab a single serving. 

Bowling was the best option for us; a whopping $50 let four of us bowl on a tiny lane for an hour. The bowing is definitely the best activity. The arcade room is tiny and crowded.  Ping pong is right next to a bar/tables, so you're playing a game with high-speed flying balls admid a large crowd. I wasn't a fan of the games, but I suppose alcohol changes things. 

This place is fun to drink and do some group activities. Was it the awesome adult playground I thought it would be?  No way.  Did I have fun?  Actually, yes. This place would be pretty sweet for someone who enjoys crowds, but for someone like me who enjoys just watching Netflix most Friday nights, avoid this place on the weekend."}
{"text":"Uhhhhh, I once spent 6 hours on a Saturday afternoon here and I have no regrets. I ate food, drank out of a fancy glass bowl, sang karaoke (Shoop is my jam, if you're interested), and bowled my heart out, until it was time to have more drinks at the bar before suddenly realizing, \"damn, have I really been here for six hours?\" YEAH I HAD. 

PBS is so fun! I wouldn't stroll in on a Saturday evening expecting to do all the things I mentioned above without a long wait, but Saturday afternoon? You got it. The cost for each activity really isn't too high (I don't think, at least) and they have so much to do. Bowl, karaoke, billiards, darts, other games that I don't really care about... they have those too. The servers were all awesome, checked on us often, and were polite given the drunkenness of our group. I did dock a star because overall, I wasn't a huge fan of their food and we tried a lot. The wing marinade was a bit much and forgettable - too sweet. The pimiento cheese was tasty, but the amount of bread triangles didn't fit the ratio so we had to ask for more twice. The french fries were good, but how often do you meet a fried potato that doesn't taste delicious slathered in ketchup? Rarely. 

Anyways, Saturday or Sunday afternoons are where it's at. So much fun and can't wait to find an excuse to waste another 6 hours of my weekend here!"}
{"text":"This is review is based on their Sunday brunch.  Punch Bowl Social may have officially knocked Townhall off my top brunch destination in Cleveland.  The service was excellent and attentive, the place wasn't packed wall to wall and the parking on the street was free on Sundays. My most recent visit was for their Easter Brunch Buffet ($29pp) even though I have been here previously for just their regular brunch menu which is amazing as well.

My family started our meal with coffees($3) and the bloody mary bar ($10).  The bloody mary bar was wonderful with literally everything under the sun to add in. My favorite addition was their house bacon and Pope's spicy Bloody Mary mix. That's another thing to add in Punch Bowl's favor, they use locally sourced ingredients in a lot of their menu which is good to know a large national chain like this is helping the local farmers and small businesses.

Everything off of the regular menu was featured for the buffet in addition to an omelette station and prime rib carving.  My top picks would have to be the corned beef hash, monkey bread french toast, biscuits and gravy and their thick cut bacon.  The food was beyond tasty! The corned beef hash was filled with chunks not chipped corned beef.  The monkey bread french toast was cut thick and toped with caramel and walnuts and the biscuits were excellent topped with the spicy sage sausage gravy.  There wasn't one thing on the buffet to complain about, it was regularly restocked with fresh hot food and everything was labeled (which is great for those with food allergies).

I will defiantly say Punch Bowl Social does a mean brunch!  I will for sure be coming back regularly for their tasty food!"}
{"text":"Fair prices, plenty of space, contemporary decoration and styling. Great venue for groups or reunions. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but I've stopped in for drinks and games. 

In the summer there is corn hole on the roof or on the patio. 

All year round there are arcade games inside. I prefer the darts, bowling, foosball (there's even an extra large one upstairs), pool and shuffleboard. There is a nice mix of games and on the night I went the only really crowd was around the three dart boards. The activities are spread out in various areas and on two floors so the spacing is nice. This place really diversifies itself with a wide array of games making it a great spot for a night out; I had a great birthday night out here. 

Servers kept stopping by the bowling lanes to offer drinks and the girl working the game cage was helpful and friendly. The game cage is where you go to pay for bowling, get the darts, etc... Other games like at the smaller foosball table you just pay with coins at the machine.

The star reduction comes from a summer memory. If on the rooftop, just go to the bar and order your drink from the bartender. I made the mistake of accepting a roaming server's offer to get my drink. They aren't allowed to get them from the bar, so even though what I ordered was steps away, the server had to leave the rooftop to fill my order which took considerable time. I get the rule, but it isn't guest centered and was particularly annoying as I specifically ordered something I saw in the bar fridge so I would get it quickly."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  The food was outstanding, fresh and expertly prepared.  Our servers were outstanding... CC was our server for lunch yesterday and Jenna for brunch this morning.  We looked at other places for brunch, but went back to Punch Bowl because of the great experience yesterday.  A+++++"}
{"text":"Worst experience for a restaurant around Cleveland. No service for sitting here for 45 minutes. Not even a glass of water, after tables were being served around us. Finally asked a server from a different table for a menu and ordered ourselves from the bar. No apology from anyone. Don't eat here, I guess a drink is fine."}
{"text":"Not sure about these negative reviews. Maybe I haven't been there late enough?

I'm posting this after going three times with friends. We've had a blast playing the different games and drinking good beer. It's such an awesome space. Huge and accommodates a lot of people. I really dig the energy. 

I don't think the establishment should be rated poorly because some people get too drunk. From my experience, the bartenders were very friendly and the time last week when our food was slow, they apologized profusely for it, even though it really wasn't a big deal to us. My girlfriend, visiting Cleveland for only the second time, seemed to enjoy herself."}
{"text":"We had company in this weekend and decided to try it out for the first time. It was an absolute blast, the bowling and games were fun, but Hailey with the cat ears made it top notch. She continually checked on us making sure we always had a drink and anything we needed. Wonderful service, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and this Halloween has been the best time yet. We had a little issue in that the elevator was shut down, there weren't any tables that weren't hightops (an issue at many Cleveland spots) and a member of our party was in a wheelchair, but the staff bent over backwards to make us feel at home. They set us up upstairs and Hailey G. made sure we were never without food, drink, or conversation. If you're looking for a place to have a good time with a good drink, good food, and great staff, this is the place."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the flats.  There is so much to do here such as ping pong, pool, bowling, shuffleboard, and my favorite, pinball.  Oh, I almost forgot about the private karaoke rooms that groups can rent out.  

Be forewarned..... this is NOT a Dave and Busters kind of joint.  This is NOT a place where teenagers come with their fake ID's to get drunk.  This IS a place for people to come, unwind, and have a good time with friends.

The drinks are creative and sophisticated.  I enjoyed a bourbon cocktail that was garnished with sage and my dining companion had a tequila drink with muddled cucumber and lime juice.  They also have several craft beers on tap and in the bottle.  

I want to go back and try one of their entrees.  We've only sampled their appetizers so far.  The nachos were very good."}
{"text":"everytime i go here i really want to have a great time. and i almost do until i try to order something. The logistics to ordering drinks just doesnt make sense. especially it is a very stand and walk around kind of place. what they really need is a walkup bar that has no seats. because i usually go there and im playing darts, foosball,etc. and with out a server it gets really annoying trying to get a drink. 

I really love the idea of the spot, just the execution with service is far below par. 

This really grinds my gears....They dont sell any sparkling water (Perrier, San Pellogrino, Aqua Panna etc.) As a person that doesnt always drink when im out i would like to have options other that soft drinks out of the gun and tap water. Especially in a downtown district that has a higher price point. If my local dive bar...has bottled water. Im not trying to be a snob. Just saying its something i really expected for this place.

*Have yet to eat a meal here."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the service from Jessica, Joey, Danny, Jeremy, Adam, and Matt!!  They gave my friends the best service and made us feel at home. They treated us with great hospitality and courtesy. I highly recommend this location as a place to visit for anyone who comes through Cleveland or the flats!"}
{"text":"Came here with my work team, about 15 of us. Great atmosphere, lots of patrons (even though the location appears a but remote). Bowling lanes, arcade games, darts, shuffle board, ping pong, its loaded with things to do. Prices are reasonable. $5 a game for an hour of howling plus $3.50 shoes. Darts are free with license collateral. Shuffle is $2. Food was average. Chicken and Waffles looked impressively topped, but not my thing. Got a Cubano sandwhich with pork belly and ham. Not bad at $13. Beers were $5-7, ok...

Would go back for the entertainment, for sure. A better, more intimate Dave n Busters."}
{"text":"Beer selection vast. Cubano sandwich excellent. Service was on point. Downtown Wednesday night game strong."}
{"text":"Definitely a trendy, fun spot on the East Bank of the Flats. Pros: Bowling lanes, throwback arcade games, multiple bars, multiple floors, spacious, shuffle board, ping pong, and a private karaoke room. Cons: Can get pretty crowded on Friday and Saturday nights and just a smidge bit college. Went for brunch recently and the breakfast tacos, potatoes, and Bloody Mary I ordered were on point. Great service, too. Would definitely eat here again. Looking forward to trying dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"Place was awesome, great service, outstanding craft cocktails and quality food.  Best for the young professional, but solid for all comers."}
{"text":"Saturday night was crowded and way too loud in the dining area to hold a conversation. Drinks are subpar. The food was overpriced. $16 for a burger that consisted of two slim patties. Fries were good though! Our waitress was great and friendly! The really only positive here, besides waitress, are that the service employees  were in general, quick and attentive. Would I go back? Eh, no. Also, huge massive layout, but poorly executed positioning. The arcade games are jammed together and next to the kitchen that the staff continuously run through the games. There is only one ping pong table that rents for an hour at a time. Did they hire the architect that designed the Cleveland airport? Eh, probably. I kinda feel bad for the employees who work here."}
