{"text":"Not your typical shisha bar. Lovely older couple runs the place, always friendly and very affordable. After many different locations, my friends and I have found our place. Service is in English, Arabic and French. Great flavours, and a calm relaxing atmosphere (usually never too crowded or loud). Recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place! I've tried many shisha places in Montreal- Sharazad, Café Gitana, Café Hookah Lounge, Lux, etc, and this is by far my favourite. 
First, the service sets Cafe Toot apart. The woman who owns/ runs it is a sweet Egyptian woman, who is very friendly and helpful. Unlike other shisha places, you won't have to wait around forever waiting to be served.

Next, I was impressed with the atmosphere. I wanted to study, smoke some reasonably priced shisha, and sip on mint tea in a quiet environment- something none of the other shisha places provide, basically. At cafe toot, the front room is quiet enough to work (for me anyways), and there's other people studying or talking and hanging out. In addition, there is a second, much larger room in the back filled with comfy chairs. When I went on a weeknight, there was nobody at all in this room so you could essentially study/smoke in quiet if you wanted. I like that Cafe toot is good for both studying AND hanging out- where as other shisha places have super loud music and loud talking or only have one room, so they pretty much are only for hanging out. 

I also was impressed with how many coals I was given.. half a pack! At some places (like Café hookah lounge) you are only given one coal. With the number of coals Cafe Toot provides, you can smoke for a very long time. The price was also really good... I got mango shisha, and a pot of mint tea, and was charged $20 after taxes! The nice woman wouldn't even let me tip- unlike places like Sharazad up the street, where they have shitty service, and then hound you about giving a big tip anyways. 

Needless to say, I will be going back, and referring all my friends! 
Btw, to get to Cafe toot you just walk on St. Catherine street till Crescent street.. if you are coming from the direction of Guy-Concordia, you'll turn right, if you are coming from the other direction you turn left (there's a 3 Brasseurs restaurant on the corner of Crescent and St. Catherines you turn in that direction). It will be on the left side... the sign is unassuming so you gotta look for it."}
{"text":"Okay so I went there for the first time today and my first impression (from the outside) was ''Oh...it looks a bit dirty...it's probably going to be a crappy place''

I was soooooo wrong. The old couple who owns the café knows what good customer service is. The old man was just so nice, funny and polite. He even gave us a ''tour'' of his café. 

Nice place really ! 23 $ for a peach shisha (with 5 charcoal discs) and a kettle of tea for 2."}
{"text":"Despite an unassuming presence, this place is probably the best shisha lounge I have tried in Montreal. With almost 30 flavours of shisha, two different kinds of coals and a wide selection of Khalid Mahmoon hookahs, this place caters well to both the amateurs and connoisseurs. 

Location
It is located on a quieter part of crescent. It is nice because you are away from the hustle and bustle of St Catherine's but not too far that you can't just walk over. The place itself has a bit of a sketchy entrance but soldier on! It is worth it. 

Atmosphere
The atmosphere is relaxed and the best part is, they have a wide spectrum of clientele. Everyone from university students to tourists. 

Customer Service
This is where this place just takes the crown. The couple that run this place are both knowledgeable and hospitable. While we were puffing away, he noticed that some people in our group were a bit inexperienced with changing the coals so he came by (very unobtrusively) and helped them out. Then through the night he just kept an eye and actually changed the coal whenever he saw the need to. Never seen that at other shisha places. Oh, and as soon as we had an urge to play some cards, he had a deck ready. Again customer service at its best. 
 
The Main Event
The shisha itself is fresh and moist which makes for flavorful thick smoke. The coals are fresh and last awhile. Oh and get that Moroccan mint tea. It is a nice chaser to the hookah. 

Overall amazing experience at less than $20 per hookah.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"Ahhh Café Toot, I spent so much time there during my CEGEP days, and since I moved back to Montreal a few months ago, I went back many times. 

The tobacco used is still top notch stuff, Al Fakher tobacco, served by a very nice elderly Egyptian couple. You have a choice of coals, between the coconut coals and the normal ones and the tea is awesome, albeit way sweeter than what I'm used to, since I'm East Asian.

The third time I went there in 2 weeks with the same coworker, we received free muffins from the owner. It was really cool! Really nice place to hang out and read or study."}
{"text":"-relaxed atmosphere
-excellent service
-good prices for quality of shisha
great location and hours"}
{"text":"Asked for a menu and he said there is no menu and started naming all the shisha flavors. Usually the hookah places I go to come out with the hookahs already pulled. But my hookah wasn't and had to pull myself which was kind of annoying. I wanted to use my credit card but it was cash only."}
{"text":"Needs more love on Yelp. Very nice cute old Egyptian couple serving good hookah in a relaxing environment.

Tables and couches mostly utilized by students studying and conversing in English, French and Arabic. The husband and wife duo can speak all 3 languages and are very attentive. Quick-light coals are the default but you can pay to upgrade to square coil-heated coals.

If you're looking for a relaxing place to sit for a spot of tea and some shisha before going out further, drop  by here. 

Note: no booze but you can bring your own food or buy the snacks they have on hand."}
