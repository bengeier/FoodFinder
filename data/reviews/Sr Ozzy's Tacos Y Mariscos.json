{"text":"I have 2 reviews first one had nothing but great things to say about ozzys. This review I gota change my ratings I dnt know if they changed cooks or what but it just ain't the same. service was crap the last 2 times I went and the food was not what it once was flavor was not there seems like there losing there touch hope they turn it around and get back on the ball. I will go back a couple of more times and hope it gets back what they had I really liked this place so I gota give the benefit of the doubt that they were just having a bad week if it don't change then I will begin a search for a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ from LA a little over a year ago, I really struggled finding a really good Mexican spot and Mariscos, especially in the East Valley. I have yet to find a place in which the food reminds of home, so when I finally went to Senor Ozzy's, I was in heaven. It takes me 40-45 minutes to get there, but believe me it is really worth the drive. First the prices are really good and they run specials all the time for example 10 tacos for $10. You can't compete with that at all. They have marlin tacos that are so tasty and the mulitas are awesome. They have a pretty full menu, so any type of craving you may have, they will fill it. The servers are very humble and accommodating and usually walk out in a food coma.   Also, don't forget to get a cup of their SenorChelada beer mix. That is also the best tasting michelada mix I have ever had. You can taste the fresh ingredients that they use in the mix."}
{"text":"Great authentic mariscos and Mexican food. Such a large variety of tasty dishes, I drive across town and bypass a bunch of other places just to go eat there. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Senor Ozzy's tonight and loved it ! The service was great and the food was fantastic. My new go-to place@"}
{"text":"I am very sorry to say Arizona residents but your taste buds have grown accustomed to less than average tasting food. The Al Pastor was ok in taste but extremely dry, The Asada was dry and lacks a quality meat, The aguachiles and ceviche lack flavor entirely."}
{"text":"Just had the breaded shrimp burrito for the 2nd time and it is still on point. This place opens from 7am to 10pm and has plenty on the menu from ceviche to seafood to tacos and Sonoran hot dogs. Hot dogs are all beef which is a plus. Taco Tuesday's and Menudo on Saturdays and Sunday's. Young guys making it happen,new spot and If you're out on the Westside I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything I try is delicious! Some of my favs are the beer battered shrimp taco, the shrimp and queso taco, Sonoran dogs and carne asada fries. They have daily specials that are also delicious. We are here at least once every two weeks now."}
{"text":"Finally a good spot. I was tired of the same old spots around here. Been here about 5 times now and I love this place. Ceviche de camarón is on point."}
{"text":"This place is not a 4 star restaurant. I went and got a burrito for lunch and it was greasy I got home the bag was wet and tortilla was soggy. No Bueno"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!! Good luck Vaqueros!! This is my go to spot!! Fresh good and fast service!"}
{"text":"Very Good!  Was visiting the area for work and stumbled upon this place.   Owner \"Ozzy\" greeted us as we walked in, made us feel welcome.  Simple and clean with the kitchen in full view.  We had a variety of tacos and a large mx shrimp cocktail, all were excellent.  I loved the carnitas, my coworker almost took my hand off going for the last pollo taco, and the shrimp cocktail was packed with... you guessed it, SHRIMP!  Ozzy made sure everything was good before bringing us the very modest bill.  Ozzy also mentioned this is a new permanent location, as they started with a successful food truck and catering business previously, which also has great reviews. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great prompt and courteous service. The food is wonderful. They have weekend specials and menudo"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Hands down the best  food I have had in Arizona since I've moved from Cali. My family and I will most definitely being coming back. Also, great service and there was not a long wait."}
{"text":"Recommended by yelp, I stopped her today, my job put me in this area. Service was friendly. I asked what was in the carne asada burrito. Gal said meat, beans and rice. I requested no rice, add guacamole and cheese. Quickly bagged up with both red and green salsa sides.  Burrito was huge! My only comment is there was no visible cheese, big bunches of cilantro  and onions.  I don't mind either but bunches of cilantro can be overwhelming. Steak, avocado and tortilla tasted good."}
{"text":"This will be my go to spot, when I'm Solo or just want some tasty mariscos. Just around the corner from my place too."}
{"text":"Visiting from Minnesota and stopped in and had steak tacos and shrimp cocktail they were both fresh, flavorful and delicious! I plan on stopping by one more time to try something else before I leave. Oh! Try the carneasada fries they are loaded with all sorts of cheese sour cream and stuff. My friend loved them. We also got 10 chicken tacos to go for the husband and he was very satisfied as well."}
{"text":"First time here and it's gotta be one of my top places for tacos and mariscos. According to the nice waitress, they've got 10 for $10 tacos on Taco Tuesdays and on weekends. Can't beat that. Let's hope they continue with the great impression they've made on me."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food and very close to my work, easy to pick up my lunch when I am not bringing my lunch for work. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday mid afternoon for an early dinner. The food was excellent with a variety of traditional offerings that far exceeded any Mexican food north or south of the Arizona border. From carne to mariscos to pollo, the portions are ample, tasty, and very satisfying. The service was on point also. It's a small but fun atmosphere that does add to the total enjoyment of the meal."}
{"text":"Their shrimp tacos are good. Everything was good actually. Very nice people that run this truck. I ordered something wrong and didn't like it and they offered to give me something similar instead after I took a bite of what I ordered. They even helped shoo a bee away from my table. Tasty food made by very hospitable people."}
{"text":"I've eaten carne asada fries at almost every location in Phoenix. They have the best carne asada fries in Phoenix, as well as many other excellent options to choose from. Oh my goodness, if you've never been here, put it on your bucket list.  This is a must, you can't go just once. It will become your favorite place like mine.  Don't hesitate just go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Its good to have great food, but just not great food but great delicious mexican food in the heart of South Phoenix. I have tried everything from their tacos to their seafood dishes and have not been disappointed. Now the price is a little on the high end but totally worth every dollar. This is my new fav spot. Thank Sr Ozzy for picking this spot to open your restaurant with delicious food."}
{"text":"Omg my chicken burrito was so amazing! I don't know what they do to the chicken but it's perfectly seasoned and delicious! It's hard finding good Mexican food places out here coming from LA! And not to mention the customer service is great, the place is clean, good prices and my burrito was huge for the price! Yes this is my spot now!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was GOOD! 2 stars for the customer service. Also menu states once price, charged different for cabeza tacos. They had 2 waitresses restaurant style, that were bad. Young girls that maybe haven't been told how to act in front of customers. They were dancing, calling each other names. Had to ask for our drinks and salsa for our tacos after our food had already been brought out. I was one of two tables there, I could just imagine if they were busy. One of them was eating while \"on the job\"...scoot her plate over to take a customers order. Even though this is a roach coach, I would expect a lil more if they want to be \"restaurant\" style with waitresses, sit and we will take your order. It would be easier and faster to order at the window and go get my order when it's ready."}
{"text":"We used to really like maricos playa hermosa ceviche and cocktails.... haven't been back there since we found sir ozzy... :)   Torta mix is the way to go!!! It s flavorful, full of fresh seafood and make my mouth watering up every single time I think of it. The raw shrimps ceviche is uh-ma-zing especially with such a good price!   There were time when My fiancé and me came back 3 times in a week just for that torta mixta... that's how amazing it is! Easily one of the best in town and the quantity is amazing as we both full after sharing one :)  I wish We could try more dishes but every time we are there we just can't stop getting the torta mixta.. and guess what? We haven't regret now and probably won't ever lol   Other dishes such as taco, burrito, carne asada fries are just okay... some is a bit difficult to eat. we have had better elsewhere   Still solid 5 stars just because we are in love s the torta mixta haha"}
{"text":"Their food and customer service are great.  I go here every chance I have.  The place is always clean and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"A bit of a drive from Tempe but always worth it. Love the ambiance of the place and the food as well. Great service and tacos!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada burro in the valley!Awesome beer battered fish tacos too. Chipotle sauce and Avocado sauce are out of this world.  Sonoran Hotdogs wrapped in bacon have excellent flavor with a great bun.  A definite must try!"}
{"text":"One of the best seafood places by far , they definitely focus more on food then anything else. Food is perfectly balanced and seasoned . Family environment , hole in the wall restaurant for sure . Proportion for the price is insane , you will leave with a full belly . Five stars , definitely underrated , will be definitely be coming coming again."}
{"text":"Just landed from my plight and I wanted a good meal. Found this place and wasn't too impressed. I ordered the mar y Tierra quesadilla (steak & shrimp) and it literally has 3 tiny pieces of shrimp! The steak had lots of fat. My bf got fish and shrimp tacos and those were good. The waiter yelled across the restaurant to ask us what form of payment. That was so unprofessional."}
{"text":"What a great find. Venturing out for a taco Tuesday special and this was very special. Excellent food, great portions and incredibly friendly service. It's a drive but a drive worth taking. No ambience so this isn't a place for a romantic date.   We had a great server but the bonus was Denise. She was an excellent server and from the speed of her approach, she was an equally excellent worker. She was knowledgeable and her people skills were off the chart. I'll return for many food reasons but her kindness is the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Everyone was nice the chicken quesadilla I had was real good, but my friends had food options with seafood/shrimp in it and they said they didn't like it. I think they were being silly because the shrimp looked raw. I feel it is a good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Hours says they close at 10:00 got here at 9:20 they were already locking the doors. Looks like the employees were excited to go home early. All the chairs were up on the tables already. Food looks good too bad I didn't get to try it and I drove half and hour out of my way to."}
{"text":"The best thing here is the grilled shrimp taco. It may be the single best food item in all of South Phoenix. But the carne asada burrito, the grilled shrimp burrito, and the breakfast burritos are all very good as well. Plus there's a whole section of the menu I have yet to try, with aguachiles, shrimp cocktail, and other seafood items.   If there is one complaint, it's that the drive-thru will take about five to ten minutes. Modern American culture has us trained to want everything now. Just be patient or call ahead.  This is a great new restaurant. If you like Mexican and are anywhere close to 17th Ave and Southern, give it a try.  Note: the fried shrimp burrito, while very good, has a lot of mayonnaise. Fair warning!"}
{"text":"The key here is the oil brushed and grilled taco shells once your meat and cheese are inside.  You must treat yourself to the carne and camaron empanizado tacos.  Best in Arizona.  Service is fantastic and they have big tall 32 oz bottles beers.  Perfect accomplishment"}
{"text":"This was my first and probably last time here. I stopped here on my way home from work and ordered almost 50.00 of food. First off it was so hot I almost felt that the heater was on. I get that it's outside but they did have coolers. The waitress was nice took our order and gave us our food. While driving off we realized we didn't get out drinks we had paid for. Then we get home ready to eat and the 10 tacos we ordered were missing so there we go driving all the way back there again. The food was ok nothing I would brag about or go out if my way to go there."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Sr. Ozzy's! My wife really enjoys the food here especially being from Mexico she says the tacos remind her of the tacos in Mexico. The food is authentic Mexican food and it's always made fresh. It's nice to stop inside for a bite to eat. My favorite thing is the Mar y Tierra tacos! Definitely recommend giving those a try!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went here recently for dinner. I got 2 tacos de asada & a tostada de camaron, my husband got the carne Asada burrito, which had beans in it, so pretty good! The red salsa they had was a little spicy but tasty..I'll definitely be coming back, especially for the tostadas..I fell in love with them!"}
{"text":"The staff is courteous and the food is awesome! Fast service even got me home in time for the rest of the cardinals game"}
{"text":"Menu is simple and food is delicious! Got carne asada and al pastor  tacos 10/$10 on taco Tuesday.. they were sooo yummy and very filling!! Highly recommend! Ceviche tostada was also well worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! So good! Had the Asada Tacos and the Cevichelada! Will definitely be back! It's got a great home atmosphere almost like your family in their home!"}
{"text":"Authentic and amazing. My mouth celebrated as the flavors hit my tongue. It would be a disservice for me to try and explain to you about my experience."}
{"text":"This place is delicious you get your money's worth. They have a variety of Mexican favorites, from Sonoran Hot dogs, tacos de asada, pastor, shrimp,adobada and the list goes on. They even have Mariscos which we will definitely be trying next time. This place is a little diamond in the wrath. I recommend to anyone who is looking for some good Mexican food. Try it for yourself and let me know of you feel the same."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered to go and their tacos are delicious! 10/$10 every day. I wasn't a big fan of the shrimp taco but the cabeza, asada and pastor were delish! The vampiro was good but I'm not sure I'll get it again... maybe. Carne asada fries, best I've had! We know where to go close to home!"}
{"text":"I am here to say that this will be my new go to place to mariscos. I really enjoyed coming to a place where the menu is full of good items and decent prices. I am in love with the grilled shrimp taco. It has generous amount of shrimp and flavor. I also tried ceviche tostada. I was very pleased that it was a perfect amount of shrimp and vegetables. Perfect mound of tasty fresh seafood on top of shell that did not get soggy. Ripe fresh green avacado topping it off. Mmmm mmmm. Just by trying these few things and liking them makes me very positive on trying other items on the menu. Quality, freshness,goodness and reasonable prices are always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Came here to try a few new menu items and from what i can tell you this will still be a 5 star place to me. Seen on their Instagram page they where adding new items and we just had to come try them. We ordered a sr.ozzy sushi roll, los Chile's del Gordo and chili mar y Tierra. First off out of the three we absolutely loved the first one and the third one, we would continue to come back just for those. The sr. Ozzy roll we felt it was missing something just not sure what. Well Ricardo helped us figure that out and now we are happy with the results. Just as good maybe even better then some of the other sushi places out right now."}
{"text":"SKRIMP! They do it right here. The Shrimp and Carne Asada taco is AbFab! That's the Mar y Tierra for you gueros out there. The shrimp and fried cheese taco was also incredibly tasty. Speaking of cheese, everything they make here is with the most delicious Mexican Cotija style cheese, you will absolutely love it. The service was great, and the place was very clean. What bumped it from 4 to 5 stars for me, was when I ordered a Pacifico and was asked if I wanted a regular or a \"Ballena\" (no, at the time I didn't know that Ballena meant big ass bottle) but I did now I hardly ever want the \"regular\" anything. I got a 32 ounce bottle of Pacifico service from the icy cold for a mere eight dollars American! I didn't know what to do, I got all choked up. I felt like that part of Lord of the Rings where Merry and Pippin discover \" it comes in pints\"... only it's not pints, it's quarts! What can I say? God bless Tolkien, the food and the indomitable spirit of the Mexican people... and God bless us everyone!"}
{"text":"So tonight we tried the carne asada tacos and pastor tacos, carne asada quesadilla and all were very good! Pastor is very flavorful... I'm glad we live close. Its inexpensive too... What to try next time..."}
{"text":"We came in for a family dinner and they did not disappoint! My sons ordered carne asada fries and a rice/bean burrito, I had a molcajete and hubby had the asada Torta. We all LOVED everything, the service is great and we all ate for $55 with drinks. Great Sunday dinner we will be back!"}
{"text":"Best tacos on this side of town! I had shrimp and chicken tacos, the shrimp taco was so flavorful. The service was also great!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Dining area is small and with small tables and tight seating it wouldn't  be comfortable for more than 2 people at once.  Although there are four chairs to a table there's no way four adults would fit comfortably. This is the reason for 4 stars & not 5. We did not use their bathrooms therefore cannot comment on their cleanliness.  Service: was very good and very attentive. Food: tasted great! The pastor tacos came out sizzling hot, the ceviche tostadas were a lot bigger than anticipated and the shrimp cocktail was quite large as well."}
{"text":"BEST CEVICHE IN AZ? We go to Mexico all the time & love the ceviche, but this place topped it. The shrimp & cheese tacos are the bomb too! We live in Gilbert but will drive the distance... it's worth it. Great-fast service & prices. Well done guys!!"}
{"text":"Finger lickin good on the Mar y Tierra Quesadillas that shrimp and azada was cooked to perfection, the sauce they use is Heaven! I cuould of split the Quesadilla with my Mom but each of us got one  of our own and we couldn't even finish it.  Just moved to Arizona and I have been looking for a spot like this, I am most definitely coming back and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  I believe I am going to be a regular here! Kudos to the Chef I visited yesterday Wednesday about 2 pm it was not super busy and I enjoyed every single bite."}
{"text":"We had Ozzy cater my baby shower today and all I can say is W-O-W. My soon to be mother-in-law had him cater for her a handful of times before and raved about him so we decided to give him a try. . boy am I glad we did! To start off, scheduling this event via email was beyond easy. It did take a few tries to reach him--I had been trying via phone and since opening his restaurant, is always insanely busy--but luckily, my soon to be m.i.l. remembered having better luck reaching him via email. Once we got in touch though, everything went smoothly! Ozzy responded promptly and planning was very simple from start to finish. I didn't have an exact headcount so he had me email him a week before and drew up an invoice then. His team was scheduled to arrive an hour early for setup and he arrived right on time if not a tad early all ready to go! They setup everything and as soon as they were ready to serve he came in and let me know. We ordered the street tacos (pork, steak & chicken) as well as rice, beans & chips w/ guac. The tacos were absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! So were the rice/beans/guac, but the tacos naturally stole the show. I don't know how else to describe them but they were phenomenal and tasted very authentic. All of our guests agreed and couldn't stop raving about the food. I'm actually heating up the leftovers (yes, they give you ALL your leftovers) right now. They also provide all the sides and condiments like pico, onions, cilantro etc. and even plates & utensils. Oh and the pricing? More than reasonable! If you're looking for the most authentic street tacos for a great price and outstanding service then look no further and book Ozzy for your next event. You will not be disappointed! Now. . .back to my leftovers!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is always great and the food on point. Recommend the Cevichelada."}
{"text":"Probably the best shrimp burrito that I've had in Phoenix in 30 plus years. Well seasoned excellent rice, perfectly cooked shrimp and outstanding salsa. Great portion for the price. Very clean restaurant with super friendly staff. I work in the area and will absolutely return for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here because they have a pretty good yelp rating but was disappointed in the end. The kid taking our order let his phone ringer interupt my order placement then didn't even have the memory span to recall what i had ordered because of it. Waited a good 15-20 min. at the window without even so much as a courtesy check up, when food was finally recieved it was cold. Now I'm not a picky guy when it comes to food, i will eat just about anything you put in front of me, but don't serve me cold food after a long ass wait in a drive thru. Food was alright, customer service was wack."}
{"text":"Love this local place! Great deal on taco Tuesdays! 10 tacos for $10.00, and it consistently tastes great! The only (insignificant) downside is ambiance around it. But the place itself is clean and neat."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Absolutely delicious! We ordered the Sonoran dog, cheese quesadillas and molcajete de Cameron. Service was quick and polite. Definitely recommend them"}
{"text":"I enjoy all the delicious  food this place offers. Great quality plates.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Tried this place today! It's so good! My tostada was yummy! The ceviche was out of this world. My daughter loves her quesadilla! This is probably the best horchata I've had in Phoenix. Will definitely be dragging my  husband here so I can eat it again!"}
{"text":"Definitely great food doubt. I was skeptical, place wasn't open long and great reviews.  I asked why when I went in & was told a lot of loyal customers from old location.  Well its always buzzing and well worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican food in town!  The mariscos, burros, tacos, etc! I haven't had a dish that wasn't amazing... The seasonings, the love they put in, and it's an experience."}
