{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  If you are looking for great tacos, do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"The bombest tacos in Charlotte for $2 EVERY DAY. All the white people here complain that there aren't enough taco places in town because they aren't in familiar areas like down East Blvd or on E Bland....Hello, there are plenty of Mexican restaurants...You just have to go to Mexican neighborhoods.   Seeing boring white people get excited about $2 taco Tuesday at a white owned tex-mex chain is disappointing when there is an independent restaurant a little further away, making their own tortillas, and charging $2 consistently- for a far superior tasting product.   Come here, get several of the tacos al pastor and some queso and chips.  We make it out of here spending $27 pre-tip getting 8 tacos, queso and chips, a Mexican coke, and an extra side of cebollitas and chiles....like a pair of pot-bellies bandits.  Service is usually a miss but who gives a shit? There is sometimes a language barrier and I've never been to Mexico so I don't know if they're friendly at their taquerias to customers, anyway.   Seat yourself and make sure to go up to the register and pay after you're done. Ask for an itemized check, because they won't give you one."}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I've ever had.. def the best in Charlotte. Worth the trek across town to grab some to go. I recommend just grabbing a variety. We had the barbacoa, pastor and one other and they were all super delicious. If you want authentic tacos without pretension- check  this place out."}
{"text":"good food, qiuck service,only thing negative is sodas come in a bottle so refills are not free!!!  otherwise very good food!!  authentic mexican cooks are always a plus!!!  i would recommend it!  the chicken flautas are amazing!!"}
{"text":"They catered a community event this week and it was make your own tacos. I have got to go back! The chicken tacos were very simple just tortillas, chicken, three choices of salsa, cilantro, and lime. First of all they were amazingly simple but flavorful. Second of all the marinade the chicken was in was spicy but did not burn my tongue at all. My lips however, were close to on fire. That was the general consensus. It was unusually hot for mexican food, but totally delicious and I will be going to their restaurant."}
{"text":"Almost always a pleasure to dine here. It is hole in the wall. There are two locations but I find this one to have a juicier al pastor. Queso is average but still it's white queso so I'm gonna dunk all da tings in it. The tacos al pastor is king here and the tortillas are made in house and so so good. And the cebollitas and hot peppers are great accoutrements. Don't expect this to be a hot date night place unless you are over the frills. Not much ambiance or cocktails."}
{"text":"Simply Awesome.  Authentic and tasty.  Great little hole in the wall, furniture was cool, they diddn't speak english really; but we were able to get exactly what we ordered.  We had Carne Asada; very good.  The chips and salsa: freshly cooked chips; sauces were fresh; tomatillo sauce was great.  Gave us a piece of Cactus to eat with the Carne; complimented it well.  Bean soup was great.  Everything seemed very fresh and tasted amazing; good prices!"}
{"text":"They have mexican soda so that's a plus. The good is cheap and the portions are huge. The only real problem I had was being ignored for almost 45 minutes. We were almost done eating by the time we were asked of the food was good. We wanted to order another drink but the sever never came back until 15 minutes after we were done eating. It seemed like she was avoiding us, cleaning the tables around us and not bothering to check on is despite our attempts to look pathetic and needy."}
{"text":"This place is not that good after all, everytime i go for a take out or dine in. They never get my order right and most of the time my food is cold. I'm not gonna eat the food that they put in front me, just because i am hungry. I want what I pay for it's my money. I hope that anybody that sees my review pay a little atention on the details, and not take it just because You are so hungry...."}
{"text":"Yoooooo. Legit tacos. Effing delicious and worth the chance of becoming a victim of a crime in the area. But don't worry, the area seems to be on the rise as hipsters from Plaza Midwood extend their reach. Maybe? Maybe not?  But the tacos though and the sauces they have, *drools*."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mexican food , but all i tried is Americanised- Mexican food , couple of my Mexican friends took me to this place and I liked the food .. This is closest real Mexican food I ever had and I appreciate this restaurant .. I had a fountain drink - Jamaica and Sopes - it was good I enjoyed my lunch !!"}
{"text":"This was very close to traditional Mexican from Mexico. I had Tripe, tongue, chicarones, and pastor tacos. The toppings were fresh, as was the three salsas that came with my to-go order. Staff was very nice . The decor is what you would expect. I would trade decor over quality of food any day. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!!  Beef tongue was incredible as was barbacoa!!  I had been told there was great Mexican food in charlotte but this place certainly proved it!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place NEGATIVE stars. First off, I love tacos and USED to love this place but just today, I went back after some time of not going and was expecting A1 tacos like usual but this time I ordered 3 tacos, 1 steak, 1 Chorizo (Mexican sausage), and 1 Pastor (Pork) .. well they brought out the tacos and ended up giving me Steak and 2 tacos that did not look like Chorizo or Pastor. One looked like tofu and one was some kind of soggy greasy meat. I had them take it back, because that's NOT what I ordered and they took it back and made \"new\" ones.. when I received my \"new\" tacos they weren't new at all. IT WAS THE SAME PLATE. So, I told them I didn't want these tacos because they weren't good and I was a regular customer and they NEVER looked this way. After 20 minutes of arguing with the waitress that I wouldn't pay for these nasty tacos that I -DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH- she called the Owner over the phone.. which I was happy thinking the owner would accommodate me, well the owner was WORSE than the waitress and said that the meat is fine and no one has complained and that I had to pay for these tacos. I told her fine, I would pay but IM NEVER GOING BACK. She said she would cut the Taco price in half but why would I pay for tacos I didn't even eat? They're full of B.S. and a huge disappointment. STAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PLACE!! What was once my favorite Taco spot is now a crap hole with rude employees. Moral of the story is they DO NOT CARE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AT ALL. They were more interested in making me pay $6 then my loyalty as a customer. HATE THIS PLACE. NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte area from New England and was looking for some good Mexican food. The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because I don't think they have a full bar, and I do like getting a Paloma and/or a margarita when I go to Mexican restaurants. The food was amazing and authentic. The staff very friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love tacos and this place was authentico me no speaky muy espanol  All the staff is Spanish speaking and the locals had every seat occupied. Good sign, cheerful waitress and I would recommend this to any taco seeking aficionado"}
{"text":"Quick recap: legit Mexican for a legit price. Small place with great service.Pretty much a hole in the wall place that is worth checking out.   This place is a bit out there with no major highway or retail spot which would bring traffic in. Unless you live close by you probably won't know it exist.   With that being said I would recommend people make the drive to this place to check it out. Pretty authentic for a good price.   Only thing I will say is that the chorizo here is not as spicy and full flavored as most chorizo you find in restaurants but it's still good."}
{"text":"First time I've ever seen a restaurant actually ask you for tips had one girl tell me are you going to leave a tip which seems kind of rude or even unprofessional I mean you only see the waitress twice once when she takes the order and another one when  she brings you the food and I know what you're thinking this guy is cheap, I know they live off their tips. Imagine you're in line waiting to pay the the check and it doesn't matter if you dine  in or you ordered to go there make sure they put you on the spot by asking you in front of everybody are you gonna leave a tip."}
{"text":"As someone who is constantly on the hunt for good, authentic tacos, this place has certainly made the cut. Some of the best tacos Ive had [in Charlotte]. I also tried their horchata and it was quite \"chalky\". Not in an authentic, residual rice way but in a last glass at bottom of a carton way."}
{"text":"Tacos were good, salsa was OK. I ordered few Barbacoa tacos, they had good flavor but very greasy for my taste. My friend had a steak torta, he said that was actually very similar to the ones he had in Mexico. I would like to try this place again and hopefully their meat won't be as greasy. The price is fair though for their portions"}
{"text":"Rico! Besides the wait (which k get because the food is great) there's nothing wrong with this place, there's always a line coming out the door and the tables always full because the tacos, tortas and quesadillas are that good! Authentic tasty food."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos in Charlotte, as a Mexican, I tried many places in the city just because I miss authentic food and this one is always the best option for tacos!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had.  This place is 4.5 stars for a reason...and that is because some people who shouldn't be writing reviews gave them a bad rating bc they didn't like their waitress.  Give this place a shot...i love their (something) hambre. Homemade corn tortillas. Great house made salsas and a real authentic vibe."}
{"text":"This place is one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants we've been to in Charlotte! Everything from the tacos, sopes, gorditas, sauces and drinks were tasty! I'm taking away one star because they don't offer chips! First restaurant I've been to that doesn't have chips!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite tacos spot. I eat tacos on a regular basis (food trucks being my favorite ) and this place blows all of them out of the water. I could eat here every day if I was closer. I make special trips to come here. Honestly if you don't think these tacos are good than you are probably brain washed by all the American places and don't know what a good taco is. This is authentic tacos how they are served in the heart of Mexico."}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious! I got the pollo and asada. Very authentic and affordable. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Not sure why people say this is a whole in the wall. Its a fairly noce, and very traditionally decorated mexican restaurant. Good food. The gordita shells are a bit thin. Their chicken is amazing. I would rate a 4.5,  i have eatin at many mexican restaurants tho and am very picky.   Also their burrito is good as well. There are green beans and peas in it which i havent seen before and is a little odd."}
{"text":"Can't say this was my preferred Mexican food.   You walk in and you seat yourself. They only serve beer for alcohol. You're provided with three salsas but not chips.  We preferred cokes and cheese dip. The cokes were in bottles and Mexican cokes and so yummy. The cheese dip was watered down but good. They only provide a small amount of chips. We ran out before half way done with the dip.  I ordered a beef burrito and rice and beans. Sadly, I did not like any of the above. The beans were runny, the rice had some dehydrated and dehydrated peas. The beef burrito had very crispy beef bits that I didn't love.  My boyfriend ordered the beef fajita burrito and really liked it.  The food proportions were large and service was nice. It was not busy on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Im so glad we decided to try this place.  Looks like a hole in the wall but dang!!! Yummy! Pollo and pastor tacos are soooo good!  Price can't be beat.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best food I have had in quite a long time. I love this place!! Had the canitas and a gordito with chicken. Washed it all down with a bottle of very cold Mexican coke."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at a good price. Ordered a variety of authentic tacos and Mexican Coke. Service was great. I'll stop by next time I'm in the mood for tacos."}
{"text":"Still the best tacos in town.   This location is mostly take-out, with just a few seats inside. It's always busy, and always good.  There's homemade salsa verde, rojo, and something avocado-y on the table and included with to-go orders--- and that stuff is awesome!  I've bought it by itself to take home. Give this little strip mall joint a try."}
{"text":"I love this location although anyone hardly speaks english! VERY AUTHENTIC TACOS ! \" MEXICAN FOOD \""}
{"text":"Real authentic tacos! You would probably drive right past this place if you weren't looking for it but they have won BOB awards for tacos! I think I have tried every taco they have on the menu but the Barbacoa is the best in my opinion. The employees speak Spanish and a little English so be prepared to have a language barrier most days but the menu is in English and Spanish so they usually understand what you are trying to order. There is not many seats inside but you usually can find at least 1 table to sit at if its not the lunch or dinner rush. For $3 you really cant beat it."}
{"text":"AL PASTOR TACO IS WHERE IT'S AT!!!!!! Tastiest $2 ever!! I''m not even a taco person but OMG why did I ever go anywhere else for a Mexican fix? Bc don't!!! Absolutely no need. Has to be authentic, bursting with major flavor & very tender meat. I've come here  plenty of times in a short period bc 1st visit gets you addicted.  Everyone is amazingly sweet & new updated menus are also in English so language barrier no more! Even though my orders have always been taken swift and easy anyways. All orders are paired with their tasty sauces which are hottest, avocado, & medium.  1st time visit was dine in & they have about 4 tables. Our son eventually wanted out of his car seat & we took turns bouncing him on our lap then one lady worker noticed & offered a high chair-we didn't even expect them to have one but cute plus for having the cleanest one we've ever come across in a restaraunt & thank you to her for being so thoughtful!   From a Charlottean, just keep them in business & eat here!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very local taco joint, almost everyone in there is spanish. We decided to try it out because my bf is craving some real mexican food, and it has good review on yelp. We order 4 tacos (tripa, lengua, chorizo, and carnitas) and comb tortas.  Also 2 hachatas while we are waiting.  The staff is not the friendliest or most efficient, and you better know spanish if you want some food from here. After waited at least 20 minutes for our order we finally got it.   Ok, the tacos looks really, but they taste very dry all of them. There's barely any taste to them, and the tripa tasted burn. My bf's tortas is pretty decent. I don't know if it's a one time mistake or what, but I am not impressed by the tacos at all."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from us and we did not want to cook!  It's a little hole in the wall and the space is not that big, but it was welcoming and comfortable. The language barrier is a little difficult but not too hard. I ordered 3 tacos (chicken, al pastor, and barbacoa), she asked if I wanted onions and cilantro and I said yes. We ordered it to go, and she said it would take about 15 minutes.   When we got it home (she included a green sauce) we laid it all out. I squeezed the lime on top and added a little sauce. The flavors of these tacos are AMAZINGGG!! The green sauce had a little kick to it that I was not expecting, but still so good!!  This is my new taco spot! I cannot wait to try the other tacos!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Carne asada - very good. Al pastor good. They bring you 3 salsas to the table and no chips - you have to order those separately. Overall good place for tacos. Didn't try other things but they looked kind of average."}
{"text":"If you are looking for legit Mexican tacos, Tacos El Nevado is your spot. $2 will get you some fresh, tasty tacos. They don't have chips at this spot and seating is limited. Don't skip the chorizo & make sure to try all the salsas!"}
{"text":"I am brand new to the Charlotte area and decided to try this place out! The food was fresh and delicious. I had 3 different tacos-steak, pork, and chicken. All wonderful! It's extremely authentic and the staff is friendly! I was very pleased and will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"I had heard a bunch of good things about this place. I have traveled all over Mexico and was hoping this would get close to what they make. Customer Service was terrible, the cashier was tapping her foot while we looked at the menu, then I tried to order a Tlayuda and they were out. We ordered one of each kind of taco to be able to try everything. The campechanos and carnitas were really good. Barbacoa was bland and cold as well as the grilled jalapenos. Pastor was decent. Everything else okay. Sodas were warm. I really enjoyed the meal but they lacked on the service."}
{"text":"Nice little place, tacos got great flavor along with the salsas, not too much meat on them though. Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when you see Mexicans eating at a Mexican restaurant. Or at least we thought. From the outside it doesn't look very promising, but it's rather roomy inside and very colorful and lively. The servers are nice, lacking some attention to detail, but you can't have it all.  The food was pretty basic, nothing spectacular or worthy of a second visit. The Horchata was watered down and they don't give you chips, which was very strange.   The prices were fair but so was the food, I won't return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a hidden gem that I really don't want to tell y'all about. But we're talking about great food at great prices. Not Tex mex. El Nevado is more authentic Mexican. Tacos, tortas, and other stuff that I don't know. I had two carnitas tacos and two carne asada gorditas. Tacos were really good. Gorditas were killer (really, get the gorditas!!!). The green sauce has a little kick, the red sauce has a lot of heat, and the onion slaw is good and cool. It's a small place, so even if the parking lot isn't packed the inside will be pretty full. A lot of people were ordering the horchata, so it must be good, but I opted for a Modelo."}
{"text":"Asada steak taco is amazing. The queso is great, chips excellent: I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm docking a star only because they can be a little slow getting the food out. Overall, this place is a beacon of hope in the sea of wannabes that is the Mexican restaurant landscape of Charlotte.   I can't believe I've only seen one mention of the sopes. Holy crap, that's the main reason I keep coming back!!!! I dream of their sopes. Okay, maybe not. But they're amazing. And the salsas? I could probably drink every single one. Though, I'm the biggest fan of the dark red one. It's super spicy. But really, they're all a little spicy. Sensitive tongues need not apply.   Their store front is pretty nondescript. You would drive right by it if you didn't know any better. Inside is small with probably about 8-10 tables total. And, if you don't speak Spanish, you may want to brush up a little or bring a friend who does. :)  See pic."}
{"text":"After four years in Chicago, I was seriously jones'ing for a simple platter of \"carne y tres\" -style Mexican food, 'cause who can argue with a great \"meat and three\" lunch of protein, beans, rice and cheese!  (And before you say, \"But, there are amazing Mexican restaurants in Chicago!\", just remember not all Chicago neighborhoods are the same - and there's no decent, affordable \"homestyle Mexican\" in the downtown area - just Rick Bayless' empire of over-hyped Mexican joints serving $55 a plate micro-portions of grilled steak with four artfully arranged black beans)   While our friends dove into classic burritos, like the $7.50 Fajita Burrito, and the mountainous Pollo Asado ($7.99), I caved in and ordered my favorite combination; the Coctel de Camarones (Shrimp Cocktail) was enormous, and perfectly flavored with onion, lime, cilantro and that classic thick, ketchup-based sauce. The shrimp were perfectly poached and the generous topping of avocado made the entire bowl creamy. The $2.25 Lengua Tacos (beef tongue) were outrageously tender and smoky, and with a healthy dollop of their avocado sauce, a perfect match with the cool cocktail. The sweet radishes were a nice touch - very seasonal and they added a nice crunch to the soft-shelled taco.  True \"meat and three\" dining! Lucky for the folks living and visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I came here last week for tacos and that's All you can expect from this place. Authentic ok tacos!!!! If you expect a beautiful decor, clean fancy tables and well equipped staff sorry wrong place. LOL Also don't recommend coming to this side of town at night, not that safe. They only have about 5 tables. I recommend get your taco and go!!!!! There is only one waitress and she also took the orders for take out. Need more staff.  Can you believe they don't serve margaritas?!?!? Wow crazy I thought all Mexican restaurants sold them. Service is very very very slow, even after all the other customers had their food it still took 15 minutes to get only 3 tacos. I had to ask for napkins, lime and a fresh bottle of green sauce. I don't recommend using the bathroom, if they don't  clean the tables they definitely don't clean the bathrooms. You have been warned."}
{"text":"This a hidden gem on Central Avenue. They serve authentic Mexican food with love. Did I forget to say the price vs quality is unbeatable. If you ever drive by the old Eastland Mall area give this place a shot you will thank me for it. Won't mind eating chorizo tacos with everything on it on a daily basis! Delicioso!"}
{"text":"I have reached Nirvana with the delicious tacos here!  Let me be honest, this place looks a little rough on the outside, but oh my gosh, is it a gem on the inside.   I have tried a lot of places in Charlotte, but this little gen opens up when you walk in. I love that when I visited here l, the place was packed wall to wall with native Spanish speaking families.   If the natives love a place, you can be sure, you will too.   I am marking this as one of my favorite places to eat!  Yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"I'm Latina and recently moved to Charlotte. Tacos El Nevado has really good tacos.  The place isn't at all fancy and you'll only see a few people in there, but the tacos are delicious.  Try their horchata too!    La comida esta sabrosa!"}
{"text":"I was starving after getting off of the plane and happened to see this place. It had all the right signs of being a real taco joint. I do spend time in Mexico (was there last week and go back next month).   Ordered two al pastor, two carnitas and two barbacoa. I liked the al pastor even if they were not cooked on a trompo. The carnitas were ok. The barbacoa were really good and very moist (I think the meat was cooked that day).   If the carnitas would have been better I would give it 5 stars.   A word on the decor do not expect much but who cares."}
{"text":"A hidden gem, my coworkers brought me back some tacos from here one & they are delicious. I end up going and getting tacos almost once a week for lunch. The meat has great flavor and what makes it even better is that is 2 bucks a taco. I will say if you're looking for Taco Bell tacos then this is not the place for you. Because they serve very authentic food."}
{"text":"First good sign as you walk in, 95% of the patrons are of Hispanic descent.  Then you look at the menu and realize it's not your \"typical Mexican restaurant,\" followed by the actual food which is very authentic and delicious.  The prices are also amazing. Just a win."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Charlotte, hands down. After living in Los Angeles, I've become accustomed to what a good authentic taco should taste like (no offense Cabo Fish Taco). I was so excited when I found this place in Charlotte! The best taco places are the ones like Tacos El Nevado. Right off a busy street, in a strip mall, small and full of customers. No matter what time of day you step into this place, there is a line out the door. Some people pick up orders, but they do have a seating area with servers who will take your order. The wait is not too bad. And the fact that they are always busy just shows you the local hispanic community approves!   My favorites - Carne Asada/al Pastor tacos & Beef Milanese Torta (Mexican sandwhich)."}
{"text":"I was craving authentic Mexican food and unfortunately this is not the spot for it. The guacamole was basically half cilantro. My burrito was filled with burnt cheese and the rice had green beans in it. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"My favorite taqueria in Charlotte so far. Shame on you yelpers here for not finding and posting this place yet!  My torta oaxaquena was great and full of that stringy cheese that makes it so special. My pastor taco had pineapple chunks mixed in and was pretty solid as well. My recommendation, get a taco and a torta, eat half the torta and the taco for lunch/dinner and save the other half of the torta for an excellent breakfast."}
{"text":"Definitely on my top list for tacos ever. I was here on business for three days and ate here for three days in a row. The avocado sauce blew my mind. The beef tongue was okay. It needed more flavor. I had better. But all the other tacos were all delicious."}
{"text":"Tacos El Nevado will likely be one of the more borderline Authentic Mexican places you find around Charlotte, the vibe is very kitschy and mostly everything on the walls and playing on the tvs will not be in English, so don't expect chain store tex-mex. If authentic isn't your thing, know the food, the prices, as well as the portions make up for anything that may get lost in those departments.  A few things to note:   * We read in another review that they gave you 3 kinds of salsa, but then charged you for chips. We did not have this happen to us, but admittedly, we got one round of chips and didn't get offered more, but we also weren't charged for them. You do get 3 kinds of salsa.  * The language barrier (could) be mildly problematic. My wife asked if she could have charro beans rather than refried, and there was no way the waitress was going to understand the concept of 'substitution'. After a few rounds of trying to explain, we just gave up and got the refried. Although she did come back and ask if we wanted a small portion or charro beans on the side, so that was nice. Also upon walking in we asked if we could sit at a corner booth, and we were simply told \"no.\" We later noticed it was because someone was sitting there, but either way, it seemed abrupt. But again, after the person left, we were asked if we wanted to move there. So, even though that barrier was tough to breach, the employees were still very helpful, although a bit distant at times.  * The waitress (likely) won't take your credit card up after dropping your check off at the table - you go up and pay at the window. For a new visitor, you may sit there for a long time wondering why your bill hasn't moved, this is why.   * The portions are very large for the price. I got a fajita beef burrito (huge), with a side of charro beans and my wife for the beef fajitas, plus chips and salsa, along with an extra steak that just randomly showed up at the table. (We didn't pay anything for it and we were told it was just 'extra'...we still don't know if that came due to a language barrier or the fact that my wife's fajitas seemed a bit scarce on the steak) either way a nice bonus. The total bill for an entire table of food was a bit over $22, and there was another full meal of leftovers. If we went back, we would get tacos, at $2 each you could try a lot for very little.  Overall, I would recommend trying it out, the language barrier is there, but shouldn't be a deterrent, and possibly getting something a bit more out of your comfort zone if you want a more full experience. You'll likely be more satisfied with an authentic tripe or carnitas street taco here than you will be getting a more common option like a cheese quesadilla."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town for sure!!!! Knocking off one star simply because sometimes the service is slow. Overall great food and cheap !"}
{"text":"The address for this location (South Blvd) is correct but the map is not, and it isn't near the Eastland neighborhood listed.  The food was excellent, and my girlfriend and I really enjoyed our visit. We tried tacos of pastor (pork), chicken, asada (steak), and barbacoa. I wouldn't recommend the barbacoa, but all 3 of the others were simply awesome. The restaurant offers three side salsas, but the tacos were so tasty that we didn't really try them for more than a bite or two. I also ordered the torta albanileras, and it might've been even better than the tacos. The bread was super soft, and all the sandwich toppings went together really well and were high quality.  There are servers, but it almost felt like a hybrid between waiter service and takeout because you have to pay at the counter on your own and a few different servers brought out the food and checked on us."}
{"text":"I love love love their tacos!! Just like the one off the street carts they have lots of flavor and inexpensive and the ladies are great in there"}
{"text":"All I can tell you is wow must try so far best tacos I've had in Charlotte. PS if I can rate 10 stars I will"}
{"text":"Wanted to try hot dog today with my preggo wife, but they closed on Columbus day.  Switched our focus on a legit Mexican restaurant.  Drove on central as I remembered there are quite a few Mexican restaurants on the street.  Didn't rely on yelp, just pick one from our instincts.  Rule of thumb for the best Mexican restaurant:  non English store sign in a ghettohood.  Check and check.  Food is delicious and service is great.  Wait time is expected as they cook from scratch.  Definitely different dining experience comparing to taco bell, which u will get ur grande burrito in 48 seconds after u ordered it.  Will be back...  for sure..."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best tacos I've had. I got the Asada, Chicken and Barbacoa, they were amazing."}
{"text":"I went three times there at tacos el nevado, first time was good food, second time not bad but the third time, tacos were trash, only one tortilla for a taco and meat was burned and it look over dated, not good, this place does not deserve 4. I give it two"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. Great service and nice folks. I do my best to speak the small amount of Spanish I know here and they are very accommodating to two gringos every time I visit. Cervesa Victoria y dos tacos Dr tripa."}
{"text":"I still prefer the larger location on South B but this is just as good and I think they have more English speaking employees. Not sure, but I was engaged by the cashier. The server however mistook us ordering cheese dip for wanting cheese on our tacos. The mistake was delicious by the way."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Tacos El Nevado! This restaurant leaves so much to be desired.. First and foremost it's the first Mexican restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life that brings you 3 different kinds of dipping sauce but doesn't provide chips. The best thing about this place was their avocado sauce which swayed us to buy an order of chips in order to have something to eat the sauce with. Turns out they were extremely stale. ;-( We also ordered their menudo which was actually very good, and their steak tacos which tasted a bit off. The worst part of this experience was the waitress, she was extremely rude, made us wait forever, barely checked in on us and the few times she did approach us walked away before we could even tell her what we needed. Would Definitely suggest passing on this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite authentic style taco place that I've been to so far in Charlotte. Everything on the menu looked really good, but we felt obligated to get tacos on our first visit. We tried most of the tacos: chorizo, al pastor, asada, carnitas, barbacoa, and a beef/pork. All of them were delicious, but our favorites were the beef/pork, chorizo, and barbacoa. The service was really fast and very friendly. They also give you three different dipping sauces with chips. The sauces were really good on the tacos as well. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What is not to love about Tacos El Nevado? Located on Central Avenue among many other eateries this place is unpretentious, cheap, and delicious. Visited with a colleague from work and was happy when the cashier complimented my shoddy Spanish. Yummy tacos and a huge cup of horchata later - this is on my list of go-to places especially with their grilled onions and jalapeños!   Carne Asada - A Pastor - B- Barbacoa - A+  Chorizo - B+   I will definitely have to come back for a sorta sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing.. This isn't in derita... It's south Blvd @ Woodlawn. Tacos are the most authentic I've found thus far. Make sure your try the avocado sauce (light lime green color) it's great. The guac is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos in the world. These tacos are authentic and taste delicious. Brush up on your Español because very few of the waitresses know English or know it well. Which makes the experience even better. The quac is incredible. Also, they bring sauces to the table, a brown sauce, an avocado sauce and verde salsa. All are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is not fancy. It's even a little dingy. However, food does not get any better than their barbacoa tacos. I've had some of the others and it's all been good but the barbacoas rule. The roasted onion and pepper on the side are a nice touch. The avocado sauce (not quite guacamole), and the super hot red sauce are great. We live right nearby and it makes me so happy. It is also very inexpensive. Just don't expect anything fancy. Do expect yummy!"}
{"text":"I liked this a lot. Several of my close friends are from Mexico, so I'm used to the food their mothers made for us when we were young. This is the closest I've found in Charlotte. The agua de tamarindo is sweeter and less tart than I'm used to, but the salsas and the tacos were dead on. If your Spanish, like mine, is the teensiest bit rusty, there's a little bit of a language barrier, but they're super patient about it."}
{"text":"Finally! My boyfriend and I have been looking for authentic Mexican  (Honduran) food in the Charlotte area since we moved here 7 months ago. It is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place with a small but very friendly staff. The flavors are spot on. Their tomatillo salsa is perfect, the chorizo tacos were amazing. I was starting to think there weren't any authentic places in the area, so thank you, Tacos El Nevado!!"}
{"text":"Great late lunch at this small restaurant that is on South Boulevard, or as it sometimes gets called \"Burrito Way\" for all the Latin American restaurants that dot the few miles between Woodland and down to the 485 intersection. Some are better than others and Tacos El Nevado would be one of the better ones.  It's a small place, not very extensively decorated and it was surprisingly full when I arrived close to 3pm. I was brought to a table and my order taken. About five minutes later, it was served.  Three delicious tacos topped with cilantro and onions. Attractively plated with a big piece of lime and several radish slices. One beef, one chorizo and one pollo, they were excellent. Lots of meat on here, the flour tortillas held together well. The meat was tasty if perhaps a little bit small pieces.  Very inexpensive. Three tacos with a Mexican soda and tip, just over $10."}
{"text":"Food was good our first time here. The torta was plain but the tacos were great. Service is flat. We waited in line to pay and someone cut and they immediately checked them out. That was rude and disrespectful from the cashier/waitress. Also asked if we wanted to tip, which was bizarre. We already paid 23 for 4 tacos, torta, and 2 drinks. Plus, waitress did nothing but bring us our food and ignore us the rest of our time there. Other patrons were so loud and aggravating. Children were being as loud as could be. Overall, not a pleasant night out but would maybe get take out. Don't dine in."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible ! Don't waste your time here . Service is horrible .. waited over 30 minutes for food ."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Small location, but great food.   Skip the tacos and grab a huarache (large oval tortilla friend and topped with meat, beans, lettuce,etc)   Being from Mexico, there are few places in Charlotte that I've found with excellent tacos, but this is my favorite so far.   Fresh tortillas are being made constantly!   The staff does not speak excellent English, so be prepared for a language barrier.   Take me out for some tacos and I'll help you out"}
