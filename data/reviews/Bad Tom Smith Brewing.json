{"text":"Great service and great beer, watched the cavs game on one of their many wide screen tvs, Ohio city burrito was also delivered to me which was great!"}
{"text":"Cozy, nice taproom! If you like ales, stouts and lagers, you'll love their beer selection. Happy hour is great too: $5 for a beer flight, so you can easily try 10 of their beers for $10!  The best beers, in my option, were the stouts. Bartenders were friendly and really knowledgeable about the beers and were even telling us about a home brew contest they'll be doing!   My only complaint for this place was the lighting -- it was actually a little too bright for a bar, and the music was almost too quiet. Space is limited but it wasn't too crowded!"}
{"text":"Whoa, this place is the complete opposite of the Cincinnati location that's in an old auto shop with wood benches inside.  The beer is still great but this spot is all dark wood and stone, like a fancy older gentleman's basement that he goes to sip whiskey and smoke a cigar.  I don't mind the upgraded look but it threw me off a bit.  Good thing they kept the beer awesome and their bartenders friendly."}
{"text":"Bad Tom Smith appears to have done something bad while he was alive. However, he is making up for it by allowing his name to be used on some delicious beers. The space located in the Ohio City neighborhood is small but not too small. I would imagine it would be tough to have multiple large parties there. The staff was nice and allowed us to sample a few beers. Some of the beers were underwhelming but like always, I ended up with an IPA. It appears they have a good amount of events during the weeks which would be fun if I lived in Cleveland. They have a nice setup where you can order food from surrounding restaurants which is very convent. I think the only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 star review is simply my experience with the taste of beers. I will imagine beer lover will have a great time here. Come in and give it a try."}
{"text":"Bad Tom Smith is the baddest and bestest! Quiet and friendly. It's a refreshing bar to walk into in the heart of Ohio City and the staff will make you feel so welcomed. My personal favorite beer is \"Wicked Sheryl\" and wicked, she is!"}
{"text":"We walked into Bad Tom when looking for a beer in the Ohio City neighborhood. Other breweries were busy and loud and found Bad Tom to be quieter alternative. I tried the blush pale ale made with strawberries, which was a bit too sweet for my liking. I ended up with an IPA that was in the lighter side and easy to drink. Bad Tom partners with the local pizza and burritos joints to offer food to its customers. The food ordered and delivered to your table, which is a super nice service offered by the Bad Tom staff. The only food made in house is the pretzel, which we tried. It was exactly what a soft pretzel should be: warm, soft and buttery. This no fuss brewery is a good option when making your way around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The beers are good, the people are nice, the location is great....but it's so damn small.  It was a very tight fit in my option.  We went and sat in the front window area which was nice but the rest of the people was small.  Our friend is part of the beer club thing so we got some good deals on beers.  Honestly wasn't blown away but I like to support small business.  Who knows if they do well maybe they'll move to a bigger place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, great beer. They have a beer that fits every style and it's not just beer that fits the masses. I just wish they had a better food deliver option, I saw some people with food but not sure where they got it. The best thing is they support the home brewer with contest to control tap handles."}
{"text":"Going to breweries has sort of become our thing. My wife and I have probably been to about 15 or so in the last couple of months. I honestly don't think we've had a better experience than the one we had at Bad Tom Smith tonite.   We sat down on some comfy chairs by the front window expecting to have a beer and leave. Well that didn't happen.......   They had flights for only $5, I suppose for happy hour. The beers were good, but that's not the most important thing for me, the character is what counts in my book. The owner and operations manager actually came by and sat down and talked to us for almost a half an hour. It was so fun hearing their story and picking their brains a little bit.   We found out that once a month, they let a home-brewer use their equipment to produce a beer, and then put it on tap. They had a shindig going on while we were there where a Home brewer named Jordan was debuting his smoked porter, and it was really fun to be able to order it at the bar. How cool is that!  I know this may be weird, but I loved their menu. I'm a details guy, as are most people who are into Yelp I suppose? Each beer has a dedicated page on the menu where it explains the taste, gives the statistics such as IBU, etc., and has a write up about the history behind the name, and how/why they chose to brew that style.   I can't wait to bring friends here."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the space and try the beer - wasn't thrilled with either.  The space is a bit cramped (but I know they are dealing with an narrow space, but they used space in an odd way.)  Did they really need to create a separate \"store\" to hang a couple t-shirts?  They would've been better served to open that up and just stock the t-shirts on a shelf behind the bar.  The menu is a bit confusing too.  Everything is displayed on the video screens and also in the hard copy menu, but the video screen flips too quickly, and it's difficult to locate the beer type on the hard copy menu.  It took me several minutes to identify the APA and IPAs, and then to decide with one i wanted.  I ended up with an APA (Sheryl something) and it was a bit to fruity for my taste.  At the end of the day, i agree it's about the beer and since the one i tasted wasn't my 'thing', i definitely am willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"The space is quaint, not your average West 25th Street bar, so don't come here expecting that. With around 8 feet from bar to wall, it is a small space but they make it work with strategically placed bar tables (that are numerous) to prevent the walkway from being blocked.   The decor is reminiscent of an old timey bar with exposed brick both on the walls and bar.   What makes this even more different than other bars in the area, is the strictly Bad Tom Smith menu, 15 different beers all by the Bad Tom Smith brewery. Normally, I wouldn't find this to be a bad thing but with that many options, I would hope for a wider range of flavor profiles. They tend to stick with the darker beers (porter and stouts) and pale ales. I will be excited to see the new ventures they take.   I had the Kentucky Common (Doc's) that was nice and easy drink but didn't have much flavor profile, though that may be a Kentucky common standard. It was extremely drinkable and enjoyable. I also tried the Red Rye (Fink's) that was extremely strong and the flavor came through. I would commend the balance of flavors.   Starting in February, they will putting local brewers on tap with a monthly competition. This is an exciting new program unlike anything in Cleveland. The program will even allow the brewers to be have a the benefits of a big brewer while still being passionate about home brew. They will get 85 gallons vs 5 gallons at home! They accept recipes and based on the \"recipe\" of the month. February will be Stouts! At the end of the year, there will be a prize for the best beer! 40% of proceeds during the brew period will go to the brewer's charity of choice.   They also offer food, from their own Kitchen, Ohio City Burrito, and Pizza Whirl. I find this to a be really cool addition to a brewery, food for all types! With and SafeServ kitchen they use vinyl gloves making it allergy friendly! We tried a bratwurst, it is spicy! What makes this bratwurst so special is that is made with the Fink Beer. I highly recommend it, hands down the best bratwurst I've ever had. Not to mention it is artisan and Ohio made at the Cincinnati Bad Tom Smith brewery.  Highly recommended and you should get a beer and brat and enjoy your time at this quaint, welcoming taproom."}
{"text":"A great experience and pretty good beer. Came in on a Friday night and there was plenty of space. The taproom is pretty cozy, a long but pretty narrow space. The bartender was super friendly. They have like 14 beers or so on tap, a pretty large variety.  I got a flight with two ipa's, a pale and a stout. Then a normal sized Porter. Everything was pretty good and I'm definitely eager to come back and try more. It's Cinci brewery so not local I don't believe but I won't hold that against them, too much.  Would definitely recommend trying this place out. Covienient location, good prices, plenty of beer."}
{"text":"Bad Tom is not bad; in fact, it's very good.  Our first visit on a Wednesday consisted of us, and the bartender AJ.  AJ was a little bored because you aren't frequenting taproom.  Yes, you.  Not us, because we've at least been.  It's you that's the source of AJ's boredom.    But I get it.  Would know this this was a taproom featuring, you guessed it, beer, if someone hadn't told you?  That's kind of the problem.  It's nondescript.  It's in the place something else before it was that you never visited.  That's a bad combo.  It's really, really close to places you go.  We did get a recommendation.  A positive one.  And still it was our second choice.  Finding out Nano Brew was closed for the night, we stood at the corner aimlessly and said hey, I think that, wait, no, ok, yes, can you read that, no, that's got to be it.  Let down by their signage and the lack of big ole \"BEER\" sign, you kind of have to let fate take you to their front door.  The beer selection is vast.  It's brewed in Cincinnati and brought up for us Clevelanders.  If you want me to compare the IPA to other Cincy beer, it's right behind PysHOPathy and Truth.  It's probably behind Commodore Perry and Citramax.  But guess what? 5th place ain't bad.  You can also apparently bring outside food to eat while you drink their beer."}
