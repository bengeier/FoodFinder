{"text":"This Place has tons of potential located in a quiet spot down by the water in lasalle you'll enjoy a warm atmosphere friendly staff and excellent food , this is my second time back and everything is delirious and served with a smile , highly recommended for a quiet date (not if there is a Hockey game)  or just a nice place to go and have a soup and watch the sun set over the river ... best relaxed meal ever    this time i went they are having a few renovations done  ans yes it a little disordered this time we went but with things to come and the direction they are going this little hideaway will be a hidden jewel in the middle down by the water"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good breakfast served just how u want it! We order from this place very often cuz of their great delivery hours (11am to 5am) and they deliver breakfast! We've ordered other items too from here but all i can remember is we liked what we've tried. Pretty fast delivery, friendly staff if you're ordering to pick up or eat in."}
{"text":"I will never go there again. My first experience was my last. The place looked outdated and dirty. Carpets smelled bad. Took for ever to get served and the food wasn't good at all. Overall terrible experience. Sorry"}
