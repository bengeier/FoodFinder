{"text":"Not much different from the many other Edo locations I've frequented (North Hill, Marlborough, Sunridge, SouthCentre, Chinook, Deerfoot malls, Shawnessy, Midnapore, etc.) Staff is consistently friendly, store is clean. As another reviewer pointed out, staff greets customers on the way in, and often on the way out. For a while, before being recognized as a regular, the staff also came over to ask if everything was ok while I ate, as in a regular restaurant. A nice touch. Everything was always fine, so they stopped doing this, which is ok by me. Not a big fan of music during my lunch hour but they do play an inoffensive mix of 1980s stuff which is an interesting choice. Probably not to everyone's taste but since I like it I am not complaining.

Pretty much a very competently run chain restaurant."}

{"text":"This is my 3rd or 4th visit.
I usually come here when working in Cow town. 
I would never come here on own dime, as I find it quite expensive for what you get.
I usually get a bento or a rice bowl but i thought i would try something different.

For 19.99 the Futiyama is one of the pricier items on the menu. It tastes like cold sushi from Safeway or the airport so totally not worth 20.00 not for size nor quantity nor taste.

The large roll is some sort of house roll and is totally impossible to eat with chop sticks or fingers, it simply falls apart into a large mess on your plate.

All the rice on these rolls is very loose and does not stick together and all of it falls apart when you pick it up.

I gave the place 2 stars because of the rice bowls and a negative 4 for the sushi and prices."}
{"text":"Restaurant gone fast-food.  Very casual Japanese processed fast food in plastic trays with a number of very commercial looking booths.   I've always loved their food, but did they really need to \"round up\" my credit card tab?  That is only  for cash purchase people - not credit cards!"}
{"text":"If you like mall food court type food you know what to expect here. Simple quick food that comes out the same every time. I like that they have a just veggies version of their teriyaki rice entree. The sauce is always the same and probably the best part about it. 

The sushi is pretty much fast food sushi, nothing to write home about, but it's there if you want it. 

The bento box lunches are a pretty good deal for the price and amount of food."}
