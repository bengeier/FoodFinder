{"text":"The Duke of Richmond seems to be busy all of the time. It doesn't seem to matter what time it is during the day. I've been there many times with friends, workmates and with groups after networking events. It's loud and has the folks from City Hall, the shoppers from the Eaton Centre, Tourists and everything in between. 

I've looked for reasons to not like this place and I can't find one. The service is consistant and attentive despite the huge crowds. The food is good in fact, they have these little baskets of things that are great for sharing (practical and inexpensive). I think that they have 5 items for $20. I think......They have lots of beer on tap. The washrooms are clean and  on the ground level. 

** if you are with a group and need a spot to go that will accommodate a group, this is the place.** 

***Also, try the deep fried pickles (they are on the sharing/cheap menu) if you haven't had tried them before. They are a bit weird at the start and then you get into it***"}
{"text":"Ok, It's an English pub, but not much of soccer is going on there I guess. It's a decent place, good atmosphere and good price. I will go there again and it was great as a pub. The fish and chips was good. The service was so weird though, they would all coming and asking us if everything was OK, but the waitress there was kind of aggressive, and she asked us in a way that we didn't dare to say anything lol!
The other weird thing about the service was that the waitress told everyone at 7:30 PM that it is the last call for drinks. However, we knew that the pub was going to be open until 10 PM. So, I don't know why they have the last call 2:30 hours earlier than closing. We were about to leave, so it didn't matter for us."}
{"text":"had dinner with former colleagues here. ordered mini basket 3 items. great prices. good atmosphere. waitress friendly & attentive. as for food, ribs were a bit dry and small in size but still nicely flavoured. steak burger was rare and chewy unfortunately. popcorn shrimps were delish but shrimps were mini sized as well."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor food. Group of eight, waiter forgot to put in two meals, so they never came. Two others sent their meals back. Waiter was disinterested and unapologetic."}
{"text":"Great pub! Beer selection is great including a great Radler. I had their baskets (3) which were a great appetizer and the had a pulled pork taco. I just kept wanting to order more!"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give this place zero stars I would! 

Went to grab a quick bite to eat here a few Thursday ago. It was late, around 9:30 and it's right next to the Eaton Centre. We were directed to a table by our surly and disengaged waitress. We didn't order drinks (our mistake?..maybe only patrons with big bills get good service here?) Our appetizers took forever and then arrived lukewarm. Since our waitress didn't even come to check on us I didn't get the chance to say anything. For that matter had anyone of the other staff even looked in our direction, I would have. Instead we just ate what we could stomach and asked for the bill....which itself was another fiasco since it took her forever to print it out. 

Overpriced food. Terrible terrible service. 

Needless to say no tip was given.  

I live in downtown Toronto and there are many better pubs to eat at. Don't bother with this place!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how quiet and empty this place was for the USA-Portugal World Cup game yesterday. Was I missing something?!

Anyway, walking in and having the liberty of choosing our seats and the particular tv we wanted to focus on was a really welcome surprise! I love the layout of this pub, there's a variety of different types of seats, from bar stools, to cosy family booths, and an abundance of tvs, all of which are easy to see and hear, but none of which are overly obtrusive or bothersome to those who don't wish to watch what's on. Five stars for comfort!!

Our server was nice, and the manager/owner was super nice! They seemed a bit disorganised though - every time our server asked us what drinks we wanted, or if we wanted to order food, or if everything was ok, the manager/owner would follow up and ask the same question about five minutes later? Strange.

We waited quite a long time for our drinks, which was odd as the place was virtually empty. I didn't order food, as I dined here before a few months ago and found the food expensive, and not the highest quality. 

Despite the imperfections though, this place is so cosy and it was absolute bliss being able to watch the game here in such nice surroundings. 

If all you want is a drink downtown and a chance to watch some sport on tv in comfortable, quiet(ish) surroundings, then this is the place for you.

For a buzzing atmosphere and a great meal, I'd probably go elsewhere, but this is great for what it is."}
{"text":"This place deliberately over charges customers for drinks. I have been here on two different occasions and both times they serve and charge you for an expensive glass of 8oz wine without asking which size you would like. This is definitely not something that has ever happened to me at any other restaurant or bar in the downtown area. It was sneaky and rude. Because it has happened twice I can only assume that management is telling the servers to do this. 

Otherwise the food and service was fine, however I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 9/10

With the pub right across from where I work, this is the perfect spot for a Thursday night with co-workers. 

I always have a pleasant experience here. The manager, Mark, is extremely accommodating, especially to larger groups. Tip: be sure to call ahead and get a reservation if your party is larger than 6. A lot of groups book this place, especially on Thursdays, so call early!

The drink special on (Thirsty) Thursday is doubles for single prices. The bar rail is great, they do not cheap out with the alcohol.

I've had various snacks and meals here as well: fish and chips, nachos, samosas, veggie burger, all are great. The food comes promptly and hot, and everything is exactly what you are craving in a pub. 

The bottom line: you have to like pubs, but if you do, this place is GREAT."}
{"text":"A favorite haunt of my friends and I whenever we're in the downtown core. We actually make this place our go-to spot for New Year's Eve, and we've never had a bad experience.

The pub itself feels a bit of the beaten path, on a side street a couple blocks away from City Hall. It gets a bit cramped sometimes and the servers sometimes leave a bit to be desired in terms of their attentiveness, but it's always a fun, enjoyable experience. I've always made it a point to get the Fish and Chips whenver I come here, and they do not disappoint.

Very nice pub overall, and it will continue to be one of my favored stops for years to come."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Duke of Richmond. The food here was good. While the burger here is not best of breed, it was a good burger and reasonably priced. French fries were cooked to perfection here. They have a good selection of beer, both Canadian and import."}
{"text":"Happened to come upon this place needing a snack after work and guess what?! It was a Muskoka party, complete with two beer tickets each (a brand being promoted!) and passed appetizers!  Fun, and we also ordered an appetizer for our table. It began to drizzle a bit when we were on the patio, and they were lovely about accommodating us inside. There was even a gentleman playing guitar inside. Called later in the week to see if there were any other promotions or happy hour type of things, but that was a one-time thing apparently. Went here another time after work for an appetizer- consistently good pub food, served fresh and hot. Lots of fun in a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Toronto, pub wise. I feel like I'm always stepping out of Toronto and into another world.

The beer list is expansive and the food is impeccable. I know that sounds like an elaborate word for pub food but it's really as good as it gets. I normally get the 3 apps to start, deep fried pickles, sweet potato fries and the nacho sticks. Delish. Then I move onto wings or fish and chips or burgers or.... the list is endless with deep fried goodness.

For the healthy side, the salads are really great too and the portions are just right.

I love this cozy little place. I also love that no matter if you are group of 2 or a group of 6, if you want a booth, you got it. It's something small but it's significant to me.

The best time to go is before a Massey Hall concert. It's where you will find me!"}
{"text":"Standard pub. I find all these duke places are basically the same if not identical. No complaints it does the job and I've never had a bad experience. Food is classic pub grub, at a good price. Drinks there always seem to have specials which is always a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Nothing was interesting..little pricy (--\")"}
{"text":"As someone else mentioned, the half price bottles are from 11-4, daily!!

So if you fancy getting stinking and heading back to work, this is your place! Also a great idea for boozy brunch on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I came here after walking endlessly from Gerrard/Church (after the pride parade).  I was searching for a pub to watch the EuroCup final and finally found a seat in this joint.  At this point in my walk, I was incredibly thirsty and although understandably,  it was busy, no one came to serve us water for 10 minutes plus.  Eventually someone came to serve us and we ordered pitchers of sangria.  The restaurant was oddly quiet for a euro cup final atmosphere but arguably it was a pretty boring game. I ordered a greek salad and what arrived was the smallest salad I've ever seen. For a ten dollar meal, the portion was ridiculously small. Maybe I'll try a different Duke because I've heard lots of good things, but won't be going back here (even if I can't find a table anywhere else on the World Cup final)."}
{"text":"Service was sucky.
Rushed Lunch hour...hurry up!
I work next door so I ran in and out.
Mini burger and fries for $5.00... cute and pretty tasty.
Went here for lunch with G.Lau. He had a bigger burger and sweet potato fries.
It is always packed up in this place, because all the suits from the court next door frequent."}
{"text":"The main thing the Duke of Richmond has going for it is a great location (no I don't mean the fact that it's on Queen St and not Richmond St), being right in the middle of tourist central Yonge and Dundas while at the same time managing to find a location that's enough removed from the main streets that it's not constantly busy which makes it more appealing for me.

Came in here for a quick drink and snack. The first thing that struck me upon entering was that it was a lot roomier than the exterior suggests with a large bar area. They don't have a vast beer menu and I suppose for the very \"central\" location it's priced reasonably. Being a fan of Grolsch I was happy to see that they had it in bigger (450ml) bottles. 

What really kicks this in to close to a 4 star vs a 3 star review is the fact that the curried chicken rolls I ordered were fantastic, comes with a generous amount of mango chutney too. So get that if you're undecided on what to order :)

I've only been here twice, but I can definitely see myself coming back here again but only if I'm in this area as there are better options if one is willing to walk for a bit."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a beer and something to snack on before checking out a concert. One thing with being downtown is that it's hard to find spots that are off the beaten path so we settled on Duke of Richmond because there was a patio. We ended up being pleasantly surprised by the place. We ordered some pub style appetizers, nothing to write home about, but they were good with a couple pints. The staff was super friendly and attentive even as the place began to fill up inside."}
{"text":"Worst bartender ever. I understand the men lining the bar are there for you but it doesn't meant the female patrons agent worthy.  

My office spent over 1K there tonight and will NEVER go back. 

You reap what you sow."}
{"text":"Been here  a couple times and everything from service to food was what I was consider adequate. Their draught beer list could use some improvement though, as there are minimal craft options and not a single IPA when here last on the weekend! But aside from that, its a fair choice if in the Queen and Bay area."}
{"text":"Very nice pub especially when you walk in on a real cold winter day.
It has a warm feel to it in the heart of the city.
The food has always been good to me and the staff very friendly and helpful.  The various imported beers have always been bang on fresh.
Again, the food is good but the atmosphere is really what makes it for me."}
{"text":"This place is whack. Obviously. But hella whack. Waited ten minutes to even have our drink order taken. Eventually got up and left. This was at the tail end of the lunch rush, so there really was no reason for it. 

The table next to us got up and left just before us because their food took so long and they had to leave. 

The front entrance also smelled like hickey equipment. Our theory is that they drench the carpet in vinegar every night to \"clean\". 

Total dive."}
{"text":"After a long day of wondering around downtown, we decided to hit The Duke for some beer and nachos. While we were pleased with the beer selection, the nachos were disappointing. You can get decent beer and nachos pretty much anywhere in Toronto, so I was surprised to find out that theirs was not up to par. You would think if they have chicken nachos, they should also have beef? Not the case. And the chicken tasted a bit off. Not a big fan."}
{"text":"I came here one day with a friend when I noticed the half price bottles of wine at lunch time.  It was a beautiful sunny day outside and we sat in the corner on nice comfy couches and chairs in the middle of downtown Toronto.  That on it's own made this lunch fantastic.  

My friend and I thought we'd go pink, so we got the Yellowglen Pink Sparkling champagne.  It was nice and light.  For lunch I ordered the herb marinated grilled chicken.  It was nicely cooked and seasoned and came on delicious focaccia bread with a flavoured mayo.  They lose one star because while the food was good, it wasn't GREAT.  The server was attentive and didn't mind when another friend of ours joined for a bit to eat.  No problem splitting up our bills and the wine.  

This patio is awesome for people watching and good eats.  I would recommend it on a nice day."}
{"text":"My wife and I had to meet up to run an errand at City Hall and we hadn't had lunch yet so we decided to grab a quick bite here.

I had the Gazpacho which was quite good on a hot summer day on the patio. Then I had a Seafood bake. Salmon, shrimps, haddock and spinach in a cream sauce with bread crumbs on top. For $16 I expected better, it was a bit oily and nothing special.

My wife had a Southwestern style club which she said was okay and sweet potato fries which are good even when bad, like pizza.

I had cranberry and soda and my wife had an Amaretto Sour in a tall glass which she said was delicious. It looked like it was made with real lemon and lime juices.

So a soup, two entree's, two non-alcoholic drinks and two alcoholic drinks and it was $64. A little pricey for lunch in my books."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the shepherds pie, and I got steak and chips.

The shepherds pie was apparently disappointing- just a congealed microwave meal by the looks of it. 

my steak, chips and Caesar salad was good but could have used some kind of sauce.

the service was brilliant- very friendly, chatty and kind. thank you!"}
{"text":"I think I have a problem.  I know this pub is somewhat franchised.  I know it's in the Eaton Centre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/toronto-eaton-centre-toronto).  I know exactly what's on offer before I ever go in there.  But I still keep going.  There's so many times that I've been walking through the neighbourhood, get a text from a friend looking to hook up for a quick bite and I look around and see the Duke.  Ditto days of shopping when you're sick of being in any more stores that have the word \"Navy\", \"Republic\", or \"Gap\" in the name.  You need a pint quick.

The Duke of Richmond is at the south-end of the mall with entrances outside the mall.  If you get sneaky and walk through the Cadillac-Fairview Tower entrance, you can enter directly into the bar at the back.  Good details to know if you find yourself inside and not wanting to walk into (-40) deg. C weather to get a lunch in.

It's standard British fare in a standard British-style pub with a menu that is not dissimilar to the other \"Duke of\" pubs that dot the city.  It rates higher in the books in my mind because of its location (right inside the mall) and the memories that it holds for me.  When I used to work in that very tower years ago, we used to refer to the Duke of Richmond as the \"First Floor Boardroom\".  There were many meetings."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite to eat and I was very happy overall! I ordered the fish and chips, and I had a spicy caesar to drink. The food was hot and the fish was so fresh and lightly breaded, I really enjoyed it. They don't give you the usual half plate of fries you would get at other pubs, but it was actually just the perfect amount. It's also served with coleslaw. My friends ordered nachos-perfect for sharing, turkey sandwich, and casadillas. Everyone was really happy with what they ordered! I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great draft selection and the food is well priced for downtown. I usually stick to soup and salad for lunch and they never disappoint. Really friendly staff make the experience worth repeating."}
{"text":"This is our office's go-to spot & one of my favourite pubs downtown. Located on the NE corner of James St & Queen, it's easy to walk past but it's worth stopping in for drinks and a bite.
The fried pickles satisfy comfort-food cravings, and I absolutely love the nachos, battered fish & chips, popcorn shrimp, chicken tenders, sliders, and their fries, which are always perfection.
I've been looking for a place that does the big soft pretzels other than Bier Markt and finally can say I've found it! It is a must try item.
They do take-out too. I had the black-bean veggie burger and sweet potato fries with sweet Dijon dipping sauce... I'm not usually one for vegetarian food, but I definitely recommend it! 
Servers and service is always attentive and consistently go above and beyond.
Great menu and selection - I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Terrible! Service was terrible, food was terrible. It took 45 minutes to get to the table so we were very hungry and easy to please...didn't happen. Food was cold and small portion for such a large plate. Will not come back."}
{"text":"This place is so great. Nice servers, great music, nice atmosphere, huge beers and good food. My husband and I shared the trio of apps; we got deep fried pickles, cheese sticks and the mini-burger and fries, all of which were hot and tasty. The pub itself is very clean and well maintained.

Our server even let us charge our phones at the bar, which was awesome! (Our party travelled from London and all four of our phones had died.) That's just going above and beyond!

I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Overall this place is all about LOCATION. It's big and cosy at the same time, so it's a great choice for bringing a group (make a reservation, though) and I find the customer service to be quite good. The proximity to the Eaton Centre makes it easy to miss, but the menu is hit and miss. It's classic pub food, but the nachos are not the greatest (not gooey enough). Bathrooms are all on the same floor as the bar, so you don't need to worry about stairs here."}
{"text":"This place is extremely close to my work place and is a go to bar when my coworkers do not want to walk far. The thursday special is double shot on bar rail drinks which are served in a short glass. I did order a whiskey coke, and in my opinion, these drinks are definitely way too strong especially when placed in a short glass. My coke was definitely  a lot lighter then usual and I could smell the alcohol coming from it. My go to drink at this pub would be a Primm's Cup. My coworkers did order a sharing dish which was mini hot dogs which came with a side of fried pickles. 

The pickles are soo yummy. Instead of deep frying the whole pickle, they did cut it up in smaller pieces which is a lot better because you get more of a batter and juicy taste when you bit into them."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, awesome 80s music playing in the background.

We sat down, someone came right away to greet us. She informed us that kitchen is closing in 20min. I asked her if she could come back to us in 5.

Nope.

I went up to another waitress and asked if i could order some food, \"im not your server, she is\" and pointed to the girl at the bar who first greeted us.

Okay.

Ordered food. Anyway, not the best service, not the best calamari, and not the best nachos."}
{"text":"An English pub that smells too much like an American diner to my taste.  Irish dressed waitresses are not enough to make you feel like you're in a real English pub.  There is no specific character here.  Customers  are more young hockey fans than UK soccer or beer fans.  

Appetizers are good but entrees disappoint.  Still in the search for the best real Londonian pub, bangers and smash in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good British pub.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food was really good but your in a British pub so be ready for heavy rich food.  The pot pie was fantastic with a great crust.  The pretzel app and edamame app was good as well."}
{"text":"We had a team lunch here last Friday. Most of us ordered fish and chips, the half size is quite feeling, and the full version was all right if you are supper hungry. This time I decided to try chicken hot pie, really hard to find chicken since it's all mixed. Really great place for a drink."}
{"text":"It's really embarrassing to leave a pub at 5pm on a weekday totally sloshed and walk out into the mall and be confronted with parents and kids and people trying to make sensible purchases.  BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT ALL I WANT IS IMPULSE BUYS: Something to bake brie in!  Polka dot socks!  Neon-accented baby brogues!

...and I blame the Duke of  Richmond and their summertime half-off wine special.

Food is probably 3.5 stars (pub-style salads - though props for one with quinoa, standard nachos, hummus and pita, etc.), décor is cozy, service is really consistent, the pub is well-staffed, but...it's the wine that really seals the deal.  

Half-off bottles everyday this summer, 11am - 4pm.  It's the perfect place to escape to during the workweek when you can slip out on your real-life responsibilities.  

Before 4pm: GET IT IN YOU.  

Yelp note: there's a banquette at back that is perfect for 3 gabby girlfriends to hang out in (and drink wine) (and watch programming on the big screen directly facing).  DREAM DATE."}
