{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place.  Unfortunately, my friend does not know good food if it would bite him in the rear.  I ordered the baked spaghetti with meatballs.  Apparently, they didn't get a chance to nuke the store bought meatballs thoroughly before they shoved the spaghetti in the oven..  One bite of my ice cold meatball and I knew it was a mistake to eat here.  The stale, room temperature garlic breadstick didn't help with my opinion either.  The only plus is that the food is cheap...and it tastes like it."}
{"text":"We got delivery from Pizzino's while we were staying at a hotel off the turnpike.  Regular pizza is thin crust and a little on the small side, but delicious.  Liked the breadsticks too."}
{"text":"We tried the garlic pizza with pepperoni and asked for marinara on the side for dipping. Everything was delicious and the staff were great! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Offers many menu options at affordable prices.I generally order the family 12 piece meal that comes with Jojo's and fries.they offer free wiring but the dining room is sort of small, which is why they only get four stars from me."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Nothing incredible but the best that delivered to my old place off of Wyndham Ridge."}
{"text":"I usually order delivery at least once every time I'm in town; I stay at the Courtyard just down the block from them.  I've tried several other pizza places but keep going back to pizzino's.  They have a better product and are generally less expensive than the others.

Their hot wings are good; not battered, and they cover them in sauce thoroughly.  I usually get the \"You Pick\" pizza - 2 meats + 3 veggies for under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"We order from here frequently. Pizzas, chicken and subs are all great"}
