{"text":"We came here with a reservation on a Saturday evening for five and we waited up to forty minutes and we're still left without a seat. If you come to this restaurant on a busy night expecting to be valued, think again."}
{"text":"Ordinary...
Just ordinary... i had ribs with fries and coleslaw.
Nothing special about it. The ribs was well cooked but the sauce needed a little bit of flavor.
The portion was generous for a half rack baby back ribs with fries. We went there for a birthday party, the service was ok.

I tasted other stuff in the menu, like the salad (pretty boring) and the club sandwich... I gotta say that looking at the menu and for some of the food in there, the price was way too high for its quality. And there were way too many choices in the menu."}
{"text":"Honestly poor service ( very long ), the food was not good has the way I thought it would be. The waitress didn't even ask if we want drinks but we got coffee at the desert."}
