{"text":"It's my first visit after the renovations. It looks and feel much better now, clean and comfortable, no longer a greasy diner. The name on their menu says Buggy's Pub & Restaurant. 

They have a large menu including a breakfast. We went for dinner and ordered a chili bowl ($6.95) and 5pc samosas ($4.95) from their Starters menu. Both were good. The chili had a kick to it. Samosas weren't oily and had a generous filling. 

For entrees, we ordered a South Indian Chicken Curry dish ($13.95) and a Seafood Linguini ($14.11). The curry wasn't very flavourful, maybe it's been 'Canadianised'. It came with papadum and naan which I much preferred over the rice (too soft). The pasta's plum tomato sauce was lovely, fresh and homemade. The seafood is a mix of fresh and frozen and the difference between the both is huge. It would really elevate the dish if they only use fresh seafood. 

If I'm rating just on tonight's meal I would give it a 2.5 stars but I'm giving it an extra half star for the friendly service from the owner's wife. The owner came to our table to say hello too. I would return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast one morning and almost got food poisoning from  sausage that had gone bad. The service was terrible and during the middle of our meal the staff asked if we could move to a table at the back with two seats instead of four and put our newborn on the floor. 

Hopefully they can turn things around but I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Have only gone to buggy's once for breakfast but it wasn't great. Food was ok, eggs, sausage and peameal  bacon was not cooked enough, portions were big but prices weren't great. Service wasn't friendly and a little slow. I'm glad they brought me apple juice instead of the orange juice I ordered because the oj was terrible. If they didn't call it orange juice I wouldn't have known what it was. They did have free coffee."}
{"text":"Brunch in Stouffville? Go to Buggy's.  

Fairly priced, decent food, friendly staff.  This place isn't going to blow you away but I've never walked away disappointed.  

Food comes out quickly and hot.

Servers are typically a little slow to come and check up on you on their own but it isn't a big place and you can flag them down if you need something (like a coffee refill)."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast 4 times, every time was welcoming. They were quick to get me water, and gave my friends and I ample time to decide. The servers were courteous and very well mannered. I always order the Super Breakfast (3 eggs/sausage/bacon + home fries - cooked with some kind of herbs). It's breakfast, can't expect something over the top. I gave 5 stars because of the service and how I was treated during my stay.

Ps: love the potatoes!"}
{"text":"It looks so much nicer since the renovation. We went a few times for weekend brunch. Friendly service; only had the brunch menu so far. Have yet to try dinner menu. 
Will come back"}
