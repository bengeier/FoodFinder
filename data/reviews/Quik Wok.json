{"text":"Quik Wok is a new Asian restaurant that opened up in Tempe, AZ in the fall of 2008. 

I have eaten at Quik Wok twice, sampling the Kung Pao and Mongolian Style Chicken. Both were pretty good, although not super-flavorful (i.e., not spicy). The lunch and dinner combos come with a good quality spring roll and fried or steamed rice. 

The staff are friendly, the restaurant is clean and bright, and the food seems healthy and nicely portioned. The food arrives at your table in a take-away bento box, so it would be easy to take your meal with you. Quik Wok also has an iced tea machine that dispenses 4 kinds of iced tea using an electronic selection panel. I've never seen that before. Very new-fangled. ; ) 

I'll keep going back to try new things. There are some Vietnamese items on the menu, so I'll try those next!"}
{"text":"I had only eaten here one time, because Jeff T. is my friend and when we had this food him and my boyfriend and another of our male friends all got poop-sick. I did not have that issue. But we didn't order it again because of that. Then last night I ate here again with Nicole T. cause I guess she likes it three stars worth. However. it was too spicy to eat. I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food so it probably wasn't spicy at all.  I paid 10$ for one portion of too spicy chicken and some hot and sour soup (also too spicy) and that seems like too much. Plus we went in to the store, and the walls are bright yellow and bright green and have NOTHING hanging on them. That is creepy and I don't like it. I also don't like the thick plastic containers they serve the food in. I don't really know why, but I don't like them. Just order silvermine if you are hungry and drunk. I have never had good delivery chineese food."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered delivery from this restaurant last night.  Their menu was intriguing; basically, you pick your meat and then you get like 15 or so options on how you want it (kung pao, crunchy walnut, etc...).  There was a deal on a flyer we got that said it feeds 4-5 people.  We went with that as I love having leftovers available for lunch the next day whenever we get Chinese food.  My husband went with the orange shrimp after reading the rave review on here and I went with crunchy walnut chicken.  It also came with white rice, egg drop soup, and pork lo mein.  We ordered 2 eggrolls as a side because the meal didn't come with any.  Sounds like a lot of food right?  Wrong.  $30.00 + tip later, we got the smallest portions I have ever seen.  If you split the dishes between 5 people, each would get about 3 bites of each dish and a child's sized soup.  Not much.  Hope you're not actually hungry if you plan on eating here.  Unless you're willing to fork out a lot of money for extra 'dinners' .  The lo mein was a weird goulash of different noodles and just wasn't good at all.  The shrimp were huge (about the only good thing about this dish) but super spicy.  Not your average orange shrimp; the sauce had no orange flavor.  Come to find out, the orange flavor is in slices of orange peel in the dish.  Hello pesticides.  Not a good dish at all. 
What to say about the chicken...*sigh* My husband said it reminded him of Jack in the Box...which I thought was crazy until I bit into it and realized he was right.  Definitely didn't 'taste like chicken'...and the creamy white sauce looked nasty...AND the walnuts tasted like dirt.  It was so bad, that even though I was starving, I threw it out and opted to eat the white rice with some soy sauce to try to fill my belly up.  Even my husband who will eat almost anything said he couldn't finish it.  The eggrolls were super tiny and also not good at all. What a shame.

On the upside, the soup was actually good.  Oh, and delivery WAS fast...probably because we are the only ones in the greater Tempe area ordering from this place.  Now I know better.  Think twice before ordering here...I'd go for Happy Food or Hunan Express if you want chinese in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I am still searching for a good Chinese place in my area, that delivers. This place is acceptable. The Orange Beef was fine, there was way too much breading, and it was barely spicy. The prices and portions are good, though, and the crab puffs were pretty good. The only caveat is that it has a small delivery area."}
{"text":"quik wok, you lured me with your close proximity and adorable flyer.  i ordered from you once before, my fiance got sweet and sour chicken (pretty hard to ruin that) and i ordered kung pao beef, extra spicy with no veggies.  upon arrival, which was indeed, \"quik\", it smelled delicious. i was ever so excited to consume my meal.  upon the first bite of \"beef\" i realized that the extra spicy portion of my meal was simply...hot and sour soup poured over the meat. not so wonderful. the crab rangoons are not at all crabby. i decided it would be better for us just to not see each other anymore.

queue tonight...we're hungry. we don't want pizza. oh wait, there's quik wok, maybe this time won't suck as bad as last.
well, my \"beef\" did in fact taste better than last time. however, they did not grasp the concept of NO VEGGIES, i abhor veggies. there were maybe 10 smallish pieces of meat in a sea of water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and carrots. this is not what i asked for! 
in conclusion, i would advise ordering from this establishment only if truly desperate.
for mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken and crab rangoons...$24.66. if they'd followed instructions, not served questionable meats and actually been friendly, this wouldn't have been a problem. 

I WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER ORDER HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive, but I've been there many times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Feeling hungry after watching some food tv, I had a craving for some Chinese food. My usual ordering place that is Golden Eggroll was closed unfortunately, which led me to ordering from Quik Wok. I went through the reviews and saw that it was okay Chinese food, but I figured I should try it for myself. In their defense, I ordered around 9:15, so it was 45 minutes before they closed. 

Right from the start, the $12 dollar minimum almost put me off.

Being hungry and craving something won out the minimum though.

I went with spring rolls and the dinner order of orange chicken. The spring rolls weren't too bad. I thought the sauce was a little bland and the rolls looked a little saturated with oil, but not bad. They still held their crunch and the filling held together. I look at my chicken and immediately think that they gave me bbq pork. I love bbq pork anyway... and open up the container... 

They cut the chicken into strips. 

Why is that a problem? The problem with that is the chicken was too thin and once it was done cooking, became really dry. I read from another review that there was too much breading, but I found there was very little to speak of. There was no crunch, just a soggy outside with dry inside. Looking at it again right now, it really looks closer to stewed chicken feet that you can get from any good dim sum restaurant. I love chicken feet, but when I wanted orange chicken, that's really off putting.

 The 'fried rice' was pretty insulting since it looks like white rice colored by soy sauce. There's very little egg to it and there's no vegetables of any kind mixed with it. The soy sauce is the only clear flavor I could taste and it was overwhelming.

What did I like from this place? I liked the person on the phone, he sounded like a really nice guy. I liked the containers from the place, you can definitely wash them out and reuse them. The delivery was really quick also. They said 35 minutes and they were here in about 15. 

They really need to cut costs somewhere and put it back into the food. I like cheap Chinese as much as the next person, but it's lower quality than Panda Express, and costs more too. I wish I went to the Panda Express at the Groves, then I would have saved $6 and had a better meal.

They're getting two stars for the service and because I ordered close to closing time. If I ever order from them again (very unlikely), I'll try during the lunch rush instead."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently. It's pretty good, but not the best, and there's other places I'd rather order from, as far as food quality goes.

The orange chicken was okay. The sauce was too heavy on the soy flavors, and not enough orange for me. The breading stayed on the chicken, which a lot of places seem to have a problem achieving. Heat level was fine; I like spicier, but it was more spicy than most Chinese places around Tempe so I was happy. The fried rice was fine, maybe a little greasy. The spring roll however was excellent. I really enjoyed the flavor of it, and the texture of the roll was great.

My boyfriend wanted to try tofu. I've had tofu before and didn't like it - it's a texture thing for me. He thought it would come fried. It didn't. The tofu was cut into triangles and then just covered in the sauce, basically. We got sesame, and the sauce was fine, but neither of us liked the tofu. However, since we aren't tofu people, I don't know if it's because it was bad tofu or just because we don't eat tofu normally. So I didn't factor it into my rating.

As for service, I thought it was excellent. The guy on the phone was great, and friendly, even though I kept messing up the order and had to change a couple items. So, patient also. The delivery guy was also nice, made small talk, was all smiles. 

Yes, if you order over the phone with a card, they do take more security information than usual. Obviously this business has been burned in the past from people using fraudulent card info, and so they're just covering all their bases. They didn't take down my license number or ask my father's name (??), they only took down the security code on the back, and also took an imprint of my card at delivery time. By asking for the security code and taking the imprint, they have a record that the physical card was used to make this purchase, so nobody can later claim their card was stolen or something. I don't begrudge a company some security measures, and if it really is a big deal, then yeah, pay with cash.

Overall, I was pleased with the service, and the food was adequate. Not my favorite orange chicken ever, but passable, and they are open later than any other Chinese place. (Delivery til 1am on Friday and Saturday!)"}
{"text":"Decent for the price. It did not upset my sometimes-sensitive stomach. Steamed rice was not hard or runny. I wish they would include some traditional Chinese vegetables with their entrees. I was disappointed with only rice and meat."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is now out of business.  With my previous experience, I can definitely see why."}
{"text":"Loved it. Very pleasant surprise. You should check it out. They need to work on the interior, but honestly it was the food that I was there for (being hungry) and I was impressed. I had the Sesame Chicken and my sister had the Kung Pao Chicken. She did have to ask for peanuts but I blame that on a world full of peanut allergy panic."}
{"text":"My typical cheap Chinese place is no more and when I remembered I had this flier on my fridge today and was in dire need of some comfort couch food, I reached out to them for help.

They did not disappoint. The take out menu they have is so simple and well organized it's unbelievable. I was told it would be 35 minutes which is reasonable. Imagine my excitement when they arrived in 18!! On top of that my food was very well packaged and organized. 

The garlic chicken isn't as spicy as I was hoping for but was still good and a perfect portion. The wonton soup was delicious too and more than I could eat. The steamed pork dumpling appetizer which is usually fool proof was just okay.

We'll see how many \"after affects\" I have. The big down side I saw so far as the $12 min order. I had to order 3 items for my lowly self and only finished one.

Oh yeah, and this is my 100th review yay :)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine ordered Quik Wok while we were staying in watching tv one night. Our food came rather quickly (wasn't really paying attention), and we all sat down to eat. The food came in a nifty plastic container (which I washed out and is on my tupperware shelf) and I started off with the spring roll which was pretty good. Next was my meal, orange chicken and rice. Usually you come across the problem of too much rice, not enough meat, but I had the opposite problem of a lot of meat and a smaller portion of rice. No complaints from me though. Definitely worth trying again, one of the better \"quick\" Chinese places in Tempe."}
{"text":"The one star is in memory for the guy who USE to work there and make deliveries. I guess he got bored with no customers coming in.

I've eaten from there a lot and, again, it depended on who's cooking. With the other guy gone, the Asian owner just can't be trusted.

The last time I was there, he gave me HALF a small box of rice. Not filled to the top or bulging like most place give you -- this was half full. Is white rice that expensive?

Today I decided I'd give it one more try. I took a coupon for two lunch specials and went in. Although the menu says \"lunch and dinner combos available all day,\" the owner told me he couldn't let me use the coupon. I \"wok-ed\" out...quickly. Bye-bye!

Luckily I had heard of TOTT Asian Diner on McLintock and Guadelupe (next to the Starbucks). THAT was good!

So, Quick Wok  -- General Tso long to you!"}
{"text":"Prices = too much for what it is
Food= Fresh / yummy
Delivery= Quik!

My main complaint is the stomach problems I got after I ate it. I have given it 3 shots. Each time I ordered something different with the same outcome. My friends experienced the same stomach problems (dont want to get into details). 

I wont eat there again.."}
{"text":"Lunch here today with 5.5 co workers..  (one guy got called back to the office, so we brought him food..  For some reason his was extra spicy..  :)  )

Good, not great food.  Solid for the price.  About $6.50 for Kung Pao Beef, fried rice and a egg roll.  Had a coupon for a free drink.  I would order it again.

Staff was friendly.  The place itself is rather plain.  No real decor, TV, music or anything..  

2 co-workers said the orange chicken had too great of a breading to chicken ratio, but good flavor none-the-less.  The Mongolian chicken was also well reviewed, even by the guy's who was ++spicy...

They do deliver."}
{"text":"Don't bother eating here. I sure didn't!

Dropped in on my lunch break to give this place a whirl.  Place was empty and no one was in a hurry to greet me.  I placed my order with the sack of potatoes who came out and stood there silent as I browsed the menu.  He informed me that he would start making my order, but couldn't ring me up until \"the boss\" came back.  Came back from where?  It was the middle of lunchtime.  You're telling me whoever is in charge up and split and left obviously inept employees to hold the fort down, unable to take payment?

I had ordered my food to go.  Meanwhile, another customer comes in and the clerk gives him the same story.  Luckily for him, he orders his lunch for here and is served within about 10 minutes.  Shortly thereafter my food comes out of the kitchen, the guy places the bag on the counter, and he shoots me an awkward look.  The time is now around 12:20.

I'll cut to the chase.  I get up and leave around 12:45.  No \"boss\", no food.  What a waste.  The whole experience left me wondering why this place is even open, seeing as how they can't even handle the most basic functions of a restaurant.

I had Burger King instead.  At least they want my money."}
