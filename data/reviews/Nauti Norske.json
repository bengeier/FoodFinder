{"text":"Fantastic little bar/restaurant. Awesome beer selection. Lots of beer from Wisconsin, with a selection from Iceland! Best bar in Stoughton!"}
{"text":"Sat outside and loved it.  Beautiful setting and as it got cooler we moved around the firepits for a little warmth!  Great food and service."}
{"text":"Cara- Delicious burgers but the  wait for our food was kind of long.  The best fried pickle appetizers."}
{"text":"Great location on the river. Nice people, beautiful patio. Food always tastes great. A must visit when in Stoughton"}
{"text":"What a fun local place!  We went for the Prime Rib last night.. It was excellent food a friendly, fun atmosphere with great service. The prime was cooked perfectly ( med rare) and the mash potatoes were better than homemade.  Dave made us feel like we were family and was so warm and welcoming! This was not our first time at the Nauti Norski and it will not be the last!"}
{"text":"Go for the patio....but don't expect much more.  The patio is nicely appointed, a relaxing oasis with umbrella tables and shade trees right on the river.   Service is...well, servers do not know what liquor or beers they carry.  Food is basic bar food...rather tasty...but nothing special.  Still worth it if you are hungry.  Beware, I saw servers taking out the wrong food to tables at least twice when I was here.  Stick with beer as even with their doubles you are still drinking pop. This place could be so much...but it's almost as if they think that having a nice patio means they don't have to do anything else but have people give them money.   5 stars for ambiance....3 stars for food and service....1 star for drinks."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere other the same old places we frequent in McFarland and Madison to have dinner this evening.  We decided to go to the Nauti Norske based on the positive Yelp reviews.

I am adding another positive review!

Although it was lightly sprinkling outside, we chose to sit on the patio near one of the many firepits (which are very nice) table with a large umbrella which kept the sprinkles away from us.  The patio area behind the restaurant also has two covered patios - one which has a table which seats 8 under it, and the other which has many smaller tables, a longer bar/table with modern metal barstools, and a flat screen TV.

As for the menu, this is upgraded bar food.  Vegetarians will not find anything more than some appetizers like jalepeño cheese curds or fried dill pickle spears, a cheese pizza or the all-veggie house salad.  The burger and pizza selections are large and varied.  

My daughters shared an order of jalepeño cheese curds, which were delicious and had plenty of heat.  The three of us shared the Loaded 12\" pizza.  It had thin, but not too thin, crust with pepperoni, sausage tomatoes, onions, black olives and green olives.  We opted to not have the peppers that are normally on the pizza.  I also ordered the large house salad which contained a couple types of lettuce, cucumber slices, cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced red onions.

For all of that food and one soda the bill was just under $30.  Service was attentive but not overly so.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

The inside of the restaurant looks really neat.  We will eat inside next time to check that out."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. There was some kind of class reunion going on so there wasn't really much room to sit. We really enjoyed the patio and the manager/owner seemed really nice and welcoming, although I can't say the same for the waitress we had. She didn't seem happy at all. It took a really long time to get our first order of drinks but after that everything was pretty smooth. The food was not great. Wish there was more options for vegetarians. Literally salads. I'd recommend at least some kind of black bean burger or something. Not really impressed menu wise."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday night with a party of three. There were open tables and the owner greeted us as we walked in. We seated ourselves and waited. And waited. And waited. I went up and got menus FROM THE OWNER. And went back to our table and waited. And waited. And waited. 15 minutes later, still with open tables, the waitresses had walked past us a dozen times without even a glance in our direction. We bailed.

Given that the owners were present and greeting folks going in and out, I attribute our lack of service to their not knowing how to properly manage their staff. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere- completely different than what I thought from the outside. My group of 3 sat in the back overlooking the whole place. It wasn't busy, a few people at the bar and 3 tables including ourselves. We ordered and waited. And waited. About 45 minutes had passed. Our waitress was very nice, but failed to communicate with us or apologize for the wait. In total it was a little over an hour wait in an uncrowded restaurant. The food? It was okay. I'll maybe try again in the future."}
{"text":"Wonderful outside patio. It's really nice to sit on the river and enjoy a few drinks with friends. It's a shaded area with a beautiful stone patio right on the water. While we were there someone pulled up in their pontoon boat and parked right at the Nauti Norske dock. The beer was cold and the service was great. We had appetizers and they were delicious as well. I recommend this place for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm the first one to review this place. First off, the previous bar in this spot was a dump. The difference now is night and day. The inside is full of beautiful wood and clean as a whistle. The outside? Well, it's got to be one of the most beautiful outdoor water settings in the area. Wish I had gotten here earlier so I could have provided some good pics, but maybe next time. Owners are cool and go out of their way to engage the patrons. Haven't had a chance to try the food but I'll get to that next time. If you're in downtown Stoughton, make a point of stopping here."}
{"text":"I love the Nauti Norske! Such a nice little spot! 

This building used to be pretty run down. When the owners of the Nauti came and gave everything a complete overhaul, it was as if it were a brand new bar sitting in the old one's spot! 

The inside has been tastefully redone and decorated. Very nice. 

The outside, however, is the really crowning glory. It is beautiful! There is a multi-level patio complete with fire pits (yes, multiple!), tables and chairs throughout, lighting, heat-lamps for cooler weather, and the pier on the river for those who want to stop by via boat. 

On top of a beautiful space to enjoy, the food is super delicious, too! I was there just yesterday for a birthday celebration and the kitchen was pumping out delicious sliders and pizza, among other things. 

This is a really nice spot for locals of Stoughton, and I am even willing to make the drive from Madison to hang out here! Definitely worth checking out!"}
