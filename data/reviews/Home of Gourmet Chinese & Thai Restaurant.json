{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant.  Caveat:  The delivery person had a really hard time finding my place, so the delivery was an hour late.  Any food would suffer from sitting for an hour.  Having said that, the Egg Fu Yung with Tofu, Pad See Ew, and General Tso Tofu were absolutely cooked beyond the point of death.  The strangest rubbery texture I have yet seen.  Vegetarians beware."}
{"text":"This is the worst chinese food I have ever had in my entire life. I ordered the sesame chicken combo which came with fried rice, egg drop soup, and an egg roll. The egg roll was fine, the egg drop soup was slimy and so thick it seemed like a gravy not a soup. The fried rice was your standard rice but the CHICKEN was where I was DISGUSTED. It was all fat and gristle cooked beyond the point of recognition and there was hardly any white or dark meat to speak of. I ate all of the rice and egg roll, one sip of the soup and one piece of chicken. A total waste of money. I also doubt they could pass any health code inspections because this chicken was NOT chicken."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 chinese dishes from this restaurant. It was AWFUL. The food had no flavor and the meat tasted horrible. I ordered authentic Chinese dishes, but it was awful. I do not recommend at all. I couldn't eat two of the dishes and the third one, three cup chicken was decent, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an amazing lunch special. At the time of writing, its 5.50 for takeout or 6 for sit in. You get a box with rice and two heaping servings of entrees. You know its good when the line is so large it coins around the entire restaurant. Don't get scared away though, the counter operates with great efficiency and dishes out tons of food. The dishes can be very hit or miss, but they're usually quite good. I have had problems with dishes being extremely salty. As expected for a takeout chinese restaurant, each dish is approximately 1/5 oil."}
{"text":"I love this place. The name is so quirky too, which is what originally drew me in. The restaurant is set up cafeteria style, with employees serving around 10 different dishes some of which rotate. 

The braised fish, egg and imitation crab dish, jalapeno chicken, and baby bok choi are wonderful. You get a choice between a large portion of rice or a rice noodle dish to go with it. Oh, and not to mention they have the BEST General Tso's I've ever had. it's not all made of the batter and sauce like most places. You actually taste the chicken here. 

It is sooo cheap, and you get a mountain of food. I can never finish all of mine! The ladies serving are so friendly as well. If you want, you can ask for a bowl of egg drop soup in place of a drink.

There is also a large menu on the wall if you're willing to wait for them to cook you something fresh, but I've always been too drawn in by what I see when I walk in to bother with that."}
{"text":"ZOMG this place is a UIUC mainstay. It is fairly cheap and you get lots of asian food. To be fair the food can be greasy but it's college, you probably get worse in the dorms.

Chicken Pad Thai with no egg? GAME OVER. HoG wins."}
{"text":"While the smoothies are good (especially the banana) their food and service is less than desirable. I have tried to like this place and give it multiple chances, yet every time I left wishing I went somewhere else. Every time (no joke) they have messed up my order. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and is much improved. Huge crowds, but fast takeaway service."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch. It's chipotle style where you pick rice or rice noodles with 2/3 toppings. The food is similar to what I'd eat at home, so I really enjoy it. Good amount of vegetarian options as well! 

The tomato and egg is awesome!"}
{"text":"I worked here for a few months (August until two days ago).  I was fired on a very contrived reason - I think it was because this place doesn't get enough business.

Location is pretty bad for visibility, even if it's convenient to campus.  Food is very average, but I like it more than, say Panda Express.  My parents run a restaurant so I have experience (which is why I was hired in the first place) - this is one of the most inefficiently-run restaurants ever.  The vegetable dishes are good, though, and the Chinese-language menu is generally good quality if you don't mind a wait.  The bosses both cook when necessary, but it's best to come during weekdays, when the main cook is in.  The hot pot is also fairly popular, but most of the meats are frozen.  Other things that are frozen include the \"Wheaten Foods\" menu (potstickers, wontons, and meat buns).  I think that's pretty SOP here in CU, though.

Portion sizes are okay.  They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there.  I won't analyze pricing, because I'm not used to eating out, but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced.

Things to not get include the highly-Americanized items on the menu, especially those with breaded chicken in them.  The quick lunch was phased out mostly - now it's a selection of two Chinese braised dishes, so they keep pretty well (and have an average turnover).  Instead, they now offer \"Combos,\" which are your standard rice and a main dish, with an egg roll.  They used to give a soda with these, but now only offer iced tea, hot tea, or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup.  Don't get the soups (including noodle soups) or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls (they're decent but nothing special).  Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens (P10, IIRC) are frozen, but I think they're probably okay if you don't mind them defrosting/reheating via microwave.  The smoothies and bubble tea are a no-no - they're edible and not too terrible, or so I hear, but go to Evo's or some other place for these; the slushies are okay if you don't mind a lot of sugar.  Most customers seem okay with the fish, but it doesn't look too great to me (aka it smells, and fresh fish doesn't).  To qualify that last statement, it doesn't reek like rotten fish, but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one (I bass fish at home and clean my own catch) - plus, while it's inevitable, it's frozen and quick-defrosted (aka in the sink, in a water bath with direct contact, rather than through a bag).  Hardly sanitary).

Like some other reviews have stated, they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients, equipment, etc.  Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East, and I'm not sure when other ingredients come in.  However, I'd say to come on Friday, because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday (I only worked TR lunch and Sundays, so I can't say for certain).

A few big points about the owners' behavior (which they also try to instill in the workers): first, they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment, never mind if they have all the ingredients ready (usually this is because it's busy); secondly, they do cut corners, as aforementioned.  Another thing that most people probably aren't too concerned about because they aren't very aware of it, is the matter of the \"special soup.\"  They only give it to regular customers, but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese-speaking customers.  If you're not Chinese/speaking-proficiency or a repeat customer who asks, tough luck (I've seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as \"soup Nazism\").  A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don't have, especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they're too busy to bother with your order.  Normally this happens with drinks (they keep changing their Combo meals, and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn't want to stock up); they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they're busy.

Basically, they have an undersized facility, an undertrained staff (one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going), an undersized staff, and basically a very mediocre business model.  I'm kind of astounded they've survived, but if you know what to get, you can get a pretty decent meal here.

To conclude, there aren't a lot of repeat customers, but they try to treat the ones they recognize well.  However, I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday, and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there.  I'd say they made a good choice (Cravings has much better service, food, and atmosphere).  Other good Chinese restaurants in the area, in no particular order, include Mandarin and Lai-Lai.  The Wok in Mahomet is legendary among the Chinese on campus, but that's another story"}
{"text":"I love HOG, I can't say that enough. 
Sure, it looks kind of crummy from the outside, but don't be deceived, it is a great hidden diamond of goodness. Easily best Chinese on campus (yes, even over cravings).
Go there for the lunch and dinner specials, you get two entrees over rice or noodles for 5.50. It's only 50 cents to add on another entree. Listen, they don't mess around with the portions. They give you A LOT of food, for so little!  And it's damn good food too. This is my strongest preference! Everything I've gotten here I've liked. The dishes are all put together well. 
If you're a scared baby get the orange chicken or kung-pao whatever dish they have during the lunch/dinner special. When you want something more go for the spare ribs, green beans, and pork meatballs. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Best AUTHENTIC restaurant on campus. This is your place if you're craving down to earth genuine Chinese food. This place tops Cravings (which is pan-Asian, not necessarily Chinese) by a long shot. Some favorites that come to mind are Hot & Spicy Chicken and Fish Fillets w. Spicy Chili Sauce. The place is not the biggest, but gives you an authentic representation of Chinese dining. Service is just decent, but the tastiness of the food is what secures this place five solid stars. I've been coming to place regularly, and I've had extensive backgrounds with Asian food. Trust me when I say this place is good -- and amazingly cheap."}
{"text":"You're really better going to Panda Express for Chinese food. I find it ironic that they call their restaurant or food \"Home of Gourmet\". Couldn't be farther from the truth. The rice was mediocre and the sweet and sour chicken was burned. My egg role was inedible because it was burned. I would never return and won't recommend them. GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Eat here. Eat everything here. Or don't eat here. Come here don't eat, sit, and watch everyone else eat their deliciousness while crying. Leave. Come back the next day and do it again. Do it the next day. The next week. The next month. Go home and think about your life. Go to the gym. Study for an exam. Do everything to not think about the food. Walk drunkenly past and sober up at the sight of it. Then collapse. Curl up against the door of the place whose food has inhabited every facet of your life. Wait sleeplessly for dawn. Crawl in the second they open the door and point quivering at anything on the menu. Wait the eternity for the gift from above to get to you. Then take the first bite and let your life end in a thousand dashing, fleeting moments of emotion. Leave and never be the same again."}
{"text":"This place has what I call elementary school cafeteria cooking which is not the best food but it is something I can eat every single day. This is THE most authentic Chinese restaurant on campus. Some people say that this place is not sanitary but I think their food is always fresh and that is a quality not easily found at many Chinese restaurants on campus."}
{"text":"Solid food at an economical price. One of the best Chinese restaurants on campus. Also massive portions."}
{"text":"A chowhound sort of place, HOG has some good food and some horrible food. The problem is that the menu is so undecipherable that it's hard to make good choices. Word of mouth is the only way to go here. When I went the luck route I ended up with Tom Yum that seemed to contain pieces of wood. When I relented to a friend's suggestion, I had the most wonderful savory cumin beef with cilantro. 

Not so great ingredients and they skimp on some major components of dishes (the pad thai looks like noodles with some sauce and meat...and nothing else), but occasionally you can get good things here."}
{"text":"I went to eat at this place when I was in town- the traditional menu is incredible.  The place is small, but man the food is AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can we say gross? I had their quick lunch -- 2 entree combo for 6.50, and omg it was horrible. It's not as if I had high expectations.... I just wanted something edible for lunch! The fried rice is super soy-sauced and brown (which is not the way it should be). The orange chicken was nothing like Panda Express (an Americanized Chinese chain out West). Literally, I went orange eating it. Sadness."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and portions are extremely generous for the price. The place may look a little janky but defintely worth stopping by. Usually a 2 combo platter with rice or noodles (mei fun) can make you pretty stuffed. They also have a wide variety to choose from. Never tried their entrees but the platters that you pick from are always delicious."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite Chinese places in C-U, and it's just a tiny place with a few tables.  Not expensive at all.  I think there was a Chinese grandmother in the kitchen, lovingly preparing meals to be served, but even if not that's how I felt after eating here.  Good lo mein, and more recently they've added Thai entrees.  Most dishes are vegetarian."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time, ordered online but when I went to pick up my food they informed me that their online ordering system was having problems and they didn't receive my order. Good service other than that.

I had the chicken pad thai which was not that impressive, the noodles were pretty dry and there wasn't much taste. If you're looking for good pad thai on campus I recommend going to Basil Thai. 

The only good thing about this place is that the portions are huge, I was barely able to eat half of my serving, and it only cost me $6, so that's a huge plus if you're looking for cheap food."}
{"text":"This place is a real mixed bag. None of the food is spectacular, though. I find some of the basic vegetable dishes to be ok (like the stir fried vegetables and home style tofu). However, I avoid meat here like the plague. Every dish I've had here with meat in it was strange and unedible. I stick just to a few basic things, and it's ok. At least it's cheap. Also, it's not a particularly pleasant place to dine in, it's a real hole-in-the-wall. The location on Daniel street is pretty awful (it's next to Kams and another bar, and the stench on the streets is beyond disgusting...I won't get into it). I just hold my nose on my way here every time. The people who work here are friendly, though."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch place! The venue is not the cleanest and the food can be a little too salty, but cannot get a more filling, delicious meal for its price anywhere on campus. I come here all the time when I don't have much appetite. 
Keep in mind that it's closed for a good part of the summer months."}
{"text":"I've been here again since my first review. Instead of the rice, I got noodles-- much better choice. I got the green beans which are as good as ever. I also got the  mapo tofu which was good as well. I tried the beef and chicken and I still think the meat tastes strange, but now I'm starting to think it's the seasoning. The chicken wasn't totally gross this time!"}
{"text":"EW.

(To be fair, I've only tried Thai entrees, but they are SO BAD.)"}
{"text":"Taste: 3.5
Hygiene: 2
Service: 0

Although I used to like their food, general service was always terrible. Now their price increased, and quality of food are terrible."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place down here. They have countless options and their menu is large, seeing that it spreads across half the damn store.

I am a fan of their authentic Chinese food, but their non-traditional Chinese food is even better and this is the only place in Urbana-Champaign that reminds me of Chinese restaurants in Chicago. And that's a good thing for HOG.

Their fried rice is amazing as always, I usually get the Shrimp or Combination and the entire staff there is friendly. Gotta love this place. If you haven't visited it yet, you should."}
{"text":"To reiterate what has been said a couple times already, NEW OWNERSHIP/MANAGEMENT. Over the summer of 2012 they completely gutted the kitchen and put in all new appliances according to the owner. Home of Gourmet should be considered to be on par with the other respected Chinese venues on campus. In fact, six years ago the current owners of Home of Gourmet once operated Cravings and they they sold cravings to its current owners

The lunch and dinner serving styles are different. Both are extremely good deals. Lunch is served like a school cafeteria with 6-9 entrees offered that alternate daily. 2 entrees + a ton of white rice + free drink = $5.50.

Dinner is fantastic. Variety on the menu is incredible; over 100 different dishes offered. Portion sizes are huge and i think prices are extremely reasonable especially considering 2 people can share most entrees (from the Chinese menu) as a complete dinner. Free Hot Tea.

My favorite dishes: The stir fried green beans are unbelievable. They chili oil fish is fantastic if you like spicy food and fish. The \"Indonesian fried rice\" is identical to the jakarta fried rice from cravings. Ma Po Tofu has a truly authentic mala spicy taste. The employees are very willing to tweak any dish to any preferred taste.

Downsides: Small venue so it gets extremely crowded noon-1 and 6-7."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I have been here a few times and it bothers me that the lady at the register never says thank you or even good bye. It is a little rude."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here for dinner takeout last night.

Wow!  I was super impressed.  I ordered off the \"authentic\" (?) Chinese menu that hangs above the counter, getting the dry garlic-flavored fish (h12 on the menu).  The fish was nicely fried and covered in lots of little bits of near-charred garlic, ginger, and onions.  It was delicious.  When we go out to eat we usually want to try a bunch of things (and have leftovers), so my husband got lemongrass beef.  If you like peppers, that is the dish for you.  The beef was very peppery tasting, but the lemongrass added a deeper flavor, too.  In spite of not particularly enjoying peppers I found myself stealing bites.

As other reviews have said, the portions are large and inexpensive.  Two people could easily eat here for $7.  

The restaurant is small and it was crowded when we went.  I'd recommend takeout."}
{"text":"Just bad.  I've been their twice now and both times I regretted it.  The second time I went there, I ordered some chinese vegetables (we intended to get bok choy, but we said the names of a few other chinese vegetables and they ended up giving us one of those).  The chicken dish I got was just bad, extremely oily and americanized, and not what we wanted at all.  The veggies were good and like what you can get at any real chinese place, and maybe if you order all of your dishes in chinese you can actually get something more legit, but the stuff they are going to serve to normal everyday non-chinese-speakers is bad."}
{"text":"we can no longer call this place HOG...since they added the Thai.
Delivery is nice.  Tofu Pad Thai, not so nice.  Lacking a few of the standard components.  Also super hot, like it cleared out my sinuses hot.
Next time i'll stick to some standard Chinese fare."}
{"text":"I've heard that this place is now under new ownership, but I never tried it under its old ownership.  I've come here three times now and am excited to add it to my Campustown rotation.  The owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating, and are more than happy to explain dishes to us westerners.  As my friend Matthew G. noted, lunch is served cafeteria style, while you order dinner off of the menu.  The lunch is a great deal, with 3 entrees and rice for about 6 or 7 dollars.  I've been trying to order the more authentic dishes on the lunch menu, and my favorites are the napa cabbage and the dry spicy chicken.  I look forward to coming back again and ordering off of the dinner menu.  It is a small interior with limited seating, so it gets very crowded at peak hours.  The lunch line moves quickly."}
{"text":"I tried the dinner box today. It was 8 $. I had tofu and fish. I personally don't like it. Not so much flavor in it. And it doesn't look appetizing. I'd rather go to Panda Express. Maybe I ordered wrong dishes?"}
{"text":"Ate here a while ago and didn't really like the food. Read the bad reviews. Knew it was not going to be that great. Decided to go again because I wanted to try something different.

Got this Chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible. Fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste. I could make something better at home.

Avoid at all cost. Why go here when there are much better restaurants around.

On another note, apparently they have hotpots there now? Maybe I'll stop by there again just for the hot pot even though I'll probably end up regretting it, again."}
{"text":"$6 lunch you get a big box of authentic chinese food with a pop. Great value and very cheap. Good for both american and chinese and always packed during lunch. Hope they have more space. 

Service is so-so but understandable since they are so busy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING! I've never gotten more value as a college student in my life. This place's value rivals even McDonald's McChickens. Anyways, the lunch special is $5.50 for two entrees and you can add more entrees for $0.50 each. This place was packed with international students when I came for lunch, and that's how you KNOW it's authentic and quality. 

The hot & spicy chicken was definitely good. Their tofu dish was also very good. I got to select from maybe 12 pre-prepared dishes for the lunch special (I think they switch the dishes out daily), and I got to pick a side of either rice or rice noodles. I got rice noodles. The amount they gave me was jaw dropping. A lunch special honestly equals about two meals. If you order only two entrees, they pack in more of the entrees to fill the box, so I think it's a better deal to just get two if you don't mind less variety. I was full to the point of feeling sick after trying to finish an entire meal. 

The lunch special also comes with a free soda or water which makes this place even more so the winner winner chicken dinner. Oh my goodness, how I love Home of Gourmet."}
{"text":"Man, this place is so packed during lunch hours. It can get uncomfortable to dine in with so many people moving through the dining area. If you're looking to sit down and eat, you should take your food and walk across to the first floor of the Psychology building. I gotta say that I'm disappointed that they don't have fried rice. Also, apparently half and half (where you order half rice and half noodles) is not a thing here; you're forced to choose one or the other. In addition, it's only steamed rice and not fried rice. I do like the free water bottles that come with your orders though."}
{"text":"This has been a long time favorite for my friends and I.  We use to be in love with their Orange Chicken, which is still really good! But it just takes extra time for them to make it.  If you don't mind trying new things, you can get a lunch box with rice and two different entrees for pretty cheap. Located right on campus it's perfect place to grab a quick bite to eat in between classes."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by its humble size and decor. There are many Chinese restaurants on campus but this one is by far the best. Its portions are more than generous. I'm not just giving them 5 stars for \"value,\" though; the food here is legitimately so tasty and rich in flavor. They boast versatility in creating authentic Chinese grandma style dishes to Panda Express style dishes. Each dish is distinct too, not like other places around here that use the same sweet and sour sauce on everything. To top it off the service is always friendly, and super generous. Honestly my friends I come here at least once a week, and we're always gonna come back.  We are currently making \" I heart HOG\" shirts. 

This place is serious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the authentic Chinese food I had at lunch here.  The food tasted good and the service was very friendly and helpful.

For the uninitiated, there are basically three menus here.  I think that maybe if they stuck to one menu, they'd get better ratings.

The best menu is their authentic Chinese menu.  This is on the wall to the right as you enter.  It is in both Chinese and in English, but includes almost exclusively authentic Chinese dishes.  The dishes I had were off this menu, were cooked by their Chinese chef, and were excellent - high in flavor, good textures, I'd eat them again anytime.

The second menu is on the left as you come in, and this is mostly Americanized Chinese foods.  I think these may not usually be cooked by their Chinese chef, but instead by their non-Chinese workers.

The third menu is the menu of Thai items. The owner is Chinese, so while I haven't actually ordered from the Thai menu, I wouldn't expect great things from it.

The decor in the place is typical unpretentious Chinese, which is to say plain and frayed at the edges.  Disposable plates and cups don't make much for ambiance, but most inexpensive but authentic Chinese places focus on the food and not the decor.

I deliberated on whether to give them three or four stars, but ultimately I've going with four because I did really enjoy the food I had, and the service was very good.  

Order off the authentic (right-hand) side of the wall, insist you want it cooked authentically, and I think you'll go home happy."}
{"text":"This is my lunch time restaurant 4 people who don't have time to sit or think about nutrition. There is usually an express line of people there for the 11 to 3 lunch special. That I'll buy you two sides and rice or noodles for about 5 to $6. Everything is pretty much pre made and very quick to get. The staff is very friendly. I usually get the orange chicken with rice and bok choy. This was the first time I've ever actually encountered bok choy in the Chinese restaurant and it has made me fall in love. I'm more apt to make them myself these days, but I'll never forget where I first started my love for a good cabbage vegetable. Of course, like most Chinese restaurants it's a little greasy, but for five bucks you can't beat it."}
{"text":"If this restaurant makes food that would be called gourmet, then a prius should be renamed a Lamborghini Diablo.  It was a late night impulse order that I made and as most impulse buys go, it sucked.

Their food tasted really bland, I ordered a vegetarian combo dish and they gave me free egg rolls with pork it. Not that I minded that, but it is just counterproductive when they said they could substitute them with vegetarian ones and did not. Further more, I wasn't given the soda I ordered. 

From the other reviews maybe you can zone into a couple of good dishes. But finding said dishes itself might prove a challenge as it might be lost in the plethora of crap that this place has to offer. CU has a huge offering of Asian restaurants, stay away from this one."}
