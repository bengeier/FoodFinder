{"text":"They are closed. New restaurant is Terrace Cafe and it's amazing. Welcome to the hood."}
{"text":"Never clicked on \"update\" so, along with you I'll find out how this works...  Went back for lunch over Thanksgiving.  The crab bisque was really good.  I'm not one to rave about a simple sandwich but their tuna salad w/bacon, cheddar, on buttered wheat toast was pretty darn great.    Since \"Yelp Stars\" mean different things to different reviewers, here's how I justified the upgrade to 3 stars:  The food is pretty darn good and consistent and deserving of 4 stars.  I just think it's too pricey for where and what it is...a neighborhood restaurant/bar, and that gets them 2 stars.  So overall a 3."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch one time. Food is ok and a bit pricy too. May not go back any time soon..."}
{"text":"I just relocated to Ballantyne from Miami. My roommate took me to this spot my third day here. I loved the food. Reasonably priced for the portions. I had the lobster risotto....it was AMAZING!!!! My friend had a chicken dish, served with bacon risotto. Also very good. The drinks were so so. The service was bad. Our server would disappear for lenghty periods of time. At one point the mgr had to help us out. But none the less it was good....actually headed there for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Mothers Day brunch was a disaster, poor service no food . We waited for over an hour for our order, and when part of it showed up it looked like a child's portion."}
{"text":"Two of my rules for trying a new place:  - Never eat in an empty restaurant  - Never order from a menu with typos.  I violated both of these rules and paid the price.  The food there is nothing special. The chopped salad isn't chopped and is a random combination of flavors that don't go together, including some kind of processed meat substance that seemed to be either chicken or ham. My friend's sandwich was completely lackluster.  Service was totally underwhelming and our server was doused in way too much perfume.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. our food was good.  We shared so we could try 2 different things. Drank water so price wasn't a problem. Other items on the menu were pricey."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Our server was clueless and couldn't tell us what beers they had on tap. Instead of telling (selling) us the special for the night (yes, only 1), he tossed a photocopied sheet of paper on the table with the one and only dinner special listed.   The manager/hostess sat us and then forgot there was a band coming in and had to move us.  The table she moved us to was right in front of where the band was setting up and I spent the majority of my dinner getting knocked and pushed by various pieces of the band's equipment as they moved in.   As the reviewer above noted, the manager seems to be wandering through the dining area - yet never really checks on anything.  Then again, maybe past experience has warned her not to ask the customers how their dining experience is going.  The chopped salad was definitely not chopped and the turkey on it was a grade below oscar meyer - some sort of processed stuff out of a can.  the dressing was oily and tasteless - for $10 - it was a rip off.    All in all, an overpriced, tasteless, disappointment without much atmosphere."}
{"text":"UPDATE JUNE 2011 - NOW CLOSED. Soon to be Terrace Cafe's second location."}
{"text":"Two stars is probably over-generous...I can't believe I spent nearly 20 bucks for a meal that would have tasted much better (and cost less) at Arby's.    Seated quickly but no napkin/silverware. I went and got my own napkin/silverware eventually, AFTER the food arrived.  SLOWWWWWW waitress. I was just about to give up and leave when she finally noticed me.   Not an impressive selection of beers, IMO.   Got the french dip sandwich au jus.  Bread was meh. Meat smelled and tasted slightly \"off\". Bit tough.   Fries were good.   Check slow to arrive.   Didn't feel extremely welcome. The hostess was a bit brusque, perhaps b/c she was having to rush around and do things that the wait staff should do? Not sure. They seemed understaffed.   Really disappointed. Wanted to treat myself to a fun little meal at somewhere cool. Just lost money."}
{"text":"They had some great drink and wine specials here, but unfortunately they are now out of business!  I saw a sign on the door the other day that a new restaurant will be opening sometime this summer."}
{"text":"First time here for brunch and I really enjoyed it- 3.5 stars  I went with a classic Caesar salad wrap with potato salad. The wrap needed a little something more - maybe some tomatoes or red onion...It was definitely mostly lettuce. I ordered a side of dressing and that made it better. Paneras is much better -sadly. The side potato salad was super awesome- it had bacon and chives in it. I find potato salad in the south tends to be too sweet so I was really happy with this variation.   Another person in the group had the chicken salad with chips. Chips looks delicious (homemade) and she was happy with her meal.  I got to try some samplings off the $15 brunch buffet. I liked the biscuits and gravy, eggs benedict, and prime rib. They did not have mashed potatoes as advertised so I was a little sad about that, and I wasn't a huge fan of the goat cheese crepe (I thought it sounded great...). Overall I am not sure if it is quite worth that price tag.  The mimosas were delicious   I'd like to try it again and may try those filet lollipops or ahi salad"}
{"text":"I have never been for dinner but have been many times for lunch as it is close to where I work.  We go here for team lunches, etc. and have no cause for complaints with one exception: the price.  Way too pricey for what it is.  Today I spent 20 dollars on my lunch entree (including tip). That's with just water to drink.  I can say that the food is hit or miss.  My two personal faves are the Lobster Roll and the Shrimp Scampi. The Lobster Roll is as good as you are going to get outside of New England. The Shrimp Scampi is delish.  The salads are so-so, especially the chopped salad which comes in this ridiculous odd-shaped bowl making it hard to eat out of.  I haven't tried them but I hear the paninis are good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It's in a cute area that has a cluster of restaurants surrounding it, as well as a wine bar and dessert restaurant, plus some shops, and a movie theatre. We went on a Saturday night and ate outside, and they had a guy there playing acoustic guitar who was really good. He did covers as well as originals, and he sang a lot of Dave Matthews which I loved.   Okay, back to the restaurant. If you are a seafood lover you HAVE to get the grouper -- it is amazing. It was served over an almond polenta and had grapes in the dish. It was cooked perfectly and was soooooo tasty! They also have a really good hummus, served with pitas and several other delicious spreads.   We've been here several times, sometimes on a Saturday night for a nice dinner and sometimes on a Tuesday for a simple salad and soup, and it's been great every time. My only issue with it was the \"fresh mozzarella\" they add to the salad. Maybe I'm biased being from New York and eating the real mozzarella, but you could definitely skip this. If I hadn't read it on the menu I wouldn't have known what I was eating! Definitely eat here and you won't be disappointed -- and ask for Jason to be your server, he is awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome outside terrace!  The food was decent, not really good, but edible.  I had the crab cake salad, which was not bad, and the sirloin - which was dry and tasteless. yuck! The service was so-so.  The atmosphere was what made it nice really and live music outside!"}
{"text":"The only reason I was here on a Wednesday night was to see a friend of mine play his music.  We were supposed to have a low key evening and catch up on old times, but sadly this did not occur.    Not once, but twice, I was accosted by drunken patrons at the bar.  Both obviously intoxicated beyond normal measure and both attempting to instigate a fight.  In any other bar I've been in Charlotte the security would have swooped in to neutralize the situation.  Not here.  Also, I would have expected the bartenders to have \"cut off\" these individuals a long time ago.  Again, not the case as these miscreants were still drinking after our altercation.  If it weren't for the sober friend in their group this night would have ended on a sour note indeed.  When management finally decided to intervene it was only well after the situation had been diffused on its own.    This is not the kind of crowd I expected in Ballantyne and certainly not the kind of evening I expected at the Village Bistro.  Until they get a better handle on their unruly patrons I would strongly recommend you avoid this place at all costs.  The Fox & Hound is just across the street and I have yet to get into a fight there."}
