{"text":"Smoke's is always a good choice wherever you go for a snack, but when walking around all day, fries and gravy just hit the spot.  This location in the zoo is quite nice as there is indoor seating to eat (with AC), but you do have to order and wait outdoors to get it.  A good amount for the price you pay, just what is to be expected with Smoke's."}
{"text":"Smoke's poutinerie has 2 locations at the Toronto zoo, one outside the Africa restaurant and another in a trailer near the entrance. The food is good and the portions are a good size ( I shared with my wife but a hunger person could eat all). Once I gave my order it was very quick to get the food. The price is reasonable plus if you have a zoo membership you get 10% off. The only inconvenience is that is weather dependent wether they are open or not."}
{"text":"they were closed at 4:30pm on a Saturday...quite possibly one of the busiest days of the week, and you closed at 4:30...im not sure if thats normally when you closed cause i was very upset that the poutine addiction could not be satisfied."}
