{"text":"Nick's was the type of place that was great to go to before the Indians vs Yankees game on the Fourth of July, however, not so much on a deserted Saturday night in downtown Cleveland. It's not so much that I don't feel safe, because I do, but the patrons that came in, after we started out being the only 2, were not the kinds of patrons I would hang out with. Needless to say, on gamedays, this place was bangin. For my namesake, and that of the bar, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Nick's is a place that has potential to be a really cool regular \"How I Met Your Mother\" type hangout, but lacks enthusiasm to achieve it. You'd think drinks would be cheap, but they're not. The bartender made my simple drink wrong. It seems unclean. We didn't stay long, and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in prior to a concert at Progressive Field. Great craft beer selection. But we opted for the advertised $3.50 22oz draft special. Ordered four, total = $10.00. Did this for 3 more rounds.  I'll take it. Friendly staff, good music playing on the jukebox. Perfect pre game/pre concert hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This place has gotten much better.  Paint job, restrooms cleaner, etc.  One of the best beer selections that is right there to choose from and there are a lot of hard to find beers that you won't find anywhere else in the city.  They have a great selection of Liquors (Booze) which includes Remmy Martin that you just can't  find in these bars.  It's also not like a beehive in there. You can go in and relax without people crowding you.  $2 beers during happy hour. An inexpensive place that makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Stopped here and it was the worst bar experience. Order a crown apple and ginger ale. Was told I had to get a double I didn't have a choice. I was stopping after work and still had to drive home I didn't want a double. My friends wanted Long Islands. The owner wouldn't let the bartender or himself to make it for his guest. Therefore we left. If they don't want my business fine they won't ever get it."}
{"text":"Bartender was friendly.  Very diverse crowd.  Great juke box for reasonable price.  I was with a group of friends on our annual baseball stadium trip.  I don't often rank restrooms, but the men's room ranked as one of the worst of ALL time.  We've been joking about it ever since."}
{"text":"Service was good. Atmosphere was to be expected. Do not order the wings. I don't think there is a kitchen here so the wings are frozen I think... Way too much breading and swimming in sauce."}
{"text":"Nice bar, from what I can remember. They have a good selection of Belgium brews by the bottle, again...from what I recall."}
{"text":"Dejected from a sold out Pecha Kucha and hoping I could get back in during the intermission, I decided to wait by making my first visit here. The place only had 2 yelp reviews from years ago and I wondered if it changed. Curiosity got the best of me this time: nothing besides possibly a paint job or a minor remodeling.   It's a typical sports bar. Numerous neon beer signs lined the tops of the walls. I was the only customer there on Friday night, 8pm. Bartender was ok.   The set-up is a long and narrow bar with a few tables on the side. There's 8 taps, mostly domestics with a great lakes and shock top. 4-5 HDTVs hang above the bar, situated for sitting at the bar. There appeared to be a very small kitchen in the back [I didn't see the menu].   4.75 for a bottle of Leinenkugel [an expected price for a downtown sports bar]; had a decent selection of bottled beer, probably 15-20 total, including a few microbrews.   For better or worse, Nick's doesn't stand out from to the rest of the downtown sports bars: caddy shack [across the street from Nick's], Harry Buffalo, Panini's, cleat's, winking lizard, city tap, the Clevelander, all within a 4 block radius of there."}
{"text":"Nick's was the place to go in between the wrestling sessions!!!!! While everyone went towards the crowds, if you went left you found a gem of a place. Nick's was what it was a great place to have a drink or two or three with your pals. The bartenders were quick and on it. They would crack a joke every so often. This place made you feel as if you were in your basement having a party. A great place to catch a game."}
{"text":"I will not be a returning customer to Nicks based only on the atmosphere.    If the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a hangout, it would be this bar.    It's disgusting, and I'm a total fan of dives.  And not Dive Bar on W 6th."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. Walked in here after a tribe game. Customers seemed friendly but the ladies bathroom was so disgusting that I had to use the men's. It equally smelled of piss and there was no toilet seat but at least it didn't have \"Fix me please.\" written on it like in the ladies room. My husband and his friend were disgusted too and they typically aren't pussies. We walked out without getting a drink. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Cheap beer but really not my scene. Really local/divey also if your a cigarette smoker and looking all over downtown for a smoke... they sell them there. Only tip I have"}
{"text":"Typical sports bar which sports bar food. This is a older bar that has numerous flat screen TV's that are above the bar. They have maybe three beers on tap. The crowd was pretty friendly along with the service."}
{"text":"Looking for a dive, like a dive?? Nicks!  It beautifully simple, old, and an excellent drinking bar. They stay open about 30 minutes after their neighboring bars close down so you can grab one more if your not ready for it to be quittin time yet. The service is established, routine, and consistent. The patrons are from all shades of the spectrum but the vibe is ultra chill."}
