{"text":"Solid! Roast pork sandwich with pickled veggies is one of my favourite sandwiches in the area."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident and tried their stewed beef. Solid meal size for the price, occasion appropriate, and delicious. Would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"La cuisine est très savoureuse, j'ai deja gouté le poulet, les saucisses, le boeuf, servis sur du riz avec des lentilles ou des haricots. Tout était délicieux. Les assiettes sont énormes et valent carrément le prix. Je recommande vivement ce stand au marché, surtout aux personnes qui préfèrent attendre dans la longue queue au stand voisin des satay brothers"}
{"text":"Haven't visited the restaurant yet, but love their little joint at the Atwater Market. Had seen an interview on television and had to go visit. Husband and I totally loved the stews of rabbit and the other one with Shrimp. Lovely to see all those big cooking pots, the smell is amazing. Big, tasty comfort food. So happy to have discovered they deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"Les assiettes sont très bonnes, personnel sympathique. Même si l'extérieur ne pousse pas à rentrer n'hésitez plus c'est le rougail est une tuerie"}
{"text":"They make their exotic food at the Marche Atwater.    Slow cooked meats: rabbit, beef, pork and chicken.  All simmering in wonderfully fragrant spices.    2 items for $15.50, we added pork dumplings at $0.90 each.  Soy and sriracha were left on the side per our request.    Lentils and pickled vegetables really made the plate complete. Exceptional food from unknown places, a tiny island off Madagascar, Reunion Island.    Portions are large and priced fairly.  You can easily share a plate between two people.    This food is cooked with genuine care and they truly want to make their diners experience special.  Pleasantly surprised at the availability of this type of cuisine at a market."}
{"text":"Le comptoir de Marmite Su'l Feu est ouvert de mai à octobre au Marché Atwater, dans le côté Nord où se retrouvent toutes les cantines extérieures.   J'adore la diversité et la qualité de la nourriture de ce coin- on peut y siroter une bière et déguster un laksa singapourien, une soupe pho ou une variété de charcuteries. C'est animé! On peut reconnaître ce restaurant par les nombreuses casseroles imposantes en fonte qui s'enlignent devant les clients et par les odeurs parfumées qui émanent de celles-ci. La cuisine de l'île de La Réunion est influencée par ses racines indiennes, chinoises, africaines... Imaginez des viandes tendres enrobées  par une sauce cari accompagnées de rougail, ce à-côté composé de tomates coupés en dés, petits piments et gingembre en quantité industrielle. Pour 13,50$ on a eu droit à un plat de riz, lentilles et viande au choix. J'ai adoré le lapin braisé- si j'avais une grand-mère réunionnaise j'aimerais imaginer qu'elle m'aurait cuisiné ce plat. Et pour les amateurs d'épices il ne faut pas rater leur sauce épicée maison! Hyper relevé et goûteux.   J'aime beaucoup le concept et j'y retourne dès que possible!"}
{"text":"It's safe to say that the cuisine of the tiny island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean is not well represented off of its shores. Stumbling across the stall that the restaurant maintains at the Atwater Market, I was tempted by the array of stews in large Dutch ovens (\"marmites\" in French) and could not resist. I had a combination platter of three meats (duck, rabbit and a pork sausage), served with a helping of rice, small lentil-like beans, a spicy pepper salad and slices of pickled cucumbers and found it all to be delicious if not a bit too much to finish on my own. I washed it down with a wonderful Belgian beer, which I felt suited the dish very well."}
{"text":"Nice lil caché and just few minutes walk from St-Henri metro station... they actually have stands at the Atwater and Jean-Talon markets.  I had their porc dumplings (bouchons) and their coconut cakes (bonbon) and they were delicious.  I plan on trying other items from their menu... cannot wait"}
{"text":"Very rustic and simple place, we went to the restaurant location and also à their stand in Atwater market. The food sleek for itself, very simple, good, and well seasoning. The decor of the restaurant is a bit flat, it's a few red pic-nic tables, a flag of  Reunion Island, some pictures and flip-flop hanging on a string, maybe a make over is to think (you can have a island vibe without a shoe hanging behind you). But I think the big mistake is the front, it's dirty, the paint need a bright new layer, and their signs are hand cut vinyl and tape paper. I put 4/5 because the food is great, the service is fast and nice ever at Atwater market but clearly the restaurant who is open all year long need a make over."}
{"text":"The shumai dumplings from Marmite Su'l Feu were amazing! They also have a dumpling sandwich. The chef is from the French island, Reunion, near Madagascar and he was really nice. Also tried a meat in pastry kind of dish which was really tasty. Try this place!"}
{"text":"I first knew of Marmite Su'l Feu when they opened at Marche St-Jacques. I tried it once, loved it and they closed it. I was quite disappointed. Then I realized they have their original one at marche Atwater! This week my colleague said he wanted something hearty, something flavorful for lunch, and a lightbulb tirned on in my head. So I took him to the St-Jacques joint to get take-out for lunch. We actually went out of our way as we actually need to take the metro to get there XP When you walk on St-Jacques and about a blovk and a half away, you can actually smell the food and it made out mouths water from that far. I took the 3-meat plate, the veggie pickles and a couple of yuca cakes. We had bouchons while we wait and I think my friend had a foodgasm. He said he hasn't tasted something this good in a long time so I had to give him a little privacy with the them.... :P Everything was so good. The more you eat, the more you want it. All the flavors and texture and the contrast between the hearty sauce & meat and he fresh tangy pickles was just too frigging awesome. I definitely recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow...Quelle belle découverte....ce petit resto situé dans le quartier St-Henri à l'écart de la rue Notre-Dame est à adopter!! Au menu, on y retrouve différents choix de caris de viande (poulet, porc, boeuf,++++) ainsi qu'aux poissons et fruits de mer à un prix très correct soit 1 choix pour 13.50$ , 2 choix 16.50$ et ainsi de suite + les accompagnents (riz, lentille et légumes marinés)!!! L'endroit est très petit mais plus que coloré et chaleureux!!! Pour ma première visite, j'ai opté pour le cari poulet × boeuf qui était vraiment tendre et juteux!!! AAA+"}
{"text":"Marmite Su'l Feu serves food from Île de la Réunion which is located on the Indian Ocean, next to Madagascar. The cuisine is characterized by African/Creole flavours with influences from India, China, and France. It is not to be confused with the Cajun/Creole cuisine that originated in Louisiana.   My friend and I ordered 4 curries that day, along with a few appetizers (see photos below).  The curries had the same flavour profile that was uni-dimensional (salty and spiced) and overpowered the flavour of the different meats. Pork, pork roti, beef, and duck all tasted the same; It became a little boring after the first few bites. The texture of the meat was fine: some parts were fall-off-the-bone tender, some tough and chewy.   The curries are served on a plate with fresh cucumbers, spicy tomatoes, and rice. We were told that to mix before eating - I loved the contrast between the freshness of the cucumbers and the heaviness of the spice (on the meat) (3.5/5).    The owner also made us try his homemade hot sauce. It was a pepper paste - not a hot sauce - and it was pretty darn spicy. Best part of the meal!! (5/5)  The appetizers, which consisted of what seems to me, a regional fusion samosa, wonton, and falafel were all pretty good. I liked the samosa best: it had a nice chunk of tender beef wrapped in thin crispy dough (4/5). The wonton tasted average, Chinese wontons taste better (3/5). Falafel was spicy, but dry, I've had better ones (2.5/5).  The owner was super friendly and walked every departing customer to the door. That's cute hahaha."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place - both the Atwater joint and their permanent location (though I've only done delivery from the latter). They stick to their basics and execute them solidly. If you liked slow cooked, somewhat stew- or curry-like comfort dishes, I think you'll be satisfied here. Price is very reasonable. People are extremely nice. One quibble: I'd take a pass on their samosas though - the low point among their options."}
{"text":"What a treat to have in the hood and frankly, I'm a little upset that I didn't visit sooner. Specializing in Ile de la Réunion creole curries and roasts, this places offers radically tasty and unique flavours at totally reasonable prices.  Beyond the food, the space is pretty special- it's the former Satay Bros restaurant and a lot of the kitschy decor remains from it's Asian-fusion predecessor, all overlapped with souvenir-type things from Ile de la Réunion. If you dine in (they have takeout as well), you'll be sitting at colourful picnic tables with mismatching utensils. Totally my cup of tea.  The true gem of this place is the fellas running it- upon entering they happily explain to EVERYONE that they're from IdlR and this is their family/friend-run joint. While we had already ordered, the chef insisted I try the dumplings (because he claimed I absolutely must) and when I asked about their tangy taste he retrieved the citrus-type fruit from the fridge to have me smell it. Wow."}
{"text":"I came to Atwater market and found this amazing place. Incredibly tasty and I saw Chef Christoph cook it fresh from 9:30 to 11 am. Then we got a small plate pork with rice and beans, followed by taste of duck and beef. They are all good but duck is mind blowing. Highly recommended"}
