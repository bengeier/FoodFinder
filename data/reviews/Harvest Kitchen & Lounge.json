{"text":"It's always disheartening when you take a guest to an old favorite restaurant and receive zero respect. I understand that we arrived late (9 PM) to the restaurant, because of a party member that had to work late, but the dirty look we got from the hostess and the waiter rushing us and dismissing our questions, provided for an unfriendly environment. The waiter, whom we had had before, still lacks knowledge of the food and drink menu - so much so that our guest was amazed that he wasn't a brand new employee. He had a blatant apathy towards our dining experience, even though we had apt time to order and enjoy a dinner before the kitchen closed. I wished I had worked late due to the inflated prices, which fit Michael Longo's inflated ego. I appreciate the locally grown food, but, from my experiences, no pasta special that included bacon shavings as the main protein should cost $26. I'm sad that one of my favorite restaurants produced one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while. I have no plan to go back."}
{"text":"I went with a group of eight people.  Fantastic service.  Kobe Beef Sliders were awesome.  I was too full for dessert, but the bread pudding with white chocolate and dried cherries sounded soooo good.  I will definitely return to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"We had wanted to try this restaurant for awhile and we were not  disappointed. I had the Ahi Tuna and my wife had the trout. Both dishes were excellent. We will definitely return to sample some of the other very interesting items on the menu. It is nice to have a choice of a restaurant  that is not one the chain variety!"}
{"text":"We went there a couple of weeks ago and literally had one of the worst meals ever. But it's strange because it was a mixed experience. So here's the situation:  service was pretty good but certainly not great, cocktails are amazing very high quality, salads were delicious.  Then the entrees came and carry late at that. Three of the 4 were inedible. One was ok. The other three were ordered medium rare but all three came even past well done. They must have forgotten those three in the oven but still decided to pull them out and serve them to us. When we told them later there was no apology or recognition that they blew it. Oh well I live nearby but I will never go back. And they aren't bashful about charging for their food."}
{"text":"Everything is way too salty.  I have heard the chef say rude things about customers quite loudly. There is obvious inequality with respect to how customers are treated, they have their obvious favorites. Interesting menu but it doesn't deliver what you read."}
{"text":"A great place if you like things burnt. They burnt the roasted chicken that I ordered. Then they made it again. It was black this time. They never comped me for my meal and the waiter argued with me. I called two days later and the owner did nothing to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"If you live in Northeast Ohio, appreciate fine dining, and have not been to Harvest, then you are missing out.  This place could be dropped into Manhattan and would hold its own. The menu is unique, and is constantly refreshed with dishes you just do not find elsewhere, especially in Solon, Ohio. They generally have three or four new specials every month that would be other restaurants' signature dishes. You just cannot go wrong on the food, which would cost double if the place was located downtown.   As for the ambience and staff, I have always been treated warmly and with the utmost courtesy.  Of course, I am a courteous patron for my own part.   As for the one star type reviews left by some others, all I can suggest is that those are wildly unreasonable and reflect a bias that is about something other the quality of the restaurant.    Any person who wants to enjoy the best food available anywhere will find himself a regular at Harvest - you can't help yourself. If you are looking for something else, well, I don't know what to tell you."}
{"text":"Great food.  Interesting menu.  Nice bar selection.  Excellent service.  Great for an awesome weekday meal with friends."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times.  It's one of my favorite go-to places when I am in town for business.  The service is always prompt and friendly.  I generally go for the short rib, it's delicious and hits my price point.  The bar area  is great to catch a game or the dining area if you're dining with friends."}
{"text":"The food was good.  What we're having trouble with is that we arrived 30 minutes early.  There were 4 tables occupied and 15+ empty tables. I jokingly asked if there was a table available or if we would need to wait at the bar.  We were told that our table wasn't ready and to have a seat at the bar.  We waited 30 minutes and then we're down to a table that had been open the whole time we had been there.   I understand asking us to wait if they were full,  but no one came in and sat at a table while we sat at the bar.   I had the wild boar.  Nicely done. My gf had the seared tuna.  It may have been delivered to the table next to us accidentally, returned to the kitchen, and served to us.   Overall,  we were pleased,  but not overjoyed. BTW, we hate the change from open table to reso. As a consumer I get nothing from reso; I get rewards from open table."}
{"text":"We have dined at Harvest several times and have never been disappointed. Our dinner last night was no exception. The feature salad of Chef's Garden tomatoes with burrata was amazing as were the oysters. Our entrees were even better, Skuna Bay salmon with black rice, romano beans, chives and yellow curry and a perfectly cooked Pat LaFrieda hanger steak with duck fat fries and salsa verde. Harvest is tucked away on a quiet street but it is well worth finding. The service is very good and always friendly. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I often don't complain in this manner, but when arrogance and just plain \"bad form\" manners are displayed especially by the owner - a comment is in order.  My wife and I were at there bar ordering two drinks and appetizers (ready to order dinner) when I asked the very nice bartender to change the TV from sports to another channel in subtitles. He complied happily. After a few minutes, the bartender told me that he was sorry that the owner wanted it changed back to his channel of his choice. The bartender said he was sorry that he had to communicate this to us. Understand-we were the only two people at the bar and the restaurant was almost empty. The owner has a reputation of bad behavior in the past.  Don't care if his food is good or bad-common decency and respect should be a given-not here! We left without saying a word. Never ordered the balance of our dinner. He has lost another customer for ever."}
{"text":"Last night I had one of the most outstanding meals I have ever had. I was there for a business dinner and I don't often write yelp reviews but last nights meal left me inspired. . But before I start on the food review I need to complement the restaurant on its cozy ambiance, the pure professionalism and charm of our waiter and the perfectly mixed martinis!   There was no shortage of uniquely prepared appetizers on the menu as well as the nightly specials of the chef. We started with a duck leg appetizer that left me speechless. I followed this up with a bone in pork chop while my associate had a ribeye. They were cooked to our exact specifications. The expertly designed combination of  flavors never stopped.   We finished with the ice cream sandwich with caramel gelato which was simply decadent.   Needless to say this place is a hidden gem and in my opinion one of the best restaurants outside of downtown. I can't wait to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Given the lack of high end restaurant options in Solon, I have continued to \"begrudgingly\" go to Harvest for Dinner.  Each and every time, I promise that it is my last time.  While the food is average at best....its overpriced menu is only topped by the pompous attitude of management (owner i presume).   Much to my chagrin, we went to Harvest last night for New Years Eve.  We brought a total of 7 families that included 15 adults and about 15 kids (ages from 7 to 14).  We had cleared this ahead of time and were told no problem.  Well....we couldn't have been more unwelcome.  They decided to take the 1 decent tasting item off the menu for the evening  (the hamburger) which also happened to be what we planned for the kids to eat.  They had ZERO interest in helping us find items for the kids.  SO much for working with the customer.  It was not as if the restaurant was filled to capacity and we were about to spend a lot of money....a little customer service would have been nice.    In summary - my new years resolutions is to stay away from this establishment until its under new management....until then...stay away...."}
{"text":"My wife and I have always tried to support local business.  We were so exited when this place opened, per my original review.   I don't know whose fur I rubbed the wrong way, but have been made to feel less and less welcome with each visit to this place.   (This after being several larger parties of family to Harvest.). I thought being an advocate of a business was a good thing.    The other negative feedback posted on yelp by a previous employee, gives deeper meaning to what another Harvest customer told me he overheard the owner not speaking nicely about my family.    While I love the food, and the staff has always been pleasant. I may have difficulty going back there and truly enjoying the experience.        You make the call."}
{"text":"I lived in Solon for many years, and always wished there were a progressive casual/fine dining restaurant to eat at.  I live in Lyndhurst now, but will be making the trek to Solon often to eat at Harvest!  Went to the opening party and sampled Hangar Steak with creamed spinach and salsa verde, fresh Pacific Oysters, HUGE shrimp cocktail, Lamb Meatballs, Kobe Beef burgers, Duck Confit with Goat Cheese(yum!), crispy chicken livers with cheesy grits, Duck Fat Fries that were out of this world!  And my favorite thing was Fettuccine Carbonara with pancetta and a perfectly poached egg on top!  The sauce was the best I've ever had!  Do yourself and your taste buds a favor & try this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Harvest Kitchen and Lounge over the summer and had a great experience. I recommended it to friends and business collegues to to it's good food and local buying. We visited once again last week and had a horrible exericence. There was more than one thing wrong which I was willing to overlook but when we asked the server it was clear they were not into customer service.   We ordered the burger, which was alright. The bun was very stale and neither of us finished our \"half\" of the burger.  We told the server our bun was stale thinking the kitchen would sub the bun or offer us another dish. The exact words we got in response to our query were, \"that is just how the buns we use are.\" Stale buns?  That should be easy to fix.   We were not even offered another type of bread. Things went down hill from there. The wine I wanted was sold out, clearly we decided not get get dessert. Our bill was $55 for a burger to share and wine that was not my first choice.   I called the next day to complain and was told that they would send me a gift card so I could come in again.   Guess what - no gift card came. I don't beleive they are into customer service and I won't be recommending the place anymore."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite spot in Solon! We come about once every two weeks and always have a wonderful time. It's hard to find great food in Solon but Harvest blows us away every time! Pork chop is the best I've had in years. Their special Rico Pallota pasta is to die for too. Get the mussels or crab toast for appetizer. Don't forget bread pudding for dessert! They are famous for their bread pudding. Great service and friendly bartenders as well for the nights we want to sit at the bar. Thanks Harvest!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chill and elegant evening out with some of the best food you've ever had and a great glass of wine, this is the place for you. Just be ready to  spend a little extra. Totally worth it though."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday and I can't say enough about it - it's one of my favorite places here in town. The whole aesthetic is just perfect and beautiful. Love the aesthetic and all of it.  As for the food..... amazing. We had some crab toasts and poutine and I could have eaten 10 Orders as we loved them so much. My favorite thing to order is the short rib and three of us had this. It was delicious and actually, perfect. My one som had the flank steak and the other had the strip- all perfect. On other occasions, we had the burger and fish specials and even the pork chop. All were exceptional.  Longo is a master chef and he is so skilled in bringing farm to table and using locally sourced items for his menu. It's just so good here and I can't even convey this in a post. Is it expensive? I don't believe so as it's one of those meals that you leave and know the money was well Spent. The portions are ample and we all had Leftovers. Just go."}
{"text":"I went to Harvest Kitchen as part of a work dinner when a few of us started at Swirl Wine Bar and moved to this restaurant for dinner.   The place is fairly small and as many folks have said I don't think ambiance is a big thing for them, fortunately, it isn't huge for me either so that is certainly not a deal breaker.  The server was great, he was very knowledgeable of the menu and rattled off a pretty long list of specials, I was fairly impressed with the pure volume of different dishes available that weren't on the menu.   What really impressed me was the consideration put into letting people know what was available for them if they are a vegetarian or even vegan.  I am a pretty strict vegetarian although I will eat some eggs or dairy if I have too occasionally.  They had a few totally vegan options which I took advantage of - vegan ravioli which was delicious.   The folks I was with all ordered things that looked fabulous and no one had any complaints with the food.  Overall, this is a very solid place although a bit on the expensive side, so just be aware of that.   I would not hesitate for a second to go here again and I definitely recommend then based on the experience I had there."}
{"text":"Had the surf and turf- very good special, steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was on the very good side of different. Wedge salad was as expected, creamy blue cheese dressing was flavorful."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the shrimp and grits appetizer!  Save room for dessert, the bread pudding was absolutely amazing!  Great service as well.  We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"The Kentucky Bourbon  Barrel Ale is my favorite drink here.  The dishes are always fresh and delish!  The Bread cheese appetizer was much more than I expected.  I had the Halibut  main course and I would have it again tonight if I was dinning there.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was excellent.  Parmesan crusted flounder with grits was seasoned and sauced perfectly.  Will return because there are so many fabulous choices.  Wish the delicious bread was warmed to crisp the crust instead it is tough."}
{"text":"Date night with my wife. The wonderful smells as you enter make you hungry. The food itself was excellent - amazing flavor! Service and ambiance was good. Would definitely return"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have wanted to try this place for awhile, menu is one of the best I've seen offered around this area for sure. Anyways, I digress...  We were created pleasantly and shown to a table by the owner, who I might add was welcoming and very funny, not at all what has been posted in some other reviews. Anyways, we started with the duck flatbread which was all kinds of awesome, full of flavor and prepared perfectly. My girlfriend who doesn't like duck even enjoyed it!  On the entrees, I got the Kobe beef steak special with lobster ravioli and my girl got the wild boar tenderloin. I have to say both melted in our mouths, seasoned perfectly and were just outrageously delicious. Our favorite spot for gamey meats has always been gamekeepers tavern, but crown the new king!  Also a lot of people have been complaining about the oversatliness here, I honestly have to say everything we are was spot on and seasoned perfectly for me at least.  Just a thought, if you are worried about this, you can always ask for light seasoning and then add it yourself if desired"}
{"text":"I have been here a total of 4 times. The first time was really good (maybe 2 years ago?) and each consecutive time has gotten progressively worse.  This last time, the only redeeming food item i received was the creamed corn.  The salmon i ordered was horrible, im pretty sure it was previously frozen and really tough to eat.  The pork my friend ordered was raw in the middle and the seasoning was flavorless.  This place is really going downhill, its kind of sad because solon needs a restaurant like this, they just need a restaurant that can stay consistently good."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little spot. The wine list is limited, but they have some great wines available at a decent price. We had a bottle of Migration Pinot (from Duckhorn). The Poutine almost filled me before the main course. My only complaint on the poutine was that it was very salty, but with the richness of cheese and duck confit I still ate it all. I had the Blackened Trout for the main course; it was a little overcooked, but not to the serious detriment of the fish. The roasted tomatoes were sweet and well paired with the salt of the generous amount of bacon included in the dish. My major complain was that the waiter seemed to be preoccupied with a large party of older customers to the point that he only asked once about the main course and we waited ~15 min (after finished eating and the wine was out) before he came to ask about the dessert menu and then we needed to flag him down to pay at the end of the night. With a little better service, this would be a 5 star experience in my opinion (for the Cleveland area)"}
{"text":"I was surprised with the ambiance of the restaurant, it was not what I was expecting and I was pleasantly surprised. There was a little wait so we ordered a few drinks, total came to $25 for the round of vodka on the rocks and a glass of wine! And that starts my only main complaint with Harvest; the drinks are expensive for the items that should be the cheapest. I ordered a vodka on the rocks which came to me as a triple ($11) and a glass of Pinot Grigio ($10) which looked like it was poured for a flight tasting! The food wasn't that bad...not for the prices they are charging but it wasn't bad! The beet salad should have been called a salad with a few beets. And the bone morrow wasn't bad but needed to be broiled more. The steak was done perfectly but the grits it was sitting on wasn't creamy and it was lumpy! That being said it is still a step of from the chain \"restaurants\" of Solon. Good place for a night to be seen and for descent food when you want to overspend. Keep up the good work The Harvest!

{"text":"First, the service was great but that is where the positives ended.   The appetizers were the best part of the meal - tomato soup and the house salad. Tomato soup was rich and creamy. Perfect for a cold evening.    I ordered the scallops special and the scallops were very chewy and the sauce was over powered with salt. The butternut squash ravioli that accompanied the scallops were very bland.  The other person a our table ordered the short rib.  Again, the meat was highly over seasoned.    We ordered the  raspberry cheesecake for dessert and it was hands down one of the worst desserts I have ever ordered. It felt like the cheesecake was store bought from two months ago. Zero flavor and an odd texture.   I would go back to harvest just for an after dinner drink or happy hour because the service was wonderful, but not for the food."}
{"text":"The big positive of Harvest is the quality of food that they bring to this area. Solon is crammed with chain restaurants, and the option for a nice evening and nice meal are hard to come by.    My husband ordered a salmon special, which was good, but not terribly memorable.  I ordered the pork chops, which were very good, and I would order them again.  I had to order them well done since I am currently pregnant, and the waiter seemed to have a hard time wrapping his head around that concept. We had the bread pudding for dessert.  I am not a bread pudding fan, but this was awesome! Definitely the highlight of the meal.    The reason I can't give Harvest 5 stars is the price.  For what we paid, I was expecting a dining experience more along the lines of Lola, Dante, or Crop.  I understand that they use a high level of quality ingredients, but I just didn't walk out of there thinking \"I have to come back!\"   Once I am able to drink (they have a great beer and wine selection), I would be more likely to stop in and sit at the bar for a drink and app/salad, than I would a full meal.  The food is very good, the price is just a bit of a deterrent."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely horrible experience. My friend has a severe allergy to mushrooms so we asked the waiter to be accommodating and ensure nothing touches her food. He said he could not do that and sent out the chef. The chef then said no I can't make your food with a separate pot and knife and smirked and walked away. We left considering they couldn't accommodate in any way. They had horrible service and a horrible attitude toward allergies. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"So, my 6th time at Harvest tonight.  I love the menu at this place. I am a foodie and the flavors are rich.  I am disappointed to write this review.  Not sure what happened tonight but food was average and service was awful.  My food was cold and they lost money because the waiter never asked if we wanted more drinks.  The struggle was real and constant.   Also, time for an update.  The toilets have a cardboard tops instead of porcelain.  WTF.    Dear Chef, they are not executing your vision.  Dear Owner, spend some money on an update or you'll be closing soon."}
{"text":"Second time here, and as happy as the first time! Food is delicious and the service is even better. The two waitresses that my husband and I have had, have been very knowledgeable but unpretentious.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of food that you get and they can accommodate vegetarian/vegan/gluten free dietary requests with no issues.  If I had a complaint it would be that the food has a tendency to be in the salty side. I love salt, so I'm not complaining, but if you are salt sensitive or hypertensive, take care ;)"}
{"text":"I'm from Portland, OR, and finding a really great grass fed burger is no problem. Now visiting Warren, OH, for a few weeks, locating a good grass fed burger is not so easy. So I search best GF burger on \"Yelp\" and find quite a few nearer to Cleveland.   I found the Harvest Kitchen with a grass fed Kobe Wagyu burger (sounds YUM) with applewood smoked applewood bacon, roasted tomatoes, provolone and garlic aioli. Took my brother and sister-in-law there. A 40 mile drive through Amish country, no problem, I was hankering for a good burger. We all went for the Wagyu burger and loved the taste, juicy and cooked just right. I would have preferred a moister bun (like a potato bun) as it was a little dry. The baked potato served could have been cooked a bit longer. A few tweaks than this is a 4 star review instead of three stars. I was dying to have the hand cut fries cooked in duck fat but the fryer was out of service. Lots of microbrews on tap and by bottle or a bottle of wine. This place feels like Portland!  Great ambiance and service too. I would love to try some more things on the menu, such as a grass fed steak, wild boar, alaskan halibut, Ohio trout, and more. I think this place is a close to the gastropubs and fine restaurants that I am spoiled by in Portland. This place could easily make a 4 star or 5 star \"Yelpin\" meal because I like it local, farm fresh, scratch and organic--worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My family and I had reservations at Harvest for Mother's Day to celebrate my mother and sister-in-law. My mother and I were on time and by the time we were seated it was approx. 3:05, my brother and sister-in-law arrived at 3:15 (if you ask me, that's a win when dealing with a 7 month old and your first child). When the host sat my brother, he noted \"we have a reservation at this table at 4:45, so you'll need to be done by then\". The four of us looked at each other in confusion, and asked him why he bothered saying that, and informed us because it's our fault we're late. He repeated it a few more times, as we stared in disbelief. Immediately, we knew we didn't feel welcomed there and walked out that very minute. Nobody bothered to stop us and ask what's wrong or why are you leaving.  My uncles have all been in the restaurant industry for 30-40 years and would never tell a customer they have a time limit. The lack of courtesy and complete oblivion to basic manners, changed our appetite. Please note, we would have had an hour and a half and I can almost guarantee we would have been done well before 4:45, also the restaurant was 3/4 empty. Sometimes saying less is better. Thanks to Burntwood Tavern in Solon for their great hospitality and saving Mother's Day, and thanks to Harvest for giving us one less option to consider."}
{"text":"My friend and I  visited this restaurant at the recommendation of the owner's wife for whom my friend had done some work for. We started at the bar with a couple of well shaken martini's. So far so good...Then we were seated and proceeded to order a couple of appetizers. The chef had promised my friend that he would prepare a fois gras appetizer for us.  He was true to his word and it was delicious however there was literally two bites and it was quite pricey...My friends tuna appetizer was delicious but sliced too thin and quite pricey for the portion. I ordered a rib-eye that was extremely fatty and the texture was quite disappointing (not a fan of gristle!) My friend had a seafood and linguine dish that he was very pleased with. We had to ask for bread to be delivered to the table, and you would have thought that the butter was a specialty item...very scant amount....  The service was quite slow and she seemed bothered to wait on us.  I did not send the steak back because I did not want to embarrass my friend. In all honestly, we were expecting a much better dining experience considering the cost of the meal. We had early reservations, yet we waited a while for our dishes to be delivered, There were only a couple of other  patrons seated at the time. It was both our opinions that we would scratch this one off our list of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Disappointed and sad.  Why advertise farm to table and yet not explain anything about your culture and principles.  We had a business dinner for 10 people.  Wait staff was not invested in our experience and certainly did nothing to make us return.  The $46 ribeye was one of the toughest pieces of meat I've had.   Maybe we were eating retired and repurposed milk cows?  Salty and over seasoned, I would swear the steaks were tenderized with papain.  Most folks didn't finish their plates.  Cleveland has a great food scene...unfortunately this place isn't part of it."}
{"text":"Great food, quality ingredients, well seasoned, cooked properly. Sat at the bar, bartender was very good, friendly.  Steak was fantastic as was the short rib.Owner/chef (Bando is last name I believe) was there and on top of everything. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but on par with the prices.   I've heard good things, but tonight was my first visit.  The Grilled Italian Spiced Bread Cheese appetizer was excellent, reminiscent of a tapenade/bruschetta spread on a bed of caramelized cheese.  I had the togarashi crusted ahi tuna special that was served with broccolini and farro (?) in a curry broth. The curry broth was rich, nutty, and had a little kick to it. The tuna itself was cooked perfectly. The broccolini was cooked enough to become tender but was still crisp - perfect. It was an amazing dish, and I'm pretty sure anything resting in that curry broth would be wonderful.  I also had the dark chocolate mousse which was rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Others I was with ordered short rib and rainbow trout and enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. My husband and I tried for the first time yesterday. I had the baby kale salad to start and the blackened Lake Erie Walleye main course, my husband had the poutine and cassoulet. We enjoyed everything. Great ingredients and this translates to great flavors (also translates to the price point, all though not at all out of line with a sit down restaurant). House Cab was great and of course as was the Great Lakes Christmas Ale on tap. Server was both pleasant and helpful. We will return."}
{"text":"Harvest Kitchen is a new american restaurant boasting creative cuisine such as what one would find in downtown. Except, it is at the heart of Solon, voted one of America's top 10 suburbs. With this restaurant alone, I think Solon now is in the top 5.  I do not get the mixed reviews, perhaps the price point? You can make this at home? Don't kid yourself. Let's just start with grass-fed beef -- with a more intense beefy taste and iron-y tone to it. I had the walleye on a bed of lobster ravioli, which was not only inventive, but tasty. One of us had tender beef rib that one could part with a fork, then melt in your mouth.  I loved the environment and modern loft feel to the place. The ambience was busy and energetic. On several trips here, we were seated quick and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food that is healthy and made in a way no other restaurant in Cleveland does. Easily one of the best spots to eat well prepared food."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at this new restaurant and found the decor to be quite pleasant, open and airy with a nice patfor io. The service was very attentive and the food was over all good except to two flaws. We ordered the tuna sashimi appetizer. The slices were wafer thin and few in number and the price was not justified. I had the cobi burger and ordered it cooked medium but instead it was way overcooked and had no flavor not what cobi beef should be. The bloody mary's were great. They need to improve on their appetizers and do a better job at cooking their burgers but overall I would probably try it again."}
{"text":"While the food was tasty, it is almost impossible to rate a restaurant highly when you choose to dine at the establishment on a Saturday night at 7:15 pm and the restaurant is already out of many of the specials and staple menu items! To add insult to injury, they also do not have one of the basic deserts on the menu (brownie). Then, when you choose a different dessert and the waiter comes back and tells us that only one of us can have our chosen dessert because the kitchen only has one of that option left! When we share our disappointment with our server, his response is that it's Saturday night. With the innumerable amount of fabulous restaurants in the area, you would think it would be good business sense for the restaurant to make sure they have enough food to feed hungry patrons on a Saturday night. Otherwise they will choose other establishments."}
{"text":"called to make reservations and the male on the phone seemed rude but made them anyways, then decided to read reviews (not many nice ones, and decided to go somewhere else. At least I thought I would be thoughtful and call to cancel and the dude hung up on me...How Rude!!!"}
{"text":"Please don't go here.  My wife and I and another couple went to this restaurant we had I hopes for a nice evening dinner we arrived and we waited an extra hour and 45 minutes to be seated WITH RESERVATIONS.  They have 2 high school aged girls in jeans covering the front.  We had to ask 2 times for water with our drinks.  There were 3-4 other tables around us looking around and wondering what the hell is going on. After we ordered the appetizers came out and my friends wife's appetizer didn't come out for another 10 minutes after ours became cold, the fois gras was a joke, the $15 salad 5 stems of romaine, and squash just ok.  They completely overbooked the place seemingly to make a profit or poor management and the waitresses and the staff was desperately trying to compensate for awful management resorting to sharing their disappointment and uncomfortable jokes.  I ordered the boar and it was completely overdone.  My friend ordered THE SAME it was bloody red. HOW does this happen?!  He didn't eat it, boxed it up and brought it home for his dogs.  The short rib was good but our mood was so forlorn that it didn't really Matter at this point.  It ruined our night and we only get together every couple of months. Listen, we go out to the top restaurants in Cleveland at least a couple times a month. You can have your choice of any of them with better food, service, experience.  Don't go here, stick to Tremont, W.25, little Italy, the places with much better reputation, it's a waste of money..."}
{"text":"It seemed like most of the other tables in the restaurant were receiving excellent attention, but for whatever reason, our server seemed distracted. It took more than 10 minutes after being seated to receive waters and another 5 minutes for our server to return to take our drink order. Our server didn't bring out complimentary bread with our salads, and brought it out after our entrees only when we requested it, and she made a joke that she didn't want us to spoil our appetites.   Like many other reviewers, I had the misfortune of ordered an overly salty dish. My dining companions all seemed to really enjoy their meals (Roasted Maple Brined Half Chicken, Seared Hawaiian \"Ahi Tuna #1\", and the Venison special). I opted for a squid ink linguine with shrimp, oven roasted tomatoes, spinach and a butter sauce. It was so salty that I couldn't eat more than a few bites. I had to pace myself since the salt was so overwhelming to my palate. I was also disappointed that the kitchen used bay shrimp rather than a larger, more flavorful variety.  The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated and the menu had a lot of potential if you know what to order. I don't think I'll take another chance on a restaurant this pricey. If I'm spending $25+ for an entree, I would rather go for a sure thing."}
{"text":"It does not even deserve one star. The owner thinks you should kiss his feet as you enter his establishment. He did not have half the menu available and what he had was overpriced over salted garbage. I will never go to this Restraunt again. I have never given a one star to a Restraunt this gets a negative one star. Don't waste your money or your time."}
{"text":"I debated between 3.5 and 4 stars.  I go with 4 since my salad was perfect!  Well I have been to the liquor here in the past and did not notice this little gem.  So if you want to buy some hooch and get some good food to  boot then the location is great.    The place is  upscale and classy in a relaxed sort of way.  The servers were super friendly.  I was saddened that they were out of the lamb meatballs.  I met someone at the last minute for lunch.   They ordered the pork chop. It was overcooked but  good. I like my pork with a slightly pink color with extra trichinosis. The reduction sauce was nice, not over powering.  The polenta was nice and creamy. My friend gnawed on the bone,which is a plus in my book!  My steak salad was very good. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare.  It came sliced on the salad.  I think it was a sirloin or flat iron. I could not tell for sure. If I had to bet it would be flat iron!  I asked the sever and she said it was from the shoulder. Well I was not going to press the issues since it tasted great.  The salad came tossed in a light  garlic vinaigrette which was perfect for my salad! It was supposed to be in a creamy garlic dressing but it was not creamy in the way I imagined."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to Applebee's down the street for better food and customer service.  I had the worst dining experience here and told management after our meal.  I was told to call back a week later when the owner was there...talked to the owner a week later who was reluctant to do anything and finally agreed to send us a gift certificate in the mail, guess what has not showed up two weeks later."}
{"text":"We paid a small fortune for dinner for 3 and left hungry . Our son wanted to go get a pizza! Appetizer was 14.oo for 2 periogies as an appetizer. Mine was not even a whole piece of fish for 26 and literally 1 tablespoon of risotto. Ridiculous and will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a dud with lots of potential.      Service: lackluster.    Ambience: confusing and could use some alignment with the concept.  My drink: Manhattan was strong, which is how I like them, so it gets a nod here.   Quality of Food: I had the walleye.  Good for the area although I suspect If another restaurant like this comes around this place is toast.    Price: No way. Too high.    Come back? Nnnnnope.  So why a 3 and not a 2?  Probably because the Manhattan was strong and there's potential to be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Harvest between five and ten times now and the experience had always been excellent. Food, service and atmosphere are all very nice. This is the only place in Solon and the surrounding area that  serves up the type of fare you would find in Tremont or Ohio City.  It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Solon, Ohio. The epicenter of chain restaurants no more. On a solo mission out to prove that good food CAN be had near a cul-de-sac, Harvest Kitchen & Lounge makes a strong case.   On the corner of SOM Center and Bainbridge Road, the meal I had at Harvest was unlike most suburban meals I've come to know. Warm, inviting, inspiring, unique, risky, seasonal, local and expertly prepared. If Harvest was in downtown or Tremont, foodies would be bombarding this place with their discriminating appetites on a nightly basis. Bloggers would've been waxing poetic of their every bite and food photographs would've long ago dominated a Google image search of Harvest. Yet, besides a handful of local Yelpers, word has yet to get out to the masses that Harvest-- way out in Solon-- is not only worth the drive, but certainly able to stand up to the big boys in the city.   In trying to come up with a comparison, Harvest is everything the old Crop Bistro on West 6th used to be. A warm space with an intimate dining room boasting farm-to-table dishes. Can's of pickled veg and fruit are used as accents and reminders that the menu is inspired by seasonally fresh ingredients when possible.   We came in January when practically nothing is in season and we found a whole lot to like. Roasted marrow bones were had as an appetizer. Meat butter and crusty bread. You certainly won't find this at the nearby Applefleas or Max and Erma's. For main course, I had the house special of the night, a plate of pork multiple ways: belly, shoulder, and bacon accommodating the seasonally fresh Brussels sprouts. Expertly seasoned and flawless in taste. I knew instantly this place was special. Other meals consumed at the table included a Polenta Cake with wild mushrooms, spicy escarole and Mackenzie Creamery truffled goat cheese. Also had was a slow cooked shortrib entree with a fingerling potato cipollini onion hash, roasted butternut squash with a balsamic roasted garlic jus. Satisfaction was the unmistakable description on each of our faces following the meal.   Whether or not Harvest survives in an area dominated by boring sameness is to be determined. But a place like this should no longer be a secret. Travel if you must, wherever in NE Ohio you reside. There's something special going on in the kitchen of Harvest. And it needs your support to survive."}
{"text":"Someone thinks they are too big for their britches! When you walk in for dinner with 4 adults and a toddler and the hostess proceeds to tell you they don't have high chairs. Really???! This is Solon, Ohio people, not NYC!!! We are visiting family from Charlotte, so needless to say we won't return or recommend this restaurant. If you're that \"classy\" of a restaurant how about taking down the print outs on your door that tells you what's on tap from your bar. Little confusing as what kind of establishment you're all promoting."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when I journeyed to Harvest.   As far as ambience, I'm not sure their end game, but I'm also not sure it matters. The interior is very plain with modern light fixtures, the Black Keys are blaring, and then there's a long table down the middle of the restaurant with statues of pigs and farm related things. Why not!  But, I have to give credit to their menu. My Moscow Mule was perfectly mixed. The Pork Shank at Harvest is to DIE FOR. Like, Tom Cruise jumping on the couch to die for. The portion was so generous it was unreal, and the red curry broth and black forbidden rice totally worked. The next day, I was craving it like WHOA, and still am.  Foodie approved aside, when I entered, I had a weird stare down with the host. Not sure how long I would've stood there until I said I was here for a reservation for two. That started things off awkward, but the legit menu redeemed it all. I imagine all foodies will adore the interesting and diverse menu.  I think this might be one of the best restaurants in Solon."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Our service was subpar to say the least. The food was okay. I order ribs with fries and risotto. Risotto was way over undercooked but had good flavor. Ribs weren't tender. Fries soggy. Never received bread at our table. Took forever to get wine and the always seemed to be out of what we wanted. I would not go back and spend the amount of money we did for an okay meal. Was expecting to be a lot better but it was not. Disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Our supper club dined here last evening and the food and service was outstanding.  We shared almost the entire appetizer menu and everything was unbelievable.  Usually you can count on the signature dishes being good but this was great across the board.  The owner/chef even sent us home with a pint of his BBQ sauce as a take away.  Make the trip here it is well worth it.   Ray T"}
{"text":"Dined here twice. First visit was in July and nice enough that I wanted to return. Second visit was in November and underwhelming. Dining room was too dark and our food sat under the kitchen warming lights too long."}
{"text":"Good food at moderately high prices.  Service is excellent but the own/chef believes that \"the customer is always wrong\" and refuses to make any but minimal changes in his \"flawless\" cooking.  The place is not as crowded as it could be with a chef without an \"attitude.\"  He also ran Market Square Bistro in Geauga county.  It is now closed.  Why am I not surprised?"}
{"text":"Enter Harvest, a den Macbeth might eat in with its dark, dark walls, spare lights, whiskey, oak, red wine goblets, its bartender with a suitably smoky voice/black turtleneck, and a merry jangle of necklaces including a cross, and crusty bread in a basket served sans adornment, and oh yeah--zip bang songs of a mad modern era blasting loudly, crisply, ceaselessly from somewhere as overhead a basketball game is well underway, and everyone (in the older crowd) laughs and chows right through the supremely rich butternut squash ravioli swimming in pesto and goat cheese and roasted tomato showstoppers, faces all lit harlequin in the macabre red glow from the cylinder lights and here come the drinks--oh baby--all absinthe heavy and chilled in tall glasses, along with Platform flights that are just a touch on the too foamy side, and but wait have you tried the bread pudding which is the pinnacle of foodie desserts, patrons were told the other evening, watching the flicker flames dance on the giant stove in the open kitchen, and watching the wink of stray jumper lights in the sign above the bottles redundantly reading BAR, and feeling cozy here, entombed in a good way. Feeling intoxicated. Nourished. Something wicked this way munches, wherever it's come from; fiends for farm to table should feel right at home in the slick gloom."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant, and a friend drove past it by chance and suggested it for dinner. I was more than pleasantly surprised. We started with a myriad of appetizers, including oysters (very fresh), lamb lollipops (great seasoning with 3 sauces), pork belly (perfectly cooked), stuffed hot peppers (simple but tasty), and crab toast (my least favorite but still good). The best part for me was my entree: the seared ahi tuna with forbidden rice and an amazing red curry sauce. The tuna was cooked perfectly, and the sauce had the optimal amount of heat. I cannot say enough about this dish! Needless to say I'll be back soon. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you are in Solon, this is my top choice of go-to restaurant.  Nice dining scene, enjoyable patio in the summer, delicious food with a natural or unique ingredient spin.  Definitely a higher price point here so be prepared for an expensive night out."}
{"text":"Wonderful indie resto atmosphere.Menu promises eclectic fresh food but doesn't deliver on several counts. Oysters flooded with sauce--please let us out our own on. Mushroom soup rich with mushroom flavor but salt overshadowed it. Grits and shrimp app a salt fest bathing in oil. But is has food ingredients--chef just doesn't seem to know to allow ingredients to stand alone. My friend's ravioli was dried out around the edges. Love the menu--love the vision--let the ingredients do their thing and leave the salt shaker alone.  Plus the server seemed to have something better to do than help us.  Two of the oysters (out of a dozen) were rancid and we told him but he didn't seem to care - certainly didn't take anything off of the bill - which BTW - was $130 for one entree, two apps, 3 beers and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for you my beloved Harvest?!?! I'm a well-traveled, well-fed Texan with a great love of all things \"farm-to-table\". This place is a gem. It's got character and charm and the food is amazing. Duck fries, marrow bones, Kobe burger w/ an egg, glass of their recommended red wine (I went Bonny Dune) and it's a perfect foodie night. When dining alone, I sit at the bar and the bartender is great company. I'm here as often as I can be when in town for work."}
{"text":"In Solon on business and desperate for good food, I had the good fortune to stumble upon \"Harvest Kitchen and Lounge\".  I went back the next night.  And if I hadn't flown out the next morning I'd have been back again.    On a busy stretch of road lined with muffler shops and fast food franchises (read \"food like substance\") it would be easy to miss Harvest Kitchen.  (I did and doubled back.)  You park out back and enter through the rear (that's where the hostess is).  The high ceilinged dining room is decorated in soothing colors.  Very airy, very well lit, and not over-chilled - no sweater needed.  It's a handsomely appointed establishment  Harvest Kitchen has fish, foul and red meat; pasta and vegetarian selections, a long list of enticing appetizers and a above average wine list.  I would say the menu's organizing principle is something like \"north Ohio locavore\".  They collect as many ingredients locally as possible, they even found an Ohio made pasta.  It shows in the taste.  I had the saffron angel hair pasta with shrimp, chorizo and vegetables the first night; the tomatoes, spinach and shallots really dressed it up.  The ginger shrimp and sesame noodles (with peas, tomatoes, basic and curry) was equally enticing.    Harvest Kitchen and Lounge is Hands down the best restaurant in Solon Ohio.  That's not saying much, but Harvest Kitchen would generate positive notice anywhere - in Solon (an unexceptional, distinction free suburb southeast of Cleveland) it's a real stand-out.  Next time I'm in Solon I'll eat there every night - no point in looking further afield.    Harvest Kitchen would rate at least four stars in any urban center.  But it a distant suburb like Solon it's five stars for sure."}
{"text":"The Harvest Kitchen has an interesting menu that was well executed. Our server was attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable. We had a great time."}
{"text":"I go here regularly with colleagues for dinner. Always attentive and friendly service and reliably good food. It's my go-to when colleagues are in from out of town."}
{"text":"I read an article about this restaurant in the paper and my fiancée and I decided to give it a try.  Overall we were very impressed, except for one detail.  They got our reservation wrong.  I called for eight and, although the gentleman on the phone confirmed that he would be seeing us at eight, someone wrote down eight thirty.  Not really the end of the world or anything, but it didn't start the night off on a good note because we ended up cutting it close for some plans we had after dinner.  Nonetheless, once we were finally seated, our meal was incredible.  The kobe beef sliders surf and turf appetizer was unbelievable and really blew us away.  We also got the duck fat fries, which were good, but not really as much different from regular french fries as we were anticipating.  Our entrees were delicious, professionally prepared and well presented.  I had the carbonara and my fiancée had lobster ravioli.  The portions were also well sized. For desert we finished off with the cheesecake and the bread pudding, which both were very good but extremely rich.  The bill was also pretty reasonable for this quality of food and the overall dining experience.  We were really quite impressed with Harvest Kitchen and I would have given the restaurant 5 stars, had it not been for screwing up our reservation, which was unprofessional in my opinion."}
{"text":"Pros: yummy cocktails and the kale salad was ON POINT, diverse & creative menu, hanger steak was cooked perfectly  Cons: server was mumbly, cocktails took forever to make, we sat there for perhaps thirty minutes before we could even order an appetizer, and \"duck fat roasted fingerling potatoes\" apparently means \"cold, greasy fries\".   After we'd had our salads and appetizers, we were all chatting and I looked at the time...it was 90 minutes past the time we had sat down! Still no entrees, no explanation for the lateness. Our server then began bringing our plates over...all except my friend's. She encouraged us all to start eating, but after almost ten minutes after the first plate was brought out, another friend had to leave the table to go track down her food! The server did take that off the bill, which was nice.   For seven people, our bill was $400, minus my friend's fish. You'd think with the amounts they charge, they could afford a couple more light fixtures..."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Tuna was great.  Brussels Sprouts were very blah. Service was great. Beer selection was good, though they didn't have the 1st three (3!) beers my wife asked for. But for $100 out the door for two entrees, two beers, and one app, pretty good isn't very good."}
{"text":"Over-promise and under-deliver.  There's so much to like about Harvest.  It's close, it's upscale, and it's diverse.  You want to go in and like it all, and drink some craft beer or win, smash some delicious food, and call it a night.  Well, what you get is some decent house wine prices, some ever-shrinking appetizers, and decent entrees for top dollar.  The problem here is that it's just alright and nothing terribly excellent and nothing terribly bad.  We went months ago for drinks and apps, and the bartender was friendly and we enjoyed some crab toast.  This time, the crab toast portion is halved but the price isn't quite proportional.  The one piece was also quite smaller.  The Hawaiian tuna dinner is a good portion of tuna, rice, and asparagus, but they didn't just fly the tuna in today (or last week) as it wasn't the best piece of tuna I've had.  The $9 salads would be good $6 salads, and nothing earth shattering.  So basically, if they toned down the upscaleness, my expectations might be lowered and I'd accept it for what it is."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have Harvest Kitchen in Solon!  I've been there once and will definitely be back.  I had the Crispy Fried Chicken Livers with Anson Mills grits to start.  WOW!  Perfectly seasoned and great texture.  Others at my table had the duck fat fries, lamb meatballs, the \"big eye\" tuna sashimi, and the hanky-pankys.  (How fun?!  Hanky-pankys!)  Of course we shared and I'd recommend everything I sampled!  For my main course I chose one of the fish specials.  (I'm embarassed to say I can't remember the type of fish.  Pacific Blue Marlin?)  I was definitely a fan.  My husband had the filet (also a special).  We were both impressed with our dishes.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.  Maybe next time I'll try the Arctic Char?"}
{"text":"It is great to actually have an upscale place to go to dinner in Solon.  Unique menu with everything tasting great.  Service is wonderfully, and the drinks are great as well.  Would go again and again"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal last Saturday night. We had a party of eight and each meal was fantastic. The staff was very attentive and spent a lot of time with us discussing meal options. The food is truly outstanding. I was incredibly impressed with the Vegan/Vegetarian options as well as the fish. The chef was 100% on target. I would encourage any foodie to make the trip. We typically go downtown for great food...now we can just head the other way on the highway!!!"}
{"text":"Someone call the police because I just got robbed.  I was very hesitant to go to Harvest based on the Yelp reviews and I should have trusted my instincts.  My group had reservations but waited well over an hour for a table even though other tables became available.  My wife ordered an appetizer which our server forgot about but maybe that was a good thing considering the other appetizers we ordered (fois gras/Caesar Salad)  were not worth the wait or the money.  You can find fresher Romaine lettuce at Giant Eagle.  My wife's Lobster Ravioli was good but it didn't taste anything like Lobster Ravioli...more like spicy Italian sausage ravioli with canned shrimp.  The short ribs were also good but the Wild Boar Tenderloin and the vegetables that accompanied it were under cooked and not edible.  A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Our server told us to come back on a Monday implying that things would be better...seriously?  Come back on a Monday?  If you are going to charge high end prices for food, you better be able to handle a holiday or weekend.  We were also told (several times) by restaurant staff members that it was \"Chuck E Cheese Night\" - a reference to the amount of children in the restaurant.  I had ZERO issues with the any of the children - my issues were with the bad service and subpar food.  Our server also suggested that we restrain from posting anything negative about the restaurant on Yelp...sorry but after paying over $100 for a meal that I couldn't even finish, I am definitely sharing this experience.  On a side note, as we were leaving I saw what looked like a delicious plate of French Fries...they were probably $15 but I would have paid considering how hungry I was after \"eating\" at Harvest.  Trust me everyone - DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Only upscale place in Solon.   You would pass it right by as it's off the main Rt 91 drag.   Interesting menu. I had the seasonal butternut squash ravioli which had great promise from the description and awesome ingredients but....something was really salty in it maybe the sauce base??   I would go back though!  Great wine list!"}
