{"text":"We should have walked out when the very-obviously-not-Amish woman with short hair and makeup met us at the reception counter. This place is absolutely nothing but a tourist trap, and a lousy one at that. You're sent through \"Amish-made\" furniture, and lots of \"antiques\" before you even get to where the buffet is served. The buffet had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, \"homemade\" noodles, corn, green beans, fish, a salad bar, and not much else. There was a broccoli/cauliflower salad that was slightly sour--not sure if that was intentional or not--and a few pitiful-looking desserts on the dessert bar. We tried a little bit of everything, and ended up feeling sick the rest of the day. The only thing we could attribute it to was our stop at this \"Amish\" buffet. Bottom line: it's not Amish, and it's not good. Try anywhere else, or better yet a genuine Amish restaurant for a real honest-to-goodness Amish experience."}
{"text":"The place was vacant, so that probably should have been a hint but we decided to try it anyway. It was like a 3rd rate Golden Corral with a fourth of the choices. The fried chicken was the only redeeming option. Everything else was either totally bland or looked like it had been sitting in the warming tray for hours. Will never EVER go back!"}
{"text":"In agreement with \"Cammie H\" and others regarding the food. For someone to say they loved the food, they must love unseasoned bland food. 
$12 per person is too much to spend.
The seating arrangement is very hodge podge... tables placed on all types of angles, making it a zig-zag way to the buffet.  
\"Cracker Barrel\" is a much better choice.
 If this is \"Amish style food\", then I am not happy about it... I'm out."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for a very long time.  Had an opportunity to a couple of weeks ago.  I was disappointed.  I thought it was a little pricey.  I think it was $12.00 a person.  The food choices are limited.  I don't recall anything I tried striking me as fantastic.  It was just plain and bland.  I would not go back unless I was with a group of people who wanted to go.  Then I would only pay for the soup and salad,"}
{"text":"Fun stop with absolutely wonderful food. Their gravy is better than mine. I would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"This buffet is actually pretty good. Comparing it to the greasy all-you-can eats up in Champaign, I would put this place at the top spot for best buffet in the area.   It's not like one of those 100+ options.... but they give you a decent selection of homemade food.  I went for lunch (for about $10.30 including a drink)-- so there were two soup options (chicken noodle and cream of broccoli), a hot bar (with fried chicken, fried pollack, ribs, noodles, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, green beans, and corn), a full salad bar (garden, caesar, all the fixins, homemade dressings, waldorf salads, corn salads, pea salad), and a big dessert bar (all are homemade so you've got brownies, fruit cups, strawberry shortcake, pudding, jello and tapioca).   
If you get the fried chicken as soon as they bring it out, it is SOOOOO good.  The corn, green, beans and mashed potatoes are above average --- it doesn't come out of a box or a can.  The fish is ok.   I wasn't a fan of the mac n cheese -- I know it's homemade, but you can taste the flour.   The salad bar is great.  Lots of options.   The desserts are fattening and usually warrant a second or third trip.... but you must try the tapioca... it's to die for!!!  So fluffy and yummy!!!    

The service is also very quick --- the lady rings you in quickly and plates are cleared away super fast.  The decor is downhome Amish --- all handmade tables and pretty old-folks home looking, but it is the area!

Considering what else is in the immediate area (Dennys, Pizza Hut, BK and DQ), this is your best bet by far!!!!  Not 5 star dining, but a good change of pace from fast greasy food."}
{"text":"\"Amish\" ???   more like \"Ummmm-ish\"!!!  We planned one \"good meal\" stop on our 12 hr drive.  When we saw \"Amish buffet,\" everyone agreed this sounded good.  so, we passed up typical fast food places to go here & ended up Blowing our budget on LOW quality food... Even the coffee was bad.  I tried seveal items on the entre line- all tasted worse than school cafeteria fod. i decided to try salad but  the salad bar was very scarce in variety.Very disappointing- especially for something with \"Amish\" in the name.  I doubt it is truly home-made as one would expect.  We should've gone to McDOnalds!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a whole lot more. But it was a big buffet area with only one side open. Their main entrees were limited to basically fried chicken, fried shrimp, steak and some slivers of ham. The salad bar hardly had salad type ingredients but consisted of 12 types of jello. The dessert section lacked anything I would call \"Amish cooking\" (where's the apple pie?).

The food itself was good...what was actually out there. But for the $12 a head, it's not worth the price. Plus the restrooms were super scary."}
{"text":"We did not eat here. They have shops in here and it looks like a giant flea market of things that most people would not normally associate with the Amish. It's a tourist trap. The one store, which has furniture and wood things was alright. I feel that calling it Amishland is misguided. They trap you into walking around their entire flea market in order to get to the buffet and the bathrooms. I don't think I'll ever stop there again."}
{"text":"I was expecting alot more out of the food and was so disappointed. The only thing neat is the antiques. Don't expect much of the food."}
{"text":"Went there at around 3 30 there was hardly any food out and what little there was it was cold and had no flavor....husband and I were dissapointed!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat at the restaurant, I did the shopping.  I was disappointed to find out that only the very beginning of the store is Amish.  The rest is just regular people with sections selling a bunch of stuff that you would normally find at a garage sale.  There is some ok stuff, it is a higher quality garage sale, but nevertheless...

The Amish make beautiful furniture but it was EXPENSIVE!!  I know, it is all hand made.  Anyway,  I guess I was expecting the entire place to be Amish because the name is AMISHLAND and I was disappointed that it wasn't but it still was a neat place."}
{"text":"Love the food. One of my favorite places to eat. Several unique salad bar selections and good fried chicken, noodles, fish, etc. I generally eat too much trying a little of everything.

Negatives for me are the limited hours and slightly smaller selection than in past years."}
{"text":"This is more of a small cafeteria than a buffet. Your choices are very limited and the food is of average quality. The only thing that was Amish about this place was the word they used in the name."}
{"text":"Superb food tried all most all couldn't find anything bad looked great and tasted great also"}
{"text":"OK, so as of 8/2/2014, this place is NOT CLOSED. It is open and there are people streaming in and out of this Red Barn. Came here on a Saturday with family and while its not the genuine 'Amishland' of your dreams, they do have many Amish goods sold here. They have a small cheese barn, where you can buy Amish made cheeses (I bought the Chipotle, garlic, and curds), homemade jams (sugar free as well), and candies. I also snagged some pumpkin butter, sugar free (yum!), and blueberry jam for $2.89 each. No preservatives too. The furniture is extremely lavish and the craftsmanship is oozing from the rocking chairs to the smooth desks. If you can fork out the money, this is your place.

Also, this place is a mix of a garage sale and a thrift store in every nook and cranny. Some outdated stuff, other cool finds. I bought an antique record book holder for 78s for only $2, and some classic novels for under $15. You'll never know what you find if you look!

Great for the family-there's a lot of space to cover and move around. The kids will especially like the horse statue and buggy you can pose in. 

The buffet was very good, I'd say a notch above Old Country. Might not seem like much, but their fried chicken was GOOD. Crunchy cornmeal crust provided that bite. Cabbage and mashed potatoes with gravy, also GOOD. Meatloaf, not shabby, fried shrimp, tasty. Macaroni, eh. They also have sliced bread and butter, green beans, sliced potatoes, seasoned corn, ham/turkey on the side, 2 soups (I had broccoli cheddar-the other was chicken noodle) and salad bar. Desserts are ho-hum. Lots of Watergate salad and others that follow suit. I think I covered it all.

The best advice I can give is don't come here with high expectations. A little biting, yes, because you are supplying their service, after all. I say this because if you do, like most of the previous yelpers, you base their experience to the level of Amish-ness that this place exudes, which is not very much. I would rather they omit the Amishland and leave it to Red Barn Antiques/Goods. The point is not to come here all the time. It's more or less like a once every one/two months, if that."}
