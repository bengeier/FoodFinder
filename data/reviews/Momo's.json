{"text":"Very courteous and friendly staff. Very fine vegetarian and meat dishes. I think it's mostly a Lebanese restaurant. They also have some nice desserts. Their spiced carrot cake was rich and memorable."}
{"text":"I love the food here and come here all the time! It's reasonably prices and authentic!  I ordered the rack of lamb, and it  seasoned very well.  I also ordered the spinach pie, which was fresh and moist, as well as a side of grilled shrimp. Everything was so well cooked.  My wife had the fatuosh salad and the falafel plate and also loved his meal. He said it was one of the best fatoush salads he's ever had. Also, the restaurant is very cute--the patio is its selling point, especially during the summer.  It has grape vines on the overhead, which you can pick off and eat!  At the end of the night,  we went over to the Momo's groceteria next door and took bought some zataar and meat pies--which was incredibly affordable! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I will remember that I haven't been to Momo's in a while and pay it a visit. I always get the lentil soup and spinach pie platter. The hummus is also very creamy - it is great for sharing.  Food aside, the best feature of this restaurant is their vine covered patio. I always take friends there and they are impressed by the patio..."}
{"text":"The second star is for the grape-vine covered patio. The first one is for not being horrible.   The place is quite pricey for the kind of food they serve ($15 for something you can get for $7). The food is okay but had sand in it - yep. I thought I'm imagining things until my boyfriend made the same comment. The service is okay - the servers are lethargic and look like they are about to do laundry: I don't expect a black tie but a little self respect would be nice.    I would come back for the patio to have a drink, but never for the food. blergh."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We were looking forward to spinach pie somewhere in our 'hood...I have to say everything was sub par:  - tomato salad was not fresh; veggies were tired and soggy - flat bread tasted like it had been sitting at the back of a spice store for way too long -- took all night to get the horrible taste out of my mouth - olives had a funny aftertaste - red wine was warm (ew) - spinach pie was so-so; had no flavour   I suppose the lentil soup was okay, but I've had much better. It's pretty bland.  I'm writing this in the hope Momo's will change its ways; I hate panning independent businesses and I'm not a picky eater but wow. It was bad. Maybe just an off night, but we won't be returning to find out.  Our server was very nice, however a different server pounded on the bathroom door while I was in it."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Portions are generous! I had the kafta plate with half salad, half home fries. The outside seating is really nice."}
{"text":"My enjoyment of Momo's goes back many years. As with many guests, the comfortable location in the U of T campus location gives it a friendly, campusy feel. Mostly you'll see students, professors, and alumni.  Fare-wise, the dishes are usually good, but not stellar. Avoid the shawarma and go for more \"full meat\" (lamb, chicken breast) or vegetarian options.  The quality of the extras like salads, soups, hummus, home fries, etc. is what will really make you smile. The lentil soup is pretty much my favorite - delish.  Service is high class all the way with a comfortable, \"family\" feeling."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Great patio. Good food.  The inside is kind of blah, but the staff is friendly, and I always have a good time here.  I recommend the vegetarian combination plate or the spinach pie plate.  Warning, it's a TON of food.  The plates often start off with a lentil soup, then you get a huge salad plus whatever you ordered, so go here hungry.  One thing is that I'm pretty sure they've ramped up their prices in the last year or two.  It used to be more in the 12 dollar range(if i remember correctly) and now its more like 15 to 17.  I guess they're going upscale like the rest of Harbord."}
{"text":"It's not hard to find Middle Eastern food in the UofT area, yet for some reason I'd always come back to Momo's.  It's closer to the campus than Ghazale, much more authentic than Pita Pit, and a nice enough place to go with a group.  I always got the hummus - whether I'd accompany it with falafel or salad or just have it in a sandwich.  The hummus isn't the *best* I've had (okay, well, I grew up on Israeli food, so I've had some flippin' good hummus) but it's still solid.  They top it with some olive oil... mmm.  Get extra pita, which they'll char on the grill for you.  There's outdoor seating, but given that it's Toronto, it's only open a few months a year.  The inside is understated and cozy.  No-frills tables and chairs, and open kitchen if you sit towards the front.  The staff is always nice and generally unobtrusive.  Prices are decent too.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Came in to Momo's because... well, to tell you the truth, I was a bit tipsy following an open bar at an early evening cocktail event, and I needed something to fill up my stomach before continuing on with my night's activities (lest I be falling down drunk before 9pm like some sort of amateur).   I ordered the New York Strip Steak, which came with the tastiest lentil soup ever. it's pureed, which I wasn't expecting -- so it has a smooth consistency, and really is delicious. The steak, on the other hand, wasn't so great -- it was tough and not very flavorful. I liked the lentil rice that accompanied it, though.   Service was pretty quick and friendly. The restaurant has a large patio that must be nice in the summer; I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"Excellent! Love the tabouleh and lentil soup."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not for take-out, even though they have take-out available. Unfortunately, that was what I was there for. I had to wait a good while for it (about 25 minutes), so not a quick stop on the way home or a late night.  The food there is ok. I ordered a chicken shish tawook. I was going to order the shawarma but was a little spooked by the fact the entire spit was covered in aluminum foil. The chicken was not too flavourful and needed more sauce. It comes with a side salad. The salad was very under-dressed.  I give it 3 stars only because I'm sure its much better when you sit in. It has a nice friendly ambience and the sit-in diners are clearly their focus."}
{"text":"The place has a charming decent sized side patio and its covered in grape vines. I really like the feel of it.  As well, they have very good vegetarian/vegan options. I've had the grilled vegetable platter and I love it. But a lot of their sides and appetizers are quite good as well."}
{"text":"Right now  I am eating the best pita I have ever had in my entire life. It's still warm from the oven, fluffy inside and slightly crunchy outside. I'm dipping it in some of Momo's smoky home made babaganouj (forget that eggplant-flavoured mayonnaise crap they sell in supermarkets) and some fresh tabouli.  Most people know Momo's for the restaurant out front, but around the corner on Robert, they've just opened up a teensy bakery and grocery store that's packed to the rafters with delicious homemade Lebanese food and fresh-baked bread, pastries and pies. They have takeaway containers of dishes like lamb curry, chicken molokhia (chicken cooked in a sauce made of a spinach-like vegetable), beef and veggie stew, fresh yogurt, lentil rice, dips... everything you could want for a lunchtime feast or a healthy takeaway dinner. Plus it's cheap: I got a chicken molokhia (large enough for two with some sides), a tub of babaganouj, tub of tabouli, a fresh pita and a Middle Eastern soft drink for around $12. They also sell all kinds of imported Lebanese products, jars of pickles, sauces, etc etc etc. The place is a GOLDMINE. I work nearby and used to be restricted to a Subway, two crappy pizza places, or a spectacularly bad Chinese for my lunch options. No longer! I am thrilled about Momo's bakery and grocery--long may they prosper!"}
{"text":"Momos would be 3 star except every place with a kick-ass patio gets +1 from me just because I love patios. This patio is nice too, overhead trellis with grape vines!  I would definitely hit up this place again but ONLY in patio weather. I checked out the interior and it's very blas√© - clean but plain and nothing going on with decor whatsoever.  They have awesome sangria here. Real sangria, reminded me exactly of the stuff I would drink in Spain. Mostly wine and fruit, NOT loaded with sugar or fruit juice, so it tastes mostly like wine. It had apple slices, orange slices, grapes and cinnamon sticks added. Nice. A half liter came out looking more like a full liter, and it was only $17.  They have a lunch menu, most items are around $9-$10 for a sandwich and salad combo. My buddy had a MOMO burger, which was ground lamb in a pita with tzatziki and she chose a side caesar. I had a chicken shish tawoo plate with hummus, pita, and a big garden salad for $14. Food was better than average, really fresh, but not anything too special.  The service was quick and they were really friendly even though we were using a WagJag coupon.  Note the website menu is out of date. Prices are now slightly higher."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today: a bowl of lentil soup & a tomato salad. Both were good, but very simple.  The lentil soup was pureed and mildly spiced, with a lemon wedge on the side.  The salad consisted of chopped tomatoes, cucumber, green peppers, and onion, with 2 black olives.  Nice light lunch, but there is no reason  a small and simple lunch like this should come to $13 with tax and tip.  Everything on the menu seemed a bit overpriced- e.g., a falafel plate for $12.99 (?!).  At these prices I don't know how Momo's has been around long enough for its decor to become so dated.  The owners and staff seemed nice, but there's a mismatch between what you pay & what you get, in my opinion.  *Just noticed that their website has very out-of-date prices, which in itself is kind of annoying.  Seems like every Toronto restaurant has either a website from 1999 that's never been updated, or else a 2007 flash website that forces you to watch a musical vignette before allowing you to search around for the downloadable pdf containing their hours of operation."}
{"text":"Sadly, MoMo's has quietly closed. Over the years we had eaten there off and on, because it had a great outdoor patio covered by grape vines. It was a lovely place to sit on a hot summer day, watching the world go by.  The food however, was never that consistent, sometimes really good other times no better than that found in a falafel place. About a year ago their prices increased without any measurable increase in the quality of the food, making it too expensive for what they served. Sad to see them go, but wondering what will fill the space they left."}
{"text":"After living literally down the street from it, I decided to do take out one day. It was good. I went back for more take out. It was still pretty good.  Growing up, my family's favourite restaurant was Lebanese and I've spent some time in the Middle East, so I feel I at least know what I am talking about it when it comes to this cuisine.  The menu is good, with standard Levantine fare and a few of my favourite things, such as fatoush salad. Take out is pretty speedy and the people who work there are nice and everyone is served with a complimentary pita.  I really like walking past the patio (which I do all the time) and looking at everyone. They all seem so happy to be there, out on the patio."}
