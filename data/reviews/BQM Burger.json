{"text":"Off to a rough start. 

Chain burger sports bar place. The Good: Beer selection, grilled cheese bacon burger, one apologetic and sensitive waiter.  The Weird: somehow the TV screens are misplaced, difficult to watch, distracting.  The Bad: incredibly slow and confused service.

Perhaps it will get better, otherwise ignore completely and go to the Rude Boy"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this neat joint and this is definitely one of the best places in the neighbourhood. Staff is super nice, our group really enjoyed the food and drinks. Prices were very reasonable with daily specials. Cool music and decor.  Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I have visited this restaurant a few times and have been so happy with each visit.  The waitress each time was attentive and service was quick - even with a full house! I think it was either the owner or manager who was there one time and he went above and beyond and checked in on us to make sure we were good.  The burgers are so delicious!!!! And the fries....honestly worth the visit. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"While the handcrafted in house burger was excellent in everyway....
It was the homemade onion rings which sealed the deal..... $5 drafts from local craft breweries washed it all down.....try this place...youll be most impressed and unlike other places in the area.....its not going to leave your wallet in shatters..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery off UberEATS. Food arrived earlier than anticipated and Was decently good! Wasn't the best burger but considering it was delivery and didn't arrive soggy is a thumbs up for me."}
{"text":"Tried it twice, painfully slow. Free drinks does not make it worth waiting an hour and a half for substandard food. Meanwhile they were sending out takeout orders the while time. Very disappointing, the dining room should be a priority over takeout."}
{"text":"Nice little eatery serving up directly what they advertise, good quality meat and beers. I'm not a fan of draught as businesses rarely clean or change the lines but I had bottled beaus lug tread, always excellent, and a big juicy burger made with chuck. The server was very friendly and the meal was tasty. Ambience is a little dingy but overall a nice place to grab a quick bite and is solid competition for other businesses in roncy."}
{"text":"Best night time burgers in town!

Well, the proper description of the place is \"fries are ok, burgers are really good\" as from what I learned from guests from other neighborhoods. I can't agree or disagree as I always take burger with onion rings or salad, but come and try, you won't regret.

Besides the great burgers, the place looks nice and clean. Eventho the kitchen is right on the bar, there is no smell or anything.

What else to add.. services are F&F (fast and friendly)"}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not really good either. If you want 12$ piece of meat that has as much taste as cardboard, BQM is for you. Meat was dry and weird too, ordered the Ossington and the BQM classic, both were flavourless despite being advertised as slathered in \"garlic aioli\" and horseradish sauce. However, the fries had enough salt to stop Ronald McDonald's heart so I guess they tried to make up for the tasteless burgers by doing that. 2/10 would definitely not order again."}
{"text":"Great place!!! just tried this place for the first time today. The poutine is authentic French Canadian poutine with real curds, not the fake stuff like other places. The cheese burger was delicious and big. It was a full meal. Nice patio, The service was great. I will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup tonight after having a few great experiences here. The server was screaming down the phone at us because her phone was broken, then we arrived to pick up and were told that one of items we ordered wasn't available (and then almost still got charged for it). Then we got home and literally none of our food had been salted -- not our fries, onion ring batter or our burger patties. Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe it. Hope they were just having a bad night."}
{"text":"Tried it a few times...failed to impress every time.  Not sure if the other BQM franchises are the same, but definitely will not go back to this one.  I've tried the wings, burgers and fries and you can get far better on the street.  Beer selection is OK and its nice they have a patio, but with some many alternatives on Roncy I can't see why anyone would go there."}
{"text":"Terrible in every way. I really wanted to like this place. It's in the hood and I love burgers and beer. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was almost empty. Things didn't start off well. When attempting to order beer from the menu it seemed they didn't have several of them. The waitress gave us a typed page which listed the beers and again several of them were not available. Not a big deal but how hard is it to have an accurate list of beers especially when that is a feature at the restaurant. We should have called it a day then, but we ordered burgers which seemed to take a long time. When they arrived they were both overdone. We ordered them medium-rare and they were both well done. So we sent them back and  waited. No other customers and it must have taken 10 more minutes and guess what. Both arrived overdone again but we were so hungry we ate them. They forgot to put bacon on my daughter's burger. All and all they pretty much got everything wrong. 
I get places have off nights. But they have an opportunity to make things better by comping something from the bill. Not a chance here. Paid over $50 for this disaster of a meal."}
{"text":"I have been here 3x - they have fantastic, delicious burgers with creative combinations of toppings. However, every single time I have waited + minutes for my burger in an empty or near-empty restaurant. Each time, staff haven't acknowledged the wait or apologized. My first visit, they forgot our beer orders and (once reminded) didn't bring them until after we had finished eating. My most recent visit, they messed up both of our sides (salad instead of fries, and fries instead of sweet potato fries). Despite the great burgers I'm not sure if putting up with the consistently bad service is worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, super personal hospitality, what else would you want in a craft burger place? 5 stars."}
