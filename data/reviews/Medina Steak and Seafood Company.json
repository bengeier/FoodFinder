{"text":"Very good food and friendly customer service.  Save yourself the expense of visiting a Morton's or Hyde Park- you will enjoy the same quality of food and far less arrogance."}
{"text":"Got talked into going to this place again No improvement over the last time Its really cold and drafty the food is not prepared well fried items are greasy my burger was burnt to a crisp I asked for it med rare I will not be back. I'm sure Yelp will bury this review just like my last one"}
{"text":"Very good.     Plank salmon - 4 stars.  Tilapia special -j4.  Strip steak med rare, rosemary fries - 5.  Seafood stew - 5, pasta 2.5 - all stuck together.  Good service."}
{"text":"Party of 4 went on a Sat night. Fortunately we had a 5:30 pm reservation because by 6 pm place was packed. Everyone had different meal. All great. The sirlion steak and filet medallions were outstanding. Nice selection of sides and salad dressings. A munber of specialty beers. While a little pricy it's high on my list when hungry for steak."}
{"text":"My other half & I went there for dinner. Bad mistake. It took the waitress/host to bring our food a GOOD HALF AN HOUR. There were people that came in after us, & got their food quicker then we did. That is not right. My other half got the salmon with creamy dill sauce & green beans. He liked the salmon but he said that it was not as good as other places we have been. I got the 10 oz filet mignon, with the green beans. I did not like the green beans, they were chewy/al dente. I do not like my veggies that way. I like them where you don't have to use a knife to cut them. The rolls were good but I would not recommend this place for a good dinner. I can see why they offer coupons. They need all the help that they can get. The bar is decent but that is all. The restaurant alone has nice pictures of Medina Square downtown. Those are nice to look at while you are waiting for your food.  The food was not all that cheap either. My other half said that they had good coffee. I got a soda & you can't go wrong there.  I do not think that the meal was worth almost $60.00 with tip."}

{"text":"I'm seriously the first person to review this place?? Then again, if I had seen a review, I probably would have tried Medina Steak and Seafood earlier. I've driven by, I've seen the ads, but I figured, \"Meh, it's a small town steak place. No reviews on Yelp. Can't possibly be that good\". DEAD WRONG. My new favorite place in the Medina area. Even my fave in the whole Akron area. Besides Lanning's....but this is affordable, so I can eat here much more often.   Don't let the location throw you. It's west of Medina Square, in what appears to be an old house or possibly an old restaurant. I mean old. The outside has been refreshed, but the inside is well...refreshingly quaint and antique-y. It kind of reminded us of some spots in Hudson. We happened to be on that side of town, hungry, and tired of the same old places.   SO glad we stopped. The service was great...seriously the best service we've had in Medina...and the food was awesome too. Even something as mundane as the dinner salad was done well - fresh greens (no bagged crap!) with a housemade white french. I LOVE white french and will go out of my way for it. :)  Our appy choice of bacon-wrapped scallops were HOT and perfectly cooked. Same can be said for our entrees. There was no sitting around under the heatlamps. I'm impressed when that happens. I opted for a prime rib sandwich, BF had a filet mignon. Perfectly cooked. Perfectly seasoned. YUM!  The only thing they were kind of lacking on was dessert. Nothing really piqued my appetite. I mean, they have dessert, but the usual kind of stuff...chocolate cake, cheesecake, etc.  Equally well-served for a casual dinner/lunch, as well as date-night-out, they even have a solid beer and wine list. I was not expecting that from a 'hometown' place that I never hear anyone talk about. Perhaps they were all keeping this secret...oops, sorry if I've blown that one out of the water. ;)  UPDATED - Jan 2014: We went back a couple of times in fall/winter 2013. I have to say that there is a lack of consistency here. The food is good, but not as great as my first visit...we ordered bacon-wrapped scallops again - the bacon was overcooked while the scallops seemed a bit undercooked. Service also not as great as the first try. But, I AM still happy that they have White French salad dressing, so I'm only dropping them to 4-stars. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Drafty made it uncomfortable. Turn on the heat.It was freezing in the dining room."}
{"text":"The restaurant has just completed a $100,000 upgrade and the menu has been updated. Have never visited the restaurant before the upgrade I cannot comment on what is was like, but we had a great evening the service was great and the food was well priced and the portions and presentation good. Only downside they ran out of ice-cream for desert but had a fair selection of additional choices."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the food was good as was the service. I've had tastier black & bleu burgers, but it was cooked to perfection, true medium rare like I like them. My husband's French dip was also excellent. I also commend them for not undercooking the asparagus spears. I would come here again in a heartbeat.This place is said to be haunted but we didn't run into any spirits."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have made this a frequent weekend dinner spot. Their food is always fresh tasting and well put together. I have enjoyed every dish I have ordered there. Their duck confit gnocchi special was my favorite and I often find myself craving their angel hair pasta and scallops. It's off the square so we never have to wait long and the service is always wonderful!"}
