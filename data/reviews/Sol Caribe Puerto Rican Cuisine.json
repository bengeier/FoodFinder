{"text":"Ate here on New years eve and the Pastele and empanada was good. The owners are super nice and they go out of there way to make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Good quick service. Delicious food! Ordered the Mofongo con Carne Frita, mofongo had the perfect amount of garlic, it was moist, easy to eat.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"excellent food by amazing chef Jorge and great service by the owner angel who have me personalized service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Feels like good home cooked Puerto Rican meal! the people are so friendly and nice, it's almost like talking to a longtime friend or family member but most of all food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm half puerto Rican and from NY so when I moved to arizona it was literally impossible to find authentic puerto Rican food that even came close to my grandmother's cooking. Or even close to the PR restaurants in NY that we love. Every place my sister and I tried out here that claimed to be a puerto Rican restaurant always ended up having a Mexican twist, it was never true to what we grew up eating. Sol caribe is 100% authentic and tastes exactly like it should from actual puerto ricans. I got the pernil with Arroz con gandules and it was so flavorful and a good size for what you pay. The owner is so friendly and really cares about you being happy with the food. Its a small little place but those are usually the best anyway. So excited I finally found a place I can go to whenever I have a craving."}
{"text":"Wow! Pretty dang amazing! We went on our honeymoon to Puerto Rico a couple of months ago and have been dying for a little taste of the island. Thankfully we have found it! A quaint little restaurant with outstanding flavor and wonderful aromas. The menu is simple but the flavors of even the rice are robust. Make sure you take a Lil trip to this side of the world!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! I am a visiting puertorican and I found this place by pure luck. As a native, the food is spot on in taste and appearance."}
{"text":"Sol Caribe has all the wonderful characteristucs of an Island restaurant .  The ambiance is quaint, the service is friendly and the menu offers a broad range of traditional Puerto Rican favorites. Moreover, ithe quality of the food is exceptional. The flavors are simply outstanding!  Consequently, I expect Sol Caribe to be a major culinary hotspot in the regionEven if you've  never tried Puerto Rican cuisine, visit Sol Caribe. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"La comida estuvo deliciosa. The food was amazing. Everyone needs to try this place. Boricua, jibarito, if your home sick, this is the place to be. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok owners of Sol Caribe.  You are here by a miracle of G-d because the 3 prior restaurants in this location have gone defunct--meaning out-of-business.  It seems that this locale is an unlucky spot but as I always say, People will flock to good food.   Well, here is the first thing you don't do in your restaurant.  You don't tell a Puertorican patron raised in NYC, partially in the Bronx, that you don't have hot sauce because \"Puertoricans don't eat hot sauce\".  Really?  Even Applebees has a bottle of hot sauce.  I am not saying carry 12 different kinds of hot sauces.  I am saying one bottle.  99 cents in Food City.  Of course Puertoricans eat hot sauce!! Ever heard of homemade \"Pique\"?  Come on now.   Ordered the mofongo with Carne Frita.  When I asked about the sauce that comes with it , Maria, the very polite and sweet waitress (5 stars for her) said: \"mayo-ketchup\".  I said Mayo-Ketchup?????? and then Sweet Maria was going to explain.  No need to explain. Ketchup and Mayonnaise mixed together.  They call that French dressing.  I don't remember Ponce De Leon (explorer and first Governor of Puerto Rico) putting that on his mofongo.  Let's keep a Puertorican dish like Mofongo authentic.  You can have either chicken broth or gravy from stewed chicken or the gravy from \"carne guisada\" on it.  But not Mayo-Ketchup.  That is an American invention and this is not an American restaurant.  Remember... \"Puerto Rican Cuisine\".   The mofongo which was served with a few pieces of carne frita and a lettuce and tomato salad, was ok--not dry.  The meat was a tad salty.   Hubby ventured into the grilled chicken breast with arroz con gandules.  I discouraged him from having the grilled chicken because I knew they were going to overcook it as most latin restaurants tend to do with their beef, chicken or any other protein.  But stubbornness found its way into his head again (I thought I had vacated \"stubbornness along with selfishness but stubbornness found its way back) and ordered it anyway.  Well, not only was it overdone but no taste to it.  You have to MARINATE meat folks, especially chicken breast.  A little extra virgin olive oil with fresh chopped garlic, salt, pepper, oregano and a twist of lime and you will have a piece of grilled chicken breast that will make you spin on your head. So simple.  The dish had rice and lettuce and tomatoes.  Rice was ok. Nothing to write home about.   Here is my advice to new owners: 1.  Never say you don't have hot sauce, it sounds stupid. 2.  Hold back on the salt on the fried pork.   3.  Serve your mofongos with chicken broth on the side or gravy from one of your stewed meats.  Save the mayo-ketchup for hamburger if you serve any.  4.  Marinate your meats before grilling.  They will taste better. 5.  Keep Sweet Maria working there.  She was the highlight of our visit."}
{"text":"Simple. Quaint. Delicious. Three easy words to help describe this new restaurant. As soon as we came in we were greeted by the nicest lady, Amy, who told us about their menu and how they had recently opened. My buddy and I each ordered a sandwich and split it so we got to try both.   While we were waiting, Amy brought out samplers of rice, chicken stew, and beef stew. All of which were great and the meats were cooked perfectly. The sandwiches were even better. The Tripleta was delicious. It had steak, pork, ham, and swiss cheese with mayo ketchup. It was phenomenal tasting and definitely filling. The Cubano was no different and had similar meats with mustard and pickles.   It may be hard to find, but if you're looking for great Puerto Rican cuisine at a great price, it's worth a stop. The service was great and you can bet I'll be stopping in again."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations on how good it would taste. If you are looking for authentic puertorrican food, look no further. To top it off, the service was excellent. It really hit home for me. Definitely going back even though I live in Tucson. Have the Mofongo with Carne Frita and try out their natural juices."}
{"text":"Sol Caribe is a wonderful, mostly unknown spot not far from Scottsdale and McDowell. Caribbean food in general and Puerto Rican food in particular is fragrant (it's the garlic), hearty (it's the garlic) and satisfying (it's the garlic).     And they play great salsa music here. Pounce."}
{"text":"Decent representation of the island but I'd personally go with some of the better Cuban spots in town next time I'm craving something from the region.  The chuleta was mostly bone and fat, the bistec empanizado was very heavy on the breading.  The service was good and I do appreciate the efforts of the family running the place."}
{"text":"I am going to start by saying that this may be a bias review considering I am Puerto Rican and raised on the island.  my expectations of my native food are very high. That being said. I really want to love this place.  The good: the service is amazing! Everyone is polite. You are greeted at the door checked in at your table enough to know you are cared for but not too much to where you are annoyed. The small restaurant is well decorated and very clean. It's simple yet has enough vibrancy to remind you of their Latin roots! The desserts are delicious and they provide a good portion! Btw free dessert when you check in!   The bad (not really bad but meh!) again I am a harsh critic. The food was ok. Some items I was like wow and the others were like oh no! The sandwiches were delicious, the frituras (fried goods) were not. The whole time I was there I'm thinking ugh I should have called mom and had her cook. But if you're not as fortunate as I am to have a little lady cooking up heaven at home then please stop by here. You will at least get a taste of Sazon!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Wish they had more on their menu to choose from. Ordered the shrimp creole which had only 5 shrimp. Kinda plain tasting. Customer service was very good. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Cuban style food and it was fantastic! The Cubans and tripleto sandwich were great! Awesome staff that let us try new food since it was our first experience. Family owned and still getting on its feet."}
{"text":"Mmmm. So good. Everything about this place is authentic. From the decor to the food to the fans on the ceiling.  We had alcapurria (root vegetables shredded and shaped into a dough ball stuffed with seasoned ground meat and then fried) mofongo (fried plantains mashed up with butter and garlic) with carne frita (fried chunks of pork), and arroz con gandules (seasoned rice with pigeon peas).  Holy Moly! The pork was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The mofongo was buttery  garlic heaven. Yum. We topped it off with a bread pudding dessert. Most excellent and firm, not mushy---I hate mushy. We also had the parcha juice made with REAL passion fruit pulp. So yummy!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and our server was quite nice. I was really surprised there were no tostones on the menu. OK, so I had the beef empanada. It was really good. Nice flaky crust and not too oily. I'm used to having chopped green olives in mine but I like this one a lot. Lastly, I had mofongo. The fried pork was really good. Crispy and the right amount of fat. The mofongo itself was colder than I am used to and it had way more garlic than any mofongo I ate while living in PR.   In the end, the food was ok. If you're in the mood for PR cuisine, there are better choices out there."}
{"text":"My wife is a great Puerto Rican cook and this place is really good.  I had rhe carne guisada, habichuela y arroz.  All of it was good.  Good portions, good price."}
{"text":"Cuban sandwich was not crisp, its actually still in my frig sadly for days ago... could barley eat one half. almost like sandwhich was reheated in microwave before they gave me my togo order. empanadas came half empty like they were premade at home and sold in store later outer shell was good but once u bit into It, disappointment began... smh I love empanadas but they werent so good this time. I usually order them from Jamaica restaurant and noticed this Cuban spot so wanted to try it out.  Maybe ill try something new next time. But idk.."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great service and the owners were very friendly. We have tried a lot of Puerto Rican food and this is by far the best. I had the cuban sandwich and it was so good I am definitely coming back.  (Very clean, too)"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp, and we couldn't be happier. This place can make so much food for such a good price! Their quality is out of this world, and their service is so kind. My family is Cuban and Dominican so this really hits the spot. Eat here without hesitation, this is real food!!"}
{"text":"Like everyone said, the pina colada was amazing! I had the pernil and the moro de guandules. I loved it. My husband had the mofongo and he loved it. The empanadas were great as well! We drove an hour to go here and it was worth it! Small intimate place... All it needed was some music... The owner came out and spoke to us, she was very sweet!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Sol Caribe is a new restaurant.  It is a find and I suggest you give it a try.  Help it get started, and treat yourself before it is so busy you will have to wait for a table.  Understand that Sol Caribe is a neighborhood ethnic restaurant, and I have rated it as such.  Here's how a smallish plain-looking cafe with simple food rates five stars in my book:  1.  It is very clean, bright, and comfortable despite the plastic chairs. 2.  The service is friendly and highly competent (our server knew the ingredients of every menu item), possibly because Sol Caribe is basically a husband-and-wife enterprise. 3.  The menu, classic Puerto Rican, has quite a number of interesting choices. 4.  The food, although simply-prepared, is also universally well-prepared, and this is the biggest factor for this type of restaurant -- \"can the cook cook?\".  5.  Prices were consistent with the type of restaurant (less than $10 for entrees), with appetizers and sides on the inexpensive side ($2-$3).   Specifics on the food: The appetisers consist of a half-dozen choices.  The ones our party tried were all top notch, including empanadas and a meat-filled cigar wrapped in a mixture containing plantain.  (Plantain appears in many dishes but it doesn't get boring because the preparations are so different).  The main courses were interesting and tasty.  The signature mofongo is a mound of plantain again, mixed with garlic and oil, and very tasty.  It comes either plain or with your choice of chicken, pork, or shrimp on the side.  For us, the small bytes of fried chicken were tasty and moist.  The roast pork was plain and looked dry but was actually very tasty.  It would still benefit from a sauce, such as a mojo.  The only miss of the night was the steak and onions, a classic dish which suffered because the meat itself was tough.  Each main course comes with a side, each of which was stellar.  We liked the plantains, both fried and sweet, and the rice with pigeon peas.  We had room for only one dessert between the four of us - a tres leches cake that was topped with coconut and shouldn't have been.  It was ok but by then we were not really interested in any more food.  Hint:  Sol Caribe is not really hard to find.  From McDowell, turn north on Granite Reef (which is 1/2 mile west of Rt. 101), and the restaurant is 1/2 block up on the right."}
{"text":"The best Empanadas I've ever eaten in the Continental US.   I feel like I may have said something similar to that before, but this time I really mean it. This is better than Republica Empanada and Sydney's. Better than anything I've had in the Valley by far. This rivals the empanadas I had in Puerto Rico a few months ago (which spawned this new obsession of mine).   This spot has been 4 different places in 3 years. It's a little off the beaten path, but I used to live a block from here up until a few months ago, so I've checked out every time it was something new. This is the cleanest and nicest I've seen the place... the most effort put into this location that I've seen so far.  The new owner did a lovely remodel of the inside - new paint - clean and colorful... it looks like something you would find in Old San Juan. The owner is from Puerto Rico, so there you go... hence the authenticity. The chairs and tables are all new and fall somewhere between Herman Miller and High School... they are comfy though, and everything is really clean.   Staff is nice and attentive. It's only been open a week apparently, but since it's on Granite Reef and not a main road, they probably haven't gotten a lot of foot traffic yet. I will definitely have to come back here to sample more than just empanadas... the menu is extensive. Having eaten both the beef and the chicken empanadas, I can tell you that they are both incredible - I can only imagine how awesome everything else is.  This will end up being my biggest regret for moving out of this neighborhood... now I guess we'll just have a longer commute to eat here. They said they may eventually offer delivery, but sadly I'm afraid I am outside of their potential range."}
{"text":"First timer, know nothing about Puerto Rican food. Met up with old college buddy who hails from Puerto Rico and says food here is authentic. All I know if it was delightful, I am sure a lot of it had to do with my companion.   It's a real dive hole in the wall, way too loud with very few patrons, hard to carry on a conversation and we were as far away as we could be from the only other table of guests. Voices bouncing off the walls.   Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Started out with the chicken empanadas and the pork pasteles. The pasteles was moist and very full of flavor. The Empanada was cooked perfectly, with a very light crispy crust on the pastry shell. Crispy pork pieces for dinner was amazing, my fiancé had one of the mofungo dishes, superb!! The tastes reminded of us of our PR island visit 4 months ago!!"}
{"text":"Best food ever definitely recommend this place every time i order something it reminds me of real puerto rican food yummm!!!"}
