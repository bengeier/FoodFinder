{"text":"Come for the coffee and friendly staff. 

A surprisingly close walk from the financial district. Its relatively new as it's been open for about 5 months. I was chatting with the owner/barista who said their liquor license is coming soon. 

They currently have a great deal on the Ritual app, $1.99 for your choice of a cappuccino, Campfire latte or Americano. My friend and I got a cappuccino and campfire latte. My cappuccino was a nice strong brew, and the campfire latte is for anyone with a sweet tooth (they even roast the marshmallows for you!). 

I also a food menu that has more than the usual cafe snacks of muffins and lemon squares. 

The cafe is a cool place to meet a friend or to do some work. Its got the simplistic, white & neutral. Right by the counter is a small staircase that leads to a quiet nook for reading. 

I'm rooting for this local shop!"}
{"text":"This place is newly opened on the north side of Adelaide at Church, close to St James Cathedral. The coffee is from a local roaster and tastes pretty good. It is no better or worse than the other independent competition in the surrounding area. Prices here are a bit higher than others, with espresso starting at $3 plus tax with an extra uplift for an americano. Freshly roasted beans are available in half pound bags. A variety of cookies and cakes are available for purchase - all made in house. These taste ok, but are a bit diminutive in size. Overall it's a welcome addition to the area, the staff are great and it has a nice modern vibe."}
{"text":"I went this morning for a quick breakfast. I had high hopes for this very cute looking coffee shop. I had the matcha latte, croissant and the french toast, all of which were priced at a slight premium. 

Matcha Latte: This was one of the worst I have ever had (the worst Matcha award goes to Starbucks, if you are wondering). It was a very low quality matcha and it separated at the bottom of my cup into chunks. At ~$5, you better get my matcha fix right.

Croissant: The croissant I had was undercooked and wasn't flaky at all. This was the only croissant on the serving trey. There were two croissants at the back, which when I asked about, was told they were burnt. As I was about to leave, those two were on the serving tray by the counter. 

French Toast: They make these fresh to order, so I had high hopes as it was recommended by the staff. Unfortunately the toast took too long (~10 minutes), and the final product was very underwhelming. Soggy and tasteless french toast, for $7. 

I'm giving them two stars for the cute minimalistic clean interior and patio in an underserved area, and credit for making toast to order."}
{"text":"Campfire latte was amazing!! Kinda expensive but they use a blow torch to toast the marshmallows....so I'd say worth it. I went when it wasn't busy but I can imagine the place getting a little overcrowded at lunch time. Staff were super friendly and nice. 
Good place to go and work/study. 
Also for those instagram obsessed, very instagramable.

{"text":"Versus is a great spot for a lovely coffee. They are well known for their \"secret menu\" coloured latte art that doesn't disappoint! Ask for it if you order a flat white, cappuccino, or latte. The baristas are friendly and will guide you through the menu. 

The cafe aesthetic is a wonderful environment to enjoy your beverage. Inside, white walls with colourful artwork and plants provide the perfect Instagram back drop. Outside, the patio is welcoming with plenty of space. 

Overall, one of the must try coffee shops in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I come here for my Java fix whenever in the area. The staff is super friendly and takes pride in creating all kinds of espresso based drinks, and it shows! Delicious craft coffees with beans sourced from De Mello and yummy French toast in a chic, minimalist space. Their cortado is among the best in the city, must-try! I think that they are expanding to offer evening service as well, which would be a pleasant addition to the neighbourhood. Definitely one of my favourite coffee shops in the area!"}
{"text":"I went there for studying , great enviroment , wifi , I ordered espresso served with warm milk on side and cold water , dose of espresso just perfect brazilian beans , I stayed for 1hr then i decided to try dripped coffee and hell yea it was just perfect with taste of nuts not acidic just perfect"}
{"text":"I love me some avocado toast and boy, does this place know how to avocado toast! The avocado was perfectly ripe, the goat cheese had a great little zip to it, and the bread was fresh and crunchy while retaining that great gluten chew. With the amount of avocado you get, I also think $6.50 is a great value. A+!

Another standout is their Chai. Super flavorful and complex compared with what you usually find, even in high-quality tea and coffee shops. Def check this place out if you're a Chai-lover!

If you have time to sit while sipping, they have interesting art on the walls with a handful of tables scattered about and play really chill, relaxing (mostly French?) music.

Overall, a super cute cafe with a limited but high-quality menu and an adorable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Versus! I go there for Cortados in the morning and on the weekend I really enjoy their toasts (salmon toast and avocado toasts are my favorite). It's also one of the only coffee shops with a really nice big patio. The decor of Versus is very unique, it's modern but cozy."}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated. I liked the simplistic, white colour scheme and the menu written on the wall. I wanted to come and try versus because i saw that they made colourful latte art.. but when i ordered it and got my latte, it wasn't colourful! It wasn't until later that i read on here that you have to request it and pay extra.. it wasn't even on the menu, or else i would have tried it!

The latte itself was pretty good, but nothing that special. My partner got an affogato, and that was pretty good too, although i think it'd be hard to screw up ice cream with a shot of espresso. The prices here were steep though, and i don't think the coffee was good enough to justify it."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great location in a totally underserved area when it comes to indie 3d wave coffees. They also serve made on house foods and have beautiful outdoor patio and clean and modern minimalistic interior designs. Totally worth the visit and don't be surprised if it becomes part of your daily ritual!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee shop around queen/church neighbourhood. Highly recommend: latte, Americano, fresh coffee brew and croissant. They do colourful latte art and serve freshly baked croissants, Portuguese egg tarts, brownies and various delicious pastries daily. During the day time, this cafe has great natural lighting to do work!"}
{"text":"Not only was it the prettiest latte I've ever had (their foam art is next level!) but also very tasty. The place is very beautiful and mellow but quite small so you have to hope for some luck to grab a spot. Most people are there on their own working on their laptops so if you want a place to chat with a friend maybe it's best to look for a less quiet place. All in all, I would definitely recommend it though!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their mocha today. It was strong and smooth, just the way I like my coffee. My sister had the beetroot latte and she said it had a sweet pleasant taste. My friend has an iced chai latte which she said she preferred starbucks chai latte better. This is a cute and small cafe. The baristas are very friendly and happy."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing coffee. Really beautiful atmosphere and delicious lattes and cappuccinos. Friendly and helpful staff. Favorite coffee shop in Toronto."}
{"text":"Coffee and food is okay here. The caf√© is brightly lit and cozy. 

But I much prefer going to XO Bisous up the street."}
{"text":"By far my favourite coffee place to go to. The place is very aesthetic with a very relaxing atmosphere. Really enjoyed how everything looked (very white with accents around). It's a great place to hangout with a friend or get some work done. Walking in, all the seats were filled except for a little area when you go up the stairs. Bought myself a flat white which I really enjoyed. Definitely a place I'll find myself going back to a lot."}
{"text":"Cute place for coffee, date, Work meetup. Super accommodating staff. The hot chocolate is rich in flavour and good size. They also have rainbow lattes- very insta worthy. The cafe is quite small though so it can be hard to find a quiet spot. Hopefully it will be better in the summer when the patio is open."}
{"text":"Dropped by recently, to catch a cup of coffee with a friend since we were both in the hood.   

The place has a little bit of that Apple Store, white aesthetic but it not so strongly or as in your face as The White Squirrel or The Scullery. The place is inviting and very clean looking, if a tad on the small side. Don't be surprised if it proves impossible to find any seating, especially during the daily rushes. Keep in mind there is no second door, so this place is bound to get colder as the front door has full access to the inner venue and it is close enough to some customers that those closest might feel pretty chilly over time. 

If you live/work in the hood definitely check it out. However I found the coffee to be acceptable, I mean, not good not bad, just coffee. I definitely had way worse. 

I do think the location must look and feel a lot more inviting during the summer months due to the patio that is unfortunately already put away, due to the colder weather.

Might drop by sometime when it gets warmer."}
{"text":"FYI 1.99 drink special (campfire latte or cappuccino) if you order through Ritual app. 

I had fairly high hopes for this place as I've seen it on a few IG feeds as well as BlogTO when it first opened. The decor is wooden minimalist and it has excellent natural lighting if you want to work there for a bit. Pricing is fairly consistent with Starbucks and most financial district independents. 

However, I found that the Cortado I ordered tasted quite bitter, and not the good kind (more like cough syrup...). My bf's campfire latte also tasted this way once the marshmallows were all consumed. 

I can't quite diagnose whether it's the milk or the espresso or the way it was pulled in the machine but there are many other places within a block or two I can rely on for consistent taste. I don't believe I will return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I really enjoy the coffee  and especially appreciate the friendly staff. Sometimes these types of espresso bars can be really hipster and pretentious, not here! They opened fairly recently and every time I go back they have expanded their menu. I've tried the pecan bars and the brownies and they were both delicious. My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of the Nutella banana toast. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The staff here were soooo nice! 
The latte (I had vanilla) was really well done, it was a little on the cool side, temperature-wise, but I didn't mind because it was a VERY hot day. You can ask for it to be coloured and they will add so many pretty colours and have a beauuutiful design (mine was an awesome swan, my friend's was a rose). The two gentlemen working said that my friend and I could take a seat and they would bring our drinks over to us, so that was really cool :). 
The space has a few seats, it seems mainly intended for quick takeout or just take a quick seat while you enjoy your food/beverages, not really for a long-term stay, but that was cool. They also had a cute patio out front. 
They had some cookies and treats on the counter as well, but we were heading to grab some food later so we bypassed those on this trip. I can't wait to come back and get another pretty latte and maybe a treat!"}
{"text":"I've been to this super cute cafe twice and I had phenomenal service both times! The people who work here are so lovely and kind. It looks like a small space but I've always been able to get a seat. My friend and I ordered the coloured lattes that Versus is famous for, and they were great (but like any coloured drinks, they may temporarily turn your lips a funny colour)."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a friend and we both needed a caffeine kick. For extra money you can ask them for colourful latte art. The caramel latte was so good till the last sip! Highly recommend getting this. I also had a sip of my friend's matcha latte..we both thought it wasn't the greatest. I would skip it and focus on their latte instead."}
{"text":"Very stylish and minimalistic. Lots of natural lighting and white space, including an outdoor patio - perfect for IG opps. I wish I ordered a latte with the colourful latte art because I wanted iced chai latte instead :( (it was a humid day). Oh well, next time!"}
{"text":"Very cute coffee place to hang out with come friends. Got the versus tiramisu which was pretty good. The prices I'd say to be okay, could be cheaper but still good."}
{"text":"This cafe is so cute. It has a nice vibe that makes it a good atmosphere for just chatting with friends or just studying. They are known for their colourful latte art. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I love Versus Coffee!! Relatively close to my office, I came here on a few occasions already and recommended a few friends to come too!  What I love the most is their colour latte art which is a few cents extra (i think 50 cents?), but trust me, it is worth it! 

The lattes and flat whites I had were decent, but I would prefer a slightly stronger coffee taste.  Beside that, this coffee spot gives you a nice cozy place to sit in and chat up with friends, great latte arts for an Instagram post and super friendly staff!

A little hint, make sure you clean your lips and teeth thoroughly to ensure there are no residual colours on them.  Apparently I had green teeth for 2 hours and I didn't know."}
{"text":"Simple, Clean and Colourful - this place is far from regular. A great place to sit and get creative! They also show off some great local art . Their latte art is very creative but it is an additional cost of you want to add colour.  Nonetheless, a must visit in Toronto!"}
{"text":"These lovelies are simply killin' it. Relaxed atmosphere, friendly baristas, and creativity to boot."}
{"text":"The food was alright something I could easily make at home. But the the latte art blew it away. Latte art was so pretty !"}
{"text":"Coffee is solid here. Got a latte which was perfectly smooth, and milk was not too overwhelming. Comes with a perfect pour and latte art, clearly well practiced and effortless. 

Only 3 stars because they're currently training someone new, who doesn't know the menu (e.g. no idea about what is the campfire latte aka one of their signature drinks) and makes lots of mistakes (e.g. drinks have to be re-made because the cups weren't marked properly). This was strange to me because I'm expecting some competence for the price. Maybe they should get someone who's had experience at other coffee shops or can shadow someone first (instead of being left to her own devices). I'm sure it'll get better but with so many other options nearby, I'd wait a while before coming back."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. I went because the latte art caught my attention. I paid extra and received a green blob in return. Not worth"}
{"text":"A little bit on the pricey side for coffee, but in my opinion, it's worth it.  It's quite small inside, but they use the room wisely and there are lots of places to sit.  I came here mid-week in the afternoon and it was full.  Fortunately, we were taking out coffees to go.  A lot more people came in while we were waiting.

I tried the Campfire Latte.  It was amazing!  Cute combination of flavours, and a lot more that I want to try in the future.  Their food looks delicious as well.  Fresh, homemade and fairly healthy.  

As I've walked by again, I see that they have a large patio.  I can't wait to come here for lunch, or a coffee and some people watching."}
{"text":"I tried their cortado, which was smooth and strong! They have a good variety of espresso and tea, with some beans and tea available for purchase (genuinetea). Their croissants are freshly baked in house, and they have a morning special of a croissant and drip for around $4-5. They also have a simple menu with some breakfast and lunch items (chia seed pudding, toasts, and sandwiches on fresh baguettes). 

Nice place to work with WiFi, outdoor seating facing Adelaide, natural light, and a decent number of seating with small tables."}
{"text":"Versus Coffee is one of my favourite cafes in the financial district. The space here is not huge but just enough with patios outside. They offer really creative lattes that are \"gramworthy\" but some people might find it  a little pricey because they taste like regular lattes. I would recommend Versus Coffee to those looking for some space with good vibes to study in or catch up with friends/colleagues over coffee. I'll be coming back to try some of their pastries!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place a couple of times, and to me, it's pretty average. Located just diagonal to Terroni on Adelaide (east of Yonge St. and Adelaide St. E), and just a couple doors down from XO Bisous, I visited early on a weekday morning and found it semi-busy, but not so much that the lineup was intimidating.

I ordered a regular coffee and found it just okay. It tasted pretty basic, and didn't stand out to me as a truly excellent brew. It didn't have over roasted notes (thankfully), but it also lacked a certain boldness that would have made it memorable. Overall, average coffee.

However, what this place has going for it is its space. Very minimal, very clean and sleek. There are tables to do work, with big windows and natural light. It's a good spot to sit for a coffee date, do some reading or some work. 

I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back here just specifically for another cup of coffee, but I'd consider coming in to enjoy the space if I'm in the area (although they do have some stiff competition with XO Bisous next door, which, personally, I prefer)."}
{"text":"Super cute cafe! The space is not that big but has really good lighting to study in or chat (if u can find a spot). If you order any of the milk-based drinks (cappuccino or latte), the baristas will make the drinks colourful! I got the cappuccino and my friend got the latte, and knowing that we both want to take a photo of our drinks, the barista made the drinks in two different colours. So cute. The interior of he cafe also has cute decorations (very vibrant paintings), which match the cafe drinks. I would definitely come here again when I visit Toronto another time!"}
{"text":"Beautiful vibe & solid layout...and ofcourse great coffee. It's a nice cozy place to get some work done."}
{"text":"Excellent third-wave coffee in a beautiful, bright, modern space. I thought my latte was at least as good as what I've had at places like Sam James, Lit, Te Aro, etc. Fahrenheit, just a few blocks away, is still my favourite but Versus is a worthy contender. Unlike many caf√©s I've tried in Toronto that steam most of the flavour out of their milk, Versus had the temperature just right. 5/5 would drink again."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed walking into Versus was how aesthetically pleasing it is- would definitely be a great spot to grab coffee and get some work done as it is also pretty quiet inside. 
I came here on a Sunday morning and there were a couple empty spots to sit, but it is definitely a small space so be aware of that. There's also some outdoor seating for when it's nice out, which is nice! The staff were very friendly and the service was fast. 

As for my order, I got one of the colourful lattes (you have to ask for this) and a chocolate croissant. The croissant was flakey and yum, but they're not covered so I can imagine it getting stale pretty quickly into the day. 
The latte was good, and obviously very pretty, but one star off because it was just warm and not hot, which is my biggest coffee pet peeve."}
{"text":"Among the best coffee shops in downtown Toronto. The space is small, but ample if you can sit outside. Not a huge menu other than coffee and tea (and beer!) but the \"Dancing Goats\" De Mello brew is absolutely stellar. Ask for strong coffee and you'll get a satisfying cup, otherwise the general Canadian palate is quite mild as in everything."}
{"text":"A very cute, quaint place. Its aesthetic and the baristas are very friendly. If you tell them you're there for Instagram, they'll make your drink prettier :) Pro tip, anything on the counter or in the glass dome is available for purchase. I was corrected when asking whether the croissants were just on display.

The food itself is decent. A lot of avocado, but fair for its price. The lattes are not very sweet or bitter. The atmosphere is quiet and work oriented, people definitely come to work in this place. I would recommend it if you're looking for a chic cafe to do some light work and drink some novelty lattes."}
{"text":"Good coffee, a little bit pricier than other places in the area. 

There's good seating area outside with umbrella shades to shield you from the sun. Ambience is nice inside as well, bright and lively. But I see this maybe becoming a problem in the winter since there's not a lot of room inside to sit, or at least I didn't notice right away.

BTW, cool idea to have the menu and prices on the wall ... or is that the foundation of the building!

I had the Cortado and I like how they serve it on a small clear glass as supposed to the ceramic/china coffee cup kind. I might sound like a snob, but I find Cortado tastes better in the clear glass and filled up to the brim. Much like a shot of espresso is better served on a small espresso cup. You get the idea :)

Anyway, I'll probably come back and try the other coffee and food in the menu."}
{"text":"Versus has their menu written on the wall, with a beautiful and (extremely) hipster decor.   Agreed with Alice H., we ordered the latte and it was good, but there are just way too many amazing coffee shops in downtown for Versus to stand out. 

Also tried their egg tarts - it was almost hard to bite into the shell. Not sure if it was the style (?) of the tarts but it did not taste freshly made.

Everyone working in the store seemed to be doing their own thing during a Sunday afternoon even though there were no other customers! Organzing the chairs, walking around away from the front desk, etc.."}
{"text":"Decent coffee, but would not say its amazing or special. They try to make \"special\" lattes such as the campfire or caramel lattes, but I usually like the typical espresso based coffee drinks from normal 3rd wave shops. I don't care for marshmallows in my coffee, I just want to taste the coffee. Prices similar to 3rd wave shops, but would say not worth it. 

Staff are friendly and the space is very nice to enjoy your coffee. There is a nook in the back where you can have a semi-private convo."}
{"text":"Wowzers! Came here for a light breakfast of croissant and drip coffee was pleasantly surprised...

Started smiling profusely as I was chewing the plain croissant and downing the drip coffee..for a moment went away to Paris...nothing like a meal which transcends you to a part of your brain where happy thoughts live!

Great atmosphere, boho-chic decor, great patio...great drinks...they also have a lot of alcoholic beverages on the menu as well..

Chic. Drop the Mike (-;"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time.  It's a really nice coffee shop with a beautiful patio.  The seating area inside is a bit small but decor is nicely done and it was very comfortable.

I got this really \"pretty\" matcha latte...and if you check out my photo you'll know what I mean.  It was also very tasty.  My friend got just a black coffee and she said it was good as well.  Didn't get a chance to try the food so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Coffee scene in Toronto is pretty fierce and plentiful... So how do you make yourself stand out?  Lots of people can do wonderful latte art and make it Insta pretty.  There are some really good local roasters to get very good beans and make a great tasting cup.  Most people can reno and paint their way to a cute spot.  So what's the difference between a 4 and 5 star place?  The owner and baristas.  Anthony, owner of Versus, brought that forward and put Versus in one of my top spots in Toronto for me.

Sitting pretty with a patio at the base of a new(er) build condo, Versus is a cute and modern small cafe that serves up espresso based drinks and also buddha bowls and simple breakfast fares.  It's a calm atmosphere with its white washed walls and lots of bright sunlight flowing in.  On a Sunday morning, lots of locals filled the tables with their drinks and laptops.  It was nicely quiet even if every table was taken.

Quick note ... for all those who want to get your Instagram pretty drinks.  Just tell them ahead of time and for a few dimes, they can make your drink look like a rainbow.  Also they have this crazy sounding one where they use maple syrup and roasted marshmallow for their campfire latte. 

Flat white - rich, smooth, and balanced.  This was very nice and the darker notes made me appreciate it even more since a few recent places were quite light.  I liked how there wasn't too much acidity but there was a touch bitterness that gave it a pleasant bite.  It's definitely not your starter espresso drink but it's still very approachable.  5/5

Caramel Latte - I love the latte art on this one as I know almond milk doesn't froth as densely as cows milk.  The taste to this was mildly sweet with a touch of caramel.  It did balance with the lighter coffee note as it didn't overwhelm it.  Perhaps I was expecting a bolder note for both the coffee or caramel.  Either way, a nice drink to start the day. I think I'll grab the flat white next time.  4/5

As I mentioned, 5 stars are not common for me but I feel the passion from Anthony was really great.  We had an amazing conversation about the coffee scene in Toronto.  His personal take on how Toronto's taste buds are with coffee and how he specifically chosen his coffee beans to suit his clientele.  I definitely want to return and perhaps try more great drinks."}
{"text":"Love love the patio!  Not many cafes have a patio and offer a decent cold brew!  I especially love how it is served in a glass pint!

Ritual orders are welcomed!  Walk ups are given stamp cards  some extra incentive.

Although not the best coffee or menu on the block, it is definitely one of the better ambiance.  There's a little nook as you walk up a little stairway to sit quietly and read--my oasis from the bustle of work on my break 

Wifi password is 70versus 

It's not a 'bougie' cafe at all--it may look like one but it definitely isn't, staff are really really nice, I do feel bad they're always in the heat (no air con)"}
{"text":"I love this gem of a cafe. The owner and staff are extremely nice and will try their best to accommodate any requests. I've tried the Campfire Latte which is a nice treat with blow torched marshmallows on top, and a Caramel Latte with colour which was beautifully made."}
{"text":"Super friendly and the coffee is great. Had the flat white and it's 100% on point. Barista was nice but over bearing."}
{"text":"The coffee here was excellent. It was my first time trying it. Seating is a bit limited but my friend and I were able to snatch up a two seater. Everything was going well until one of the employees asked us if it was ok for us to move our seats since a party of 6 came in. Given that we were enjoying our coffee and in mid conversation, this request was a bit displeasing. We decided to leave after this."}
{"text":"Beautiful natural lighting, quirky seating spots, and beautiful rainbow lattes! 

Their lattes are gorgeous AND delicious. Ask for the rainbow latte because it's not actually on the menu! Very relaxed atmosphere and nice quiet place to do work on a sunny day :) 

There's also outdoor seating as well!"}
{"text":"Coffee is good. I had a cappuccino. Also, their vegan chilli is amazing. Not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit but good for convenience"}
{"text":"On my weekend trip to Toronto, my first order of business was to get some coffee (especially after my early-morning flight). Based on what I know about the coffee/cafe scene in Toronto, cafes and coffeeshops are working hard to distinguish themselves a quite saturated market, and finding a good coffeeshop isn't particularly difficult, but the unique differentiators are always a perk. The perks at Versus Coffee were the beautiful space, colorful drinks, and incredibly kind baristas. For someone who had to wake up at 4am to get to Versus Coffee in the first place, these perks basically made my day.

The space is small (a bit cramped if you want to do work but not horrible if you're meeting a friend or just passing through), but the decor makes the shop feel bright and open. There is a lot of natural wood, white walls, greenery, and cute lights. It's a beautiful space to spend time in, no matter how long. When I first walked up to the counter, the barista asked me if I had found them through Instagram (I did, heh). They offer colourful latte art on their plain and matcha lattes, which looked quite cute!

Between my friends and I, we had two lattes and a matcha latte. We also had a chocolate croissant, a bagel, and an avocado toast. Each of these pastries/dishes were good, and the avocado toast had a squeeze of lemon on top which gave it a fresh note.

On our way out, I dropped a water glass on the floor and spilled a bunch of water while chipping the glass. I felt so bad! But the baristas were super nice and came out to help me clean up and make sure things were okay. It was a great start to my morning (and weekend!) in Canada. I would definitely come back for a drink, a bite to eat, and a nice Instagram photo.

(Also, check out their velvet, blue algae, and turmeric lattes if you want a drink with a pop of colour!)"}
{"text":"Modern and minimalist coffee shop to get your caffeine fix. Went for the first time on Sunday. Place was not as busy as expected and there was ample seating available. The space was bright and spacious. My boyfriend and I ordered an Americano and a decaf latte. Service was friendly as the employees brought our drinks to us. I noticed they also have toasts made to order (would love to try next time!). Great place to get a cup of coffee when you're around the area!"}
