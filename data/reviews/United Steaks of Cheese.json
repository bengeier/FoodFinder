{"text":"Came to my work a few months ago.  Probably the same place as Glenn.  Waited 45 minutes for one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had period.  Burned and tasted of death.  Threw out after one bite.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Saw great things on Yelp.  Didn't quite pan out.  They came to our work place.  Got there and at least 10 people who had already ordered standing around waiting for food.    Ordered the \"Yo\".  Informed that they were out of wiz so settled on provolone.    Took 30 minutes to get one sandwich and an order of fries.  Not good.  Didn't give me the fry sauce that is advertised with the fries on the menu.  When I asked, I got a cup of sauce but no lids so did the balancing act back inside.  Got back to my desk and the fries were decent.    The sandwich was bad.  Burned meat.  That smell and taste permeated the sandwich.  Hardly any cheese...mostly lumped in the middle of the bun.  If I wasn't stuck in a meeting, I would have returned it.   Maybe they were having a bad day.  Might give them a second chance if they come around again since most of the reviews here are positive.  Just a lot of money to pay for a crappy sandwich."}
{"text":"I was expecting to get a delicious sandwich instead I got over chard/close to burnt, tasteless meat on a cold bun. So disappointed, It took them over 45 minutes to make my sandwich and the result was evident they rushed thru it and turned their grill high to finish faster. No apology for the delay and even worse they forgot the cheese on the sandwich. I will never try this again not even worth a second chance.  I still have the bitter taste in my mouth from the burnt scrapings - this was disgusting, and I am not a picky eater at all. This food truck has disappointed even those with low expectations."}
{"text":"OMG.... can't say enough about this food truck! One of the best cheesesteaks I have ever had. The man and woman working the truck were so friendly and happy to accommodate additions and changes to make my perfect sandwich. :) Very flavorful meat and loved the bread... Fries were really good too (obsessed with the fry sauce!). Thanks for stopping by our office and I can't wait for the next time you come around!!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Cheesesteak I've EVER had.  If I've said this before, then that sandwich goes in the number 2 spot behind this.   I've known Adam for years. We used to play poker together. He's a successful culinary entrepreneur now - owner of three food trucks. I recall when he took a job as the cook at one of the local places where we played poker. The menu there was like 50 pages long with hundreds of items. He later went on to gain notoriety as a chef at other local restaurants... landing himself in the paper more than a few times. He's also been on TV a few times since he decided to start his own business.   He started with Frank Food Truck, selling gourmet hot dogs. Then he built Rounders - a truck selling ice cream sandwiches. Now, he is launching United Steaks of Cheese. He's got his own little empire going now. I really haven't hung out with Adam too much since our days playing poker - before all this chef stuff. It's always great to see him though. He always seems to be wearing a smile, so at least he's doing something he loves.   Tonight, I picked up a couple of cheesesteaks from his truck - one steak wit wiz, and one chicken cheesesteak with provolone for the fiancee (of course I sampled both, duh). It was a bit of a drive for me - tonight he was out in the East valley. I love the theme of his trucks - all unique and clever. This one is no different. It's an awesome wrap. I haven't tried Rounders, and I've only had Frank food out of a trailer he brings to smaller events. This is the first time I've actually pulled food out of the window of his truck. He gave me a couple of fist bumps and a smile before I took off. I'm not gonna lie though, I tore into the bag as soon as I got back to my car and crammed a few bites into my mouth. I also had to fumble around with it - shoving it in my face at stoplights while driving home.   There wasn't much left when I did finally get home, but enough so my fiancee could have a bite. She agreed with me that it was hands-down the best we had eaten... and we've eaten cheesesteaks IN Philly from one of the most famous places and from a local's recommendation and a few other spots. I mean, DeFalco's has a great and unique cheesesteak that is one of my favorites, but USOC's is the best of the traditional authentic Philly.   The steak was perfectly seasoned. Many cheesesteak places don't even season their meat, but this was easily the most flavorful and tender cheesesteak beef I've ever had. The \"wiz\" tasted like the stuff you get in the big fancy box of deluxe mac and cheese - somehow better than wiz I've had elsewhere. It's probably the same thing. I don't know. All I know is that when I was done, I licked the paper.   I. Licked. The. Paper.  The chicken was also seasoned great. Nothing remained of either sandwich. My fiancee sort of wished I had ordered the chicken wit wiz also instead of provolone. It was good either way. But to be honest, the steak stole the show. The bread used, I'm told, was imported from Philly. There's a couple places in town that import bread from Philly, but their bread is nowhere near as soft and chewy as this. I think some of the other places around Phoenix that import bread freeze them. I don't think that's the case here. Most places use the same frozen strip steak too - which is why most cheesesteaks in the Valley taste about the same (and why they can't even touch USOC's sandwich).   USOC definitely uses premium ingredients - it's clear in each bite. One of the benefits of running a food truck is that your food costs can be a little higher than they would be at a regular brick and mortar restaurant where rent forces you to keep your food costs low. You don't rent a food truck, you buy it. This means that food trucks often provide higher quality product to restaurants at comparable price points.   My fiancee said that Adam \"hit this one out of the park.\" I have to agree.  Edit Feb 2015 - This review earned me some hate mail. He said I didn't know anything about anything, and that I was an idiot or something. He said cheesesteak meat doesn't need seasoning because it's smothered in cheeze wiz. I thanked him for his comments and we went back and forth until he private messaged me to meet somewhere to fight. I haven't had someone from the internet offer to fight me in person since the days of AOL. HAHA... oh, internet... you're so full of wondrous things.  Oh, and I ate here a second time (my gf picked us up a couple of sandwiches the day before my birthday), and it was as great as the first. I stand by my review.  Also - I do know Adam - the owner of this place - but I'm not a shill... He can go fuck himself right in the ear. See?"}
{"text":"These cheese steaks are the things that dreams are made of. I work for a New Jersey based company and my dad is from Philly, so between work and family I spend a lot of time on the east coast- and have had my share of cheese steaks. If I had a Gino's, Pat's and USOC sandwich in front of me all at once, I'd go for United Steaks of Cheese every time. Not kidding.   The beef is really tender, and I've yet to get any gristle. Out of three sandwiches I've had there, I've opted for chicken twice (not normally a big beef fan) and those are also amazing. I will admit, there's something magical about a cheese steak with cheese wiz though. Yesterday I tried one of their special sandwiches- the Tsunami which was chicken, broccoli and yellow squash with teriyaki sauce and it was fantastic.   Everyone is always friendly, and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. My only wish was that they were a little more clear on their facebook or twitter on where they are in real time so I don't have to hunt them down so hard when the mood strikes. Dreaming of my next sandwich already :D"}
