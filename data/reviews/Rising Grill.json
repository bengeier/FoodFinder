{"text":"Yum! Stopped by for lunch. 
I had the dol sot bi bim bap. 
Delicious! Veggies were fresh, rice was crispy on the bottom, portion of beef was decent. My husband had the bul go gi and he was happy with it. Good selection of fresh banchan and I was glad to see the inclusion of the anchovies. A lovely ginger and cinnamon drink with pine nuts was provided to aid digestion at the end of the meal.
Not the cheapest Korean lunch I've ever had, but the quality was worth the money.
I'm looking forward to visiting again to try the BBQ for a dinner.
Fingers crossed this place lasts longer than the former place!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by since we wanted to try the new korean bbq and were super impressed!  
-Our food came with 11 bon chon that were freshly made  by the owner.  More than any other korean restaurant!  Also it was all super tasty and fresh.
- Our bbq (we got the duck and prime kal bi)was flavorful, came with lettuce, onions, pickled lotus, onions, jalapenos, garlic, and two sauces.  They also cooked the meat for us over a gas grill (most korean bbqs use electric grill)
-we also got the korean fried chicken (kang pungi) and it was lightly battered very flavorful and all white meat. 
-very attentive and friendly service 
-they have us a complimentary dessert soup that my husband says tastes like christmas!
Overall this was a wonderful experience, it was not cheap but you definitely got your money's worth!  We will be returning."}
{"text":"*Update: I visited again for BBQ, and omg it was even better! We ordered the Combo #2, which was more than enough for 5 people. The meat was fresh, tender, and competitively priced. I suggest ordering the spicy pork - the flavor was incredible without an overwhelming spice and it melts in your mouth the way bbq should. We also ordered duck on the side, which totally surprised all of us!! We all had chinese Duck, but never duck in kbbq. It changed our lives, however, and it should change yours as well - we all recommend it. 

Rising grill also provides more barbecue essentials than other korean bbq in Cleveland, including ssam and radish wraps. 

The service again was wonderful - quick, attentive, and SO nice. We had a group of five which was larger than the table could accommodate, but we felt very well taken care of. Again, a 10/10 experience!"}
{"text":"A new restaurant I think it is better than the korean house restaurant if you wanna try the Korean food"}
{"text":"First!  Yessssss... I never get to be first on Yelp!  Rising from the ashes of the former Seoul Hot Pot restaurant, comes Rising Grill, the newcomer on the Cleveland Korean food scene.  Honestly it looks the same inside than it did when it was SHP.  New owner/chef.  So I'm going to compare it to Seoul Garden in Parma, which is for my money the best Korean food in Cleveland. 

Neither place is going to win any awards for decor and atmosphere, let's be honest, but how is the food?  Pretty good, I'd say.

Our waitress was very friendly and welcoming.  She was patient as we went through the menu.  Pretty classic Korean fare.  We got galbi (kalbi), pork belly on the grill, dolsop bibimbip, fried chicken wings, and a cold buckwheat noodle dish.  The kalbi was a little more pricey than at SG, and my wife liked SG's a little better.  I though they are both delicious but I'm not sure why there is a 50% price premium on this version.  We liked the pork belly- crispy, salty with the dipping sauce and with a tasty chew.  It wasn't a bad deal.  Bimbimbop was heavy on the toppings, with a little less rice, which can be good or bad.  Honestly it is about the same as the other places that we've been.

Some in our party loved the chicken wings.  They were perfectly cooked and golden brown and delicious. I thought the sauce reminded me a little bit too much like sweet and sour sauce.  Cold buckwheat noodles were ok- they forgot to cut our noodles to make them easier to eat.  They were ok, there is another cold buckwheat noodle dish at SG that I like better.

Bonchon, the complimentary appetizers that come with your food were ok. They gave a small bowl of stew which was surprising, I haven't gotten one of those before, but I missed some classics like the potato dish, fish cakes, little sticky soy beans etc. 

Lastly, I was a little bummed that they didn't have those wonderful little yogurt drinks at the end of the meal, and they also didn't give us any fruit and they gave some other guests some watermelon which left my daughter a miffed.  Petty perhaps, but it is a more pricey experience than Seoul Garden and so I expect it at the very least to be able to match what they offer.

Overall it was pretty good, but at $121 for 4 adults and one child before tip it wasn't cheap.  But for a special night out, I'd come back.  SG still reigns Supreme in my Cleveland Korean rankings though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with my out of town family and was very impressed!  The server was amazingly helpful and gave us a great overview of the menu and helped us pick out a combo which would work best for our group.  

We got the dumplings and a kimchi pancake for appetizer and loved them both.

For dinner, we got a Chef showcase combination BBQ with beef, marinated pork and chicken.  All the meat was delicious.   The meal came with a wide selection of sides and 2 soups which were all very good.

All in all, we got a great meal, the server was incredibly responsive.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Korean place in town!!! 

I love their seafood pancake and rice bowl and if course grill. The owner is so nice . This little place makes me feel I am in Korean. I will say don't miss it and visit"}
{"text":"My hub and me have living in South Korean long time ago. This is definitely the best korean restaurant in town. We feel so luck to try it!!! Too delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like a lot from the outside but friendly staff and delicious meats (we had the marinated rib eye and pork!) make this a real find! Some many side dishes to add to your meats with more available on request. There was hardly any room on the table!The Kim chi was spot on! Ended with a sweet tasty drink to aid digestion. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had the bul go gi and some pork. We had 15 or more side dishes and they were all really tasty. Very well spiced as well. The service was spectacular and very helpful. We felt right at home."}
{"text":"Most wholesome banchan in Cle!

Definitely recommend the sullung tang if you're craving something warm and homey! Give the broth a dash of salt and let the aromas grow on you."}
{"text":"The owners are really nice, but they are really short handed, my friends and I went there and we waited for 15-20mins just for the water....another 10-15mins for the food to come out. When the food finally arrived we discovered that the jajangmyeon was tasteless, as were most of the side dishes. I have visited plenty of Korean bbq/restaurants but they are up to par. I hope they improve on their sauces and wait times."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner. Omg, this restaurant is amazing. They offered a lot of side dishes and all of them tasted good. And I ordered the BBQ beef and the meat is a \"wow\". Definitely, we will come back for that."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! We were excited to try this restaurant which opened earlier this month, and it blew us away!! There are several shareable grill items on the menu, shareable hot pots, as well as a large selection of individual meal items. We grilled our meat on a grill right in the middle of our table, and everything was crave-worthy. Fabulous place to come with a bunch of friends to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Long time Yelp user, first time poster.  After only the second visit, I can say that this is easily the best Korean restaurant in Cleveland.  There is finally an equivalent to the best ones I have visited in L.A. and Las Vegas.  However, unlike some of the Las Vegas ones, it is fortunately traditional and not Americanized.  Even better than the old Seoul Hot Pot.

Banchan is the best quality I have ever had, and the most plentiful.  They served dried anchovies - a favorite of mine that I haven't had at a restaurant since Seoul Hot Pot.  Unlike a lot of places, there isn't a gross half inch of water in the steamed egg.  There were also some new things that I have never had in any of the two dozen plus Korean restaurants I have been to.  

The first visit I had the duck BBQ.  Never have seen that on a menu.  It is deliciously fatty, similar to Samgyeopsal (pork belly).  Highly recommended.  I was pleasantly surprised when they brought a portable grill to my table.  That usually requires a minimum of two orders in most places.

The second visit I had my favorite soup, Yukgaejang.  It was the best version I have ever had.  The things many restaurants miss on this dish are that the beef tastes dried out and there isn't enough beef flavor in the broth.  The chef at Rising Grill nailed it.  Perfect.

The chef/owner and the wait staff are more genuinely interested in how I'm enjoying the meal than any restaurant I have ever been to.  Service at Korean restaurants can be a bit impersonal, but the staff at Rising Grill are super friendly!  I think that there is a lot of personal pride in how well they execute and they sincerely enjoy seeing happy customers.

It is a little more expensive, but you are getting it back with much higher food quality than other options in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. I believe the owner was the one in the front who seated me. She was super nice and so was the man who brought out the food (the cook?). I got the dolsot bibimbap and it was great. Definitively hit the spot... though in all fairness, I had been craving some bibimbap for a while. It was served with a plethora of banchan sides, which also were delicious. Will definitely need to stop back to try the meats sometime.

Best wishes to this restaurant and owner - would definitely recommend everyone to go and try!"}
{"text":"This was a great Korean restaurant!  The food was delicious (although a bit sweeter than I'm used to having). The couple was very kind and the soju made it perfect."}
{"text":"I would give a negative 5 stars if that was allowed. The food didn't taste bad, it simply had no taste to it... Korean is one of my go to food all of my life. I've had Korean food in a lot of different cities in the states, and different countries. This place has made it to #1 the WORST Korean restaurant. And I can't even think of another place that's even close to this level of bad. The service was super slow, and place was half empty... like after you sit down you have to ask for water and to order food, and it still takes 20mins to get you water level of slow... I assume the lady out front is the owner, she's very nice. But I just never had so tasteless bbq beef & noodles before. After spending $74 dollars here on tasteless food, my friends and I had to go to another restaurant cause we couldn't finish the tasteless food......"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, beautiful, and oh so good. Is this the only Korean bbq in town with a gas grill? It really makes the experience, along with the banchan and the sweetest owners ever. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Ah the plight of 3709 Payne Avenue... it's been through at least 3 owners in as many years, and has been in desperate need of some TLC. The shabby looking interior has been freshened up with a coat of paint, and more importantly, owners with a desire to satisfy the Korean BBQ lovers of Cleveland. I came here on a Friday night with a group of friends, and wasn't surprised to see that the BBQ section of the restaurant was jam-packed. In typical Korean restaurant fashion, there was one woman manning the front acting as both hostess and server. She did a great job making us feel welcome though, and we didn't have to wait long until one of the tables opened up and they quickly bussed it for us. The tables are a bit crammed in the front of the restaurant, but let us not neglect to be grateful that Rising Grill has ACTUAL built-in gas grills, rather than the portable ones the other Korean restaurants in Cleveland have. 

When it came time for us to order, our server explained that the BBQ menu at least is priced per person. At around $20-$30 per entree, this place is not at all cheap. However, they claim that they use high quality ingredients and increase the number and quality of the banchan so that customers get their money's worth. When she brought out the banchan, we saw exactly what she meant. Since we ordered a combination option (there are three combinations priced between $75 and $120 which can be split between 3-4 people) we received at least 15 different banchan. We received the standard fare such as kimchi and mu, but also some things that we did not expect at all, like a whole dolsot full of seafood soondubu jjigae, and whole fried yellow croaker. There were also a lot of banchan that some of us hadn't even tried before, and the server informed us this is largely due to the fact that their chef, who has been trained in Korean cuisine, often includes different banchan every day based on what inspires him, or what ingredients are available. I was incredibly impressed by the quality of even the simplest of banchans, such as the steamed egg, or gyeran-jjim and the pan fried anchovies, which were bursting with flavor. Our group also was in love with the soondubu jiggae, which again, was packed with plump seafood and flavor in the broth. As for the BBQ itself, our combination (#53) included samgyupsal (pork belly), chadol baegi (thinly sliced beef brisket) and  jaeyuk (spicy marinated pork) and we received generous portions of each. Our group was impressed with the quality of the meat, and we felt more than satisfied with the portions we received as complimented by the banchan. 

After dinner, we were so pleased when our server brought out sujeonggwa, a fragrant and chai-like beverage that is made with cinnamon and ginger. Way better than the yogurts in my opinion and it was nice to try something that I hadn't tried before. 

It's also worthy to mention that they had a decent variety of beverages. They didn't have Hite beer, but they did have Cass, as well as a good quality soju and even specialty drinks like ginseng liquor. We did have a few issues flagging down our server more than once, but this is the plight of restaurants like these, and we saw it had more to do with the number of tables needing service and the single server who was taking on many jobs than with any sort of apathy as had been the case with the previous owners. The service we did receive was hospitable and friendly, welcoming us to have a good time at the restaurant without appearing overeager. I left feeling like I had a really top-notch meal and felt content that we finally have a decent Korean BBQ restaurant in Cleveland. Here's hoping they can keep up the quality and we have them in this space for a while. I think this is a great spot to bring a group to have some BBQ, but I'm also eager to return to try their lunch specials. 

TL;DR although it's not the cheapest of options for Korean in Cleveland, Rising Grill is a can't miss for Korean BBQ with a lot of unique and inspired dishes. Banchan is not an afterthought here, but rather dishes with complex and homestyle flavor that increase the overall experience. A bit understaffed, but not short on hospitality."}
