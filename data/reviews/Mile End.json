{"text":"Les entrées sont bonnes : on a testé sardine et pieuvre grillées. Mais le poulet est très décevant! Bien grillé mais sans plus... Fade! Les frites ne sont pas bonnes et la salade qui accompagne le repas est servie avant l'entrée..."}
{"text":"We stopped here with a few folks from work and grabbed a quick lunch. The staff was good and the food was tasty.

I had the chorizo sandwich and was pretty happy with it. The french fries were good too."}
{"text":"Montreal has so many great restaurants but we like coming here for one simple reason, great food. 

Whenever we are in Montreal we always make the effort to eat at Rotisserie Mile End because the food is always fresh and you never leave there feeling like you didn't eat enough. 

I personally love their calamari dish and the grilled sardines, but quite often I order their open flame grilled chicken with either fries or their home made roasted potatoes. 

You get Portuguese bread and salad with your meal. They have a small but very yummy selection of Portuguese pastries, like the traditional natas. 

If you want an affordable but yummy meal then you have to pop in and eat there. The owners Nelson and Grace are usually there and they will make your visit a very welcoming one."}
{"text":"Location: On St. Viateur, west of the main. Off the top of my head, the closest subway is probably Laurier (check the map) - street parking available, but metered. Watch out for those residential zones.

The place: Tiny. Get there early or make a reservation. In terms of its overall look and feel, the rotisserie is average and nothing to write home about.

The food: My personal opinion is that Mile End is mediocre. I wasn't blown away by the chicken - I found it a little tough and there wasn't any moistness to it. In terms of flavour, meh - nothing special. There was nothing that stood out or made my taste buds quiver with excitement. Instead of fries, I had the rice (I know, who does that?). Wow. The rice was white - that's it, that's all. No veggies, no chicken broth and zero flavour. Would not repeat that experience. The bread and salad that are great though. The salad was fresh and crispy and the bread was soft and tasty.

Service: Average to mediocre. When we asked if we could sit at another table (this was before we even sat down at the original table), the waiter gave my friend this look then literally threw the menus onto the new table. Really buddy? The table was right behind you - it's not like you had to walk a mile to reach it. This same waiter proceed to rub his arse against my chair all night, which wasn't annoying at all.  Service is also very slow. 

Price point: I think a breast and side is about $12."}
{"text":"Walking up and down St. Viateur during vacation I saw this place with tons of people on the patio and good smells coming out of the front door.  Plus the sign out side said grilled sardines!  And lets just say good grilled sardines can be hard to fine in the states, so that put the nail in and we decided to go one night.  IT was raining that day, so no patio, but service inside was good.  Started with the house red as well as I know very little about Portuguese wine and figure this would be a good way to start trying them, and it was good and very reasonably priced.  WE got the sardines of course, they were nicely done and tasty.  Fairly typical to my mind for the dish, but very happy to gave them.  

We also tried the chicken and lamb combo.  Figured that way would get a few tastes of things.  The lamb was cooked nicely, tender and properly seasoned.  A real winner.  I thought the chicken was very good.  Other reviewers have complained about the chicken here, but mine was moist and had a good flavor.  From reading I know there is a real cult of Portuguese chicken going on with people's favorites and such, so I can't really compare to any place else, but standing on its own I thought it was very good.  

But know what the real secret here is?  The pepper sauce.  That thing is amazing!  Great flavor and a dab on either the meats or the potatoes gave things a nice smokiness.  That sauce is money in a jar!  If I thought I could get it through customs I would have gotten a jar as they do sell it separately to go here!  Heck at the very least stop in and grab a jar to try at home."}
{"text":"Killer flan. Chicken isn't bad. Great service and friendly staff. Good lunch hangout."}
{"text":"Superb grilled chicken - amazingly crispy skin, excellent with rice or chips. The salad and peri-peri sauce are both great as well. We've eaten at a few different Portuguese places in Montreal and this stands out as a fave. Service can be a little slow, but the food is worth the wait. Really nice on the terrace in the summertime too."}
{"text":"La présentation des assiettes manque de couleur.  Poulet et frites=beige. La salade est servie avant. 
Le service est bon. 
Pas de bon choix de dessert."}
{"text":"Probably the best meal we have had in Montreal.  Local, low music, easy conversation, grilled sardines, and two lamb chops on top of octopus please.  super nice and relaxed service, a few glasses of vino oh and half a chicken with that awesome sauce.  thank you!  all for $77 a bargain and in a quiet local neighborhood"}
{"text":"Rotisserie Mile End, where to start. I had a whole chicken portuguese style, it was tasty but dry. Overall good, but had better at Romados.

Had an entree of calamari and what a surprise, paid 6$+ for one tiny piece. I noticed when I got home, because I took it for takeout. 

Will not go back, 28$ for a chicken and a tiny calamari. I get better value and quality at Romados or even St-hubert chicken."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the urban noisy terrasse , the service and the food, nice decoration and clean toilet."}
