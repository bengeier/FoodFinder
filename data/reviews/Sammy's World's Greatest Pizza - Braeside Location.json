{"text":"Always good.  We usually pick up because delivery takes a long time, just because they are so busy.   4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with this place, we order from here often. Their donair pizza is my favorite, and my hubby's favorite is the vegetarian nightmare.  Thee best pizza ever! Cash only with delivery tho unfortunately."}
{"text":"We've recently moved into the neighborhood,  and friends recommended this place. They have delicious pizza, many different varieties. I always prefer to pick up so I know it will be hot when I get it home rather than have it delivered. I've had their ceasar salad once and their menu states the dressing is homemade. It was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is done a million different ways by a million different people. Sammy's does it the way I like it: perfectly crunchy crust, perfectly sumptuous toppings, and perfectly toasted cheese on top. Ordered for delivery and the pie was steaming hot. Will order there again.  I had the Vegetarians Nightmare for $24 it was massive."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I have had since leaving Montreal. They make the pizzas right. The donairs are to die for (always ask for extra sauce!!!  It is amazing). The staff are friendly and will always take a few seconds to chat with the customers while they wait."}
{"text":"Just order it.   The pizza never fails to deliver. High quality and great taste.  Meats lovers can rejoice with a Vegetarian's nightmare pie.    You can actually order less - medium instead of large - as the pizza is so filling."}
{"text":"This has been our family favorite since the 90's. We've tried others, but miss Sammy's when we do. Nicely  grilled cheese on top, crunchy crust. The donairs are really amazing too. Delivery is slow..takes over an hour. Pizza is usually always still very warm upon arrival. The donairs need a quick micro zap I find..but so good. Pizza is better then the Olive Grove, but simular. Give it a try...its really worth it."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood pizza place. I get pizza and wings - both are delicious! I always order before I leave work and by the time I get there it's ready to go. Reasonably priced for a quality product.  Only complaint is sometimes no matter how many times I call, I just get a busy signal. 4 stars because of this. Can't be a customer if I can't even order."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Calgary!!!! Highly recommend if you are a Chicago deep dish fan!!!"}
{"text":"Only three stars, their quality has diminished since they moved locations. Their pizza used to be five stars when they were in Cedarbrae but I think their new ovens just aren't producing the same crust they used to have."}
