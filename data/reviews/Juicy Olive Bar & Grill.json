{"text":"I found this place on MenuPalace website under TopTen restaurants. Its actually number one restaurant and had pretty good reviews so we decided to try. There was 6 of us on Friday night and we didn't make a reservation which was a mistake because the place was pretty full and they didn't have table for 6. We were offered to sit at the bar until something become available and we did. The bartender was very nice, she made the best Litchi martini i ever tried. She took our appetizer order while we were waiting (about 20min) so when we got the table we didn't have to wait for the food which was great because we were starving. All six of us agreed that the food was amazing, as well as the presentation. Besides a big menu choices they had quite a lot specials to offer. I ordered seafood pasta in the spicy tomato ssauce - sooo good. My girlfriend had rib steak it was soft as butter and full of flavour.  We had such a good time that we left the place after midnight.   Great place for Friday or Saturday dinner!!!  We will be back for sure! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"First visit .....will definitely not be our last.!  Start to finish everything was great.  Antipasti platter, surf and turf seafood platter even the pizza , superb.Chris, our server was informative,professional and very nice!     We went without reservations only because of the  holidays but I would imagine this little gem is a hotspot and reservations would be a god idea."}
{"text":"Great well-crafted food. Flawless meal, from appetizers to cocktails to main dish! Great Service, although we were there on a Sunday night with few tables filled. Very friendly staff too!"}
