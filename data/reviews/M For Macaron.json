{"text":"Move over, cupcakes, macarons are the newest trendy dessert on the block and for good reason. The beautiful little French sandwich cookies (not to be confused with coconut macaroons) seem to be popping up all over Calgary, which I guess only makes sense since Calgary offers the perfect arid climate in which to make these notoriously humidity sensitive, finicky-to-make treats.

M for Macarons offers up the best macarons in Calgary. Their cute little outpost in the Calgary Farmers Market is so charming that you could easily forget all about the organic veggies you stopped in for while debating between salty caramel, chocolate peppermint, or red velvet macarons. M's are the closest ones you'll find to those produced by the great Parisian macaron meccas like Laduree or Pierre Herme, very authentic and so beautiful to look at with their delicate coloring and smooth surfaces (poke around the Farmers Market- you'll find other places offering them up and you'll definitely see the difference.) The difference between M's and their Parisian cousins? M has tons more innovative flavors. Sure, you can get your traditional French favorites like vanilla, hazelnut, or raspberry from M and you won't be disappointed at all. But M's goal is to produce more than 100 different flavors this year, including daring combinations like Key lime and chili, or pink grapefruit, and you're going to have a hard time choosing :)

M sells nothing but macarons- you won't find any other breads or pastries or cookies at their stand. And their single-minded dedication to these delicious, luxurious mouthfuls certainly pays off when you taste one. At $2 a pop, they're an indulgence with a Parisian price tag and you probably won't be chomping on these by the handful. But part of the fun is standing before their case pondering the rainbow of lovely cookies and picking out the one (or maybe two!) that is most tempting that week."}
{"text":"The best macarons that I have tasted, including Thomas Haas in Vancouver.

These light, sweet, crunchy while slightly chewy, subtly flavored, melt in your mouth confections make me a very happy lady. And the choices of flavors, wow! In my opinion the salted caramel reigns supreme but there wasn't a dud in the bunch. They are also selling meringues and homemade marshmallows.

Access to the macarons is limited by the hours of the Kingsland Farmer's Market. Prices are $2 each or 6 for $11."}
