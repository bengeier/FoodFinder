{"text":"Tried Sunrise Pizza via Eat24 and had a good experience. Good, affordable food, quick delivery time."}
{"text":"Ehh food. Horrible smelling bathroom. Been here a couple times and the use a pizza stand warm scented wax instead of using actual air freshener. Doesn't cover the foulness of the women's bathroom. Probably need to clean the floor drain."}
{"text":"Never had an issue with them love ordering from here. They have some really good food. Specifically the pizza and chicken Alfredo."}
{"text":"The worst pizza ever the crust was doughy.The cheese was so greasy.Will never go here ever again"}
{"text":"We ordered from here and the pizza took an hour and a half to get to me. It was ICE cold and when I called the restaurant the lady on the phone told me that they would not make a new one because the owner was the one that cooked it and gave it to the delivery guy. I called the restaurant again and the lady that answered told me that sunrise pizza was a horrible business and not professional. That should say enough if the employees are talking shit about the place they work for... worst place ever they can shove that ice cold pie where the sun dont shine!"}
{"text":"Just had Sunrise Pizza for the first time and would definitely eat there again!  I ordered through Grub Hub and was quoted an hour delivery time and it came in 30 minutes. This was thw hottest delivery food we have received in a long time! The pizza was so good my picky 4 year old had 2 pieces. The sandwiches we ordered were great and huge, we were so full we couldn't eat the fries. Next time we will try breakfast,  because who doesn't want breakfast delivered?"}
{"text":"Come here order here at least twice a week. My son and I have NEVER gotten anything we didn't like. Best kept secret!"}
{"text":"Another win for Sunrise! Great service.  Great food!

Again.  So impressed.  Tonight we decided to try the fish fry appetizer.  It should be an entree.   We are from Wisconsin.  We know a good fish fry.  Although not a Wisconsin FF there's was fantastic!!!  

 Never disappointed.  We are moving to  Boulder City.  But I have a few reasons to be in NLV and we have decided that when I'm in this area I get wings, pizza, burgers, fish and several appetizers from Sunrise!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed.
The noddles for my Fettuccini Alfredo were over cooked and mushy and the onion and lettuce for my salad were wilted."}
{"text":"Order from here on a regular basis. The food is always on point and the delivery is superb. Drivers is extremely friendly too!"}
{"text":"I always used to order from them and the food used to be amazing! ... Not sure what happened. Food seems to be overly greasy and low quality compared to my past experiences ....anyways I reluctantly ordered from them when I was desperate which sucks because the one delivery guy was awesome.. I don't think il ever be that desperate for food again. X.x"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever experienced, seriously, my husband and I ordered take out, but my husband had no cash on him at the time; I called ahead and told them I'd be five mins late so I could meet them at my house and pay. The lady on the other end replied \"that's fine\". I pull up to my house, my husband is livid, the driver was pretty much a complete dick, my husband told the driver I was running late, and asked that he'd wait 5 mins,and that we'd tip him once I got to our house..He(the driver) threw the biggest fit,and yelled NO! (We only live literally 3 mins from the restaurant which is why I didn't understand why he went off on my husband) He throws the food back into his bumish looking car(as he's yelling just about every curse word you can think of) and takes off. I drive to the restaurant to speak to a manager because at this point I'm pissed. I get there(I'm with my pregnant coworker,bc she really wanted to eat) When I finally speak to someone, she said she was a manager, but I highly doubt it, because if she was, she wouldn't have offered us some bootleg dvds,as a mend.(Was it because I'm black?)I just ended up walking out. I absolutely DO NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone with standards. And if you don't want to be racially profiled,don't eat here."}
{"text":"I've ordered before dinner and everything was ok and customer service we ok ... Well today I ordered an meat lovers Omelet and asked for NO HAM instead extra bacon or sausage and to have my hash browns crispy ... My meal arrived NOTHING like I'd ordered it .. My hash browns were under cooked and My Omelet had no other meat in it except Ham ... And when placing my phone order the lady who took the order was rude and rushing me off the phone ... That's probably why she fucked up my order ... It only takes one bad experience to turn me completely off and I will never order from here again"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often but this is one I had to do. I've ordered 3 times so far and will definitely continue. The food is awesome, fast delivery, food is super hot when it gets to my door. Everything seems fresh. You can tell they take pride in what they do. If you haven't tried it yet go for it."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I ever had. It was called \"Mr. Food Pizza\" and supposed to have sausage, pepperoni, peppers & onion on it. They forgot the pepperoni and there were just a few very thin slices of sausage (or something). The cheese wasn't even melted. Took a few bites and tossed it in the trash."}
{"text":"Hungry after a long night in Vegas stopped in for breakfast and had excellent steak and eggs done to perfection. Waitress was a Seahawks fan which was a bonus for those of us from the Pacific Northwest. Sundance Kid next door had Golden Tee so we can keep up on our game."}
{"text":"When the wings are cooked good I love this place, The pizza is always great!! and the ranch do not get me started"}
{"text":"Really Tasty pizza probably best I've had in North LV. Ordered Garlic Cheese Bread but they gave us just the regular garlic bread, which was good- the marinara sauce was amazing so much so that I would order spaghetti or something that comes with that next time. Only complaint was salad was warm and wilted when it arrived, maybe the driver had it sitting on top of the pizza boxes or maybe because it was packed in a bag with the garlic bread. 4.5 overall experience but taste was def 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The first time I had the Lasagna was a week and a half ago it was delicious absolutely perfect. I ordered the same thing tonight and it was not good close to horrible maybe the cook was different or maybe I ordered too late not sure, but not sure I will try it again."}
{"text":"First time was so delicious and worth the wait...We ordered again two nights later! 

Delivery was a bit earlier than expected and the food tasted fresh from the oven!"}
