{"text":"The service was good no complaints there. The food however was not. I got the crab cakes that still had shell in them the butter sauce was very rich, and everything that was fried seemed like they used the same batter. Like i said service was good but the food had much to be desired."}
{"text":"My husbands parents came in from Chicago & wanted to take them out for dinner.  Groupon had a great deal of dinner for four.  So bought the deal, took them there for dinner.  It's a cozy place, server was nice, & food was ok. I didn't expect much from the place but the parents had the steaks & they really enjoyed it.  I had the frog legs & it was dipped fried frog legs nothing special. My husband had a combo with crab, lobster, & shrimp & he liked it as well.  We got our food very fast. 

Found it very odd that while waiting for our food We kept hearing a banging sound, guess we sat right next to the kitchen.  We get our soups/salads & the chef comes out & asked very nicely if we could move so he could go down the basement so he can fix something.  (He came out in his dirty apron :/ ) Apparently we were seated in the corner that is blocking a door & I thought it was just a closet but i was wrong that was the only door down to the basement. Very inconvenient as we had started eating our soup/salad

I thought the restaurant was right next to the lake but it was across & they didn't have a view at all.  But there's a small park nearby that is just beautiful with a great view of the lake. It was perfect timing to because we got to see the sunset. 

Overall,  I think food was ok, great services, great  price. Nothing special about the place except maybe the park that's nearby with an awesome view."}
{"text":"Nothing good to report. Slow service, damp and smelled like mold. Men's room had a strong urine smell. Food was bland. Calamari was 5 rings, I thought they brought an order of onion rings. I normally only post a review if the food is excellent . Rarely post a negative review. I wouldn't return for free food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for a retirement dinner. The food on the buffet  was  horrible. The chicken was raw. The sliced beef chewy and   I guess the so called baked potatoes were very ,very dry. The mixed veggies were cold and not even seasoned as well. I had one drink and it was so watered down it tasted like  water. And can you believe the restaurant forgot all about making the dessert for everyone???  Will not go back there. The place needs updating too.
Almost forgot this the rigatoni didn't have any sauce on it as well. Don't waste your money by going there."}
{"text":"Awful.  Have eaten here 5 or so times over the past 10 years....awful.  Keep giving it another shot just in case it has improved and it has not.  Cannot for the life of me imagine why people go here on purpose.  Food is often cold, overcooked, not fresh."}
{"text":"Should you happen to find yourself in Sheffield Lake at dinner time, this is a perfectly nice place to dine.
The Lake Erie perch dinner was a nice treat that I remember from my childhood and you just can't get it elsewhere (i.e., VT, CA, FL). The spaghetti with marinara sauce that came with it was sub-average and certainly not al dente. My wife's 12 oz. prime rib Queen cut was very good.
Service was also good and overall ambiance is strictly mid-western, if you know what I mean..."}
{"text":"The Amber Oaks Restaurant is very poorly managed.  I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.  You can do much better going else where.  Prices are very high for the low quality of the food.  But, go at night and you will most likely have the place all to your self.  The word is out and they don't seem to get much business these days.  Will not go back there. The place really needs updating too.  The bathroom was horrible,  That says it all...."}
{"text":"This place needs to be condemned. Stinks of mold, and the food is atrocious. Server was nice, that doesnt make up for the watered down drinks. Wish I had a bulldozer, all that would be left of Amber Oaks is the bad memory."}
{"text":"Tried Amber Oaks with friends on a Saturday evening. We had no expectations, and was wonderfully impressed. Good service. Lots of attention given. Menu had nice choices. We had prime rib,  shrimp fettuccine,  the house Lake Erie fried perch and steak, and Walleye. All came with soup or salad, veggie or baked potato. We were all pleased. Delicious!"}
