{"text":"If you are looking for a quick cheap bite around bloor and spadina go here.  They always service cheap, quick, and delcious food.   The portions are quite big and fill up even a always hungry student."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both had the chicken shwarma, and they were delicious! No complaints really. The meat was moist, and the sauce ratio was perfect. I like that there is a mini patio set up out front, great for people watching."}
{"text":"First off, the Google map is showing the restaurant in the wrong place.  It should be on the South-West corner of Bloor and Spadina, sandwiched in between Greg's Ice Cream and the JCC.

Secondly, this is a great place to go for falafel.  I've heard good things about the shawarma as well, but since I'm not the biggest fan (I find the meat is too often fatty or grisly), I just stick to what I know.

On a given lunchhour during the work/school week, the line can go out the door of the super tiny little shop.  Luckily enough, the staff have making pita sandwiches down to an art, and the line moves speedily enough.  The menu is as basic as it gets - several types of shawarma and falafel pita sandwiches and platters, and a few other sides like french fries.  The falafel sandwich is a steal at only 3 bucks a pop.  Get it loaded up with all the toppings you love - if you aren't sure, honestly, just get it with everything, it's easier for everyone and makes the line go quicker.  Be sure to get hot sauce and then wait patiently as they slice your meat/fry your falafels, then load up your sandwich with toppings and drop it in the sandwich press.  They wrap up the pitas nearly faster than the naked eye can see.  Grab it and get out of there, only eat in the crowded shop if it's life or death - there's parks and benches all over the place!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawarma) is excellent here. Cheap as well, around $5 for a shawarma and a drink.

The dessert they have here is a traditional baklava (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava)

Only complaints are the spice used doesn't seem too spicy, and it's *always* busy on a Friday or Saturday night :-) The shawarmas are *that* good."}
{"text":"Tried a chicken shawarma because it was late and felt too tired to go too far.  I feel the taste is ok, not spectacular but not too bad either.  The sauce tastes strong but I like strong taste, chicken tends to be dry tho.  Typical take out spot and good after late night drinking.  2.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"My favorite shawarma in the whole city! The chicken shawarma has an amazing bark on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside, perfectly spiced. All the vegetables and the pita are always fresh and the garlic sauce is some of the best I've ever had. The owner and the staff are always amazing too. A really great place in the city for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good, fast and reasonably priced Mediterranean standbys. I've been eating and enjoying their shawarma wraps three to five times a week for about three years now. They fry up fresh falafel while you wait, and this year they've added a juice bar for fresh squeezed juice and smoothies.
Tried the falafel salad today, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Used to like this place ok for a quick bite in a pinch, but they served me improperly cooked meat on Saturday so that's the end of that.  I recommend avoiding this place, too much risk of getting sick."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place 1 star but alas I must. I came here way too often and I gave them so many chances! There just have been too many slip ups to make me wanting to go back. For example, clearly giving me someone else's order and saying that it's okay to take it or not telling me an item was unavailable but still charging me for it and giving me something else without telling me. I just don't think this place is for me anymore. Sure it's great when you're drunk and there is nothing else open, but that really doesn't fly with me. It's too bad because I actually really liked their strong garlic sauce."}
{"text":"stuffed pockets

For now, guess what I ate yesterday? The same thing I had the day before. That's right - two days in a row!?!

Late Sunday afternoon I was running errands along Bloor, near Spadina, when I realized I was starving because I hadn't had time to eat all day. Then I remembered that my dear Jimmy Neutron likes Pita Q. I would never have thought to go in because of their signage. It's horrific. 

But I trust Jimmy, and he likes it. Chicken shawarmas are 1 for $5 or 2 for $9. I had one on Sunday (and then two on Monday...). It's simple, flavourful, and garlicky. Four sauces - hummus, tahini, hot sauce and some other garlic infused goodness - shaved chicken, turnips, pickles, fresh lettuce and tomatoes. I prefer to skip the onions and parsley.

Then they toast it. Not everyone does that. Everyone really should.

It was delicious. Cheap and cheerful. I really need that right now. I spent the last two-and-a-half weeks having way too much fun. Too much fun means my pants don't fit and I'm haemorrhaging money.

But good times are priceless, aren't they?"}
{"text":"Ate here at around 430 am after dancing all night on Bloor street earlier that evening. With limited choices at that hour, my friends and I figured shawarma was one of the better options. 

The beef shawarmas were almost pretty good except they way they're stuffed and folded keeps all the veggies on one side while the meat is on the other so it's pretty impossible to get all the flavours in one bite. 

They use smaller than usual pitas, but that along with my yogurt drink I was pretty full from it. 

It's in no way authentic: the tahini is too runny, they use those obnoxiously coloured turnips, and the beef was a bit salty, but if you are looking for something quick and filling this place is good enough :) 

Not sure if I would really come back."}
{"text":"This place is alright. After tasting the most incredible (and student-budget-friendly) shawarma for the last five months in Europe, Pita Q was a bit underwhelming. The price is fair ($5.81, I believe, for a chicken shawarma sandwich) but I have paid a similar amount/slightly more for far superior quality/taste. The chicken didn't taste like shawarma to me as much as it did fried chicken (not sure if it's because I ordered at 10pm? In any case, the place was open until 1am that night so I would expect that they try to keep the quality consistent over the long stretch of the day for which they seem to operate). I asked for extra hot sauce which might have been a mistake on my part in retrospect as the sauce's flavour was somewhat tangy (think Tabasco as opposed to Sriracha) and I tend to prefer a pure spicey taste to a more sour one, but that one could be just me :) One nice part of the experience was the service - the cashiers were very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for late night shawarma right after leaving Madison pub. There was a line up of students which is great because that meant the chicken spinner was spinning fresh meat. I ordered a chicken shawarma. It was fresh and tasty. Friendly service. Low prices. Place was crowded so I recommend eating it outside. I never had such fresh shawarma during late night (to be fair I was wasted)."}
{"text":"Not sure of all the bad reviews here.  Maybe I came at a good time.  I was waiting for my volleyball game to start and I've always wanted to try this place. I saw the falafel wrap was $3.79+tax, which works out to $4 even.  The falafels were nice and crispy (I counted and I believe they put 3 falafels in the wrap) and complemented the veggies nicely.  The wrap wasn't huge, but it was a decent size and it'd be good for a light eater or someone looking for a snack.  Service was also fast and friendly.  

If you are looking for a quick, affordable snack and are in the area, I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Falafel was really unpleasant and I felt sick after eating. There are much better places near by."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the 2 shawarma for $8.39 deal!

If $2 shawarma existed, I would imagine it taste similar to this place. 

1. The chicken and beef were extremely dry. Not sure if I came at a bad time but when meat is visibly dry it's just not right to serve it!

2. Dry meat is harder to eat when you're given very little sauce! Not to mention the sauce was watered down and had the viscosity of water. 

3. Without a doubt, the art of packing pita is difficult to master. Bites shouldn't be so variable because all the toppings are on one side and all the meat on the other. These guys need to figure out another layout for their shawarma!

Walk to Pita Land around the corner!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a chicken shawarma for lunch.

For $5, you get a good sized stuffed pita; definitely a cheap eat. 

Pita Q was 'meh'; as Leeor J mentioned, the sauce was very strong with garlic and it seemed to overpower the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel, only to feel very sick and nauseous for hours after. My friend got the beef shawarma and felt fine, but avoid the falafel!!!!!"}
{"text":"What's with all the whinging over this place? IMHO this place is fantastic and I'm definitely not the only one to think so as this place always has a line, one that extends outside the door on late weekend nights.

After living in the Middle East for quite some time and moving to DC, I've learned to accept that I would never get decent shawarma again. Until I found this place! Tastes just like the old homestead, especially with that garlicky sauce. Falafels are made fresh, you can see them frying away seconds after uttering your order, and that's unbeatable.
The chicken is flavorful, the rice is lemony, and the salad is crisp. The staff are chatty and cute.
And did I mention that everything is mostly under $5? A falafel shawarma, for example, is shockingly cheap ($3.50)."}
{"text":"I got  shawarma here before hopping into the subway.

The shawarma was huge, but nothing special. I asked for a bit of extra pickles in mine, and I saw him grab a huge handful and just toss it in. It became super salty.

But everything else tasted awesome.

I ordered the fries as well, but they were raw when given to me.

I tried eating them, but by the time I reached my subway stop, i was not interested anymore."}
{"text":"I've had the falafel sandwich a couple of times here. And really, that overly garlicly sauce that tasted too much like caesar dressing really ruins their food. It's overpowering and not much of the other flavours come through. Very disappointing. 

This place gets two stars rather than one because their employees are good-looking. I'm serious."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma! I got the chicken shawarma and it was stuffed just right. There garlic sauce is really good, my favourite so far! Had it also with my fries really good. The people were very nice. Overall great first time experience."}
{"text":"A couple years ago when I was staying downtown, I would always drop by Pita Q to pick up a chicken platter. Their chicken was always fresh and their garlic sauce was so delicious. There were several occasions when the taste wasn't consistent, but overall I always enjoyed their food. Whenever I'm in the area, Pita Q is my go-to Middle Eastern fast food joint."}
{"text":"Quick and efficient. Exactly what you'd expect. The chicken shawarma was good and the falafel were well made. Most decent place for a quick, inexpensive, filling lunch."}
{"text":"I think it says a lot that my entire office is basically a stone's throw away from this restaurant, and yet we still avoid it like the plague. It is inexplicably busy during lunch time, despite the fact that the food here is terrible. Sarah's is a significantly better choice for falafel/shawarma, and it is only two minutes' walk west on Bloor.

Do not go here."}
{"text":"I totally agree with what Joe D. says. This place is a waste of time. Just go to Sarah's if you're in the area. The meat at this place is flavourless and the sauce is way too garlicy."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I had a dish bought for me and it was overly salty... like I couldn't finish the food salty. 

I had a small, cheap salad made with ice-berg lettuce, hummus, falafel and a whole pile of rice underneath.... WAY TOO SALTY ALL ROUND! 

I've had a chicken sherwarma before and to me it was rather dry. I've had far better sherwarma before as well as falafel plates at other places.

I will not return, end of story."}
{"text":"This was my first shawarma experience and Toronto. I used to frequent this spot every week, but now that I'm rarely in the area I don't get a chance to go here. This place makes a great chicken shawarma and a great falafel sandwich. I particularly like the garlic sauce they add to their sandwiches. I think it adds a nice touch, and for me, the more garlic flavour the better! 

You can sometimes get a deal at this place when you buy two shawarmas, and so for this reason I always like to go with another person! With so many shawarma places to choose from on the Bloor strip I have settled on this one for its quick service and delicious food. The guys who work here are also quite friendly to talk to!"}
{"text":"Small shop but great food! I tried the beef shawarma and in my opinion they gave too much meat haha! I love how soft the pita bread is that they put the shawarma ingredients in, it's nice and soft, not dry or hard like the other places I've tried. Too bad it's so far away from home, I'd come here every night!"}
{"text":"More than met my expectations for flavour, price, and quantity.  I got the two shwarma special for $8.39 and was amazed at the amount of food.  Under the old ownership, many years ago, the 2 shwarma special barely satisfied me, but these guys are great.  I will definitely come back to Pita Q."}
{"text":"I went looking for a place to eat at 10:30pm on Bloor and the hotel manager said my choices were pizza, fried chicken, or this place.  So I went here and had the beef Shwarma.  It was neither terrible nor good...it was quite plain and obviously low quality, but for the price...and the time...it was fine.  I don't think I'd go back again unless I was stuck in the same late-night situation.  And even then I suspect that I'll find something better in the area even for late nights eats after I've been around a while longer.  So if you need a cheap bite to eat then this might be good for you, but if you'll pay for quality then this isn't for you.  Even the baklava tastes kinda weird."}
{"text":"I have been pretty unimpressed with shwarmas in Toronto, and this place didn't help.

 It's run by a guy who clearly is more interested in making money, rather than quality of service. I can't believe I have to say this, but please give me back all of my change. Don't tsk customers who are making a mess. If don't want a mess, spend more money on the paper that you're wrapping your pita in.

The pita itself was forgettable and so messy at the end that I just gave up and threw it out. At least the service by the cooks is friendly, the food is given to you quickly, and the pricing is really decent. And surprisingly, the veggies were quite fresh which was quite nice.

I don't think I'll go back though and I won't be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I decided to pop in here quickly after a sudden craving for Middle Eastern food. My choices in the area were limited, so hey, don't blame me. 

I asked the cashier if I could have something like a salad, and he insisted on the tabbouleh. I explained that I didn't want tabbouleh, and just a salad with falafel on it. He said he understood and told the cook to make it. He charged me about $6.80 for it, which was overpriced in my opinion. All that came in my takeout container was flimsy, sad, and old salad and four balls of falafel, which is weird, considering the falafel shawarma comes with the exact same stuff AND a pita, and still costs less. Whatever, the old cashier man seemed too nice to complain to.

I noticed something weird about the deep fryer: it looked like the oil was overly hot and burning, and this concerned me. Later, while eating the falafel, I verified my previous concern. The falafel was burnt on the outside, and half raw on the inside. Gross! It was also really REALLY salty. I'm talking at least 500mg sodium per falafel. What the hell?! I was especially sad because I don't really ever eat deep fried foods and thought I should let myself this one time. Yuck. 

As expected, my stomach was turning and making noises for the hours after I'd eaten the falafel. That could have been just from the deep fried-ness, but still, I think part of it had to do with the rawness? I'm not sure yet. Either way, I am now terrified to eat falafel unless I make it myself (baked, not fried, might I add), and I find it a true shame that such establishments continue to exist after horrible food is served. Also, might I now mention that I told the man four times that the order is to-go, yet he failed to provide me with a fork or spoon or any utensil to eat the food with? Ugh. Sad."}
{"text":"For my money, this place has the best chicken shawarma on the strip of Bloor, and the only one I really like to return to (other than Ghazale or Laila to try more of their sides). 

There are three main reasons why I prefer Pita Q over the other shawarma/falafel places: Their chicken is the best spiced, their garlic sauce is the tastiest, and their pickled turnips seem the most fresh and crisp. The rice and salad and stuff is nothing special, but who cares? It's rice and salad and stuff; not the main event.

The biggest drawback here is the size of the platter meal. I think it's slightly cheaper than other places ($7.49?) but you only get a rectangle sized take-out container. It's more than enough for a meal, but not enough for two, which you'll usually get from the others."}
