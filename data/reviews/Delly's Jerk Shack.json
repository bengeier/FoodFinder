{"text":"If you see this little Jamaican painted food truck in the parking lot of Summerwinds, do yourself a favor and stop by to pick up some of the most amazing jerk chicken you will ever taste! And he is super nice to be sure to tip him for his amazing prices, flavor, and the fact that he puts so much love into his food! The beans and rice are super moist and full of flavor and his plantains are caramelized so sweet, just the way we like em! Amazing Jamaican vibe and food!"}
{"text":"I cant even start to tell you how good this food is. I have never had jamaican food that is this authentic here in Phoenix. Hands down the most delicious jerk chicken. So much complexity to the sauce, not too much spice as to overwhelm all the other flavors. Tender juicy chicken. I've also had the wings, which are out of this world with the jerk sauce. Fried plantains are a bit of an obsession. Perfectly ripe, fried to perfection... little bites of heaven. You need to visit this truck. If you like spice, hit it up!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best jerk chicken I've ever had, and I've had my fair share. The chicken was tender enough to fall off the bone, but still had enough body to bite into. I'm the type that eats everything but the bone; give me the skin, fat, cartilage... every bit was delicious. Nice balance of smokiness, and just the slightest hint of spice that warmed the lips, but nothing that should cause hesitation for those who don't go for spicy.  

I also had the rice and beans (rice and peas) which was equally impressive. Rice was buttery, flavorful, and fluffy where most Jamaican rice I've had tends to be dense and heavy. Beans were the real deal, not the canned slow cut I've seen other places take. 

I found this gem across from Chars Has The Blues on a Saturday night. I got the impression it's a regular spot to find the trailer. It's a small trailer pulled by a truck, not the big boxy food trucks we see everywhere. Several menu options, impressive considering the gentleman was cooking in a space about the size of a closet. Friendly service with a genuine, warm smile. 

Keep an eye out! Well worth it. $10 got me six pieces of chicken and a good two cups plus of rice and beans. If it wasn't so tasty it could be three meals, but I'll probably finish it off in two."}
{"text":"Excellent tilapia n plantains! Our Canadian friends loved the jerk chicken sandwich and chicken taco as well. Now Really can't wait to get back to the island next month!"}
{"text":"Best Jerk food in the Valley! Great guy, great food, nothing but good vibes! What more could you ask for?!"}
