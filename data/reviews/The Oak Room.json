{"text":"Cool place!! That lobster Mac and cheese was delicious! Have local brews on tap. Definitely headed back!"}
{"text":"We were in town this week for Thanksgiving and stopped by for a meal. Concerned at first as there were just a few cars in the lot, all had to do with the holiday week. Inside the food was excellent. Had the roasted pheasant with a killer gravy sauce. Salads were fresh, desserts were awesome and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, with a perfect balance of food quality and custumer service. Definitely a restaurant worth trying out."}
{"text":"Gave it a try and I would say that the chef knows what he's doing!  Everything we ordered from appetizer being the Pork Belly confit tacos to Lobster roll & Seafood Provencal -- Everything was delicious, simple but very tasty... Staff was very knowledgeable of what they have and cocktail drinks were very satisfying! Place is not crowded at all since it was late afternoon Sunday and I believe not a lot of people know this place yet...  We'll be back to try some of the other items on the menu.."}
{"text":"Saw the sign while looking to grab a quick drink before an event. Wow!  What a surprise!  Excellent beer choices, nice wine selection and an interesting menu. Bonus is the tree in the dining room!    Owners mom gave us a tour, pointing out the local artist offerings on the walls as being for sale.   Stop in. You'll be pleasantly surprised- and back for more!"}
{"text":"The decor was non-existent, it felt empty and hollow,  it seemed like it was a shell of a building with some non - descript tables and chairs tossed in it, waiting for the decorations to arrive. And talk about waiting... get ready to do lots of it.  Although there seem to employees all over, they don't appear to be there for customers. Although the place was less than 10% occupied, and no one of front of us... there was quite a wait to be seated. Once seated, another long wait for a server.  Another wait for beverages.   And all the time employees wandering around. When the food arrived, the first thought that went through my mind was..I wonder where I'm going to stop to eat on the way home. I've never had smaller portions served to me.  The fish was tasty, as was the shrimp, and the burger was ok,  the fries were cold. When we were through (which was very soon... since there is only so long you can stretch out a portion that size)... the next wait began. We sat at a table empty of all food for longer than all our other waits combined. And all the while, employees wandered around. And with nothing but concrete floors and bare walls the noise of everything was annoying.  And still we waited.  The value for the dining experience was as low as I have ever experienced.  It was $70 for 3 people,  no booze, and we all left hungry. I shant be back."}
{"text":"WARNING! This is probably the least funny review that I have written.   Sooooooooo disappointed. It's like when you see this guy or gal and you're like, \"hey, I like the way you looks and I think we could be good to each others\" and they're like \"hey, ditto\" and then you're like \"let's get a drinks and dinner some times\" and they're like, \"check the hours on my door, yo!\" Then like you get all dudded up and you head to their place and you sit down and take a closer look and you're all \"meh.\" But you're like \"no! first dates are awkward sometimes and I really think this thing could be great. I'm going to give it another couple or 7 tries.\"   I love downtown Mesa and was pretty excited when I first heard talk of The Oak Room! And, although there are glimmers, unfortunately, it is not all that great. It's like, \"everything else is closed. :( I guess we could go to The Oak Room. :/ \" That's not really a great thing.  One of the glimmers is, according to my animal eating friends, The Oak Room's food is pretty good mostly and really good fairly often. I have had their French fries (which at the time I did not think to ask what they were fried in. I'm still pretty new to this veggie change) minus the gravy and they were darn tasty. Their beer selection is fairly typical, a few of the craft types, and their liquor selection is standard although, I haven't ever really looked above eye-level sitting on a bar stool. A little tarnish on that glimmer is that the prices for alcohol are a little high.   Another glimmer is the service. I have never had service that was even close to bad. The service has always been friendly and efficient.   One of the few things working against The Oak Room is their location. The owners started out with a very bold and new idea for downtown-ish Mesa in not the greatest location. It's not a bad location but for something this bold in DT Mesa it needs to be on Main St. between Center and Country Club or close enough to it that people walking on Main can see it. They seem to be busy during Mesa Amphitheater events but I imagine that alone won't keep the doors open for too long.   Speaking of open doors! Part of the boldness was that they were going to be open until 1 am during the week! Holy poop! I'm in! However, after talking with one of the bartenders, I learned that they really had no plan for how they were going to manage that. I asked if they were planning on doing an industry night or two and nope. I asked about a reverse happy-hour type deal and nope. I asked a few other questions that I can't remember now but were kind of in the area of ways to get people to come in late on week days but all were nope. The gist was that they don't want to attract \"those-kind\" of people. Those kind who just go there to drink, I guess?  I'm one of \"those-kind\" of people (I guess it's worked because I'm not all that attracted anymore). But furealz! how did they imagine that they would attract not \"those-kind\" of people to come to their bar/restaurant until 1 am on a Tuesday in Mesa? This doesn't really add or subtract to The Oak Room itself nonetheless, I imagine it has hit them in their morales when they had to change the hours because there weren't enough of not \"those-kind\" of people coming through the doors at that late hour. They have since changed their hours to 12am Tue - Sat. This is still pretty darn good for a DT area Mesa restaurant so definitely one of the glimmers here.   Speaking still of open doors! Another glimmer is that they have a patio! It's not a great patio but I'll take it. There are benches and I can smoke with my drink and that is what is really important to me. However, like many other bits of glimmer, they probably need some landscaping and definitely some shade!   All-in-all, The Oak Room is just okay. I hope they are able to iron a few things out and have the tenacity to succeed and become an established part of DT Mesa."}
{"text":"Decided to give The Oak Room a try last week. Here's the unvarnished review.  Decor - they must have run out of funds to decorate the main dining room. Grey walls, large grey squares (yes) hung around the walls, an artificial \"Oak Tree\" in the middle of the room, and polished concrete floors.  Food - the menu is decidedly limited. In addition they include Rabbit and a Wild Boar Sloppy Joe on the menu. There's no place for these exotics on a limited menu. Further, they have a few items with cream sauces and of the few Pasta choices none have a tomato based sauce. Cream, particularly heavy cream, does not always agree with many digestive systems and, again, with a limited menu, should be replaced with a more universal item. Also, why have an item like filet mignon on a limited menu? And, the Veal dish was priced at least $10 below that of any good restaurant. This could be interpreted as either good (what a bargain!) or bad (it can't be the good veal at this price). I chose the latter and moved on to the ubiquitous hamburger. It was good, better than average, and, at $11 was reasonable priced. The fries were very good as well.  Service - friendly, attentive. However, at the empty table behind us there was food all over the floor as if someone had uplifted their plate and dumped the contents on the floor. Besides being a mess, it was disgusting to look at. When I told our waitress, she said they were working on it. During our time there, no staff even approached this mess. It was there when we left. I don't know the reason this wasn't attended to but there isn't one really.  As I live in the area, it would be nice if the Management got their act together a bit. Take a second look at the menu, if you can't deliver Oysters Bienville when ordered, take it off the menu (it's an ambitious item for any menu). First impressions mean a great deal; do not allow spilled food to remain on the floor for any lenght of time. A word to the wise should be sufficient!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! Excellent lobster Mac and cheese! Our food server Katie is a delight and fun and fresh atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Slow, bad and rude service. Scotch eggs were actually pickled eggs with bacon on the side. Really! Bartender had a meltdown when we asked if we could order dinner at the bar. We just happened to mention that we felt ignored. He immediately summoned the owner, who was the first person to ignore us. He apologized and tried to offer us free food. We told him we'd really like to see him fix the problems. Mesa is not a good place to dine. BTW, the one owner is named Cory. I was really hoping to find a good, independently owned place in Mesa. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and I love this place!  It's  nice to come to an establishment with a unique menu. I had the Portuguese Garlic Shrimp, outstanding.   My wife had Spicy Mac and Cheese, also very good (I tried it). It's clean with a nice ambiance!  Shawn the bartender is knowledgeable and personable.  We came on Sunday early evening and it was quiet.  Great music playlist too.  We'll be back...Lots of menu items we want to try."}
{"text":"We had service pretty quickly as it was dead on a Wed evening.  I got two appetizers mixed up and ordered the wrong one.  Literally within a minute I asked server to change it and she told me my food was already cooking but asked if I wanted to add the other thing.  I thought that was bullshit but whatever.  Two minutes later we got the cheese curds which were decent but nothing special.  Had the marinara been flavorful instead of watered down it would have been better. We ordered a Cubano and a burger.  Although the meat on the Cubano looks like it is lacking there is enough on there to pull the flavors and make a delicious sandwich.  The bread was just perfect: the texture, the amount, the flavor.  So while I thought it could be a bit bulkier I was absolutely happy with this sandwich.  Good job!   The burger was sad.  It was cooked exactly how I wanted it, medium, so that wasn't it.  It was the flavor.  I thought it was going to have pork belly in the burger but it was like 1 piece on top.  I could tell the quality of the meat was good, just completely lacking in basic seasoning or a \"pop\" to bring it to life.  They covered my salad in oil so definitely ask to dress yourself. Fries were good too. There were a lot of other things that looked good on the menu and I am excited to try other offerings.  They claim on the menu to get as much as they can sourced in locally, very respectable.  Our waitress told us that most everything is made in house so bonus points for that too.  The price tags are a little high if you don't consider these things. I will definitely be back, just not for a burger."}
{"text":"Decided to give the Oak Room a try on Valentines Day, despite some mixed reviews.   I should give just 1 star, but benefit of the doubt prevails.    There was a fixed menu for the dinner this evening.  I don't generally like those,  but what the heck,  it's Valentines Day.  The Good -  promptly seated for our reservation,  and the hostess was very pleasant.     The not so Good -  wait staff - where to begin.   They were slow and not very attentive. (Was not that busy while we were there).   Simple things like,  refill a drink, or ask my wife if she wanted another drink -  nope.   We asked for our dessert to go, and she brought the wrong dessert.   Oh,  and our server tried to deliver a beer to the wrong table, she brought it to us and asked if we had ordered it,  nope... not us either....  get the picture?  We both ordered Filet Mignon with béarnaise sauce, mashed potatoes and veg.    The potatoes were just barely warm enough to eat.  The sauce was terrible,  very very salty.  The meat had no flavor and a mealy type texture.   Ok, the potatoes actually were good,  just not warm.  My wife said the beans were good.   I was so hoping we would have found another gem... not this time. Maybe their regular menu would be better -  don't think I'll find out.  So,  maybe it should be just 1 star?"}
{"text":"They served my 9-year old liquor in her kiddie cocktail (on 3/4/17) because the bartender didn't know there was alcohol in Dekuyper Razzmatazz. When I asked the bartender what they made the drink with (because it clearly wasn't cherry juice) he said, \"oh just this fruity stuff, it's good\". I saw it was Dekuyper while he was pouring it and even asked if there was alcohol in it, to which he said, \"no\". I worked in the liquor industry for 10 years and have even sold Dekuyper. I thought maybe they had made a NA version of it that I didn't know about. I went back to my table to Google it, but I knew what I saw and I had to see the bottle myself so I went back to the bar and asked them again about what they put in the drink. Bartender still said (matter of factly) there is no alcohol in it and presented the bottle to me. I had to point out the part on the label that says 16.5%/33 proof - he seemed shocked. For a restaurant to put a person behind the bar who does not know alcohol laws or what has alcohol in it is irresponsible. More importantly, don't argue with a guest. Especially when it comes to possibly serving a 9 YEAR OLD liquor. He tried to claim he didn't now it was for a kid and the server swears she told him. Either way, it was a kids cup, and when has a kiddie cocktail ever had alcohol in it? Manager was apologetic, but didn't really offer up a solution to the problem. Makes me wonder how many other kids have been served alcohol there."}
{"text":"I will not be back, due to management and service. This place looked very promising. The menu looked great, they have craft beer options on tap, so we decided to give it a try. Amongst other things, we ordered the quinoa and avocado salad. The cumin dressing wasn't exactly what I was expecting so I politely asked to send the salad back. The manager came and spoke to us, asked if we'd like to try anything else, and since everyone else was done with their meals we said no thank you. He refused to take the salad off our bill and offered to buy us a drink instead. It may not sound like a big deal but we already made it clear that we weren't drinking; yet he was insisting that we order a drink \"on the house\" because we still had to pay for the salad... This management practice is confusing to me- having worked In the restaurant industry before. You'd think he would want to create a nice experience in the hopes of having repeat customers. This bar is the halfway point between all of us and I am really disappointed that this bar will not be our regular watering hole. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Owner takes great care of customers, highly recommended!! We arrived before business hours and the owner served us himself. AND in a timely manner. Super clean, cool atmosphere as well. Will go back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD!!!!! We went here on December 5th. The food was AMAZING and so was the service!  these guys deserve a ton of recognition and praise!!! Highly recommend The Oak Room!!!!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at 445, we were the only people in this very drab restaurant. Concrete floors, no color of fabric, just table, needs lots of work.  Oak tree was nice tho. Our server,Jimmy I think, was very attentive and informed.  My friend ordered a coke zero and brochette board.  The coke was watery and server said it wasn't working right. Then came back and said they were out of the salmon for the brochette, so she ordered a different kind.  two of the four had so much garlic to be inedible. I ordered the wild boar sloppy Joe and it was so spicy I couldn't eat it.  The french fries were so crisp that they made a noise when broken in two.  Altho my friend liked them this way, I thought they were awful.  All in all none of the food was satisfactory, nor is the decor.  There were only two more people when we left at 5:43.  Too bad, I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Pheasant was well-prepared, pancetta-wrapped grilled asparagus was perfectly tender. Peanut butter stout was an interesting beer to try once. Innovative menu and creative bar choices combined with an attentive and flexible staff made for a relaxing and fun evening out!"}
{"text":"This place needs a serious makeover.  Food is unacceptable and the decor....nonexistant!  Gross!!"}
{"text":"We're looking forward to many more experiences here. Very diverse and well prepared menu. Pork belly tacos are very good. Very nice selection of local beers and bar staff was very knowledgeable with their drinks. They will do anything you like. Can't wait to see after decorating is completed. But,it's the kind of menu and good fresh food you could eat in any setting. It's just good. And you'll probably be able to try something you've never had before. Oh,the deviled eggs are bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Large portions. Lots of flavour.   Local owner. Hometown flavour.  Staff is all out for every customer.  Very clean. Nice restrooms.  Excellent wine list. Beer list too.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been to. The salad dressing is just straight up mayo. Not even mixed with lemon?? Some of our food was still frozen. The waiter was very charming when we ordered and then magically never appeared again except to plop the bill. Their restroom was covered in urine. I'm still nauseous remembering it. You know that feeling where you want the food and experience to be good and not awful so you keep rationalizing it? Not worth it. Go literally anywhere else. It's empty for a reason!"}
{"text":"First time to the Oak room, good selection of beers on tap, lunch was very good Sally had the arugula salad with hamburger great buns and salad was delicious. I had the Beef Carpaccio and Arugula salad it was awesome, very fresh and very tasty. We will be back. Can't wait to try there dinner menu. 5 stars !"}
{"text":"This is our second time to visit the Oak Room.. First time, we loved the food and cocktails... However, tonight was very disappointing... After a long day of work, my husband and I decided to go to dine out... we chose to go to the Oak Room... It was their year anniversary so they had complimentary hor d'oeuvres... I ordered a quinoa/avocado salad and my husband ordered the spicy lobster mac & cheese.  Salad was alright although there was more spinach than quinoa.... My husband's mac & cheese was not right at all.  We got the waiter's attention, and expressed that there was an odd taste. Since he said earlier that it was one of his favorites, he had a taste of what was served to us... And sure enough, he said that he knew what we were talking about.  So he brings it to the kitchen and comes back with our plate saying its the beer cheese and that the chef had put more than the right amount of beer in it and that's why it has that taste. First of all, the  menu states it only has cheddar cheese in it and NOT beer cheese. Secondly; maybe, there would be a bit of bitterness in a \"Beer Cheese\", however, this taste rotten, sour and rancid. I may not be a certified chef, but I have been running a few restaurants in the valley and would at least know if the food would taste right or not. Lastly, my husband was not even offered anything to rectify this... Not that we were going to accept anything, BUT just looking for a gesture to correct the complaint. This is not in any way our servers fault.  I'm just expressing how inconsiderate and unprofessional they handle customers complaints. We went out to end up eating at home and redo my salad."}
{"text":"I have been to the Oak Room a handful of time for lunch.  The food is consistently good, regardless of the variety of items I have had.  The pork belly tacos are incredible!  The butter lettuce salad was great.  Most recently, I had the lunch menu item Portuguese Garlic Shrimp.  Oh my goodness!!!!!  It was so delicious!  I'm not kidding, I'd order it 10 times again and likely will.  Full of flavor and texture and just amazing.  The owner is very kind, accommodating, knowledgeable, and thoughtful in the gluten free items.  It was very warm sitting at the bar, the air conditioning kicking in every now and then was the only thing that saved me!  I had ordered iced tea and it was really bland, not pleasant to drink.  When asked how my lunch was I raved about the dish and I causally mentioned the iced tea.  The owner shut down immediately and was not very friendly after that, not unkind, just not interested.  Overall, I will be back and will order that shrimp again!!  Or the tacos.... shoot!"}
{"text":"Our experience was underwhelming. I read about this place online and thought it would be a neat new place to try out. We sat at the bar where we were politely greeted. My husband wanted to try one of their speciality cocktails. The server came back and said they were out of their bourbon chai. So my husband tried to order an Old Fashion. The server came back and said they didn't have any bitters.  So then my husband settled on an IPA.  We both ordered an appetizer. I had the pesto pinwheel and my husband had the pork belly tacos. The pinwheels were actually very delicious. My husband enjoyed the tacos as well but stated that they were on the oily side. Our whole time there, the two female workers were focused on their friends at the bar and didn't check in with us very often. We probably would've stayed longer and had more drinks if the service was better. The manager was also sitting at the bar about 4 seats away from us and never said a word to us or any customers while we were there. We asked for the check and paid. We were slightly disappointed that they didn't comp my husband's beer considering they couldn't make his first two drinks of choice. Before we left, I went to use the bathroom and the toilet was clogged with toilet paper and unusable. There was no sign up to notify customers.  Will we be back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I am not a terribly harsh food critic, and I usually will enjoy a dinner simply by the virtue of the company and conversation of those I am with.  It usually takes a lot to dissatisfy me.  That said, I was very disappointed in the food and service at the Oak Room.  As far as I could see, my party of 6 were the only people there that evening.  Despite that, there were several order mistakes and the service was sub par.  We ordered a fairly messy appetizer by the recommendation of the waiter, and were given no place settings/napkins after we were served.  We had to ask, then waited nearly 5 minutes for them to be brought out.  The appetizer was good, but it was the only menu item I liked that evening.  They brought out 5 butter lettuce salads for us even though we had all ordered wedge salads, and the first three entrees were dropped in front of the wrong people before they started asking who ordered what.  I ordered the lobster mac & cheese, which I did not like at all.   I ordered the S'more for dessert, which was also recommended by the waiter.  It may not have been the case, but it tasted like something premade that had just been reheated.   I ordered an extra one to-go for my wife as is my custom when having a business dinner, but when I brought it home and she tried it, it went into the trash after a single bite.  I don't like leaving negative reviews, but this restaurant has some serious challenges to overcome, and I hope they can, but I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Personally saw the owner taking care of an irate customer. Yes. The place was slammed. Yes. The bartender did not take care of the guy immediately. But the bartender was running his ass off.  This place is friendly. From the second we walked through the door we were greeted warmly and promptly. Unfortunately we did not have time to eat. Just had time to have a beer. But we will be back. Be will be telling people to get in here.   Local beer on tap. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Too tired for creativity, just want to give this place 5 stars.  Have come here maybe 8 times over the last year, 7 of those times really nothing to complain about, that one 8th time didn't like the pinwheel appetizer (which happened like half a year ago).  Entrees outstanding- the filet last night was best steak have had this year.  Cheese curds always a highlight.  Inspiring to have a pretty eclectic menu w/mains like pheasant, rabbit, lobster rolls, portuguese inspired dishes.  Service has always been pleasant + knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Supporting local business is awesome!  I would like to see more restaurants like this in Mesa.  But if I have to be perfectly honest, I went for the rattlesnake/rabbit appetizer.  Parking is own-lot, and very roomy.  You get your choice between the bar area (with tables also) and the dining room area (featuring a tree).  They are well separated from each other so the type of meal you want can remain that way.  We planned to go in the 4 PMs on Sat to beat the crowd.  I like to go to restaurants when they aren't very busy.  What I forgot is people in AZ are older, and older people eat early--oh well.  It looked like the restaurant got a lot of people from the community center, so if you have an event there this would be a convenient place to go.  Even though the seniors beat us at our game, and made it a little busy, we did make it for happy hour, which is a huge bonus.  I got a couple of cocktails and they were each $2 off.  Also, they were good, and made strong.    Our food was great.  The snake/rabbit app was a teeny portion, so don't think you'll be able to order just that.  It's a thoughtful and funny concept, was presented well, and absolutely worth the trip in--I'd eat it again.  We also got the pretzels with beer-cheese dip, and they were a generous portion that you could have by itself with plenty of butter dripping off of the bread in just the right way.    The desserts were beautiful and delish! And the cheese blintzes were good, (and so lovely-looking), but I'm spoiled by the ones at Tucan Charlies' Buffet because they are served warm instead of cold, and they have a warm vanilla dipping sauce with optional warm strawberry sauce you can put over them.  If these had been warm, they would have been even better--don't get me wrong, they are still remarkable.  The tiramisu was really spectacular in presentation making us the envy of the dining room.  And it tasted yummy.  Also, really impressive, was our service.  Pretty much as soon as we got there, swarms of older people came in to eat.  And I was impressed the server didn't neglect us to hedge his tip-bets with more \"established\" customers (as serving staff usually do in that situation).  He still paid attention to us, was prompt and correct, and even took time for some small-talk.  Well done!  I couldn't afford to eat there very often, but I'd go back for cocktails OR appetizers OR dessert, but not all 3 at once.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Their sign says Happy Hour,  Went in and was told beers other than tap are full price. Only draught beer was on happy hour at $5/pint. Cold and uninviting inside bland and no music make for a boring bar scene"}
{"text":"Great place with friendly service. Unique and classy look. This place has character that's hard to find today. Locally owned...good local beer selection."}
{"text":"If you're looking for awesome food and great drinks, this is the place to go ! Fresh and delicious with outstanding service!  The chef came out and greeted us so we could thank him for his bomb dish's. And our server/bartender couldn't have been more attentive. We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The Oak Room is new to Mesa and hot.  A complete overlay of long time Mesa staple Pier D'Orleans.  It's hip, it's friendly, it's diverse and it's well worth a look.  I wasn't expecting much due to our 10:30pm arrival time. Bang! What a pleasant surprise.  We sat bar side to take in some SportsCenter and were immediately greeted by Shawn, the bar keep. His wine and Arizona craft beer selection are excellent.  The menu, diverse. This is nearly a scratch restaurant right down to the marshmallows. We had grilled cheese, tomato bisque and fries and at the same time poached lemon dill mustard sauce salmon with creamy green bean.  On top of that, S'mores for even the most critical of Brownie Scout. All were excellent.  This place will easily get 5 stars from us next go round if the atmosphere and quality remain consistent."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw the menu. Close to our house and such good choices. Unfortunately the food was awful and the service worse. My husband's food was tasteless and overcooked, mine was cold and undercooked. Total disappointment. The manger came to our table and picked up our table but we left hungry"}
{"text":"Nice to see a new restaurant near downtown Mesa. Enjoyed my lunch and the service. Nice to have the carafe of water at the table. Need to add the lobster roll to the lunch menu. Luckily, I was still able to order the lobster roll and it was delicious!!!! The dining room needs some decorating/color. Will be back."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed at this place.  I think chef mic(rowave) was working the kitchen tonight.   The vodka  shrimp pasta was horrible; tails still on all the shrimp and pasta tasted like it was out of a can and microwaved.    The service was horrible as the server seemed to not want to be bothered by us.  When I ordered my entree she rushed away while I sat there wanting a salad, although I am glad I did not order it.     My advice......RUN!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry.. not good..they need to pick fewer dishes and perfect them..mediocre at best..so sad really hoped it would be good ..four different dishes ..none great.."}
{"text":"I was not all impressed with the Oak Room. I was expecting a lot better service and food than what was given.   We had a dining group of vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores. The big plus to this restaurant is that there were options for all of us and the menu was marked well.    I ordered  the red quinoa and avocado salad. I opted for the cheese to be off the salad to make it vegan. Let me tell you, I was extremely disappointed. Luckily I ordered this dressing on the side and watch it looked very creamy and probably had milk in it. Therefore I ordered another dressing which the server said probably had milk, but didn't offer to check so I then just requested a balsamic vinegar in which they didn't even have a vinaigrette prepared. It took a slightly longer amount of time for the dressing to come out that I requested and the dressing had no flavor at all. I would've had no problem with the dressing being oil and vinegar if the salad itself had plenty of vegetables. However the salad came out with maybe two cherry tomatoes,  a little bit of quinoa, and I kid you not... about three small slices of avocado. I didn't complain because clearly there were problems in the kitchen since the food took forever to arrive.    Those with me had alcoholic beverages to drink, and those took an extremely long time to come out as well. The sad thing is that this restaurant wasn't even busy.   Although I'm disappointed in the service and the quality of food. I am impressed with the options on the menu that accommodate literally every taste. I don't usually give out two star reviews but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"This is an okay place to grab a bite before a show at the Mesa Amphitheater.  It was the pinnacle of mediocre.  Our waitress was attentive in the beginning but because sparse after that.  My quinoa salad had a lot of promise and I think they're onto something but it's incredibly bland.  The cocktail list *almost* looked really good but it seemed like the last ingredient was something super-sweet.  (I'm not personally a fan of \"sorority girl\" drinks.)  My companion ordered a bun-less burger (she is highly gluten intolerant) and her salad arrived awash in croutons.  To be fair, she didn't disclose her allergy to the server so she bears some responsibility but in this day and age, servers should pick up on such cues."}
{"text":"Horrible experience for our first visit. It sucks because their food was delicious it's a little pricey but we didn't mind. Our \"waiter\" who also was taking care of the bar could have cared less that we were there. The whole time we were there he was too busy talking it up with a couple eating at the bar to come over and see how we were doing. He didn't ask how the food was, we had to call him over because the steak didn't come out the way we had ordered it. No apology or anything. We had to grab him every-time we wanted another drink. I could understand more if it was ridiculously busy or something but it was only us, one other table and the couple at the bar. Even though the food was good, the bad service out weighed that and we won't be back. Everyone there should be getting the same good service."}
{"text":"Very refreshing place to eat. I am glad I came in. The wine was great and the the food was excellent. They have rabbit on the menu and the lady down the bar ordered it. When it came out it looked good. She said she liked it. Clean new restaurant in the heart of downtown Mesa. Gotta come back."}
{"text":"Went to the Oak Room on a Friday, made reservations in advance although really not sure we needed them. Our reservation was at 6pm. We were seated appropriately enough although our hostess decided to talk to another table instead of actually verbalizing to us where we were sitting. Once she was done chatting with the other table she gave us our menus. No biggie, service was good my challenge was the food. We ordered the cheese plate (ask what the cheeses are), not a fan of goat or blue cheese (but this was my fault for not asking). The other board with the meats was fantastic and disappeared quickly. Let's talk about the food, our server recommended the Lobster Mac and Cheese, my friends husband got it and he allowed me to take a bite. I was not impressed, underwhelmed with the flavor of it honestly. My husband got a burger and he indicated the bun was dry, the meet was slightly overcooked and I personally can say the fries were overcooked and had no flavor. My shrimp and lettuce wrap entree recommended by the server was just strange. The cream sauce and the lettuce didn't really in my opinion seem to meld together. My friend enjoyed her salad, I sort of wish I had ordered one as I felt off throughout the evening (again something about cream sauce and lettuce). With the two boards and the 4 entrees the price was around $70 a piece with tip. For the meal I got I was disappointed. No plans to return. Hoping it was just an off day for the food. I always recommend trying something yourself even with reviews."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this restaurant since they opened.  I read all of the reviews and decided to give it a chance.    They did a beautiful remodeling job and I love that they kept the oak tree from Pier de Orleans.  The tap is clean and beer fresh.  The service was nice and food was prompt.  They have the appearance and service spot on...but...the food is another matter.  My husband and I frequently eat out at various restaurants around the valley.  I don't expect huge portions but if I am going to pay $11 for chicken lollipops they better melt in my mouth....they didn't.  They basically used the same sweet chili sauce I purchase at the Asian market.    I would maybe come for a beer but eat before I got there.   The price is NOT worth the bang or lack of one!"}
{"text":"Great wine, beer and cocktail selections. But the food is the real star here. Local, fresh and delicious. To top it off we received excellent service. Can't wait to come back to try additional menu items."}
{"text":"This place was not great.  We were here with a mix of omnis and vegans. Our server was a loud obnoxious, \"bro.\"  Their vegan/vegetarian options were not that varied, limited to a few salads and lettuce wrapped veggie burger.  That isn't really a minus on them as they don't seem to advertise being vegan friendly.  What really bothered us was that when we ordered the one vegan friendly appetizer and the waiter poked fun at the choice.   He also said that brioche was vegan friendly, which while technically possible, would only probably ever be found at an all vegan restaurant.  Back to appetizers, we also ordered the scotch eggs, which were just cut in half hard-boiled eggs wrapped with bacon.  That was laughably bad and particularly infuriating because I love proper scotch eggs and was looking forward to it.  The other food seemed fine though, most everyone liked it, though there was no real theme to the menu, everything seemed random.  It really came down to the waiter, who was one of the worst we have ever had."}
{"text":"Came here after a show in downtown Mesa and had a great experience! We sat in the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers. Lots of craft beer on tap from a handful of local breweries. Good options in my opinion. My boyfriend had an old fashion with rosemary and he enjoyed it. The tacos and bacon wrapped jalapenos we're delicious!! I would recommend trying this place out for a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch on Wednesday.  We were the only people that we saw in the restaurant other than two employees.  The updating of the old restaurant space was very clean and fresh looking.  The big tree remains.  Wasn't totally sure the decorating was complete?  Service was friendly.  Lunch was mostly delicious.  I tried the hamburger with prosciutto and brie.  It was delicious.  Really really good.  The side salad though was a miss - completely wilted and soft lettuce.  My friend had the club sandwich that looked good and the fries which looked and tasted amazing!  The other big negative in my book to keep them from being able to reach 5 stars is that they don't have sweet & low.  I have to have iced tea with my lunch and would never drink it with any other sweetener.  Lucky thing to salvage the lunch that I had one in my purse."}
{"text":"Wow. And not in a good way.  My husband  and I were just here for date night with another couple.  We searched for a place near The Escape Room and thought the menu looked good and seemed like it would be a cool place.   Atmosphere:  not bad.  We were seated under the big tree. Room was not overly decorated. Have learned that a big tree in the middle of the dining area usually leads to a disappointing meal.   Food:  I ordered the salmon which was advertised as \"Salmon filet poached in white wine with a sauce made from honey, dill, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, & sour cream. Paired with Chef's vegetable.\" Ugh.  The sauce was Dijon mustard and honey.  No dill. Little if any white wine. Not good. The salmon was undercooked. The \"chef's vegetable\" was a pile of over cooked baby carrots steamed past the point of recognition, not seasoned except for a very liberal sprinkle of dried parsley.  I went into the meal starving and left the same way.   My husband ordered bruschetta boards, which turned out to be day old hoagie rolls heaped with cheap ingredients that looked like something a 17 year old boy might throw together trying to impress a girl on a first date.  Jarred pesto topped with diced salami.  A really huge slice of mozzarella topped with mushy diced tomatoes.  Melted cheddar with bacon that looked precooked.  Salmon with Brie (why?).  The draft beer he ordered was so flat he left 3/4 of it sitting on the table.  Our friends didn't make out much better.  One ordered a house salad with chicken. The chicken was missing when the food was delivered and we pointed that out immediately and the rest of us were finished eating (or picking at our food as it were) before her chicken arrived.  She also left hungry.  The service:  well....our server made some crack about us \"at least not spending another night at Applebee's\".  As if I spend any nights at Applebee's. But in all honesty, we would have had a better meal at Applebee's.  Not once were we asked how the meal was. He probably didn't ask because he knew what the answer would be.  No apologies were made for the missing chicken or the amount of time it took to get the chicken.  My husband and our friend both ordered beers (his to replace the flat one) and only one beer was delivered.   So, no I cannot recommend The Oak Room and I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"We went at 6pm on Saturday, and the place was fairly busy and not at all empty. I'm going to specifically mention a number of things other reviewers have complained about, because we saw none of them. Considering they're only been open for a little while, I'm chalking up those issues to growing pains.  As we walked in we were pleasantly greeted and led to a table in a large room with a giant faux oak tree and plain walls -- it's clear they are still decorating from the previous failed restaurant.  Menu was nicely presented with a variety of gastropub options and had clearly marked prices, options, and Gluten Free markings.  Our waitress immediately introduced herself and provided drinks.  After looking over the menu, my wife ordered the Brie and Prosciutto Burger medium well with fries, and I had the Bacon Burger medium with fries. The Bacon Burger is a mixture of beef and pork belly (that's the same cut as bacon is, btw.)  My wife has a deadly food allergy. Deadly enough she carries epi-pens with her. The waitress took careful note, and it was *clearly indicated to the kitchen on the ticket* (a big bonus, and one reason she got a very nice tip!)  Food arrived promptly, with no fuss. Both burgers looked great, and the fries, buns, pickle, and lettuce/tomato/onion were all fresh. My burger was medium, but so was my wife's. Both were flavorful and tasted good, mine felt a little charred on the outside but still had good flavor. We were quite happy with the food and decided at that point to come back.  We're looking forward to trying other menu options and we'll bring friends.  (The food gets 3 stars, and the staff's concern about my wife's allergy is worth the extra star)"}
{"text":"Their food is very good and while their menu is kind of limited but has amazing choices like pheasant, wild boar and lobster! Best lobster roll outside of Maine! Lobster Mac & Cheese is good as is Bacon Burger. We love the casual atmosphere. Service is very good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why they have anything less than 5 Stars. It's a glorified bar with glorified bar food. Some reviews seem like they went out for a $50.00 steak and are dissatisfied or disappointed with the pricing. You get what you pay for and to pay $15.00 for a charcuterie board or $15.00 for a burger with \"real\" meat is the going rate in all cities these days and the Oak Room does it right! We had the bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers which you could tell were homemade and they were delicious! We also ordered the ranch dip with veggies and it was good, ordered the poutine as well and it had one of the best gravy's we've had in town. My husband ordered a Margarita which was HUGE and delicious. I had a few glasses of wine. For dinner we had the steak which came with potatoes and bearnaise sauce which was all cooked to perfection and had great flavor. My husband ordered the burger which was presented on a piece of \"Oak,\" (cute idea) and it was delicious too! We were stuffed and had no room for dessert but we will be back. We sat in the bar at a table and the service was great. Both servers had great personalities too!"}
{"text":"Waltzed on in before a concert for a cocktail and a snack! The food and the cocktails are amazing! I asked the bartender Shawn for a shot that would go with my beer choice. Needless to say he delivered! The ambience is what you would want! It has an established vibe. I am planning on coming back for Mothers Day as their menu looks fabulous! Please check them out and support local Mesa businesses as this place is exactly what this city needs."}
{"text":"This place was incredible!!! I was dining with my parents and we arrived minutes after they opened, they were very accommodating, and we got the best seat in the house right under the tree!! We started with two beer flights, so we could pick our favorites!!! The cheese plate was amazing and we had the rattlesnake and rabbit stuffed peppers, which could not have been more delicious! For our entrees we had spicy lobster Mac and cheese, a ribeye and the spinach quinoa salad, everything was fresh, well prepared and absolutely delicious!! We probably should have stopped there... but we couldn't, we split two desserts the s'mores and the cheese blintzes ... again delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! Ordered an Ol Fashioned. Horrible! I sent it back stating they forgot the Simple Syrup. Got it back, the had added Grapefruit juice?! Bread was burned, husbands pasta was bland and the shrimp in it still had shells on and tasted frozen. My petite sirloin was excellent though! Got out ASAP!"}
{"text":"Hi all....this is my second review for this establishment, my first review was taken down for some reason but I  stand by my previous review.  This establishment is just what the area need, a fresh  view and cuisine. The food here is great and the ambiance is even better, the present owner took a stone from the rock pile and created a diamond.  It is unfortunate that other establishments in the area may feel threatened by new digs in the area, maybe they should consider a facelift for their businesses also.  We need this change in Mesa to show that we are not only great Sport fans but we can take off the sneakers and dress up to different occasions.  The Oak Room can accommodate both arenas, we are lucky to have this establishment.  My last post was taken down, I hope this one survive."}
{"text":"This place is good, but not great! It was pretty slow overall, there were only two other full tables the night we went, but everything still took quite a while. The French fries are really good and they have a pretty good beer selection, but the sandwiches weren't that good."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it would be great. We order the lobster roll and the Rabbit. I the lobster roll came with fries, all I could taste was salt and butter. I could not even finish my meal because it was too salty. The bread had way too much butter it had a doughy consistency. So I took the lobster out to eat just that and it was super buttery and salty as well. The fries were pretty salty as well. My mouth was burning from the salt. The rabbit was very tough. There was nothing wrong with service, just the quality of food was poor in my opinion. We were the only ones there at the time and received our food quickly, like within 10-15 mins if not faster. The waitress was nice. Just quality of food was not up to par."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Friday night to use our Groupon and was very disappointed.  Got there about 6pm, and there were about 10-15 people in the bar along with a small wedding rehearsal dinner party in the back room.  We were seated in the dining room with the big tree and were the only ones in there for our entire dinner.   Our waitress didn't come to greet us for at least 10 minutes; said there was a communication mixed up with the hostess.  Even after she took our drink and dinner orders, she didn't come back to check on us until she delivered our food and check. I ordered the pheasant dinner and it was really delicious.  Loved the mushroom gravy.  Hubby ordered a steak and was quite happy with his meal.  Can't recommend this place because of the terrible service.  Too bad for them, because the food was top notch.  As we were leaving, I noticed there were several dining tables in the bar.  I expect our service and the atmosphere would have been light-years better in the bar."}
{"text":"Great new fresh spot to temp your taste buds! Excellent staff and owner who looks to provide a taste well rounded experience! Looking forward to coming back and test the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting little brand new restaurant that has very, very good food despite some apparent early growing pains. The bruschetta, which comes in 4 varieties, including the classic and salami and pesto that we had, is among the best I've ever had. The clam chowder was different and filled with huge bits of clam. And the lamb burger was the best premium burger I've had in a while.  It was a little slow overall, from getting seated, to getting served, to getting our food, but not enough to prevent a return visit especially considering the place had been open for just about a week so we'll forgive a few kinks in the works... this time.  Service was friendly throughout. The prices were reasonable to slightly high but the food quality justifies it. We look forward to our next visit when I'd expect the works to run a bit more efficiently, and the food to be every bit as good."}
{"text":"First time in here today for brunch with a few friends. We sat at the bar and Cory, the owner, served us.  He's was super friendly and funny! All of our food was excellent and everyone enjoyed their adult beverages. Took a look at their dinner menu and we will definitely be back for dinner!  I highly recommend The Oak Room to everyone!"}
{"text":"Service was top notch as well as the food. Pheasant was delicious and a nice surprise find."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and wine. Loved the variety of dishes on the menu. Enjoyed the pesto pinwheel for an appetizer. The lobster mac and cheese was wonderful. Great staff and chef!"}
{"text":"I was prepared to love the place because it is near downtown Mesa Arts Center.  However, I guess it was a mistake to go on Friday afternoon.  Even though it was early it was very noisy.  The beet and spinach salad was very good.  The pineapple chicken was so-so.  However, I don't believe I've every had a meal in a fine restaurant that did not serve bread or rolls with a meal.  When asking for some I was told I could have a piece of toast for $1.50. All in all, it was not a comfortable setting.  Perhaps in another room on a weekdaynight.  However, I really can't get past the \"no dinner rolls\"."}
{"text":"I was in a rare mood... for a burger. This place makes an exceptional burger! I got the bacon burger. It may be the best burger I've ever had. I had the salad, which was very good, but my husband's fries were very tasty too. The staff was very nice and everything was perfect. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Gastropub. From Poutine to Roasted Pheasant, the menu is ecclectic and refreshing.  Bar staff is friendly and very good at talking about options and giving suggestions..   Vegan options are nice:  vegan spring rills and vegan burgers are nice options.  I personally lived seeing Bacon Wrapped Scotch Eggs and candied bacon on one of the appetizer boards.   The Barkley's Peanut Butter Porter is anazing. A hint of peanut butter cups, but a good solid porter.  The nose smells like peanut butter cups.  Would be an amazing dessert beer.  I'll be back to try other things. Dr8nk prices are average.  Food prices are a bit high, but for a unique gastronomic experience, the chef has a flair for some interesting menu options.  Portions are huge."}
{"text":"Nope. We pulled up and the parking lot was empty. That should have been our first sign but we ignored it when we looked at the reviews which were decent, ok enough for us to try it with the Groupon we already had. The ambience in the place was bland and that matched with the menu. Small which is fine but when it's a small menu and it takes you awhile to figure out what you want to eat that's never a good sign. The burger options were boring and with today's foodies that doesn't really work. O well move on and let's just try it.   I order the bacon burger and my wife gets a salad. My burger came out on a wood plank which is my second positive thing about the place after the first being the local craft beer selection. Now the bacon on this burger literally didn't even cross the meat from end to end which is beyond a shock and didn't even look ok which after a bite I took off. Then the bun was dry and breaking a part. Needless to say I ended up leaving half a burger because it was not good and I honestly was concerned with how it appeared, hoping not to get food poisoning. Will update if that does happen. My wife's salad was lame but at least the dressing was good she said.   To sum it up if this place was located in downtown Scottsdale or Tempe, somewhere with heavier traffic I don't think it would last."}
{"text":"We came in kinda late on a Friday night and this place was quite empty.  I was worried that perhaps they were getting ready to close, but lucky for us that was not the case.  Instead we were treated to a wonderful meal with excellent service in a quiet and relaxing environment.  I had the veal piccata and it was delicious! The portions are huge by the way.  This place has the most eclectic menu.  I love it when places offer exotic fare, and with items like pheasant, and rabbit on the menu this place doesn't disappoint.    I would gladly return to the Oak Room when staying at the Marriott again."}
{"text":"It's my understanding that this restaurant is brand new, and I'm aware of the growing pains that come with opening a new restaurant, but this one has many.  My friend and I stopped in on a Friday afternoon, it's not busy at all. We take a seat at the bar. The bartender informs us of the drink specials, he says wine is $5. What he doesn't explain initially is that only house wine is $5. So my friend inquires as to what their house wine is and he has no clue! He eventually finds out and brings it over to show us. We opt for something else.  Next we ask about gluten free options and if they have a gf menu. He says no but there are \"lots of gf options on the regular menu.\" After looking over the menu we see basically no gf options so not sure what he's referring to. Another bartender comes over so we ask her about the tacos to see if they are corn or flour tortillas, she doesn't know but goes to check. She also informs us that they do have gf menu but it's hand written. Um what? Needless to say we never actually see it and the tacos are indeed on flour shells. So I'm not sure if they understand what gluten free even means. Look, I don't expect every restaurant to cater to my dietary restrictions BUT I do expect them to know their own food!  To play it safe we just order a fruit and cheese board to share. When it's brought out by another server she simply sets it down and walks away. Ok I realize she's not our serve but it would be nice to know what the cheeses are since it's not listed! Finally we see the female bartender and ask her if she could explain the cheeses, which she does. But my goodness why is everything such a struggle!  So while we are eating I notice the male bartender is now sitting down at a table interviewing a young lady. I hear a man approach him and shake his hand, turns out he is the owner!!! In my head I am screaming \"You're the owner?\" The guy who didn't know the house wine or if you have a gluten free menu? Say what!! If that is the case then this place is doomed. I hope I misheard. And if he is the owner please get your act together! I have been a part of opening two brand new restaurants and it's hard work but you train people and show knowledge and enthusiasm for your business!   One last thing. There is a strange disconnect with the interior. The bar area has the whole gastropub  vibe but the other side is decorated like an old world Italian trattoria. Strange."}
{"text":"This was our third time trying this place.  We will never return. I ordered the shrimp & scallop lettuce wraps. The menu states that they are served with butter lettuce. They arrived with iceberg lettuce & no explanation about substitution. The mixture was not chopped evenly, all seafood pieces were pulverized with the odd huge chunk of bacon. The mixture was also watery & with little flavor. I didn't eat more than two bites. The waitress noticed but instead of removing it from our check she offered a free dessert. Why would I want more bad food? Or why would I want dessert when I hadn't eaten dinner? My husband got the lobster Mac & cheese. The sauce was watery & broken & the dish had way too much cayenne. This place is close to home & we wish it were worthy of our patronage. It's not. Don't waste your time. I came home & ate day old cold pizza & was more satisfied."}
{"text":"Unfortunately should have known better with an empty parking lot on a saturday night. Ordered steak medium and it came out like shoe leather. Sent it back and the second one was raw and frozen in the middle. Was hoping to like this place but it is horrible. On a good note the waitress was very good, attentive and kind. Too bad, central Mesa needs good restaurants!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for Valentine's Day. We were basically ignored by the hostess, an older woman w short greying hair. I had to physically get in her way so she would make eye contact w me. I got eye contact but no 'Hi, we will be with you shortly' or anything to that effect. We decided to sit at the bar so we would get served. Asked the bartender to put on the olympics. He mentions how as a kid he used to sit around the tv and watch it. Cool. We wanted to do just that. Nope. Not yet. He did proceed to bad mouth the wait staff to us and talk about how he was dating a girl 15 yrs his junior. Your on the side of the bar that doesn't need to spill ur guts to the customer. Hi five bud now can we watch the Olympic s??? It's on 220 he says, he next time we ask him to put it on, he does. So the hostess now comes up to us as we are having drinks and appys to ask if we had a reservation??? First u won't acknowledge us and now u interrupt our dinner?!! Didn't matter tho....the food was horrible, cold and overpriced. Don't go."}
{"text":"Not impressed and will NOT be going back. We got the vegan rolls as an appetizer and they brought them out while they were still FROZEN inside. Next we ordered cocktails and one had a black BUG stuck in the straw. THEN the vodka shrimp pasta had some hard stick or jagged bone in it...   We complained and waiters did not seem to care or bother at all, however they were so kind to reheat our vegan rolls to melt the ice.    P.S. - We tried to go there a few months back during business hours and the restaurant was not even open. We will not be giving them a 3rd chance."}
{"text":"Wonderful new find in Mesa! I have had consistently great experiences every time I've visited here so far: from a quiet beer in the bar area while getting some evening work done to this evening, when The Oak Room provided a fantastic birthday dinner (without a reservation). The drinks are exceptional, both beer/wine list and cocktails, and you can truly tell that so much of the food is made from scratch. They even cheerfully brought out off-menu plain pasta and freshly steamed veggies for my kids exactly as I asked, which worked better for us than any kid's menu usually does. Service is friendly and attentive, atmosphere is tranquil, and you NEED to get the Brewer's S'mores. :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent and the beer was just as good. Well worth the visit. Great atmosphere Mr I highly recommend for good food and good beer. Once again eat there and the meal was fabulous! Definitely go for great food. Plus celebrities and baseball people like it."}
{"text":"4 of us lunched here this week and it was pretty sad.  Nice new decor but very empty walls.    Asked server what the Soup was today,  we were told 3 days ago it was Veggies and Rice when she worked last so she went and checked with the chef.  Today its French Onion and we were all excited.  3 of us ordered the shrimp & scallop lettuce wraps and the French Onion soup, which is my all time favorite soup.  A little while later server returned to tell us the soup was still the veggie and rice, no French Onion!  Oh, that didn't sit well so none of us had the soup.  When the 3 orders of lettuce wraps arrived 2 were nice portions and one was what they scraped out of the pan and the lettuce was small pieces you couldn't wrap anything in!  The shrimp hardly covered the bottom of the boat....one of our party had the grilled cheese and it was the only good thing at the table. We also had a veggie tray with avocado dip.   Veggies were limp and the dip a gray-brown color....certainly not fresh. Then the topper was we got charged the dinner price for our scant lunch-$4.more . They fixed this after we told them about it.  Sure hope they can prove."}
{"text":"Nope, No, Never again. Save your money!   My friends I visited this place before a night out at the Escape Room close by. It was Saturday night around 6 pm and the place was EMPTY, we were the only people in there. Ignoring that red flag we decided to go in. We had a larger party and  3 people in my party ordered the steak (all ordered med) and it came out super well done. The cocktails that were ordered were also off and tasted funny. When we ordered drinks we got something \"similar\" but never told they didn't have the item that was to be included in the drink. To me it was just a waste of money.  I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff, fantastic bar. BUT THE FOOD. The lobster Mac and cheese... so much yes. The appetizer menu as a whole is an exercise in self restraint. This place is why we CAN have nice things in Mesa."}
{"text":"We came to the oak room specifically for my friend to try the walleye.  We didn't expect much as we have tried several other places but boy were we pleasantly surprised!    We each started off with soup, mine was tomato bisque while my friend had cream of chicken.  Both were exceptional!   My friend preferred the walleye and I had the salmon.   He said his was the best walleye he has had in a long time and in this part of the country ever.  My salmon was absolutely perfect.  It was moist and tasty!   We both oredered the oak room ale which was pleasant and we finished off with the s'mores which was amazing!   We will definitely be returning to the oak room again!  They far exceeded. Our expectations.   I look forward to trying some of the more unique menu items!"}
{"text":"GREAT FIND IN DOWNTOWN MESA!   Come to AZ on business and always excited to find a great local restaurant. The Oak Room is a locally owned Gastropub with great food and service. Jimmy the bartender was welcoming and friendly, and bar service was prompt and friendly. He offered us a taste of several local brews. Nice time find a place that promotes local beer!   After an appetizer of cheese curds (\"slap your momma good\") we moved on to dinner. The service continued to be excellent. Entrees were delicious and beautifully presented.   The owner Corey was walking around ensuring the clientele was happy and satisfied with their dining experience. All in all, we were not only impressed but found our new \"local\" in Mesa. Check it out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for dinner in downtown Mesa. The food is great, the people are very good too. This is a veteran owned restaurant using local Arizona produce. My wife and I ate here before going to the Mesa Arts Center and loved the food and the service. These are great people, please keep them busy.  I had the shrimp stuffed with crab, my wife had the chicken marsala, both were excellent. We can't wait to go back and try more things here."}
{"text":"Such a unique and beautiful experience. The food was delicious and unlike anything I've ever tried. The bartender was very friendly, made us laugh and was attentive. The cocktails were also spectacular and different. I also loved he atmosphere; there is an oak tree in the restaurant! This is a really laid back and relaxing restaurant for a special occasion, quick lunch or romantic dinner. Great family atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. What else can I say? The menu was filled with so many amazing options it took me forever to pick, so I'll definitely be back to try more! A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I would be shocked if this restaurant makes it 6 months.   I'll start by saying the burgers are decent, albeit a little slow out of the kitchen. That's about all I can say that's positive.   A few of the issues: * The bartenders are seriously undertrained and under managed: No one cleans the bar top or mixing containers, \"Jack rocks\" is served with Coke, and I saw them pour alcohol for a minor (story below). * They're disorganized. No one will seat you, soup does not include a spoon, food arrives at random intervals, no drinks get refilled, and the bill does not come. But there is staff everywhere.  * Customers are frustrated. In the space of 10 minutes, people from 3 different tables demanded to see a manager within our earshot (2 of whom stomped away). * The menu is poorly put-together, with multiple spelling errors and severe ingredient confusion. (The bacon burger has no bacon--but it does come with other non-bacon pork toppings.)  I'll stop rather than belabor the list of challenges. We won't be back.   Story: A waitress walked behind the bar to ask for cherry syrup to add to a soda for \"a little girl.\" The three bartenders consulted with each other, agreed on deKuyper's Razzmatazz Raspberry Liqueur and POURED IT! The father was standing nearby trying to get a bar menu, and he called out the error, insisting that it was alcohol (it is). The three bartenders and the waitress all promised that \"it's just flavoring\" and they \"use it in Shirley Temples.\" No one tried to read the bottle. Then the waitress delivered the drink. (Eep!) A few minutes and an online search later, and dad was back at the bar, furious. To dad's credit, he and the family left the restaurant without a scene."}
{"text":"The staff here is very welcoming and provides great service.Our group of 8 met there before visiting the Escape Rooms Mesa, which is very close by.  This is also a convenient spot for meeting before or after events at the Mesa Arts Center.   The menu is very creative  I enjoyed the pork belly and spinach sandwich and fries.  The hamburgers were also very good.  Another of our party really enjoyed her Cubano sandwich.  They have a nice selection of local brews on tap.  They also have a brunch menu that we plan to check out on our next visit.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped by late afternoon not really busy. It started filling up later. This is a fun nice and clean dare I say hip place to checkout. The cheese curds rocked. I made up my own burger and it was so freaking amazing. I will definitely get it again and again.  The server Dominique told us they make there own marshmallows so we had to try the s'more dessert. It was wonderful as was the service!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time on a Friday night. They weren't busy. Took about 15 minutes to just order drinks. The water was so nasty that I sent mine back thinking it was a dirty glass. Nope. I ordered a sprite instead. Couldn't get anyone to refill although we asked a couple of people. Our shrimp dishes took an hour to come out and the shrimp was overcooked. I cannot even really give it 1 star"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it forced me to make my first review. Very unsatisfied with the food and especially for the price. $10 apps for frozen fried food. Pork belly tacos, asked for salsa/hot sauce and they don't have any. They came with a lime that I was unable to get a single drop out of. Also tried their house Burger  ordered with medium doneness but arrived well done and believe it was a frozen patty. To top off the Burger there was what seemed to be scrap lettuce and a top of a tomato core included and that's it, soooo dry! This place deserves to be on Restraunt Impossible to get the whole menu revamped.   Sat ourselves and were the only patrons at the bar area. Once an employee came from the back kitchen area we ordered drinks and food. Once served they were gone and did not return until we were done and ready to pay with our card already out and waiting, I almost shouted to get their attention. Once our card was run they went straight back to the kitchen area. We paid our bill and as we are getting up to leave we are asked by another employee coming from another room if we need anything? Way too late! Avoid this establishment for your own palette and wallet."}
{"text":"Great experience eating dinner here as part of a large group. The staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly. The server was extremely helpful, patient, and efficient. I loved the pretzel rolls and lobster mac and cheese. Nice beer and wine selection and pricing. I definitely would return."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend from out-of-town.  Good food, good service, even on busy prom night!  (We didn't realize until we got there--this place is right next to a high school.)  I would recommend the delicious lobster mac n cheese, but be warned, they're not lying when they say it's spicy!"}
{"text":"Gotta give mad props to The Oak Room team for a massive group dinner I was part of recently (like 40 people). My friend who organizes it swears by their menu up and down, he loves coming here regularly. We pretty much took up the entire private dining area due to our quantity. The reservation was made with plenty of time before the date and he was reassured a few times by the owner that they would be fine to take our group. Bunch of us were mentally prepared for the patience it would take to eat, drink, be merry and cash out. And for the most part it worked out well!  There wasn't a hostess to greet but luckily my friend gave us directions ahead so once we arrived so we knew where to go. The big faux oak tree in the middle of the room is really pretty!   Couple of us went to the bar to get drinks before a majority of the group went to overwhelm the bar. Extensive wine and beer list, a fairly short list of speciality house drinks with an emphasis on bourbon. I tried both the Oak Room Millionaire and the House Old Fashioned, they both were nothing too special IMO. The speciality drinks were supposed to be $2 off for the night but I didn't receive the discount, oh well.   Once everyone sat is when a bit of madness began. In a 10-minute span of all sitting down and ordering drinks, both of our waiters up and left. Like flat out, one due to some PTSD I was later told, the other idk why. But how of those employees to do that to the restaurant when they were forewarned ahead of time. As a result, the owner and a bartender took care of us for the rest of the night and they did an absolute great job given the circumstances, absolutely deserving of all the tips.   I was shocked at how quickly the food came out despite the sheer amount ordered, and how precise everything was (very few issues). My pretzel sticks and beer cheese were delicious, but the salmon (vetted by the our waitress as the #1 seafood dish) needed more to the plate for what I ordered. Broccolini, salmon, and the honey glaze dressing for $21, but my friends who ordered steak got a lot more bang for their buck. I can't put my finger on what was off about my salmon. Luckily one of my friends had some leftover salad so I was able to leave not as hungry.  I'm definitely willing to come again and try them with far less people. It's just the food and drinks weren't terribly impressive overall. Cute spot though!"}
{"text":"Our server completely forgot to put in two of our dishes (party of 6). All the other food came, and some time went by before the mistake was even noticed and we received a half-hearted apology. Also, two people at the table ordered bruchetta which comes with two different types and those were mixed up. Half of my bruschetta was down at the other end of the table on some one else's plate and half of theirs on mine. The food we had was great but the service was terrible. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful entrees.  I wasn't overly impressed with the deserts though but the entrees were really amazing and prepared perfectly.  Absolutely will come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the hours of this place since I'm always up late. The food is also a plus."}
{"text":"Summary: Complete and utter clusterfarkle.  First off, to the recent reviewer who had a great experience - glad it went well for you. Yes, the place is new, and yes, new places have teething pains. I get all that. But to suggest that we merely \"sat there\" and then wrote \"crappy reviews\" is off-base. On the way out the door, we did speak with a manager briefly, and expressed our displeasure. The \"crappy reviews\" are genuine and sincere, and were earned.  We witnessed and overheard the other patron whose child was given alcohol have his entire exchange with the manager and staff. It was absolutely appalling. Kudos to the gentleman for containing his rage and leaving quietly. A lesser man might have gone postal on these people. We experienced dreadful service - multiple bartenders ignoring us as well as other patrons. I had a \"bacon burger\" with Swiss cheese, that had neither bacon nor any cheese on it. It had some sort of pork product on top of the beef patty, but it certainly wasn't bacon - and the cheese was apparently just forgotten. The burger itself, ordered medium, was cooked to death. My first cocktail was made incorrectly, and I had a heck of a time even getting someone's attention later to order a second one. My girl's drink sat empty for a good 10 minutes as various bar employees walked right past without offering to refill it. I watched as a new customer entered, was thoroughly confused by the entryway with no host/hostess or signage indicating how to get seated, get ignored by a bartender who was about 10 feet in front of him but refused to look up and acknowledge him. We witnessed 2-3 other people request to speak to a manager about whatever mishap they were dealing with. It was a disastrous night all around.  I sincerely hope that ownership addresses these issues and gets on the right track. We really try to support local non-chain businesses like this and want to see them succeed. There were clearly some serious training issues and a lack of leadership that evening. I'm willing to give them another shot."}
{"text":"This was really a great experience. Our good was delivered very quickly. We ordered the special, fish and chips,  but plan to go back and try some of the other yummy things on the menu.    After we finished dinner,  we hopped over to the bar.  My husband ordered dessert. At the urging of Ari, he had the brewer's Smores. I had a specially made sangria.   It was really a great experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here, maybe our last too... We arrived at dinner time and were the second table in the entire place. The waitress was the wife of the chef, so that may explain why the service was not up to par.  The prices and food were commiserate with portions and the quality was good. We had to ask her for things, remind her of who ordered what and she spent an inordinate amount of time visiting with other wait staff.   If the service wasn't so mediocre I would return. But there are so many places with great food and good service!"}
{"text":"I like that the menu here has some very inventive choices - like scotch eggs, rabbit, wild boar sloppy joes... I ordered the wild boar sloppy joes. They tasted just like regular sloppy joes actually. The pretzel bun was delicious. My only dislike was that the sauce was a bit too salty. The fries were delicious!  Everyone else also enjoyed their dinner. My friend said the rabbit was good although a little difficult to get off the bone. My boyfriend enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese and said there was the perfect amount of lobster in it.   I also liked that they had the option to get 4 samplers of beer for $12. I enjoyed the prickly pear cider.  I would probably come here again if I was on that side of town.  If I had one suggestion it would be to work on the decor of the back room where the tree is. The white walls and lighting made it feel a little sparse. I think slightly dimmer lighting and candles and more lanterns in the tree would create a nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place! A gastropub in downtown Mesa?? YES, PLEASE!Unfortunately, it was really bad. The wine and beer list was great!  The food.....not so great.  We ordered the Pub Board (really could have used some cheese), the only thing great about it was the bread.  The meat was so chewy that most of it ended up in my napkin.  We then had the bruschetta board . It was probably worse. Their idea of bruschetta is a plain white roll (probably from Safeway) with what was supposed to be duck confit , brie, apple and pickled lemon, which was really maybe some sort of brie mixed with mayo and a fresh lemon slice on top and unchewable duck.  The salmon 'bruschetta' was disgusting, again some sort of ricotta/mayo mixture with salmon from Safeway. So, so disappointed and I left hungry.  I do have to say that the hostess was lovely, our server was wonderful and the 'food' was served quickly."}
{"text":"Went here for a paint nite event. Decided to have dinner and drinks beforehand. The food was not good at all and way overpriced. The lobster Mac and cheese was too spicy and barely any lobster. No flavor beside spice. The poutine and the pineapple pepper chicken both were bland! The happy hour drinks did not get discounted, and the bartender was kind of rude with his snide comments. Overall not impressed with this place at all. There would have been no guests if it weren't for paint nite. I'll never come back. Save your time and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start. Everything from the server, to the ambiance/decor, to the food was  very disappointing. Steak was way over cooked, second one was barely rare, fatty flavorless. Shrimp were over cooed and rubbery. The entire experience was bad."}
{"text":"This could possibly be the worst dining experience of my life. We went there this evening for Valentine's Day dinner as this was one of only a couple places that had reservations left because of my last-minute planning. We were seated very soon after arrival so I thought things would go well. Immediately we discovered that they had a fixed menu with limited options for the evening but there seem to be decent choices so that turned out okay. We then ordered a margarita, a water, and a Shirley Temple. The water and Shirley Temple came about 10 minutes later and another 25 minutes so 35 minutes total for the margarita to show up. At this point we had already stopped the manager wants to share our displeasure. During this time we had also over her two other tables very upset about their experience. The table next to us said they had waited an hour and 10 minutes for their food and we're leaving because they still had not seen it. Once we got our food I found that my ribeye medium was cooked super rare and her medium rare filet was cooked medium well. We pointed this out to our server once we could stop him and he told us that there were no more fillets available. Keep in mind a dinner for two on this small menu was $47 per person. After flagging down the manager for a second time he said he would go ahead and take care of the problem on the bill and then returned 10 minutes later with the revised bill in hand. The Shirley Temple was $3, 2 Margaritas totaled $26, and two meals that we couldn't eat all totaled $90 now. The place was not overly crowded and in total we witnessed at least eight tables complain to the manager or just walk out. We even had someone from five tables away come over and ask if they could borrow our salt that I had to ask for specifically because there were not salt or pepper shakers on the tables even. Then when they brought me the salt and pepper shakers they were only a quarter of the way full, a bit tacky for a restaurant that labels itself fine dining.  Oh and when they finally brought the main course they dropped the food without taking any of the appetizer plates so the table was a wreck. As they were walking away i asked if thru ciuld remove the old plates and they said sure like I was making an unreasonable request. Never in a million years would I allow anyone I care about to spend a dollar at this shame of a restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is very pretty for the inside that's why I went there.  I went there on a Friday night around 11 pm and they were not serving dinner  anymore.  They were serving some dishes though and I got the kale Cesar salad.  I know to start with that name is weird right ?  Well, it was. I love salads and kale but this one was awful. I feel sorry by saying it but I have to.  I mean the service was very nice and prices but the salad it self stink literally stink like horse food/ shit.  I couldn't eat it ... Believe me I tried maybe the kale was bad or the other greens I don't know but I know kale doesn't smell bad as some people saids.  I love kale so to me it was weird the smell of. Is salad."}
