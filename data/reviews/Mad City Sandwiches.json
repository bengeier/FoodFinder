{"text":"Just had the Wednesday special which is a corn beef ruben and it was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Very high quality ingredients and friendly service.  As this was my first visit I played it safe with a club sandwich, turkey, ham and bacon.  Pretty darn good.  I am a little puzzled that people mentioned the sandwich to be small, mine was a considerable size and I could have easily saved half of it for later.  I look forward to a return visit as I think a meatball or Cuban could really be awesome.  They even have a salad bar!"}
{"text":"Had the special pulled pork nachos, delicious, also had the mad city grilled cheese, also great, service was quick and staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is right down the road from my office, so I've eaten here several times out of sheer convenience.

It's ok. Most of the staff is helpful and friendly but I've gotten attitude a couple times when my order was incorrect. I would agree with other reviews that it is a bit pricey for what you get. 

They do offer local meats - jerky, meat sticks, a plethora of brat flavors, which is a nice addition. Just recently bought several of the brats and they were great!

In a town littered with delicious sandwich shops, their location will get them by."}
{"text":"I've been spoiled, living right next to La Bamba and Sliced and not far from Itzza and McGee's.

I'm moving to a new place on the east side.  My dad was helping me move a few things and watched lunch.  Asked him what he wanted, he said a burger or sandwich.  That BBQ Joint Was closed so I was probably going to take him to McGee's (double cheeseburger and fries for $5, anyone?!) but literally within blocks of my new place we passed a sign that said \"Mad City Sandwiches\".  We MUST try this, I said!  This could be my new haunt!

I go in and the menu looks promising.  Lots of options and apparently they smoke the meat on site.  I go with a Cuban, Black Bean & Sausage Soup, and Bacon Ranch Pasta.  My dad goes with the special (Pulled Pork Nachos) and the same soup.

Unfortunately this is where my excitement ended.  It wasnt that the food wasnt GOOD, it was solidly good, but it wasnt exceptional, and I either needed lower prices, bigger portions, or better quality.

I tried the black bean and sausage soup.  Other than the addition of the sausage, it didnt seem different than black bean soup available anywhere.  I added a little hot sauce to mine which it needed for my preferences.  I enjoyed it but it's nothing I would go back for.  The small cup was $3, serve yourself.

The Bacon Ranch Pasta was really flavorful and creamy, and a decent portion size for $2, but I didnt see or taste any bacon at all.

My dad's nachos . . . put it this way.  The only cheese was shredded cheese sprinkled on top and it wasnt even melted.  The pulled pork was dry and lacking flavor.  It seemed like something I could have thrown together at home and I'm NOT a good cook.  Definitely not worth the $7-8

My Cuban was also $7-8, and it was the size of a normal small sandwich you might make at home with Wonderbread (but Panini style).  It had the same pulled pork, which was again pretty dry and flavorless.  I mostly tasted the bread (which was good), pickles, and mustard.

Again, I might expect this caliber of sandwich (and sides) from a place like Sliced, which charges $3-5, but for $8 sandwiches I'll go to BBQ joint and be very, very happy."}
{"text":"For me, this shop works for once or maybe twice in a week.

Pros:  it is convenient to my work.  Quick service for take out.  My sandwiches and portions have been plenty large.  Most everything has been pretty darn good.  They have specials that will include chips and a soda.

Cons:  the price.  You will drop a minimum of $7.50 for a whole sandwich, no sides, no soda.

I have liked most everything I have ordered including, their chicken salad, meatloaf sandwich (a special), and a few others.  I did not like the steak and cheese (it was not grilled...more like a hot beef sandwich).

I will continue to go....a MacDonald's value meal costs over six bucks most often, so I would rather eat a little healthier and give to the local business."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place on a Friday 1:02p.m. person behind counter tells me we`re closed really menu says  you`re open till 3 we close at 1 while he`s  making a sandwich and I said is that mean you`re not going to make me a sandwich we`re closed. I`m sure it Wouldn`t have been hard to explain why closed at 1 instead of 3 or just make me a Italian beef I will never stop in again"}
{"text":"Happy to see a new sandwich joint open up close to home. 

It appears that Mad city is owned by someone that owns a meat market! North Oak Meats?? Anyways, it was good to see them serving high quality meats. I ordered the mad city sandwich....what a bummer the first bite was! Bread was so very, very average. The amount of meat they put on the sub was disappointing to say the least. Add some more meat... I guess I didn't know I was ordering a sub roll with A Slice of meat on it, but in all seriousness. There were like 3 slices of meat on it, but not really. I also ordered a bacon ranch pasta salad.. Once again, average. 


Anywho, I will go back and try a hot sandwich as they looked pretty good. I want this place to do well! Stay tuned for an updated review. 

Did I mention how little meat there was on that sub?! 

Update- I will keep my rating the same. I had better food this time, but the service is so disjointed. They ask for your name when they take your order, but then they just yell out the sandwich name....um yeah, I'm pretty sure there are 4 other people that ordered the same sandwich. There was a couple that was waiting as they gave their sandwich away two times!! Hopefully they can iron out their production line. 

Good luck to this place."}
{"text":"This is an unassuming location just down a few blocks from Subway on Plfaum. I'll start by saying that my chicken salad sandwich was good. However, I apparently ordered a 1/2 sandwich and bag of chips for $8. It's my fault for reading the menu incorrectly but my disappointment could easily be seen when I was handed my miniature-sized lunch.

I'll give Mad City a second chance but I expect a lot more for $8."}
{"text":"One of smallest sandwiches I've ever had at a restaurant and all for 8.00! Skimpy and bland. Terrible. NEVER will go back."}
