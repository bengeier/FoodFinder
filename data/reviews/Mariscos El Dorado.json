{"text":"Best seafood in town period! Really fresh seafood, u have to try there aguachiles there amazing."}
{"text":"5 star on taste, flavor and authenticity. Generous portions  4 star on staff-friendly but lacking something  Can't quiet put my finger on it  3 star on the location. The restaurant needs a face lift   Aguachiles  Verde's de camaron y pulpo (shrimp/octopus) -are very spicy be prepared to dunk your tongue in a big glass of Horchata . I supposed you can ask for them less spicy but then how are you living on the edge?   Shrimp Ceviche - are very fresh. Good flavor  Oysters- meaty. were fresh and very clean But needed some chilling. Make sure to ask for them extra cold. Ask them to  serve it over ice cubes  Pacifico Mucheladas are a MUST. One of the very few places that I can say that they know what they are doing. Perrrrrfection   Horchata- is good. Not too sweet."}
{"text":"La comida esta muy buena. Las cerveza helada como debe de estar! Bien atentos. Olvidate"}
{"text":"Omg this place is so good they have a  new twist to a beer soo good  instead of salsa and chips they serve you ceviche with crackers."}
{"text":"Me encanto la comida y como nos atendieron, llegando te dan un plato de ceviche para empezar para botana, mi esposo y yo los quedamos satisfecho, esta un poco caro pero la comida vale la pena."}
{"text":"My wife and I are always on the lookout for what I would call great under the radar restaurants, and I had been wanting to try Mariscos El Dorado for quite sometime. I had read some revues and they made it look promising. As it turned out, we were in for a treat. First, if you are expecting fancy, this is not it. the atmosphere is simple and understated. It is a large clean room with several tables, and a karaoke lounge to one side. Thankfully there was none of that when we went, but instead, they were playing great Mexican music. The service was very good, and prompt, and our waitress was very friendly. They started with tostada shells which we broke up and used as chips. Along with this came two dipping plates. the first was a plate of Swordfish Ceviche, that was absolutely delicious. The second plate was Habenero Pico De Gallo. And I was warned ahead of time that it was HOT. Being raised in the southwest, I have loved spicy food my whole life. Usually when a waitress tells me something is hot, it is nowhere near hot enough. This time I only had two bites and was very satisfied. If you don't like very hot spicy food DO NOT eat this. I however found it delicious. For dinner I had the Camarones A La Diabla. It had a wonderful kick, and went very well with a cold Negro Modelo. My wife (a little more of a tenderfoot) Had the Camarones Al Ajo (Garlic Shrimp). both dishes left us very satisfied, and the portions were large enough that we finished them for lunch the next day. All in all, I would highly recommend this for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Mariscos El Dorado was AMAZING! They're mixed ceviche was fresh and delicious. The portions are huge and the service is excellent. My fiancé and I are huge mariscos fans and this place has definitely surpassed our expectations. We felt like we were in Mexico, especially with the great background music. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Muy mal servicio por parte de la mesera y la comida se tardó 45 minutos no llego nos venimos porque esperamos una hora no llego ni la comida y la mesera nunca llegó para preguntar si todo estaba bien no lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Loved their michelada (it's like a Bloody Mary) ceviche and oysters! Service was also great!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place for Mariscos and found it here. The ceviche was one of the best I've tried. (I'm picky when it comes to ceviche) I asked for the raw style and it was fresh and delicious. I also had Langostinos garlic flavored. That was off the hook!!! Fresh and good size Langostinos. It was definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, fresh seafood Mexican style. Staff is friendly food is great. Try the molcajete if you love mixed seafood. Empanadas are great filled with shrimp, wow, their cervezas preparadas come with cucumber, jicamaand orange, sounds odd but it's delicious."}
{"text":"best fish and shrimp tacos i've ever had... great delicious food, can't wait to go on a weekend night and enjoy the live mexican conjunto...   aqui se preparan los mejores tacos de  camaron y pescado ... musica en vivo los fines de semana y buen servicio."}
{"text":"Very entertainment place , I love the karaoke and the entertainment person that singing when i was there !!!! Was awesome"}
{"text":"Despues de1 hora buscando un buen lugar de mariscos, finalmente nos decidimos llegar aqui, mirar las puertas abiertas nos dio un sentido de invitacion a entrar, casi nos ibamos porque la licencia de vender cerveza esta en proceso y mariscos sin cerveza pues como que no, pero la señora Maria que nos atendio mucho mejor que si estuvieramos en casa, nos aseguro que la comida estaba hecha como en casa y sabrosa y decidimos quedarnos, para nuestra sorpresa los aguachile verdes riquisimos, unas empanaditas de camaron riquisimas, y nos prepararon para empezar un rico juguito de camaron calientito, definitivamente regresaremos pronto a probar otros platillos, Estilo Casero y Nayarita. Muy recomendable, los haran sentir como en casa."}
{"text":"When they sit you, they give you ceviche for appetizer with very nice and spicy salsa. The location is a little hidden but not too difficult to spot if you are looking fkr it. The staff is very nice, the chef comes and checks to see how you like. will definitely come here again when im in the area. i recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the first time coming to this place and we really liked it. We came back the second day for the shrimp cocktail and campechana and both were really good. Great food"}
{"text":"la verdad no se por que tienen 4.5 estrellas donde no se merecen ni dos primero la salsa que arriman es como que la haigan cambiado de mesa y después los platillos no los tienen completos dicen sorry no tenemos ni arros ni frijoles como te ban a dar un plato de camarones a la diabla con ensalada y papas fritas se supone que es restaurant mexicano y si quisiera papas boy a mcdonal's."}
{"text":"Giving two stars is a generous thing to do.. this place is understaffed and what is slower than slow?? \"Mariscos el dorado\". Food is overpriced and the waitress was always forgetful... im at the restaurant still and i still havent received my crackers.... my niece even got a hair on her food... i really think we are all going to walk out right now... this place prefers preforming with their karaoke than serving paying customers we are a group of 8 and we all agree we will never come again."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is fresh and super tasty. Honestly I hadn't ate seafood like this in a while. They are a bit pricey but worth it. Service is good too. And I guess on the weekends they have a Dj and stuff. Sounds fun."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I love it more every time I visit. The staff is very nice and helpful and the food is amazing!!! I love the shrimp empanadas and even the chips and salsa are bomb! I recommended anyone to try this place. I anxiously await to visit again. Thank you to the staff for making each visit awesome!"}
{"text":"After some thought about trying a Different Mexican seafood place and being recommended by a friend to try El Dorado. I decided to stop by on a weekday. The place looks clean, the parking lot is very small and the service was okay. I was greeted with some type of fish tostada (courtesy). I ordered the shrimp tostada, in real life it looks a lot smaller that the picture in the menu. Then I tried the pulpos in salsa Nayarit, I wasn't impressed by its flavor and presentation.  I might give it another try in the future. Overall it didn't live to my first visit expectations..."}
{"text":"YES!!!!!! FINALLY I have found a great, no frills delicious Mexican Seafood place in LV!!~ SO HAPPPPY!!!  After scouring Yelp reviews, we decided to go with some friends to try Mariscos out. So glad we did!!! IT is a bit of a dive, in the best possible way. And the food was fantastic!  We started with fresh guacamole for the table, so good! Great flavor, definitely fresh! I had the Shrimp and Octopus cocktail. Tons of flavor, super fresh and decent size shrimp, not those tiny annoying little shrimp. (right? no one likes those little shrimps!)  Everyone else at the table loved their food and said they would definitely go back! The comments were about great flavor, and they loved the rice too!!   The service was awesome!  The ONLY downfall was the music, that started 1/2 way into our meal was SO LOUD. I know, I feel like such a gringo! I know this is part of the culture, but to see a little kid at another table pressing his hands over his ears makes me think I am not the ONLY one who found this a bit excessive in volume. But that is my ONLY tiny complaint. Not bad right??  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my friends engagement. We ordered the seafood platter that had all fresh seafood of shrimp and perfectly cook pieces of octopus (not the overlooked, rubbery and hard octopus you find at a lot of places). We also had some great shrimp tacos. Oysters we had were very meaty as well. Excellent service as well just added to the experience."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Prices were a bit higher than I expected. Most entrees were around $18. Lots of food. We did have a bit of a language barrier since ordering beer in Spanish is the extent of our fluency. The ceviche instead of chips and salsa was very nice indeed. The salsa served with it was smoking hot, but delicious. The portions were very generous and we were not able to finish our meals. Shrimp diabla and octopus diabla were our entrees."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. Everytime we go they never have what we want to order. They give you a certain appetizer one day and something else another. its inconsistent and annoying. Cash only. I never unserstand why businesses do that there losing money no one wants to drive to the bank before going to eat. Lastly service is horrible, ladies have no sense of customer service. I feel uncomfortable asking for anything always feels like im bothering."}
{"text":"The service here was so terrible that everyone in my party was extremely annoyed. They took so long to bring our check that we seriously considered walking out without paying (we had already asked the server for our check). The food was good but nothing impressive. Overall I will not be eating here again. Oh and they have this \"club\" attached to the restaurant and it plays this obnoxiously loud music. Yeah, no thanks."}
{"text":"My friends and I were driving by spotted this place. Sat down and our waitress lizeth took care of like if we're vip's food was amazing my friend had shrimp fajitas that were on point I had fish tacos wow were to die for I recommend this place for any out of towner or local"}
{"text":"Almost exclusively seafood.  And somewhat expensive.  But the best shrimp taco I've ever had.  As my go-to lunch or light dinner, I've had many shrimp tacos in many places, including several times in the Baja."}
{"text":"This is an excellent example if a true good quality Mexican sea food restaurant.  I haven't had better sea food in the Las Vegas area, it is fresh and quality. The ambiance of the restaurant is very much Mexico. If you don't like that, which I do but I do."}
{"text":"Omg!! The best mexican seafood ever!! I am from mexico and finding this restaurant was the beat thing ever the food is delishus!!"}
{"text":"My favorite seafood place. The food is always great. Service is good and they are all very nice. It's a must for seafood. Better than other places that get a lot of hype."}
{"text":"if you want to have the best seafood in town got  to Mariscos El Dorado  great ceviche and the lobster is out of this world, once you eat there you will go back  clean place, good music, great cold beers cheladas and just all you you expect from a great see food restaurant 100% MEXICAN SEAFOOD ESTILO NAYARIT, IS THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Nice,service extremely fresh food, nicely cook, nice presentation? The waitress are fast! And pretty! If you came to Las Vegas and want good sea food this would be a good option!"}
{"text":"We waited for 30 mins until we were able to order. People that came in 20 after us got to order first. And then when they finally came to take our order they didn't have what we wanted. I'm not a sea food person but my boyfriend is, I only went for him to find out they didn't even have what they had on the menu for non-sea food."}
{"text":"We tried different dishes and everything was really good. Service was fast and the food had a great taste. I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We had lunch at this restaurant the day after Christmas this year and everything we ordered was very good. We had ceviche with tostadas, coctel de camaron, camarones aguachiles, caldo 7 mares, caldo de camaron, and a variety of kids menu items.  As you can imagine, our party was pretty big, and the waitresses did an awesome job at accommodating us and providing us with everything we needed.  Next time you're looking for a Mariscos Restaurant, stop by here...they will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Just a very awful experience eating here !!  We were in Vegas for the weekend   We were craving some seafood for the cruda!!  But man , 1st the service was too slow ..I only saw one server working and a guy that would just pop out of nowhere t o help out.  It took about a hr for our food to finally get to our table . I'm not sure what was happening that day but man it really suck to better !  Sorry but the craving and the hunger went away after my kid found a hair in her food . The micheladas were plain ...no taste.  I could do better at home . And the we try to let the girl know that we werent happy about the service and the food ...  She had no answer or anything to say about what was going .  We pay a big bill of 7 people ...because we are resposible people. But to be honest we felt like walking out !!!"}
{"text":"Wow was this place a disappointment! Came in expecting a good lunch and it was not very good at all. I asked for a blended margarita and I was brought out some terrible tasting mango drink on ice. And what really pissed me off is the waitress didn't speak English and had no clue. Tried to tell her this wasn't what I asked for and she had no clue.  I ordered the fried fish plate and husband had the langostas. Now I would expect for a $35 plate the langostas be fresh but these tasted old and not worth what we paid. I ordered fried fish and the fish had no favor and the batter just fell off. And to start off they bring u some terrible salsa and cerviche.  Cerviche was alright lacked flavor.   Our servers also had and attitude when i told her the margarita was terrible . And didn't remove it from the check. Can't believe this cost us $70!!"}
{"text":"OMG !!! This joint in the wall it's absolutely good!! I was craving for some authentic Mexican Seafood and this place HIT the spot, after a good night in town in Vegas here's where you could refill and recharge your energy!! The Michelada drink was excellent we had a tostada shrimp plate as appetizer it was Delicious then we tried the campechano cocktail that's a serious cocktail but then we asked the waiter for the camarones Nayarit style and they were BOMBlicious!!! You should definitely try them (some type of garlic N guajillo sauce) just amazing!!'"}
{"text":"No me gusto nada se tardaron 55 para servirnos la comida eramos los unicos clientes estaba solo el lugar  los langostinos de mi esposo no eran como en la foto estaban secos  no regreso."}
{"text":"Now im not one to write reviews, however i felt it was necessary.  I'm from L.A. and I accidentally came here thinking I was going to  Mariscos Playa Escondido.  This place sucked.  Don't make the same mistake I made. Service sucked and the place was empty.  We had already finished with our food and we were still waiting on our shrimp empanadas.  The food just wasn't really good.  I hate to go into detail, cause than my review would take forever. Look for another mariscos spot."}
{"text":"Best Mexican seafood In Las Vegas hands down !!! This place is awesome in every single way shape and form !!! OMG seriously I been looking  for a place like this here in Las Vegas every time we come ... The Chef is super nice and attentive , he gave us a couple of samples of food we were unsure to order , but after we had it for sure we will order next time around , service in general is a plus , don't get fooled by the location , this spot is the place to go , \" El Balazo\" a seafood shooter kind of like a cocktail in a shot glass , must have ... Come and feel confident that no matter what you order it will be amazing ."}
{"text":"Sorry...but never again No excuses about the chef is out buying grocerys...you need to be in point all the time...especially when you are paying high price on seafood"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Great service and great food! Michelada of Pacifico was delicious! I had the campechana and it had so much seafood in it.. It was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ceviche!! I'm glad we stayed the first day, the place seemed a bit lonely when we arrived, but I am glad we didn't walk away.  100% recommend the ceviche.  Micheladas,  my girl loved them as well... although we came 3 days in a row, didn't really taste any thing else since we fell in love with their ceviche..."}
