{"text":"Great great burgers for a good price.

Skip the fries and or poutine,
Good but not nearly as good as the burgers

Will I go back - yes twice alteady"}
{"text":"Very cute lil gem of a place, my burger was yummy. My guests poutine was a fair size enough to share as we got a large it was tasty. I will definitely go back when craving poutine or another burger."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burger places in town.  Their Christmas Dinner turkey poutine special is absolutely to die for.  The food is of a quality far greater than it's dreary food court setting might make you think.  The staff is super friendly and are more than willing to help when it comes to custom requests.

A must try if you're in the SW!"}
{"text":"By far the best veggie burger in the city. Would even recommend the veggie burger over the real meat burgers (after having both). Great customer service and attention to detail. Lots of awesome toppings and sauces. 
I've seriously considered never moving out of this area so I can stay close to dragons lair. Even if I do move far away I'd drive an hour to come here."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and helpful and the veggie burger I ordered was fantastic! Was a little mushy and falling apart slightly, but it more than made up for that in flavour. The location is really convenient, I'll definitely be coming back as I go to Westbrook at least once a week to grab groceries and will sometimes grab lunch."}
{"text":"They have a vegan burger which is made in-house. I though it was pretty good. It fell apart a bit when the guy was wrapping it up. Can get veggie gravy with fries as well. I will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers were ok the bun was too soggy.  I did like the taste of the bacon jam and chipotle mayo.  Had the onion rings and thought they could use some seasoning.  The burgers didnt wow me.  Lack of ambiance and being in a mall food court didnt add anything to the experience."}
{"text":"Very bad! Fries are grey and soggy, chicken burger burnt on outside raw in the middle. Burger very gross tasting. Toppings dried out. Owner wouldn't give money back for 23$ after staff serving raw and I mean raw food! Refused to call us back after we called him. No alberta health or business licence posted any were! Treated like scum I would avoid this place unless u want to get really sick."}
{"text":"Best poutine in the city!!! I love the spicy chicken poutine with franks red hot gravy!"}
{"text":"$19 dragons slayer with 4 pattis, bacons, cheese stick, onion rings etc. Plus milkshakes for a total of 25. Fast &delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the most kickass burger places I've ever been to. Despite being inside the increasingly grubby Westbrook mall it blows me away every time I eat there. They have great service, a great selection, great prices and can cater to your needs if you are vegetarian gluten free etc. If you fancy a burger joint like 5 guys or Clive burger on 17th then dragons lair is the place for you. 
Burgers,poutine fries and great service. If you're ever near the Westbrook mall area I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Burger...4 stars.  Above-average burger.  The patties are a bit slender (likely due to burger press) but taste nice and fresh, not frozen.  The choice of condiments is a nice touch...you can even have your onions and mushrooms sautéed if you wanted to for no additional cost. The spicy \"Hero\" sauce was also good.  The patties could use a little bit of seasoning but this isn't a gourmet joint.  Ask to have the buns slightly toasted on the grill for more flavor and hold, as they tend to fall apart fairly easily.

Spicy Parmesan fries...2 stars. Whatever hot sauce they used to toss the fries in just doesn't work...it gives the fries a little kick but also a soggy texture.  A dash of chili powder would work better, keeping the fries nice and crispy.  The parmesan is very light and the taste is practically nonexistent...perhaps overwhelmed by the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Best burger champion? They deserve it. 

Dragon's Lair Burger has a very unassuming front end located in a food court, but don't let that throw you off! Their burgers are amazing! I tried the winner of the AB Burger Fest which is the Jammin Dragon double party burger with jalapeño-pimento cheddar cheese, caramelized onion bacon jam, and ancho chipotle mayo. Wow is it fresh and flavourful. Their fries are also very crispy. 

This place has a cool take on burgers for those who are celiac or gluten intolerant and offer all of their burgers in a \"protein box\" without a bun. Awesome for those of us who need to keep gluten out of their diet. 

If you love burgers, come check this place out. 

P.s. The owner is super nice!"}
{"text":"Talk about an unassuming burger joint.  This place is located in a pretty sad looking food court in Westbrook Mall.  I would've never stopped to eat here if not for the chalkboard that said it was the winner of Alberta Burger Fest!  Friendly staff work behind the counter.

I tried the cheeseburger and poutine and my mother had the fish burger.  The burgers are made to order and you have your choice of various toppings (including sauteed onions and mushrooms!) and sauces.  The burger was great as was the poutine, which had lots of cheese curds and the fries were freshly made.  My mother really enjoyed her fish burger.  They also have bacon jam, which sounds very intriguing, for a small charge and I will definitely try that next time."}
{"text":"The burger here is solid. The place is super clean, service was great and you can't beat the price. I had the 1/4lb cheeseburger meal with a poutine. They have plenty of options in terms of toppings and sauces including sauteed onions and mushrooms (!!!) and bacon jam (at a premium)! I was absolutely stuffed for only $12. There are also vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options, which is definitely a plus. The place definitely stands out in this super drab food court. Would definitely come back to try more of their stuff!"}
{"text":"Alberta Burger Fest Champion? Challenge accepted.The burger was so good. Fresh beef, and I'm way too drunk to remember what was on it. 

Decent price, great staff. If you don't get bacon, damn you :P"}
{"text":"Seems like good food and my boyfriend loves the burger. However we don't go there all too often because I don't eat meat and the veggie burger is sub-par. It's mushy and has little flavour. It's beet based I think. I believe they can do better! Keep up the other good work tho :)"}
{"text":"Congratulations Westbrook Mall, I now have a reason to come here! Out of all the good burger joints in this city, who would've thought there would be one in a food court?

I found out about this place during Burger Week and the Italian Stallion was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Just the right amount of spice and the burger was moist. I also liked the hickory sticks which gave a little crunch. Really surprised that they didn't win this year.

Came back to try a 1/2 lb double cheeseburger for $10 or $12 (can't remember) with fries and thought the patties were slightly dry. Probably because the customized burger had less toppings than the Italian Stallion or they slightly over-cooked the patties. I still enjoyed it 'cause you can tell the patties weren't frozen. Fries were crispy but nothing to write about but I enjoyed them.

Both burgers I had reminded me of one that I had from Holy Grill 'cause the patties weren't fatty, oily, or messy but unlike Holy Grill and many other burger joints, many of the special add-on's like caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms don't cost extra. Definitely a good value especially when you get 2 patties for under $15."}
{"text":"Poutine, regular, at $4.95 was worth it.
Got the 1/4 lbs cheeseburger (with swiss), with fries and drink.
Upgrade to poutine, $2.

$12 plus change.

Ok, overall.

Located inside Westbrook Mall.
Entrance 6 (foodcourt)"}
{"text":"Put Westbrook Mall on your list of places to find a good burger. Dragon's lair gas great food."}
{"text":"holy shit! so good! my mom got the Jammin' Dragon, or Jammin' Burger or whatever it's called that won the Burger Week prize, and it was awesome. Huge. 
I got the fish burger, and it was perfect - light, crispy, not at all greasy. 
And we shared the onion rings which were pretty good too!
really good service, good prices, and delicious quality! 
will return. often."}
