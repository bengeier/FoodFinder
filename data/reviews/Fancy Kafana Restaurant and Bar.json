{"text":"Horrible, absolutely god-awful service. Will never go back here again.   This place will charge for things you never had on your order. When you ask the waiter to dispute it, he will not budge, and try to convince you he brought it out and you ordered it.   THR waiter brought out complimentary bread because the food was taking too long and then billed us for it!!  Food portions were horribly small, and not too appetizing. Honestly, I feel ripped off at this place and I will never go back. What a disaster and a pathetic experience.  EDIT: how dare you blame a customer for your horrid service.. absolutely awful! Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem.   I usually never eat at a place without reviews. But was in the area and needed something new.   I told the waitress I wanted something without carbs and got the most delicious lunch I've ever had.   I can't wait to go back. Highly recommended!   Great prices too and gorgeous interior."}
{"text":"Went last night for a birthday party, group about 20 people large. The party start at 6 and I got there around 6:30; we got menus for the first time at 6:45. We all placed our orders by 7 and we didn't get the food until past 8.   I understand we were a larger group, fine. But when I ordered off the menu I did not receive exactly what I had asked for. I requested the burger and what they brought out was a burger patty with shredded cabbage on the side and some small roasted potatoes. That's it. Not what was really described on the menu. The beef patty was good, that's about it.   In waiting forever for the food, our server brought our table some bread to munch on which he said \"here, I brought you some I feel bad\". We obviously ate it all as we were hungry, so I was happy for that.   The real loss of stars comes from the end of the night when it came time to pay. First of all, the host brought a cake for the party to eat as it was her boyfriend's birthday. We ALL got charged a $2 fee for the cake! I've done the same thing at other restaurants and have never been charged for bringing my own cake. The host was never made aware that a fee would be charged for outside food.   Not suffice with that, one of my friends got charged an extra $4 for the bread! The same bread the server had brought the table FOR FREE to eat! No one had asked for bread, he just brought it. So not sure why he charged it, and why only to one person! He wouldn't remove the charges for the bread or cake either.   All in all was not impressed with the food portions but especially with the service. The party ended on a sour note and I feel badly for the host. Wouldn't recommend until they start being UPFRONT about hidden fees!"}
