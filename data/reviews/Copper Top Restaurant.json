{"text":"Been here a few times... couple brunches & a couple dinners...nice place to relax & enjoy... prices aren't bad, the staff are nice & friendly..."}
{"text":"God, it's so shockingly ugly inside here.  We both agreed it looked like a funeral parlor.    The eggs were ok."}
{"text":"The decor is retro so you get the diner feel once you walk in the door.  We've been here several times for breakfast.  Every time, we are promptly greeted, seated, and a server asks for our drink order shortly after we're settled in.   The food is pretty good and you get a generous portion. Today, both my husband and I got omelettes which come with hash browns and a choice of toast and jelly or 2 pancakes.  Of course, we opted for the pancakes.  I got the Albanian omelette (spinach, sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, and cucumber yogurt sauce on the side) and my husband got the Mexican omelette.  The hash browns were definitely made with freshly grated potatoes and were nice and crispy on the outside.  They weren't seasoned like another reviewer said, but I prefer to add seasoning to my taste.  Overall, a yummy breakfast (and leftovers for tomorrow!) for a reasonable price with friendly service."}
{"text":"If you are 60+ and have $5, this is the place for you. The food is greasy, the decor is stuck in the 70's, the waitress was a bitch. Just horrible all around."}
{"text":"I stop here frequently for lunches during the work week.  There is a daily special which is reasonably priced and always provides more than enough food.  Nothing special - classic diner cuisine, sandwiches, side salads, and soups.  I am a fan though, because the place has a cozy and welcoming feel.  Almost feels like you've gone back in time a bit.    Service can be a tad slow, but most of the patrons aren't in a hurry.  I recommend the Reuben! Chicken noodle soup is also a winner."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for delivery via Straight to Your Door. I've had food delivered by S2YD many, many times in the past, and it's been great. It's gotten here still warm/hot and delicious. The food I received from Copper Top was piping hot! In fact, the corned beef hash warped the Styrofoam container from being so warm still.  My problem with the food was the *extreme* lack of seasoning. I ordered Rib Eye w/2 over medium eggs - hash browns with onions & gravy and a side of corned beef hash. Nothing had been salted whatsoever. No salt, no pepper... not even on the steak! It was borderline sacrilegious.  The gravy on the hash browns definitely needed salt & pepper... I mean really... why do restaurants cook their food without salt & pepper??? I don't care if they serve old people that can't have salt... then you put it on the menu \"We use salt & pepper - please ask your server to have these omitted if you have health concerns\".  Finally - my last gripe... the hash browns... you can tell they either buy IQF or grate their own... but if they grate their own, they do not par-boil them and then drain them... they were very mushy. Many places do hash browns better. Again, they really needed salt & pepper. I can forgive mushy browns if they're at least seasoned properly."}
{"text":"Copper Top is an awesome spot for breakfast and lunch.  I no longer live in Madison but ate at Copper Top dozens of times when I was in high school and college there and always try to go back whenever I visit Madison.    Don't expect anything fancy...I didn't rate this 5 stars because the food was the best I've ever had.  I rated this 5 stars because the service is always great, your coffee is always full, you get your food really fast, and you get a great amount of food for the price you pay."}
{"text":"My Wife and I stop in for a bite to eat. I order pancake,which was a bad choice. They was so thick and heavy plus they did'nt taste good. The waiter left 1 cup of coffee off the bill and I did not notice it. I went up to pay and went back to my table. About 5 minutes later the owner came up to me and informed me that the waiter forgot to charge me for a cup of coffee and I owe $2.30  I will never ever stop at this place again. If the owner is that greedy.I will take my business else where"}
{"text":"I have heard many people rave about this place. The restaurant is very clean and the food was  good for a diner but the service was inattentive. Upon talking this over with a friend who is a regular I believe they were short on people. If the service would have been better it would have got four stars. I'll probably visit again."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to have a Groupon for buy one breakfast get one free because the food was less than average. It is difficult to screw up breakfast, but the Cooper Top managed to do so. The hash browns tasted as if they were from the day before. The eggs were over cooked and the toast appeared as it was toasted much earlier and added to orders as needed.  The decor is hideous but the service was decent and friendly.  No need or desire to return."}
{"text":"\"Don't let all the cars in the parking lot fool you.\"  Boasts the menu.  No, seriously.  Don't.    Arriving at the Coppertop on a Saturday morning at 9AM you'd think the place was packed.  But, no.  It's because they share a parking lot with Vitense Golf next door.  and while it's hopping, it's not exactly at capacity because the breakfast is, well, just okay.  They serve the typical breakfast staples like omelets, skillets, pancakes, and crepes.  It's a solid breakfast offering.    The service is good, and you won't wait long for your breakfast to arrive or your coffee topped off.    I guess the best way to summarize the Coppertop:  It's good, but not great."}
{"text":"Pretty good, for breakfast at a greasy spoon. I was there at around 11:00 am on a Saturday. Service was nice, the skillet was surprisingly good with tasty potatoes and fresh peppers, and the coffee fair.   Copper Top was clean, pleasant, and fairly priced. My only real complaint was the music...a little loud and a little weird. Lighting was crazy bright, but you could see the place was very clean because of that, so I'll call it a wash.  All things considered, Copper Top was just fine. I'd certainly go back."}
{"text":"Service was lacking on this Friday night.   The place had a hospital cafeteria feel to it.   The food was just ok....   I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in town for basic meals without frills but very consistent and very reasonably priced. We've been there probably 25+ times for breakfast and more than a few times for dinner. The family management is very steady. I recommend most of the breakfast items, the soups, the club sandwich, the burgers, and fish fry. The pancakes are to my liking--more on the crumbly/cakey side than the spongy stuff or the dry, tough ones found all over town. I do not recommend the gyro or cheesesteak--it's easy to get better ones elsewhere in Madison. One wish I have is for the restaurant to expand their dinner hours. They used to do dinner every night of the week. I understand the business decision but it was so nice to have a quiet place for those weeknights that we didn't feel like cooking and wanted something solid, inexpensive, unhurried, and sit-down. Oh, well."}
{"text":"Hey its breakfast...needed  late belly fill on a Saturday close to noon.  Basic but made fresh.  Service was quick but water refills hard to come by.  Family run seemed like plenty of regulars. Paid at counter where owner stands guard.  No thank you...must be saved for regulars."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 0 I could give!  I wouldn't feed my neighbor's dog the food I got at Copper Top (and I HATE that yappy little thing)!!!   A)The decor is HORRIBLE, it's not even funny in an ironic kind of way. It's just sad.  B) Our waitress was non-existent! My husband took one bite of his food and began dissecting it... it sat untouched for 15 minutes and no one ever came over to ask if something was wrong or even how things were going.  I never got a refill of my drink AND she was chewing gum!!!   C) UNEATABLE.  That is all I have to describe how horrible it was.  Both of our dinners sat pretty much untouched and no one ever asked if everything was alright, when I mentioned that we were unsatisfied we got nothing.  NOTHING.  Not a manager (the very least you can do), not a discount, not an explanation, not even a SORRY!   I'm never one to tip poorly, I know it's rough work... but I was determined to not tip AT ALL.  My husband left a buck or two, but I refused.  I don't know how, in a town with so much more to offer, this place stays open!"}
{"text":"The Copper Top seems to be a fave with the bluehair crowd.  I've tried several things over the years, but the only really good entree is liver and onions.  Yum."}
{"text":"Old school diner, comfortable food, service and atmosphere.  Nothing new here, just a good standby diner.  Why are diners so hard to find in Madison?  We eat here more than anywhere else..."}
{"text":"This place has breakfast. It's the American staple breakfast with comfy booths, great service, and toast. The thing about toast in restaurants is that 99% of the time it's bread that's been shown the toaster, at Coppertop you get actual toast. That's the extra star."}
{"text":"A solid old school diner with your basic breakfast/lunch/dinner fare right off the belt line. Daily breakfast special of an omelette & coffee for $8.00. The portions are good size. The coffee is pretty decent and they offer many different International Delight flavored creamers. The staff is friendly and keep your coffee mug and water glass continually topped off. This seems to be a popular spot for seniors as you see a lot of the same faces on each visit."}
{"text":"After many restaurant incarnations,the Copper Top has maintained its place as a regular destination for everyone from wayward shoppers to the canasta playing elderly.  At one time, this restaurant could have easily been labeled a \"deal\", but time and hard economic trends have to some extent caught up to the menu.  I tried the small Greek salad with lamb, which came with a cup of soup as a special (I chose cheesy broccoli).  The soup was good, not too thick.  The salad was an ample bowl which included pita slices and a few pepperoncini for good measure.  A fresh result overall.  Unlike another review's experience, the staff was attentive and friendly.  FYI-breakfast is still the best value."}
{"text":"Very friendly environment to eat alone or with friendsa an families.  Owners and staff understand what customers want and promptly deliver. They serve breakfast, brunch and lunch menu that are delicious and not salty."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!! Two !! for the two delicious early bird breakfasts my husband and I had at 6:30 am. Ummh just writing this review AND the aroma from my husband warming up his leftovers has me wanting to rush back to the Coppertop Restaurant again today! I LOVED my Wisconsin Skillet with ham, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and cheese on top of chunky pan fried potatoes with two perfectly cooked over easy large eggs complete with rye toast. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his Irish Skillet (Today's Special) with corn beef hash and agrees it was also delicious. It was a perfect intimate breakfast for two!"}
{"text":"We love coming here. The waitresses are super kind and the owner is warm and friendly. I love their eggs Benedict and their butternut squash soup is to die for! In fact, writing this review has my stomach growling. Ha ha"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot. Coffee is good - they have flavored creamers if you are into that. Many flavors of jellies including Blackberry jam. Good portions for the price."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since I was little, so there's a certain comfort that comes with sitting in one of those booths and getting a big, greasy and good breakfast on a Sunday morning. Everything is pretty standard and good, but there's also not much that especially stands out about their food. Basic and yummy pancakes, eggs, etc. That being said, the service is definitely what makes this place so great. It's family-owned with a comfortable and laid-back feel, and the coffee & water refills are constant which is wonderful! Overall, a nice place to come if you want a simple and comfortable breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is not bad.  It's not exciting at all either, but if you want some breakfast for a decent price, it's a good enough spot to stop.  My one warning for you though is do not order the bloody mary.  It is the saddest little thing i've ever ordered.  It was just tomato juice mixed with a shot of vodka and a giant pickle spear.  It was hilariously sad.  Good french toast though."}
