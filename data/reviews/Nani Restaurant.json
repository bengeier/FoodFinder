{"text":"Thank you for bringing dim sum to Madison! We were missing having dim sum and fortunately Nani came up in our Google search. We got there right when they opened at 11 am and got our order in right away. All the food came out piping hot - a distinct advantage over food circulating on carts.   We ordered:  Nani's Shrimp Dumpling - definitely homemade since they were absolutely massive Siu Mai - were great Baby cuttlefish with curry sauce - a must if you like fresh calamari Pan-fried Turnip Cake - nice crust, yummy Shrimp Crepe - very good interpretation Baked BBQ Pork Bun - very nice Salty Pork Bone with Dried Vegetable Congee - too salty, too many bones, not for us Mango Pudding - very nice Sweet/Salty Tofu Pudding - consistency a little too gelatinous Puffy Egg Custard Tart - an absolute dim sum classic, fantastic interpretation, a definite must-do!  We will definitely be back to try their many other offerings!"}
{"text":"I went during Memorial Weekend. The service was great, especially Eric. We had dim sum for lunch. The portions were huge compare to Chicago. All the dim sum were good in taste except the chicken feet. It lack color and the taste was ok. Our group of ten ordered way too much, we didn't realized the portions were big. We had to ask Eric to cancel few of our dishes, which he obliged. We still end up with left over. In all we ordered about 25dishes and had to cancel 5 . Also had dinner the night before and it was great and end up with leftover to take back."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC, I had some pretty high standards for dim sum. I had the roasted pork crepe, the stuffed bean curd wrap, the preserved egg congee with pork, and the turnip cake.   Roasted pork crepe tasted fresh. The consistency of the crepe was a bit thicker than I'm used to, but that's a good thing. The pork was a little too lean but they do pack it in!   The bean curd wrap was one of the best I've had in terms of flavor profile.  The mushrooms are very pronounced and fragrant and really matches well with the rest of the ingredients. I feel they may have overdone the sauce on the outside...slightly too much oyster sauce?  The turnip cake was decent - not too oily and there were decent sized chunks of turnip/radish in there...but where was the sauce??  The congee was good. Perhaps larger chunks of egg. The pork, again, was a little too lean.    Pleasantly surprised by this place :)"}
{"text":"Welcome to Madison Dim Sum!!   I am glad I don't have to go all the way to Chicago to have dim sum. This restaurant it's located where the China One was but they remodeled the place and it looks very nice now, more open and still with a lot of seating. They have a boat in the middle of the restaurant with a kind of aquarium to put live fish in it I imagine because there wasn't any today. They have a regular menu (lots of exotic dishes like chicken feet, sea cucumbers, whole roasted Peking duck, whole fish and many other ones I have never seen in another Chinese restaurant), the dim sum menu and another piece of paper to fill out in case you want something from a little cart they are driving from time to time, I refer to already made dishes you can ask the person to leave at the table, I think that's a good idea in case you are starving.   From the dim sum menu we had the #2 pork and shrimp dumplings (5) very good!!! #33 pork buns (3) (spongy and tasty, they bring it in a sizzling skillet, like a fajita so they had a great sear on the outside) #7 shrimp and pork bean curds (3) nice but not wow and finally dessert! # 36 fried sesame balls (3) they were beautifully crispy with a delicious filling that tasted like \"dulce de leche\" or \"cajeta de leche\". Service was kind of slow but the staff was very nice. I would have liked that they had more items at the table to make a tastier sauce, they just have soy sauce, vinegar and chili oil, I had to ask for a sweet sauce. In general, the food gave us a good impression because they seemed authentic and well prepared. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Five stars for bring a good dim sun restaurant in Madison. We desperately needed one! I really like this place, having been three times, and will definitely be a regular.   Four stars for consistently good food.   Four stars for decent value on the prices.   Three stars for long waits and inconsistent service.   Three stars for not too friendly service. The indifferent attitude of waitstaff does, I will say, improve the authenticity of the experience, making you think you're in San Francisco or Portland.  I wish it opened at 9 on weekends!!"}
{"text":"The food is actually good but the service is very very bad.  I ordered 6 dishes, got the first one in about 30 minutes.  The next four dishes didn't arrive until about 30 minutes later and after about 1.5 hours of sitting in this place, I decided to give up on the last dish.    The servers didn't refill our drinks and when I asked for my check, she says, they just got started working on your last dish, to which I replied, \"I don't want it anymore.  I've waited too long for it.  Give me my check.\"  I thought she went to get my check but 15 minutes later, still no check.  I hope she wasn't expecting a TIP for the service."}
{"text":"***** DO NOT ORDER OUT, FOOD WILL NOT BE DONE WITHIN THE HOUR *****  PROS: One of the only places in Madison for Dim Sum, a large menu selection  CONS: Long wait-time for food, online system does not work, relatively high costs for dim sum dishes, dirty glassware, flies in the dining area, high salt content on food, not great for ordering out  My girlfriend and I visited this place for Dim Sum. The food took a while to come to us, probably because our server was inattentive.  Overall, there were not many people in the restaurant (probably for a good reason). There were flies we had to keep swatting away and the food was very salty!   So, next time, we decided to try to order out so we do not have to deal with the flies and poor service. We used their online website (https://www.beyondmenu.com/46372/madison/nani-restaurant-madison-53719.aspx). After arriving, I paid for the food and waited for more than 30 minutes for my order, which by the way was only ONE Dim Sum dish. I am sure they just started making the dish upon paying for it (what's the point of the online system???). In total, it has been an entire hour since I put the online order in. Fortunately, I was able to get my refund, but it was a waste of my entire Sunday morning. Bottom line: if you are craving for Dim Sum and don't mind the flies, salty food, bad service, waiting a long time for takeout orders, and dirty dishware, this is a great place for you."}
{"text":"This place is so darn good. We have had dim sum here a few times, so I haven't tried the entrees, but I can say that the dim sum is GREAT! I can't believe this place isn't busier! It is THE only authentic Chinese food in town. And so affordable!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! I was the first customer of the day and when I got seated other customers were coming in too. I finished my ordered and told the waiter but he just walk pass me and went to help chinese speaking customers first! They had like 4 waiters yet no one came by and they just greeted customers they knew. They're more friendly if you can speak their language! I waited 1 hour to finally get my order in and waited a total of 1 hour to get all the food I ordered even though there was barely any customers only like 4-5 tables. The food is expensive for the portion you get. Only come here if you're dying to eat decent dim sum.. Will not plan to eat here again unless I am literally dying to eat dim sum."}
{"text":"I fell in love with dim sum when I lived in NYC.  The only time I was able to find it was visiting bigger cities.  But now it's in Madison!!!  Nani is very tasty and fresh.  Don't let the outside of the restaurant deter you.  The inside is very clean.  It's nicely furnished.    Ok, the food!  DElish!  We ordered 7 apps because we wanted to try so many.  The stir fried sticky rice was great.  I loved the peanuts in the rice.  It was very sticky.  The BBQ pork bun was wonderfully doughy.  The shrimp rolls were perfect and full of shrimp.  We also got a couple different dumplings and the short rib with pepper sauce.  I could have drank the pepper sauce.  The jumbo sesame balls were a great dessert to finish off.  The red bean paste was nice and sweet.    All the apps weren't brought out together which I was pleased about.  Everything was very hot, not warm from sitting around.  The waitstaff was attentive if we need anything and regularly came around to fill up our water.  Considering everything we ordered, it was under $40 and we got leftovers.   I cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I order rad bean jelly-O. It tastes like plastic! And the price are too hight. General T'so chicken charges Â¥14 .  The restaurant gets rid of us."}
{"text":"Good for Madison. Nice portions of dumplings and easy on the wallet"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. The food is good enough to satisfy your cravings for dim sum but it's not as good as dim sum places you'd find in Chi-town. However, if you're new to dim sum, this place should be fine for you. But if you've had really good authentic dim sum, this place may leave you disappointed. I was more disappointed in the service to be honest. There is no one standing up front when you enter so you have to stand there and wait until someone notices you. I've ordered takeout a few times, but one time I sent in my order over an hour before I came to pick up, and they did not even realize my order came in. I ended up having to wait an additional 25-30 minutes for my food.   Service here is really hit or miss. You just gotta catch them on a good day, I guess. This is the only dim sum place I know of in Madison, so I can't really suggest another place. But if you really want authentic dim sum and are willing to make the drive, Chicago has tons of authentic dim sum restaurants that will literally make your mouth water."}
{"text":"My grandchildren and I threw up right after we got home from Nani.  We all had upset stomach.   It was our first time there. There were chunks of fat in ALL the dim sum we ordered.  It was kind of gross.   If you are the chef of Nani reading this,  please cook healthier food for others.  Food poisoning is not a joke.  I'm feeling very disgusted thinking about your food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and brought my parents along. In terms of dim sum there is not really any options in Madison except this place. At first glance the prices were a bit steep for a dim sum dish, however each dish comes out is a quite large in terms of serving sizes, and so it ended up not being terribly expensive. We ended up only ordering 3 or 4 dim sum dishes which is unfortunate since the whole point of dim sum is to have a variety of different dishes. Would be preferable if the prices are lower and the amount of food per dishes smaller so that people can order a greater variety of dim sum dishes. the dim sum dishes made were on par compared to those in Chinatown. The Chinese donuts with soy milk were good but you can tell they were frozen and not made freshly or from scratch by the restaurant hence why it so cheap. Even more economical is that you can simply just go buy similarly frozen Chinese donuts at JP market and toast it in the oven yourself and microwave some hot soy milk. Would be nice if they could make the soy milk and Chinese donuts from scratch making it more worth wild to visit. Would give the place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered from EatStreet. They always let me wait too long. Many times when I come to pick up after the estimated time, they completely forgot the order. Then I have to wait a long time there. Bad bad review!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been together for 38 years and have eaten a variety of Oriental foods in a number of countries, states, towns and cities. Never have we had a worse one. I ordered seafood fried rice and got a plate of white sticky rice with nearly invisible pieces of what purported to be seafood, each about the size of a newborn's ring finger fingernail. My poor husband ordered sweet and sour pork. It was literally inedible, consisting of nothing but grizzle and bone. Service was slow and the woman who was a friendly hostess worked in a booth behind ours sneezing and coughing her way through readying silverware. A horrible but memorable experience. We will certainly never forget it!"}
{"text":"Nani has been a favorite of ours for a while now, and it never disappoints! We came for a pretty late dinner (around 8:30pm) to satisfy our dim sum cravings after a good workout. Even though it was on the later side of dinner service, our food came out steaming hot and freshly cooked. We even saw the chefs cooking our food at the open kitchen in the restaurant.  Between the two of us, we ordered the siu mai and turnip cake from the dim sum menu and the pan-fried lamb w/scallions and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce from their normal menu. The siu mai were huge, both in size and flavor! They were nearly twice the size of a typical siu mai! The turnip cake was perfectly crisped on the outside and very flavorful. The lamb was thinly bettered and evenly crisped and spiced. The Chinese broccoli was a large dish, but it was so delicious we were glad to have leftovers to take home. It was definitely too much food for just a single meal, but we couldn't resist trying the many dishes they offered.  The food was authentic and scrumptious, and the service was great! Nani has become our neighborhood favorite Chinese restaurant on the west side, and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Dim Sum! It's been a few years since I've had really great Dim Sum in San Francisco's Chinatown. Nani's was pretty darn good for what I expected to find in Madison, WI. Lots of Chinese patrons when me, my brother and bf visited, which is a good sign.  Service was very helpful and courteous.  I was not a fan of the Congee as it was watered down than how I make it, but everything else on the menu was on point. Will definitely be back for more.  Also, this was recently renovated from the former Chinese Buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"My first foray into dim sum. The food was very good.  There were four us and we ordered 10 dishes. Waaaay too much food.  My favorite dishes were the fried sesame with red bean and the pork soup dumplings ( which I am positive have a more official name).  The service was slow and we were never sure who to ask when we needed something.  The ten dishes came to $60 which I thought was a good price. I would definitely come again albeit with lower service expectations."}
{"text":"I actually want to give minus five star! I'm from Hong Kong and my wife is from Beijing.  We've had our share of Chinese food.  After going there for our first time, my wife puked and I felt like puking.  She suspects the oil and the meat is not fresh.  You can tell they heat everything with the microwave.  The tea taste weird too. Also the price is more expensive than very good dim sum in Chicago! Please shut this place down because it's not safe!!"}
{"text":"Let me break it down to you.  The food: Everything was salty, the only thing that tasted ok was the chicken feet.   The service: There were about 5-6 waiters just sitting in one big table talking and they would look over to our table or walk past our table and that's it. No one asked us if we needed anything. We had to grab their attention every time we needed our water refills and utensils. Horrible management also. All the guy did was walk around and didn't stop by to check on us to see how we were doing and when we left he didn't even acknowledge us. We were excited that there's a dim sum in Madison but definitely NOT worth the hype. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Stir-fry sticky rice was pretty dry and lacked flavor. The short ribs were delicious, but the meat was so rubbery and impossible to bite through, that it ruined the whole eating experience. Ordered 5 dim sum items and I wasn't blown away by any of them. On top of all this, 5$ for each dish was just not worth it for me. Not coming back and don't recommend"}
{"text":"Fantastic dim sum and great service.  My wife and I got a few classics, but also asked for a recommendation from the waiter.  Had us try the turnip cake, which was really good and unique.  We also ordered the Chinese broccoli off the main-dish menu and it was simple, authentic and great.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good traditional Cantonese dim sum at a reasonable price. Don't go in expecting Panda Express. If you have 5 or more people, the bottle of black and gold sake was also quite good."}
{"text":"I really want this place to succeed. Especially because it's the first and only dim sum in Madison. However, having been spoiled with dim sum from Chinatowns and hailing from Asia, eh, that'll do pig.   The offerings just rich the tip of the ice burg comparatively speaking.   I did enjoy the ambiance of the interior and the friendliness of the handful of staff that waited on us on a Wednesday night.   We sampled a little bit of everything from your safe bets of dumplings and crepes, to the west lake beef soup,  to more the adventurous chili tripe and tendon. However,  nothing stands out as particularly memorable. The Sichuan items quasi resemble what they are actually suppose to be.   For example,  the chilled Mung bean noodles (Liangfen in Chinese) were cut into cubes instead of the traditional, knife sliced. It was hard to grasp between chop sticks and was sweeter,  rather than spicy.   I'd definitely recommend trying Nani at least one, especially if you've never experienced dim sum."}
{"text":"Soybean milk and youtiao are really authentic. I wish I can have them everyday for breakfast."}
{"text":"Broke my dim sum virginity here. First time was with  a group of 8 friends. We got to sit at a round table with a lazy Susan. Looked through the easy order menu and our group ordered about 2 plates of each item we wanted. A few steamed items - pork buns, pot stickers. Fried sticky rice - highly recommended. Shrimp egg rolls were delicious. We all ordered alcohol. The drinks were strong and fabulous! The dim sum was hot and fresh. Our waiter brought out a few dishes at once. Excellent customer service. Gratuity was not included. Candy as a treat upon your receipt.    I had such a great experience that I decided to bring my family along to try Nani's. We had booth seating. Tried the milk bubble tea this time, excellent! I'm so used to ordering flavored bubble tea, but the black milk tea was great! Ordered sticky fried rice, honey short ribs, steamed pork bun, and shrimp shu mai. For a small family to dine (6-7 dim sum plates), bubble tea, and two beers cost under $50. Four stars only because our waiter wasn't very attentive this time around. We didn't get drinks quickly, not enough utensils on our booth, and had to get up and ask for the check. Not a deal breaker though...I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Dim Sum. They've got me.  There were mostly highlights here. The baby cuttlefish with curry sauce is phenomenal; I could get three orders and eat them all myself (not that they're small, just that I'm a hog and they are devourable); perhaps one of these and one other item would make a solo trip complete for me. The beef brisket with rice noodle bowl was very good. Of course, it looked nothing like the photo, so please don't Instagram an upset photo that there are discrepancies between the colors or amounts of sauce. It's dim sum. The rice noodles are rolls of noodles, which some might not like if they do not enjoy chewiness. The sauce is mostly juices of meat; for those who do not indulge in beef frequently, this is a treat - a very salty treat (warning).  Moving a little lower on the totem pole were the BBQ pork crepes. I appreciated the slipperiness but they came pre-doused with soy sauce, or similar natured sauce. The BBQ pork was very salty and not evenly dispersed throughout the crepe, but still decent. Lowest ranking were the chicken feet. I was excited to expose my partner to these, but this didn't go well as they were very gummy. We left most behind untouched (gasp!). A 5th item was ordered for the two of us, however it apparently wasn't memorable enough to include.  Next time I will, without question, repeat the cuttlefish and perhaps the beef brisket with rice noodle bowl. I will add XLB dumplings, hoping they are especially soupy. The bottled beer selection was great, however the first two beer selections we made we no-go's as they were out of both. This made the drink process take some time. This would be a decent place to have a somewhat special occasion with items to share."}
{"text":"Well, I don't really know what I'm doing in a place like this (I'm definitely not a specialist), but I really liked my experience. I've been to Chinatown in Chicago, which I'm assuming is more \"authentic,\" but the Chicago place I went to scared me a little. I love that Nani has more than just pork dumplings for dim sum, unlike the other Madison establishments. The facade is a \"suburban stripmall\" look, but the inside is welcoming and friendly. The picture menu is SUCH a bonus (THANKS), and every person seemed to be our waitstaff. We had 2 people check on us for order selection (we needed more time of course), another person brought our water, another brought our Pepsi, AND yet another made sure our dining experience was going good. They all seemed knowledgeable and helped us order some basics plus something adventurous (to us). We ordered 5 items:  Baked Creamy Egg Yolk Bun - OMG, good! and so different. Most Asian inspired \"desserts\" are not what Americans consider \"sweet.\" This proved me wrong. It's not subtle like the red bean paste dough-filled types. It's a \"hit-you-in-your-sweet tooth sweet!\" It's this puffy warm dough with a gooey sugar-crystal, custard center. I've never had anything like this before, so it was a 5/5 for me! Order size is 3.  Pan Fried Veg and Pork Bun - umm it comes on a sizzling plate, so this is a bonus in my book. I'm already intrigued by these 3 buns. The smell of the cooking onions and peppers hits you while you wait for your food to be cool enough to eat. There's this greasy crispness to the outside of the bun, yet it holds it's fluffy outside. And just as you finally bite through (cause it's been KILLING me to wait for the heat to subside), you remember \"Holy Crap! there's a filling too!\" Now, my bun was yummy, but had less filling than the others. So consistency might be an issue. 4/5  Pan Fried Green Chive Cake - when they say chive, they mean CHIVE! Loved it, pan fried, dumpling-wrap portion matches the filling portion. We made a little sauce with soy sauce and chili oil (on the table) that meshed well with this dim sum. Size is 3. 5/5  Siu Mai - at first, the flavors were a little \"off\" to me. Is this shrimp? Is this pork? But after the 2nd or 3rd bite, it didn't matter. The dumpling edge just shut me up and the two proteins blended together. I'd definitely like to try some of their other steamed dumplings, so I'm giving this one 3/5 until I figure out if another one can beat this one. Size is 5.  Vegetable Crepe - this was our \"adventurous\" item b/c the crepe looks gelatinous. But in the end is was just a big chewy, noodle. I really wanted more vegetables in there, but we only got a few mushrooms. No carrots, no bok choy, no scallions, no ginger, nothing else. So while we liked the crepe, we needed veggies. This had a sauce - it was tasty. I can't compare to anything else, but I know they could do better here. 2/5. Size was 3.  Overall, this place is fun, yummy and FILLED with possibilities. I canNOT wait to come back and order everything else. I wish they had some more condiments on the table to make our own sauces, but I'll live. 4/5"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! It was Christmas day we needed to wait 2 hours for an appetizer the meals arrived before the appetizer and we Finished to eat still waiting 30 Minutes more only for dumpling shrimp , then the waiter come and ask if everything is ok and we said no because we still waiting for the appetizer and he is totally forgot about it and start blaming us that the restaurant if full and what do we want from him...bad treatment not responsible instead of apologize to us start to defend himself so we call the manager and he apologized and gave us to pay half price."}
{"text":"Before you go here, PLEASE READ.  This place has the worst service not only because they forget to bring your food out out but because the old lady who hosts and services the food has a bad mouth. 2 out of the 3 times that I went there, the old lady has said horrible things.  The first experience was when I went with my sister. As soon as we walked in the door, the old lady says, \"This is not a buffet!\" as if we came to eat off her place and not pay.  It was such a RUDE and UNWELCOMING gestured that stunned me. The second, experience, the old lady had the audacity to say that there was not enough tip and that we could not leave until we changed the tip.  We told her calmly that her service was not attentive, we did not receive refill when all our parties had no water, we were never addressed to see if we needed anything else, and they forgot our food. After addressing this, the lady yelled and said \"Don't come back. WE DONT WANT TO SERVE YOU ANYWAY.\"   If this is the type of service you request, then by all means, head right over."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good dim sum option in Wisconsin.  Instead of carts, you are given a paper menu with pictures and a pen; mark off what you want and make orders throughout the meal. I was a fan of the pork buns, the shrimp dumplings, the egg tarts, the shumai, and the zhongzi (rice wrapped in leaves). However the congee was less impressive."}
{"text":"Had a big craving for dim sum so my boyfriend and I came to check this place out on Memorial Day weekend. We got there around 11:20am and it wasn't too crowded but gradually more and more people showed up. My boyfriend had never had dim sum before so I decided to order all the standard dim sum dishes: sticky rice, pork buns, shrimp dumplings, shu mai, turnip cakes, egg custard tart (and he ordered spare ribs in pepper sauce). I was a little worried it was going to be too much food - the portions were quite generous as well - but we were hungry enough that we managed to eat most of it.   As I've grown up eating really authentic dim sum, I was a little apprehensive going into this place but was really pleasantly surprised! My favorite dishes were the sticky rice and pork buns - the sticky rice wrapped in lotus root had a good flavor and they didn't skimp on the meat filling, and the pork buns were perfectly steamed. The service was good, refilling waters often and promptly bringing food and our check out. My only nitpick would be that the price per dish is rather expensive for dim sum but I understand that they probably don't have a lot of competition in the Madison area and can charge whatever they wish. Regardless, we'll definitely be coming back to try some other dim sum classics!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is a dim sum place nearby!  I have been here a few times and keep going back for more.    Now, the biggest complaint I have personally is that the dim sum is quite large.  I'm used to dim sum in San Francisco where it's smaller more bite sized pieces.  Do I think the price is fair for what you get?  Yes (considering the quality and freshness).  However, I do wish they would make the portions smaller and cut back on the price, simply because I want to try more of a variety from their menu (there are a slew of delicious looking options).  Every time I have come here with another person, we have ordered 4-5 items and still have leftovers to take with us.  I get so stuck on the same items that I never branch out due to the large portions, which is kind of a bittersweet problem to have, I suppose.    Flavor-wise, everything I have tried so far has been beyond delicious!!  I am obsessed with the Deep Fried Crab Meat and Seaweed Roll (I seriously went back 2 days in a row just for this) and my boyfriend can gobble up at least 2 plates of the Stir Fried Sticky Rice.  The food always arrives at the table piping hot.  In fact, most of the time we have to wait to dig in so we don't burn our tongues....  Oh, the torture!  I think the restaurant is lovely inside with ample seating.  I have only ever gone during lunch time; so, I'm not sure how packed it gets during dinner hours.    Service has been fine each time I've gone.  The servers check on you enough but not so much that it's bothersome.  It's also a major plus that they usually have a coupon available in one of the penny saver magazines that come out in Madison ($5 off $25 or more).    This may be a better spot for large groups if you want to try more of a variety in one sitting without getting too full or if you can settle on choosing just one dish to enjoy.  Regardless, your tastebuds will be glad you brought them here."}
{"text":"Solid 3 Stars.  Went here for Dim Sum with a few of my home girls. A few observations: 1. Restaurant is quite large - Plenty of seating. 2. They serve Dim Sum and entrees for lunch/dinner. 3. WHERE ARE THE AGGRESSIVE LADIES WITH THE CARTS*  *No where...That's right - At this establishment you order off menu for Dim Sum. Food was good \"A-OK\".  Tough critic, I know.  Here was the spread followed by a brief description and review: 1. Shumai (shrimp dumplings): Yummy in tummy 2. Ha Gao (shrimp & pork dumplings): Mmm good 3. Cha sui bao (bbq pork buns): Another order please 4. Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings on special menu): Eh 5. Sticky rice: Sup girl, can I get yo numba? 6. Taro cakes: Eh 7. Sesame balls: on fleek  -Big Papa"}
{"text":"lowering my standards a little bit because there is only 1 actual dimsum place in madison? YES, but... I went for the first time on saturday morning with 3 other friends, and we ordered around 8-9 dishes. I think it was a good amount and variety, and we almosttt finished it. we ordered the shumai (good), congee (good), chinese donut (great), rice cake wrap things with beef (okay), sticky rice (good), pork bun.. the more bready one (good).. and some others. overall, food was good. i do think they are still working on figuring out their service and cart situation, but i'm hopeful! i shall take what i can get for now~  we ate as much as we wanted and paid ~15 bucks each, which i was happy with. i remember eating less and paying more when i went to places in both socal and norcal."}
{"text":"I've been searching in vain for the past couple years for good Chinese food in Madison (Fugu, Dumpling House, Hong Kong Cafe, blech!) Finally, this is it. The first place with a great BBQ duck, plus ACTUAL DIM SUM (not that crap they microwave at Hong Kong Cafe).  You have to come here. It's table service-based off a menu. Only problem is they bring the dishes out a bit more slowly, and I hope this improves, but the food is GREAT."}
{"text":"They do a great dimsum lunch/dinner, and people know it!  Sunday lunch fills up pretty quick, and it is very easy to get a large group in the restaurant (half of the place is the typical 4-person booths and 8-person tables, while the other half is 10-person round- and long-tables).   The location isn't super convenient, but it's worth the drive.   Very tasty pork buns, turnip cakes, and dumplings!  Drag your friends here and eat for cheap.  Don't go whining about service here. If you need something, flag someone down :)"}
{"text":"I've died and gone back to LA's Chinatown. Can't believe I've suffered through pre-frozen, MSG-laden, rubbery Americanized Chinese food in Madison...when this delightful, authentic restaurant was just 2 miles away! You'll feel like you're in a bustling dim sum restaurant in a big city (despite the ample parking and friendly service)!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. This was our first experience with dim sum and we liked it. The restaurant had a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. The only complaint I have is that the bathroom was cold and the water that came out of the faucet to wash my hands was freezing!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that Madison finally has a good Dim sum Restaurant."}
{"text":"Yay for dim sum! This place is the real deal. This is dumplings brought in increments of four pieces each to your table. Each dish is around four dollars. When we went today, the place was jampacked. Customers were predominantly from southeast Asia, I'm assuming it's because the news got out that this is the real deal sort of Asian food that you can't get just anywhere. We had no problem whatsoever plopping ourselves right in the middle of that huge feast.   I definitely recommend anything with shrimp in it. There are at least 15 different little five dollar dishes that are made with some sort of shrimp."}
{"text":"We ordered 5 dishes. 4 were great, 1 was pretty disappointing.  1.) Pork and shrimp dumplings (Good) 2.) Shrimp dumplings (Good) 3.) BBQ Glazed Pork Buns (Great) 4.) Cuttlefish (Outstanding! Buttery and chewy!) 5.) Braised Beef somethingrather (Pretty disappointing, I'd say this was 90% tubular sheaths of skin and fat and only 10% muscle. Maybe because we were doing takeout, they dumped some scrap beef parts on us?)"}
{"text":"Lets keep this short and sweet.  Best Dim Sum in the area by far, but service is lacking. They expect you to call for attention if you need anything. If you do that they will be happy to help with anything you want.  Also YES BEEF BALLS!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went at around 3:00 pm on a Saturday.  The Dim Sum and the service were top notch.  We will definitely be back.  Favorite item on the menu (believe it or not) was the Turnip Cake. Most interesting item was the Deep Fried Crab and Seaweed Roll."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat Chinese. I had the ox tongue with tripe in chili sauce. The dish was well seasoned and had a good balance in meats. the tripe and beef slices were cooked well and tasteful. It's my favorite ox tongue w tripe in Madison so far compared to VIP and Ichiban. I also ordered the spicy beef brisket in clay pot, which was well season and hearty. My wife ordered the pork and shrimp crepes, bbq pork buns, and Xiao long buns. she enjoyed them all especially the crepes. service was also great. If we needed something; we asked and it was taken cared of. I can't wait to go back and order more of their wide selections; I especially would like to try the peking duck!"}
{"text":"I had heard about a Dim Sum restaurant popping up in Madison and I finally had the chance to visit. This place is pretty big on the inside so feel free to bring friends for a big party.  They have a dedicated Dim Sum menu and with pictures in case you're unsure of what you're ordering. I prefer the traditional method of carts being pushed around which is much quicker and gets you munching on things faster. My main complaint was the time it took to bring the food out. With everything being custom ordered, this is the drawback to this system.  The food was very good and I had no complaints. This is probably the best Dim Sum in Madison. The selection is very plentiful which is refreshing because some Dim Sum places are limited in what they offer. Not Nani!  Overall, I will definitely put this on my list of recommended Asian restaurants in Madison. If you're craving Dim Sum, head over to Nani!"}
{"text":"Thanks yelpsters for steering me & the fam to Nani.  Great dim sum with too many delectable choices to choose from.  Everything was fresh and made to order. Very courteous service that  will help narrow your choices if you find the menu a little overwhelming.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Update 10/8/16 - spoke to Justin, the owner and learned that chef Wang cooks each pot of soup for their hot pot individually and that he is picky about who cooks his dish, which is no one but him.   Nth trip back. We love this place and recently discovered the Chef Wang's Special Menu. More szechuan dishes to choose from. Try the pea tips in broth - it is loaded with ham and other protein and the soup / broth tasted wonderful. Most recently we tried the crispy chicken and it was flavorful! Not a single regret.   2nd trip back. This time, we are here to try their dinner selections. Ordered mah Lah beef brisket Claypot, Hong shau tofu (braised tofu), roast duck and west lake beef soup.   First - it was quite at 8pm. Food was delicious and exceeded my expectations.  Starting with the old favorites, the duck continues to taste good. Skin wasn't as crispy as the first time but taste is consistent. West lake beef soup was very good. Best I've had within the last year. The beef brisket Claypot ---- my oh my. Wonderful taste. I was afraid that it will be too spicy for me but not do. It was spicy in a flavorful way. Definitely give it a try.   The braised tofu is ok. Nothing to brag about. I prefer the Cantonese style with square tofu with a smoother texture. This is not the right type of tofu to use. We called this tau kwa. Very firm. Also the vegetables used were too westernized for me, carrots and peppers. Ideally this would be made with more mushrooms, baby back Choy and maybe some small bits of carrots for colors.   Overall a good experience and will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Our group of seven tried Nani Restaurant last night. The restaurant has two large rooms with booths and round tables. The tables have lazy susans which allow you to easily share dishes. There are also multiple tanks which allow you to see the seafood you may be eating later.  The menu has two sides. One side has appetizers and entrees divided up by vegetable, pork, beef & lamb, seafood, chicken and duck. The other side has 63 dim sum type dishes priced based on size (S, M, L, Special). Although they don't roll carts past and have you choose plates as in a traditional dim sum restaurant, you can order what you like and they will bring them out as each dish is prepared.  We had a nice waitress who explained how to order, took our drinks, and answered many of our questions. Dishes were brought out by whomever was available when each platter was ready to be served. Everyone was friendly.  We started with the Deep-Fried Crab Meat & Seaweed Roll. It's a crab-stick (imitation crab) wrapped in a slice of seaweed and then deep-fat fried. The seaweed flavor is very strong. I'm not a crab-stick fan and this did not change my mind.  This was followed by Chaozhou Style Dumpling. The contents of this are mainly diced carrot and chest-nut and some sort of meat. It's quite crumbly. They are steamed and the wrapper was much larger than the contents inside. A dipping sauce would have helped this dish tremendously.  My favorite dish of the night was the Baby Cuttlefish with Curry Sauce. The cuttlefish were bite-sized and tender. The curry sauce was just a tad spicy with tons of flavor. I will order this dish every time I go back.  We also had the homemade Fish Balls. These were incredibly dense, chewy, and not particularly flavorful. They were much better once I starting dipping them in the curry sauce left over from the cuttlefish. This dish should really be served with a sauce.  The Pan-Fried Vegetable and Pork Bun was another success. The bun is sweet with just a slight crunch from the fry. There is a light coating of oil giving it a beautiful shine. The insides were savory and light. I would order this again.  We also enjoyed the Pan-Fried Green Chive Cake. These chewy/doughy dumplings were loaded with chives. Excellent flavor. I would order this again.  Our last dim-sum plate was a Baked Creamy Egg Yolk Bun. This tasted just like Bisquick Coffee Cake. It looked like a cross between a steamed bun and a muffin and had a brown sugar filling. It was fine, but not something I traditionally associate with Chinese food.  From the appetizer menu we tried the Jelly Fish with Szechuan Sauce. I love to try new things. The sauce was spicy and delicious. The jelly fish were cold. They have a texture like tendon. It's dense, chewy, rubbery, and almost crunchy. I'm glad I tried it, but I would not get it again.  Also from the appetizer menu was something called Chiu Chow Style Marinated Platter. This consisted of tofu, duck feet and tripe w/some beef or pork pieces which were marinated and served cold. The meat pieces were OK. I'm glad I had a chance to try duck feet, but they are just chewy skin covering bone. No flavor; not an appealing texture; I would not order this again.  Our of nine dishes I tried, I would only recommend three. However, there were dozens of other dishes to try and I was not necessarily ordering dishes I expected to like, rather trying new things. I will definitely go back and try more."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and finally - someone decided to invest in a Dim Sum place in Madison. Smart move on them, because they don't have competition due to the fact they're the only one.   The decor was very modern and everything was really nice. I've been to other dim sum places before like in Chicago, but they did justice with the dim sum. Wide array of choices even and very spacious. Overall, great experience, and when I'm back in Madison, this place would be a great place to go with some friends for dim sum. Quick tip - ALWAYS bring cash for dim sum."}
{"text":"I am updating my review and lowering my stars for this place. First of all, we ordered an appetizer that never came. We asked our server three times for it.. eventually when we finished all our meal, a lady brings it out. We had already asked our server to cancel the order and bring us our check. The lady didn't speak English so it was hard to rely to her that we had asked to cancel the order. Eventually, we told her to keep it but she misunderstood and took it away.   I have visited this place several times. Usually, it's a good experience. The food wasn't good a usual as well. They have changed the menu a little bit. Hope fully, my next visit would be better for me to update my review."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Nani. I was more letdown by the ordering service. I don't know if it was a Yelp issue or a restaurant issue. I placed my pickup order on Yelp and received the confirmation when the restaurant received my order. An hour went by and I was vigilantly checking my phone. I called the restaurant and asked about my order and they said it was ready for pickup, though the Yelp order was still behind. I don't know how long it had been sitting there.  Overall the food was fine, though all three dishes tasted fairly similar. I'm limited to the vegetable options so I basically just had vegetables wrapped up three different ways. Pan fried vegetable roll: this was my least favorite. The outside was a strong taste of overcooked eggs.  Vegetable Dumplings: these were very tasty. Filling was great and the dumplings were light and fluffy Vegetable crepe: this was my favorite. I've had vegetable crepes before but this one was much more flavorful.  Puffy egg custard tart: not my jam. The custard was very eggy and I just didn't care much for the flavor. From what I understand about this dish, it was pretty spot on for flavor and this was more of a personal preference.  Honeycomb cake: this was delicious and I want an entire cake. So light and fluffy, such a unique flavor, and not teeth-shattering sweet."}
{"text":"Decent food. Service slow and workflow needs to be worked out. Not quite Chicago status. No hoisin sauce or sriracha on the table. You can ask for sriracha but I don't think they have hoisin, or at least they don't know what I was asking for.  The best dishes were probably the roasted pork crepe and the sweet tofu."}
{"text":"Alas dim sum on the west side! We walked in hopes of having lunch at the new buffet place (used to be the You Like buffet), but quickly realized as we got to the door that it was a dine-in restaurant. We decided try it out. Imagine the surprise and anticipation when we saw the dim sum menu in the waitress's hands. This would be my husband's 2nd time eating dim sum and we didn't have to go to Chicago!   I thought the prices were a bit expensive. The dishes come in small, medium, large, and specials and range in price from small at $4.50 to special dishes at $6.95. Sticky rice fried rice was considered a special dish and we decided to pass on that. The shrimp dumplings, shumai and honey spare ribs was spot-on for taste and quality. My splurge for lunch was a plate of three sesame balls (considered a large dish) at $5.95. In hindsight, I wouldn't have gotten them when they're less than $1 at Asian Midway or Asian Sweet Bakery. The filling, however, was a tasty yellow(?) bean and less sweet than red bean paste. Total cost for our lunch was under $30. A nice treat once in a while..or until I learn how to make steamed dumplings.  There are lots on the menu to choose from and even told that if you know what you're looking for, you can order off menu. Whole ducks, bbq pork and crispy pork can be seen hanging in a case on the side. I didn't ask if we could order by the pound like at the Garden Asian Market/gas station, but nice to know there's a close-by option.   Dim sum and other entrees are served daily and on weekends, the rollings carts come out. We'll definitely go back and talk this place up with friends and family. Spread the word!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Dim Sum brunch with a fantastic menu full of options!  We had the shrimp dumpling, siu mai, taro roll, pot stickers, turnip cake, BBQ pork bun, and egg custard tart.  The shrimp in the dumplings and siu mai were bountiful, everything was well seasoned and well balanced, and the staff were so considerate and kept refilling our pot of oolong tea. If you are looking for a place to meet friends or family and enjoy some amazing, and not your everyday, fare then Nani's is the place to go!  It was our first time, and I know we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Solid Dim Sum option. I think you really need a group of at least 4 to take full advantage of what this place has to offer. We went as a group of 4, stuffed ourselves to the brim, and ended up paying about $12 each. We left sleepily and happily as one should after a positive dim sum experience.   Some of our favorite dishes: - Chicken feet - Deep fried taro puff - Fish congee - Pan fried green chive cake  Dishes we were not a fan of: - Steamed beef crepe"}
{"text":"NO need to drive to Chicago for Din Sum. This place is as good as u going  get in mad Town.  It's kinda expensive. My only recommendation is to gather a group of 4 or more ppl so u can try more stuff. Also, it ll be little cheaper. We had 3 ppl eight dim sums $52 for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is good for the price, and the most comprehensive dim sum restaurant in the area. I went recently with a group of 5, we ordered about 7 things off the dim sum menu and one normal sized dish which was more than enough, and it came out to about $15 total per person.   My favorites so far are the spare ribs with black bean sauce, short ribs with honey, and deep fried pork dumplings. The deep fried pork dumplings have a mochi-like slightly sweet wrapping which I loved combined with the crispy outer layer and savory pork filling. The bbq pork buns, a classic, are also great. The bread for all the buns we ordered were soft and yummy. I was not impressed with the shrimp crepe though - it's a must order for me every time I eat dim sum, and here they made the wrapping too thick, with only 2 shrimps per crepe.   Other things to note - they have a pretty good selection of both non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks, including bubble tea and traditional teas like tie guan yin (iron buddha oolong). They also have all you can eat hot pot for $25 on Sundays I believe."}
{"text":"Nani's specialty is dim sum, which is the Chinese version of tapas. They have a dim sum menu and a entree menu, both offer plenty of options, which is great for those seeking variety.  I was reluctant to order their dim sum as I've never been here before and had no idea what to expect so I decided to play it safe by ordering from their entree menu. I only ordered one dim sum plate, the BBQ pork buns, which are a very common Chinese food. They were delicious! They were the right amount of sweet and savory. For entrees, I ordered the young chow fried rice, BBQ pork spare ribs, and sweet & sour chicken. All three plates were amazing. The food was not overly greasy, like most Chinese food tends to be, and at the same it was full of flavor. The entree portions are pretty big, enough to share between two or three people.  After such a delicious meal, I think this is one of the few places in Madison that offer an authentic Chinese food experience. I will surely be back to try their dim sum pretty soon."}
{"text":"Have been there many times. We really love the Peking duck here. But they no longer serve half portion. An entire duck is too expensive as a dish. We'd like to try more things each time. Wish they will serve half Peking duck someday!!!"}
{"text":"Been there once for dim sum this past weekend.  So far so good.  I ordered 7 dim sum dishes just to try a few different items.  1) Shrimp dumplings - shrimp filling was fantastic.  Dumpling skin a little thick but passable. 2) Siu Mai (shrimp/pork dumpling) - when it was piping hot out of the kitchen it was pretty tasty, but overall it was good, not great 3) Pan Fried Turnip cake - Pretty authentic.  Made well, and good sear from the pan.  My favorite of the afternoon. 4) Shrimp Crepe - shrimps were a bit small, the crepe was a bit thick.  Sauce was okay 5) Beef Crepe - beef was good, but same crepe thickness issue 6) Beef Balls - there were four of these.  These were humungous.  A little denser than I'm used to, but the taste was good.  It was more of the beef balls you eat at hot pot than the ones you would find at a traditional dim sum place. 7) Shrimp/chive dumpling - really good filling, good chive taste.  The dumplings were huge!  It was well made.  When I go again, I would pass on the crepes and try something else.  There were many other dishes that I did not get a chance to try.  Overall for Madison, this was fantastic, so I will go again for sure.  The price is a bit higher than Chinatown in like Chicago or New York, but for Madison you can't really complain too much about that.  Service was a bit slow even with just 10 tables, but I didn't have to wait too long for the food once I got the order in.  So I would highly recommend this over driving 2.5 hours to Chicago for dim sum (which I've done!)."}
{"text":"Yes! Dim sum in Madison. As there really isn't an option anywhere close, I'd start with four stars.  Nice big location. No standards carts. You pick out on a picture menu. This has its pluses and minuses. Careful though the pictures can be a little misleading as they are stock photos. Food was overall good. You can get better but not within 100 miles. Service was good though we were one of the first in on a Sunday so not sure what it's like when it gets busy.  Already planning a second visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall.  I'm probably the only one to complain, but dim sum is supposed to be small dishes, or bites of different foods.  The dishes here are HUGE, and we were bummed that four was more than enough for two people.  We wanted to sample items, but portions were too big to try many items, and that's the fun of dim sum, trying dishes.  Otherwise the food we did get was good."}
{"text":"Great dim sum by Madison standards!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The worst moo Shu pork. Never again and will tell people to never go there. Awful service"}
{"text":"Really good all around.  Went with one other person and we decided to go with Dim Sum rather than anything off the kitchen menu. I saw our waiter come by a few times, but he was very observant and waited until he saw us put down our menus before asking if we were ready, which made it feel much more relaxed and on our terms. He was quite friendly too.  Atmosphere was pretty quiet, all things considered. It wasn't terribly busy, but everything was kept to a low murmur. The cooking area was completely open, which gave off the comforting (but rather quiet and distant) sound of cooking utensils and pans clanking against one another, food sizzling and steaming, and filled the restaurant with great smells, getting us excited and hungry for our meal to come.  We got 6 different items off the menu (5 mediums and 1 large) and the portions were great. Everything was hot and looked/tasted like it was made with love. We didn't get a huge variety though - mostly buns, potstickers, and rice - so I can't speak for all the items.  We got enough food to stuff ourselves, and it ended up being around 30 bucks total, which kind of blew me away with how cheap it was, especially considering the quantity AND quality.  I'll definitely be going back here again and again. Would be a great place to take some friends for a few hours, toss back few beers or some sake, and munch on some pork buns."}
{"text":"Tonight we decided to try Nani for the first time. We went on a Saturday night around 6 for dinner with a group of 4. We had heard good things about their dim sum and had high hopes.  Once we sat down we were greeted immediately and our server explained how to order from their menu w/ pictures. We had to ask to see a cocktail menu and did not get water immediately. Actually, we had to ask again for water and were only brought one water and had to ask AGAIN for all 4 of us to get a glass of water. We ordered 6 different dim sum entrees with the assumption that we would order more. That ended up not being the case as our food was quite underwhelming. We ordered the shrimp dumplings, pan fried veggie rolls, pepper pork ribs, fried sticky rice, bbq pork buns and the sesame balls. When we tried to order cocktails, we were informed that they did not have any tonight but that we could order from their sake and martini menu. So I ordered a martini with the exact same vodka as the cocktail I initially tried to order (??)  The dim sum plates that we enjoyed were the bbq pork buns, the shrimp dumplings and the sesame balls (our favorite).  Unfortunately we did not like the other half of our meal. The fried rice had small pieces of a dried jerky like meat and small fried shrimp. It overall was very fishy tasting and none of us really liked it. The ribs were full of gristle, fat and bones leaving very little edible meat. We agreed that the flavor was good but the meat quality was poor.  We also thought that the veggie rolls were greasy and flavorless.  Lastly, our waiter never came and checked up on us to give us water or ask if we wanted to order more plates. Then when we gave up on that we could not even get him to bring the check.   All four of us agreed that we would not be back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Happened on Nani quite by accident, and what a happy accident it was!  They share a parking lot with the Americinn.  We have enjoyed dim sum in Hong Kong, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, etc., and Nani was as delicious, fresh and tasty as the best that we have had anywhere.  We especially enjoyed the shrimp dumplings, sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves, shrimp crepes and fried crab and seaweed.  I am a fan of tripe and theirs is delicious.  Service was fantastic, food was great.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Mediocre dim sum. Don't order tea. It's a ripped off. It costs you $3.50 for a $0.10 tea bag. Two stars for food and one more star for service."}
{"text":"Great place for when you are hungry and craving some variety of Asian food. The service was good and our food came out pretty quickly. We actually ended up ordering too much food! Definitely will hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"The quality must have gone up since becoming a restaurant instead of a Buffett because I thought the food was delicious. I got three items (below) and all three were wonderful! The only reason I am giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is it seems a little spendy. The Mei Fun was a large plate but most of their Beef dishes were ($18.95).  Singapore Mei Fun ($12.95) Pork & Shrimp Dumpling ($4.95) Beef Ball ($4.50)"}
{"text":"Dim sum on a weekday for lunch? Can you dig it, Madison?  I knew that you could!  Made our first visit here for a lunch on the West side. So glad we decided to try something new.  I had not been a fan of dim sum here in Madison up until today.  The quality always seemed lacking and timing was never quite right as they always only seemed to serve on the weekends.  I gave up trying a number of years ago and have long wondered if things may have changed since. At least they certainly did with the addition of Nani.   I knew Nani opened a few months back but was reluctant to try them given our prior middling dim sum experiences here in town. In addition, they took over a space which previously housed a number of Chinese buffets, the last few of which were pretty bad and garishly decorated (lots of brass and mirrors).  Ugh.  Admittedly, I let our poor experiences from the past color our reluctance to visit Nani up until now.  My bad.   Needing something different to try, we stopped in and were very pleasantly surprised. Their revamped space is beautiful and modernish. Darker woods, sleek lines and subtle lighting really add to the ambience.  Mind you, this is not your grandparents' chop suey house.  Accented by their white linens, it is a largish, handsome, understated and elegant space.  Refined, subtle, warm and inviting but not cheesy. I believe they even have a bar and an area where diners can eat and watch the chefs work.  The space is very well laid out and, I would think, would easily accommodate our more mobility challenged dining friends using a cane, walker or wheelchair.  They have a large parking lot with ample parking, too!  We were warmly and promptly greeted and offered drinks. Bubble teas were a must. Cold and with ample tapioca beads, they were a great start to lunch.  For those unfamiliar with dim sum dining, it is essentially the Chinese version of Spanish tapas dining--smaller plates and bites of unique savory, spicy, salty and/or sweet dishes, well-suited to solo or group dining. Modestly priced, you can try a number of things without breaking the bank!  Also, I think dim sum can reflect the diversity and history of Chinese cooking in dishes which can be simple yet very sophisticated; bold yet sublime; and new, yet familiar.  Nani did not disappoint and reminds me of the dim sum I had growing up in Chinatown in Honolulu made by Chinese cooks shouting in Chinese served by Chinese ladies pushing carts stacked with bamboo steamers around ginormous round tables filled with hungry locals fighting to get their faves. Authentic?  Can't vouch. But Nani's are not the tastes of Americanized shopping mall food court Chinese food.   They must have at least 30 to 40 different dim sum available. They also have a large entrÃ©e menu. I did not see a specific lunch menu. So entrÃ©es seemed on the expensive side for lunch. Dim sum prices ranged between approximately $4-6 dollars each, with a few a little more. The dim sum menu is well done with pictures and English descriptions!   They have items which range from the classic standards (pork and shrimp dumplings and egg rolls) to that which are more challenging for the American palate (braised chicken feet). But no one should be put off. There are plenty of choices for every taste and budget.  For us, pork and shrimp dumplings, vegetable crepes, soup dumplings, pork and vegetable buns, sticky rice wrapped in taro leaves, spare ribs with black beans, and egg custard tarts were all on our lunch menu.  They were all excellent, particularly the pork and vegetable bun dough  and egg custard tart pastry which were as light and delicate as any I have ever had.  Wowza!    Important notes - - 1) they also roast their own whole duck in the restaurant.  Definitely a delicious must try; and 2) despite having other kitchen talent available, another diner shared that the owner actually cared enough about the cuisine to delay the restaurant's opening by two months until he could secure and persuade the particular chefs he wanted from San Francisco to come to Nani in Madison.    Service was excellent. Everyone was helpful and patient as we hemmed and hawed over the menu and asked questions. Our water glasses were always filled and empty plates promptly cleared.    Portions are ample. We were absolutely stuffed with plenty of leftovers. With two bubble teas and before gratuity, our total was about $44. We overdid it, so people with better judgment and control will likely spend less but be just as satiated.  I think Nani does dim sum and restaurant service right.  They are a wonderful addition to our Madison restaurant community.  That Nani is managed by a young Millenial with traditional tastes yet forward minded restaurant and thoughtful customer service skills will not surprise you.    Free your mind (and your belt buckle) and your @&& will follow.  I did and was pleasantly surprised. I hope you will be too.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food, disappointing service! Went in during lunch and stood around for over 10 minutes and no one even said hi nor acknowledge we were there. There were only 4 tables being waited and appeared to be one waiter only. I love dim sum and would like to give this place a try but service needs help. With that being said, service deserves a1 star.   Update! Second chance in trying this place.  My sister in law wanted to check out the place. I'm glad I did. Waitress was attentive and food was good."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had a chance to have a dim sum luncheon at the Nani Restaurant while passing through Madison, WI.  Both of us really like dim sum and it is not an option in Iowa.  We arrived on a Sunday just as the restaurant opened meeting several of her Chinese friends.  Typical Chinese restaurant dÃ©cor.  Nothing fancy.  Could use some updating/makeover.  They provide you with a menu showing the available dishes and you mark which you want (they do not push around dim sum carts here) and eventually they make their way to your table.  We order quite a few different dishes so we got to sample a lot of dishes.  The food was just ok.  Nothing was really memorable.  Nowhere near as good as the dim sum dishes at the Mandarin Restaurant in south Minneapolis.  If in the area, I would return."}
{"text":"It won't be the food that makes this place go out of business. It will be the service.   Let's start off with the good. The food. Probably the best in Madison by a good margin. Typical dim sum dishes but they are tasty. If you've eaten dim sum in Chicago, or Texas, or CA, you will still be happy.   Now the bad. The service. It's horrible and if this place ever closes, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the reason. The service is bad. I had to raise my hand multiple times to get attention. I almost wanted to walk into the kitchen to get my own water, and to refill it. I understand it takes for certain dishes, but I don't see an excuse for any dish to come near an hour later from sitting or when you are about to pay. At least a continuous update is acceptable if it's taking too long."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and were unexpectedly treated to a short concert by the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra. Ordered a few entrees and many dim sum dishes. Favorites were the flavorful shrimp and chive dumplings and pan fried turnip cake. The turnip cake is packed with real ingredients and not from a mix - loved the bits of Chinese sausage and daikon."}
{"text":"This place never fails me. Great service, the best shrimp rolls i have ever had. Do it!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the dim sum here. The shu mai, xiao long bao, and dumplings are to die for. Good prices, authentic and delicious! Service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Far West side. They just opened in June and as other reviewers have suggested, they have a few kinks to work out. It's not the typical dim sum where they come around with a cart. They give you a large picture menu and you check the box next to what you want. We were seated quickly but then no one came by to take our order. We had to basically ask someone walking past. She was friendly and helpful but it was a little odd.   The dishes come out of the kitchen as they are prepared. Dishes came out mostly one at a time as there was quite a wait for our first dumplings. Not a good place to go if you are super hungry!   On to what we ordered: The siu mai were the highlight. They did not skimp on the shrimp! The fried pork dumpling came highly recommended by our waitress but we found them quite oily. The pan-fried vegetable and pork buns were very tasty. The short rib with honey sauce had outstanding flavor but were mostly bone rather than meat. We also tried the baked creamy egg yolk bun per the waitress recs. This is something I never would have ordered otherwise and it was delicious! Sweet and sugary and definitely did not taste like egg yolks.   I'll be back to try a few other things. High on my list are the xiao long buns :)"}
{"text":"Being a person who grew up in Hong Kong, i have extremely high standard for dim sum. So what I had at Nani gives me about 40 percent satisfaction to my crave for dim sum, the cuisine that i had eaten every week for many years back home. And because of such disappointment on how not authentic the dim sum is, I didn't even bother to go back after a few times. But if you are not from Hong Kong, theres a good chance that you will enjoy them more than me."}
{"text":"The place is very empty. But I still waited the food for about 40 minutes..... Maybe it is the only dim sum in Madison, but the taste is still not worth to try."}
{"text":"I will probably go here a lot more times in This Year Of The Monkey 2016, but I will not order the fucking Xiao Long Bao here. There is no soup in the soup dumplings. Just so you all know, getting soup in your dumpling is the same as winning your date. Like, seriously, it is adorable already because it's a dumpling. Like, \"hey girl, you wanna get dumplings?\" is like best boyfriend award material already. But then there's delicious rich broth that pours out when you nibble it.  But When the lady wants dumplings and we go get XLB and she sees dried dumplings her heart breaks. Now, I have to deal with that heartbreak. I could, say, tell her that we got the wrong order (we didn't). I could hold her in my arms while she eats what is decidedly not XLB. She would probably be crying, but I wouldn't see it because I'm sensitive and I'd be crying, too. She could turn over the table in disgust and I could protest along with her. Rargh. I love my boo, so at the end of the day, I can't think of a way to love Nani.  Please fix this, Nani. I tell my friends about you and how you have so many good traits, but your soup dumps are the worst, so like. Whatever."}
{"text":"Food was OK but service was terrible! Check was put on the table even before we finish our food, the owner doesn't want us to pay with card and said it would take a long time if pay with card, she kept asking us to pay with cash even when I said I don't have enough cash embarrassingly! My friend had to pay for my food in the end! They better wish that there will not be a second dim sum restaurant in Madison!"}
{"text":"I am soooo excited that Madison finally has a dim sum place after the one on w Washington closed about a year ago. Their food is good, not the best dim sum I I ever had. The price is okay, service is good.  They even have Peking duck listed in the menu, maybe I should try next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved it! The dumplings were all delicious! We loved the sticky rice fried rice with Chinese sausages. Also, you must try the honey comb cake! It was so good! Will be eating here again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Authentic Hong Kong style Dim Sum is one of my favorite lunch options.  Since moving from the San Francisco Bay Area, I've been hoping to find a place as good as the ones you find on the west coast.  Well, I've found it here in Madison.  If you like \"Chinese Tapas\" this place is for you.  Lots of choices, lots of flavors, all of it as fresh as can be.  Dumplings, Bao and other treats await.  While I haven't tried it yet, they also do a traditional Peking Duck in two courses (as it should be done)."}
{"text":"We love the food here. The stir fried chicken with hot chili is amazing. My girls tried the ham and cheese buns and loved those too. If I can convince myself to try anything other than the hot chili chicken (which I have only ever seen at one other restaurant before) I'm sure it will be amazing. We were a little confused on the ordering process of marking what we wanted on the sheet but know what we are doing for next time."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The restaurant chair broke, hurt my friend, and tore a hole in his pants. Not only did the owner not apologize, she actually was angry about my friends complaining about it like it's my friend's fault. Ridiculous service, avoid if possible."}
{"text":"My boyfriend stumbled upon Nani while driving for Uber and dropping people off here frequently.  He suggested we give it a try, and we've beem there twice now.  The food was very good, we tried a number of dim sum options and an entree which was some sort of delicious meatballs.  Everything tasted great and very flavorful.  I was really excited about the mushroom and seafood chowder, which ended up not resembling chowder at all (perhaps my inexperience at play here) but still tasted pretty good after I added enough salt.  The service leaves a lot to be desired.  On our first visit we had an excellent waitress who explained how to order, and that items would come to us as they were ready, and not necessarily in any order.  It was nice to have that heads-up.  Beyond that initial encounter we waited a long time for simple things like water refills, a beer, and even for someone to see how we were enjoying our food.  On our second visit nobody even offered us beverages.  I work in the service industry, and I don't enjoy servers who pop up every few minutes, but I do like it when someone checks in once or twice during a meal.  Maybe it's just me being nitpicky, but I paid for our second meal there.  The server took my card from the table, it was located right next to me, and when he brought it back he tried to give the card and slip to my boyfriend, versus returning it to me where he got it from in the first place. It's not 1950 anymore, and I didn't enjoy that aspect of my visit.  We will continue to come in for the food, but with realistic expectations that service isn't their forte."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean and spacious dining area, fresh food regardless of time.  When I walked in to pick up my take-out order I was greeted by a very friendly wait staff. The dining area is very clean and spacious with traditional round tables and the regular rectangular tables. This place seems great for a family dim sum lunch or dinner.  As for the food, I was surprised and excited that they made me a fresh BBQ Duck at 9pm when they close at 10pm. Props to the kitchen because most places would just sell me a duck thats been sitting there for a while. I'll definitely be back for the full dim sum menu."}
{"text":"The best dim sum hands down anywhere around Madison. The service is spot on. The baked pork buns are to die for. 15 minutes from campus, well worth the drive with plenty of free parking. If you're looking for real Chinese fare, look no farther. I have dined at Nani several times and will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice dim sum in Madison! The Xiao Long Bao was very tasty and a great consistency from being steamed. The staff were very kind and helpful. I have also ordered the Three-cup Chicken, which was also delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here two times in the past month. Both times were good. I forget the dish numbers but will try to remember what I ate. The bbq pork bun was good. As well as the shrimp spring rolls. People have said that they can be greasy and I agree. The shrimp in all the dumplings had nice texture to it. You could tell it was real shrimp and not imitation meat. Also had the beef brisket with crepe noodles. I liked this dish. If you want earthy and minerally beef flavor go for this dish. The fat noodles soak up all the broth and are starchy and delicious. Get the short ribs in the spicy sauce. Those are bigger than the ones in honey sauce. Tried more dishes but this is what I remember. Glad this place opened up because I'm tired of nasty Chinese buffets and restaurants catering to what America thinks Chinese food is. I'm not Chinese and can't vouch for the authenticity of this place, but it seems like they kept everything authentic. I'm so tired of American culture force feeding us crap. I want to try the real thing! I want to eat food that Chinese people eat in China! I want to experience a different culture through the food. I don't want a knock-off fried American version of it. This is not one of those places. The ingredients are fresh and everything seems to be made to order. Expect to spend $25 per person if you want to try a lot of different dishes. I recommend coming with a group of 3-5 people so you can share dishes and experience more. If it sounds good just try it! I shall return and will try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"No it's not Hong Kong or Macao but if you are in the mood for authentic Chinese food and straight up good dim sum (not precooked on a sheet) AND if you know the difference between genuine dim sum and Americanized dim sum, this is the place for you in Madison WI!"}
{"text":"Not your typical authentic Dim sums restaurants. Dim sums sizes are much larger than normal Dim sums restaurants. The execution and flavor of Nani's dishes are lacking. Shrimp crepe is very gummy and stir fry noodles is very oily."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for dim sum..Favorite dishes are pepper short ribs, congee, pork buns."}
{"text":"I grew up in Southern California where dim sum was everywhere and a weekend tradition for my family. It's one of my favorite cuisine because you get a variety of food and dim sum is very difficult to replicate at home, plus it's incredibly delicious!   When I moved to Madison I was excited to hear Nani served dim sum. I've been here several times and the food is very good, but not consistent. There have been occasions when the translucent rice paper on the dumplings are too thick or the xiao long bao is missing soup. I think for Wisconsin standards Nani is good and will fix my dim sum needs. Come with a group of 4 or larger and share!"}
{"text":"Update: Since my last review, the saltiness has definitely improved. I received a response from the owner regarding my first review, but I never expect change despite the response from any restaurant owners. I appreciate that Nani listens to consumer's complaints and recommendations!   I also brought my parents here for the first time last month, and they can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Decent place in Madison for dim sum! I had been craving dim sum for awhile now, but have not been really actively looking. I was impressed with how big the stand-alone restaurant is and that they steam/make their dim sum fresh. We tried a lot of the different dishes including ha cao, tripe, shumai, several different crepes, buns, pork wrapped in tofu skins, xiao long bao, water chestnut cake, mango pudding. Everything was very decent. I was most impressed by the portion size. The chestnut cake was delicious! Perfectly sweetened and crunchy. Highly recommend. One thing to note is the xiao long bao is not very accurate. It is NOT a soup dumpling. More like a thick regular dumpling. That was my least favorite dish.   Because I don't know of many other dim sum places in Madison, this place is good enough to recommend for me."}
{"text":"First time in thanks to the suggestion from my brother in law.  What an adventure! Both the hubs and I enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly waitstaff! I need to get to the AMAZING food, which was like a party in my mouth. We will be back for our next food party!"}
{"text":"Prices were okay. Food was really underwhelming. The worst part was that they ended up overcharging us! I kept the credit card receipt and wrote down the tip amount. They made the tip amount higher than what I actually wrote. When that showed up on the credit card statement I was not a happy camper. I won't be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Pretty decent selection of dim sum. Salty but good. Don't get the short ribs. Didn't seem cooked all the way. Get the Xiao Long Biao (Buns). So yummy. They bring you a whole bottle of vinegar.  I first thought that the food was pricey but it's worth it because of the portion size. My friend and I ended up having two full boxes to take with us for two other meals! BBQ was ok. BBQ pork was delicious. Pork belly tasted gamey still and the roasted duck was good but I wish we got more meaty pieces.   Overall the service was attentive, but I drank a lot of water due to the amount of saltiness. Also...I thought it was weird I had to ask for rice for our BBQ platter. Were they just going to expect us to eat meat without rice??? Haha.   Good for groups and families. Good for a date."}
{"text":"Probably the best place for dim sum in Madison, something that was definitely missing before Nani opened. I've gone several times and have not been disappointed. The food always comes out very fresh, and while it can be on the greasy side, I haven't noticed the Saltiness other reviewers have mentioned.   Make sure to try the Taro Puffs, and if you are feeling adventurous, the BBQ chicken feet are also really good!   I do wish that they did cart service, but I can see how that might not be very popular out here. Otherwise, if you like dim sum, definitely give Nani a try!"}
{"text":"So happy to have some good dim sum in madison!! They have an entree menu, but they also do all-day dim sum. You'll end up spending around $20 per person, but totally worth it. My spouse gives a big thumbs up for the pork buns. The space is huge, so I hope they can fill it and stay around! We will be regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"Overall really liked the place. Came for dinner on a Saturday and hardly nobody there which was worrying. But our food and service was fine. We pretty much came for the dim sum rather than ordering entrees. I've had dim sum in Chinatowns all over the world and this was honestly pretty good. Everything made fresh steamed and brought out as it is finished. We even tried the congee soup with century preserved egg and it was quite good. I would love to see them offer those dumplings filled with the hot soup inside that I had in San Francisco before. Would go here again for sure.."}
{"text":"Their dimsum isn't very good. We ordered the xiaolongbao. It came out frozen, so we asked them for another one. It was clear they just microwaved the ones we sent back, because it came back with one still missing, and lukewarm. I'm disappointed because I was really looking forward to a dim sum place in Madison."}
{"text":"My fiance is Chinese. We've been to Chinatown in Chicago many times and even to Guangzhou, China, and this Dim Sum at Nani is fantastic.   Slightly larger portions than traditionally, I am guessing to meet American's expectations, no complaints there for me.  They even have hot oil, bubble tea, and HOT bubble tea. Very fun and satisfying experience. Great service with a smile.  I look forward to going back for their hot pot and the rest of the very diverse, authentic Chinese items on the menu."}
{"text":"Service so bad! Keep asking for forks for many times, but they keep forget!  Ps. Especially two young girls were very rude and impatient!   ?????????????????? ?????????? ???????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????? ????? ??????????"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!  Very clean, and well appointed.  The menu was impressive and varied.  Service was excellent all three times I dined there.  Portions were HUGE and each dish I had was delicious.  The sesame balls, the chicken feet, the dumpling with shrimp and peatip were all my favorites."}
{"text":"PROS: Solid dim-sum, nice interior, 24/7 off-the-menu dim sum CONS: Very long wait times  If you ever crave dim sum in Madison, this is a nice spot to hit up. They have a pretty good selection of typical dim sum dishes. The shrimp dumplings, curried cuttlefish, and crepes were pretty good and standard. I'm not generally a dim sum person, but when I get that once-in-a-blue-moon dim sum craving, I'll return."}
{"text":"I only come to Nani because it has the biggest selection of dim sum in the area and I just can't go too long without having some dim sum. The food is pretty average and most things aren't outrageously expensive but there are plenty of reasons not to come here. The one thing you shouldn't order is their soup dumplings; there's simply no soup inside of them and I've ordered it on 3 separate occasions. The Chinese donuts we received were also cold, which means it was oily and not made to order. If you have dietary restrictions, beware of this place. The vegetarians options are limited, which is fine because they shouldn't have to cater to everyone, but the staff didn't really know which dishes are vegetarian. We've been mislead before twice and almost fed a lifetime-long vegetarian some pork. The last time I visited, there was raw pork inside some of the dumplings; I mentioned it to the waiter, who apologized, but didn't have the courtesy to take it off our bill (I probably could've asked for it to be taken off, but I didn't feel like causing a scene and had hoped they would've understood that not paying for raw food is a given)."}
{"text":"C'mon, given that there is only ONE place in Madison with a reasonably-authentic and rather large Dim-Sum menu, how can you give it less than 4 stars if you like Dim-Sum?  Yes, if they had any competition they'd get knocked down to three stars for the service (just flag a server down-- ever been to China?  They just yell across the room and snap their fingers over there), and maybe even down to two stars for pissing you off for adding in a mandatory service charge.  And yeah, they don't have carts, but so what?  Bottom line-- go with as many friends as possible, order a lot of different stuff, and enjoy it for what it is!"}
{"text":"As someone who has lived in California, I had accepted that there was not quality dim sum in Madison... until Nani. The flavors and selection are good and definitely within a reasonable standard of authenticity. We sampled all of the 'typical' items like Shu Mai, Har Gow, as well as a 'menu' time (one of the seafood based chow mein dishes). The other half of our party had been to Nani multiple times and vouched for the consistency.  Other comments: -No push carts that rolled around the restaurant for guests to order from. Dishes are chosen via a picture menu and ticket slip (indicate quantity, etc.) taken by the server. -Dim sum is served all day, everyday. (It does not convert to a more traditional HK / Cantonese - style restaurant during evening or weekday periods like you might see at other venues. Maybe hoping to be the Yank Sing of Madison?... ) -Prices are within reason but not cheap - similar to what you might expect to pay for decent, ethnic food in Madison, but more than an urban / metropolitan area that has an Chinese community. -We ate on a Sunday evening and we were the only party. The returning visitors in our party mentioned that's usually been quiet. So hoping for the word will spread and for Nani to keep making quality food...."}
{"text":"I was a bit turned off by the fact that many of their dishes were pork. Being a non-pork eater, it was a bit tricky trying to find something that was appetizing and porkless.   Service needs some serious work. They gave my table a couple of  wrong dishes that we did not order and it took awhile for the food to come out.  I settled for the deep fried shrimp spring rolls, beef brisket with crepe noodles and shrimp and ped pod dumplings. The spring rolls were good but with them being so greasy, I could not eat more than two. I guess my waistline is thankful for this.   Beef brisket was extremely fatty. I hardly got any meat. They did however fill the bowl with crepe noodles. Meh...  I probably won't be returning. This was my first time having Dim Sum and I have to believe there is much better dim sum to be had. This just is not it..."}
{"text":"Offers very good dim sum menu. Friendly and quick service, which I appreciate whenever I go to restaurant. It can be very sweet, but is not too salty. I would say it is a welcome addition to Madison. Spacious and immediate seating. It would say that this is a better option than Chinese buffet, which is hard to find anymore in Madison."}
{"text":"In a city where dim sum feels limited, I'm so glad I found this place! It is a bit pricey so I can't indulge as much as I want to, but when I'm craving dim sum, this is the place! Love that I can take my orders to go and enjoy the dim sum in the comfort of my own house. Delicious dim sum in Madison! (Side note: I'm not sure if the servers push around a cart with the little plates of food on it.)"}
{"text":"The Pecking Duck was probably the best I've had, including some in Hong Kong. It's a two course meal that could probably feed 2-4."}
{"text":"I'm giving this establishment five stars for it's egg custards. These are some of the best egg custards i've ever had, and i'm making my comparison to michelin star dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong. Better yet, it's superior to your cantonese mom egg custards. They do, however, make you wait for it: 30min. per made to order from scratch. The result is this supper buttery, thin, crisp, flakes-off-with-every-bite multi-layered crust, and the softest, sweetest, melts-on-your-tongue warm egg custard filling. The combination is glorious.   They also make sweet tofu pudding on the weekends. Otherwise, your usual savory dim sum plates are quite mediocre, but those custards were so impressive that I can overlook everything else.   Update: The food quality has deteriorated significantly since my last review. From the quality of ingredients to the taste. I brought my parents here when they visited hoping to show them a great dining experience, but unfortunately everyone left hungry. The congee was especially unpalatable. Although this is the only dim sum restaurant in town, i'd rather skip dim sum altogether than spend another dime here."}
{"text":"Being the only traditional dim sum restaurant in Madison, I was super excited to visit Nani as soon as I passed by it on my way back from West Towne Mall one day. It's conveniently located right next to the mall in case you wanna do some shopping before or after dim sum, and there's ample parking and seating inside the restaurant. It was relatively crowded when a group of 7 of us went in at ~12:30 P.M. on a Saturday afternoon, but there was definitely lots of seating.   The food was pretty good! Given the relatively harsh reviews I've seen, I didn't have high expectations coming in. I think this place definitely deserves at least 4 stars, though! The xiao long bao was not super authentic but still fairly tasty! It's 10 of them for $7.95, which is pretty cheap as far as xiao long baos generally come. The other traditional dishes I got were all pretty good too! I'd highly recommend this place if you've been meaning to try dim sum in Madison.  I will say that service was slightly slow though, but it was pretty crowded when we went. Overall, still a great experience though!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dim sum lunch and to check out this place. I have had Nani on my list for awhile, so I was excited to give it a try. There were two of us and neither of us had been there before. We were seated away from other patrons, so I was unable to see portion size before ordering. The waiter instructed us to get 2 or 3 items each to sample as a table. This was way too much food for 2 people. We were hungry and still brought about 60% of our food home with us. I like leftovers, but some of the dim sum was definitely better to eat fresh (vs later on). The beef crepe was slimy and a weird texture. A lot of crepe and very little filling. The shrimp dumpling with green chive was really good. Lots of flavor from both the shrimp and the chives. The sticky rice in the lotus leaf was very dense and super filling. It was great flavor though! The BBQ pork buns were a little dry for my tastes. My companion gobbled them up though. The pan fried taro cakes were pretty good flavor. They did stagger the items to the table, but by the time that all five were there, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of food that we had ordered. There definitely was no room left over for dessert."}
{"text":"Hi Justin, Thanks for your reply, it is good to know that you read the comments and are willing to improve. Since you asked, let me explain why I gave you only 3 stars. We ordered shrimp dumpling. The wrapper was not chewy enough and it breaks into pieces instantly upon touching,  leaving us eating shrimps instead of shrimp dumplings. For chicken feet, it was soft enough, but the flavor was not strong enough, leaving some of its original smell behind. For bbq pork crepe, the proportion of the pork and the crepe was not ideal (crepe being too thick in my opinion), and the taste of soy sauce was not strong enough, perhaps not the kind that I'm used to; but otherwise good, I might try a different kind of crepe later. Also, I would appreciate it if the sauce comes separately, for I hate for the crepe to soak in the sauce longer than it should. We also ordered salty tofu pudding, apparently you only randomly scoop one spoon of some kind of spicy sauce on top of it. I understand there are many ways to make salty tofu pudding, even though what I'm used to usually have more complicated seasoning. But putting that aside, the tofu was totally covered in red chili oil from the sauce, making it impossible for me to eat. Or perhaps rename the dish \"tofu in red chili oil\" so people have the correct expectation. Braised pork belly tasted good, but the presentation was really bad; sauce was all over the shallow plate. The stuffed bean curd skin was my favorite, very tasty."}
{"text":"Very large & beautiful inside.  I ordered take out, which took about 20 minutes, so the food was freshly made.  Tip:  Confirm if shrimp is in what you order. Surprisingly quiet at lunch time. Food was very good-especially the egg custard tarts-like others said best I've ever had. We live in Seattle so know good Dim Sum. So why just 3 stars?  Because the Pan Fried Vegetable & Pork buns had shrimp in it which I can't eat.  I had just eaten 1 bite of this when my husband luckily noticed the shrimp, not a good surprise because shrimp makes me really sick. Luckily I had so little I was ok, but it could have been a disaster."}
{"text":"Nani Restaurant made a favorable impression during recent weekday lunch foray.  As an unabashed multi-cultural dumplingphile, I was pleased to see the early favorable reviews.  So I convinced a couple of co-workers to join me for a whirlwind trip through Nani's dim sum menu.    It's been years since I visited this location; I think it was an ill-fated Mongolian stir-fry place in that iteration.  The new owners definitely classed the place up with a thorough renovation, adding plenty of stylish lighting to give the place a more chic vibe (as best you can for an old all you can eat buffet location).    The host immediately greeted us and led us to our table.  Our server appeared before we were settled in and shared both the lunch menu (mainly Americanized Chinese dishes) and the expansive dim sum menu.  After a vigorous debate over the merits of many of the dim sum options, we decided on the pork pot stickers, shrimp and pork dumplings, BBQ pork buns and one of spare rib options,  (Alas, no one was willing to sample the chicken feet with me - I had to save that dish for another time).  One of my co-workers also ordered the sesame chicken entrÃ©e from the lunch menu.    Shortly after we placed our order, the steam baskets with our dim sum offerings started hitting our table.  The exterior of the pot stickers had an impressive brown sear and the filling brimmed with porcine goodness.  For some unknown reason, the podstickers were bereft of any dipping sauce, which is an almost unpardonable omission.  The BBQ Pork bun were the weak link of the meal, with a too sweet bun and just a thimbleful of under seasoned pork (nothing like the version of this dish than I devoured at Umami earlier this year).  The bone-in pork spareribs were the showstopper of our meal.  Packed in a flavorful broth, this dish provided a mouthful of flavor with every bite.  Also impressive were the delectable shrimp and pork dumplings, though they also could have benefited from a dipping sauce.  I felt the kitchen did an admirable job with the sesame chicken, which provided a pleasing crunch with every bite.    For a new restaurant that has had little fanfare, there was an active midweek lunch service.  Many restaurants have come and gone from this building, hopefully Nani can break the curse of this location.  There are far many dim sum offerings that I have yet to try."}
{"text":"I learned about Nani thanks to Yelp and immediately added it to my \"to try\" list. Little did I know it would only be a few days later that I'd be asked me to decide where to meet someone for lunch. I am so happy we came here! The location is tucked just a bit out of the way, so folks might miss it if they're driving through, but it's absolutely worth checking out. I'd never visited the previous iterations, but agree with other reviewers who say that the interior is well done. For me, this doesn't always matter as much if the food is good, but I found it notable in this case.  This is my first experience with Dim Sum, so I can't speak to authenticity or compare to other locations. What I can say is that I love most any Asian cuisine I've tried and thought it was amazing. It doesn't hurt that I'm a fan of dumplings of pretty much any heritage. We spent most of our time going over the vast menus. First we were handed the lunch menu, which seemed to cover the sorts of American-Chinese dishes I grew up with so we skipped it altogether. The dim sum menu was completely new to me, and my partner was enthralled by their main menu, which is HUGE. We were warned that the dishes in the main menu were meant to serve more than one person, and they were right, we had some leftovers to share with our housemates.  I realized shortly after getting through the dim sum menu that I'd have to take a look at the rest later. I already wanted to try more than I could eat... so I chose the beef brisket with rice noodle in a pot, the pan fried vegetable and pork bun, and the sweet custard roll. Everything was delicious, although I was surprised by the ratio of bun to limited filling and just a little put off by the skin and fat/cartilage in the pot. Of course, I realize that's probably more traditional than what I'm used to so I just picked through it. The flavor was very good. I shared those leftovers with one of my housemates when I got home and he ate the rest, so it's clearly a matter of preference. The custard rolls were perfect... great fluffy texture while not too sweet. Mmm.  This particular companion is more adventurous than I am when it comes to food, so many options on the menu were tantalizing to him. He ended up ordering the ox tongue with tripe in chili sauce and loved it. From the dim sum menu he chose the shrimp crepes, which received an emphatic thumbs up while chewing. He's going to have to find someone else to try the chicken feet or octopus with, but I appreciate that those items are on the menu.  Service was great. Our waitress checked in regularly and another young lady checked in with us to see if we had any questions. She was extremely helpful to us first-timers. I was surprised by how quickly our dishes started coming out; we were eating in no-time. Extra bonus points for their tea service. I had a nice big metal pot of green tea to myself. No dinky mini-teapot, and this baby stayed HOT the whole time we were there. This alone made me pretty happy, but add everything else and I simply can't wait to come back again and again to continue trying other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Blech. A) the place is huge but we were one of only two tables. I assume everyone else already knows something I just learned B) the food is terrible. I mean absolutely wretched. We ordered a mix of dim sum and entrees, and only the sweet & sour soup was edible. I know reducing food waste is all the rage these days but we left at least 75% of the food we ordered behind C) it's way too expensive for the terrible quality.  On the plus side, the parking lot is huge"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find such a great dim sum restaurant in Madison. Service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Awesome delicious Dim Sum! No more driving to Chicago for it. The BBQ duck's skin was crispy and so  flavorful. They've only been opened for a month. It was definitely worth the drive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We unexpectedly found this place while shopping and 4 of us came for lunch. We were impressed with the large menu, which also included an easy lunch menu. We enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered. The portions were huge!! I took enough home to last for 2 more days! The only complaint I have is that dishes came to the table at various times. So some of us had our food quite a bit before others. Overall, we enjoyed the experience and Nani seems like a great option to try new and familiar Chinese menu items."}
{"text":"Food is just OK. Maybe 3 to 3.5 stars. Kind of salty, which is not what dim sum is supposed to be. You'll not need soy sauce at all as they make the dishes very salty.   Service is bad. No star at all. They brought a dish we didn't order along with 2 other dishes we did order. Later they brought the 2 dishes again and realized the error. What surprised me is that they altered our ordering sheet to include the dish we didn't order. At check-out, the owner insisted that they didn't change anything on the paper, but we are pretty sure what we've ordered. That's just dishonest and disgusting. She did admit that one dish was put in incorrectly, and offered to give me that one for free the next time. Next time? Hell no more.   The same owner also owns a Chinese restaurant on State Street. Sneaky biz practice there to charge 18% tips regardless of the group size. Similar tactics here that group of 5 or more will add 18% service charge."}
{"text":"Excellent Pot Stickers!!!! Dim Sum Sunday brunch! I think it's awesome that we have a place like this in Madison WI (no need to go to china town in Chicago).  I'm not the expert of dim sum but I think the food here is very tasty :)"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese zaocha, try twice. Nothing bad, just common taste. You cannot choose other restaurants for zaocha, because this is the only one in Madison. Only one thing makes me down, they charge me twice for a dinner because of machine issue. They said it would be refunded soon, I am waiting."}
{"text":"Friendly service, but very slow. The food that arrived did not look like the food we ordered from their menu."}
{"text":"We were in town for the holidays and needed some lunch on Christmas day before some late afternoon festivities.  My nephew found that this place was open so we zipped across town.  This is the second Christmas in a row that we had Chinese for the holiday so this was not an odd choice for us.  I was pleased to see that they had some tropical drinks so I had a Mai Tai - which is a great Christmas drink.  We ordered many different dim sum plates and some General Tsao's chicken.  The dim sum experts were surprised that the dumplings were bigger and more items than at their usual spot back home - in the end they ordered too much!  The General was very tasty.  The server was friendly and helpful.   Overall a good holiday experience."}
{"text":"I think one of the nicer dim sum places around. They don't have carts but the food is fresh flavorful diliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"Entrees: Mostly not Chinese-American entrees, although there are a few standbys such as orange chicken. I enjoyed the crispy chicken w/ chiles, which is approximately half hot dried chilis and half fried chicken pieces.  For dim sum service, they provide one laminated menu for the table and another menu on which you can write your selections.  Each dim sum option is priced based on \"size\", with a price reference on the side.  Notable items: taro puffs, which are basically little potato pancakes with taro and meats, BBQ pork dumplings, sweet egg custard.  Service is not good, as it seems the servers don't have assigned areas or tasks, so requests are fufilled on a haphazard basis.  Incredibly large restaurant and the busiest part of the dining area usually has a TV turned on.  Bring a group, as the food is meant to share."}
{"text":"I've been here before when this was a Chinese Buffett two separate times. The current owner had taken this restaurant to the NEXT level.  Braised Pork Belly w/ Lotus Root is AH-MAZING!! I also suggest the pan fried veg. & pork bun, short ribs with pepper, Chinese broccoli w/ oyster sauce and the LIVE Lobster. I can't explain in words how decadent everything tasted. Go and see for yourself. The staff is extremely nice and more then willing to answer questions! They really earned the 5 star rating!!"}
{"text":"Finally! There's a dim sum place in Madison!!!! Not as much as the Chinatown in Chicago, but the dim sum is already very good! Would like to come back very often :)"}
{"text":"Awesome dumpling house find in Madison! Appropriately priced food, great portions, and tons of options! My personal favorite is the Macau Style Pork Belly and the Short Ribs! A close second would be their Siu Mai and Pot Stickers. All of this paired with either their Beef or Chicken Lo Mien tops off your meal and is sure to satisfy your visit! Be careful if your eyes are bigger than your stomachs!"}
{"text":"So for being one of the only dim sum locations in Madison, I had high expectations and had hoped for a good dining experience. However, if our dining experience is anything of the norm, then disappointment is an understatement.   We entered in the restaurant, where it didn't look overwhelming busy even on a Sunday morning (prime dim sum time) and waited for quite a while before we were given any attention and ushered to our seats. We took some time deciding what to order, and picked a total of five different dishes.   The first dish that came out was a tiny bowl of sweet tofu pudding (which is only available on the weekends). It was cold, and mushy and just barely edible tasting. It just did not taste good, so for the price of the dish, it was not worth it at all. Next came the honey short ribs, which we've gotten before so it tasted chewy yet there was also a lot of empty ribs with no meat on it.   At this point, I accidentally spilled the cup of water and it splattered everywhere in the middle of the table. We looked around at the wait staff for assistance and no one attends to us until we flagged down a hostess that was seating people on the table behind us. She takes a look at the spill, and brings two small cloth-napkins and puts in on top of the table and asked if this \"solution\" was okay. Keep in mind, the spilled water is still on the table and this patchwork solution isn't exactly an ideal dining solution. So at this point, I express my concern that the table is still wet, and if it's okay that we move to a different table since we're still waiting for half of our meal. Instead, she finally clears off the table, carelessly wipes the wet table underneath and then finally puts on a new tablecloth.   Immediately following the new tablecloth was put on, the rest of our dim sum dishes finally came: fish congee, BBQ pork buns, and Xiao long bao (which definitely taste like what it should). When we finally finished eating our very unsatisfactorily meal, we had to wait another long while before someone finally checked us out at the cashier table.   Now I understand why it's been at least a few months since I last came to Nani, and it'll probably be a long while before I go back."}
{"text":"How does this place survive?  The service is bad. They are nice people, just lack of process. Only 3 out of more that 40 tables were occupied, there were several servers. Still I had to walk over to look for help.  The dim sum was good. Avoid everything else."}
{"text":"The only reason they got 1 is the lack of 0 as an option.   So I tried to order some togo tonight and the waiter on the line told me he cannot speak Chinese and asked me to order in English. I told him the translation is junky and asked (politely) if he can find a Chinese speaker to help me out - the guy insisted he was the only one there right now. I mean come on, a dim sum place with only one English speaking guy?! (really? On a weekday evening? No other waiters or waitresses around?!) and kept telling me Nani is an American Chinese restaurant and we are supposed to speak English.   I then suggested them to upload Chinese menu or at least some pics to their online menu so to ease the ordering process, but got scoffed again by claiming this is an American Chinese restaurant and people suppose to read  the English menu.  Okay Nani, you are an authentic dim sum place with only English speaking people, I get it. Let me finish by quoting Stephen Chow, ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????menu????????????????????  ???????"}
{"text":"As someone who grew up eating Hong Kong style dim sum, it was a bit disappointing. I know I can't compare Hong Kong (or anywhere with a large Cantonese population) to Madison, but if they are specializing in dim sum, the food should be better than this. I do have to commend their Braised Beef varieties since the tendons, tripes, stomach, and turnip was flavorful and tender. I also got their fried radish cake. I think they tried to skimp out on the radishes since they used strips instead of shredding it. Most of the radishes went to the bottom. The middle was really dense which made it 90% rice flour and cornstarch, 5% dried ingredients, and 5% radish. Their har gow had a very thick skin which is not what har gow should be like. It's supposed to be thin enough to see the inside but still hold the shrimp filling. The service was fine overall, but the food was not great."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined in for a late lunch a few days ago. We previously ordered take out and I wanted to wait until we tried dine in to review. Overall I think it's just a little pricy for the dim-sum dishes and the quality of food we received was OK. Some dishes were hit or miss, others just average. It also would've been nice to have some complimentary tea. Service was good, we did not have problems others previously wrote about. Although it was around 115pm on a cold rainy day.  I love dim-sum and it's great Madison has this option now. I've frequented dim-sum places since I was a child. My favorites are are the rice crepes; shrimp and BBQ pork. The rice noodles of the ones at Nani are a little to thick for my preference. They also came out luke warm, still tasty though. I skipped the shrimp dumplings on this visit. We got them in our take out order a while back and I thought they were too big and not delicate tasting enough to pay $4.95 for 4. We also had the baked BBQ buns. Again not very warm and they weren't brown and caramelized on top how I am used to but the taste was very good and there was enough filling. These I would eat and order again. We also ordered the sticky rice, not hot enough and pretty bland. The fried pork dumplings were nice and hot but a little too doughy.   We also ordered a lunch special to share, kung Pao chicken. This was probably the best part about our meal also the best deal. It was $9 for a plate of chicken and rice, a big bowl of hot and sour soup and a taro roll. The taro roll was delicious and we could've eaten several more. The chicken had a nice spice to it and I appreciate that they used dark meat chicken. The soup was really good and a large serving, just spicy enough and hot. I think next time we come it will be for the lunch specials with less dim-sum dishes. Maybe a couple extra taro rolls and BBQ buns."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now and I am still not sure how I feel about it.  Everything is extremely oily, more so than typical Chinese restaurants. I ordered the pork and vegetable fried steamed buns, and the entire bottom was a translucent yellow from all the oil.  We get the Nani Shrimp Dumplings, which are hit or miss. The other day, they were cooked improperly so everything stuck together and the dumpling skin would come off another one.  It's the only dim sum in the area, so I do recommend trying it for the experience."}
{"text":"Pretty solid dim sum. The shrimp dumplings are pretty legit and the congee is among the best I've had stateside. The servers our courteous and they were pretty fast when I went with my husband over a weekend. They have a restaurant style system rather than the push carts you see at more traditional places but that's fine because you're plate is being prepped to order rather than waiting for the cart you want to come by. I'll definitely be bringing my friends to this place."}
{"text":"Was excited to have a dim sum place in Madison. We ordered a bunch of different dishes. 7 total which is a bit too much for two people but we're able to take them home.   We were disappointed in the Xiao Long Buns (Baos). There was no juice in them. Typically, you eat these with a spoon. You place one on a spoon and nibble some of the top off. Then you proceed to slurp out the super yummy juice. Anyways, these are more like steamed dumplings though the meat was very mushy and wouldn't hold its shape. It seemed like they used a lot of fillers, possibly flour, that made the meat act this way.   I would recommend the pot stickers instead though there were a LOT of chives.   The deep-fried dough sticks was the best dish we had. It's best to eat these hot.   Although they do mention *picture for reference only, please prevail in kind* on the menu, it was disappointing to get no veggies in the vegetable crepe. There are absolutely no greens on the dim sum menu. Instead it was filled with different types of fungi. It would have been nice to have some real veggies in it.   On to the sweets - the deep-fried sesame balls are good. The outer shell was a bit harder and crunchier than I have had before, but overall they were tasty.   The puffy egg custard tarts are good though the shell is a bit in the buttery side. The flavor is good though.   The service was good and attentive. They speak both English and Mandarin. I didn't hear any other dialects when I was there.   If you have never been to a dim sum place, they will walk you through it. Basically, just mark down how many of the dishes you want. You can always request more later. Each dish will come one at a time so expect a wait in between dishes.   For those who have had good dim sum, you may be disappointed. Things are on the greasy and salty side, as others have mentioned."}
{"text":"I went there a few weeks after they opened. The food dim sum was decent, but the service was poor. We didn't get our food until 45 mins later. They charged us $7.00 for a bottle of miller lite, I think that's extreme for domestic 12 oz beer. Seems like the waiters and waitresses were confused and were not sure what we order, we ended up not getting two of our dim sum orders. We were told the kitchen recycled our paper where we placed our order...lol. After our first time with poor service, we wanted to give them another chance. We went back a week later and this time the service was even worse. We sat at our table for a good 25 minutes, no one came and asked us if we wanted water or even gave us the menu. We decided to leave the place. Until I hear the service has improved, I will not waste my time and money at this place."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful surprise. We had a good assortment of some traditional dim sum dishes (dumplings, pork buns, etc) and everything was hot and tasty, and many (like the pork and chive dumplings) were much bigger than we were expecting. Because you had to order off a menu rather than pick from carts, this resulted in us over ordering. The only real drawback is they didn't have some stuff, like Chinese broccoli, roast duck, noodles, etc. on the dim sum menu, so we had to order full (and huge) entrees of those. Oddly, the entrees didn't automatically come with rice. Despite those drawbacks, all of the food we got was delish!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dim sum the other day and had an overall pleasant experience. We ordered a bunch of different things off the menu and we were all left satisfied. Everything came out pretty quickly and piping hot! Our waitress was a little slow at times, despite the restaurant being pretty empty. I can't remember the name of everything that we ordered but everything was decent. My favorite was probably the pork belly and lotus root, super flavorful and super delicious."}
{"text":"The staff was so nice, and the dim sum we ordered was just delicious (sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf, 3 kinds of dumplings, a beef and rice noodle dish, a pork belly and lotus root dish, taro root cake, and congee - our eyes were bigger than our stomachs so we took some home).  Very reasonably priced.  No longer need to travel to Chicago for great dim sum; it's just down the road.   Love that you can get it every day of the week.  Can't wait to go there again!!! Really hope that this place thrives in Madison."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!!  Food was outstanding and service was great as well. Our group tried 10 things and we enjoyed them all. Favorites were the Cuttlefish, Honey Short Ribs, egg yolk paste bun, and Sesame Balls. Lots more we want to try next time.  We've had Dim Sum in a lot of different places and are excited to have found this spot!"}
{"text":"Service needs improvement! Waiters did not come to us asking for what to order. We went to the waiter instead. No water provided. Good food with so-so :( service."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. I admittedly didn't have any high hope at first because the previous restaurants at this location weren't good at all. The new owner has definitely made it right. Madison was long due for a dim sum restaurant, let alone a decent one. For the background, I'm a huge fan of dim sum. My wife and I often drive to Chinatown in Chicago just for dim sum and Chinese BBQ. I'm so happy I don't have to do it anymore. The food is good. The portion is on the plus side, and the price is on the spot. Dim sum is available all day including weekdays. I also tried a lÃ  carte dishes. Japanese tofu in abalone sauce is recommended. I love the fresh soy milk, and they put sugar on the side for you. There're more on the menu that I want to come back for."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends Saturday for lunch.  We had like 18 things, so I'm not going to list them.  We all quite enjoyed the experience."}
