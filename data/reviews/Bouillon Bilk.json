{"text":"This is an exceptional restaurant and the price matches the quality of the food. The preparations are really inventive, the ingredients exceptionally fresh. It's clear that a lot of care goes into the preparation and planning of each dish. My fish was screaming fresh and my venison was remarkably tender and flavorful with a really interesting coffee chocolate sauce. The wait staff is very professional and attentive and it's clear that you are in a quality restaurant that cares about the food it's serving. The sourdough bread was really good too, though not as good as Tartine in San Francisco. But this is Montreal after all."}
{"text":"One of the best gastronomy restaurants i have been and I have been to quite a lot in all the big cities in US. Ingredients are so fresh and well balanced. I was even amazed by the tasty butter they provide with bread and I had to ask the source. We had the lobster and linguine for starter. We select cod and veal as main entrees. Veal is especially memorable. It contains three parts of cow: veal, sweetbread and tongue. Sweetbread is just out of the world. The service is perfect too. The waiter is very knowledgable on all the ingredients and their sources. Overall, great experience! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. My husband, a friend, and I dined here august 14th. The host and servers were all very cold. We are tourists and I'm not sure if that had anything to do with how we were treated."}
{"text":"One of the more creative places in Montreal. I'm always really impressed by the flavours and the presentation. Wine list was very good and the staff were quite friendly. The place felt a bit cramped and loud but otherwise I would definitely say it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Second visit to Montreal, second visit to this lovely place.  Story short- Best restaurant in Montreal.

Well educated staff- the server recommended a French 100% Cab Franc.  Who does that?  They do and it was a home run.  She was able to give detailed menu descriptions of a very involved menu in French and English.  Who does that?  They do!

Food was so delicious-  from the quality of the ingredients to the subtle and carefully execute preparation- it was all perfect!  See you next year!!"}
{"text":"When our concierge suggested this place as interesting and his favorite for special ocations he was not wrong. The mix between Asian, French and Italian is something else. The place is minimalist and the staff is very professional and very au courant of your needs and likes.
DO NOT miss this place whenever in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very nice fancy food in a weird spot on St laurent street.
First of all, we have a to agree than the food arrangements are real \"oeuvres d'art\" . every plates that i saw around me was incredibly beautiful and looked amazing.
And so was the hamachi apetizer that i had( hamachi, yuzu kosho, pamplemousse, fenouil, concombre  ) which was full of refreshing flavors. I actually never had something similar in taste before...also it was kind of a small portion so i was even more hungry than before i walked in the place lol which is a good thing because the main course was incredible. I had the rabit raviolis (ravioli, ricotta, lapin, morilles, têtes de violon, pistaches). It probably one of the best and interesting flavors ive ever had the chance to taste in my life. I think its the first time that i truly enjoyed mushrooms !! The desert was also very good but i cant remember what i had..something with chocolate and icecream i think..
In the end...truly a must in mtl (if you have the money, or a  very nice boyfriend hehe)!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this restaurant! The presentation of the food was neat, very creative and delicious. I enjoyed every bite! Cozy ambiance.The service was very attentive and they have a great choice of wines."}
{"text":"We had a great plat of oysters, beans, meats, fois gras, etc. Really nice atmosphere and service. Classy. We shall return!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food. Especially the foie gras and the sea bream, just love this meal..."}
{"text":"During a trip to Montreal, I had my birthday dinner at this restaurant. I wasn't sure what to expect because the place I had originally wanted to go was closed and this was my last minute choice. The food, however, was incredible! Our server was extremely knowledgeable and patient. Every dish was brought out by one of the chefs (or cooks or someone from the kitchen, at least) and explained. Although it was a little on the expensive side and portions were small, I can't wait to go back here."}
{"text":"Je recommande chaudement.
Tout y était: service impeccable et sympathique, apéro délicieux et original, superbes huîtres en entrée.
Pour le plat, les pétoncles étaient tout simplement somptueuses.

J'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner."}

Moi mon coup de coeur c'est les linguini au fromage bleu et bacon double fumé..."}
{"text":"This place was so cool. I mean, seriously, I felt like I didn't qualify as cool enough to be there. It's an experience and the food is top notch, with unexpected flavors that go amazing well together. It was also very expensive and we puzzled over how the hipsters who were eating there could afford it. We barely could. If you're looking for upscale that is interesting and unstuffy, this should definitely be one of your top three picks in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the bartender made great recommendations. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were on vacation and happily found this place, thanks to all the YELP reviews! Outstanding food & service! We were a party of 6 and everyone loved their dishes, from appetizers to entrees, like salomn, beef..etc...finally desserts! Don't pass on desserts, which is presented artfully. We definitely would come back here the next time we're in Montreal (BTW Old Montreal is wonderful!). Make your reservations and enjoy the phenomenal food!"}
{"text":"Très belle endroit espace blanc chic clientèle de bureau le midi. Repas gastronomique très bon service vin au verre ou bouteille commençant à 32$.  ;)"}
{"text":"My experience here was great. The interior is understated approaching sterile. The food is good and a reasonable price, but is it a revelation? I think not. There doesn't seem to be a definitive fine dining restaurant in montreal, so don't come expecting a world-class meal . With that said, you will likely have a good time here. If you are in pursuit of the best food, I honestly enjoyed my food more at Joe Beef, but it is less formal there and a different experience."}
{"text":"After a long search for the perfect restaurant in Montreal, the ratings drew us to Bouillon Bilk.  
It was just like the reviews said.

Excellent customer service. The staff instantly makes you feel as though they are your friends and you could ask them anything. They are very knowledgeable and make everything on the menu sound delicious!

The food was top notch.  A week later I still have visions of the amuse-bouche dancing in my mouth.  As a starter I had the duck, amazing. They used flavour and texture combinations that I would have never dreamed of!  Venison as my main, so tender and cooked to perfection. Followed by a delicious bread pudding sitting in caramel, chocolate and hazelnuts that was to die for.  

We loved our experience at Bouillon Bilk and will definitely be eating there on our next visit to Montreal!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Went here with a group of 5 girls and everyone loved their meal. The waiter was fantastic. For me, the biggest attraction was listening to the waiter describe the choices on the menu: everything sounded incredible!"}
{"text":"Portions are small and very Saucy service is not great however eat bite us very flavour the scallops are amazing and the bread is delicious!

The food is a work of art."}
{"text":"Bouillon Bilk is my new coup de coeur. Having dinner there is a special treat!

It's clear that a lot of thought has been put into creating a multi sensory dining experience. And I usually tend to be skeptical with fancy nouvelle cuisine, as I find mixing too many flavors often results in loosing the taste of the main ingredient.But at Bouillon Bilk that's not the case. Everything we had was perfectly balanced and delicious.

We had the hamachi, the smoked salmon with pears, the bar, the scallops, the guinea fowl, a cheese platter and desert!

I had agnoletti, lobster pasta and the carrot cake dessert. All were amazing & the service impeccable. I drool thinking of when i will next go back. A must try in montreal"}
{"text":"Very humble & creative chef and food came out beautiful and tasty. 

It will be a 5 star review if the service improves. Lack of proper training and waitresses bump on customers chair, drop forks, drop everything else on the ground so often you have to be mentally prepared. Is a weekly regular at this place, but last time I went they give me a bad positioned table. I called very early to make that reservation and they should've given a better one. I tipped them 20% every time I went because I appreciate the food. Clearly, the wait stuff deserves so much less than that."}
{"text":"This place is good. Tried their tasting menu, and well balanced flavors in their dishes."}
{"text":"Sehr schönes Restaurant mit sehr gutem Essen! 
Man würde ein solches Restaurant in dieser Gegend wohl eher nicht vermuten und wenn man nicht wüsste, dass man dort richtig ist, dann wäre ich vermutlich vorbei gelaufen. 
Das Restaurant ist sehr schlicht, aber schick eingerichtet. Die Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich und aufmerksam und gestalten den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm. 
Jeder Gang wird beim Servieren noch einmal erklärt und sieht nicht nur toll aus, sondern schmeckt auch genial. 
Die Preise sind zwar nicht ganz niedrig, aber man bekommt wirklich etwas geboten für sein Geld. 
Auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! We has the Fois Gras to start and then the Scallops for mains. Both dishes were visually appealing and absolutely delicious. 

This place is a must visit if you are in Montreal. Call ahead for reservations, it's a popular joint even though not the usual tourist spot. I will definitely go back during my next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing service and perfectly executed dinner - lamb pasta cooked perfectly to align dente and seasoned well and also had the tartar equally wonderful (and we ate tartar every day here)

Don't miss"}
{"text":"I've been twice and loved it! The food is delicious and creative, the vibe is comfortable and the staff is friendly. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Buillion Bilk has fantastic, creative dishes full of flavor. The atmosphere is bustling, as it's a popular spot, but the service is warm and unpretentious. This was one of the best meals my partner and I have ever had."}
{"text":"Torn between 5 and 4 stars, but ended on 4 since I feel there are discernibly better places in MTL to dine and wine. Always packed, this place is good for culture,and the personnel prepared to assist in food and drink selection. If in MTL, make this a priority to visit. I simply cannot give it 5 stars because other places nearby merit that accolade only slightly more."}
{"text":"I had two of the best meals of our trip to Montreal (and possibly ever) at Bouillon Bilk. What a great restaurant! And the service was positively lovely.

We stupidly decided on this place when it was too late to make a reservation. So we showed up early, around 6:30 and they sat us at the bar. The service was lovely and the food was sumptuous, creative, and just incredible.

We loved it so much we went back for lunch the next day. This stands out as one of the most memorable meals ever, and that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Thursday august 3rd was my first and last visit at Bouillon Bilk. First of all we were greated and seated by a very cold and snobby hostess. We start off with the 6$!amuse-bouche consisting of three tiny tuna cubes and a burnt nori chip. We already knew something was wrong. Appetizers were okay although I couldnt even taste the fine and delicate hamachi in mine because of how strong the yogurt like sauce tasted. My guinea fowl entree was really ordinary and super small and the fried oysters in the beef dish resembled frozen tempura fish nuggets. Desserts were okay, the rubarb one was delicious! Overall portions were super small and leave you hungry and they use appealing words like foie gras and urchin but they're only present in sauces you don't really taste them. Way too expensive for what it was and hostesses preferred talking to each other than saying goodbye to us even though I tried to!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food and even better service.   We were seated promptly and at great table. Amuse bouche excellent and did exactly that. I won't write too much about specific menu as it changes regularly.  Just know we had nothing that was not world class."}
{"text":"Everytime I come back here, I eat something new!!!

Carrots, whoever thought carrots were tasty, but it was!!! 

We had the carrot risotto, the lobster with almond sauce, ravioli, and sweet breads and octopus, yeah it's like this weird surf and turf and for dessert a banana cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce, it was weak and really not on par with the savory stuff.
 
I find this place extremely interesting and original. They come up with the most unsual combinations of ingredients and when you think about it, it's not clearly obvious why someone would put these things together, then you eat it and you're like wow really this makes sense why didn't people think of this...

Nothing is straightforward here, it's always an obtuse and oblique interpretation as usual!!! 

I'm not saying I've liked everything I ate here, but some of the stuff I didn't like, I can still see there was some thought put into it, what the chef was trying to do. That for me still gets points even if I didn't like the dish. When I eat here I can feel the intense passion for the food more so than most other places, I don't know who creates the menu at this place but I'm thinking it has to be someone so interesting!!! I know whatever, let me have my fantasy!!! lol

examples from previous visits:

foie gras and rhubarbe, 
(foie gras is torchon not seared, I think the seared foie gras would have been better)

seared shrimps with bone marrow and orange miso sauce !!! 
this one was amazing

And this time carrot risotto with passion fruit, sweetbreads and octopus.

The carrot risotto, carrot in the sauce, with carrot bits, seriously could be the best risotto I've had the past few years. Maybe there was too much sauce or too runny as they say, but I didn't mind, It tasted great. My one only caveat was the shrimps were kind of like those mini cocktail shrimps and they didn't add anything to the dish, maybe a sear could add more flavour. The dish was amazing never thought carrots could taste so good.

The sweetbread and octopus. the sweetbreads was crispy and octopus was tender, garnished with peach slices, string beans and mushrooms. a pleasant dish fresh with contrasting textures colours and flavours. very nice, I promote this place to be my new favourite french resto in MTL.

The ravioli was much better meat was better salted this time around huge improvement over last time, and the ravioli texture was perfect. The lobster was so so, didn't fly for me.

FYI: they just expanded about 3 weeks ago, it is now twice as big, they took over the space next door."}
{"text":"Best meal my partner and I had in Montreal! It was a wonderful way to end off our trip. Better than the tasting menu at Momofuku Shoto in Toronto. 

Amuse bouche - crawfish and quail egg dashi

Hamachi and beet appetizers - beautiful dishes! 

Venison and scallop mains - I loved the scallops! I literally smiled before I took each bite. My favourite of the night :)

Chocolate financier and hazelnut cake for dessert. Yum!

The restaurant was pretty busy, but the spacing between the tables was far enough that I wasn't uncomfortable and I'm the type of person who gets anxious in crowds

Service was friendly and helpful. Unobtrusive, yet right there just when you need them

Dinner for two with dessert and a few drinks including tip was about $200-$250

Will visit again the next time we're in the city"}
{"text":"Savoureux. Un resto dispendieux qui vaut la peine! Service parfait. Bons mariages de vins et mets."}
{"text":"This meal is right there with the best meals I've ever had. 

The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable. While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food.

We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue. The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber. Delicious, clean, and light. The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender. 

For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek). All three variations of the duck were amazing. The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own. The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it. 

We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil. Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal. 

The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try."}
{"text":"We were only in Montreal for a few days and wanted to make sure we ate some delicious french cuisine. This place is just it! 

Staff was exceptionally friendly and able to accomodate us last minute at the bar which was not at all crowded and still an excellent experience. 

More importantly, the food was unique, creative and delicious! The portions were more than adequate leaving us feeling full and satisfied. The food is a bit pricier but so worth it. Everything from apps to dessert was top notch. 

Would come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I am rarely impressed enough by a restaurant to want to take the time to write a review, but in this case I just had to add my voice to the rave reviews. You'll find here a unique combination of a small, friendly-yet-trendy neighborhood restaurant atmosphere on the one hand, and absolutely exquisite, innovative and refined dishes on the other. I went there to celebrate a birthday with a group of close friends, all of whom know the Montreal restaurant scene very well and have travelled extensively. We got to taste most of the dishes on the menu that evening and were blown away. I had the roasted garlic broth and the lobster dish--pure bliss."}
{"text":"Délicieux! Ça faisait longtemps que je voulais y aller mais enfin, j'en ai eu l'occasion! Tout était délicieux, les portions copieuses. Nous y avions été le midi. Le menu est quand même assez cher mais ça valait la peine! Bon choix de vin"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. It might be the very best restaurant I have ever been to. And I have been to many good restaurants. The service was impeccable and the food was brilliant.

The restaurant is rather elusive. It is hidden between two cheap electronic stores and there is no sign on the door. I had to walk twice in front of it to actually find the door. Once inside, it was actually rather entertaining to see other people do the same.

The wine selection is rather large and they offer a lot of wines by the glass. However, I asked for something non-alcoholic: an iced tea. I was sitting at the bar and the bar tender told me: \"we don't have iced tea. I can make you one if you want but it will take five minutes.\" Awesome. That Iced tea was very carefully crafted with a but of sweetness perfectly balanced by a little lemon. I loved it. And I love that he just made it on the spot.

As a starter, I ordered a special: some crab salad on a perfectly toasted bread with radish, avocado purée and charred avocado. Right after the first bite, I was absolutely amazed. It was so fresh, flavorful and balanced. Then, I had scallops with charred zucchini, shiitake, pear and watercress. So much pleasure into every bite.

Then, I asked if, by any chance, the bartender would be willing to make me another iced tea. Not only he was willing, but he had thought about it ahead of me: I thought you might want a second one so I had prepared a little more. That's what an impeccable service is.

Finally, for desert, I had a \"baba aux fraises\". It was great but could have been better. The strawberries could have been sweeter. it was still delicious though."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place even though I wanted very much to like it. Everything was WAY too salty. We had the 8 course tasting menu, with a couple of drinks the bill came to 300 dollars for 2 people. The portions were tiny but if that were the only complaint I would still give it 5 stars. But for that price I did not expect have overly salty dishes one after the other. The first course was great but it went downhill after that. On top of that it was a very busy night so not once did the waitress come to ask us how we were doing. One thing I have to give them props for was that they allowed substitutions for 2 courses I did not want. And I have to say the substitutions they gave me looked better than the original (ie. instead of rabbit I got deer and instead of pigeon I got lamb which looked a lot better than the pigeon which had a tiny shrivelled claw sticking out)"}
{"text":"Either make sure you come late enough so you won't go hungry later in the evening or make sure to plan for a second dinner. The food was plated beautifully and tasted heavenly, but portion size is not what you're paying for. I still give it 5 stars because the food was really tremendous. We order two appetizers, a dozen oysters, two main dishes, and two drinks and spent over 200$ with gratuity. 

Everything we ordered was scrumptious. Started off with a dozen oysters from Nova Scotia and British Columbia, then had appetizers of big eye tuna (special) and turbot. Our mains were halibut for the wife and scallops for myself. Since we had all seafood, it probably contributed to a not so full stomach, but every bite was delicious.

French food isn't meant to be filling right?"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with this place since reading the rave reviews. The food was good, but I can't say great. My main dish was cold when it arrived. Although the quality of the food was quite good, I felt that the portion sizes were quite small, and that is saying something from me! I had the beet salad as a starter, the pork stew with ravioli for a main and the grapefruit mousse for desert. The desert was great but the other two dishes were just good in my opinion. 

The service was very good and the ambiance was so so. I don't think I will go back soon, not trying to be harsh, but there are lots of other great places to eat in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with fantastic dishes and excellent service.  Not surprising that it's one of the best restaurants in Canada, let alone Montreal.  Strawberry salad (if it is still around) was very good, and a standout, in my opinion.  Simple, clean decor doesn't distract from the amazing dishes.  I recommend this place for a splurge."}
{"text":"I rarely take the time to commit a review to \"paper\" unless the place is truly outstanding or abysmally awful. This modern french bistro with clean delicious flavors, artful presentation, and inventive combinations is entirely worth it. The best dining experience in Montreal, and possibly my new all-time favorite restaurant.

The customer service was excellent.  The waitress sent over the sommelier to help me select a wine and recommend the perfect cocktail for my boyfriend.  The sommelier came by later to check on us and instruct us on making the cocktail at home.

We started with the foie gras and asparagus appetizers.  Both were very good, though the foie gras was a revelation.  My boyfriend ordered the scallops with hazelnut butter and I had the halibut over a salad with a buttery foam.  Again, both were delicious, but the scallops were perfection with a rich caramelized sauce that was so heavenly, I had to fight the urge to lick his plate clean. 

I have not stopped raving about this place to colleagues, friends, and family."}
{"text":"Went there to have a casual salmon burger type of thing. Ended up with the best food i have ever seen in Montreal. We shared snapper sashimi, smoked duck, octopus and pork flank.
It was served with grace and joy. All the food displayed great technique, an appreciation of flavours, and was complicated but not fussy.
This is a unique resto with a  fun chef and a very special vibe.
I wish them great success."}
{"text":"Delicious fine dining. Food is small portion sizes, but that's to be expected from French cuisine. Our bartender/server was knowledgable and provided fantastic drink and food recommendations."}
{"text":"Amazing place. One of the best restaurants I've been in my life. There's nothing else to say!

Even though the food is on the pricey side, the staff was very friendly and approachable. 

I had a wonderful time."}

{"text":"Good but we weren't super impressed.  We ordered the froie gras which was delicious and generous in portion but it only came with 2 tiny biscuits to spread on.  We also tried the poached lobster with veal sweetbreads which was very delicious but tiny portion of course. Skip the dessert there!"}
{"text":"This meal was truly outstanding.  Located on a fun strip with some other cool bars, it is a nice dose of unpretentious French food executed at a high level.  The sommelier was wonderful as was our waitress."}
{"text":"Everything we had in this restaurant was top notch! The sauces were one of the best I had In Montreal, innovative yet balanced. If you are a big eater or very hungry, you might be disappointed with the portions. However, for me, it was perfect. It is so refreshing to find a restaurant serving high quality food That clearly is prepared by very talented chefs.Definitely a go back place!"}
{"text":"Il s'agit d'un restaurant dont j'avais beaucoup entendu parlé au préalable. Emplacement idéal si vous avez un spectacle à la place des arts ou dans les environs. Nous avions mentionnés cette contrainte, et nous avons reçu un service agréable et rapide. 
Le restaurant se veut plutôt discret de l'extérieur, et peut presque passer inaperçu. Par contre la déco intérieure se veut simple, épurée et chic. Le menu est élaboré, et fusionne plusieurs saveurs et textures. Mon coup de cur a été sans contredit le dessert: gâteau tamarin, noix de cajou, chocolat, yogourt cardamome et mangue... un vrai délice! 
À découvrir!"}
{"text":"We planned a quiet romantic dinner, what we got was a noisy, expensive, rushed orders, small portions of good food, it was so noisy that we could not hear ourselves, you needed to really raise your voice above everyone else to be heard. The temprature in the restaurant was so high that we could not wait to leave. Not worth the hype, there are plenty of good food restaurants with character in Montreal and cheaper."}
{"text":"JE SUIS SOUS LE CHARME! 

Une ambiance épurée, un personnel souriant et accueillant et des plats bien présenté et tellement savoureux.

J'avais entendu plusieurs bons commentaires, mais j'ai toujours remis à plus tard d'aller y faire un tour parce que le restaurant appartient à des anciens du Leméac (restaurant que j'apprécie très peu) et parce que, bien souvent quand j'entends des tonnes de bonnes critiques, mes attentes s'élèvent et je suis déçue. 

Finalement, me disant que la blogueuse culinaire que je suis (la boufferie) n'avais pas le droit de ne pas connaître ce resto dont tout le monde parle, j'y suis allée hier, pour dîner avec une amie. 

En entrée nous avons pris la soupe et la verdure du jour. Habituellement j'évite de prendre les entrées du jour parce qu'on se retrouve toujours avec un potage ordinaire et une mesclun... Ici ce n'est pas le cas! Un potage d'asperge avec lardons et cornichons: délicat et bien présenté. Pour la salade: jambon de campagne et cantaloup était au rendez-vous!

 En plat principal, du canard confit avec nectarine et le summum: le doré avec champignons, bouillon, radis, etc.! Un délice! 

Évidemment, on termine une si belle expérience par des desserts: un pot de biscuits (5 biscuits mous, moelleux et chaud aux pépites de chocolat) et une crème prise avec chocolat dulce et prunes! 

Si vous y aller, commencez votre repas par leur cocktail: limonade maison, sirop simple, coriandre, vodka, vin blanc et soda! Ça goûte le beau temps!"}
{"text":"Amazing chow! Everything was wonderful. 
Oysters: fresh and well shucked. I would have liked a bit more mignonette...no biggy. 
Amuse bouche: can't remember but it was dope. My bouche was certainly amused. 
Appetizers: Duck tartar and octopus. Both incredible. Especially the octopus. 
Mains: venison. Tender and perfect medium rare all the way through...Scallops were tasty and expertly prepared.
Dessert: we shared the brioche and chocolate fois gras. Rich, unique and fantastic. 
We had wine pairing with each course. Check was around 3 hund-o but well with it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I went a few times and I can say aloud that this restaurant is one of the best in Montreal! Everything is amazing and also the list of the wines is pretty good! If you love amazing food I highly recommended Bouillon Bilk!"}
{"text":"The first night my friend and I arrived in Montreal, we had no dinner reservations but decided we would pick a restaurant within 15 minute walking distance -- the best decision we made. Bouillon Bilk is located in an unassuming building with a simple entrance. Amongst the soft lighting and modern decor, we felt undressed but knew we would eat well. And we did.

My vegetarian entrée of tempeh and roasted vegetables was heavenly; my friend enjoyed her steak. Yes, it is expensive but utterly worth it. If you travel to Montreal, eat here."}
{"text":"Un des mes restos préférés!  J'y vais avec des amis et c'est toujours une très belle soirée.  Le menu change selon les arrivages, on y fait toujours de belles découvertes.  La carte des vins pourrait être mieux garnies compte tenu de la qualité du menu."}
{"text":"The food was ok. We ordered the oyster, scallops and short rib. Already forgot the appetizer and the dessert I ordered. Not very impressive for that price."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant

En conclusion les plats sont très recherche et les chaque assiette était délicieuse
A essayer!!"}
{"text":"Une cuisine raffinée et un service hors paire. Littéralement, l'un des meilleurs restaurants à MTL!"}
{"text":"Keep these two observations in mind before you decide to dine at Bouillon Bilk. First. This is not a family restaurant. Second. Take your girl there if she truly deserves it. Reservation in advance is highly recommended. I tried shrimps as appetizer, Veal cheek and Steak as main dish and Pineapple ice cream as a dessert and enjoyed every bit if it. With or without a date  you will find the joy."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. The reviews on Yelp don't lie.. would highly recommend this place.

All of the dishes are incredibly unique and extremely flavorful. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Montreal and probably one of the best French restaurants I've been to. 

  Bouillon bilk has been on my list of restaurants to try for a long time and so so glad I got to try it before i left the city. I had the scallop as my main and my partner had the venison. My scallops were some of the most fresh and tender scallops and every bite was more delicious than the previous. We completed the meal with the rice pudding, which was the perfect ending to an excellent meal. 

 The prices were very reasonable as well, ranging from $10-$20 for appetizer and $30-$40 for mains. We paid around $120 for two, but the quality of the meal was well worth that price."}
{"text":"Déception
Nous avons pris le menu degustation avec accord mets et vins. Les portions sont ridiculement petites, ce n'était pas mauvais mais rien de mémorable pour une addition assez salée."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance and presentation of dishes. The choice in wine is outstanding, and accompanies the dishes very well.

The quality of of the food is excellent, though the menu should be more extensive and provide a wider variety of dishes. The servings could also be larger to better justify the price.

In the end, it was a pleasant experience with much to return for. However, make sure you enjoy your wine or this may not be the best choice for you."}
{"text":"You've got to treat yourself, because you deserve it.

Superb Canadian fine dining experience. Two and a half hours of creative and delightful flavors. I ordered the tasting menu. W-O-W!!! Exquisite. This is the chef's tasting menu in the order the dishes were servedt:

Lobster, gochung, green beans, sesame (My favorite)
Hamachi, yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel (Yes! That's amazing)
Lamb, zucchini, mint, eggplant, apricot 
Turbot, bisque, kohlrabi, almonds, mango
Scallop/Sweetbreads, artichoke, morels, green peas
Duck, foie gras, porcini, fiddleheads, sttrawberries
Zacharie cloutier 12 months, buckwheat, pear (Exquisite)
Chocolate cake, chantilly, brandy cherries 

Don't ever let anyone say that fine dining is akin to elf food. I left the restaurant stuffed, close to not finishing dessert. I'm not even going to try to describe how fantastic all these flavors were as I'm afraid I won't do them justice. All of the dishes were fantastic. My personal favorite was the lobster.

Service was attentive, friendly and highly detailed. Clientele was a beautiful spectrum from the casually unassuming to the dressed-to-the-nines crowd. It seemed all were there not for the scene but rather for a unique gastronomic experience. Superb. Superb. Superb.

If you are in Montreal, I recommend you visit Bouillon Bilk for an out-of-this world culinary experience. Call ahead to make reservations."}
{"text":"All courses were very delicate.  Decor is simple and crowd is heterogenous from the mom inviting her daughter for a treat to trendy hipsters. The crew is super nice and helpful . A winner."}
{"text":"Brilliant quality lunch. Fantastic taste in starters and mains, and almost excessively large sizes. At $15-20 per entree, this must be Montreal's best lunch value. Wines and beers are also surprisingly reasonably priced; excellent Sancerre"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best tasting menus I've had. Every dish was better than the next, and appreciated the rather generous portions for a tasting menu. The servers/staff are generally knowledgable and when unable to answer our questions, went back to gather answers for us. A must go to for those in Montreal and don't let the signage dissuade you from going in!"}
{"text":"Soo Good, original, tasty and beautiful!

Amazing sommelier and service. Not easy to get it, but so happy to be there. 

One of the best meals I had in Montreal for a while. It is in a \"spooky area\" but really worth it!

The food is fresh, well prepared, and delicious. Very interesting wine list. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the lobster appetizer, crab Ravioli and scallops entree. With the chocolate dessert. Portions are small if your not from MTL, but you will understand why because every bite is so jam packed with Flavor that you find yourself savoring every bite. If your looking for flavor profile adventure this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Mind blowing experience. The restaurant is plane jane, very simplistic and for a reason... this place is all about the food. If you want a \"gastronorgasmic\" experience, this is the place. I've been here on two occasions, both times with at least 5 other people and so had a chance to try pretty much everything on the menu (at the time) and not once was I let down. The place can be a bit pricey, especially if you hit the bottles of wine, but let me tell you it is an investment for your personal education. Amen."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  Nearly perfect."}
{"text":"The decor was nice. The service was good. The food imaginative. This is one of these places were you can be sure that you aren't going to be walking away with a doggie bag."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Montreal. This is equivalent to the best 1 Michelin star restaurant you can find.

Everything is beautiful, tasty and creative. The service is very good and the atmosphere excellent. Nothing too pompous here but it is still very nice.

The prices for the quality of food are very decent. 

A must try if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"I won't have enough word to describe the wonderful evening we spent at Bouillon bilk. We had such a nice evening from start to finish!! The staff was helpfull and cordial! We had the pleasure of discussing wine choices with their somelier and he was right on the spot.. Don't hesitate to use his services it is well worth it and he is really interesting. 
Now the dinner from start to finish was pure delight!!! Each bite was packed with flavor more extraordinary than the other. 
This restaurant was a big 5.. a must try for sure!!! Money well spent!!!"}
{"text":"The place is small, but very cozy. Service is very good, and the food is excellent. We stayed in Montreal for few days, and we came here for our anniversary. The food was so good we returned two days later. We tried beef, scallops, piglet, and ravioli for main dishes. We also had octopus for our apps. Everything was very good. Highly recommend beef, scallops, and octopus. We definitely be back when we return to Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service from start to finish. The Menu du Jour isn't written anywhere so don't hesitate to ask them again. Highly recommend the pintade and the chocolate tamarin cake. Their selection of local cheese is also a must try."}
{"text":"Bouillon Bilk is a perfect example of why I use Yelp.  I never would have found this place otherwise.  It's a French restaurant hole-in-the-wall located in a not-so-nice neighborhood but it is a hidden gem.  Everything else on the street was closed but when we walked into this place on a weeknight it was packed.

Somehow we were seated quickly and given menus.  The menu was extremely short which allowed the waitress to go through each item individually and describe what they were.  We asked if they could recommend a couple of bottles of wine and she advised us to wait until we had ordered our food so that she could pair the wine with what we ordered.

I got the venison which was a first for me.  It was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The wine that she paired with it was an excellent selection.  Later in the evening we wanted a second bottle and they actually sent over the person responsible for selecting all of the restaurant's wine.  His knowledge was unbelievable as he not only told us about the flavors of the different options, he also gave us a really interesting history of the different wine makers.

We stayed for dessert and shared a cheese platter and a carrot cake.  Both were excellent.  I would definitely return here again."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for pretty plating and a business class type of atmosphere, Boullion Bilk is the perfect spot. 

Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.  Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue. 

With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer. A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction. 

Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.  3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.  My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.  Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious. 

The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.  Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good French-Canadian place with fresh ingredients, this is the place to go. Their menus are always changing, so I always want to go back. Price is a bit on the higher end, so if you don't want to spend too much I wouldn't recommend. The staff is incredibly friendly and has great ambiance. Always a go to when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch based on a quick Yelp search of the area, and we ended up staying for two hours because the food was so amazing! The signage is a bit limited from the street, and the neighborhood is not where you might expect to find such a nice restaurant.

The service was phenomenal, and they provided an English menu and English-speaking waiter when they heard us talking to each other in English. The portion sizes were reasonable, so soup, two appetizers, an entree each, dessert, and the small cheese plate were perfect for two people. Each dish had lovely presentation and tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow quel belle suprise. Nous avons adorer souper a se restaurant."}
{"text":"My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk...

Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start.

It's packed. Always packed. So do make reservations. However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there.

I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made.

It's all started with perfect drink... 
Followed by bread and butter... 
Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived. My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing. It was delicious. 
But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress. I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece... 
I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me. shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation.

It was an amazing meal all together.
For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites."}
{"text":"Classy, no non-sense, delectable food and a decent wine-list. For a professional dinner, a friendly outing or a date - great place that will leave you Pleased."}
{"text":"Simply, one of the best restaurants in montreal! Bouillon Bilk offers modern French cuisine, in a simplistic and elegant environment with unassuming yet knowledgeable service. A solid, winning combination. 

This is not your run-of-the-mill restaurant. Thought and detail are put into everything they do. From sourcing local ingredients to reinventing classic dishes, you are always in for a treat at Bouillon Bilk. 

It's not inexpensive, but considering the quality and experience, it is most definitely well worth the price. Many trendy restaurants in Mtl have a much steeper price point, and don't come close to Bouillon Bilk. 

The menu changes seasonally, so whether you're in town for a show, have a business lunch or are looking for a quaint date night, I highly recommend giving this place a go!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of fantastic.

Pricey, but you get what you pay for. The server informed us that the main special was duck breast with truffle oil and shaved black truffles with chantrelle mushrooms, apple slices, latkes and parsnips... which was absolutely incredible. $38, but in a restaurant like this, you understand that the portion size won't be massive, but the taste will be out of this world -- which it was.

Service was good, vibe was cool -- classy, but not stuffy. Reflective of Montreal. Would definitely go back, but again -- make sure you're ready to spend."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? We were so lucky to have found this place and get a seat for dinner. It was the best dinner I have had in a while. 

Since Joe Beef was closed during our visit, we relied on Yelp to help us find another restaurant to dine at. Fortunately for us, we found Bouillon Bilk. I called to see if they had any openings and they stated they had some bar seats available.

We headed over there and lucky for us, they were able to sit us in the main dining room. I would have never guessed a restaurant like this was in the neighborhood that we walked through, but surprises are sometimes good!

We ordered the prosciutto and coffee amuse bouche. I have never tasted anything like it. It was simply delicious. the salty meat mixed well with the sweet chocolate and coffee. The coffee bits added a nice depth of flavor and crunch. It was the best bite. 

Then we got our appetizer. We ordered the rhubarb and foie gras. My God, the flavors there was amazing too. The creamy foie tasted so good with the crunch tart veggies they added on, and the sweetness of the rhubarb really balanced out the dish. I cannot explain how delicious it was. We were licking our forks to savor each ounce of food.

I ordered octopus and sweetbread. The octopus was cooked perfectly; it was tender and not chewy. The sweet bread was fried nicely. Everything on the plate had a purpose and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend loved his scallops and mushrooms. He was a happy camper across from me.

The desserts were the weakest link. For dessert we ordered a chocolate lava type cake and a banana cake dessert. It was both just ok, I had better versions of the chocolate dish in Seattle. Also, the banana dessert reminded me of a glorified banana bread. However, it still provided a nice, sweet ending to our meal. 

It was an amazing experience. I am sad that they are located all they way in Montreal."}
{"text":"Normally one for cheap, filling grub, I'm very glad my partner and I made the trip to Boullion Bilk for her birthday. The food (we ordered an entree and a main dish each) was some of the most delicious I've had in my life, no exaggeration. Never mind how visually pleasing each dish was; the balance of flavors, the texture, even the serving size were all just grand.

It's enough to make a person enter the finance industry, just to afford food like this on a more-than-annual basis."}
{"text":"Great restaurant overall.

Every single dish was impressive, rich and full of different flavors in great harmony.
Service is outstanding, all simple details were just right.
Loved everything. We enjoyed a lovely evening."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing but definitely on the higher end of the dining experience. The drinks and food were presented in a delicate and simple manner. The restaurant vibe is very intimate and the servers are all very knowledgeable of the menu. While the food was small in portions, it was very rich and heavy so definitely filling. Menu is on the pricier side, but was something worth experiencing every now and then."}
{"text":"Found this fabulous nugget from looking at reviews on Yelp.  The meal was even better than was described in those reviews.  It turned out to be just down the street from where we were staying, which was convenient.  I ordered the scallops diner, and my dining mate ordered the cod dinner.  Both were utterly amazing.  The sauce they paired both with was over the top wonderful.  We then ordered the peach upside down cake, even given that we questioned the description which included olives.  It was delicious, served with passion fruit sorbet and olive ice cream ( I couldn't find nor taste ANY hit of olive).  It was a perfect finish to a simply amazing dinner.  

Hard to find, but well worth the search, just look for the big yellow electronics sign, and then find the windows where you can see the linen tablecloths!"}
{"text":"I understand why this may be one of the best restaurants in downtown Montreal. I had a lovely dining experience with my family. Though it may be situated in somewhat of a sketchy area, the food and service was amazing. We ordered a dozen of oysters to share and my..were they delicious. There were three different sauces that were served with the oysters and they were all so delightful. My favourite was the rhubarb and vinegar flavoured one. I ordered the walleye and it was delicious. The beef by far is my favourite dish. Every bite was an explosion of flavour. The linguine was also delicious in the truffle sauce. The shrimps in the linguine were mediocre. For dessert we got the arlette. It was also very delicious and ended this lovely night on a sweet note."}
{"text":"Everything was outstanding. The food options and preparation are super inventive with surprising flavor combinations. We ordered the hamachi appetizer (with grapefruit and yuzu) followed by two entrees - salmon (divine with a kind of Indian curry sauce) and guinea fowl (with radish, lentils and greens). The salmon was seated gently. No fishy taste and perfectly tender. The guinea fowl was so succulent. We paired it all with a glass of local Chardonnay and didn't even have room for dessert - likely because we'd OD'ed on the bottomless basket of homemade sourdough bread. Everyone from the host to the server were extremely kind and attentive and new the menu inside out. The restaurant was full of smartly dressed diners, across age ranges, even one family with well behaved children. As mentioned by other reviewers, the acoustics are poor and it gets a bit noisy when every table is filled. So go early."}
{"text":"My mission is to dine at as many Canada's 100 best restaurants in 2015; Torque is closed on Mondays so Boullion Bilk it was ;)

I was a single, walk-in diner and was seated at the bar. If more than 2 of you best to make a reservation. The bar staff were attentive and accommodating. I was looking to try a variety of dishes, sticking with starters was my best bet.

With a glass of muscadet - my own tasting menu:
1st - half dozen East to West coast oysters with 2 mignonette sauces and fresh grated horseradish : one spicy/sweet and one vinegary sauce both paired well with the oysters. Top marks for freshly grated horseradish!! 
2nd - hamachi, yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, cucumber : delicate and light, the combination of flavours was interesting with some bitter pays of the grapefruit 
3rd - lobster, peanuts, persimmon, daikon, coriander, wild rice : different textures with this dish, soft and crunchy, lobster cooked to perfection
last - chocolate crème prise, coffee, cashew, elderberries, ricotta ice cream : rich and decadent, candied cashew was the best part 

I would love to come here again with my family. A family of 6 across from me ordered a few of the same dishes and they were served family style. Don't be intimidated by the neighbourhood the restaurant is located, it's a definite must try when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Seriously underrated restaurant in Montreal. The food is always seasonal, impeccably executed and beautiful. If you work in the area and are usually at a loss of where to have a great lunch, Bouillon Bilk is a fantastic option. Only con: ambiance is lacking a bit. It's quite cold and modern looking, which may turn some people off this restaurant for specific occasions. However, if that wouldn't bother you, this is a top pick."}
{"text":"Dimanche soir, 2 personnes, au comptoir.
Menu dégustation 8 services.
Excellent service, personnel agréable et attentionné. Accord vin 5 services, surprenant, en dehors de ce qui se trouve en SAQ, vraiment très intéressant. En particulier plusieurs vins non filtrés, super originaux et en parfaite harmonie avec les plats. Portions petites pour chaque service, mais après 8 services nous étions tous deux rassasiés. Chaque plat est bien monté, délicat, original. Délicieux. Mention spéciale au pain, vraiment excellent.
Une très belle soirée!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. The food presentation at this restaurant is beautiful, and it tastes just as good. This maybe a 5 star but although everything is amazing nothing truly stood out to me. Perhaps I had too much bubbles? It is a nice place w great service and food. 

If you have a show at Place des arts, this is where you should eat beforehand."}
{"text":"What a find! One of the most delicious, decadent, inventive and creative meals I have ever had.  It was a Saturday night and we needed to decide where to eat.  I looked into Yelp and found two reasonable choices near the hotel. Bilk was the closest and had delicious looking pictures.  I called and we luckily landed a table for four at 8:00 pm on a Saturday night.  We started our walk early in order to not to fall asleep while waiting since we drove up the night before from NY. We arrived early and asked if our table was ready. We were about 20 minutes early but luckily there was another table ready for us! yay! We were seated and ready to indulge.  The menu seemed small but it all sounded delicious and special.  The dessert section was as big as the appetizer section.  The entree section was the shortest.  The waiter came by quickly and explained he had a lot to tell us.  When he came by and started expertly telling us the specials, a look of wonder came upon my boyfriend's and his friends face.  The words that were coming out of the waiter's mouth seemed like heaven to them.  There was linguini with a quail egg bacon and, many items with foie gras and other mouth watering items described.  We ordered, the amuse bouche, 5 appetizers and an entree each. The appetizer all came together first, (the waiter forgot the amuse), we were so full and happy with all the appetizers that we did not need the amuse. The appetizer were all creative and delicious.  I felt like a judge on Iron Chef with the privilege to try such inventive yet tasty dishes.  I've eaten at many fancy restaurants in NYC, but so far none as been as wonderful as this experience and for the very affordable price.  The entrees were equally awesone. We all dug in and smiled throughout the wonderful meal. Every bite felt like a flavorful delight to our taste buds.  I mentioned to the waiter that it was ok not to give us the amuse..he apologized for his mistake with a cookie jar of delicious chocolate and white chocolate cookies.  We ordered espresso and a foie gras dessert at the end and it put our meal over the top of awesomeness. The espresso was strong and flavorful and the foie gras dessert was amazing. The pomme cake with foie gras on top was a ridiculously brilliant invention.  Savory and Sweet mashed together into a heavenly taste.  We would come back ready to try this Chef's new menu. As I understand it is always changing but always amazing.  So if you are in Montreal, I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is exquisite and the food is intensely flavored without being too overwhelming in grease. This has to be one of my favorite new restaurants when I visit Montreal. 

I only had lunch. The soup was good and paired well with the smoked mackerel. The poutine was a bit overwhelming, but not in the slabs-of-foie-gras overwhelming like Au Pied, but sort of flavor wise, a little too much between the scallions and the turkey confit that seemed to overwhelm rather than mesh together. Still, it was really really good. 4.5 rounded up."}
{"text":"Went with a large group of friends and they were able to accommodate us all and keep our orders straight! You really do get what you pay for. It's a bit on the pricey side but well worth the experience"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in town. Seriously. Every time I'm amazed. The scallops will make you cry joy. It's all amazing."}
{"text":"Almost 3 years later and this is still in my top 3 restaurants in town. Every dish has an unbelievable and perfect mix of flavours. Tonight the best part of my meal was this truffled shrimp linguine. Unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing - the highlight of our visit to Montreal! The food was delicious and the service impeccable."}
{"text":"After all the hype, I was really expecting to be blown away by this place. But for the price point, I was totally disappointed. 

Let's start with the good: the food really was incredible and imaginative.

While I was deciding on my order, I had the G&T no. 2 off the cocktail menu. A nice, strong g&t with tea-infused tonic water. Loved it.

I started with an amuse-bouche consisting of beef tataki with gochujang mayo and some shaved radish. The beef was cooked more than I would have expected for a tataki, but this was delicious nonetheless, and a generous portion for an amuse-bouche.

My appetizer was the mackerel with sweetbreads. The mackerel was absolutely gorgeous and paired beautifully with the plums, asparagus, sea beans, and dashi butter on the plate. The sweetbread, however, was an unwelcome attendee to this party. It looked like a chicken nugget, and tasted like Chinese takeout. It really didn't belong on this plate, and certainly not drowned in dashi butter considering it was already quite greasy. Points for creativity and unexpected combinations though.

I chose the venison for my main course. This portion was generous (seriously, I don't understand why everyone keeps complaining about the portions at this place; I found them to be perfect), and the venison (which I was told was slow-cooked over 2 days and served medium rare, though I found it to be medium, slightly more than I would have preferred) was served with brussels sprouts, pearl onions, a rösti with a dollop of labneh, and a juniper berry sauce. This dish was PERFECT-- except for the fact that it was lukewarm at best when it reached me.

The biggest issue here aside from my main course being cold was the service. This place was clearly understaffed; my waiter was lovely and was doing his best, but I was not getting what I wanted when I wanted it. I was planning to have a glass of wine with my main course, but I didn't see my waiter once between when I received my appetizer and when I finished my last course and asked for the check. That's at least 30 minutes. Totally unacceptable. Venison isn't the same without a glass of red wine, folks.

Certainly a minor thing, but the decor felt pretty shabby too. No decorations or anything, just sterile white walls and a black bar.

If you want a restaurant of this caliber, price point, and level of creativity, check out Hôtel Herman over in Mile End instead."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service.

Food was creative, interesting, and cooked very well. The bread was especially amazing. We couldn't get enough of it!

Service was fast and attentive. They were helpful with menu descriptions and suggestions."}
{"text":"The food was simply amazing! My boyfriend and I started our meals with two of the appetizer specials. I had the shrimp tossed in a cream and served over an heirloom tomato while he had the ahi tuna roll which was fantastic. For the entrees, I had the scallops which was the BEST I've ever had!! Prepared to perfection I enjoyed each and every bite! He had the beef prepared medium rare which he thoroughly enjoyed as well."}
{"text":"After two separate lunches here, I will go on record and say the food here is superb. Next step is going for dinner. I'd recommend Bouillon Bilk to anyone who considers them self a foodie."}
{"text":"My friend came to Montreal from Toronto yesterday and we went here for dinner around 9pm. It was crowded and everyone seemed to have enjoyed their food. We ordered the tasting menu and we loved it! The sequence of the food was delicate because we experienced layers in the taste. Every ingredient went well with each other and we felt that the food was carefully designed and prepared. The dessert, the dark chocolate cake, was fantastic! The best chocolate cake I've ever had. With that being said, the service was not prefect - it was pretty good but not perfect. When the waitress took away our empty plate and dinnerware, she forgot to give us new ones. When I told her I didn't have a fork, she only brought a fork for me without paying attention to my friend who didn't have a fork either. Also, the wait between two courses was a little long. Anyways, my friend said it was among the top five among all the restaurants he had been in the world, which was quite a compliment."}
{"text":"I really liked my dessert (the sable) it was definitely the highlight of the meal. In terms of the mains, my scallops arrived cold and over salted, and my boyfriend said his fois gras was just \"fine\". The atmosphere was extremely loud (similar to a high school cafeteria) and it was interesting having my waiter shout the specials at me. Not at all what I would expect at a restaurant of this type but might be fun if you're a large group and not on a date."}
{"text":"Highlights - get the sea urchin and save your bread for the sauce, excellent!   Duck breast was very good.  Should have done the fresh crab instead of the hamachi, but that was still good.   We also had the special Ginny Fowl with the chicken liver sauce which was very good.  Chocolate coffee dessert was also tasty, but I should have ordered the peach carmel.   Can be noisy, we were sat in the back which was nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in downtown Montreal. My friends and I went there this July for lunch. We were going to try the tasting menu, but we were told that the tasting menu was only available at dinner. 

The interior decoration style of this place is simple and tough. It generates a clean, serious, and quiet dining environment. I believe it would be an appropriate location for business meals. But the spaces between some tables are too close, which decreases the privacy. 

We ordered 2 appetizers and 6 main courses to share. Most of the dishes tasted really good, and they were all in good looking. However, the octopus was not cleaned up very well, it tasted really sandy and fishy. But the server quickly replaced this order with a well-cooked new one. 

The service was good but not perfect. The server made a great recommendation for my drink, and I like it to go with the veal."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals in recent memory, and actually better than another $200/plate restaurant. I loved the ambiance, upscale clientle, their willingness to work with a vegetarian (and deliver on the culinary side). They explain the dishes when serving, which is nice. Bring your date, bring business colleagues, or go for yourself (as I did). A+"}
{"text":"We had a truly delicious meal here from beginning to end. The tartare was the best I've ever had and the butter sauce that goes with the scallops is what all butter sauces should taste like.  The Cornish game hen was delicious but I'd order it again for that incredible smokey potato puff thing that came with it.  When we come back to Montreal, this will certainly be on our must return list."}
{"text":"All in all, a good meal. The waiter was useless when making wine recommendations which wasn't pleasant. The other sommelier/waiter was far better at his job. Apps were very solid. Started with goat cheese melon salad that was delicious. Other starter was linguini with rabbit and snails, just excellent. Both meals was lobster pasta (name escapes me). It was interesting. Mixes of sweet and savoury. Still not sure what to think. Both dessert were delicious but the apple cheese cake was probably the best dessert I had this year."}
{"text":"Having walked about 30 minutes in the wrong direction absentmindedly, I completed my long hike to Bouillon Bilk. In Montreal for a conference, it was dinner for 1, with my trusty friends The New Yorker and The Economist my only companions. I was delighted to find that the restaurant has seating along both sides of the large central bar, ideal for the lone rangers among us. 

The decor is unpretentious and minimalist without being sterile. The use of high and low tables helps make the dining room dynamic. For its small scale, it has a sense of theatre. 

My server, Naomi, was lovely and attentive. As she explained the specials it became clear that this is a restaurant that constructs dishes with many elements-- varied ingredients, garnishes, sauces-- it all sounded very ambitious. 

I ordered the duck, with cherries, brown rice, snow peas, a mustard reduction, and topped with seared foie gras. On the side I ordered a special of various Quebecois mushrooms, apparently in season. 

Some hearty country-style bread and an excellent local Pilsner tied me over until the main courses arrived. 

To get to the point, the food was excellent. Better executed, more satisfying, and more delicious than most similarly \"ambitious\" eateries in New York. With all the things happening on the plate, every bite was so well balanced-- savory and sweet in a killer combination. 

Dessert was also on point. They kindly accommodated my request for a simple bowl of ice cream-- scoops of both homemade sesame and coffee flavors, at once delicate and rich. And as Naomi explained, the chef couldn't just send out two scoops ungarnished, so the bowl had little pansy petals sprinkled on top. 

I highly recommend the restaurant for those who want to instantly confirm that Montreal is a city with a serious and apparently thriving food culture. And importantly, aside from the food, the atmosphere is convivial and relaxed. 

It was worth the hike."}
{"text":"This was our last dinner of a short holiday in Montreal, a wonderful recommendation from our concierge. We had some great hits for dinner almost every night so our expectations were definitely high, and Bouillon Bilk exceeded that bar. I had the guinea fowl with foie gras and it was delicious, juicy and tender. Hubby had the linguini with seafood, yum. The service was friendly and our waitress was sweet as can be."}
{"text":"It really is the best restaurant in Montreal. I went there with my girlfriend for our 1 year anniversary, breaks the wallet but definitely worth it! 
I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and the prices were amazing. I had pigeon meat for the first time, which I ended up not liking too much because it was too greasy. The soup was pretty flavorful in all. They use a lot of ingredients that I was not used to. If you enjoy french cuisine, then it might be a go for you. The service was good."}
{"text":"The restaurant is easy to miss and nondescript but what lies inside is a remarkable dining experience that awaits you.
We were impressed the moment we stepped inside. The host was warm, congenial, and incredibly professional. He made us feel welcome, offered us some choice seats, and had us comfortably seated in moments. The wait staff was superb and congenial as well. 

The food was EXQUISITE. The dishes were creative and incredibly delicious. Everything was artfully plated. The plates were a perfect portion unlike the indulgent serving of other places we went to in Montreal. My husband and I had 4 plates of food and for the first time in our trip we were able to eat everything.
-Duck Tartare 18
With foie gras shavings, coffee, dates, jerusalem artichoke, trevisio, kamut, and hazelnuts.
This was absolutely divine. The entire dish melts in your mouth. Hazlenus with duck and foie gras is a revelation and one of the best things I have tasted.

-Mackerel 18
With crisp fried sweetbreads, white asparagus, dashi butter, plum, samphire. Simultaneously light and rich. This is beautiful to the eyes and taste buds. 

-Venison 34
With rösti, cabbage, labneh, juniper, honeyberries, yellow foot chanterelles.
Hearty, flavorful, and oh so satisfying.

-Cornish hen 30
With liver, fava beans, morels, bacon, fiddleheads, apple, mustard. 
I gave my husband shit for ordering chicken but it was perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, and seasoned beautifully. All the ingredients just worked. 
There's a great wine selection  but we were happy with our beers. The pils cauwe (pronounced cow) and brune reserve was great.
We wanted to do the 8 course tasting menu but decided against it. We were informed that it would take about 3 hrs or 4 hrs, something like that to complete. We had a long day and a eventful itinerary for the next day so just ordered a lot of food. If you want to try the tasting menu set aside time for it. Everyone in your table must participate. 
We had a great time. I would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing New Year's dinner! One of the top 5 I ever had.
Creative fresh food, spot on wine pairing (and very generous pours!). Perfect service (it was a pleasure seeing them work behind the bar).
Can't wait to go back. Perfection at every level."}
{"text":"They deliver a very refined, high-end experience for a reasonable cost. There's a lot to like; the service is impeccable and the dishes are unique and beautifully prepared. That said, I felt like the flavor of the food took a back seat to all the pomp and circumstance."}
{"text":"OK I know I am spoiled, I am from SF area, I am a cook, a chef, in this food business for 2/3rds of my life.  I am telling you that I've been disappointed so many times in Montreal restaurants; I don't even write about the restaurants if I am disappointed that's why I don't have many reviews about Montreal restaurants but here I am now.  

Try this one.  It's been opened for little more than a week.  The view from this restaurant isn't good at all - dreadful construction site you have to see while you are eating - but inside of this restaurant is cool and hip.  And of course you have to judge the restaurant with their food right?  OMG, ok the salmon burger and Bailey's cream brulee was fantastic.  It's not easy to find a \"Salmon Burger\" that you just bite a one and say WOW  so here we are.  :)  

Have you ever tried MSG over load Poutine in QC and got disgusted?? If you've been disappointed, you should try their Poutine here.  I bet that they use real stock for the poutine!  Delicious!  

Oh well, I have to go there again and try more times to say something very fair but the first impression?  Absolutely you should try.  Oh Oh Oh!  Did I tell you that there is nowhere to go around Place d'art?  so try it! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were thoroughly satisfied with the experience at Bouillon Bilk. We had called ahead to reserve a spot at the bar for dinner as they do not take walk-ins. Arrived around 9:30pm and the restaurant was packed with beautiful people that were beautifully dressed, us on the other hand were a little under dressed, though no one gave us any trouble for it, we just felt a little out of place, which was completely our fault.

The food here were just absolutely awesomeness. FYI tasting menu isn't available after 9.. so we tried creating out own.. Appetizers: Raviolis, Foie Gras, Sea Urchin. Entrées: Scallops, Steak. Finished off the night with the strawberry cream dessert. 

Everything we had were really good, and the atmosphere was definitely classy and romantic. We'll definitely return, but next time, appropriately dressed."}
{"text":"The food is really good but you gotta stay away from dishes that have Asian inspired tastes and influences. The restaurant excels at making traditional french cuisine. 

It is pretty pricey at the high end of $$$ category."}
{"text":"IN SHORT:  3.25/5
Much lauded new Canadian food does not live up to the expectation beyond yet another new restaurant serving dainty little portions on cleanly presented plates lacking soul and flavor.


FOOD:  3.5/5
\"lamb, vadouvan, olives, eggplant, halloumi, apricot, cabbage\":  elegantly simple.  Clean on palate
\"halibut, broccoli, grapes, hazelnut, shiitake, fingerling potatoes\":  halibut poached and fried.  Again, clean, simple, and tasty.
\"beef short rib, whelk, asparagus, radish, gnocchi, bacon, apricot\":  Beef presented in 3 discrete cubes.  If the cubes are to be the best of the short ribs, trimmed of all the non-tasty parts, then the dish missed the mark as our table mate had a plateful of fatty grissels.

AMBIANCE / SERVICE:  3.5/5
Crowded dining room with loud white noise background, consequently conversations from the neighboring tables are drowned out.  Service is courteous, professional, and pleasantly bi-lingual (French / English) without condescension.

LOCATION / PARKING:  3/5
Parking is metered city street.

WHEELCHAIR ACCESS:  0.5/5
4 steep steps without railing and a tricky door opening makes this at least a two helper manual wheelchair entry.  One of the three bathrooms has a slightly larger door (~2.5') but no larger interior for a turn around."}
{"text":"Great experience overall. 
The menu is very thought of and structured. Can really show how much the chef was creative when they came up with the menu. I had the shrimps to start. They were on point, really tender with a little kick from the jalapeños but not that spicy. For the main I had the scallops. All I can say is that I would come back again for the scallops any day, any time. 
Fantastic restaurant and experience."}
{"text":"Diificile à trouver, bien cachée sous la vieille enseigne d'un magasin électronique.

Mais ca vaut le détour. Bonne bouffe, bon service, bonnes bouteilles de vin"}
{"text":"The reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is that the food quality is somewhat uneven. I went here for dinner and it was fantastic: all of the flavors were so expertly matched, everything converged into a really gorgeous scallop dish, and a delicious umami-infused lamb tagliatelle. But on another occasion, I had lunch here, and although the service was equally excellent, the food was not as good - the ingredients did not seem as fresh, the flavor combinations were less inventive. So I would recommend dining here - but be aware that it is quite expensive. Still, ambiance + food + service = a great experience, especially if you are in the mood for something on the fancy side."}
{"text":"I was actually really disappointed at this please. 

1. Their menu was really small. Personally i don't eat raw dish, so i almost had no choice for appetizer. 

2. I asked for recommendation for a red wine that was not too dry. The waitress gave me a recommendation but it  was actually really dry when tired it. I told her that was too dry. She took away the bottle and asked another bartender to help. However, i can tell her face gave me attitudes at that moment.
The bartender was patient and nice to let me try some other options but all of them were really dry. At the end, he told he didn't have any non-dry red wine on the by -glass list. If that was the case, they should have told me at the beginning. This was really not professional. I noticed the table besides me asked for wine recommendation and the waitress brought the same two bottles she recommended to me earlier to their desk. So i guess they always recommended the same types of wine to the customer regardless their needs, which was not what i expected at a fine dining restaurants at this. And I have to mention that after that, the waitress gave me attitudes for the entire night. 

3. The food was not, but not amazing. There was not suprise. You can have similar food at all other French fine dining restaurants.

I don't think i will recommend this places to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Dropped by for lunch and had the lobster bisque and lamb pasta. The favoring for both were strong, but I didn't mind. Tasted great. Portions are a bit light. Definitely would re-visit next time I'm in montreal"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best quality foods I ever had in a restaurant. Service was also very attentive. My first impression wasn't very good though, because the place was very crowded. The interior is very simple and the exterior doesn't reflect that it's a restaurant. I usually like a relaxed atmosphere with less people, and I prefer restaurants that have a cooler and stylish interior design. However, the food made up for everything that I considered as a fault before. This restaurant has a world-class cuisine. Hands down for the chef!"}
{"text":"Ok, Delta Airlines lost my luggage on my first day in Montreal for the jazz festival. I was hot as in mad as hell, but determined to have a good time. With help from the yelp app on my iPad, I found Bouillon BIlk. Lord have mercy. I had grilled shrimp with foam, fruit puree and beef bone marrow. Doesn't sound good but it was so yummy, I was'nt so upset with Delta. I had a red wine called, Air. It was so mellow and palatable, I almost forgot about my mishandled luggage. Main course was salmon tartar. Wonderful!  Dessert  was white chocolate mouse of some sort. Everything was splendid. Now, if Delta would only find my luggage. But if they  don't, I can say I had one fantastic meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here. I loved the food. Overall I would give it a 4.5/5.

We dropped in for our 8pm reservation. The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going. The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats.

Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger. However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables. Especially the single tables. Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate. They had a mix of different tables. Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area. Also some tables with booths.

Service 3.5/5
There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal. We didn't leave the restaurant until 2.5 hours later. They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out. And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out. Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us. They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice.

Our server was great at describing every dish. She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal. She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed.

Food 4.5/5 
Each and every dish was presented beautifully. Truly works of art.

Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious.
The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft. This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it. The veal tongue melted in your mouth. It was soft and not chewy. I loved the pear toffee reduction. The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste. The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue. 

We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much. The scallops came with clementine and parsnip. Scallops were fresh and succulent. The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice. 

The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night. I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish. It was that good. This was accompanied by beets and plums. That were sweet and delicious. Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish. Very pretty to look at. 

Main
Venison with hedgehog mushrooms. Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly. The meat melted in your mouth. The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all. The inside was still pink and juicy. This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.  The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together. I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering. 

My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions. Steak was soft and pink in the centre. You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through. This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night.

We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share. I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream. Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip. It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be. It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate.

I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Dispendieux mais excellent. Service parfait! Drinks excellents! Plats vraiment au dessus de ce qui se fait à Montreal. Hautement recommandé!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Best meal in Montreal.  Restaurant was recommended by hotel concierge.  We went for lunch and from beginning to end it was amazing.  Food was delicious and thoughtful, staff was excellent, and ambience was modern and minimalistic without being stuffy.  Place doesn't look like much from the outside but it was fantastic.  For lunch it was approximately $50 per person including alcohol which was very reasonable.  Try the poutine, and gnocchi entrees."}
{"text":"On our first evening of a short trip to Montreal, we enjoyed our dinner this restaurant immensely.  Although located in a bit of a dodgy area on St. Laurent, once inside the restaurant, the scene is set for a fantastic meal.  The décor is spare yet well thought out, and the ceiling design seems to work well to keep noise to a minimum.   

Two tasting menus are offered, yet we skipped those in favor of the a la carte menu, starting with fresh oysters from PEI, followed by the Hamachi appetizer.  We really enjoyed our main courses which were the guinea fowl and linguine dishes, both of which were expertly prepared and presented.  And dessert is not to be skipped either.

Our service was professional, friendly, and timely without any sense of making us feel rushed.   We enjoyed a few opportunities for some conversation which seemed genuine and engaging.   The sommelier, Joseph, provided excellent advise regarding the outstanding wine list.

Overall, an excellent experience...we'd highly recommend Boullion Bilk."}
{"text":"Bouillon Bilk is simply amazing! Food is always perfect, nice wine selection and staff is smiling and accommodating. This pint size restaurant is definitely a must try. I have been several times and every time was perfect."}
{"text":"Mmmmm delightful meal! 

Had the lamb tartare and the lobster linguine. So good!! The portions were quite small as these dishes were appetizers. But...quality over quantity for sure. The lamb was beautifully seasoned and with the perfect garnishments (including dif textures such as crunchy and soft). The lobster in the linguine tasted fresh, but hands down the lamb tartare stole the show.

For dessert, had the hazelnut financier - it was fruity with sorbet scoops. The sesame seeds were a nice touch. Also tried a bite of the tamarind cake, which was really good and had a complex flavour profile.

Quality of all the food here was spot on. Ambiance was on the fancier side with white table cloths. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Environment is classy... 
Service is not bad...

But one of my major concern is that I ordered oysters and there were small pieces of shells within the meat.... It was terrible experience!!! I've never had to pick broken shell piece off my oyster before... No offence but this needs to be addressed 

And my personal opinion this restaurant is over price... Not worth the money..."}
{"text":"Mon préféré à Montreal, le menu change souvent le staff est très compétent, j'aime le decor sobre et l'excellent service qui est orchestré au Bouillon Bilk. Excellent rapport qualité prix au vue de la qualité de la bouffe."}
{"text":"For our 1 year, my husband took me to a really fancy french restaurant called Bouillon Bilk , it took roughly 30 mins to walk there - this restaurant is located at a very sketch place. There were construction everywhere and homeless tents were close to the area... I seriously wonder why they decided to open a restaurant in this area?

The food was superb though, the service is also fantastic. The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps. So I said why not! I should had known...... tiny tiny tiny shrimps. Picture below. Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp. He was being very generous.  

I got the pasta. Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite. So I took little bites so my meal would last longer. I am not meant to eat at a french cuisine.My husband had the short ribs Equally as good.

The portion is wayyyyyyy too small for me. I would have to order 5 plates to fill me up!"}
{"text":"Things I like about Bouillon Bilk:

A) Everything 

I had dinner here a few years ago and was impressed, I can't believe it's taken so long to come back.  If it's your first time here, don't be put off by the location, on a rather gritty part of lower St. Laurent.  Yes, you are in the right place and will be ushered into a serene modern space where a friendly host will whisk away your coat and seat you.  

I was there for a work dinner so had to talk politely about lung disease instead of taking dozens of pictures of my food.  Please take my word for it, it's very very pretty. Absolutely gorgeous plate presentation.  

We took the five course tasting menu, consisting of sashimi, beef tartare, a pasta dish, quail and dessert.  Each course was superb.  The meal was nicely paced, taking about 2 hours to finish.  We were pleasantly full by the end. 

The sommelier recommended a very nice Italian red that was moderately priced and paired well with the tasting menu. 

Service was excellent, friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  

Bonus: love that this place is open on Mondays and is walking distance to Place des Arts.  Great spot for pre or post show dinner.  

I definitely won't wait so long to come back again!"}
{"text":"Bouillon Bilk is truly a gastronomic gem of Montreal! It's a bit hard to find, tucked away in an otherwise run-down area and un-noteworthy part of town. Francois Nadon is truly one of Montreal's best local chefs and his food exemplifies Montreal cuisine at its best! All the ingredients are sourced locally and the menu changes according to what's available each season. For our dinner, my bf and I ordered the following:

[Appetizer] Fraises, cresson, pacanes, crème sûre, quinoa:
A salad composed of strawberries, watercress, roasted pecans, sour cream (made from goat cheese according to the english menu), and quinoa. Everything worked so well together on this plate! The strawberries added a bit of sweetness and tartness; the roasted pecans added some depth with its nutty, earthy tones; the goat cheese sour cream worked with the quinoa to smooth out the flavors and bulk up the salad; and finally, the watercress added a bit of crisp and brightness to the palate. A truly fantastic salad!

[Appetizer] Asperges, langue de veau, vadouvan, morilles, oeuf 
Asparagus, veal tongue, Vadouvan, morels, and egg (it looked like a quail egg but may have just been a regular chicken egg). I've never had tongue in my life, let alone veal tongue. Not usually an adventurous eater, it took quite a bit of bravery and willpower to stomach the tongue, even though, psychological trauma aside, it was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. Everything on the plate was a work of art! The asparagus paired well with the various sauces and purees that decorated the plate, adding a bit of earthy, grassy flavor to an otherwise heavy appetizer. I had never had Vadouvan or morels before; I still can't tell you what Vadouvan tastes like cause it was incorporated so well into the dish, that I don't remember having tasted it; The morel, however, wasn't my thing; I didn't know at the time that it was a mushroom so it just looked like a deformed pickle to me and tasted somewhat pickle-y too. The veal tongue was served on top of a moist, delicious, perfectly cut, square piece of bread and topped with a perfectly round, perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg. Cutting into it, the egg yolk ran delightfully down over the tongue and bread. There is a certain joy to be taken in beautiful, breathtakingly precise, gastronomic presentations. The tongue tasted like a cross between filet mignon and brisket. 

[Entree] Roasted baby rooster special
I can't remember what else was in this dish but the rooster was, in my bf's words, \"The best chicken [he's] ever had!\" This dish was a chef special for the night. With crispy, well-seasoned skin, and meat that was so moist it simply fell off the bone. The rooster was a delight!

[Entree] Canard, foie gras, cerise, kamut, carotte
Duck, foie gras, cherry, kamut, carrot. Obviously, foie gras was #1 on my list of things to try in Montreal since it's so hard to come by in the States. This dish, though, was much more than I bargained for! Intensely rich and again, impeccably, expertly cooked, the duck plus the foie gras was enough to constitute two meals in and of itself. The cherries and carrots provided a bit of sweetness to the dish while the kamut (which is a type of grain similar to wheat and rice) provided some substance to ground the fatty goodness of the duck and foie gras. The duck was flavor-rich and browned on the edges while remaining soft and moist on the inside. The foie gras, the spotlight of the dish, was fantastic! (Though not entirely my thing...) It was nicely fried and somewhat crispy on the outside, especially on the edges, which I loved (tasted much like deep fried bacon). The inside, though, was just super fattening. It was definitely delicious and expertly crafted foie gras; I've just decided that foie gras isn't really my cup of tea.

[Dessert] Banane, glace sésame, chocolat
My bf got (in english) the banana, sesame ice cream, and chocolate dessert. The banana came dipped in syrup, the sesame ice cream was delightfully creamy, and the chocolate was served both drizzled over the plate and as thinly sliced sesame-covered dark chocolate pieces.

[Dessert] Strawberry soup special (with tiny flowers, pieces of melon and cantaloupe, sprouts, and a dollop of frozen yogurt, I think)
Again, this was a chef's special for the night so I don't remember all too clearly what was in the dish. It was absolutely delightful though! (And a very welcome light end to an otherwise super heavy meal, seeing as how I ordered both the tongue and the foie gras.) I remember the soup being wonderfully bright and ever-so-subtly sweet, with floral and fruity notes. The frozen yogurt added some substance to the soup, creamy and tart; It was also obviously handcrafted frozen yogurt since I could taste some individual ice crystals (something I loved!).

Food: 5/5 -- superb!
Service: 5/5 -- top-notch! (the waitress even folded my napkin when I left it on the table to go to the br)
Atmosphere: 5/5 -- chic, modern space

Overall: 5/5"}
{"text":"Wow. That word barely describes my meal - I rarely write reviews and yet I am siting at the restaurant and compelled to add my opinion to an already full list of reviews. 

I dined solo at the bar - with a last minute reservation secured by yhe concierge at my hotel (thanks Josh!). My meal was amazing. I had what seem to be the 2 signature dishes - the food gras appetizer and the scallops for the main. Both were out of this world. But the best was the scallops. Perfectly cooked with a sauce that kicked them into the next stratosphere!  

No room for desert, but I am leaving more than satisfied."}
{"text":"Terrific experience!

Had the five (5) course tasting menu with wine pairing and was extremely pleased.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was able to secure a reservation at Bouillon Bilk for a Thursday night at 8 pm. It was very crowded. You definitely need to make reservations in advance. The entrance to the restaurant is not apparent at all. The only way to spot the restaurant is to see the numerous tables through the windows then look side to side for the entrance. The restaurant is classic looking with white table cloths and servers wearing white button down shirts. The server was very helpful and was able to answer our questions. They were able to accommodate my boyfriend's gluten free allergy, which we were happy about. We ended up not doing the tasting because we weren't very hungry. I hope to try the tasting next time. To start, we ordered the hamachi in a sashimi style which came with fennel and grapefruit. It was delicious. The fennel really added to the dish nicely. For an entree, I ordered a walleye fillet. I never had that type of fish before and I was excited to try it. It came with peaches. The dish was great. The flavors were delicious and it was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the giunea fowl. It came with a sauce that was made with foie gras, and green apples and some pecans. He really enjoyed it as well. We were full by that point, so we didn't have room for dessert. Overall, we really enjoyed the food and would certainly return."}
{"text":"5 star experience at Bouillon Bilk which was all about the food!!! They had a really great menue featuring several unique dishes plated like art!!! I had the daily special which was homemade cavatelli with the most unique truffle and almond sauce which was one of the best pasta dishes I ever had! For dessert an apple and caramel Mille-feuille with a very distinct and strong green Apple filing ! I would describe decor and ambiance as minimalist but the restaurant feels crowded at dinner time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is basically what I wish Eleven Madison Park in NYC would be. Lots of diverse flavors packed into each dish, but all were well balanced and light. The dishes were very complex, yet tasted somehow simple. Fantastic dining experience and would absolutely come back multiple times. Great atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"One of the best things I've ever tasted in 33 years of my life!  I tried the tasting menu of 7 courses and every bite was phenomenal!  It was so great I had to come back the day after for another dish from the chef!  This is a true 5 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was our favorite restaurant in Montreal.

We arrived after hours of riding bikes. We were casually dressed, sweaty, and covered in dust; however, the employees at Bouillon Bilk welcomed us just like the best dressed folks there. We saw everybody at Bouillon Bilk. There were beautifully dressed people in the restaurant as well as a casually dressed family.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The front windows let in lots of natural light. The lines are straight and clean. The elements were modern. For example, the sink was outside of the bathroom and was long and communal. It was really neat and surprising.

And then the food. M ordered the duck. It was amazing. She let me try some. It was tender and melted in your mouth. It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens. It was a full song with harmony.

I got the cucumber salad. I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine. It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts. It was crunchy, soft, and light.

Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate. Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM. As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server. He encouraged us to linger and submit to the pleasures before us.

Our server also told us about our next favorite restaurant in Montreal: Hotel Herman. We would have gone to Bouillon Bilk every evening if the menu was more extensive. But that's some of the poetry of Bouillon Bilk. It knows what it can do and it executes it will finesse."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this spot since it's so highly rated on Yelp and recommended by a few of my friends. I know this place requires reservations in advance and I was beyond thrilled when my little sister took me to dinner here for my birthday.

Good: The space is intimate, clean and has a upscale ambience. The host was prompt to greet us and sat us at our table. The water was constantly refilled and each waiter was knowledgeable about explaining the dishes. Overall, fantastic service. I also want to mention that the desserts are amazing here.

Bad: *sigh* I really wanted to like this place...We ordered the tasting menu (one 7 course and one 5 course for 2 people), which is way too much food for the two of us. The plates were beautiful works of art with creative pairings, but didn't leave any lasting impressions. Not to mention, we stayed at the restaurant for 3 hours, waiting for each course.

Bottom line: This place requires patience and a big appetite if you want to try the tasting menu. I would probably only come back for the desserts though..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Quite possibly my favorite in the world mainly because whenever I go I am amazed at the complexity of flavors and the unusual and creative dishes that simply work. Every dish has a wow moment and the service is outstanding. Super trendy and I really like how it is hidden behind and electronics shop sign!"}
{"text":"so excellent and so not a burger place, as yelp has it listed. both service and food were above and beyond.

we arrived a half hour before closed and were uncertain they were still seating but they were very welcoming and seated us. our waitress also informed us apologetically, what they had run out of and that there was only one scallops dish left.

we looked over the menu and i decided i wanted to scallops but it was too late! someone else had already ordered them. but maybe it was meant to be because i got giant shrimp with sweetbreads (it's normally lobster but they were out of lobster and said they could do the same dish with the shrimp) and the boyf got ravioli over pulled pork. they were both so good!

(i'll add this since there are no dollar sign ratings on this place yet: dinner entrees run from $22 to $29, add glasses of wine, and i'd put this at just making a three-dollar sign rating [$$$].)

the ravioli was delicate and not over-salted, with the perfect, light sauce.

but my dish was the star! the sauce was rich and buttery, also not too salty, and so so creamy and aromatic. the shrimp were huge and tender, not at all overcooked, as shrimp often is. the sweetbreads were my favorite part. they were seared to perfection with cripsy edges that gave way to softness. we didn't figure out what organ they were. we thought they were maybe brains, from the way they looked, but later found out that brains don't usually qualify as sweetbreads.

our water glasses remained filled and we did end up being the last people there, a little past closing time, but our waitress still offered us dessert, which was very sweet (get it?), but we declined so they wouldn't have to stay even longer for us. but if i'm in the area again, i definitely want to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"This was sooooo good. Just what we needed go a late night meal. The marinated beef ribs melt in your mouth. Nice atmosphere- pleasant but not stuffy."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious but it took forever. And then some. Three hours, even with our cajoling.  That's unacceptable. Maybe they were short staffed that night."}
{"text":"We have our Quarterly boys nite out with my hockey buddies.  I am usually in charge of planing the evening.   A lot of fussy eaters and not mostly steak and potatoes types.  I really liked the positive reviews on Yelp for this restaurant and thought it would be a little different - little out of our comfort zone.   Couple of the guys read the menu online and were really not into going.   Majority rules so we ended up here on a friday night at around 8pm.   Place was just getting full.   From the get go, we were impressed.  The waiter was EXCELLENT, he knew the menu like the back of his hand and took good care of us (one of the guys has peanut allergies).    

We had a few beers to start the nite... they have a unique list of micro brew, had the Pilsner - was great!   Then for the entré - i had the Pork Dumpling - it was outstanding!  Followed by the Ravioli with Lamb as my main dish, and again, amazingly good.   Another one of the guys had the risotto to start, it looked like he liked his plate clean!   

We all really enjoyed our food and ambiance of the place.  Very impressed with the service and food quality.  Highly recommend this place and cant wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Despite the early hour, dusk had given way to darkness as we made our way to the east end of the Quartier des Spectacles. We nearly passed the restaurant, ten minutes late in meeting a friend and claiming our reservation. Luckily, she had already arrived and was presiding over banquette seating towards the back. The restaurant was already filled (on a Wednesday evening!) as we squeezed into our seats. The front of the restaurant sported a large square bar with comfy seats surrounding it. The minimalist decor appealed to me.

The restaurant offers both a tasting menu, in addition to their regular offerings. I did not do my usual research and regret not giving that menu a try. What can I say? I was tired and did not want to sit through a 3+ hour meal. But I do regret it now, after having sampled the chef's inventive offerings and seeing how well our neighbors dined.

After exchanging Christmas gifts, we started with the dorado amuse-bouche. The small bites of raw fish were silky in texture and well complemented by the seaweed-wrapped pear and delicate, miniature mushrooms.

Next up, we all selected the appetizer special, a thick slice of pork belly with a light touch of barbecue sauce. We all agreed that it was delicious; I even thought it was swoon-worthy. The pork belly featured layers of silky fat, as well as tender meat, was well prepared and served with strong accompaniments.

I enjoyed the scallops for my main course. The large, pan-seared scallops were served with pear slices, puréed cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms, watercress, with a golden butter sauce. The dish was so lovely that I slowly savored each bite, concentrating on the delicate flavors.

Selecting a dessert to cap off the meal was difficult. We all ended up with something different. For me, I went with the stewed and diced pears, cake and honey ice cream, topped with millet cereal and sunflower seeds.

Service was wonderful. The server was responsive and explained each dish in detail, sometimes more than once, and refilled our bread basket more than once, as well."}
{"text":"We used TripAdvisor and Yelp to help find this place. We are so glad we did. The ambiance was nice, the food was amazing and the staff was kind and attentive. Oysters, foie gras, scallops, duck, and beef were just a few of the things we ordered. All were artfully prepared and kitchen staff came out to explain exactly what was on each dish. A sommelier helped pair wines.

The drinks however, were just ok. Small portions and somewhat unnecessarily strong."}
{"text":"Very impressed. It has a speakeasy feel as the storefront appears to be a divey electronics store at first glance. It seems they never removed the sign of the previous business, which could be seen as pretentious, but they have the goods to back it up. 

Excellent service and a really nice space. Almost a Scandinavian feel to the design. 

We went for lunch, and felt the value for what we got was extremely high. The food is a work of art here, both from a flavor and presentation standpoint. Everything was fantastic, and beautiful. And reasonably priced. 

The crudo (I can't remember the fish, as it was a special) was incredible. Cannelloni and fowl were very good too."}
{"text":"An odd find and a little away from everything... gorgeous food and menu....in love with this place. Melanie was wonderful...razor clam appetizer to die for...great service as well. Nice to see it being done right."}
{"text":"Tout simplement l'expérience culinaire la plus agréable vécu de toute ma vie. Le prix en vaut grandement la chandelle! Merci Bouillon Bilk pour la merveilleuse soirée passer avec ma douce!!"}
{"text":"I had gone to the old Bilk several times and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Now very impressed with the renovation that has been completed.  Doubles the size of the restaurant with a much larger bar area.  Clean and spare on decoration the space is great.  No change to the food.  I had venison tartare as a starter followed by corn and lamb ravioli.  All tastefully plated with lots of flavor and texture to play with.  the ravioli was cooked perfectly - a true al dente.  

I wonder if the clientele for the new Bilk has changed.  My general impression is that it is skewing to an older demographic.  But perhaps I just wasn't paying attention on last visits."}
{"text":"Recommended to us by the concierge at Le Westin. 
One of the better meals I have ever had.
Braised short rib served with lobster, peach slices,and veggies was incomparable. The chef made me a beautiful salad as an app even though salad was not on the menu. 
Everything our party ordered was beautifully prepared and presented. 
Our server, Naomi, was so pleasant and helpful. She even wrote down some of her personal favorite spots for breakfast and lunch in Montreal. 

Don't be concerned about slightly sketchy looking block this restaurant is on or it's very unassuming entrance. This is a restaurant capable of preparing a memorable meal."}
{"text":"After extensive Yelp research, the wifey and I selected Boullion Bilk for our NYE celebration dinner in Montreal. This restaurant is outstanding across the board - food, service, atmosphere. A \"top 10\" experience. 

The restaurant has a refined minimalist decor with a warm buzz of activity. Our server was exceptional and attentive yet unobtrusive. At least 2 other people tended to us as well (water, bread, folding napkins, cleaning and resetting table). 

But the food, oh gawd, the food. It's been a few weeks so the exact details are a bit fuzzy, but I do very clearly recall being blown away at each serving.  I tried checking the menu to refresh my memory, but its mostly new. 

I will 100% visit again when I'm in MTL next."}
{"text":"Awesome?very creative French meals. Wanna try more dishes when I travel to Montreal next time. Probably they may change menu often."}
{"text":"Before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago. That meal is now tied with the one I had at Bouillon Bilk.  Very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service. The beet salad is transformative. I also loved the lobster amuse-bouche, the scallops, the venison, the chocolate financier. This is a very special dining experience. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The Japanese-inspired French cuisine blend is a particular favourite of mine and this place is the prime example of a successful fusion. Most of the ingredients are of Japanese origin and skillfully maneuvered in the French style to bring out their most exquisite characteristics. Seating at the bar is comfortable, but the tables are set close enough to make the ambient din interfere with light conversation."}
{"text":"By far this was the best dinner that we had while we were visiting Montreal.  It was a bit difficult to find since it is nestled amongst mundane storefronts.

We started off with the risotto because of other reviews that we had read from yelp and also ordered the foie gras and lobster to start.

For entrees we ordered the scallops, octopus, and duck.  The scallops were perfectly done and weren't sandy.  I love duck so that was my favorite.

The meal eneded with the banana, sesame ice cream, and chocolate along with the grapefruit gelee.

The flavors of each dish play very well with eachother.  Our waiter was wonderful and present without being intruding."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant, but it's in a spot where you wouldn't expect it to be. Very romantic and good service.  The waitress even asked if we had any dietary restrictions, allergies, or things we did not like. 

Me and my fiancé started off with the blue fin tuna appetizer with grapefruit and other delicious items. 

I had the scallops which were served with amazing slivers of pear and mushroom. They were buttery, rich and well cooked. 

My fiancé had the duck meat and heart plate. His was slightly tough but still very tasty. Very strange to say but wouldn't be shy of eating heart again. 

Dessert was a peach upside down cake with citrus sorbet. It was refreshing and a great way to end the meal."}

I actually don't remember the other dishes quite well so I am only reviewing one. 

Asperges avec des moules fumee, fromage de chevre, caviar (appetizer) - 95%
The mussels were prepared really really well, and when all of the ingredients are combined into one bite, they just complemented each other perfectly. The mussels had another flavor too them, very subtle but strong enough to notice. I can't say anything more. One of the most memorable bites during our trip to Montreal. I should have ordered 3 of these.

The asparagus dish is actually an appetizer. $9. 3 of those and I'd be more than happy."}
{"text":"Did the tasting menu. Food was good but can't say it was remarkable compared to other tasting menus I've tries at these types of restaurants."}
{"text":"Definitely a highlight of visit to Montreal.  This place hits it on every measure of excellence: service, atmosphere, presentation, taste. The Guinea hen was a work of art on a plate: perfectly crisp skin, savory liver mousse, hearty chanterelles and sweet plums.  The venison and scallop dishes were equally impressive as was the ravioli appetizer and pumpkin cake dessert."}
{"text":"I love this place and I would love to return there again one day. 

We ordered two appetizers, two entrees and two drinks and the bill was quite hefty but the food was amazing. Every plate came like a art piece, dainty and whimsical. The staff is absolutely charming. They have a constantly evolving menu that follows the seasons. 

We got the lobster, the hamachi, the sweetbread and the beef (summer 2015 menu). All amazing! Their drinks are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs resto de Montréal. Le foie gras poêlé en entrée était parfait et les pétoncles excellentes. Les entrées sont légères et les plats assez copieux. Au niveau du vin il y en a pour tous les goûts et tous les prix. La décoration est très épurée et il n'y a pas de musique ce qui fait qu'on s'entend parler c'est agréable. Le service était également excellent. Je recommande"}
{"text":"Boy was our dinner at Buoillon Bilk the best meal we had in Montreal, maybe even one of the best dinners I've had, period!  We tried making a reservation the night before our actual dinner but it was completely booked. Now I understand why!

Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful, despite the confusing, yellow awning it stands under.  The interior is outrageously chic with plentiful seating and a cool bar area, where we dined.  Secondly, the staff is super friendly, in an unpretentious way.  Moreover, the food was AWESOME!  We ordered a dozen oysters to start with and to get our libidos going.  They were a mouthful, fresh and came with 3 sauces that one can do with or without.  For our entrees, we ordered the cod fish and scallops, both of which were gorgeously plated and delicious!!  My cod fish was so moist that it collapsed upon the stab of my fork (t'was a gentle stab).  The garnishments on the plate also paired very well with the fish.  The scallops were also perfectly seared with garnishments that complimented the shellfish very well.  We devoured every single last bit of our artistic entrees AND ordered the upside down peach cake with ice cream for dessert, which left us leaving the restaurant with nothing but satisfaction!

Thank you Buoillon Bilk for a memorable meal that made our trip to Montreal that much more amazing!"}
{"text":"love the ambiance. love the food. very creative and nice presentation. would like to see a bigger cocktail selection."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot, great food, service was questionable.  

I loved the food here. My experience from being greeted, seated, and waited was a bit hostile and uncomfortable. 

The greeters were friendly, but clearly giving my girlfriend and I very weird looks, as if we didn't belong in there. Like a \"yikes\" look. I tried to brush it off, maybe I don't dress very well...

 I'm not sure if being able to speak only English  has anything to do with it, but the waitress we had was quite rude. She had very little patience and walked away in fustration when taking my order. But later came back to speaking to us in a very stern way.

Overall, the food was great, but the experience was just a bit like walking in the wrong neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars, but the servers were a little hard to reach and a tad bit too uppity for my taste. My friend and I came here for our \"fancy dinner night\" while visiting Montreal, and boy was it good. I ordered the rabbit and ravioli. It was super tasty, though a tad bit salty. The star I think was the yogurt and passion fruit dessert, at $7 I felt like we should have ordered 2. It was small but so complex and delicious. Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting or even a local."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves its high ranking.  What a delicious combination of ingredients, delicately prepared.  Normally it would be a prix-fixe menu for twice as much.  Sadly, I haven't found one place in L.A. that is this good."}
{"text":"Amazing. Go here. EVERYTHING on the menu is super delicious. I got the scallops! And wow! I wiped my plate clean. We also had the oysters to start wow. Ridiculous how low expectations I had then BOOM! Flavour explosion one dish after the other!"}
{"text":"Really, really enjoyed Bouillon Bilk! The atmosphere is very trendy/modern, and upscale with an expansive wine list (the sommelier was a good resource).

Menu is relatively small, which I like, with about a half-dozen starters, the same number of mains, and some daily specials. I ordered one of those specials, the guinea fowl, for my main, and it was really, really awesome. The cavatelli appetizer with truffles and other goodies was also excellent.

This would be a five-star meal if not for the portion size, which is extremely small for a large price tag. A favorable exchange rate does help, but it's a lot of money for what you get (which admittedly is an excellent, excellent fine dining experience). Our meal for two people included two appetizers, two mains, one dessert, one cup of tea and a bottle of wine. Total price was over $200 Canadian, which was worth it for a splurge.

Definitely make a reservation if you're going to come!"}
{"text":"My favorite meal in Montreal. The vibe is a little more low-key and modern, it's not ultra fancy but they take food seriously here and it is seriously good. Our waiter was lovely and engaging and we definitely felt taken care of. 

Foie gras appetizer (5/5): a bit of a mishmash of cooked and raw, sweet and sour and savory elements to pair with foie gras, all marrying together so well that even my skeptical parents kept going back for more. 

Beef tartare (4/5): quite traditional and prepared very well. The beef is fresh so that it actually tastes less \"beefy\" and has a clean flavor. 

Strawberry salad (4/5): are all Canadian strawberries this full of strawberry flavor? Small but packing a punch, the strawberries were artistically plated with an assortment of vegetables in a light appetizer to celebrate the season. 

Linguine with shrimp (5/5): savory rich seafood flavor, nicely executed.

Scallops with cauliflower (5/5): I still dream of this dish, plump and firm sweet scallops perfectly cooked, cauliflower 3 ways (pickled, pureed, and sauteed), crisp pear, it was classic and so so perfect. 

Guinea fowl (5/5): juicy and well-seasoned, with luscious spongey morels and a square of irresistable layered crisp potato. Familiar but totally elevated and again, perfect. 

Profiterole (4/5): quite good but as with most profiteroles, difficult to eat and difficult to share. 

Arlette (5/5): the dessert that stole my heart. Barely sweetened and rich smooth very dark chocolate, a fluffy cloud of sour cream, and a crisp for texture. If you enjoy dark chocolate, mousse, and not-too-sweet dessert, definitely order this.

Dacquoise (3.5/5) and rhubarb (3.5/5): the weakest desserts, just nothing that special about them. 

Appetizers and desserts are small and shareable, entrees were a hearty portion. The menu has since changed a bit but order with confidence and go by your waiter's recommendations - ours steered us towards an excellent meal. For someone who is used to New York prices, the value was outstanding for this excellent meal. Also an excellent option for anyone who does not eat gluten, the menu has plenty of options."}
{"text":"Quelle expérience! Vraiment de dehors le restaurant ne ressemble à rien. Mais une fois dedans le décor est raffiné, l'ambiance agréable. Le service est super, le sommelier connaît son métier et conseille très justement. Les plats sont raffinés, goûteux et très recherchés. On reviendra!"}
{"text":"Pretty much a perfect dining experience. We arrived without reservations and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, as the place was packed, but that's a great spot to catch all the action and chat with the bartender from. We started with the amuse bouche of the day, enjoyed fresh bread and cocktails to start, and were blown away by the quality of our main dishes. I tried a scallop dish that had a delicately arranged variety of textures - shiitake, zucchini, fried leek. My date tried the bacon wrapped rabbit with shrimp, polenta, and apple, outstanding. I could not resist a dessert, though we usually don't have any room - the meals are not huge here but they are intensely satisfying and great value, as long as you're OK with things a bit upscale. 

There was no music but the vibe was still wonderful, the din of diners making up for the lack of song. The decor is stark, just simple with white on most surfaces and not much in the way of decoration. Bouillon Bilk simply doesn't need anything fancy to dress it up, the focus is 100% on the food and drinks. The service was excellent, and the hostess explained at one point that they've expanded the original space, so it's perhaps twice as big as the hole in the wall size that some of the other Yelp reviews I read described.

Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice dinner for our first trip to dinner and Boullion Bilk did not disappoint. Before I even get to the food, I have to say I was impressed that, within minutes of booking our reservation online, I received a personalized confirmation text noting details from the special comments section; a nice restaurant read and responded within minutes, in their secondary language, to a reservation. 

Then when we checked in for dinner our server commented about things we had noted; again, attention to detail. The food was all wonderful. With a chef-driven menu like this, you expect quality ingredients arranged in unexpected ways with every detail deliberately chosen, and this was no exception. Between us, hubby and I got the strawberry and tortellini appetizers, the scallops and halibut entrees, and strawberry and mascarpone mousse desserts, and the only reason I wouldn't order them again if I went back tomorrow would be to try one of the other delicious options instead. Service was attentive without hovering, and atmosphere was vibrant but still allowed for conversation. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice meal in Montreal and would definitely come back on future visits."}
{"text":"Upon entry I didn't think we would get seated as the place was packed, the amazing aroma made me hungrier.  Managed to get seated with no wait thankfully as I was ready to eat everything. Starter was a tomorrow gazpacho with burrata- a special apparently so glad I got to have it this time. For main I had the lamb dish with couscous. The lamb was tender and cooked to perfection and the flavors sure to satisfy my tastebuds. Definitely worth a visit and will be back!"}
{"text":"This food was expensive but exquisite. The server suggested some wine just out of the price range we have her (150-200)  I usually don't trust people who do this but I decided to go with her suggestion. It was probably the best wine I have ever had. Duck heart was amazing. When they say amuse bouche they mean it."}
{"text":"Tonight's food was definitely good. Lots of flavor and presentation was great. Drinks were also good something hard to find in Montreal. We ordered the foie gras and three cheeses for appetizer and cod and veal for entree. I loved the cod! The veal was ok wasn't a fan of the tongue . The desert was chocolate with ricotta ice cream! Loved That. Perfect for a date night in Montreal"}
{"text":"- BOTTOM LINE:
By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon)...perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years. Make reservations in advance. The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps.

- THE SERVICE:
We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant. The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised. Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table. THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it. The rest of the staff was awesome as well. The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal.

- THE SPACE:
Intimate but unpretentious. Great for parents, dates, and old friends.

- THE FOOD:
Amazing. Spectacular. Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable. Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras. The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras.

I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal. What an experience. The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty. I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey. My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever. I aspire to cook fish that well.

Overall, an amazing experience at this place. I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation...but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had the tasting menu with my coworkers. Was fun to all be eating the same dishes. Small portions but many courses. Fresh homemade bread at the table that they keep refilling. all the dishes tasted great. Almost every dish had a bit of a nut crunch, like cashew or pistachio. They ask to make sure no one has allergies first. Unisex bathroom, 4 or 5 individual toilet rooms. I would go again. A lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Husband and I went for a 4 day trip to Montreal over the holidays. Ate here on our second night. We decided to go for the tasting menu. Reasonably priced. The food was amazing. The ambiance, the food presentation, the staff....everything was great. It was a wonderful experience and was probably the highlight of our entire trip! 

Highly recommend! A must try in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"Incredible. Best scallops I have ever had- the sauce was divine! Great service. Would pass on the beef entrée though- it didn't compare to the scallops or duck. I also really did not like the bathroom situation- looked exactly like a college dorm and I was forced to look at a toilet from my seat... Super unappealing during an expensive, beautiful dinner. Yuck."}
{"text":"Our lunch at Bouillon Bilk is in a heated battle with our subsequent dinner at Liverpool House for best meal in Montreal. Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner. Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk.

We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated. Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning. So I think we made a good choice.

The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good \"American (New)\" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco. Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former.

Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch. For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which). All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was.

For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well. I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter. Again, both dishes were wholly excellent. Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went over for our anniversary dinner. Overall, the restaurant was great and the service was wonderful. Here are what we ordered and some suggestions for the owner and chef to improve upon on. There are definitely rooms for improvement both on the food and the restaurant itself.

We both order a fried oyster to start from the daily specials. $5 each. My wife enjoyed hers. Mine was really tiny. You could tell the size difference when the two plates were put on the table. I gave the bigger one to my wife. All I could taste was batter on mine and no oyster. I think they should leave the smaller oyster to serve fresh but to pick the bigger one for deep fried.

I ordered the lobster appetizer ($19). My wife ordered the tuna appetizer ($21) from the daily specials. Both were great.

I ordered the duck and foie gras ($35) for my main. My wife ordered the octopus and sweet bread ($34).

The foie gras was prepared and pan seared to almost perfection. It could be more crispy on the outside before it melted in my mouth to be perfect. Good generous portion for the foie gras. The duck breast, however, was prepared very poorly. It was very very very very very chewy. I googled afterward why duck breast would be chewy. Apparently, it was because it was not cooked enough. It was very red for sure and there was still a lot of fat left on the skin. The skin was not crispy either which meant it was not rendered properly to cook out all the fat under the skin either. I probably should have sent it back instead of forcing it thru my guts. I hope the owner and chef will buy more duck breasts to properly train their sous chefs on how to cook duck breasts properly. (I was wondering why the waiter had brought out a steak knife for the main course.)

My wife's octopus and sweet bread was prepared well although she was unhappy with the side dishes. The menu said it should come with grilled red peppers and eggplants which she liked both. However, neither made it to the plate. It came with maybe 4 pieces of green beans instead that she did not really like. At $34, they really could have given her more greens to substitute for the grilled red peppers and eggplant.

They could use some candles on each table for a better ambience too. The street entrance was littered with smoked cigarettes and empty beer boxes. They seriously could sweep that 5 x 10 feet area on the street right in front of the entrance before they open each day!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurant across Canada! We had the 8 courses tasting menu with wine pairing which range from sea urchin to duck . PERFECTION from start to finish! The flavors of each dish were unique and mesmerizing. The service is stellar and the atmosphere lovely! I would go back anytime."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal we had in Montreal!   This was the \"special occasion\" meal of our trip and so, I was worried that it might end up being just another overly hyped up restaurant. Thankfully the many 5 star reviews for this place are legit. 

As soon as we sat down at our table, we were excited to see that they offered a great 8 course tasting menu and thought immediately that we were going to do just that.  However, a few more closer glances at the a la carte menu (which isn't large by any measure) and we couldn't resist the temptation to trail off and make our own tasting menu roll out.  

For an amuse bouche, we went with the evening's special which included lobster, peanuts and daylilies.  Highly highly recommended.  Excellent flavor combo and we loved the nice added crunch from the peanuts.   

Moving on to the actual apps, we shared a half dozen of PEI oysters, the crab and the duck.  Oysters were freshly chilled and served with 3 different kinds of sauces; All very enjoyable and the crab had a bolder curry taste served in a spring roll like shape.  Plates were pretty in  presentation but also great in flavor.  Although I didn't try the duck myself, it received very high marks.  

For my main, I tried their scallops which was a larger portion than I'd originally expected. It came as 4 half silver dollar sized coins with a reasonable amount of vegetables.  Each and every bite was savored.  It was amazingly light, clean and fresh with the shiitake adding just enough of a contrasting taste without overpowering the scallops.   We loved the dishes so much that 2 other entrees were ordered, the venison and the quail!  When asked which was better, the response was \"It's like asking who you love more, mom or dad.\"  Enough said, all are must-haves.  

Last thoughts on this restaurant - Is it expensive? Yup.  Are the portions small?  Yup.  But are you going to regret it?  Nope.  It's definitely not an everyday place to go but if you're looking for an upscale restaurant that will make your taste buds sing on a special occasion, this one will surely fit the \"Screw it because I deserve it\" bill."}
{"text":"Great ambience and food in this Modern european resutaurant. Location a little bit shady though.:( Loud.Difficult to hear in this atmostphere so not good for serious conversations.

Popular amongst women. Only 2 guys amongst all diners when I visited :)

We had some baba au rhum, fraises, fromages, V Sauternes 2003,aubergine, limonadier, v.bourg and fichet. 

Not much in vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was so amazing! The presentation, the service and the food were exceptional and couldn't have been better. I wish we took pictures of the food before we ate it, but it smelled so good that we destroyed it in a few minutes) it was a bit pricey but totally worth it.
I will come back whenever I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delightfully fresh and light dishes. We came here for lunch and though the place was packed, service was impeccable and attentive - everyone was patient even though we had to step out a few times to take a phone call and lunch ran longer than expected. The tart appetizer was nice, though a bit too sweet for my taste, I'm sure others would love it. The fish was delightful, on a bed of grilled vegetables and an olive oil sauce that just let the seafood flavor come through perfectly. Don't know if it is worth TripAdvisor's 8th best restaurant in Montreal, but definitely a solid place. Best of all, very affordable for the quality of dishes."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fine dining, this is a great restaurant, however it lacks in atmosphere. It is very clean and white.
The food was quite delicious, but pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu and everything was way too salty!!!! Even the table next to us complained...
Very disappointing for a 300$ meal..."}
{"text":"We shows up for lunch today and we were almost turned away since we didn't have a reservation. The place was completely empty at the time, but 10 minutes later there was a crowd lined up.
We got a seat at the bar and were greeted by several friendly staff members.
I tried one of their local honey wines; it was delicious!
Everything we ordered was beautifully presented and tasted delightful... Soupe du jour, hamachi appetizer and the joue de porc entrée."}
{"text":"Bouillon Bilk is a small gem of a restaurant that is owned by Chef Francois Nadon, offering a contemporary twist on Canadian specialties.  The hubs and I came here for an early dinner, and we decided to have more of a variety by ordering off of the a la carte menu.  We tried the Beets (with smoked egg, horseradish, taliah, clementine, and cranberries; the beats were thin carpaccio-style, with lovely bits of ctirus-y clementine and the addicting mini sesame Asian rice crackers (that I could eat 24/7)); Scarpinocc (plump pasta filled with lamb, pistachios, olives, anchovies, and mint; this was okay, but the hubs enjoyed this); Hamachi (with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber; super fresh hamachi with puffy rice crackers and super fresh cubed fennel); Black Cod (with miso, daikon, dashi butter, cara cara orange, and fermented turnips; beautifully-prepared, the cod was amazingly fork-tender, flaky, and just so delicious - super juicy with the light dashi butter sauce); Scallops (with cauliflower, shiitake, pear, watercress, and beurre noisette - literally one of the BEST scallop dishes I've tasted - the scallops were cooked perfectly, with a lovely buttered pan-seared action going on to lock in its juiciness, and the beautiful complements of the cauliflower puree, the sweetness from the pear, and the lovely beurre noisette sauce); Beef (with raw chickpeas and a nice au jous sauce - the steak was cooked a perfect medium/medium-well); Rice Pudding (with vanilla, walnuts, juniper, mandarin, and clementine - this had a toffee-like crisp that was super tasty, and the sorbetto paired well with the rice pudding); and, the Foie Gras (with brioche, maple, caramel, pecans, black raspberries, and sour cream; definitely the decadent out of all the desserts).  Service was impeccable, ranging from Ms. Laurence, Mr. Eric, Mr. Jean-Sebastian, and Mr. Jasmine - all super friendly, welcoming, and attentive.  The restaurant itself has soft lights and has a chic sophisticated flair to it.  Just note that the restaurant is unmarked, so you have to look for a large yellow electronic store sign and for the door with the restaurant logo.  Bouilon Bilk was a great find! :D

{"text":"I was get a few back around mid December during a short trip to Montreal.  My reservation was for 7 but arrived early, and was promptly seated at the bar.  Despite feeling completely underdressed, and perhaps the youngest in the room, I feel I was treated no differently.  The service was amazing and the food was delicious.  I opted for the 8 course tasting menu, which showcased a lot of interesting flavor combinations.  Each course was spaced well that I never felt like I was being rushed or waiting too long for the next.  My three favorites, the venison, duck, and hiramasa.  I'm hoping to be back in town this August and will without a doubt make a reservation for dinner at BB when I do."}
{"text":"This is one of the best meals I've had in Montreal. In fact, it's one of the best I've ever had. I was already riled up from all the reviews and what other Yelpers were saying about this place but expectations were blown out the door.

You can tell everything was meticulously prepared. This is as refined as it gets. Anything from meats to fish and vegetables is cooked to near perfection. The flavours have all the trademarks of fine French fare; subtle, rich, balance and harmonies. I have absolutely no criticism regarding the food other than maybe the portion sizes but that is expected for a place of this caliber. This place is surprisingly pretty good value considering the quality of the food.

This place does get busy though so a reservation is recommended. Their wines are also sublime but that is expected. Of all the great eats in Montreal it's tough to stand out from the crow but this place not only does, it towers over others."}
{"text":"Oysters was fresh and delicious 
Special of the day Red Sea bass was
Perfectly cooked 
Restaurant have very nice appearance"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and after walking by the place 2 times, found the door and was immediately impressed. Great simplistic decor letting the service and food take over. Both were top shelf resulting in a great experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Boxing Day and loved our meal (Cornish Hen & Cappelletti). Delicious! The hamachi mixed with cream left something to be desired. I would recommend a spot at the bar over a table for a casual party of two. Call ahead. Reservations highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just because we're not dressed up doesn't mean you have to turn us away! What a low class high end restaurant. Just because you can say sorry doesn't mean it's ok! DIM WIT!!!"}
{"text":"Over hyped imo.

I had:
  Apperizer: lamb with berbere spices
     (So plain! Almost no flavour! No berbere for sure)
     Arrived as a tar tar (did not suggest this on menu)
     Now I love Tar Tar but this was very dull.
     Less than special.

   Main: beef, ceps, romano, french beans, apple
      The beef was a rare flat iron with little flavour
       Why do beef this way? So much more you could have done.
       Sides on plate OKAY but nothing any cook right out of school couldn't do. Technique simplistic. 
       Flavour profile dull.
       Very dull knife (had to cut meat with bread knife instead!)

  Desert: grapefruit
        Quite good. Some innovation

Oh and butter was super super hard and could not be spread. They brought better butter later 

Eat here if you are on a bland hospital diet.

My friend fared a bit better:
    Amuse bouche: sea urchin: delicious and fresh
    App: Hamachi: delicious
    Main: Guinney hen: tasty
    Desert: strawberry: bit sour

Overall service was excellent. 

I would rate my experience a 5/10 and my friend gave it an 8/10 but since it is my review it ends up 3 stars :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Presentation and food itself were both incredible. Unique and classic ingredients intertwined beautifully. Had a fantastic beet dish. Pretty great wine list as well."}
{"text":"Came here based on fellow Yelp reviewer's comments and was not disappointed.  Came here for dinner on a Thursday night with reservation.  I was almost 45 minutes late (I did call up to let them know) and the lady was very very nice about it and they kept my spot for me.  The place was buzzing with people and so noise level quite high.

I was promptly seated at the bar and the bartender patiently explained everything on the menu to me in English (and I meant very patiently, thoroughly and expertly).

I chose the pork belly in spicy broth for appetizer. Visually stunning and tasted just as good.

For main I had the the grilled artic char with artichokes, clementines, blood sausage, olives, cashews.  Skin was crispy, fish was cooked to perfection and again, visually like a piece of artwork.  Every bite with different combination of the accompaniments brought out new flavor combination.

Definitely would be back for more if I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Must try if you are around Montreal...managed to snag a lunch reservation and the staff was SO polite, attentive, and accommodating. The gnocchi entree was supposed to have rabbit in it, but since I don't eat rabbit, I was originally dismayed that I would have to order something else. However, they easily whipped up another veggie alternative and I was definitely impressed. The flavors were great...especially for the sweet potato w/ duck soup of the day, the New Brunswick oysters were pretty fresh but on the small side, and the osso bucco as well. The only thing that was a bit meh was that they took forever to deliver a second glass of wine and the espresso for dessert after. So we were all done with the chocolate orange cake dessert (eh....I think I could have passed on this hindsight) and waiting for the check by the time the espresso came. Oh well, still a really good gem and the exterior threw me off for a bit since there wasn't a big sign. But no worries, you're probably in the right place...all nice, sleek, white, and contemporary!"}
{"text":"I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration. Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say. I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine. All appealing and cool and lovely. The decor is extremely simple and clean. Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables. No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines. 

We started with the \"Quebec Cheese Assortment\" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15). Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible. I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options. We ate every single bite, of course. What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything.

For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter. Oh my stars, you guys. These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr. The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness. This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion. It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end. 

Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options."}
{"text":"This is one of the best food experiences I have ever had in Montreal... or anywhere.  Food quality... A+  Wine list... A+. Service... A+...  There is only one negative. I am all in favour of a trendy / elegant / sparse decor... But please think about adding some sound absorbing materials to the space.    Being able to converse easily with my dinner companions would make this place perfect... 5+ stars."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite meals in Montreal. A beautiful ambiance as soon as you stepped in through the door. Everyone was elegantly and tastefully dressed. Very extensive wine list with a very knowledgeable sommelier who chose the perfect bottle of wine for our group of 8 girls out celebrating our girlfriend's bachelorette party. We pretty much ordered one of every thing on the menu, but my personal favorite was the cold lobster salad. Everything was so artfully prepared, I almost (but not quite) didn't want to ruin the perfect plating. Restrooms with a unique shared handwashing area, where you could end up chit chatting with strangers also there to enjoy a beautiful meal. Overall had an amazing experience at Buillon Bilk and would love to come back again next time I am fortunate enough to visit Montreal."}
{"text":"After almost 6 years in business Bouillon Bilk has become a bit of a local legend among Montréal foodies. I have walked by this restaurant many times and because it is located on a somewhat sketchy block of few restaurants and many electronics and hard goods stores one must look carefully to actually find the place. There is no prominent signage but a close look in the window reveals a super sleek and buzzing restaurant. Based on the excellent reviews and word of mouth we have been saving a visit to Bouillon Bilk for a special occasion. The occasional arose when some highly food obsessed folks from New York City recently visited Montréal after a very long absence.

The evening's objective was an eight course-tasting menu accompanied by a wine pairing with each course. A splendid array of meat, fish, fowl, pasta, sweets and interesting alcohols awaited us. We are so happy to report that our table of \"been there done that\"diners was totally blown away with this incredible menu. It was a flight of fancy combining the best elements of contemporary cooking on the fly, Omakase, and classical French and Italian dishes.  

The first offering was a formidable amuse bouche, of blue fin tuna tartar/ceviche and was followed by three sushi-esque courses that rival the best sushi offerings that we have had in this city.  Razor Clams,yuzu kosho, peppers, peach and sesame. All these ingredients were elegantly minced down to size and decoratively placed back in the clamshell.  No rubbery razor clam going down here. This artsy longboat of clam went down sensuously. The wizards in the kitchen almost knocked it out of the park with this one setting the highest standard for the courses that followed; Hamachi with blackberries wild rice and cucumber; and artic char with dill, squash, nectarine, fennel and radish. They were just superb.

I will mention the ingredients of the next three courses in detail because they are so original and the combinations of taste texture and seasonings worked so well together. Veal with sea urchin, French beans, artichoke, and cashews. Linguini, shrimps, black truffle, fava beans and olive.  Venison, offals, strawberries , cauliflower, and shitake.  The veal with sea urchin was a not too abrupt departure from the Japanese influence of the meal up to this point.  The Linguine a perfect combination of home made noodles lovingly adorned by the other ingredients and soaked in a savory bouillon.  The venison was whimsical with just the right touch of strawberry sauce to balance the meat and the offals.

The desserts of Fig Tartelette and Pecan and Chocolate Soup kept up with the quality and creativity of the first 6 courses.

Of the eight wine pairings we surprised by the first, which was an artisanal beer of very complex flavors.  The wines overall were very good although we thought the sommelier was a little off on the selection of the red wines as they weren't quite up to the loftiness of the foods. The whites for the most part were more interesting and very drinkable. The repast ended with two very nice dessert wines a 2000 Gailliac Mauzac with tones of honey and a Monstrum Grenache of anonymous origin that closed this extraordinary event with a sweet and flavorful memory.

Bouillon Bilk is for certain the best of Montreal and a great value given the quality of the food,  the super cool and unpretentious ambience and service. In this city of endless restaurants, many of which achieve international critical acclaim, the tasting menu here should be on your list for one of the best dining events to be had anywhere."}
{"text":"J'avais hâte de venir découvrir ce restaurant et nous avons profité du vendredi du week end de paques pour venir manger ici le midi.L'attente en valait la peine :)

Nous avons été réellement emballé par tout ce que propose ce restaurant.

Le cadre est épuré et accueillant. On se sent à l'aise dès que l'on arrive.

Le service est bon, RAS sur ce point là.

Concernant la cuisine nous avons réellement adoré. Les plats sont très bon et on ressent que le produit ainsi que la technique de cuisine sont au point. J'avais pour ma part pris un tartare de cerf (plat simple) et j'ai adoré. L'assaisonnement était très bon mais pour être parfait il aurait juste fallu un peu moins de mayo et que la viande soit coupé un peu moins fine pour avoir plus de mâche. Les frites maisons très bonne et ce qui m'a le plus ébloui est la salade. Oui, la salade du tartare ... elle était fabuleuse avec un assaisonnement et un assortiment de légumes racine (radis ... ). Je pense que c'est la meilleur salade verte d'accompagnement que j'ai mangé dans un restaurant tout simplement :) Cela a encore plus sublimé le plat !
Ma femme avait pris des raviolis avec du homard et des épinards. La sauce était juste folle, un régal et ce plat était aussi majestueux !
Concernant les desserts nous restons sur la même lignée, parfaits !

Pour le midi nous nous en sommes sortis à moins de 40$ par personne (taxe et tips inclus) pour un plat et un dessert avec café chacun.

En clair nous recommandons fortement ce restaurant et nous sommes sur de revenir car l'expérience culinaire était au RDV et cela à le mérite de devoir être précis."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal. I have eaten here like 5 times and everything is always perfect."}
{"text":"Wow! Pure awesomeness. There are nicer restaurants that you are glad you tried, then there are nice places like Bouillon Bilk that you can't wait to get back to.

Came here with a friend on a visit to Montreal. Everything I ate, drank, or just sampled off other plates was delicious.

The scallop plate was one of the best meals I have ever had, and definitely the best scallop plate.

The service was good, but just a bit slow.

The cocktails were spot on and the desserts (try the chocolate cake or jar of cookies) were delightful.

Reservations are probably required. They graciously accommodate English and French speakers. Note that the atmosphere is a bit dressy, but not fussy. Parking is on the street, so you might opt for a cab or bus.

You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal for sure. Each plate is carefully thought out and the combinations of tastes and textures are simply perfect and original. From the appetizer to the dessert, every plate amazes by its taste and perfect cooking/seasoning. Bouillon Bilk is where cooking meets art. Even though prices are expensive, you will pay less for the quality of the food than in other high priced restaurants around town."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing dinner experiences I have had. It was a table of 5 and none of us took pictures of our plates but they were indeed works of art. I know this post is short but if you are in the Montreal area, it is worth it to have dinner here.

The 5 of us all add appetizers and an entree, at least one glass of wine and no dessert and the bill came to about $500.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for the time and came to this place for our last dinner. I was so glad we came here because the food here is soooooo yummmy that makes the whole trip worth it. We had the tomato mussel and blue fin tuna for appetiZer. It was absolutely delicious. We had steak and scallop for entree. We literally clean the plate. This would be one of the reason that makes me wanna come bak to Montreal. :) love it!!!"}
{"text":"The lobster linguini was delicious!  Extremely flavorful, satisfying and light.  I wasn't too keen on the squash salad... presentation aside, the taste was quite strange - a slightly sweet curry salad."}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 for dinner on the Tuesday night and this place got pretty full while we were there!

The wine selection is immense and the wait staff was more than happy to help us choose good bottles for us to pair with our dishes. Speaking of service, they were courteous and on the ball.

I had their bone marrow appetizer (special of the day), hamachi appetizer, venison main, and yogurt cream for desert. TL;DR - my taste buds were doing backflips and kicking my eyes to roll back in delight. Damn. To choose an understatement: it was good.

Do yourself a favour: save up your pennies and go."}
{"text":"Although it can get a tad loud, the food is creative and delicious; the service is impeccable - attentive but unobtrusive. Great cocktails and wine list, too. Worth your time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. 

We came here for dinner with a large party for my bachelorette party, and they were super accommodating. We ordered basically 2 of everything from apps and entrees, a special of the night, and most desserts. 

Usually, when you have so many dishes, you have your favorites and your no thank you dishes. However, here, there wasn't a single dish I didn't like or was indifferent about. Everything was awesome, and it was just varying degrees of awesome. 

Apps, the standouts: 
-The linguine with sea urchin was so good that we ordered another round of it. -The lamb tartare was another favorite. 
-Hamachi was good, but people liked the special of the night the seam bream with fried shisito pepers even more. 

Entrees, the standouts: 
-Scallops - perfectly cooked. 
-Beef short ribs - rich and tender. 
 
Dessert, the stanouts: 
- strawberries and goat cheese - light and refreshing 
- pistachio cake - surprise of the night- tasty! 

Cocktails were tasty. Service was on point. Would come here again if I ever was back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food ---fantastic 
Recommend appetizer with lobster and duck for main courses. 
Very impressive restaurant in general~"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. I started with the New Orleans and negroni Blanc cocktails and both ere outstanding. Then we moved onto the starters of himachi and the beet salad were both perfectly blended in terms of contrasting flavours. T he scallops and the venison were both outstanding, it was hard to decide which was better. The pumpkin cake dessert was also a highlight. 

$230 for two people including tip!"}
{"text":"This place was very good. It has a very unassuming appearance and you may not even know you were looking at it from the outside.

We went there for a weekend birthday. You have to book much in advance if you would like to get a table at this place. It was a good experience and overall the food was good. 

The service was good and the staff was very pleasant.

Maybe its me, but I do think that the menu choices were slightly extravagant, but perhaps this a personal preference as I do prefer simpler foods.

I had the hamachi, grapefruit and cucumber as an appetizer. I really liked it alot. 

For the main course, I had the venison. This is served with cauliflower, chanterelles and labneh. Also very good. The deer was cooked to medium-rare. I don't remember having venison this rare... I enjoyed it.

For the dessert, I had the caramelized orange. This was excellent, and I would definitely recommend it. It is not part of the regular menu, and was one of the specials that day"}
{"text":"Let's see where to start. Just say probably the best choice that I made on this three days getaway trip. There is nothing around, but you can't miss it. Too many people and the restaurant itself just makes you want to give it a try. From the cocktail to the starters to the entrees and finished with the dessert. It just like a party in my mouth. I really enjoy everything. The service is one of the best service I had in awhile. If you are in Montreal, you need to try this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We went to Bouillon Bilk on a Friday night without a reservation (called and ask if they had space for us right before coming in--they were able to squeeze us in). Our hostess and waitress were very nice. Very modern setting. We started with the cheese plate (traditionally on their dessert menu). We chose the bleu, Alfred, and 14 Arpents. All excellent. The Moscovite cocktail was incredible, one of the best cocktails I've ever had. For dinner, we ordered the linguine dish and scallop dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The linguine and truffle sauce was out of this world and that is what I recommend to anyone trying Bouillon Bilk for the first time. They also served us very good bread during our dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Great tasting food. Beautiful presentation. World class service. Worth every penny. The Sweetbreads and tongue are fantastic. The hamachi appetizer was incredibly tasty. All our main courses were a great mix of flavours.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My lunch experience here was very close to perfection! When I walked in, the girl at the front wasn't smiling or very warm, other than that, it felt amazing! I sat at the bar, it was my first time dining alone, but it was fun! The bar tender was super friendly and polite. He explained the menu in English for me, made some recommendations for both food and wine and said Bon appetite to me for every single dish! 
I took his recommendation for hamachi as the starter, the Arctic chat as the main course and white wine from burgundy as my wine pairing. 
Oh boy, all of them were amazing! All the dishes were aesthetically pleasing, and they all had great creativity with a certain degree of twist. The hamachi was very fresh, but the chef used yogurt to add a sense of creaminess. 
The main course, Arctic char was cook to perfection! One side were so crispy and the fish was still tender and juicy! I asked for salt for some extra seasoning, and the black chick peas were definitely unexpected for this dish. But they complimented well with each other!
And the wine pairing! So awesome, it brought out an extra dimension to the dishes. It was perfect with seafood for sure, I was able to taste the crispness of the fish. I wasn't a big fan of wine before but now I don't think any meal is complete without wine!
No wonder this place is among the top restaurants in Montreal! Stunning!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Bouillon Bilk is a classy restaurant great for a date. Tasting menu is an excellent value for five to seven delicious dishes, especially shrimp linguini and steak and uni tartare.
VERDICT: I recommend.

The restaurant has a classy ambience that is good for a date without being a romantic spot. When I went with two other friends, there were couples, businessmen and women, and friend groups. I recommend making a reservation to ensure a table at the desired time.

They have a la carte items, but if it is your first time at Bouillon Bilk, I recommend the tasting menu. They had a five and eight course menu. The five was sufficient to satiate my hunger and taste buds. The highlights were the steak and uni tartare, shrimp linguini. I liked the quail and foie gras; however, the foie gras was especially smooth and left something to be desired with regards to texture. It may be wise to save some bread to eat with the foie gras. Still, it was super tasty and cleaned my plate. The dessert was interesting. The ice cream and hazelnut flavours were rather refreshing without feeling heavy and decadent. I also really liked the crunch that was added to the dessert dish.

The staff and servers are very friendly. No complaints there with five stars all around. Bouillon Bilk has top notch food without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I am not sophisticated enough language-wise to talk about this gastronomique restaurant, but I will do my best. We went there with my girlfriend and a good friend of ours. We had entrée, plat, dessert and a couple of bottles of average wine (from around 2005-2006, 40-50 each) and the bill was around 350$. Totally worth it. The food was original (well, gastronomique), and the waiter was very fun, charming and in very good mood. We discussed quite a lot with him, since he was an artist returning to Europe...

I am rather picky on what I eat, and I have been living in France for long enough to get even pickier, but despite my reticence to ingest anything unfamiliar, my adventurous side couldn't resist what the chef was serving. We had lobster, some fried lamb brain and duck confit (with a secret sauce) as main dish. All were excellent and I even tried the lamb brain, although I could not stand looking at it, and it was delicious - a tad bit sweet, a tad bit greasy, but just striking the balance. All herbs used in the food were fresh and coming from the private garden of the restaurant. 

Despite the sober looks of the restaurant, the atmosphere is very happy and lively, as opposed to relaxing. Every now and then a loud and pitch female laughter rings in your ear, and the walls are not soundproof, which makes the sound reverberate even more. You can hear all the cutlery at work around you... This is not a downside for me, as I see it as a part of the concept, but I'm just warning those who are searching for a cozy and relaxing experience that this is probably not the place they are searching for. 

I also do not recommend the restaurant to the non-adventurous searching for normal food and reasonable environment. Absolutely not recommended for a first date either, as the food can be too weird and the menu too limited. Principally you have to eat what the chef serves at that moment (the menu changes regularly). Great place for foodie experience, though..."}
{"text":"Food: 4 and half star
Service: 2 and half star except the wine expert girl who has wonderful personality.
Environment: table is far too small for very large plates.And no space between the tables for comfort . No privacy at all."}
{"text":"Made the reservation a few months ago for our trip to Montreal.
We showed up and our table was waiting. We didn't really look at the menu as our goal was the tasting menu. We got the 5 course with the wine paring. Fish, meat, lamb, linguine with shrimp and a dessert. The plates were beautiful and portions were just right. The flavors were subtle enough that they all worked well together. 2.5 hours was excellent managed for the meal and service was excellent. Wines paired perfect as well. The noise level was constant and I would have liked it a little less but it wasn't too detracting. The tables are a little cramped and when the table next to us needed service, the waiters were a close to us with their backs. But that's the only negative. Aside from that it was great."}
{"text":"Best dining experience of my life! The flavors are original, strong and fresh! Quality service, so kind and helpful, smooth ambiance, just perfect."}

C'était vraiment merveilleux, j'en reste bouche bée! J'ai mangé comme jamais, bu du vin de qualité et passé une soirée incroyable ! Il y a un menu dégustation pour 85$ et 8 services et qu'on peut aussi amalgamer avec des vins durant tous les services ! C'est certain, après avoir goûter aux plats, que la prochaine fois, on essaie ce menu!! Bref, je vous suggère le cerf en entrée et ABSOLUMENT les pétoncles en repas principal! Ce sera une jouissance pour vos papillles gustatives ! J'en reviens pas encore ! Ce restau méritr amplement sa réputation, je suis vendue!"}
{"text":"Oh Bouillon Bilk, I have walked by you a thousand times and never tried you until recently. Why was I such a fool. I guess better late than never?

We went for a late Friday afternoon lunch and the place was packed with people, mostly office/government workers that work nearby.  Luck was on our side when we walked in as that they had an empty table for the three of us! Would definitely make reservations though. Atmosphere is great and the vibe is very, very relaxed.

To start, we tried the:
- Daily soup ($5) - cream broccoli with goat cheese and grapes. My grandma wanted more but it was great. Not too creamy and a couple bites of goat cheese and grapes was a nice touch.
- Daily salad ($5) - mixed greens with coleslaw. A very simple salad but had a nice depth of flavour to it. Very fresh and summery.

For entrees, we each ordered and shared:
- Gnocchi  ($16) - came with shrimp, squash and sage. This is what I ordered and it was my favourite of the three. Sauce was so good and the gnoccchi was light, not heavy, you know?
- Veal flank steak ($17)  - came with chorizo, clams and coriander. I tried a bit and the chorizo had a bit of heat to it.
 - Red sea bass ($17) - came with spetzel, ratatouille and brussel sprouts. Fish was tender. Really liked the spetzel which you don't see very often.

All the dishes were flawless and presentation was just amazing. Everything we ordered was tasty and we were all impressed. Great food, great service (our waiter explained in detail the whole menu to us) and a great place. You have to try Bouillon Bilk if you haven't been yet, it's worth it."}
{"text":"A small classy restaurant. It kept showing up on our Yelp searches so thought we'd give er' a shot. Pricey smaller portions, but nicely plated. The exterior was quiet and enjoyable. 
I had the beef which was a short rib, while my wife enjoyed their scallops dish. 

We followed it with their strawberries and white chocolate Chantilly dessert. 

Service was quick. Only qualm was they didn't follow up to see if we enjoyed our meal until we were nearly done."}
{"text":"Oh wow - this place was neat.

Seriously, this was one if not the best meals I have ever had. This was the last meal that my boyfriend and I had while on a trip to Montreal and I am SO happy we did it.

We started off with some cocktails. I went with the negroni blanc which was extremely refreshing. They also have a wide selection of wine and our waitress was very helpful in deciding. Maybe it's just because I am used to New York City prices, but I thought that the alcohol was quite reasonable (even with out the USD:CAD conversion ;) ).

We opted to get a tortellini and duck dish to start which was delightful. It was a little small for two people, but we certainly wanted to save room for the main course so it was okay. For the main course, we got the venison and the scallops. I am so torn on which one was better. I did enjoy the scallops because they utilized a lot of different sauces and textures which really added pizzazz to the fish, but the venison was cooked absolutely perfectly. You really can't go wrong with either. 

Now, the absolute BEST part of my meal was the pumpkin cake dessert. It featured a variety of nuts, cream, carrot shavings, and was topped with a little dollop of ginger ice cream. Given the complexity of the dish and components, every bite that you had was completely different than the last and legitimately made my mouth the happiest place on earth. If it had not been out last night, I would have made my boyfriend go back just to get that wonderful dish one last time.

Seriously this place is amazing - I can't recommend it more. The chef clearly puts a lot of effort into building the flavors of each dish, and the result is something you have never had and probably will never have again."}
{"text":"Had a great meal in Montreal while out there on a business trip.

Terrific food, drink, and service. 

If I'm back in Montreal, I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"A true fine dining experience. My girlfriend and I made a dinner reservation for Sunday night with hopes of experiencing authentic French cuisine while visiting Montreal. The atmosphere was very modern, with a very romantic feel to it. I found myself lost looking at a menu in French, but thankfully I was accommodated with an English version. I have not explored French cuisine prior to this, but I must say that it was outstanding. The meal was expensive, but worth it in my opinion. Best scallops I've ever had. We visited around Christmas time, and the surrounding area had tons of lights on display throughout the streets which was nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome really! The food was excellent and so were the service and the staff. Not too many choices, but every single one of them is very original and tasteful. You get to experience tastes and products that you cannot find everywhere.
Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"What an unbelievable dining experience! The restaurant is located in a somewhat seedy part of the city, in a non-descript building, but once you start eating, you will think you've gone to heaven! The service is top-notch, the waiters know their stuff and speak English very fluently. They even have English menus. We had the scallops, the tagglietelli, the cheese plate, the veal, the oysters and a chocolate desert. Everything was to die for! It's one of the best meals you will have in your life, so run and eat here! It will cost you $$$$, but it's worth every penny. You better make a reservation as it gets very busy, and for good reason."}
{"text":"So I walk up to the restaurant which is on a very unassuming street. Saw a sign for an electronics store and thought I got to the wrong place at first. What a pleasant surprise! 

The interior of the restaurant is modern and minimalist. Not very large and very busy. 

We started with the uni linguine. It was creamy and the uni was fresh and brought nice flavor. It's a small portion, but because it is very rich, it was the right amount. For the main, we had a prime rib special. Boy, was that a treat! Large 1 kg of meat that was perfectly cooked and presented with the bone in. Feast for the eyes and the stomach.  There were a couple parts that were a little raw but the waiter took it right back and cooked those slightly more. Came back out great. The prime rib also came with 3 sides, all of which were delicious. Mushrooms were simply prepared but were my favorite. There was also a cauliflower and mini carrots. Potato salad with bacon bits was very nice as well. There was so much food that I think this dish is best shared by 3-4 if you want to order appetizers and desserts. 

The service was excellent. I was given great wine recommendations that paired well. 

Overall, a great experience. Helpful service, beautifully presented tasty food, cozy and modern setting. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal. The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it. Street parking only. The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance. We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595. Staff and service are both friendly. There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area. I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation. Eating early definitely has its benefits. We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening. 

For appetizers, we ordered:

Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's \"raw\". Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish. 

Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch. Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent.

Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it. Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender. The sour cream added a slight hint of \"cheesy\" tang that I didn't care for.

Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing. The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish. The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness.

For our entrees, we ordered: 

Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish. The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it. Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.  The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish. The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked. This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped. 

Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail. The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich. All of the elements were superb. 

Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut). The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare. For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child. For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with. 

I definitely recommend this restaurant. Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling. If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful place with inventive fusion style menu and attentive, knowledgable, proficient staff.

Atmosphere - 5
Food- 4.5
Prices - 5
Location - 4.5

I had enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu at $75 which initially I was hesitant to order.  However, I can definitely say I was not disappointed in the choice.

There is option of 5 or 8 courses but when travelling, must try it all!   If you are an average eater, the menu is just slightly under so it may or may not fill you up; order the appetizers and entrees instead. The style is also quite creative combining interesting ingredients but well balanced.  If white chocolate and sour cream sauce is something that tickles your fancy, definitely visit this place."}
{"text":"The Montreal food scene is well talked about, with the added advantage of it being one of Anthony Bourdain's favourite places to visit because of its decadent food culture. My trip to Montreal, was a little less Bourdain-ish if you will- given that my trip was not consumed by the quest for a dish of foie gras, stuffed inside a red, bleeding hunk of meat, topped with another type of foie gras (you get the drift..). I was looking, however, to go for one very good meal, as a belated birthday dinner for my companion and boyfriend, Ben! After  much deliberation, I settled on Bouillon Bilk. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance, just to be safe. 

The atmosphere at Bouillon is somewhere in between casual and fine dining. It certainly doesn't give off the 25$ per person brunch restaurant vibe and  it certainly isn't the kind of place you'd never to think to go if you didn't have a jacket on. It makes for easy digestion, which can sometimes (in the very snotty restaurants) be hampered by the constant feeling of being stared at by your faithful server. Do not mistake this for sloppiness- the waiters are well dressed, attentive and well spoken (even if ours was rather stern at the start, she softened up later). 

Now for the food. My starter involved very soft, fresh crab meat, that was given character with the addition of sweet peas and an interesting almond crumble. Together, the three made for a good flavor combination on the palette- slightly bland but very good. Ben's starter was particularly unusual and excellent: linguini with uni (sea urchin). The portion was just right, not too much, but enough to fill a few fork-twirls with linguini, which was lathered with a sauce that had hints of fennel (pollen), citrus and chilli. Competing for 1st place with the sauce were the 4 pieces of uni on the top, succulent and sweet. Moving on to the main course, Ben's dish was scallops with Shitake mushroom, pea leaves and courgette done 2, perhaps 3 ways and also pear. The scallops were fresh, and the tender texture of the scallops and the Shitake mushrooms was balanced with the sweetness of the pear and the courgette. A very satisfactory and rather filling entrée. Mine was a ricotta ravioli with rabbit- the ravioli was topped with tender, tiny slivers of rabbit meat, morel mushrooms and a smattering of spiral green vegetables (that reminded me of the stickiness of okra but had a nice crunch to them). All of this in a light sauce and topped with crushed pistachios. Very good. And finally, dessert. I must mention that I almost never choose anything with chocolate for dessert, but I did this time and I wasn't sorry. We shared a chocolate Crème Prise with ricotta icecream. Three dollops of delightfully rich chocolatey goodness- a texture somewhere between mousse and ganache. This was accompanied by ricotta icecream and topped with cherries, cashews, coffee cream and a rich and bold coffee crumble. The cherries and the coffee had strong flavours which cut through the richness of the chocolate, while the icecream gave relief between each bite of chocolate, cleansing the palette for the next. 

We finished with tea (we also did have a glass of wine each, one of which was sub-par, but that can be easily forgiven and might also just be a matter of personal taste). The meal was, all things considered, excellent. I'd go back when next in Montreal and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"From the beginning until the end of the \"Menu dégustation\", it was nothing but delight. The originality in the choice of ingredients, the diversity of flavours brought us, and will probably bring you, closer to heaven. 
Among all the dishes on that menu,we particularly liked the way they prepared \"hamachi\" or Pacific yellowtail. Until I learned how to make it, I would have to go back there just for that dish. LOL
Either for this dish or others, we had great pleasure at recognizing or discovering the ingredients the Chef had carefully chosen. Some are so rarely used in most kitchens that we had to ask our waiter where to find them. 
Finally, make sure to save some space for their fabulous dessert."}
{"text":"Service is great!
Oysters is very good, the scallops are nice, juicy but kind of sandy. 
I won't order the shrimp linguine again, the texture is just like instant noodle, and the shrimps are tiny!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of Montréal ' s best restaurant!

I really like how there is so much flavor and delicate each plate is. 

The plates are pretty small so if you order only an appetizer, a main dish, and a dessert;  you will mostly still feel hungry afterward.

We were 2 people and ordered:
2 amuse bouches
3 appetizers 
3 main dishes

Although the plates were smalls ans I thought a some point that I will still feel hungry after my meal, they space the service of each plate very well. Hence, we were pretty full after the 2nd main dish. We struggled to finish our last main dish...which was actually my less favorite of the whole night (venison was kinda tough...I had better elsewhere). 

As my friend said during our dinner there, the sauce used is well balanced and compliments the main ingredient very well. We particularly loved the scallops and poached salmon dish.

Please reserved ahead of time if you want to eat there on a specific day and time (we reserved a week ahead and could only get a table at 9:30pm).

Expect to pay over $100/person if you are going to consume alcohol."}
{"text":"Divine dining experience. 

Food - I recommend the tasting menu so you can experience all this place has to offer. Or you can do a first course (left side of menu) and main course (right side of menu). The full tasting menu (8 courses $90 cad) was amazing, specifically due to the thoughtfulness of the textures in each dish. My favorites were the clam, the hamachi, and the truffle linguini. 

Drinks - if you order the tasting menu, you can pair wines with each course ($75 cad for full menu). I tried several cocktails but my favorite was the house take on a moscow mule. They used fresh ginger and that really kicked it up a notch. 

Service - All staff are well knowledgeable and lovely. While some spoke only a little English, they were so nice and seemed to enjoy practicing their presentation skills in English. We had Gabriel as our main server and he was wonderful."}
{"text":"Une table délicieuse tout en gardant sa simplicité. Belle sélection de vins. Service sympathique. Recommandé!!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice so far and both times took the tasting menu and haven't been disappointed yet. The food is innovative and delicious and the atmosphere is chic but not pretentious. They were very accommodating to my infant and our big hulking stroller too which I appreciate a lot from a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"There is a reason Buillon Bilk was named one of the restaurants to try in Montreal before you die. This place is fabulous. At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain. You wouldn't expect this place to have it all. But I came here not for the decor. I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials. Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors. Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough. 
I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something. I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini. Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be. I'm at a lost for words. I could die happy. Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk."}
{"text":"We dined at Bouillon Bilk on our second night in Montreal. It was good but not great in my opinion. Maybe I expected more from all of the stellar reviews? I'm not sure. 

We both started with the amuse bouche, which was sea urchin the evening we were there. It was pretty good. My husband wasn't a fan, but that's likely because he wasn't super familiar with sea urchin to begin with. I had the steak special for dinner, I can't remember what my husband had. The food overall, aside from the amuse, was rather unmemorable. I had to look back through pictures to remember what I had. Comparing that to other meals we had while in Montreal, which I am still remembering fondly, is enough of an indication that we aren't really interested in returning. 

The service was okay. Our waitress was kind of spacey. They accidentally misdelivered a dessert to our table with birthday candles on it (it was neither of our birthdays). Someone, who I assumed was the Maitre D, came over didn't introduce himself and made a weird comment about our choice of dessert (strawberry something) was good even though the weather in October calls for something richer (wtf?). I thought he was going to apologize for having the wrong dessert sent to our table, buuut I guess not? Seating was cramped in an irritating, not cozy or intimate, way. 

Again, overall it was fine, but unmemorable. For the price there are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal we'd return to first."}
{"text":"Pure delish!! First of all I tend to judge a restaurant by the bread that they serve (amongst other things too but bread for the most part) and this place, hands down, serves the best sourdough ever. The service was amazing and the atmosphere was great. It's not a big place so you feel nice and cozy. The appetizers were perfect and the dinner was superb. I had the hen and my husband had the venison. The portions look small when they come out but believe me, you will leave very stuffed. This is a little gem in Montreal and I highly recommend.
LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Limited menu but extremely good. Recommend the scallop or the duck dishes. Definitely one of the best restaurants in Montreal. Very ambient setting, great for fancy date night."}
{"text":"Quite literally the best restaurant meal I have ever had. Which may not be saying much because of my unsophisticated palate, but I imagine that means a real foodie would appreciate this place even more than I did."}
{"text":"Quality food served with style, this is my short summary about the Bouillon Bilk experience. All the plates I managed to dig in were delicious. For everybody who will bother to read this review, the menu of the restaurant changes periodically and my descriptions below may not be valid in few months. 

The best of the appetizers:
The risotto with white truffles was amazing, you won't find it on the menu and the portion won't fill you up, but the ingredients are perfect;
Linguini with rabbit and snails, perfectly balanced, filling dish;
The amuse bouche is not optional, you must have the bone marrow.  

Mains were even better:
I would definitely come back for my venison, it was perfectly medium rare cooked, surrounded by rich combination of side flavours; 
The cappelleti with parsnip, lobster and chestnut is absolutely the best alternative as a  main course for seafood lovers;
Are you scallops addict, don't hesitate, the chef knows how to prepare them. 

The desserts are delicious and presented with imagination: parsnip ice-cream was my little discovery for the night. 

The wine list is long, rather then reading and pretending that we know what to choose we followed the sommelier's advice. He brought us three bottles that should match our predominately seafood choices and the two of them we picked were wonderful. 

Beware the restaurant will charge a deposit for big group of people, they accept reservations up to ten and the deposit will be reimbursed back to your credit card once you are at the restaurant. 

Fantastic restaurant for our first group dinner in 2015!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch at Bouillon Bilk recently. Hamachi tartare was incredibly well seasoned without losing the freshness and character of the fish. Guinea fowl roulade was also a perfect balance of sweet and savory (though the tartness of the cranberries could have been more assertive). Service was attentive. Would love to return for dinner some day."}
{"text":"Awesome experience, start to finish.  In the top 5 meals I've ever had.  We did the 8-course tasting menu without pairings and almost each course knocked it out of the park.  We weren't in love with one of the desserts, which had a beet sorbet/custard inside.  Nothing really wrong with it, just wasn't our taste in a dessert.  We wouldn't have even mentioned to the staff, but they noticed and sent over chocolates gratis - in addition to apologizing profusely.  Again, we wouldn't have even commented, not expecting to love all 8 courses of a tasting menu, so I was extremely impressed by this touch.  They genuinely seemed extremely interested in how we were enjoying the courses and asked for feedback at the end of the meal.  If I had to pick highlights, I'd say the lobster and cannelloni, but even picking those two is difficult as they were all wonderful.  

Service was perfect - not intrusive but not cold either, always friendly and smiling without going overboard.  The cadence of the meal was perfect.

The atmosphere inside isn't super warm or romantic, which would be the only con I could find if I really had to - but that's not what they're going for.  It's a more mod/stark interior, and it works.  It was expensive but that was to be expected and to me, the experience was worth the cost.

I highly, highly recommend this restaurant and would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Mardi midi, il ne reste que le bar pour les gens qui comme moi, n'ont pas cru bon de réserver.   C'est un moindre mal, car je vivrai la même expérience culinaire qu'eux.
Je débute par le ceviche de pétoncles qui est tout a fait phénoménal.... Parfait amalgame de saveurs et juste assez parfumé pour qu'on puisse quand même distinguer le goût délicat du pétoncle... Wow.. Dommage que l'assiette n'en comporte pas plus..;-)
Je suis un peu déçu quand je vois arriver mon plat de saumon bio car les pétoncles m'ont solidement ouvert l'appétit et j'ai vraiment faim.  La pièce de saumon semble petite mais elle se révèlera finalement plus grosse que je le croyais.  De plus, les gnocchis qui l'accompagnent forment un parfait ensemble qui fait que je suis parfaitement rassasié lorsque je termine mon assiette.
Le service est sans faille et on a l'impression que le serveur ne s'occupe que de nous alors qu'on voit très bien que le resto est bonde.
La patronne semble de plus le chef d'orchestre qui dirige les troupes d'une main de maître.
Bravo... On y retourne encore, encore... Et encore...."}
{"text":"*Best meal I have had so far
*The restaurant itself was rather elusive. There was a lot of empty and sketchy store fronts in the area, and the restaurant's sign was no where to be found either. 
*The restaurant was gorgeous! The front windows let in lots of natural lights. The restaurant had a refined minimalist decor with a warm buzz of activity. 
*Reservation is recommended. 
*Bouillon Bilk's menu isn't very extensive - around 5 to 6 dishes for starters and mains. 
*All the ingredients are sourced locally and the menu changes according to what's available each season, thus some of the dishes I had for the night might no longer be available.
*loved how the restaurant gave off a high-end vibe, yet service was incredibly friendly and well - you don't need to dress up at all. 

-Fluke Tartare - $20
 On the initial bites, I found that the fluke was quite salty on its own, however the fresh slices of apples really helped to tone down the saltiness of the fish. The truffle added just a right amount of earthiness to the dish without losing the freshness and character of the fish.

-Scallops - $31
the scallop was glistening when cut open! Loved the fresh pear that brought out the sweetness of the scallop. The brown butter sauce had a nutty aroma and richness which really brought the entire dish together. The only complain I would have was the portion of the scallop. Though there were several pieces on the plate, they were quite small for a main dish at a $31 price tag.

-Venison - $34
The venison was tender and had a perfect medium rare temperature all the way through. The meat didn't have a gamey taste and it just melted-in-your-mouth-goodness. The rosti underneath was crispy on the outside, soft and meltingly, well, potato-ey within, it was so good!  I believe the sauce contained both juniper and honeyberries, which provided a sweet, peppery taste that stands up perfectly to the robust flavors of wild game."}
{"text":"I heard about Bouillon Bilk a while back on Guide Resto-Voir. Finally got around to grabbin' me some tasty grub. An eatery this is not. This is a tiny little resto, maybe even a bit cramp, but it serves some very, very fine dining. 

First let's talk service. The service here is sublime. The server will go through EVERY item on the menu with you and to top it off he or she has some sommelier skills and can offer you the correct wine to pair with your meal. This is something that's not often seen in today's \"casual fine dining\" scene, so appreciated, even from me who doesn't drink wine. What I do drink is Whisky. And when I asked about what malts they had, he veered me towards a delicious bourbon drink which blew my mind with its sweetness. The server really knew his way around the spirits and the food and offered us great, above-par, service. Enough so that I felt guilty on my way home, leaving the guy only 20% for tip. He deserved 25% easily, and more. Let's not forget that the very elegant owner who took the time from her very busy restaurant to discuss with us and get our feedback which was pretty much as follows:

GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD-DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN THAT WAS AWESOME!

Pardon my French.

First of all, let's talk risotto... yeah. Kind of a pet peeve of mine. Firstly is risotto, not risotto - can't stand the common mispronunciation, just wanted to get that one out of the way.I've had some great risotto, I've had some average risotto,  and I've had some horrible risotto (I'm looking at you Liverpool House and your choke-on-your-food-its-so-dry-rabbit served on the most horrible risotto I've ever had - made more disappointing that it was prepared by a world renowned chef and the golden child of Montreal cuisine - that looked and tasted like Uncle Ben's 5 minute instant rice and was dryer that a nervous virgin on prom night, pardon my French again) but I digress. 

We're here to talk about Bouillon Bilk and their risotto. Their risotto is the absolute best I've had so far in my life and there's a twist. It was prepared not with chicken stock but carrot juice. I know what you're thinking, carrot juice, can they do that? Yes and the execution was mindblowingly delicious. A masterful production of flavour; it was served with sunflower seeds, curly slivers of rice vinegar marinated carrots and clementine supremes topped with a tiny dollop of crème fraiche, which if you're smart you keep for the end. Let me explain to you the best I can, how brilliant this dish was... I had to sit back in my chair and hold back some tears... yes, yes, tears. I haven't eaten something this delicious since I ate the cromesqui at Au Pied de Cochon a few years back. The only bad part about this risotto is that I couldn't eat a bucket-full of it. 

This brilliant starter was followed by an equally brilliant. Guinea hen with foie gras, polenta, porcini, figs, and walnuts. The guinea hen brings another level of flavour that the versatile chicken lacks, although I think I missed out on the duck my friend partook of, but seriously there's was nothing wrong with this plate. I don't know how they prepared those figs, but they were like crack, the porcini; heavenly. The foie gras, was foie gras... meaning awesome.  Even the polenta, something which I don't dislike but don't particularly care for, was better than what I've had in the past and had a very smooth texture to it. The plate looked light on food, but don't let that fool you, there was plenty. All the flavours perfectly connected with each other and had distinct \"terroire\" brilliance that I find, again, rare these days. (For a terroire-gasm, I invite you to seek out La Vieille Histoire in Ste-Rose, Laval; how they prepare boar, is sublime)

Top this all off with a very playful desert; a mason jar of piping-hot fresh chocolate chip cookies. But to keep with the playful motif, I think it should have been served with a glass of milk with \"mousse-y\" head. I mean, if you're gonna make me nostalgic for my childhood, go all the way. But they were amazing, hot, melting chocolate-chip goodness, the kind of chocolate chip cookies you dream of but can never obtain. It's like chasing the chocolate-chip cookie dragon and actually catching it. Mission Accomplished.

In the end, a sublime meal with great food, perfect service in a very nice dining room (though a bit loud) a hop and a skip away from Le Quartier des Spectacles and the St-Laurent Metro. It's on a block you wouldn't expect to find a fine dining restaurant, but there it is... now everyone... GO... NOW.... RIGHT NOW.... you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite restaurants ever in terms of atmosphere and food. 

I came here on a friend's recommendation, alone, for my birthday. (I was traveling for work!) I had a reservation and sat at the spacious bar in the middle of the restaurant. They have both an a la carte menu and a set menu, and I opted for the set, since the price is quite a steal comparing to fancy establishments near SF where I usually hang out.

The whole tasting was just amazingly fresh and delicious. The menu didn't particularly lean towards a cuisine - there was Cantonese influence in a dish, French in another, and Japanese in yet another. I can still taste the umami of the seafood - they definitely did those spectacularly - but the meats and vegetables were delicious as well. The presentation was also beautifully arranged.

They do serve some interesting stuff like rabbit or squab, so if you are not a fan of game you might want to go a la carte. Although, their game is really well done and not gamey at all!

I didn't order the wine pairing but had them recommend 2 different glasses to go with the whole meal. It worked out really well, and I got to try some old world wines which are harder to get to on the west coast. 

If you are in Montréal, go visit this place now! You definitely will have a wonderful time there."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, thoughtful and elegant approach to cuisine. You would think a place like this would be snobbish, but it manages to maintain a casual laid back atmosphere. We started with a variety of oysters and cocktails. For mains we ordered the shallots and rabbit ravioli. Both were amazing. Desert could not have been better."}
{"text":"We loved Bouillon Bilk! 

The food is absolutely delicious - especially the savory dishes. We had the foie gras and the truffle pasta as starters, the beef and the rooster afterwards - everything was awesome, very well plated, and quite plentiful. 

Service is super nice and attentive without being too strict or uptight. They brought a candle for my boyfriend's birthday, and were absolutely charming all night. 

I recommend going to Bouillon Bilk for any occasion - or even without an occasion, since it is on the affordable side of expensive (starters $15-25, mains $30-35, desserts $11 - all without tips and taxes)."}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this restaurant has a 4 1/2 star rating with hundreds of reviews.  

I could tell upon entering that I would fall in love, and I did.  The space is light, breezy and spacious, but without feeling cavernous or overwhelming.  The staff members are incredibly friendly, and didn't seem to mind one bit that my friend was 15 minutes late.

And our meal here on May 28 was nothing short of spectacular, from start to finish.  The start: two incredible negronis which were painstakingly prepared in front of us (we were at the bar), and which included strips of orange peel with carved edges in different geometric patterns.  Beautiful.  (My friend had another at the end of the meal, and the orange peel was carved in yet another pattern.)  I also had an exquisite gin martini, with St. Laurent dry gin, a spirit new to me but destined to become a favorite.  It has an improbable set of botanicals, including local hand-harvested seaweed.  This is a love-it or hate-it gin.  I loved it.  Wine selections were amazing too, with the largest and most extensive assortment of by-the-glass selections I saw during my whole trip to this great city.  

The food was spectacular.  We should have ordered the tasting menu (next time, it will be a must), but were worried about the amount of food.  Instead, we ended up ordering two small plates (trout, oyster, beet, lingonberries, nori; and foie gras, mackerel, orange, radicchio, crosnes), two large plates (rabbit, pistachios, potato, ras el-hanout, spinach, leek; and cappelletti, rutabaga, foie gras, sweetbreads, pecans, maple), and then again another two small plates (oyster mushrooms, feta, apple, sunflower, poblano, kohlrabi; and crab, beef, rhubarb, lime, cilantro, celery).  Dessert: chocolate, hazelnuts, parsnip, banana; and three cheeses.  

The plates were works of art, and the food equally inspired.  Flavor combinations were unique, vibrant, complementary yet individual, and playful.  The taste profiles extraordinarily well balanced, and the courses as a whole were beyond delicious.

The service was incredibly friendly, and even though the place was jam packed (from 6-8 pm on a Monday!) and the bartenders/servers incredibly busy, they were all smiles with us and chatted frequently throughout our meal.

There are so many great restaurants in Montreal that I want to visit (and will, on future trips), but this will be a spot I will return to on every subsequent visit."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est très bien, un unique plat à 30$ qui est bien et goûteux, la suiteuse est super efficace et professionnelle, par contre le serveur est pompeux et fait une face si tu ne prend pas le menu découverte. J'ai aimé l'expérience mais une chose qui est inacceptable c'est que PERSONNE ne vient te voir une fois ton repas servit. Ce qui est étrange car il y a beaucoup de personnel. Une chance que la cuisson était à point !"}
{"text":"Fairly easy to get reservations to, although it was for 8pm. Which may be a bit late for montreal.. 

The food is really good here. Everything is decomposed and reinvented. Had the scallops which were great. The brown butter sauce was amazing. Only knock on the dish is that the scallops were pretty tiny. I would expect bigger scallops for $30+ plate. 

The seabass was pretty good as well and the venison was very tender. 

The quebec cheese was great too. 5 cheese for $20 is a steal of a deal. And the desserts were great too. Got the rice pudding and it was delicious. 

Would definitely reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Toujours aussi bon. au top !"}
{"text":"This was one of the most memorable dinners I have had in a while. Phenomenal food and service. The restaurant itself is very modern and hip. When compared to the rest of Quebec, the food is very light and refreshing. 

We started off with the hamachi and the white truffle risotto. The hamachi was beautifully presented with incredibly fresh yellowtail. The white truffle risotto was to die for. If this was the last dish of my life, I would die very happy. There was a plentiful amount of white truffles along with crispy leaves of Brussel sprouts. It was so good, we ordered a second order for desert. For our entrees, we ordered lobster cappelletti and scallops. Both really good dishes with perfectly cooked scallops. 

The let down was desert when compared to the rest of the ordered food: chocolate mousse brioche with shaving of (frozen?) foie gras. Overthought and salty. I would skip this one. 

The sommelier here is super knowledgable and will surely pair your choices with the perfect wine. On my next visit to Montreal, I will surely be coming back to this gem. Delicious and fairly priced for such a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"I like this casual fine dining. Their menu is pretty simple too. Just choose an appetizer, a main and a dessert. And they have a great beer selection too.

My favorite was actually the dessert. The rice pudding was awesome. I would come back and just hang out in the bar just for the rice pudding. But the veal and sweetbreads was also noteworthy.

Ambiance was great too. Again, casual, but seemed pretty intimate too. And fine dining without the pretentious service."}
{"text":"8 of us came here for dinner. 7pm reservation. the tables were well prepared ahead of time.
2 people were late, but they were very accommodating.
We all got the 6-course meal.
The food is seasonable so it changes.
The food was fantastic!! (although very small portions)
I had to get bar food afterwards.
The server was very attentive and knowledgable.
However, it took about 3 hours to serve a 6 course meal, which is insanely slow. 
Would recommend for people who don't have plans for rest of the night, but not recommended for a 1st or 2nd date."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We tried the tasting menu, which was 70 bucks per head. It's around 6 courses, with a dessert as the last course. Portions for each are tiny, but they add up, so believe me, you will be full! The first and last course was my favorite - the dessert especially was sensational. Of course, how could one go wrong with French desserts :)


Seats fill up quickly, so book a reservation early for this place."}
{"text":"Very impressed by the food here. This chef is really doing a great job in Montreal culinary scene. Presentation,  combinations, ambiance, well everything. Love the outside building facades, blends well with the other stores next to it.

Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Bouillon Bilk was highly recommended by one of my coworkers when he heard I was going to Montreal, so I knew I had to try it out. I easily secured a 9PM table on a Friday night. Unlike in NYC, restaurants in Montreal have your table ready as soon as you walk in the door (probably because they offer fewer seatings per night). The space itself was dimly lit and very modern/upscale - would be perfect for a date or special occasion, though I saw many large groups of friends here as well.

We ordered the 5-course tasting menu for $70 CAD (8-course also available for $90 CAD), and thought it was a steal for the caliber and quantity of food. Everything was delicious. Only nit I'd have was that the pasta in the shrimp linguine seemed slightly overcooked and gummy, though that didn't detract from how good the rest of the dish was. 

Cocktails were well mixed, and my friend also had a wine that she loved.

In a city of great food, Bouillon Bilk still stands out. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The meal my wife and I enjoyed here was one of the best we have enjoyed anywhere. Absolutely outstanding. Nice environment, good service and a truly outstanding meal."}
{"text":"This was on my to-try list, finally took my parents there for Father's Day.

The place is modernly decorated. Classy. The staff is very courteous, helpful and attentive.

The food was great. We tried out the amuse-bouche, the foie gras, beef & lobster and black bass. Everything was very well seasoned, all the tastes worked together harmoniously. When I mentioned I don't eat gluten, they actually came out with rice crackers which was nice. The bread was apparently very good. The dessert was also very interesting: parsnip ice creaam with roasted bananas and chocolate!!!!

I like the portions, I was actually slightly more full than I thought I would be but keep in mind that this is not a bistro type place with hearty servings. 

I definitely recommend this place and would come back :)"}
{"text":"Best four meals we ever had in our lives! This place is out of this world! Nuff said! 

The issue that I now face is that I am comparing all my current dining experiences with Bilk and I am always disappointed. The food just does not compare!

So if you really don't want to enjoy another meal in your life because let me tell you, nothing will taste as delicious as food at this establishment, them I dare you to eat here! Just remember, that I warned you!"}
{"text":"FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.  

First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at. The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated. Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you. That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening. You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service.

In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door. In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time... Just gorgeous!). 

For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu. The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table. 

Now, onto the foooooood: 

Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan. The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal. 

Beef duo - Special of the night. Grilled strip loin (\"Melt-in-your-mouth\") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well).

Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible. The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying. Big chunks of lobster on top. Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side... I was literally tasting perfection. 

Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream. I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point. I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache. 

To explain my four-star rating... We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes. Even after having three full courses, we were not that full. Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!"}
{"text":"We were here for lunch to celebrate my friend's birthday. I had already heard good things about the restaurant from my friend. And it came accross all my expectations. A very attentive and informed server, a good clean table and awesome food - what else could you ask for. It is an expensive restaurant, but worth going out for a good experiencd. I would recommend you to make a reservation in advance as it is full during lunch/dinner hours. Also, do order the starters. The portions of the starters and main vourse are small and you would have space to eat dessert even after eating both :)
The desserts are delicious too... I ended up trying each ine as we ordered one of each kind on the table!
I would definitely visit this place more often if I could afford it ;)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat in Montreal.  I tend to be a fast eater but the food here is so amazing and so thoughtfully conceived that it MAKES you slow down to enjoy it.  And the room is perfect.  Simple, Not fussy.  With well placed sound absorption panels  in the ceiling to keep the noise level down even when the space is full.  And the service is perfect."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I choose this as our fancy dinner for our Montreal trip and we are very happy that we did. Since we live in the Mid-Atlantic of the US, we did not want to eat anywhere that served what we can find at home. Bullion Bilk fit this requirement perfectly. For an appetizer we had the oysters and for dinner she had the Veal and I had the Guinea Hen. The service was excellent and the food was prepared and presented to perfection. My only complaint was that the oysters were a bit pricey and they did not have much flavor although adimittedly, we are a bit spoiled due to the fact that the oysters from the Chesapeake region are almost always readily available to us and their salty flavor is much different from those found in British Columbia. Overall, I would recommedn this restaurant to anyone visitng Montreal."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner here. The food was amazing and the service was great. Every dish was unique and incredibly tasty. Be bold and try everything, especially the lobster and the desserts."}
{"text":"The five course tasting menu is terrific. The courses are: 
1. Shrimp in a thin layer of daikon radish with shimeji mushrooms, a touch of ginger, and shishito peppers. 
2. Two pieces of Hamachi sashimis with a slightly sour sauce that also had some soy sauce flavor. Very fresh material but the flavorful sauce kind of overshadows the fish
3. Cavatelli with crab and green peas. This is my favorite dish! A light pasta in a savory light yellow sauce with refreshing flavor from the peas. The crab was a highlight. 
4. Beef and foie gras with truffle and fiddleheads. Foie gras was pretty good. Beef came medium (they didn't ask us how we wanted it) and was okay. We thought it would be great if was more tender. I've never fiddlehead before but it had an interesting texture. 
5. Rhubarb dessert with white chocolate and pistachio crumbles. It wasn't too heavy and had a lot of interesting flavors: rhubarb, pistachio, hibiscus, and lychee (even though we couldn't taste this one)"}
{"text":"Delicious, great service, but the portions were tiny.  Had to go get some wings afterwards."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Toronto and Bouillon Bilk has got to be one of the best restaurants during my Montreal trip. We tried the tasting menu so we could have a little bit of everything and it definitely did not disappoint. Food was phenomenal and so innovative! Don't worry, you will be full"}
{"text":"J'ai eu la chance d'essayer ce resto il y a quelques semaines et j'ai ADORÉ! Malheureusement, le détail de ce que j'ai mangé m'échappe, mais je me souviens avoir fait de belles découvertes et avoir eu de très belles surprises. Les plats étaient \"simples\" mais très gouteux et de qualité. Par \"simples\", j'entends que les plats étaient composés de peu d'ingrédients, mais d'extrême qualité. Tout était très gouteux. J'y retournerai certainement!"}
{"text":"Really a 4.5.

Had an excellent meal there on a recent stay in Montreal.  Very sure hand in the kitchen.  Bright, vivid tastes; lovely plating; very nice, attentive wait staff.  A main course of duck was especially good.

We really enjoyed ourselves here.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The restaurant's ambiance is bustling, the space a bit cramped, and the food AMAZING...honestly one of the best places I've eaten at in a very long time. Every dish we had, from oysters to calamari to shrimp linguine to profiteroles, etc. was so tasty. I wanted to go back again for lunch the next day but it was unfortunately closed. A true gem....have to go back when I'm next in town!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in montreal!! The first time i went was perhaps threw years ago. I don't remember exactly what I ate but I remember that ai enjoyed every dish especially the pasta. 

I came back yesterday night with my boyfriend and it still lived up to my expectations. We showed up thirty min late and luckily they still kept our table. We showed up at 8 pm but our just for laughs show was at 9:30 pm. We each ordered the five course tasting menu and we told them we were in a hurry so they brought everything super fast and we made it to our comedy show. Not only was our service fast but they were very attentive and made sure to ask if we wanted another drink. The bloody Caesar was nothing special but the imported red wine I had was awesome! I wish they had it at the SAQ!

We started with the shima-aji (fish from Japan ) with elder berries, blackcurrant, cucumber and dill. I'm not fish person but I loved it. The fish was so fresh and was not fishy at all.  We then had the veal tartare with sea urchin, cashew nuts and it came with two lavash which resembles a cracker. So good and so many different textures. Next we had the pasta which was good but did not blow my mind. It was a linguini with truffles, shrimp and green peas. Honestly it tasted like fancy instant noodles to me. According to the menu we were supposed to have duck but they didn't have any so they replaced it with lamb.  It didn't bother me because I love lamb. It looked like a duck magret but with lamb instead. The meat was fatty and cooked to perfection. The portions are not big but I was full at the end of the meal. Lastly we had the coconut dacquoise. Its like a cake with coconut and white chocolate on top. It was delicious ! It also came with a raspberry sorbet but I preferred eating it separately rather than eating it with the cake.

I definitely recommend this restaurant! Not only is the plating like art but the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Our lunch here was my favorite meal out of a long weekend in Montreal. Bouillon Bilk is located on the famous St. Laurent, in between the bar area and Chinatown. Certainly not the most appealing of areas, but as soon as you walk in the door, this light airy modern dining room greats you. Ahh...

For a lunch menu, there were quite a number of options for starters and entrees. The cooking here is modern French and everything is absolutely beautiful. The service was also very attentive and the best we had all trip as well.

CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE: Damn it's good. The mousse has a little more structure to it (meaning not too soft) but it was incredibly smooth. The brioche that it served with was equally great and oh so buttery. The toppings of fruit, a little herb, mustard seeds and crunch provided really nice contrast of flavors and textures.

SALAD: The waitress called it a chickpea salad which I think is probably inaccurate. It's mostly young spring vegetables and endives with a few pieces of green chickpeas through in. Super fresh and light.

RISOTTO WITH BRAISED RABBIT: Perfectly cooked risotto is often hard to find and this was perfect. Not too soft, plenty of sauce. And the rabbit was so tender that it really blends in to the rice.

ROBALO (or snook): I love myself crispy fish skin and this plate delivers that on top of tender fish underneath. The peas and veggies that accompanied the fish really brightened the dish overall. Excellent.

I don't have a single negative thing to say about Bouillon Bilk. It was a top notch dining experience that is definitely deserving of its high rank on Yelp!"}
{"text":"The food was very very good ! We had the degustation menu and it was really amazing and not over prized compare to what I am used to (I live in SF...). The staff was friendly and helpful, definitely a great place. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because it wasway too noisy. I like to enjoy great food in good company and in a quiet environment."}
{"text":"I was excited to dine here after having a lovely diner at Cadet earlier in the week, which is the sister restaurant to Bouillon Bilk. I was lucky enough to get in without a reservation early on a weeknight.

I dined with my partner, and we ordered:

- $17 - calamari, tomato, melon, thai basil, wild leeks, samphire
Wow. Just wow. The texture of the tomato and crisp melons perfectly complemented the taste and texture of the squid. This dish was spiced to perfection. 

- $34 walleye, dashi, peach, celery, kale, potatoes
Exquisite, and one of the best fish dishes I've had all year. The walleye was cooked perfectly, and the lightly toasted breadcrumbs added a great bit of crunch and texture to the meal. On the night that I dined in, the peaches were replaced with clementines which made for a light, fresh tasting entree. 

- $36 venison, sunchoke, coffee, hazelnuts, turnip, onion
The venison stole the show. Again, perfectly cooked (see a trend here?). It was medium rare on the inside, tender, and flavorful. The coffee and hazelnuts added a smokey rich taste, while the bites of turnip and onion were refreshing in comparison. Perfectly executed. 

(prices in CAD)

The freshly baked bread was the perfect accompaniment to the meal, and I used it to soak up the sauces and juices of the dishes I tried throughout the night.

The service was impeccable and the waiter made a great recommendation for a glass of red wine to go with my veal.

This was the highlight of my week of dining in Montreal, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to treat their tastebuds to an amazing experience. For the quality and preparation, Boullion Bilk is well worth the price."}
{"text":"At Bouillon Bilk, there's no mistake in blindly picking a dish from the menu because everything is just so good! 

Service is excellent. Couldn't ask for a better server. Attentive and knowledgeable. 

The food is presented like a work of art and tastes as good as it looks.

There's a discovery of new flavors and textures for every bite you take. Everything on the menu is minimally described but once you get to taste your dish, you'll notice that there's a lot more going on. A spoonful of one side of the dish will not taste the same as the other side. It's almost like exploring a huge new world that is on your plate but you don't know where to start and where to go but everything seems so right.

You don't go there to eat, you go there to experience."}
{"text":"Très bonne table dans le Quartier des Spectacles ! Voulant célébrer l'anniversaire de ma copine, quelle meilleure occasion de l'inviter au Bouillon Bilk. De l'entrée (Entrée de crabe 18$), au plat principal (Pétoncles 31$) et au dessert (Dessert du jour 10$), vins, tout était à la perfection, tant au niveau du goût et de la présentation. Délicieux. Déco intérieure, neutre et moderne. Bon service de la serveuse. Un endroit pour passer une belle soirée en bonne compagnie pour des occasions spéciales et surtout bien manger.

5/5 visité en mai 2015"}
{"text":"Save up and come to Bouillon Bilk as fast you can. It's one of those restaurants that are worth spending your anniversary/birthday/payday. People should know this is not a restaurant where portions are big. It's all about the quality of the ingredients. If you're up for trying new food, the tasting menu is the way to go. Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Before dessert, we discussed how bad the  final course would have to be to decrement our 5-star review.  The consensus was that it would have required live insects in the ice cream.  Didn't happen.

Simply incredible from start to finish.  Decor is modern, minimalist, clean, and somehow still cheeky (sign from the failed electronics shop still graces the front door).  Inventive, counterintuitive cocktails.  Red snapper tartare amuse bouche demanded notice with just a little citrus.  The second best magret de canard I have ever tasted - firm and dark.  Scallops with the perfect blend of light texture and creamy insides.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable: after I rejected my first wine pairing, the bartender happily suggested an intriguing shade-grown chilean red.

I visited Montreal looking for something special, and BB delivered."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I've been there twice, once for lunch once for dinner. I surprised that there no evident mark of the restaurant name outside. Thus, it's a little bit hard to find this restaurant for the first time. The indoor design is simple but comfortable. The ambiance is quite good with sunshine in the afternoon and the light at the night. The presentation of dishes is beautiful and the food tastes delicious!!! I really appreciate the chef's thorough understanding and remarkable idea about different ingredients, different combinations and also different cuisines. The list of wine is also satisfying. Also the service is adorable. In one word, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"\"Don't judge a book by its cover\" is what I learned after dining here.  I was very confused by the sign/facade of this restaurant at first.  Elegant yet casual and comfortable decor and ambiance inside.  The food itself was creative, beautifully presented, and priced more than reasonably. A must-go-to for anyone visiting the city."}
{"text":"Unassuming from the outside you might think your not in the right place however you are. Simple simple simple is the theme here, white walls and black accents. Clean and modern however nothing impressive. 6/10

The service was personalized and attentive. 9/10

The food. Fresh bread, amazing apps and mains. We only ate appetizers as we were not so hungry. The hamachi was delicate. The beef in a mushroom sauce was tender and salty goodness. The amuse bush was to die for. Dessert didn't turn any heads even though I tried the plaet. 8/10"}
{"text":"Maybe because I'm not quite into raw food. The decor is simple  We tried duck, crab and beef. To be honest, I do love the crab, very fresh and tasty. Plus the shape is so creative. Other is not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"Un sans-faute
 
Un restaurant plutôt discret de par son emplacement et son apparence. La devanture toute vitrée donne directement sur la salle et les tables. Il faut s'approcher du renfoncement de l'entrée pour découvrir le nom de l'enseigne apposé sur un mur brut. L'intérieur plante un décor minimaliste, classe et moderne.
 
Recherchées et minutieuses, les assiettes exposent des palettes de couleurs et de textures. De nombreux ingrédients composent la scène. À chaque élément décrypté un à un, une émotion. Aucun ne prend le dessus sur l'autre; au contraire, chacun joue un rôle clé tendant vers un ensemble sublimé. La qualité et la fraîcheur des mets ne sont pas à prouver. Sans parler de la viande qui jure de tendreté.
 
Pour ma part, je n'ai choisi que les spécialités du jour.
Entrée: Crabe des neiges du Québec, vinaigrette à la lime, crème sure à la carotte, pois verts, croûtons aux amandes, amandes vertes, oseille sanguine 
Plat: Duo de boeufs - contre-filet et joue fumés et braisés, pommes de terre aux lardons, crème sure, oignons caramélisés, champignon Portobello, poireaux et pois verts
Dessert: Gâteau éponge, confiture de fraise, gel à la fraise, lait d'avoine, sorbet crème sure et fraise, granité au babeurre (lait battu)
 
Alors que mon conjoint, lui, a préféré les plats de la carte. (Anyway, à chacun de nos restos, nous mangeons la moitié de l'assiette de l'autre.)
Entrée: Saumon fumé, rutabaga, poire asiatique, moutarde, riz sauvage
Plat: Cerf, topinambour, quinoa, noix de Grenoble, pied bleu, café-chocolat
Dessert: Ganache, noisettes, citron, bergamote, crème 
 
Big up au serveur qui a eu la gentillesse de me donner une feuille et un stylo ainsi que la patience de me dicter les spécialités du jour tandis que je recopiais mot pour mot comme si j'étais à l'école -_- 
 
Mon coup de coeur: Tous les plats que j'ai goûtés, sans exception.
 
Mon astuce: Vu la popularité, réserve à l'avance.

{"text":"Very nice trendy atmosphere with great food! Very busy on a Sunday night, could only get reservations for 9:30 at night but asked them to call if they had earlier cancellation. Got lucky with 8:30 cancellation. 

We all started with Foie Gras appetizer, it was so good we ordered seconds. Waiter was very accommodating and rushed out second portion before entrees. Fried Veal Sweetbreads and Lobster was great pairing. Seared Arctic Char was cooked perfectly with nice crust on skin.

Desserts were all very refreshing. Ricotta Cream Meringue with berries, Tamarind Cake, and Hazelnut Cake were all great way to top off the meal."}
{"text":"Got space at the counter without a reservation.

Shared the incredible côte de boeuf, which came with fingerling potatoes, asparagus, and very interesting mushrooms. Everything was incredible, and they had some decent beer options as well."}
{"text":"Delicious meal with amazing atmosphere and ambiance. Service was excellent and waiters are very knowledgeable of the menu and ingredients in the dishes. Wide range of wine choices available. Overall excellent experience! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful take on modern gourmet Canadian/North-American cuisine. The restaurant itself is bare-walled and plain, and it's very a loud yet somehow intimate setting. The waitstaff was a bit cold, but they were generally helpful with any questions we had with the menu.

My friend ordered the rabbit and ravioli, and I ordered the halibut two ways (fried and sous-vide). The portions here appear small, but they aren't ludicrously small. After the bread and my entree, I was satisfied. The halibut was excellent fried and even better sous-vide; I'd never had sous-vide before, but it was incredibly tender and moist.

After the meal, we ordered the yogurt & mango & papaya dessert, and it was excellent. Seriously the most creative and delicious dessert I've ever had. Each component of the dessert blended together beautifully while being distinct flavors. The contrast of texture was something that I've never seen executed so masterfully in a dessert. You must order this dessert!"}
{"text":"Very chic farm to table restaurant in Montreal has all the elements of a great restaurant.  Wine list was quite good with some reasonably priced gems.  Service was great and very attentive to all our requests (in English of course).  The highlights of the meal included the Hamachi appetizer, duck Margaret (two types of ducks) perfectly cooked, and the exceptional scallops.  If I lived here I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite french restaurants in montreal.it might look like a hole in the wall with the supersystem sign in front of the restaurant but once you enter the restaurant you will have a great night.it will start beautifully with one of the best front of house in montreal,you are always well greated and seated and notified if there is wait time.the menu description may at times seem eccentric with exotic fruits and spices -protein pairing but everything seem to come out well balanced and harmonious with a beautiful plating.the wine is great and the service professional and polite.it is the kind of place i keep coming back over the years and can only recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant became, immediately, my new favorite restaurant in all of Montreal. As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit. The food here is absolute perfection. 

Everyone at the table raved about the food. Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture. This place defines culinary execution. I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.  The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean. That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last. The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes. A million kudos the the chef. 

The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes. 

All in all this made for the perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"OMG! Everything here is heavenly including the food, the atmosphere and the staff. It's expensive but well worth it."}
{"text":"Returned here for the 4th time in the last 12 months. Time to give some props finally. We are from Toronto and every time we come to Montreal we eat here. An amazing dining experience. The restaurant is upscale, the staff very professional and knowledgable and the ingredients, inventions and presentations are superb, and all this pulled off without pretentious or stuffy airs. Located in an unassuming strip away from restaurant and club districts. 

I had the foie gras starter w/ white asparagus, broccolini, strawberry
Main was ricotta stuffed ravioli with rabbit, fava beans and tomato
Rhubarb/juniper berry dessert

My only comment was that you better really like juniper if you are having this dessert. It is very forward in the flavour profile. 

We will be back as often as we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent and met expectations. First time trying sweetbreads and I was a little squeamish but they were delicious! This may sound weird but their coffee was one of the best cups I've had. My other 3 guests also enjoyed everything as much as I did."}

{"text":"Was not impressed by this place. In my view over rated. Would have liked to actually eat a bit more for over $100 per person. Nice presentation though and desert was a nice twist on the classic mille-feuille. That's the most positive comment I can make. Was expecting more...."}
{"text":"I've visited Bouillon Bilk twice, and they do absolutely delicious food: extremely innovative tomatoes and smoked mussels appetizer, and the veal, duck, and scallops were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. On my second visit there, however, the service left something more to be desired. While our waiter was attentive enough with water and drink refills and such, he made several condescending comments that left quite a sour taste in our mouthes. For instance, he called me out for being impolite for soaking up the remaining sauce on my plate with the bread. He was also acted quite surprised when my partner announced he worked at a restaurant the server hadn't heard of and was also not the head chef there. What's it to you, monsieur? Overall, great food, but get a grip."}
{"text":"We started with a dozen ultra fresh oysters and multiple accoutrements. Then the scallops which were expertly prepared and the flavors alongside were an excellent pairing. Service was top notch and the entire a staff was attentive and welcoming. I would definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This was a nice evening, but honestly for the high price tag (I think it was $350 for the two of us) I expected more. I've done a number of prixe fixe tasting menus in different locations. While you can choose to order a la carte here, we went with the tasting menus. I did the 5-course tasting menu and my  husband went with the 8, which included the same 5 but had 3 additional courses. 

While many of the dishes were creative, I actually think they overdid it with trying to be overly creative with flavors, and many of the foods seemed to lack cohesion to me. Some dishes had one bite that would be really great and another that was a bit chaotic, with too many competing flavors. I also felt like some of the wine pairings weren't ideal. There were so many ingredients in each course that I am sure I'm missing a bunch, but I tried to recall most of what we had: 

1st course: sparkling beer, fried clams with peppers, some crunchy things served on a long thin shell. 
The clams were tasty, and the sparkling beer was a nice start. There were a lot of flavors. 

2nd course: red snapper, cucumber, sesame, and a bunch of other things paired with a cru Riesling

3rd course: ret trout, trout roe, edamamae seeds, radish salad, nectarine, paired with a chenin blanc 

4th course: venison carpaccio with strawberries, a sweet sauce, what seemed like puffed corn cereal (I really thought this detracted), served with a Morgon Cru Beaujolais

5th course: shrimp linguine with truffle oil and fava beans. This was really tasty and simple. served with a wine called la levee 14, which was a sweet, oxidized wine. I didn't think this pairing worked well. 

6th course: rabbit salad, with rabbit three ways (including rabbit liver), with potatoes, foie gras sauce, onions, brussell sprouts. served with a Bourgogne pinot noir (one of the better pairings)

7th course: fig tartlet with swiss raw milk cheese and greens, served with vin de voile. pretty nice.

8th course (dessert): ice gream, gin, yogurt, berries, white chocolate, jelly, something crunchy. I don't know what to call it but it was an interesting combination of flavors, textures, and temperatures. It was served with a dessert wine (Jurancon?) that was tasty. 

Again, nice experience, but I don't think I'd come back when there are so many other options to try."}
{"text":"Bouillon Bilk (BB) is one of the few places in Montreal that all my chef friends consistently recommend. They pay attention to what these folks are doing. I've been here for lunch or dinner well over 30 times the last few years (I often take work-related visitors for dinner here) and have never been disappointed. Menu changes occur sufficiently often that it makes little sense to give details about the specific dishes I tried this time. While some restaurants tend to be better at delivering certain types of dishes, I feel that BB is consistent - I don't remember ever having a dish that I didn't like and the highlights over time cannot be classified as a specific type.

BB is also a very stylish spot and the service staff are helpful and extremely pleasant.

This is one of my favorite food destinations in Montreal. To reiterate: of my favorites, it is also the most consistent at delivering a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful and elegant restaurant 
Very sophisticated menu
One of the best in the city 
A definitely must!!!
I went there with a group of friends ... and from the minute i walked in ... my mind was set \" am having tasting menu \"
So when the whole table had ordered and it was finally my turn ... i was told i couldn't get tasting menu ... as the whole table must absolutely have it ... 
so me not being ready ( i never even took a glimpse at the menu ) i ended up ordering something 
That was very good ... but still not impressed for a restaurant of this quality ..!!!
The flavours and creativity were there at every dish my group had ... 
but i think i have had better food somewhere else 

Again this place is among the best in the city ... and is a must if you are a foodie !!!"}
{"text":"Omg what a great restaurant!! I am in awe with this place. No wonder that they are among the best restaurants in Canada(no 34 out of 100 in 2017). Hubby took me here for my birthday. We took the 5 service tasting menu with wine pairing. We could of gotten the 8 service for a little more but I don't eat that much and most of the time, Felix helps me finish my plates lol! Our waitress Marie-Alex was extraordinary! She was so amazing that it only made the evening so much more memorable. For example: there was a course in the 8 service that we really wanted to try and she made it happen for us for only a 10$ extra (for both. Not each!). EVERYTHING was on point and delicious. From the bread and butter to the last crumb in the dessert! This restaurant is a \"special occasion\" restaurant for us due to the price. But boy it's so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, the service, and the atmosphere. We tried the tasting menu and it was like being in a museum. Every single dish (of the total 8 plates) was amazing. My favorites were the duck and the linguini. Totally recommend it, though it's pricey."}
{"text":"Une des meilleure table où j'ai mangé à Montréal!! Service impeccable et les plats sont tous savoureux!!"}
{"text":"The meals are very heavy, good portion with decent prices. We were 4 and spent about $300-400. The food was good but it's very creamy and heavy ( we tried different things on the menu, so it's not just one or two specific choices that were heavy). Recommend to try once, by not a spot to go often."}
{"text":"Our third thoroughly enjoyable dinner in Montreal.  A bit fancier in terms of decor than Hoogan et Beaufort (industrial chic) and Les 400 Coups, and perhaps more classically French in terms of sauces and preparation.  A white tablecloth restaurant but to our surprise many guests were very, very casually dressed.  

Anyhow, the meal was delicious.  We started with the salmon tartare amuse bouche, followed by fois gras (am relieved my husband now orders his own fois gras instead of attempting to eat mine).  My entree was the thinly sliced beef done tataki style -- barely seared and raw in the middle, while my husband had the guinea fowl with a fois gras sauce.  Dessert was the Paris Brest with caramel sauce flavored with bacon.  A delicious meal, with great service."}
{"text":"This resto is considered one of the 25 best in Canada and I'm a believer. I started with a delightful parsnip and cauliflower cream soup; the lip of the soup bowl was decorated with thin slices of apple and lightly pickled cauliflower. Next, a halibut ceviche (waxy texture and outstanding flavour) with pecans and almonds on a bed of crème fraîche which was a revelation. Then when I thought it couldn't get any better, crémeux chocolat, a delightful marriage of milk chocolate mousse-like peaked cones and dark chocolate cake bits complemented by candied orange and a bittersweet citrus sauce. Including a local gin martini and an espresso the total was a very reasonable $50 solo. The service was polished, the atmosphere casual. A perfect meal."}
{"text":"Very good food. Possibly a little too much emphasis on the design and not quite enough on the depth of taste. The service was excellent and all in all , for the price it was well worth it. 

They did mess up royally on the cheesecake which had a crust made entirely of salt. At a restaurant of this calibre, that is a major error. They threw in a small desert for free but the salty taste of the cheesecake kind of ruined the memory of the dinner. I would still go back though."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. We were 6 friends, and tried all the appetizers, I couldn't tell you wich one is my favourite. Main meal amazing as well. Tried the dessert with seared foie gras... omg..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a newer place for a special meal and saw some good reviews for Bouillon Bilk.  Fine cuisine with a flair for combining and transforming ingredients.  Interestingly, the menu only provides you with a list of ingredients rather than a description of what it is.  Your waiter, however, will describe each detail in great detail.  Also interestingly, what we had picked out from the menu was not at all what we ended up ordering after hearing the descriptions.

The sommelier was excellent.  He brought us three wines as possible pairings for our choices and we even got to taste each one before making a decision.  The service is not rushed - some might say slow - but we don't mind that at all.  

All of our plates were delicious - to some extent there isn't much point in describing what we had as the menu changes constantly.  One thing I noticed was that it seemed to me that there was a Korean influence on the dishes.  This isn't Asian Fusion, but something in the choices of seasonings and accompaniments made me think Korean.

The one drawback for us was the ambiance.  We were looking for a more intimate setting for this meal, but one almost had the impression of sitting in a cafeteria.  Simple square tables tightly packed in increased the noise level and decreased the sense of intimacy.  

So go for the food, not the romance."}
{"text":"A chef at another local restaurant said I had to go here, that it was one of his favorite places in Montreal. I would have to say he was spot on in the suggestion. The food was delicious. We started out with the ricotta ravioli with lambs ragu. Nice starter, with the grapes making the dish unique. In addition we got the amuse-bouche of lobster bisque and crayfish, a few spoons fulls of creamy, salty flavor with tenderly cooked crayfish. I ordered the venison which was cooked at a perfect medium rare, the meat was a simple salt is pepper crust, however that's all it needed to respect the meat for what it was. The others got the Guinea hen which had a crispy buttery skin, and the scallops which were quote \"the best scallops I've ever had\" (which she has had a lot of scallops in her life). Finished off with the pumpkin cake which followed suit with the whole meal."}
{"text":"I went here for an anniversary dinner and was very pleased. Would come again for an occasion.

Food: fantastic. Everything we tried had great flavors and textures, and was enjoyable to eat and share. The serving sizes could use minor upgrades, however. The wine selection was also great.

Service: the staff is kind and professional and the service was timely.

Price: it's pricey, of course, but that's exactly what I expected given the context. I think the food fulfilled its value in price.

Ambiance: had a standard fine dining feel, but I loved the design of this place, both outside and inside. It has this very classy minimalist look to it that I really liked. It's not particularly over the top fancy but I would dress nicely when heading here. Loved the atmosphere here."}
