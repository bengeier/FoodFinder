{"text":"We were in the neighborhood, and we felt like having some sushi...

The place is small, only 3 tables. There's an ice cream parlor / banh mi counter inside a sushi restaurant, it might seem weird, but then again if you go to Vua sandwich which is a banh mi place that also sells sushi, it kind of makes sense for the lunch crowd.

One clever thing about the menu and ordering is the menu is laminated and you get a marker and just highlight what you want. It's not an all you can eat sushi but I thought that was a cool idea to not waste paper. The owner is quite charming and very welcoming which makes you feel at home.

On to the food. We ordered 3 makis each, I ordered the seafood salad, and my friend ordered a seafood miso soup.

The salad was amazing, it had seaweed some lettuce and topped with shrimp and some sashimi, tuna, salmon and some white fish, check out the picture. It is beautiful to look at and tasted very fresh. The vinaigrette was just right.

The makis were very colorful, two of them were wrapped in soya wraps, one was a rainbow roll and another was wrapped in cucumber.

Some rolls came with their own sauce, one was white creamy sauce, it tasted like the japanese wafu salad dressing, it tasted really good. Another sauce tasted like hoi sin sauce but mixed with something tangy and had a kick of spicy in it, that one was used with the cucumber roll. All the rolls were coloful and tasted amazing. I feel like this is such a good throwback sushi joint where the menu is limited but the sushi is made with care and the attention to detail really makes a difference.

The fish were very fresh and soft, it melted in your mouth. I was pleasantly delighted that a small place like this had such fresh ingredients.

For those of you looking for asian flavored ice cream, they do have many flavors, from mango to coconut to DURIAN!!! yes durian, wow that's really rare to find in montreal.

I was informed by the owner that they just started offering mousse, chocolate mousse, mango mousse, and other flavors. We each had one, I had chocolate and my friend had chocolate and rasberry. It had rich chocolaty flavor without the bitterness, not too sweet, just right.

I did not try the banh mi yet because we were so full, but I would definitely pass by during lunch just to try their banh mi and grab a vietnamese coffee :)"}

I had a plate of ready-made sushi as well as a vietnamese sandwich.

It's pretty similar to the sushi take-out you've had everywhere else in the city.
Not better and not worse.

I will give them another chance, especially try the more creative rolls."}
{"text":"I know what you're saying... It's about time I tried the local sushi place! But, you see, the thing is, usually when I have a craving for sushi, I am nowhere near home... Except tonight... As I was slowly settling in for the evening, thinking \"hey it's Friday night and I really don't feel like cooking plus it's bloody warm in here there's no way I'm turning on the oven\", suddenly I heard it, the slow and sweet cry of the sushi. \"What am I to do?\" I asked myself! \"I don't know where to get sushi around here!\" \"No worries\", my other self told me, \"Yelp the closest sushi place and everything will be fine\". So, listening to myself, I did, found this place and ran as if hell itself was after me...
The place is nice, very welcoming and clean. The menu has a lot to choose from - Really? I just want sushi, please don't make me read through all of this to choose which ones, Iiiiiii juuuuuuust waaaaaaant sushiiiiiiiis! But, the people behind the counter are very friendly and ready to help you through any cravings issues. I took my combo (a set of 14 variety), my seaweed salad and pretty much shoved everything down.
So sure it isn't the best sushi you will eat in your life - nothing exciting, nothing amazing -, but they definitely aren't the worst either and they beat that Sushi place on the market... Plus, the fishes and vegetables are fresh which (trust me) is a very good point. And now, I know where to run to, next time I have such a craving around home :-)"}
