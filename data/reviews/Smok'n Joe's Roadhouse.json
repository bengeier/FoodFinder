{"text":"The food tasted okay, but the buns for my sandwich looked (and tasted) like they bought them off the shelf at Walmart. The service was good. I suspect it was only because there were only ten guests in the entire restaurant. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today.  The staff were very friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere was nice.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  This should be a quick easy order to fill considering I was one of two customers, but it took half an hour to get my food out.  When I finally got my food I was unimpressed.  Bland meat next to a standard bun.  The fries were tasty though.  I hope they get their act together, because it really is a nice place with friendly staff.  I'll give them another shot once they've been open longer."}
{"text":"This is a huge improvement over the last bar that occupied this spot. They obviously put a few bucks into the renovation and added pool tables. The rub is that when a band is playing here it totally dominates the conversation, and if the band sucks...    Please put in a smoking-friendly patio, right now customers have to stand by the parking lot sans drink! They have another less-noisy bar in the front, which I was pleased to discover was offering $1 well drinks from 9-10pm for guys -  we took full advantage."}
