{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Hush puppies are hard to find these days and they were great.  Food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"Terrible pork, disgusting sauce and depressing atmosphere.  Steer clear."}
{"text":"Service was good, however my salad came out warm, my slaw came out warm, and my pulled pork came out cold, go figure. The sauces couldn't help the bland meat. The down town Concord location much better. 1st and last time visiting this location. next time I'll go to R&R, or Sonnys. The credited the food but it was too late for me. Spent 30 dollars might as well flushed it down the dirty bathroom toilet. Sorry for the bad review but i work hard for my money and hate wasting it on crappy food. I like to support local business but damn this place."}
{"text":"This joint is worn, and a little tattered, and not just around the edges - the kind of place that aspires to one day, with some fixing up, be a dive, and this is the place they moved into - don't even ask about the old one. This restaurant has been around and stays busy, but frankly, the barbecue is not what it once was, and the service has suffered as well in the larger building.

The chopped barbecue is sort of a hybrid, more Eastern than Lexington, but not quite either. The chop is moderate, and it comes sauced from the kitchen, tender, moist, but no smokiness. The net result is a bland product that often arrives luke warm. I'd pass on the barbecue, there is better in Concord.

Now the breakfast here is very good, and portions ample. They have the usual breakfast menu items, with a twist or two, like liver pudding, which I happen to like, once in a while. And some of the country cooking items, especially the CS Steak,  are excellent. And the hot dog here is especially good - nice chili, soft bun, red wiener.

The service here is inconsistent - pretty good one time, in the toliet the next, and this can be true whether it is a peak time or not. Old girls, they do get weary."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets even one star is because the server was friendly. The pit-smoked ribs I was served for lunch were undercooked to the point that they would not pull apart and was pink in spots. I showed the server when she finally came to check on us and she apologized and said she'd tell the cook. Didn't offer to replace them, but I really wasn't willing to give them another go since being served undercooked pork the first time. The sides were unremarkable and the hushpuppies were tough, tasteless little balls of dough that appeared to have been fried earlier and kept warm. We won't be going back there again."}
