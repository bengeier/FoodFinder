{"text":"As usual as Second Cup does. Cheap brewed coffee and good dessert! 9415secret code9415"}
{"text":"This has become my Canadian Starbucks. Which I think kind of is. Free wifi!! Baristas were very helpful with recommendations and information."}
{"text":"I really like this location, especially in the summer when their patio is open! It's not very busy most of the time - at least, I've never had any trouble getting a seat. 

My only issue, and it's really a non-issue, is the staff. Most of them are nice enough, but no one really engages with the customers. One staff I see regularly seems downright annoyed at having to serve customers. On the whole it doesn't bother me too much, but it is something I've noticed. 

Overall, it's a great stop if you're in Bloor West Village and want something familiar. Definitely come by in the summer and check out the patio!"}
{"text":"Our first Second Cup experience since arriving in Canada! Lovely staff, for a start - they were more than happy to recommend us (total novices) their favourite cakes! Very decent filter coffee, and a nice atmosphere too. We'll definitely be back for more cake."}
{"text":"I don't like their coffee much as its too dry for my liking but it is strong which I like. Their store location is great!

This store is decent in size. The size allows them to provide more seating and they also have free wifi. I saw a lot of downtowners have a coffee and using wifi.

The service was really good, both personal were friendly and accommodating to the changes and request of people. The washrooms are clean compared to what i have seen and the Manager came off duty and was checking the toilets and told them to clean the ladies."}
{"text":"Super unimpressed.

Although it's great that this Second Cup is open until 1am on Saturday, it would help if there was actually staff manning the counter. Melissa D. and I wanted to end our night with a hot drink, so we waited... and waited... and waited. We even looked for a bell to ring, and came up empty handed. 

Finally, I went back to the washroom area to investigate, and an employee was emptying the trash. I politely asked if we were able to order something, and she barked back (as if I were REALLY inconveniencing her), 'ya, I'm just in the middle of doing something'. So, sufficed to say, still not impressed.

Even after the rude treatment, we still waited for her to finish so we could get our hot drink. But guess what, she never showed, so we left... hot drink-less, and treat-less. We also had our eyes on the cookies.

Sorry Second Cup, I won't be back - this was straight up poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Coffee shop with a quiet small back yard. Coffee is strong, and there is a good selection of pastries. They have lactose-free milk among their milk options and gluten free baked goods. Fast and friendly service..."}
{"text":"Worst coffee I've had in a very long time.  My Americano tastes like some heated up dishwater that was used to clean ash trays.  This should not be happening."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to get your caffeine fix right next to the St. Lawrence Market. The staff is friendly and prompt and the bathrooms are clean. Comfy chairs and tables abound next to fireplaces and a good view of the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Came here for a dark roast cup of coffee and oatmeal cookie for the lil one. The coffee was pretty good. They have a table to put your own milk and sugar like starbucks plus cute and colorful (don't know the name of them) sticks to put in the opening of your cup so your coffee doesn't spill out . The cookie was soft and good. Quick, friendly service, nice people, no problem."}
{"text":"Important update: I had the same experience at another second cup that they pour coffee into a paper cup before into my mug! But they explained they re-use the paper cup, its their way of ensuring we get the right amount of coffee. Ok, makes sense.

Bump-up to 2-stars for this location (4 stars and beyond for St. Michaels, St. Joes, the Waterfront, and Bay & College locations!)"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick 6:30 am coffee before a meeting. Employee was rude, coffee had something in it, toilet was backed up, air hand dryer broken."}
{"text":"It's just like all the other Second Cups, really, except this one hadn't run out of their apple cider mix. 

Second Cup apple cider is probably the best of the chain apple ciders, and a friend of mine living in Hong Kong recently put out a plea on Facebook for apple cider. Hence, my search. 

All the specialty shops were sold out (duh, it's CHRISTMAS) and so I thought, \"Second Cup?\" and I tried a few but this was the only one who had any regular apple cider left (not cranberry-cider). 

So kudos for that."}
{"text":"Looks a bit run down. I came in looking to redeem some points for coffee beans but they were having issues with the system so I left empty handed.

The person behind the counter was nice but not very knowledgeable and looked a bit overwhelmed even though there was only 3 people in the place.

I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Ok so I stopped in here to get a blended mocha on a hot July day. The staff was friendly, the drink was delivered quickly and it was tasty! Can you ask for more?"}
{"text":"Eh, could've been better. Their iced coffee was a little sweet for my liking (without added sugar I might add) but that doesn't mean it was bad. We didn't try any of their food because we were just popping in for a small pick me up. Their sizes are a bit on the small size though, but that could be my American opinion. If you're looking for a grande, make sure to get the large if your starbs fans catch my drift."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a trip since it's the Canadian version of Starbucks. I had the maple Frappuccino and it was pretty good! Service was good! I definitely would come here again if I am ever in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's Saturday morning, and I need to kill some time and use a toilet. Why not go to the coffee shop and drink a latte on the John? Second cup is the nearest; thank you Yelp. I walk in and I'm struck by the cramped atmosphere. The place is very small. The staff have sour attitudes. The cashier didn't really comprehend English (she said \"what it means?\" (sic) as a reply to my order). The barista leaves my order on the counter and barely musters to announce that it is ready, and avoids eye contact when I pick it up and say thank you. I go to the men's room to have a leisurely sit down. I find the bathroom equally cramped. Old industrial 'round' doorknobs (not handles) with sticky surfaces. There is no hook in the bathroom to hang my jacket. I try to hang my jacket from the loose screw sticking out of the door-closer bracket, which is not attached to the door. The jacket wont stay put. I take a sip of my coffee and hate it. Feeling the 'last straw' I leave the bathroom, abandon my coffee at the counter and go down the street to a different coffee shop (rhymes with Bar Tux) where I get the opposite experience. The barista is upbeat and understands my order. He asks how I'm doing. He offers food samples. He makes conversation. I go to the bathroom to attend to bodily needs and find the bathroom large, in good repair, and yes there is a coat hook. My Saturday morning is saved. In summary: Second Cup needs to get this location cleaned up to today's cleanliness and customer service standards."}
{"text":"6/24/15: First Canadian restaurant I have ever tried!  Seems very similar to Starbucks (which we passed a ton of on the way too btw.)

1. Classic Butter Tart C$2.50:  I liked it. Like a pecan tart but with caramel flavor. 6/10

2. Vanilla Bean Latte Medium C$4.45: About what you would expect. 5/10

And now that I got some sugar in me from the 4hr flight from San Francisco and one hour spent with the highly unfriendly EZ rental car company... I'm read to eat Canada all up!

3/5

{"text":"Very welcoming staff and wonderful selection! I go here almost everyday. There items are reasonably priced and are of good quality! Love love love!"}
{"text":"Ain't nothing but a 'scup, y'all. It's got your standard scuppy acooterments, from the wall-to-wall brown finishes, that Second-cup-smell (it's cross between burnt chocolate and grandmother) and comforable seating. 

At the southeast corner of Front and Church the windows are great for letting in lots of natural light or for looking wistfully out into the intersection and wondering where your life went wrong. Then you take another sip of your vanilla bean latte and sigh. You could have been a dancer. You shouldn't have given up so easily.

Mm, that's a good vanilla bean latte.

Obligatory Title Pun: Need a SECOND chance?

Menu Readability: I refuse to dignify this with a response.

Need to mention: Two hours of free wifi.

What this place teaches me about myself: The southeast is the most wistful of intersection corners."}
{"text":"Decent and okay coffee. No WOW factor.

I ordered the vanilla bean latte and it was definitely sweeter than lattes I've ordered.

I wanted to try this coffee shop versus your typical Starbucks but it was okay. 

I wish it had more of a caffeine coffee kick. 

I'll give it another shot and order a different menu item."}
