{"text":"While visiting Vegas for a short weekend getaway, I came by the new Grand Bazaar Shops, which is right in front of Bally's. I am surprised to find out from some of the stores that this place barely opened up last week (Vegas truly changes from month to month).  I think it is great that this little shopping area opened up, as there really wasn't anything here before, except for the long walkway leading to Bally's Hotel front entrance.   But I would say that about 40-50% of the stores are still \"coming soon\", but I am sure the next time I come visit here (which I am sure will be in the distant future... it's Vegas, how can I stay away?) It will be busy and booming. Anyways, with a ton of stores right next to each other, it reminded me of the Pacific mall in Canada. Most of the stores are of a very little space and most of the stores has an employee just waiting by the front door trying to get some business. There are a few stores that are 2 or even 3 times the size as the other stores, but this place for now is pretty much dead at the moment.   And the stores that are here are pretty expensive. Like one of the stores I walked into was a sock store. This store has some really fun socks (like the Superman & Batman socks have caps on the back of each pair) but the prices were pretty expensive ($10-18 for most).   There is a waffle place, The Lionesse Beauty Bar, Havaianas sandal store and such. Towards the back of one of the aisles, there is a guy who is selling his artfully talented art work made with the use of spray paints, ripped pages of the phone book, napkins and other scraps of paper (each painting is going for $43, includes tax).   Give this place some more time for more stores to open up, this place will be a nice place to browse around (would be nice for there to be more shade in this area though)."}
{"text":"Similar to the Container Park- lots of small shops compactly arranged in a mall-type area. Lots of variety, but currently about a third of the storefronts are still listed as \"coming soon\"- among them a gelato shop, a new location of Bronze Cafe, and a Ramen-ya.   Available businesses include Hawaii Cookie Co, a waffle shop, and Turkish Ice Cream, along with several boutique-type stores (Swarovski, Alex & Ani, Lush, a kids luggage store?) and even one that sells photos of fake Vegas marriages to fool your friends, family, and social media following.   TIP: It's a bit confusing to get to these shops because there's no signage from Bally's-  from that casino, if you just head toward the valet area and walk across the street."}
{"text":"Grand Bazaar, huh? Let me tell you a little something about the Grand Bazaar.  Now there is nothing wrong with the selection of shops and eateries here: they've got a ton of random little stores that 1) make for some real good window shopping and 2) actually house something you may want or need. I'm most thankful to find a Honolulu Cookie Company so comfortably tucked away in the corner . . . cause I love me those cookies.  What I really couldn't get over was the trek getting there . . . that was truly bizarre.  When has the Strip been littered with so many people relentlessly selling timeshares and stuff?  Dude, it's hella crazy.  Without getting into too much graphic detail, I had to make sure to averted my little ones eyes from the more adult themed stuff they were peddling on more than one occasion.  It was really quite disturbing and gross and goes against the notion of Vegas as a more family oriented destination.  Moreover, how effective is that kind of advertising in this day and age anyways?  I mean everyone knows the best place to find adult entertainment is through yelp.  duh.  search strippers.  enter.  boom.  and then uber yourself over to one of these very fine establishments.  Truth to be told, I rarely go the Strip anymore and after this recent visit, I'm definitely restricting my outings to a couple choice casinos and the Honolulu Cookie Company. Oh the perils I go through for those cookies."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I like this Strip trend of building on every single inch of their property and adding these shopping areas. There are still a lot of empty shop spaces at the Grand Bazaar Shops. And the shops that are there aren't really shops where I would purchase anything. None are really destination shops (as in someone would make a trip here to go to that store). And none really struck me as necessity shops either (as in a tourist might go there because they need or forgot to pack X, Y, or Z). It was rather uncrowded when I came here on a Saturday afternoon. And I didn't really see anyone walking around with shopping bags. So is anyone actually spending money here? I enjoyed myself window shopping, but I didn't purchase anything. There were some food places that looked good, though. Those would probably the thing that would draw me back. It's a fine enough place to walk around and kill time. And maybe even get a bite to eat. But it's not really a place I would go to actually shop."}
{"text":"Checked out the new shopping area this past weekend while some friends were visiting. Cool concept but kinda had a swapmeet market feel just nicer. Very small shops all crammed into an area. The variety of this shops seems vast but half the shops weren't open yet. It still confuses me that a lot of places open new \"shopping\" areas with half of it not actually open. I guess we will see when its all finally open."}
{"text":"Kinda small collection of shops in front of Ballys. It's def an upgrade from the plain entrance/walkway that was there before, but it's not much of an improvement. My wife (a pro shopper) liked only one store there. The one place I wanted to try (Rame-Ya) closed 20 mins early so I missed it. There was a fairly new and nice (and obligatory) Starbucks. There's slso a large new Wahlburgs burgers. Might be worth a stop if walking by, but not worth a special trip..."}
{"text":"i love all these cute little shops and restaurants...! I love it...! There Marash Authentic Turkish Ice Cream. Starbucks _ Only non franchised one, on the Strip...! And 24 hour CVS...! I love it...!"}
{"text":"They have a few cool shops here but it pales compared to the shops at Caesars or the Venetian. Still the are a few unique things like Wahlbergers and Giodanos is coming soon."}
{"text":"For a brand new shopping center on the Strip of Vegas, I fully expected nice.  This is bad.  It appears to be temporary cubicles set up in narrow straight lines.  So it just looks like a storage warehouse.  Then, there is nothing good here.  Don't waste your time in here."}
{"text":"Think of the Grand Bazaar Shops as a strip mall for those that live in a trailer park.  Other than the more open space that leads up to Bally's entrance, the other narrow claustrophobic aisles of the outer shops feel more like walking down a cell block than a outdoor market.  Most of the shops down these back aisles have gone out of business since our last visit, leaving just a few weary faced vendors peering out of their tiny cubicles.  As we walked through there recently there was nary a single other person in sight. The future of this section of the shops is dire at best.  Even our one favorite shop, The Honolulu Cookie Company, has moved on to greener pastures at The Palazzo.  Somehow the old perpetually broken moving sidewalk over the outdated water feature that lead up to Ballys doesn't seam so bad anymore."}
{"text":"A great place to stroll through and grab a bite to eat and or buy a few souvenirs! Careful though, it will be easy to leave a stone unturned if your not devoting your full attention! You don't want to miss any nook of their unique crannies nestled down each secluded aisle. Taste test Turkish ice cream, try on Superdry apparel or even reminisce with a visit to Swatch watch....& more! That is all..."}
{"text":"I recently visited the shops and was very impressed.  The people were very nice and engaging.  Yes, some were on the expensive side but all and all this is a great opportunity for small business owners.  I loved it.  I too am a business owner who has been looking for Pop-up retail locations.  I think I will look into it further."}
{"text":"As a local it's so hard to want to come down to the strip after you think about all of the potential traffic and crazy tourist! Could this be why I never even knew about the Grand Bazaar Shops? I ended up down here exploring the shops by default because there was an Elite Yelp Event that was taking place. Located right outside of the Bally's Hotel And Casino you will find this place. Restaurants, Shopping, Dining and sometimes live entertainment is what you can expect. Don't get yourself too thrilled about it though because it's not as big as you may think. In fact I find the website a bit misleading in the manner that they boast this luxury kind of feel and it's the exact opposite. I was a tab bit underwhelmed with the options of shops and dining here. I think this place is cool for something quick or if you are out and about and want to stop for a bar type setting. These little outdoor shops are becoming more and more common in Las Vegas, this one just wouldn't be on the top of my list to visit."}
{"text":"I'm becoming a fan of the Grand Bazaar Shops. I could have easily given a 2 star review back when there was a lot of empty businesses and terrible food options. Now they have a good variety of food options and most of the spaces are filled with tenants. You can enter the Grand Bazaar Shops from the Strip, but I usually enter through Bally's. Swarovski has a \"Midnight Celebration\" light and sound show every night at 9 pm. You'll want to have your camera ready when you see the Swarovski Starburst lit up it's so beautiful! The Swarovski Starburst is a 14 foot in diameter custom designed LED light fixture and you can't miss it. For food I absolutely do not recommend Pisa Pizza, instead definitely go to Giordano's for some amazingly delicious deep-dish pizza instead. Ramen-Ya, Redneck Riviera and Wahlburgers are notable mentions and once Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken opens you'll want to try their Mac and Cheese. Even though the Grand Bazaar Shops open market closes at a certain time depending if it's a weekday or weekend, it's nice that some of the restaurants and bars have extended hours."}
{"text":"This shopping area took over a landscaped shallow pool as you enter Bally's from the strip.  They may be solid buildings but it is for the most part the same kinds of hawkers you see in kiosks in shopping centers.  The day I was there the elevator to get into Bally's was broke and had a sign pointing to the also broke escalator with a sign pointing to the elevator.  So the stairs it was."}
{"text":"Even though half the stores still were not open,  we still had a fun time browsing this new shopping area.  The stores are uber tiny, but that is great because you can essentially window shop the entire store without even walking in.  The stores were also pretty unique.  It was nice to see items that you can't find in your everyday shopping center.   I'm looking forward to going back in a few months and checking it out when more stores and dining open."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the grand bazaar shoppes. I can see the beautiful lit up roof from my balcony at the Cosmopolitan and it was speaking to me. We went because we were going to dinner at the  BLT steakhouse in the Bally's. Wow was I disappointed. The concept is the new trend in Vegas which is to put shopping at street level for people walking by all the casinos. The only problem was that the stores were kind of expensive for what you were getting. The only one I even considered was the one with the cute doggy clothes named Celebi Paws but my dog won't where clothes."}
{"text":"We loved it here! Namely because of the Native American jewelry shop (some amazing finds & turquoise pieces at good prices), Giordano's Pizza, Subway, Starbucks, Alex & Ani jewelry shop, a highly regarded ramen noodle place, froyo, and Dole Whips Hawaiian ice cream tiki bar.  The rest of the shops are just ok - but we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I like the idea of more lower budget mall shops on the strip but so far this place fails to have enough to make you want to come back.  Hopefully that changes soon as better shops come up.  I also cant help but think what a waste of prime real estate this place is.  They couldnt think of something more note worthy to develop on a lot thats right in the middle of the strip?"}
{"text":"You'll likely stumble upon this shopping center if you are walking down The Strip by Bally's. It's not the most exciting variety of shops, but worth a quick stroll through if you are passing by. Another major perk is that there is a clean bathroom at the back of the shopping. A definite perk if you are walking and don't want to maze through a casino for a bathroom.  The shops are tiny, similar to the shops at Container Park. The shops include goods for purchase as well as food spots. Some notable shops are Honolulu Cookie Company, Waffle Bar, and Lush. In the middle of the shop are comfortable outdoor furniture to rest a bit.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's a worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love Grand Bazaar Shops! I love all the shops and restaurants (most of them are small businesses)! I also like how there's a light and sound show at 9 pm and 12 am! I totally recommend coming here on your free time or if your at Bally's and have nothing to do. The mall is very clean and sometimes pretty crowded, but it's a mall on the strip, expect it to be crowded everywhere. I only gave this place 4 stars because the mall seems like there's something missing to it."}
{"text":"The Grand Bazaar doesn't exactly scream \"grand,\" but it's an okay, open-air area to stroll through. It's basically a collection of shops, pop-ups, and concessions connected to Bally's. During the day, the hanging mist machines cool the place down to make strolling around a little more bearable in the summer heat. Still, it isn't exactly a popular gathering area. At night, there is a little more activity since that's when everyone goes out and passes through the area.  The middle part of the Bazaar has plenty of seating (some with large patio umbrellas), so you could just sit around and hangout for awhile. From the Waffle Bar and Ramen-ya to the sexy ladies running the mini-bar, there's a little bit of everything here. There's a Starbucks near the escalators, and a Wahlburger being built on the opposite side. Aside from a few rather overpriced clothing stores, souvenir shops, and novelty stores, you could find a ticket office (for shows on The Strip), the Marash Turkish ice cream stand, and a free phone charging area among others.  P.S.: If you're going to use the free phone charging system, don't use your real email; use a secondary one. You will need it and your phone number in order to open a locker, charge, and retrieve your phone."}
{"text":"Makeshift kiosks built into storefront structures is how I would describe this shopping area.  There was dining options and retail locations that seem to try to look like local places but, fall short.  There was one that was a bar store front type place and it just seemed odd that people would sit to have cocktails like it was a bar.  There was a hot dog shop and ample outdoor cozy seating which I enjoyed for a bit while people watching.  For me I just don't understand the lure of this place when there is much better shopping areas to take advantage of for the same price.  The only place that seemed worth visiting was the Starbucks that had amazing hot coffee (which I rarely ever say about a Starbucks) nice patio and ample outlets to charge up your electronic devices."}
{"text":"Looks good at night but weird they opened with the majority of stores not ready/months away. Should be a decent option for low cost food on the strip once its done. Low footraffic for now"}
{"text":"When it first opened up it was empty feeling and claustrophobic. And now its worse, just a place for bums and seedy people to lurk around. Its long past time to pull the plug on this diasaster. Even the poor people working in the tiny cubicles give you a please save me from this hell look when you hurriedly walk by."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what this place looks like during the day but at night it's pretty dead and dirty.  I thought it looked pretty from afar but when I got closer I was a bit disappointed.   I hope the place has improved since my visit back in November. It needs it."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to the red light district in The Netherlands, this is the retail merchandise version.    Stalls that might be too small for a pony - one after another, after another.    It is not a particularly pleasant experience to stroll through and, although they were clearly going for the open air bazaar feel, it comes across as seedy and sweaty with not enough space to move through the maze of offerings.    Hold tight to your belongings, because they could easily be bumped and lifted in the jostle of this outdoor venue."}
{"text":"For the vino Vera facial shop, dragging potential customers inside and demanding they buy your crap is a horrible business practice for one. Secondly, raising your voice asking \"why did you come in here then\" and proceeding to shout obscenities at them down the corridor as they leave is also totally  inappropriate, and borderline harassment. Surely with all that desperate thirsty begging you are doing you must understand why nobody wants to give you 500$. Get this shop out of here"}
{"text":"We love this little plaza. It has a little for everyone. Gifts, food, jewelry and of course drinks! Our favorite store is Red, its a small liqueur/convenience store with a little bit of everything. Since this is an outdoor mall it can get very hot during the summer months. They do have mists that help cool things down.   We can't wait to try Wahlburgers which just opened up!"}
{"text":"I lived in Vegas several years and had never seen this super cubicle of shops. I wish they had better directional markers so you can find the small shop you're looking for though. When I went to Tokyo Nail Art Bar Las Vegas Blvd who works there show me where the shock was because there is tons of them!"}
{"text":"The concept was fantastic. A Pike Place style market smack dab in the middle of The Strip? Who wouldn't love that, especially in comparison to the grandly underwhelming  steamship entrance that fronted Bally's in the past.   It was originally intended to open in September, but has been delayed repeatedly. About a week ago, it finally opened. Suffice to say, it wasn't much less underwhelming than what was there in the past.   Imagine four rows of boring, yet pricey, stores not much bigger than your average mall kiosk. Unlike The Linq, the architecture and the atmosphere is quite sterile and boring. It looks nice at night, since the stained glass \"roofts\" gleam lights of indigo. In the daytime the roofs look like a hot mess.   Well that was disappointing.   The Final Verdict  Pros: Fantastic concept.  Cons: Fail-tastic execution. The umpteenth location of Sugar Factory on The Strip. Everything about it is just blah.  Huh?: You guys are aware that the daylight color scheme of the \"roofs\" doesn't match the rest of Bally's, right?  Return Factor: 4/10. Maybe it might be better in the summer."}
{"text":"Terrible experience security forced me to buy something Or they said I had to leave. So I started throwing money in the trash can after I bought something. I also have video if it's hard to believe I don't lie. It was the big white guy and the supervisor, with the tattoos."}
