{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots for under $20! Fat Pasha is one Anthony Rose's well-known cohort of restaurants on Dupont. I've never been for meals besides brunch, but the restaurant is definitely worth it alone for brunch.   For 2, I like to order a Salatim (3 for $18) and an entrée (one for less than $20). The red lentil spread with Moroccan spices is divine, and so is the chopper eggplant and tahini. The Liver and Verscht on rye mini sandwich is amazing if you like chopped liver. I'd definitely return to try even more of the appetizers and salatim."}
{"text":"After reading many rave reviews of this restaurant, I convinced some friends to come with me for dinner. Overall I think Fat Pasha lived up to its hype, but I'm not sure if I would name it the best new restaurant in Toronto...   The good - the roasted cauliflower, fattoush, truffle hummus and falafel were all fantastic. They were not only flavourful, but they offered a wide variety of contrast in terms of texture and flavour.   The bad - unfortunately the ribeye for me was quite underwhelming as the quality of meat was extremely poor. The med-rare steak was difficult to cut and - as I feared - it was quite chewy. Also, while I would rather have underdone scallops than overdone scallops, I thought the seared scallops that we had were on the verge of being raw.   I would come again and probably go for the smaller plates over the larger ones as I seemed to enjoy the dishes under \"Eat Something\" far more than the larger meat plates.   Food - 8/10 Service - 8.5/10 Atmosphere - 8.5/10 Value - 8/10 Overall - 8/10"}
{"text":"We went to Fat Pasha with good expectations having read all the reviews. The food was great -- the only disappointment was the Sabih sandwich. Overall, we left feeling stuff and happy. A bit pricey.  HOW MANY PEOPLE: -Two people. We reserved ahead of time for a 1:30 p.m. lunch.  WHAT WE ORDERED: Food: -Pasha Plate with Hummus ($14) -Salatim (salad combo - 3 for $14) with Labneh evoo za'atar; tahini, everything bagel spice; and chopped eggplant and tahini -Sabih ($12) -Pita ($1.50 - we ordered extra pita because what came with the food was not enough!) Drinks: -Cocktails: Nahal '83 ($13), Punch & Judy ($15)  DETAILS: We were excited to come to Fat Pasha and generally, we were not disappointed. The cocktails were great -- I would get the Nahal '83 again, very light and refreshing. We had great service. The hummus was fantastic -- the salatim plate was great. Wish there was more pita that came with the meal.   I had to try the Sabih when I saw it on the menu. However, Fat Pasha's version was too stuffed. It used the same chopped egglant with tahini as on our Salatim plate -- when it really should be fried eggplant. It  also had apple and brussels sprouts. Nothing was mixed in the pita, it was just layers so you didn't get a variety of ingredients in each bite. The whole sandwich was just too mushy and overflowing. Wouldn't order it.  OVERALL THOUGHTS: -You should definitely go!  -Get the Salatim, and try the hummus. Skip the Sabih. -Nahal '83 cocktail was great."}
{"text":"Another welcome addition to the Dupont Strip and the ever-growing Anthony Rose empire. Everything this guy touches - along with his talented and knowledgeable staff - turns to gold. Inviting atmosphere, slightly more upscale and a tad more \"mature\" than his other two offerings. Your mother won't complain about the volume here. Also a bit more intimate, although shared seating dominates on the patio.   Food is tasty! Large portions are brought out in a hurry. I was one half a twosome and can see why this is an ideal destination for larger groups. That said, we shared one hummus plate, a seared tuna main, fried rice main and split desert. More than enough for two people.Probably OK for 3 if I'm being honest.   Price was fair, especially considering the quality of service received. Prompt, well trained staff - our server was equally interested in food, wine and beer and made some great recommendations - had us in and out in just over an hour. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Lemme start of by saying the low rating is not because of the food quality or service. Both of those are average. But honestly, this place is thievery. Maybe people who like this place aren't middle eastern or haven't been to a restaurant that serves this type of food because at this place, they think it's fine to serve you HUMMUS for $16!!!!!!!!! We asked for some hot sauce, and they charged us for a tiny bit. When we asked why, they let us know it's made with 12 intricate ingredients. Come on man we weren't born in rural Canada, we know you don't charge for hot sauce. The icing on the cake is when you ask for more pita, and they bring you 4 tiny triangle pieces and then charge you. Kabob for $31? Dawg.... that should never exceed $20, idc what meat quality you're using. Lamb kofta is two smaller than usual kofta with beans. Yes because beans are very pricey and worth $25.   To the manager, your food quality is fine. Just don't expect people from the region to buy into this prices. We know pita is worth 0.05 cents. I felt insulted lol."}
{"text":"I had a lovely dinner with my friends at Fat Pasha. We ordered the roasted cauliflower, a dish this restaurant is known for and it was amazing. We also had the hummus with poached egg, and the mixed fish platter which were very tasty. We were seated on the patio for dinner and it had a great atmosphere.  The servers were very friendly and service was timely. Overall,  I had a very good experience."}
{"text":"Went her with a good friend, because we had heard the reviews and excited to check out this place. To be honest, I think it's a lot of hype. We mainly ordered dips, with pita, such as hummus, eggplant dips, and lamb meatballs. The meatballs were good, but small portioned and the dips were nothing to really write home about. Also they gave us 8 pita slices each (2 whole mini pita) for 2 people and 5 dips, so of course I had to ask for more pita at an extra charge. I think this place is hyped a lot for its trendy looks, but the food is nothing special and I can probably get the same stuff at any persian place on Yonge in North York, for half the price, instead of going there."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and great service. I think brunch is the best meal to go for as the dinner is generally over priced for the proteins. I would recommend getting a bunch of salads and sharing a main. I love what Anthony Rose is doing for the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Pretty pathetic. Our tattooed sour server acted like we were bothering her by being there. It was a Sunday night and we spent a lot of money there and she was curt and unattentive and SOUR the whole time. Arriving at the door we stood there for a few minutes, with several tables free, and another employee (female bartender) said to be patient. Ok.  Food.   What the Frig? Cauliflower was hard (HARD!) in the middle and arrived in 10 minutes.   Falalfel- dry, felt like it ha dbeen made way earlie, not fresh at all. Bland. Dry. Ali Baba's is way better because I CAN SEE THEM COOK IT.  I'm not going to get into my issues with the other items we ordered. Our server wasn't kind. The food was phoned in (Sunday night syndrome?) and the Norman Hardie wine (usually a great producer) was very very warm and not worth what we paid. For god's sake, don't serve boiling hot red wine.  Guys. You can do so much better than this. Sadly I was at SWAN recently too and that was sub-par. Anthony you can do far better than this. You need to take a serious look at your staff. Weaksauce employees are not doing your food the justice it clearly deserves.  Note: This visit occurred 2 months ago in May 2016."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and my friend took me here. We sat outside on the lovely patio- we tried a trio of salads (all delicious!) the falafel- also very good but the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts, Halumi, pomegranite seeds was one the absolute best dishes I've had in a long time! (I'm not a vegetarian- but these were all veggie dishes)  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Feature cocktail was nice and the server was lovely.  Wish I could say the same for the food... Lamb was extremely salty, hummas bland and rapini super bitter. Definitely not worth the $100 I spent."}
{"text":"Overall, very flavourful and vegetarian happy food. I was reminded why I love hummus so much again. The sharing/family style format works nicely. The place itself is small and loud but cozy, and the staff are obviously professionals.   The cauliflower. It's $19... for 3/4 of a head. It comes with some pretty tasty  toppings, but if you know how to cook cauliflower properly at home (ie. roast it...) you won't be blown away.  Also, the halloumi was grated while I wanted to bite in to a chunk of that squeaky goodness (since isn't that the point of halloumi in the first place?).   Not sure if we would go back. Most of what we had we could likely make pretty well at home."}
{"text":"Don't go here. It's louder than a rock concert and totally lacking in sound attenuation.   It doesn't matter what the food is like. The waiter couldn't hear enough to take our order. We had to point on the menu.   Our friends? I don't know if we are friends any more... we couldn't hear.  We repeatedly asked for them to turn down the music. No action. Save your money."}
{"text":"Having had enough of the rave reviews from my well-travelled and well-fed friends, I decided to make the trip to Dupont to find out what the hype is all about. And boy, were my expectations blown out of the water. For appetizers, we had a trio of salad, with homemade labneh with za'atar, charred eggplant, and a delicious kale salad. The labneh is so addictive, my friends and I were fighting with our spoon to finish the remaining morsels. Next, we had the grilled squid which had turmeric kimchi and chickpea mayo - simply addictive.   At a modern fusion Jewish restaurant like Fat Pasha, one must always order at least one meat dish where we had the grilled lamb sirloin apricot and pistachio pesto, and delicious herbs. The roast cauliflower was the crown jewel of our meal with its fantastic garnish of pomegranate and halloumi a delicious cypriot cheese.   The portions at Fat Pasha are indeed generous but you may skip dessert as they were rather disappointing. With maple syrup and quite a lot of sugar, the sticky date cake and milk & honey pudding was an unhealthy nod to North America's sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Dishes are good but lack the flavour to give it 5 stars. The cauliflower also looks great, and tastes good but is overrated in my opinion. Or perhaps, they skimped out on the halloumi that night."}
{"text":"4/5! This is definitely one of the best middle eastern Restos in Toronto! I highly recommend the dips, cauliflower, hummus with lamb and bread pudding for dessert. The only dish I was disappointed with was the grilled lamb t-bone. Highly recommend trying this place in a group so you can try different dishes"}
{"text":"Checked out Fat Pasha for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The room itself is cozy and cool, small dining room as well as some high top tables around the bar. Reservations a must. The host and server we had were fantastic, passionate foodies who gave good direction on what to eat and drink. Between the two of us we shared the the hummus, lamb t-bone, chicken schnitzel, cauliflower and squash. Our eyes were clearly bigger than our stomachs as we couldn't eat it all. The cauliflower ($18) is huge, which we were warned, was very tasty and worth taking in a doggie bag. The mains were also delicious, lots of butter, and flavour so save this place for a cheat day!  Overall the food and service were great. Its a little on the steep end, $235 for two with a bottle of wine. Will for sure go back with a group to share and taste more dishes."}
{"text":"The food portion was not enough for an adult. The waitresses were rude. Though the patio was cozy. Considering the high price if you are going there to enjoy your food you have much better options."}
{"text":"It was great! We sat at the table next to the kitchen which was fantastic, right in the action. We had a party of 6 and made a reservation which was a great idea as it's always packed.   The service was super helpful and really nice. They accommodated all our parties crazy allergy requests and even assured us they would grab the freshest salatim so that it wasn't contaminated with nuts.   We ordered a ton of apps and then didn't even get to the main course because we were stuffed on all the hummus, falafel balls, salatim ect and they were incredible! The food was really top notch. It's got a lot of depth and flavor to it.   Only compliant is the drinks were very watered down and very small portions."}
{"text":"I admit my expectations weren't too high for Fat Pasha.   My friends were visiting and their colleague in England, a Toronto native, recommended this place to them. I had never heard of the restaurant, but after looking up the menu (pricey), the location (far from where I live) and the 3.5 star on Yelp with many complaints about the service, I have to say I wasn't too excited at the prospect of trekking to Bathurst and Dupont on a Sunday evening to check Fat Pasha out.  I was so pleasantly surprised. The food was like nothing I had ever had before! I loved the family-style sharing and the unique range of menu options, many of which I had never seen offered anywhere else in Toronto. The chicken wings were divine, as was the popular cauliflower, half of which was taken home for the next day's lunch. The hummus was so refreshingly light and balanced I could hardly believe it. There were so many flavours and textures within almost every dish we ordered (we ordered a lot between us!) that it was almost overwhelming. The latka platter, of salmon, caviar and sour cream was another favourite of mine, and even the pickle platter, which admittedly had the potential to be disastrous, went down a treat.  I have to say, I found the service was 100% excellent from start to finish. Our water was constantly refilled, and some excellent recommendations were made to us by the server. He also warned us when he thought we were ordering too much food for the three of us. Nice to see this kind of honesty!   We sat in the heated patio and it was a lovely, atmospheric way to spend the evening.  Would really recommend Fat Pasha for anyone hoping for a new culinary experience in Toronto. There's not many places like it."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. A friend had a birthday celebration at Pasha with a larger group. The party was forced to switch to a fixed price menu at $40 per person. For those like myself who did not want to come to eat but just for a drink with the birthday girl, had no choice but to pay the set fee. The restaurant is not a buffet style and should not force anyone to eat if they are not interested in the food.   I think this type of arrogant customer service says a lot about a business. The taste of  the food is irrelevant because this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, delicious, and full of delightful flavours. Staff was extremely gracious and friendly. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had wanted to try this restaurant for a while and finally had the chance for my birthday. Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and suggested we order three dishes. At first we though that was for each of us but he helped us when ordering to scale back to 4 dishes (cauliflower, lamb, 3 salatim and the kale salad) and then add a single latka so we could try it. It was a lot of food but it all kept well for leftovers. It is really helpful to have a server suggest the number of dishes and some good picks so that was great we knew we ordered a lot but the menu was full of delicious options. The lamb was perfectly cooked and delicious and the eggplant and beet salatim were favourites too. They gave us some extra pita to bring home with our leftovers which was a nice touch. In Toronto a lot of the tapas style restaurants have small portions for expensive dishes but Fat Pasha offers a good range of prices for large portions so you could go here for a regular dinner without spending a ton or splurge a bit if you want more variety or more meat dishes."}
{"text":"This place is actual heaven and quite possibly the best meal I've had in my life!  I went for dinner with a large group (20ppl) as a part of a work dinner and we were served their prix fix. For $45 per person (not including drinks) we were served a DIVINE 8 course meal. Each round was outstanding, and basically had a sampling of their menu. My only complaint was that by the 5th course, I could only have one bite for fear of exploding...I just couldn't miss out on trying everything though!"}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to try Fat Pasha because we love Rose & Sons so much (for those of you who don't know, they are owned by the same people). We will now add this restaurant to our rotation! We loved it.   The restaurant is small and cozy - you will want to make reservations ahead of time. The waiter was very attentive and helpful in explaining menu items, which was really appreciated as we had not heard of some of the foods before.   We ordered the Salatim to start with rapini tabouleh, beet root relish and eggplant tahina. The rapini was a little too bitter but I guess that's rapini for you. The beet root and eggplant were amazing!! We were pretty full even on the Salatim as the portions were quite decent. For my meal, I ordered the Za'atar fried chicken with potato salad - loved it! The chicken was so crispy and tasty that my partner couldn't help picking off my plate.   We had a great experience and will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Visited the newest of Anthony Rose's holy trinity of restaurants on Dupont tonight with two fellow diners. I've come to expect authentic and perfected cultural fare from Mr. Rose this far, so my expectations for Fat Pasha were heavily influenced by my experiences at both Rose & Sons and Big Crow respectively.   We ordered a carafe of Arak to start -- authentic liquor from the Middle East. If you're not a fan of the anise or black liquorice flavours, I'd skip this one.   Next 2 of us ordered the Fat Pasha Feast, which included the \"Salatim\" starter, hummus, tahini, and pita breads. Hummus and tahini were superb and authentic - some of the best in the city without a doubt!  The feast continued with a skewer of lamb, chicken liver, a beef kebab, shawarma with a few sides (fries, pickled veggies, and a couple sauces). Meat and sides were pretty good, but nothing that blew me or my fellow diners away. Shawarma was probably the best of the lot.   Portion was decent, certainly not as big or plentiful as the other two restaurants.   We also got the head of cauliflower -- tasty and simple. Also very much a decent but not memorable dish.   Service was attentive and friendly, although you should be very punctual as you'll be asked to leave promptly for the next reservation.   Overall a 7/10.   Granted the restaurant is brand spankin' new and like any new establishment deserves a grace period to figure everything out.   I would return but probably wouldn't go for the \"feast\" this time around.   Will definitely be back in a few months when this place is in full momentum.   \"B'hatzlacha\" (good luck!)"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Great service, excellent food and a fun slid back atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Concept is great. Food is disappointing. The cauliflower was upside down and cut into three weird pieces. The sauce on it was dry. The lamb can be classified best as average. The Latka were average at best. Too dry, overdone, and too much onion in it. I would have given it a 3 or 3.5/but for the price it is a bad deal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Like homemade but with more bells and whistles.  Let's talk about the cauliflower that all the reviews go on about.  Albeit pricey, it was most wonderful with layers of flavour heaped upon a frankly vitamin lacking vegetable. Crowning glory of toasted pine nuts and pomegranate seeds over the green yoghurt based sauce brought the whole dish together.  The hummus was creamy and pared well with the haloumi cheese and the eggplant schnitzel was good but standard.  My only suggestion is a tasters platter.  We could only handle three plates but I would like to have tried more.  Good for a special night out."}
{"text":"To be politically correct at the expense of the English language, this restaurant is menuistically challenged.  To the owner:  chum, there is a huge number of diabetic people in North America.  Check it out.  Your menu is virtually impossible for diabetics.  For vegetarians there is some relief, often by way of zaatar and other spicing, but the cauliflower is, sorry, boring; and the mixed mezes plate is not very mixed.  The big surprise came with the bill.  So glad I was already sitting down."}
{"text":"Fat Pasha is such a treat. The seating is rather cozy, but bursting with light, and the service is always impeccable here. I've been several times, and each time, the servers are always attentive, super friendly, well versed with the menu offerings, and always make sure that your glass is never less than half full.  This is one of my favourite places to grab lunch/brunch, and the quality of the food is really up there.  Their deep fried cauliflower was one of my favourite dishes, but I'm not sure if they have this anymore. My other two favourite items on the menu: hummus dips (try as many as you can!), and their fried chicken. Yes, the fried chicken here is really THAT good.  Tip: line ups can be really long, arrive early if you don't want a long wait!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives in the area and we thought that we would check out the restaurant after having walked past it several times. We didn't have reservation and ended up sitting outside. The waitress was a bit indifferent and gave us their confusing menu (who ever created this menu needs some UX training). Found it really bizarre that their sandwiches come with no sides and that you would have to pay 5 dollars to add french fries. We went with the brisket and falafel platter. The portions are meager. The worst part was that when you pay electronically, tip is automatically set at 20%. I'm sorry that but's a lot of tip for over priced food and lackluster service. I'd rather eat at Tabule (you are given more than one pita there). Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Fat Pasha was a fun brunch experience. A small place specializing in middle-eastern style Jewish cuisine mostly with a flash of the more common, North American type too.  My girlfriend and I order the full Salatim place, which included 7 salads. Two I loved: the squash and the beets. Both were sweet and went very well with the pita.  Two I found to be very good: the eggplant and the roasted tomatoes. Bother were savoury with a touch of garlic. The other three - tahini with everything spice, cream cheese, and mixed greens - were just ok. In fact I was not a huge fan of the cream cheese. All of the salads had a lot of oil. In some cases, like with the squash and the beets and the eggplant it was ok. Cream cheese covered in oil somehow wasn't a great combinations. But again, squash and beets were just excellent.  We also ordered the chopped liver. I liked this dish. Very rich, filled with a bunch of goodies like egg and fried onions and topped with chicken schmaltz (poured right at the table). It came with challah bread.    The service was very friendly too.  I thought that it was a bit pricey. The bill for the plate of salads and the chopped liver was, with tax and tip, a little more than $60 which is a bit too much for casual brunch.  Mind you I very much like a casual brunch, when paired with the correct pricing. In all, this place is probably $10-15 more expensive than it needs to be.  I will add one more point, not a negative but a good-to-know. Fat Pasha is a small place, so definitely make reservations ahead!"}
{"text":"I had their shakshuka and sufganiyot. The shakshuka was dissapointing. It doesn't really have a lot of those goody tomato goodness. I'd rather go to what a bagel for a good consistent shakshuka. The sufganiyot was as shown on pictures on yelp and taste quite predictable after seeing the picture. Service was lacking and horrible. Barely anyone pouring water. At the end, the manager fought with a pair of customer regarding tips/payment. She turned it into a big mess with lots of loud voice. I understand that the manager needs to do what she had to do, but I'd appreciate it if she didn't ruin my experience. She should have discussed it not in the dining room, if it's going to be a long loud fight with customers. There was only me and the pair eating there. So, I felt that my presence didn't even mattered to the manager. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"My first -and NOT my last - Sunday brunch at Fat Pasha!  I met a friend for a 2+ hour brunch. It was our first visit and we were very impressed. It was quite a trek for the both of us, but well worth it. The vibe is casual and the classic rock made us feel at home.  I think we ordered too much food, however, they were happy to pack up the leftovers so we could take them home.   We shared a load of things to test out the menu:  The Yukon Gold fries were possibly the best I've ever had in Toronto. They were served with a paprika mayonnaise which was interesting, but they were perfect on their own.  The Falafel were perfect and huge.  The Labneh was the best in town, served with plump pitas.  The 1/2 Roast cauliflower head was amazing.  Americanos were okay, however the Nutella Babka Bread Pudding was amazing.  I will definitely go back for dinner - soon!"}
{"text":"So so great. Went with a bunch of friends and a baby.  Service was first class - lots of great suggestions from the waitress.  Food was really flavorsome.  We ordered: .  Brussel sprouts (A+++) - maybe the best brussels I've ever had (and I eat a lot of brussels, it's really one of the best vegetables) .  The special of Fried chicken and latkes (A+++) - crispy breading, moist inside, great latkes all seasoned well .  The special of duck wings (B) - seasoned well but a pain to eat and a little dry . Salatim (chopped eggplant & tahini, garlic labneh w/ za'atar, matboucha w/ cranberry beans, tomato & smoked paprika) - (A) great dips, perfectly warm and soft pita, more than enough to go around.  .  Falafel (A++) - just incredible.  a perfect saltiness and a lot of greenery inside . Cheesecake (B) - standard but my friends loved it . Apple cake (A+++) - so cinnamony and sticky and delicious.  top job   Will absolutely go back"}
{"text":"Overall this place was okay - the schmaltz fried rice was really delicious and the roasted cauliflower was aesthetically pleasing with all the toppings.  That said though, while all the food was tasty - it surely did not blow me away, and considering the price - I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Such a gem! We went as a group of four for dinner and ordered a wide selection of the menu (three salatim - red lentil, labneh and eggplant, hummus, roast cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, kofta and lamb shawarma). This was more than enough food for four, we even took leftovers home. I have to say that my favourite things were the salatim, the hummus and the Brussel sprouts. I can't wait to go back in the summer and sit on their patio."}
{"text":"Ive stopped by this highly acclaimed middle estern hummus fabolous little spot for a quick bite. We order the hummus of the day; hummus with red pepper jam, feta cheese and greens.   The hummus was really good. Smooth and rich and flavours with great combination of sides.  We were looking at the menu previous to this order trying to combined as much as possible with this little snack. Unfortunately, fat pasha does not have sides options or add on to existing plate. As i am always looking to add protein to my meals, i wanted some chicken added tothe hummus plate but the only was to purchase a half chicken plate for 30 something dollars. And well. Obviously i didnt.  For food that is suppose to be share, the restaueant doesnt leave a lot of space to accomodate sharing. Bring your wallet."}
{"text":"Food is good quality and well prepared, but you will be disappointed if you expect it to taste like food you would get in Israel. Flavours and colours are not nearly as rich - shakshouka is very bland. Having said that, it's quite a nice place, pleasant service, and you will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 8/10  Went for lunch for the first time a few weeks ago and was not disappointed. We managed to grab a seat at the bar and quickly decided to share a couple plates so as not to fill up too much.   We had: - the 3 salad combo (garlic fried tomatoes, labneh evoo za'atar (which is a yogurt based dip), and chopped eggplant & tahini) - pasha plate with za'atar chicken  The salad trio was great. You definitely need to like dips, and those types of textures, but it was a great variety to go with the pita that came with it. The yogurt-based one was my favourite. It was light enough for lunch but was still extremely satisfying.   The chicken dish was also great. Accompanied by beets, some vegetables and pita, it was a well rounded dish that could definitely satisfy a lunch craving.   The interior was clean and focused on keeping the Middle Eastern theme alive. The staff were what you would expect - friendly, but nothing above and beyond.  The bottom line: if you like Middle Eastern food, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I can't figure out this place, I really want to like it. We came for brunch, and the menu is interesting and diverse. The service was good, and this small place was soon packed during brunch.   We started with the hummus which was decent, but the bread wasn't quite right.   For my main I got the smoked and cured, which had several smoked fish and other items. It was decent, but not great. Others at the table mostly got Shakshuka which looked awesome, I probably ordered wrong."}
{"text":"We came to try for fist time and it's SO good!! Everything it's delicious and the best attention ever. Recommendation: red lentel soup"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty great.  I think to really get the most out of it you have to go with  group, probably around 6 people is optimal.  The dishes are designed for sharing so it's not a great place for just 2 people."}
{"text":"A very unique and interesting take on middle eastern food. I came with one friend and we ended up ordering a ridiculous amount of food just to try a bunch of things. We had the classic middle eastern dips, hummus and labaneh, which were both very delicious. We also had the chopped liver and onions, which they mix at your table, and the rapini tabuleh to start. For mains we had the turkey shawarma and the flat iron steak with cauliflower on the side. The steak and the cauliflower were both very good but I found the shawarma to be a little bit plain.  The patio seating is very cool and makes it a great spot to take a date.  Having grown up in the Middle East my usual complaint about Middle Eastern food in Toronto is that it is overpriced but Fat Pasha was very unique and definitely worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Excellent Mezes and Lamb Chops. The much touted roasted cauliflower is good looking but falls short on flavour and softness. Service is very good and caring. The restaurant offers the worst martini in a tiny glass made with so called hand crafted Tito Vodka. The restaurant does not stock any other Vodka as an option. You can draw your conclusion as to why. Would I return to the restaurant ? Not for the value and its martini and the wine list. It is all hype. Suresh Chawla"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch numerous times. I show up just as they open, and have never had trouble getting a good seat. The service is great, and the cocktails are perfect. As for food I recommend the shakshouka with meatballs because this is the perfect mix of savoury and breakfasty."}
{"text":"What more can be said about this place? An easy choice if you're looking for rich, flavourful food that is good for the soul. A bit pricy, but worth it. Great for sharing!  Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Value: 3.5/5  We had: cauliflower, 5 salad dip, wurscht and eggs, and date cake dessert (very sweet)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. My boyfriend and I ordered the trio salatim, the famous cauliflower dish and my favorite the fish latkes. Everything was delicious and savoury. Prior to ordering our server said 3 dishes is enough for 2 people and I agree, the portions are big that we ended up taking half the cauliflower dish to go.  Pease take my advice and get reservations because we were put on a wait list and were told we would have to wait maximum 1 hour and a half and they would call us. We waited for at least 2 hours if not more. Whatever the food made up for it and was definitely worth the wait.  As for the service it was meh, we initially had a male server and waited for him to come back to take our order (as he said he would) but he didn't come back so we had to  tell another server (whom was available) that we were ready but she ignored us :/ we were confused but figured that she would tell our server to get our order. so once our actual server took our orders, he pretty much disappeared on us afterwards."}
{"text":"Lunch  The good stuff first: ambience.....beautiful and intimate space. Service is good, and they are trying to do middle eastern food a little differently.   Food: Was meh. We ordered Salatim (sweet potato, eggplant & beet root), hummus w/meatballs, cauliflower.  Final word: Don't really get the big deal about this place other than the fact that it serves middle eastern food in a nice setting in 'The Annex'. Tons of better options out there in terms of flavour profile and value   Fine dining: Byblos (Favorite of mine)  Casual dining: Anatolia (Favorite), Tabule, Tahkt-e-Tavoos (Favorite), Pomegrenate, Shomal  Diner style dining/Brunch/: Mashu Mashu, Sheherzade   Repeat: No"}
{"text":"I'd have given 4 stars - the food is worth that rating, but my issue was with the reservation booking and the hostess... we called for a table for 5 and were told that reservations were available at 6:00 or 9:30... so we chose the 6:00.  we were running a tiny bit late so i phoned the restaurant to tell them we'd be 10-15 minutes late and they said no problem.  we arrived before 6:15, (to a completely empty room except one table) and were told that because we were late they may need the table for the next booking so we may need to rush our meal a bit.  of course we took our time, and had a great meal (food was delish... lamb, cauliflower, short ribs, mix of salads... all great)... and during the entire meal there were an abundance of free tables, when we left at around 8:00 every table next to ours was still free... some of which could easily accomodate groups of 6.   So a) why only offer reservations at 6 or 9:30 when the place is not full and b) why put a bad taste in our mouths before we even sit down by telling us we may be rushed out the door, when your restaurant is NOT FULLY BOOKED???  Waitress was great... food was great... just that reservation/check in process put a damper on the evening."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Definitely come hungry because it's super filling! The cauliflower is a must, and surprisingly also the beets! The beef steak is mouthwatering but considering the price, it's WAY too tiny. My main complaint is that the server was quite rude to us when seating us because it was a busy night, but at the same time you shouldn't make customers who are paying you feel uncomfortable. Maybe she was having a bad day, I'd give the place another chance though."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked through the door I liked the energy of this place. When we were walked through the back to the patio I geeked out and turned to my friend and said so loud and excitedly \"this place is awesome\" - the hostess gave a little chuckle.   We were seated on the end of someone else's big bench table - which I always appreciate as friendly and engaging, and a demonstration that a place is not stuffy. The waiter helped us choose a glass of wine to our taste and from there the night continued to impress.   Delicious hummus and lamb skewers were enjoyed, but the cauliflower was the true winner - so good.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Had the mint cocktail which was barely more liquid then a shot of alcohol. The food is very good which made up for that. We had the daily hummus - very creamy and topped with the biggest asparagi I've ever seen. We got the famous roasted cauliflower which was grilled and topped with pomegranate and pine nuts. Absolutely unique and delicious. The lamb shawarma was so good but a bit dry. Luckily we added the remaining hummus to it which made for an incredible dish. A bit pricey ($25 for the cauliflower dish) overall but a great experience."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I always know that no matter who I am dining with, I can bring them here and have excellent service and food that is familiar but always a notch above. Great ambience and neighbourhood vibe."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Fat Pasha for a long time now ever since my gym friend raved about it.  First off I'd like to thank the staff again for accommodating adding a late addition of one more guest to our reservation.  They didn't have to do it but they did and we greatly appreciated it.  The food was delicious and good portions.  We started with hummus which was tasty.  Could use maybe two more pita slices.  We then had latkes, chicken schnitzel, 3 salad plate and the iconic cauliflower.  It was a lot of food for 3 people but we got to try all the great flavours!  I got so full and the people next to us had a nice looking dessert but we had no room :(. Next time!"}
{"text":"i had here one of the. best. cocktails i've had in my life - solid 5 stars for that. the AVANT GARDEN cocktail created by bartender Chelsea mixes gin with muddled cucumber & mint, vermouth, maraschino liqueur, bergamot syrup, and celery bitters. incredibly fresh! and most fitting to welcome a sunny spring-thank-god-you're-finally-here evening. smells delicious the entire time you're drinking it. i may not be exaggerating when i say i'd want it by the pitcher-full this summer...  the ZA'ATAR SOUR was not nearly as life changing but far better balanced in terms of sweetness/tartness than any whiskey/bourbon/rye sours i've had in the past. this one was made with bourbon and sprinkled with za'atar for some meatiness.   onto the food, we just wanted a few nibbles; 3 stars for the food:  the ROAST CAULIFLOWER is a beautiful creation - roasted whole head of cauliflower, drizzled with a cilantro-heavy sauce and tahini, sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and pine nuts, and halloumi cheese. really satisfying but undoubtedly pricey ($17) for what it is. taking this as inspiration in my own kitchen, yoink!  the LATKA PLATTER came as three well-crisped potato/onion latkes toped with cured salmon, shredded smoked fish, a slice of pickled hard boiled egg, sour cream, and salmon roe. i wish the caviar/dill each offered a stronger presence but the egg made up for their lack of flavour. altogether tasty nonetheless.   i'd want to return for the cocktail, of course, and with more people to try lots of the salatim/dips. hummus would always be satisfying for me but i am skeptical of how it can get to be worth the $$..."}
{"text":"Doubt I'll ever go back here!  While the food is good, everything else about the restaurant is dreadful. Calling it \"loud\" doesn't even come close!  Both my friend and I had eaten at the former occupant, Indian Rice Factory, and cannot understand what possessed the owners of Fat Pasha to change the once-quiet spot into this din-ridden den. We were particularly appalled at the loud, shrieking young women sitting in the window near us. Guess they didn't get the benefit of a good upbringing and learning consideration for others. Yet the signs suggest they are the demographic Fat Pasha wants to cater to. My advice: if your evening plans involve going to the nearby Tarragon Theatre, skip this place and turn to old reliables like Bistro Tournesol or Fanny Chadwick's."}
{"text":"Very expensive for a casual spot with half of a roasted cauliflower at $18, a full cauliflower for $29, wings for $22 and 4 slices of breaded eggplant at $22. Too creamy and saucy for my personal taste. Disappointing.  Middle Eastern or Jewish food is usually delicious,healthy and not overdone. This was the opposite. Save your money and ignore the hype."}
{"text":"Overall: Fantastic! Would like to visit again!  The only thing I found difficult about this place is the volume level.  The place is loud enough as customer chatter bounces off the walls and ceiling,  They add in loud music, I guess, for the vibe.  Less is more, people! I like to be able to chat more easily with people at my table.  Granted, I only came with my wife.  They recommend 3 dishes for 2 people, as they are built for sharing.  We followed that, and their recommendations.  1. Hummus Our server said it was the best hummus she's ever had.  It's very good, could be best for me as well.  We had the one with the lamb, and it's a bit spicy for my wife, which meant perfect for me.  2. Fattoush This is a nice salad.  It's served in sections, and tossed tableside.  Yup, they toss the salad in front of you! ;)  Nice flavours, my wife commented how it's so hard to find a salad that's actually good, but this is one of them.  3. Roasted cauliflower I can't believe I had a $19 cauliflower, but I did.  This dish is large and has many components to it.  Delicious!  4. Dessert (does not count towards the 3 dishes!) - Sufganiyot These are like beignets or unstuffed profiteroles.  The texture was perfect as the shell was crispy and the inside was soft.  Add in the whipped cream, strawberries & sauce... Mmmm... I added a bit of all 3 to the doughnut insides, and it's a perfect combination.  Cocktails were nice too.  Different from anything I've had."}
{"text":"Can't stop thinking about our weekend brunch at Fat Pasha. Come here if you're looking for an atypical meal - Jewish food with Turkish and Mediterranean flare.   Oh and come here with a raging appetite because the portion sizes require you to unleash that second stomach you never knew you had.   We ordered the following for two (had two meals of leftovers!):   Shakshuka ($14): sweet and hot pepper tomato poached eggs, sweet peas, grateful bread challah and added lamb meatballs (+$6). This dish is served on a sizzling hot skillet. The eggs are perfectly poached and immersed in the melted tomato sauce. You can eat it straight from the skillet or dipped with the pita bread. The lamb meat balls were what we expected, gamey balls of meat -I wouldn't say they make or break the dish, but a good addition if you're looking to add more protein.  This dish reminds me of the Fried Egg and Tomato \"Cho J?dàn\" staple of Northern Chinese Cuisine.   Brisket Pasha Plate ($16) - Served with pita, tabule, tahini, and pickles. The brisket was tender and flaky. The tabule and tahini made great side additions to the dish.  If you order a pasha plate and a salatim, you can opt to exclude the tabule and tahini choices from the salatim (if you're debating between which salatim dishes to order).   Salatim ($32) - Seven sharing plates of dips and salads with charred pita. They were all delish, I've noted my three favourites with asterisks (*).   1. Rapini tabuleh  2. Beet root relish* 3. Butternut squash, sumac*   4. Labneh evoo za'atar  5. Tahini, everything bagel spice 6. Garlic fried tomates 7. Chopped eggplant and tahini*   French Press Coffee (~$10) - Fresh, servers about 3 cups of coffee.   The weekend brunch hour gets busy, I recommend calling in for a reservation. I generally like to be seated at the bar if there is one, that way I can watch the magic behind the preparation of the drinks. In particular during brunch hours, you'll be concealed in the aromatic scents of the French press and espresso maker.  Also, water service is always on point when you're near a server.   Overall:   Food: (10/10) - Food was made with fresh ingredients and marinated with a fantastic melody of spices. You do pay the cost for fresh ingredients, be prepared to spend a hefty dollar dining here.   Atmosphere: (10/10) -Bright, clean, and bustling brunch scene.   Service (8/10) - Food takes longer than usual to be served. At times a bit hard to wave down a server (even when seated at the bar).   Bring deep pockets and eat here."}
{"text":"This was a somewhat planned trip though we had to play it by the ear as the reservations were only available for later hours.  We were seated at the patio even though the main area was completely empty (it did look somewhat busy but wasn't full when we left). The patio is decent and felt nice on a breezy evening.  First off the beer list is OK and could use an improvement. On to the main attraction the food has some decent offerings and should cover most dietary restrictions. The appetizers somehow look more interesting then the mains so wanting to try a bit of everything we decided to go with the salatim with 5 options and picked up everything except beet and egg plant offering (was ordering an egg plant main). This platter comes with a side of bread and was quite good. Lost of flavor and refreshing tastes here. I particularly enjoyed the peppers and tahini. The cauliflower comes recommended so will try it on the next visit for sure.  For main we had the roasted chicken and egg plant schnitzel.  The chicken is OK and somehow I enjoyed the tahini and heirloom tomatoes more than the meat. The egg plant was somehow on the cold side. Its not pleasant to have fried food on the cold side as it started to settle in stomach real quick. We couldn't even finish it. Again the toppings were quite good. I think I will revisit based on the apps alone and may order a whole bunch of those next visit instead as the mains didn't impress.  3 stars P.S. The music choice at the patio is different from the dinning area inside (Hey Fat pasha the 80's called they want their ungapatchka music back)"}
{"text":"Disappointing and over priced. Hummus was served hot and oily  (microvaved?). Famous baked cauliflower not on menu but ordered \"summer squash \" as twin substitute.  Turned out to be 3 green and yellow zucchini with gooey haloum cheese, pesto, pomegranate seeds and pine nuts. Again extra pricey. Food very salty. Better stick to tried and true middle east restaurants with tried and true cuisine."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for sometime and safe to say I was not disappointed. I would have to suggest going with at least 4 people to be able to sample the menu correctly. And, sharing is caring right? If you have a soft romance with Brussel Sprouts you need to go! Amazing. Obviously had to try the Roast Cauliflower but it wasn't the star of the show much to our surprise and had the same feelings towards the Falafel. I think the Salatim is a smart move. We ordered 3/$18 but would do the 5/$29. Tahini and everything bagel spice, chopped eggplant and tahini and red lentil spread and Moroccan spices were all really nice. Daily Hummus is a must! And you could always throw some shishito peppers in there for some fun! Honestly you can't go wrong! Great for the gram! Small restaurant, laid back vibes, very cozy."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one to ruin the party, but my experience at Fat Pasha did leave somethings to be desired.  Tldr; I'd go back, but only because the competition for this niche is low in the downtown core.  Had a reservation for 8 pm on a Tuesday, for 6 of us, that I booked about 6 weeks in advance.  When we got there, they casually said, \"Sit at the bar,\" without really giving us an idea of how long the wait would be (we got there at our reservation time, 8 pm).  We stood around awkwardly at the bar for thirty minutes.  While this might not be a long wait time if a) you don't have a reservation b) it's a weekend or c) if the staff is super apologetic, this ending up being 25% of our entire time spent at this restaurant, and that's just too long if you've made reservations.  At the very least, comp us a round of drinks or give us a dessert at the end to apologize for not apologizing.  Once we did sit down, in a very crowded space, we realized two things that would remain true the entire meal: the place is boiling hot, and very loud.  We could hear each other, but it's definitely not a \"romantic\" feel.  My friend said we should let the server just decide what to bring us, and I said, jokingly, \"Well, she'll just tell us to get the platter they have then,\" and indeed, when we asked her to just bring out things she thought we'd like, she said, \"Just get the platter.\"  When it was clear her imagination didn't extend past this concept, I myself said, \"We'll get the vegetarian dip platter, tahini, falafel, fattoush, hummus and chicken liver.\"  When we ordered the cauliflower, she never said they have half orders or full, and just automatically brought the full size, which was way too much for a group our size.  Even when we told her that none of us ate lamb, she still was guiding us towards the meat platter, saying we just shouldn't eat the lamb from it...it was clear we were hoping to go a vegetarian route that night.  In general, the service felt very lackadaisical and uncaring, like the servers job was to be a food runner and that was it.  The food, I must say, was good.  Nice flavours, good portions.  No extremely \"wrong\" orders made.  Especially with no competition for middle eastern food downtown (unless you count fast food), this really fills a much needed space.  In that regard, I would go back - there's only so many places to get fattoush when you need it.    The bathroom stalls were so small you couldn't even crouch, and I'm 5'3\".  Drinks were interesting, not sure if in a good way or a bad way -- definitely different than anything else I've ever tried.  Complimented the food well.  Hopefully they get some a/c in the summer."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern restaurant in Toronto with friendly service. Ordered the shakshuka with beef, highly recommend it. Will visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"My eyes were bigger than my stomach, but just. Come hungry and bring friends.  That cauliflower is a whole head of cauliflower that will make you wonder, how come I never knew cauliflower was so good ? Sadly, I don't think this one is possible to duplicate at home. I would suggest it's worth the trip to that otherwise strangely bereft strip of Dupont just to try the cauliflower.  That was my favourite, but everything was good. A little disappointed to find the hummus wasn't more special. I mean, you call it the fat pasha hummus and you've got my expectations up. I think this one could be just called hummus.  I would like to give a half star more because the interior of the place is really cool and unexpected , but then maybe I'd take it back for being too noisy to have a conversation (at lunch) and having bathroom lighting that made me want a seeing eye dog.  Then I'd give the half star back because one of their featured cocktails had Pimm's in it and it's not a bloated fruit salady Pimm's cup.  I'd do a boot camp workout and then come again."}
{"text":"WOW! Fat Pasha is insanely good!!!  I came in on a Wednesday evening at 7:30. Glad I made a reservation because it was PACKED. The restaurant isn't huge and the tables are pretty close together, but my dinner was quite enjoyable. In fact, I was impressed with how low the noise level was despite the amount of people in the room.   Service was prompt, food was delicious!  We had: Roasted cauliflower - 5/5 seasoned to perfection!  Cornish hen - 5/5 large portion. About 8 or 10 pieces. Very tasty   Squash salad - 5/5 this is like a squash dip. It is amazing  Hummus - 5/5  Eggplant dip- 5/5  I came with a friend, but this was enough food for 3 people. The portions were very generous, the prices were reasonable. A group of 4 could easily eat here for less than $200.   I highly recommend Fat Pasha.  I can't wait to come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"So good! Came in for brunch at 12:30 with a friend, and was seated right away. This place has a hipster feel without the bad service. The portion sizes are super generous, they definitely don't skimp out here! Although the roasted cauliflower is a unique concept / dish, I couldn't justify the price ($20) and will not be getting it again. Thanks yelpers for a great recommendation!"}
{"text":"Excellent Israeli food. Mind-blowing falafel! The vibe is very relaxed, but it does get a bit hot and stuffy inside. I suggest sitting on their patio outside, weather permitting of course. Service was very friendly, and of course the food was delicious!   Highly suggest sharing various plates, especially the hummus, falafel, fried crushed potatoes, muhammara, tahini, and the list goes on!  The sufganiyot are a must for dessert!  The only disappointment on the menu for me was the shakshuka. The israeli cheesecake was a bit too sweet for my taste as well but overall, excellent experience."}
{"text":"This may be one of my favourite brunches in the city.   I'm down for some gravlax 'n' toast. I appreciate having the shakshuka with halloumi and za'atar foccaccia on the menu  Am I craving something decadent and sweet? There's nothing like house-made doughnuts. Fat Pasha has the Israeli-style jelly doughnut, sufganiyot, with sour cream icing and maple mint strawberries.   You can't go too wrong with fresh pita and a selection of salatim, such as the chopped eggplant & tahina, rapini tabuleh or labneh.  The experience is enhanced if you are sitting on the lovely patio out back."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow!  From the quaint location, to the decor, to the staff and the food, Fat Pasha exceeded all expectations.  We came for an early dinner, when they reopened at 5 and were nicely greeted and shown to our seats.  The decor gives off a nice rustic ambiance, and the small restaurant gives the whole dining experience a warm and comforting experience.  Our waitress Florence was great, directing us to their signature dishes and explaining how the portions work.  We ordered the kale salad, lamb shanks with truffled brussel sprouts, 1/2 chicken and signature hummus.  Neither one dish was overly salty or overbearing.  The kale salad is to die for (did I just say that?)!! The mix of crunchy and salty and sweet just satisfied my taste buds to the next level. Chicken was tender, not dried out, and huge portioned.  The hummus with lightly toasted pita bread was delectable... A great creamy texture, with thickness.  We were very satisfied with everything.  Prices are a bit on the higher side, but it is well worth every penny!"}
{"text":"First, I do not give 5 stars, unless I see a completely flawless restaurant. But Fat Pasha gets a well deserved 4 stars for the following reasons:  Decor:  I love the small quaint, rustic look, from the hardwood flooring to the retro chairs and table.  It is a small but very busy place.  Better reserve ahead of time.  The liquor shelves, open kitchen and marble bar countertop brings a modern fused with a old style, for my tastes, I like it.  You will not feel out of place with casual wear, staff and customers dressed in jeans , shorts and t-shirt.  But the only flaw is that it does get a bit noisy and an irritating mosquito was buzzing around.  Service:  The staff is very friendly and mostly female., not a bad thing.  The maître d and wait staff was attentive and very knowledgable on what is best for table of 2.  The wait staff recommended certain platters and served them with army like timing and precision, paced when to deliver each platter.  Food:  Started off great with a glass of Cantine fontezoppa verdicchio white wine, perfect for a meal at Fat Pasha.  First platter was 5 salads which a vegan would enjoy.  5 for $25 (beet root relish & dukkah, tzatziki & sumac, cranberry matboucha with bagel spice, garlic fried tomatoes and best chopped eggplant & tahini).   Next was the grilled squid in mint sauce, squid cooked to perfection but perhaps a bit minty taste but still good.  Finally the best for last was the Latka platter consisting of pastrami Salmon, smoked fish, with sour cream and caviar given with pita bread.  Finally dessert, I selected the \"sufganiyot\" (3 donuts with cream custard and jello jelly). Delicious.  My friend had the Nutella babka bread pudding which also sampled and did not disappoint.  Price: For a company of two, everything including 20% tip came below $140, not the cheapest but both myself and my friend were full and cleaned our plates I have been previously to Byblos and food wise very similar in tastes and would recommend both but you do not like dressing up then reserve a place at Fat Pasha!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and lots of flavor! Fantastic for anyone who likes middle eastern food. Try their version of fried chicken!! It's awesome :)"}
{"text":"Great unique food, big portions, cute cozy patio. Reasonable prices and for vegetarians there are lots of options. Salatim platter is a great deal and the roasted cauliflower is a must try. Would have given a higher rating if it wasn't for the terrible waitress with an attitude. Seemed almost annoyed to have to be there, maybe have a talk to staff about their customer service skills....."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Fat Pasha but....I just didn't. The back patio is gorgeous, great service, nice drink options, all of that was positive. I just wish the food was better. We shared falafel, three of the salads, cauliflower, and lamb. I didn't think that the falafel was anything special, tasted fine but honestly how much can you do with falafel? It was good value, 8 fairly large falafels for $10. The salads were my favourite part - 2/3 of them were delicious - the tahini and the labneh. The rapini one did not work for me - I like bitterness, but that's all I could taste, the other flavours were not balanced very well. It needed some other textures/sweetness in there to make it more edible. I hesitated before ordering the cauliflower as I generally don't like ordering 'hyped' dishes, but decided to anyhow (mainly out of curiosity), and it was disappointing. Really heavy, too savoury, each bite felt like an ordeal. I think they could lessen up on all the sauces on it, add more pomegranate seeds so that it tastes a little more fresh. Honestly, it made me feel sick halfway through. Similar experience with the lamb and beans - granted I was pretty full at this point but it also just felt really heavy. The meat was cooked nicely, and it was tender, but the beans/shallot/sauces again made it too intense. My stomach hurt when I got home :/   I wouldn't make a point to go back, but if I did, I'd definitely try ordering some of the seemingly lighter dishes as maybe the combination we had was just not the right fit."}
{"text":"I like the salad !! It tasted so good.  I went there with BF on Sunday for lunch. We had few dishes. Sweet potato with egg(sauce was interesting), salad(both BF and me like it a lot), beef sandwich, donuts with vanilla cream+jelly ( I was surprised to see BF ate dessert and told me it tasted good) Like the dessert too!!!!   The service is good there (= waitress was very thoughtful. Whenever she told us some recommendations, she always pointed out on both of the 2 menus (BF's and Mine). We will come back. (="}
{"text":"This place is awesome for sharing.  We went with another couple and had a little sample of everything.  We especially loved the roasted cauliflower and the different dips.  It was a little light on the pita to dip ratio though.  Service was excellent and we definitely were there lingering and catching up a long time and we should have left to accommodate the clearly growing numbers of people waiting for our table, but our waiter didn't even seem to push us out which was nice.  The only negative is the price of the alcohol - sky high... stick to beer, the cheapest bottle of wine is 49 dollars, yikes!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Fat Pasha just a few days after a great dinner at Byblos so I was really looking forward to having what promised to be another great middle eastern dinner and I did not leave disapointed! I'm not going to compare the two except say that Fat Pasha does have a more intimate and cozy setting than the more elegantly laid out Byblos, they are both excellent and it would be tough to recommend one over the other.   I was seated at the bar type seating which didn't allow for the greatest table space of all but it was still enough to enjoy the meal. We ordered the roast califlower,grilled squid and quite a bit of hummus, and everything was amazing! I  highly recommend them all, perhaps the cauliflower would take the spot as the must try from that lot?  It was extremely busy, we had to wait for close to an hour, which was spent drinking at a pub near by, but the food was worth the wait! Hopefully I get a proper table as oppose to the bar type sitting the next time so I would have more room to spread out the food.   Overall, one of the better meals I've had in the city!"}
{"text":"Yelpers all raved the cauliflower dish so we ordered it, hoping to finally embrace this humble pale vegetable.  When the dish came, it was an uncut piece of cauliflower, a giant steak knife stabbed in the middle of it all, perceiving the man power needed to cut your own share of the vegetable. It was covered with vivid green sauce, and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and nuts. The presentation was as inviting as an empty streetcar.   I have nothing bad to write home about. We left full with a belly full of delicious food and the service was excellent. But at the end of the day, you realized that a cauliflower dish priced at $18 is quite a triumph for a restaurant."}
{"text":"great spot. unique atmosphere. great liver. good spot to share food."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here on a whim.  If you think I'm critical about food! She's especially picky, but she ended up loving the place and I suspect will come back for more.  On a Thursday evening, the place was booked and we were lucky enough to snag a spot at the high top bar table. Reservations definitely recommended here.   The vibe is pretty vibrant with large windows of natural light pouring in. People are in here of all ages, staff is friendly and not pretentious.  . Food is excellent. Middle Eastern, but mostly Israeli but with a bit of a twist. I loved the menu fonts looking like Hebrew, it itself is a work of art.   We ate enough for at least 3 to 4 people. Portions are quite large and sharing is a must.   We started off with the platter of salads and dips that came with pita. It was great to have a taste of everything including homemade baba ganoush and pickled carrots. It's a bit pricey at $22 but could be shared amongst 3 to 4 people.   Then we shared the grilled chicken thighs. So succulent and juicy while being crisp on the inside. My mom was impressed. It came with 4 pieces and we should really have stopped there.   But we saw the roasted cauliflower and we couldn't pass it up. You can get a half head or full! But half head could be shared amongst 3 to 4 people as well. For 2 people it's really heavy almost like a meal in itself. It's unique and worth getting once.   Then dessert. I really wanted to try each one of them. We got the Shaniyot (what I thought would be jelly donut, and instead a homemade custard fritter. Still amazing)  and the Nutella Bread Pudding. If u had to choose one, I'd go with the bread pudding.   I waddled out of the restaurant with bags of take home, wondering when the next time I'd come back again. Makes me also want to give Rose.and sons another try (same owners)"}
{"text":"This unique brunch experience. Most places just have eggs and pancakes and whatnot but this place has a beautiful roasted cauliflower that was simply delicious! I highly recommend it if you are looking for an unique experience"}
{"text":"Fat Pasha has my favourite shakshouka in the city (I have probably tried it in 10-15 restaurants)!  It comes out in a sizzling skillet and is perfectly spiced, including zatar.  I also recommend trying the cauliflowers (although slightly less brunch-friendly) and the hummus.  Last time I had brunch, they had a hummus special with veggie fritters that sort of tasted like falafel but less deep-fried.  I also really appreciate that they take reservations so you can avoid a lengthy wait out the door like some of the other establishments in the area.  If you come on a warm day, the patio is amazing.  My one piece of feedback would be to get some version of dairy free milk.  I am shocked they don't have it especially as a restaurant geared towards providing a Jewish dining experience."}
{"text":"Delicious. We ordered: classic hummus, roasted cauliflower (must order), sweet potato for brunch. Good amount of food for 2 people.   Try to sit in the patio - it's nice and quaint. Small though so make reservations ahead for sure in the summer time."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying this restaurant for sometime. Made a reservation for 12:30 today - glad we made the reservation.... very very busy little restaurant.   We both ordered Beaus Lug Draft Beer, very nice and refreshing !   We ordered the Fried Chicken drizzled with Honey and Za'atar accompanied by a potato salad which was really really good.   Large plate of food with 2 big chicken breasts (boneless) - great for sharing !   And we ordered the full Salatim which had a beet salad (chopped) - very nice. Eggplant...yummy but a little to chunky for me, tomato salad - it was just ok, sliced carrots cooked with spices - very nice, tabouli made with rapini - not to my taste either a little too bitter, the last salad I'm not sure what it was - squash maybe - again - Meh ?? it all came with pita which was warm and they were very light and fluffy.   A great lunch, but I think I'd only order the Salatim if there were more than 5 of us and only order specific ones.   Service was impeccable !!   Desserts looked really good but we didn't order one - maybe next time.   2016 Challenge - 1st time here."}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian and Fat Pasha's dishes could turn me into one. The roasted cauliflower and fatoush salad is to die for. We ordered aprox. 6-8 dishes to share among us and each one was delicious- so much flavour, including dessert which I am not usually a dessert person. The service was the best you can get. Can't wait to head back to try the rest of the menu! So full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Service is great, they are friendly and patient.  Food tastes just fine.The slalatim is great but the roast cauliflower isn't that good. It's just quite Instagrammable so almost every table ordered it. On the menu it says market price??? What market price do you have for a cauliflower??? It's 25 dollars for us that day and I still can't believe we spent 25 dollars on a cauliflower We barely finished it  Would go back again though, they have a nice patio and summer in Toronto is too precious to have"}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to this place for a long long time, and it did not disappoint. I definitely recommend getting either the hummus or the dips (get the fried tomato!!!!), so you could get something else! It's a lot of pita for one meal between two. The Beef Kofta is definitely a favourite. A bit spicy too!   The spicy cocktail was ok. It was only the salt rim that was spicy. I could have passed on that. Nothing too special.   The service was ok. Maybe it was just our server. They were able to put up our jackets when we first arrived which impressed us at first, but didn't bother to ask if I wanted another drink after I was done the first. Also, I don't remember the server having much presence. Some people may like that, but I like having a full experience.   The bartender was knowledgeable though. When she came by to drop off our drinks, she overheard me say, \"I'll ask our server later\" and she insisted I asked her instead. She gave a great recommendation on which main to get."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday and found that the place was packed when we got there. The host had asked us if we didn't mind waiting for about an hour. I asked them to see if they can call their other restaurants such as Rose and Sons, etc. to see if they can accommodate us. The host (sorry, forgot his name) was gracious enough to call and find out but it was the same waiting time. We decided to stay and wait. Fortunately, the bar opened opened up with 2 spots within a few minutes and we got seated. Stroke of luck!  The food was amazing and the portions are definitely healthy. We had the falafel, lamb shank, saffron couscous and the roasted cauliflower. The cauliflower are a must try! If you're unfamiliar with this type of food, the servers are definitely more than happy to help. They got a great collection of booze prominently displayed behind the bar. The servers are very attentive and friendly. The place has a very intimate and relaxed ambience and did not have an air of pretentiousness.  Overall, I would definitely come back to this place and highly recommend it to anyone who has not been."}
{"text":"We turn to Jewish and Middle Eastern cuisine when we're craving rich, full dishes that sing with exotic and exciting flavour combinations; but it's not always easy to find the really good stuff. And, because we've been lucky enough to have eaten a lot of food from around the world it can be hard to delight our imaginations - and our palates. Fat Pasha certainly checked off all these boxes for us.   AMBIANCE:  It's a great place to gather with a group of friends. With an intimate feel (seating allows for about 40 people), the lively buzz in the room picks up quickly. It has a modern, clean feel with blonde woods. Walls and accents in whites and subdued blues. The tables are bit close, so it isn't an ideal spot for a romantic date night or private conversation. But it's a great spot when you need a dose of social energy to pair with your big meal!  SERVICE:  The staff are lovely and attentive but can get caught up in the energy of the place, so you might have to be a bit assertive in getting their attention when the place is full.   Our waitress was casual and straightforward with an easy-going air; her vibe suited the social atmosphere of the place.  FOOD:  We feel their menu is best enjoyed with a group of 4 - 6 or more. The dishes are intended for sharing, and some are quite large and hearty. Their famous roasted cauliflower alone would have been enough to contentedly feed two people.  The three of us had ordered four dishes and were ready to lapse into a food coma by the end of our meal! We probably would have been quite content with three dishes, and a shared a dessert.  Dishes come out one at a time, with a bit of space between each to let the rich food settle and make it easier to keep going.  Hummus: We started with the hummus - hard not to! They have a daily hummus special with a creative twist and a unique collection of toppings.  This was perhaps the most decadent version we've ever had;   super creamy, with whole chickpeas on top, pickled onions, parsley, tomatillo \"salsa\" and paprika - and of course lots of EVOO.  It was delicious and has encouraged us to be more creative with our hummus at home!  Roasted Cauliflower: This is one of their most famous dishes, and when we saw the neighboring table dig in, it just had to happen. Tahini (made from sesame seed) and skhug (a cilantro and garlic based sauce), is layered over top.  Pomegranate seeds and pine nuts are sprinkled on top with some grated halloumi. It's really, really filling (did we mention that it's filling?) with lots of flavours complimenting and contrasting each other - we loved it!  Duck Schmaltz Latkes - Latkes are a \"pancake\" made out of grated potato. They're cooked in duck schmaltz, which is rendered duck fat.  A version of schmaltz is used in many cultures and allows food fried in it to achieve a beautiful brown crispness. These latkes were nice and thick, with a crunchy exterior and a soft, tasty interior.  Served with applesauce and sour cream these were a real comfort food for us.  Chicken Kabab - Big cubes of chicken breast in a lovely yogurt-based sauce and a side of delicious, sectioned tomatoes and drizzled with dill and parsley.  Thank goodness this was a smaller dish, as by this point we were near the point of bursting.  We were a bit uncertain about chicken breast as a kabab; when not done just right chicken kababs can come out dry.  We needn't have worried; the chicken was moist and delicious - they did a fabulous job."}
{"text":"Get the cauliflower!  The cauliflower definitely lived up to the hype and made eating here worth the mission! The blend of tahina, skhug, pine nuts, pomegranate & halloumi was so delectable, and made for a very unique dish. We also ordered a series of dips, which were all very delicious.   We came here for dinner and ate on the patio. The ambiance and service was great. The decor of the patio felt very welcoming, with spacious communal style tables and strings of outdoor patio lights. I didn't want to leave!   Overall verdict: Great food and great hospitality here, solid 5/5."}
{"text":"TLDR; fantastic service, good food. Would definitely eat here again. Great for big group reservations.  Went here for brunch, we were almost an hour late for our reservation because the Santa Claus parade caused very length detours. The host held our table for us and was very gracious.  We shared a bunch of appetizers and each ordered a main course. Food was great."}
{"text":"Perfect. Cauliflower and pomegranate and hummus. And you're set for the night or life. There's standard stuff people get when they go to a restaurant. Calamari, chicken fingers, pizza... That stuff is familiar and probably won't kill you and you get it because you know it. But order the weirdest sounding stuff that you're faking like you know what it is here. Because it will taste so good. And you'll love it and pretend like you know it after. Roast cauliflower. Saffron couscous. Lamb shank. Three dishes. Totally amazing flavors. Loved it."}
{"text":"Such a nice place for brunch! Been a couple of times on Sundays around 1pm and there was never a line and was seated right away. Service has always been good and attentive.   Gotta get the dips/salatim platters, 3 for $18, its not the cheapest but is delicious. My favs are the garlic labneh (super garlic, creamy and cool I can eat a whole plate of this, probably the best labneh around!) red lentil spread (yellow in color but lots of spices and nice smooth bean texture) and the garlic fried tomatoes for some texture and freshness. Served with warm pitas, its satisfying and lots of flavors. The hummus with lamb kofta meatballs were good, but not as good as the platter.   The roasted cauliflower is also on the pricier side almost $20 but is pretty good, lots of toppings, sauces and pomegranate, its quite the flavor and texture party. The falafel were crispy and bright green on the inside, really filling and perfectly made.   Lastly the shakshuka, eggs poached in a tomatoy, red pepper, oniony stew. Pretty good but didn't blow my mind but really warm and tasted comforting. Can't wait to sit out on the patio here!"}
{"text":"Would I go back? Definately. Fusion twist on Shawarma shop staples- fattoush salad, tabbouleh with arugula, hummus with lamb. Everything was fresh, and the fusion elements made sense.   Sitting outdoors eating pretty , wholesome food with girlfriends and wine and arak = perfect night."}
{"text":"Good service. The fried chicken & Fatoosh Salad was super yummy, but we found the cauliflower overrated and covered with too much stuff.  We also found that our dinner was very expensive ($95 +tip for 2) for the quality of food."}
{"text":"We went for a private function. The group, of about 35, arrived at 7pm, most of us were hungry. Appetizers came out, falafel, pickles, warm pita, tomato salad etc. We were all happy and it was tasty, very tasty. We were all enjoying drinks then we were asked to sit down so the mains could be served. It was all family style and the dishes just kept coming. I won't go into the detail but I believe every dish on the menu was served. By the time the last dish, before dessert, came out, chicken, NOBODY, could eat anymore. Now I know it is traditional for Jews to cook a lot for their guests, as my grandmother used to say, ess, ess, you look like a bird, this was overdoing it. The food was amazing, not one dish we ate was bad but all the leftovers were packed up and there were 10 full paper grocery bags for guests to take. So a word of warning, great place to have a party, but be careful what they recommend for food. On a good note the back patio was amazing, the bartender was superb and we had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Yeah - great addition to the Dupont strip!  Took me a little while to visit, partly wanting to let them get the new restaurant kinks out of the way (see my original Rose & Sons review).  We stopped by after a walk on a Sunday evening and were lucky to get a spot outside despite not having a reso.  The place was jumping at 8:30 on a Sunday eve with a diverse and interesting neighbourhood crowd.  The staff is just as we have come to expect from this team - hipster - tattoos required, but no edge, in fact very helpful and easy going.  Full disclosure - Middle Eastern is my favourite, so I am biased towards their entire menu - it has lots of options for my taste - we had the Fat Pasha Hummus, falafell, fatoush, califlower & pickles - a great veggie meal, though my husband was dying to try the Kabab & the pastrami - so that will be next.  Everything was delish and we had enough to bring home.  I also loved the Spritzers - great for those non drinking meals both the grape & lemon were great.  Part of a great trend of creative, vibrant and original spots along the Dupont corridor (three from this same group!) - I am a huge fan and I recommend you check it out soon, especially while you can have the full patio experience.  PS - Had mixed feelings about the closure of the Indian Rice factory - on one hand it was the early option for Indian before the city got so many amazing authentic Indian places, but on the other, it was over priced and tired, so fat pasha breathes new life which was much needed!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  Not at all what I was expecting.  I suppose I thought that there'd be 60ish Jewish people enjoying Israeli specialties.  I was looking forward (at 51) to being the youngest person in the place.  I was the oldest.  A super young and friendly crowd and a very lively atmosphere.  Good thing I made a reservation because the place was jam packed.  Like everyone else I enjoyed the roasted cauliflower.  The fried chicken was out of this world--some of the best I've ever had.  I visited on a Saturday at noon so I only had the much reduced brunch menu to choose from.  I'll have to come back for dinner.  Service was excellent--super efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Here's another Anthony Rose restaurant on Dupont, and one that comes as a pleasant surprise as I didn't know what I was getting myself into past the obnoxious two layers of curtains fronting the entrance. It's pricey a bit, and a bit--just a bit--bigger than Rose and Sons (roomy enough to not feel like an overcrowded bus), but still, dinner reservations is a good idea.  Aside from the gentrified roasted cauliflower this establishment is famous in town for (and arguably famous also for making the cauliflower so hip recently it hurts the wallet), Fat Pasha serves up a hip take on Jewish and Middle Eastern food. Most of the food are meant to be shared amongst your party, but they're certainly not tapas portions. I enjoyed the falafels, but you can get that anywhere here in town so...  Here's what I'd rather you go for: the Fat Pasha Hummus ($10), and bloody hell sakes get it with the chili kale and pickled raisins (+$5). There's so much wonderful flavours of every sort and dimension in this hit, you'd skip the bread. The saffron couscous ($17) is another good choice that surprised me with a buildup of spicy heat with each bite.  The staff were generally courteous and explained the menu game, and we were able to make decisions that turned out to be accurate in terms of stomach-filling proportions. But you know what I was really was taken by here? The awesome funky tile patterns in the washrooms.  {TTC: a brief walk west from Dupont subway station}"}
{"text":"It will come as no surprise to anyone that I enjoyed me meal. The whole roasted cauliflower was good (not great), but I don't think I'd order it again. Everything else was phenomenal.   But it's not just a good meal that draws me to write this review.  Service makes or break a meal. And our service (by the woman with the septum piercing - I feel awful I don't remember her name) was out of this world. Best I've had in the last two years. She was engaging without being intrusive, attentive, caring, and helpful. The most memorable thing about my visit.  I was dehydrated from exercises, so was only drinking water. A lot of water. But my glass was never empty. My companion ended up getting a migraine, eventually requiring that we take our meal to go. And the server was authentically concerned.  tl;dr: I highly recommend this place for service alone, but the food is fantastic too."}
{"text":"Everything about our dinning experience was perfect! I recommend this place highly.  A true tantalizing experience for the taste buds. Just go! But not without a reservation."}
{"text":"I don't think i have had anything bad on the menu. Everything tastes great, and tastes Fresh!   From the spreads, hummus, cauliflower and falafal. It is all very delicious. I have also never been when it is really busy, which is good because I can get a seat right away.   Highly recommended to go to this place"}
{"text":"Pretty good food with great looking presentation! Fav was the cod and the fried rice. Lots of different flavours in the food. We didn't like the dessert as much. Thought the bread pudding had too many different flavours in it - sour, sweet, and more?? Nice staff and very busy on a sat night"}
{"text":"Super duper ! AWESOME brisket, cauliflower, cocktails, hummus, fattush, staff, restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I have had two amazing meals here - I love it.  Be sure to get the cauliflower dish and the rice dish.  Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to Fat Pasha three or four times now and I am always impressed.   Brunch - the shuckshuka is amazing, but very big. It could definitely be split. The addition of lamb meatballs were good, but you'd be fine without them as well.  Dinner - everything on this menu is amazing. Their different specials, like their latke special in the winter, are always worth trying. There is truly an option for everyone. I have eaten here with vegetarians and meat eaters alike and each person I eat with at Fat Pasha leaves raving about the place. Highlights include latkes, salatim, hummus, liver, and the roasted cauliflower (when it is on the menu.)  Ambiance - the indoor part of the restaurant is really nice, but the patio is AMAZING. They have heaters outside in case it gets cold.   Pro tips: 1. Make reservations in advance, as they fill up quickly and I have never been able to get in as a walk in despite trying several times.  2. If you don't order at least a trio of salatim, you aren't doing Fat Pasha right.  3. Tucked around the back by the patio is Schmaltz Appetizing, which is owned by the same owner despite being a different restaurant. Go there and pick up some things to take home with you even if you are also bringing home leftovers."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The falafel was outstanding. Fried to perfection with a great crunch. The matzo ball soup was one of the best ever! It was a special, and indeed it was special. Enjoy the fried chicken, you can't go wrong. He place is, small so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Fat Pasha. I feel like Fat Pashita. Food coma is coming. So full. Really good! Okay so why the three stars? Because you are better than for me to embellish with a 4th. The roasted cauliflower. Boom. Do it. It is a giant garlicky mountain you will dream about and wake up pissy because it's not there for a morning cuddle.   The Fattoush salad is not authentic. As a fattoush enthusiast, I was disappointed. Kale? Really? The humble Romaine has purpose and it is right here. Take your trendy kale elsewhere. Make a green juice.  Anyway, the menu is made to share. Fun!  Beet root salad, yum. Rapini salad, yum.   Light fare is none at Fat Pasha but you won't care. Trust."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite restaurants - I only give this four stars because it can be crowded and hard to go last minute (need to make reservation in advanced). The food is phenomenal - I love the cauliflower, the hummus, and everything I've tried."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance--the decor--the music and food selections--all in all a cozy good time. My husband and I made the mistake of eating breakfast (since we were hungry) and could only order so much while we were here. That being said, we tried the cauliflower, the hummus with lamb meatballs, pickles, tea, and some wine. Loved the lamb meatballs and the wine selection--unfortunately the cauliflower was not as flavorful as I had wanted it to be. I've been spoiled by having some amazing cauliflower dishes, but I think there was a little too much going on with the cauliflower and not all the flavors complimented each other. I did like the haloumi cheese cubes on it though :)"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. Basically pushed out with out of town guests to make room for the next wave after having been there just an hour. Food good but there are too many other restaurants in Toronto to justify returning here."}
{"text":"Fat Pasha has some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had. Recently came for a dinner with some girlfriends, so we ordered a bunch of things to share.   We started off with their hummus of the day, which was so creamy and smooth. The pita bread they served with it was still hot from the oven! The outside was still crispy and the inside was soft and airy. An amazing start to the meal.   Next, we had the beef brisket which was so flavourful and was soft and tender and pretty much melts in your mouth.   We got the roasted cauliflower because it's one of their most popular dishes, and were pretty surprised with how big it was when it arrived at our table! The cauliflower was beautifully roasted, so that you can taste actual flavour of the vegetable, despite being coated with all the delicious sauces. The pomegranate seeds that top it add a nice bit of freshness to the dish.  The latkes of the day were also delicious. The latkes themselves were fried to perfection, without the greasy feeling that some other places have. It still felt very light. Each latke was then topped with some yogurt, pickled vegetables, caviar and dill. Each element complemented each other very well, so there was a nice mix of flavours and textures with each bite.  We finished the meal with some sufganiyot (an Israeli doughnut). Again, despite being deep fried, they still felt very light. The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and airy. Topped with some powdered sugar for sweetness, and it's a winning dessert.   All in all, a delicious meal, and I'm definitely coming back with more friends!"}
{"text":"Fat Pasha is a good option for something a bit different on the Dupont strip.  I had the falafel appetizer. For 9$ it is one of the better values on the menu. The falafel balls are delicious and plenty for two people to share as an appetizer.  For the main course I had the chicken plate. The plate tastes healthy and delicious, though if you don't like the bitterness of broccolini, tread lightly on the green salad on the plate. Plates are all 14-16 dollars.  All in all, this is a good meal. The service here is great, and the quality is there. The only snag here is that you will pay more for what is essentially quality food truck food. An appetizer, main, and non-alcoholic beverage runs 30$ out the door."}
{"text":"All-around it's a good, not great, place for a meal.  Appetizer: Latke double-down--two latkes over crispy, fried chicken. Served with a pepperchini and hot sauce. Great crunch to the fried chicken and overall a very good option. 9/10 score.  Mains: Trout--good, nothing mind blowing. 7/10 score Hummus--very good, served warm. would recommend. 8/10 score Chicken wings--not good at all. Do not try. 3/10 score  7/10 for the final score."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at Fat Pasha last night. We had an 8 PM reservation. The food was good - I highly recommend the hummus, sweet pea fried rice and roasted cauliflower. We had the brisket which was okay, a bit dry. The server recommended the tuna, which we should have ordered instead. The one thing I didn't like was that it as obvious the servers were really trying to hurry us out. When you're out spending $200 on dinner to enjoy a Friday night, the last thing I want is my dinner to be rushed. I've had years working in the service industry and this is a big no no. I left with a bad taste in my mouth and unsure if I'll go back. I want to enjoy my meals, not feel like I'm holding up someone's table the whole time."}
{"text":"No joke. Truly living up to their expectation. Not just another hype. Amazing food and services. Def one of the top from TO"}
{"text":"Amazing experience here.   Really hip chefs and staff.  Great drinks.  The cauliflower app is unreal, perfectly cooked.  Steak was delicious  The patio had great ambiance.  Slightly over priced but I was still thoroughly satisfied."}
{"text":"This is for take out review just now. I've ordered before for lunch and dinner. Nobody picked up the phone within 15 mins, called 4 x"}
{"text":"Overall, just good. We shared a bunch of food, including the lamb, pate, a few sides, and of course the cauliflower. All very okay. Didn't live up to my hopes.   My favourites were the lamb and cauliflower though, which were done well."}
{"text":"I had a nice dinner with a friend at Fat Pasha last night. The food was all good, fresh, and interesting, although I didn't find anything particularly outstanding (update - the Israeli cheesecake is outstanding!!). That doesn't mean it wasn't all great though! Prices are a bit high for what you get with some items and it's quite loud (update - which makes it the perfect place to take a baby). Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!  We had some pre-dinner cocktails which were great (I recommend the Butter scotch one!) Roasted cauliflower is a MUST off this menu! As a vegetarian there was t. Shortage of dishes to chose from!  Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Been here twice! The Salatim platter is worth it - great variety to start. The latkes with smoked salmon and capers are a must! So delicious!!! I didn't think the liver was that great. I've also tried the shakshouka which was good and the shawarma platter but please do yourself a favour and try something new here. You can get shawarma anywhere but those latkes..."}
{"text":"I went here about a year ago with my father for lunch. The food took a while to be served, the food wasn't too unique but it was fresh. We got the appetizer deal where you get like 5 different plates to share and all I could remember is it was really expensive and we haven't even ordered a main course yet. In general I would come to this restaurant if you haven't tried middle eastern food and want to dabble a little with it."}
{"text":"It was far from our hotel but well worth the trip. We loved their food and the staff was so nice. The menu is not your every day same old stuff. There is something for everyone here"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place ! Middle Eastern taken up a notch ! Everything is fantastic here ! The cauliflower and fried potatoes are my personal favourites ! Great staff, service, etc. I can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Excellent food and vibe at Fat Pasha. Came here for dinner and had Salatim (we picked 3), Grilled squid and the Roasted Cauliflower (favourite!). I found all the food full of flavours and very tasty. We also enjoyed a cocktail each which were also unique. Service was fine and the atmosphere was great. A pretty diverse crowd was in during the night we were ranging from dates, group of friends, families and seniors. I found the food somewhat pricey."}
{"text":"I have to say that I had high hopes for Fat Pasha. I had been dying to go for years but the opportunity just never came up. Anyway, I stopped in with a friend for lunch on a Friday. The service was good and I liked the presentation of the mint tea. I really enjoyed the pickles and olives. My friend really liked the potatoes. I ordered the turkey shawarma hummus and she had the falafel. Both were served with skhug, which I thought was supposed to be a flavourful cilantro hot sauce. It was anything but. The turkey and the lamb schmaltz were good. The hummus was also on the bland side. My friend said the best part of her falafel was the coleslaw. Anyway, there was some good and some not so good. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I really don't have anything negative to say about this place. In short; great food, excellent service and a nice decor. We walked in without a res and they were able to accommodate us (although I would recommend a reservation in the future). We ordered the following and all three items were delicious:  fattoush - chopped israeli salad w/ za'atar pita chips, halloumi  12oz lamb kebab - charred corn & okra, tamarind sauce butternut squash & shiitake rice - preserved lemon, chili, toasted almonds  I would definitely recommend Fat pasha and would not think twice about going back."}
{"text":"This one-of-a-kind Dupont Street gem features Jewish soul food with a serene Middle Eastern ambiance. Start with a plate of falafel and keep eating. From the latke platter to the roasted cauliflower dish, Fat Pasha's one-page menu strikes a fine balance of texture and taste featuring Israeli and Sephardic cuisine.   Fat Pasha is an ideal restaurant for special occasions and intimate celebrations: graduations, engagement parties and wedding anniversaries to name a few. The dress code at Fat Pasha is casual dress; you are welcome to wear your shiny new heals or mucked up converse sneakers.   The fattoush salad is a great way to begin your culinary journey at Fat Pasha. Chopped greens infused with za'atar pita chips, halloumi, robust olives, chunks of cheese, juicy goji berries and other crunchy in-season vegetables make it zesty, hearty, satisfying to the taste buds and an overall gastronomical delight.   The staff at Fat Pasha are warm, friendly and accommodating, even for last minute drop-ins during rush hour around 5 pm when the restaurant opens for its dinner crowd. Although reservations are recommended most nights of the week as evenings get busy here, Fat Pasha's small team of upbeat yet professional servers will do their best to seat you and immediately make you feel as if dining there was the best decision you've made all week."}
{"text":"Walked here on a Sunday for brunch around 11:30AM - it wasn't too busy so got seated quite fast. Despite it being quite a hot day - my friend and I decided to sit outside in their back patio (very cute set up with wooden tables and greens - the only flaw being metal chairs which burned a little under the sun). Our table was right beside the koi fish pond (our waiter let us feed the fish before we left, after we kindly asked a few times :).  We took a while to decide what to order, and our waiter was very patient with us. He also offered a few suggestions - pointing out the most popular items and items which are not served at dinner. After a fair bit of stalking on Instagram, we finally decided on our orders - the smoked fish on bread challah (surprising light with smoked salmon and sour cream, and some addictive pickled onions), the falafel sandwich (huge falafel balls, purple cabbage and chopped salad exploding out of the pita bread - I had to eat it with cutlery but thought everything tasted great), and 3 dips (beet root, sweet potato, and our favourite eggplant) to share. We were a bit too ambitious, and I had to take a bit of my sandwich to go. Overall, we were satisfied with the flavours and size of our orders.  The only complaint I have about our experience was that halfway through our meal, it started to get super hot and we were burning/melting after the sun. We were thinking of rushing to finish our meal so we can leave - but eventually they put out their foldable roof. It became much cooler and more pleasant under the shade, so we stayed for a bit longer to actually enjoy the remaining of our meal."}
{"text":"Best hummus I've ever had!  Cauliflower was also amazing. Chicken wings were a bit spicy for me, but my spice level is pretty low. The rice with peas and almonds was delicious. Service was great!"}
{"text":"We had really good food yesterday night. We ordered the hummus with lamb meatballs, really good falafels, for main the lamb sirloin, cauliflower, and perch.   But... terrible service from the moment we got in. Our long night of waiting for rotating servers started. After a lonnnnggg wait some one came and we thankfully ordered our whole menu/drinks for the night. The appetizers came in pretty fast. But then again another excruciating long wait for ANY one to come by our table. A server got us the wine menu again but never actually followed up to see what we wanted to order :(. Finally our dinner came 2 out of 3 and after waiting  another period of time we asked about our last order which apparently was coming out soon. All in all good food just ruined by terrible service :("}
{"text":"Really great service and a beautiful patio. The menu is lovely. Should have brought more people though. The items are all really big so sharing between two we ordered too much.  Falafel was great and we got three of the tips. The eggplant one and creamy garlic ones were the favs. Also tried the shakshuka. It was okay but I wanted more sauce and softer eggs with it. Really nice flavour but it felt like mostly big chunks of onion. Really wanted to try the cauliflower but apparently it was a whole head so it seemed like a bit much for just two of us. I will be back! And with more people next time haha"}
{"text":"Finally went here! And didn't get the cauliflower... oops? They have an amazing salad in the appetizers and their Kofta is TO DIE FOR. If you don't like spicy do not get it. It is quite spicy. Good thing we got the beet root and mint to mild out the kofta.   Surprisingly good coffee here too! The only thing I didn't like was the server was a little sassy and the bathroom was way too tiny which is why I'm only giving 4 stars.   Otherwise a super great experience!"}
{"text":"Another addition from Rose & Crown family. Excellent Israeli fusion menu with some exceptional dishes like the cauliflower.   The space is intimate and really cute patio.  My last visit, there was an excellent hostess/server - in all my years of going out, I've never had such excellent service. She was just something else. Myself and my friend were both just taken back for a second."}
{"text":"Great service.  Terrific food.  Menu is difficult to decipher without help from a server."}
{"text":"Food was pretty descent but wanted to have a nice date and was squeezed into a communal table, meant for 6 but seated as 8 with total strangers. Hey Anthony rose!! @fatpasha I know you're trying to make fast cash on our money but if I'm going to spend over 100$ on dinner have the decency to allow your guests some breathing room!"}
{"text":"My former coworker had suggested this restaurant to me.  The food was an explosion of flavors, can't wait to go back.   Highly recommend the Akron squash.  Line ups are crazy!"}
{"text":"this is an AMAZING PLACE  If you like middle eastern falafel shawarma salad  type food BUT want a sit down nice meal that goes beyond this THIS IS THE  PLACE !! delicious food from appetizers to mains and salads  just look at the pictures on yelp and come to eat  the place has an inside that's cozy and friendly  and the patio on the spring and summer is great !  tip!!! next door is schmaltz appetizers which have your fix of schmaltz filled bagel sandwich in foil just as in new york  around dupont and davenport near casa loma  fantastic !!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars ... it's a solid place for brunch especially if you can sit on the patio.  I have to say the patio was so nice!  Being a Torontonian, summer sun is something I horde and want to use everyone minute without looking like a lobster.  Finding a gorgeous vibrant patio that lets you feel the warmth while still offering some coverage, PLEASE!  Love the wooden beams that hold all the greens and hanging lights.  We arrived here for brunch and the patio was definitely chosen over the dining room.  I wouldn't say it was overly busy but it is a popular local spot.  Service here is pretty good ... they know the food well and can describe it in detail.  It is pleasant and they do check in things are well... sometimes you have to wave them down but its not like they disappear for hours.    The food is quite instagrammable ... vibrant shades and colours just slick with a nice glean of olive oil.  None of it was bad really... except for the unwanted hair stuck in the dessert. I'll give credit to Fat Pasha for handling it well.  They took the offending dish away and offered a replacement and didn't charge for either one.   I will admit that I totally get the angst about the tiny offering of pita bread for the huge platter and then being charged for more.  You do get small offering of small pitas (yes small on small) for it and it would have been better to have been given more.  We had about half left of the salatim after generously using the dips on the pita AND falafel.  It does feel a bit penny pinching from the restaurant.    Pickle plate - A tangy start to the meal and we've been having some great ones lately.  Fat Pasha offering is a nice visual with the beets offering a colour pop.  It is on the small side especially when most other pickle plates have been the size for half the price. All the pickles seem to use the same brine so each vegetable is not uniquely flavoured with its own spices in the brine.  Unless you have a pickle lover and could possibly drink the brine, I'd recommend another starter.  3/5  Falafel - My search for the best falafel was tested here and these were quite good!  Nice crunch with the most vivid green softer interior.  The spices are subdued to the ones I'm used to but it is very good to eat with the muhammara dip (the spicier pepper one).  4/5  Salatim (5) - Instagrammable dish right here!  Just gorgeous with a lot of vivid colours.  There are 7 items you can choose and we chose the muhammara, tahini, chopped eggplant, garlic tomato, and beet relish.  Some of these are a bit better than others.  The muhammara is the star... great spice and flavour to make the falafel and pita so enjoyable to eat.  The garlic tomato and beet relish would be my next choices.  Both had good flavour and enjoyable to eat.  The tahini was super creamy and very rich.  I was expecting more sesame flavour but still a nice creamy option even though it was light on flavour.  The chopped eggplant was the least favourite... I think they didnt salt it to draw out the excess water so it was quite bitter.  3.5/5  Ice Cream Cinnamon Bun Sandwich - It looks so good... another instagram worthy dish.  Unfortunately we didnt get to take more than a half bite before discovering a blacky curly hair in it.  Yeaaaaaaah.  Kudos to the service for quickly remedying the problem.   2/5  Chocolate Crepe with Sour Cherries - This was recommended as their daily special that is supposedly very delicious.  I unfortunately didnt enjoy it.  We should have gotten the donuts instead.  The crepe was not cooked to hold up against the chocolate mousse inside and was very soft and wet sponge-like.  The chocolate seemed to be a bitter chocolate and have a weird chalky after taste.  Though the green basil leaves added a nice visual contrast, it was roughly chopped in large pieces and made for a very distracting unwanted herbal note.  Usually great with sweet strawberries in moderation ... not good in large amounts with a bitter chocolate and soggy crepe.  2/5  It could be a great spot but there's enough misses that makes me believe that there's still a lot to be tweaked to get a 4 star.  Its definitely possible for them to get it but not quite yet for me."}
{"text":"This is my first encounter to Jewish and middle eastern food and this place is awesome! I love the interesting cocktails! And the chopped liver & onions is probably the most memorable dish. I definitely recommend reservations be made in advance as this place is fully seated almost every night with its intimate ambience.The servers were friendly, smiley and efficient too. I really don't have anything to complain or negative to say. Ooo, maybe I do.. This place is a little pricey, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Not my favourite of Mr. Rose's restaurants. Which is unusual. Cool looking spot, interesting dishes. Neat idea. If you want to taste something unique check this place out. The food itself isn't unbelievable, it's heathy and bland. You get what you would expect knowing what is in the dish."}
{"text":"This place is best described as Me Va Me but double the price and half the portions. We made reservations and had dinner here in the first month it opened. We shared the Latka platter, roasted cauliflower, grilled squid and a 1/2 chicken that was their daily special. I didn't find anything particularly interesting about the food. Service was good and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"everything was good.  The cauliflower is unreal, the trout, the hummus, the falafels.  Everything is good"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their specialty house made hummus, the grilled calamari (so fresh!), the fried chicken, the loaded cauliflower, the falafel and the lamb shawarma.   I think any of the hummus flavors will be amazing. I tried the hummus of the day. It comes in a big portion (on a sizeable plate) and it's topped with heaps of Swiss chard and chick peas. At the top is some tzatziki. Too bad there's only limited pita bread to dip into the hummus (because you will get charged if you get refills) because the pita bread was soft and fluffy, very chewy, love it!  I love calamari and their grilled calamari is comparable to other places I enjoy calamari at. The calamari was chewy but tender, not rubbery at all. It was cooked just right. Add on the tomatoes in one bite, the taste is divine. Too bad there's no olives on the side. Would really compliment this dish!   I didn't try the fried chicken and the loaded cauliflower but from the looks at other tables, both dishes looked good. And if there's so many tables asking for these dishes, they must be really good too.   The falafel was one of the best I've had. Big in size, crunchy on the outside, soft in the inside and can I say I absolutely love the bright green color inside. Just makes me happy looking at the falafel.   The lamb shawarma is good for those lamb eaters. I'm not a huge lamb fan but this dish was acceptable. Taste wasn't too gamy but I'd say it was on the drier side. I wish they had more tzatziki sauce on the size or some hummus spread so it brings in some more flavor to the wrap. I like the sweet mandarins, chopped parsley and pickled radishes as the garnish though!   Oh by the way, try their Israeli cheesecake! Very creamy and doesn't feel heavy at all like the typical cheesecake.   LAST TIP?!  I suggest you sit in their patio because it's nice in the summer time to lounge there. It's secluded too so you won't hear the busy cars and buses on the road. It's also very pretty with the lights hanging on top and the great music playing in the background!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was ok. Took a while to be seated while standing at the door despite reservation. The main reason for the three is our waitress Natalya forgot to put in our order for the cauliflower. When we asked about it at the very end of the meal - after all the mains- she lied and said the kitchen was backed up due to the patio. We then saw her walk to the cash, put in the new order and then waited for it to be made from scratch after we had finished everything else. Customers are not stupid. If she'd just apologized, it would not have not been an issue. Probably won't go back because of her."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Rose & Sons (post here), I just can't wait any longer to try out Anthony Rose's latest venture, the much buzzed about Fat Pasha (@fatpasha).  I am so glad that Toronto seems to be on a Mediterranean / Middle East trend right now, bringing sophistication to the once cheap eats of $5 Shawarma. Aren't we all a bit tired of tacos?!  Reservation is available both online and by phone and I have been able to grab a 5pm Saturday reservation just 2 days prior. I sure am glad to have made a reservation since the place fill up in no time and saw quite some people with no reservation got turned away.  Love the menu design but it can be confusing but our waiter was there to answer any questions we may have.  Pistachio Sour $13 ~ Rye, Sherry, Lemon, Pistachio Orgeat, Albumen, Apricot ~ Sweet, nutty and way less sour than expected; it was a very well balance drink that I have been able to sip through the entire meal  Lavedula $9 ~ Gin, Lemon, Lavender Syrup, Mint ~ Love the tartness of this drink and appreciate that the lavender is very very subtle here (hate the feeling of eating/drinking potpourri)    Daily Salatim $22 ~ Spicy Carrot Salad, Garlic Fried Tomatoes, Rapini Tabuleh, Beet Root Relish, Dill Cucumbers, Chopped Eggplant & Tahini w/ Holy Land Pita ~ After seeing pictures of this online and I just had to order it, just look at the amazing colors. ~ Trust me, it's definitely a salad that's worth the price tag and it was quite filling that this could be easily shared between 4 people.  ~ Love everything here but my fave have to be the creamy delicious beet root relish and the eggplant tahini in the middle which was prefect with the pita.  Chopped Liver ala Sammies Roumanian $16 ~ Schmaltz, Gribenes, Onions, Radish, Egg, Grateful Bread Challah ~ Tossed table side with a warm schmaltz (aka clarified chicken fat).  ~ Although it was not the best looking dish, it was amazing. Love the chunky chopped liver here w/ the creamy egg, crunchy gribenes (chicken skin cracklings) and the toasted challah bread.  ~ This was another huge portion for a appetizers for 2, with 2 toast each this basically filled me up for the night... nonetheless, it didn't prevent us from cleaning the plate  Roast Cauliflower Head $12 for half ~ Tahini, Pinenut, Pomegranate & Halloumi (full head for $18) ~ Cauliflower being one of the top food trend these days, I have personally been making them at home all the time and seeing this on the menu, I just had to order it.  ~ Since it was just the 2 of us, we only order 1/2 a head and yes it tasted just as colorful as it look.  ~ Never though of stuffing cauliflower with pomegranate to roast but the result was amazing, love the warm pop of sweet juices with the earthy pine nuts and the saltiness from the Halloumi.  Latka Platter $22 ~ Pastrami Salmon, Smoked Fish, Sour Cream, Caviar ~ Love the lightly smoked fish, hate the over salty overly cooked smoked fish most of the time but this was just perfect. ~ Love the latka (potato pancakes) with the hot sauce and even better when topped with the caviar and sour cream, definitely the way I like it.   Nutella Bread Pudding $9 ~ topped with Shreaded Halva & Ice Cream ~ Somehow I expected their dessert to be on the sweet side but this wasn't sweet at all.  ~ Love the dense moist custardy nutella bread pudding with just a touch of honey syrup on the side.  ~ Served warm, it was perfect with the sour tahini ice cream, the crunch of the halves macadamia and sweet nutty flavor of the halva.  Verdict : ~Have you been to Fat Pasha yet?! If not, you better make a reservation right away ~Will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu ~ Amazing food & service"}
{"text":"This place is unreal. The classic hummus is beyond delicious, the lamb is beautiful and the roasted cauliflower is amazing. I'm sure everything on the menu is equally as impressive but that's all we had. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to Fat Pasha 2 times.  First visit:  My first experience was pretty decent. We ordered the chopped liver, falafel, the duck comfit hummus. The duck comfit hummus was amazing, the falafel was crunchy on the outside and fresh and soft inside. The copped liver was a good experience, but not quite my cup of tea. Overall, my first experience  was good.  Second Visit: I had some guests from out of town which wanted to try Fat Pasha so off we go for the second visit to Fat Pasha. During my second time visiting the restaurant there were some changes in the menu.The duck comfit Hummus was gone and replaced with the Truffle Hummus. We ordered some salads which was really nice. The falafel was again really delicious.   Truffle Hummus sounded really exciting, Truffle and Hummus? who doesnt like that. Getting really excited about the Truffle Hummus, we ordered one. the description of the Truffle hummus on the menu was exactly the following. \"Truffle Hummus-poached duck egg, black truffle. So we were expecting a hummus with poached duck egg and shaved black truffle. When the hummus came it was a total disappointment. On contrary the expectations built reading the menu, the hummus only contained the \"soul of the black truffle\", which i mean there were no black truffle on the hummus. Afterwards when I asked the waitress about the truffle situation. She explained that they infuse olive oil with black truffle and use the infused oil when making the hummus. So a total sham, when it writes black truffles on the description of the meal you expect actual black truffles.   Fat Pasha, perceived as one of the best restaurants of last year. I think its a big bubble, where you dont get the service that is promised. Will not be visiting this place again"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food at this cosy annex spot. Try a variety of dips with pita, and of course the roasted cauliflower!!!"}
{"text":"Cauliflower was a little over hyped in my opinion - lacked enough flavor, the tahini is too bland to fuel an entire head. The Salatin with beet relish was delicious!!! Pita was great too. Overall good presentation."}
