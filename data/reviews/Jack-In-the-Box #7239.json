{"text":"Ok guys, this is a fast food joint! So rating it like its red lobster isn't fair. They are always clean, there's good parking, and I haven't experienced long wait times.....but again..... it is fast food, so if you go at 12pm then c'mon!!!!!! I gave it 4 stars because the order does come out different at times, but the ratio is great."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Jack in the Box I've ever been to. Does not matter if the restaurant is empty  because they always take 20min for your order. The employees were extremely rude because an older couple asked a question about the price that the cashier could not answer so she replied with \"I don't care, tommorow is my last day\". They were older and it was a simple question that if she did not know the answer too she could have simply asked someone else. Sucks that they are across the street from my house."}
{"text":"Having transacted some business at the Kohl's just west of there, I found myself hungry, and popped into this Jack-in-the-Box for a quick snack.  An Ultimate Sausage Sandwich from their breakfast manu set me up nicely.  Ordered some tacos without sauce to take home to the lovely Orchid.

Food quality: Good.  (I am enough of a realist to understand that I'll never find five-star food in a fast food joint.)
Menu options: Excellent.  The ability to get their entire menu 24 hours a day puts them light-years ahead of their McCompetition.
Service: Very good.  My order was confirmed bedore it was rung up, and the cook double-checked the order before it was completed, just to make sure.
Personality: Excellent.  Friendly, smiling folks who actually look like they like what they're doing, and care enough to do it right.

I may have to head in this direction more often.  Thank you.

{"text":"Great customer service for a fast food place. 2 employees for the early morning shift. The front/ drive thru employee handling both counter and drive thru. Very nice apologizing every minute for the wait. We didn't wait long at all. Food was good, fresh made. Very good experience at Jack in the box."}
{"text":"4 stars compared to other fast food and other Jack in the Box locations. They present your food in a little better fashion if you are a dine-in customer. Tacos look gross but are cheap and taste good for the price. Stuffed jalape√±os are just as good as anywhere else, but a little pricey for a fast food location. Mini churros were a mistake, not the greatest but they are a cheap dessert option and were edible."}
{"text":"No complaints- it is your typical J in the B with lots of options and specials. Friendly service, although the drive thru was pretty slow. I sampled my fries before I left and mentioned they were a little cold, so they gave me some fresh, hot fries and didn't want the old ones back. They never have a problem giving you extra sauces or anything like that, either."}
{"text":"Closest Jack's to my place.  Like coming here since they offer 10% off.  Decent deal to grab a burger or some tacos.  It's fast food so not much to say.  Just trying to get a bang for my buck.  Service is great and the place is clean.  Parking is easy since it's a big lot."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast at 7:30 am on Thursday and they were just standing around not doing anything. Then \"josh\" the acting manager took our order. Told us no pancakes ok so we took the French toast instead. Then after waiting for 20 minutes we got our breakfast that was cold and greasy. The French toast looked and tasted as if it had been in grease for two days!
The bacon was slimy!
We returned it and got our money back. Went to mcd's. Greeted with a hello, and served a delicious breakfast in less than 5 minutes.
The place was clean and again wonderful service. Not ever going to jack in the box again!"}
{"text":"While I'd weigh 400 lbs (or more) again, I could honestly eat here weekly and be SOOOO happy with life!  The food was decent for the price you pay...and I didn't get sick :-)  ROCK ON!"}
{"text":"Stopped here today at 5:30am after work for the two for $3 Jumbo Jacks. Both burgers were great and just the way I ordered them. But the highlight of the visit was an employee named Alexander. He was so friendly and nice. I wish everyone had the positive attitude he had. What a great employee and a real asset to your company!!"}
{"text":"After a terrible experience the first time I tried jack in the box years ago Iv been hesitant to try it again.. 

But wow. This has change my mind for good! 

Best burger from a big corporate chain Iv had hands down (bacon Swiss on a butter bun).

Fries were fresh hot and crispy with the right amount of salt.

Couldn't fault the service. 

All round great experience."}
{"text":"I love the ultimate bacon cheeseburger. I literally could eat that sandwich every day. My trainer would love that and probably punish me with a five mins run and 400 crunches. It might be worth it though, I'm feeling hungry.
They need to replace their dance thru speaker though as I always have to repeat myself. That's the only reason they don't get 5 stars. #ubc #yummy"}
{"text":"Just bought 4 Breakfast Jacks.
Most locations are good.
This location today badly over microwaved my BJ!
Buns were really Gummy & shrunken!
I thought they had specific required timing but they probably threw all 4 in at one time & microwaved the hell out of it???

I usually love eating Breakfast Jack  but not today!
Ruined my craving!"}
{"text":"It's a 24 hrs fast food 
It's now well over 35mins we are at the window. Fast food  should be a lot quicker 
If u have no options the this is the place 
I could be back 
But the food sucks 
Later nighters can't expect gourmet food"}
{"text":"Ahhh fast food!

Its all the same! Well here the food isnt super greasy!! I love the grilled chicken options they have as well as their breakfast sandwich, but i get it without ham! The price is ok, you pay for what you get right? I also like their curly fries!

One weird thing is that they do not give a toy with the kids meals! Left my son hangin! Anway I come here when Im in this area."}
{"text":"Service is consistently slow here. Pretty bad because it's supposed to be a fast food joint. Additionally, they've given me the wrong orders numerous times. Plus, the breakfast croissants are not fluffy here. It's almost like they were placed in a panini press because they are so flat. 

I only go here because they are in a convenient location. Otherwise, I'd try another store.

On a separate note, Jack in the Box doesn't serve those tater tots type of hash browns anymore. Now, you get an unattractive, single slab-like serving of them. At least for me, I don't particularly like this change."}
{"text":"First he doesn't listen to my order or give me attention . And forgot to give me my hamburger . And gave me two breads and a piece of chicken as a sanwich ! Lazy employee named John . Needs to be cleaning not taking orders !"}
{"text":"I love this Jack in the Box restaurant because it's not so busy all the time. They have polite employees & quick customer service.. It's also  very clean"}
{"text":"This place is across from the college, and I'm sure gets a lot of student business, but I've never seen more than three people in it.
 Those three people are usually homeless. The last time I went in for a quick 2 Tacos for $1 I was asked for
Money five times in twenty min. That's about typical here.
 They are almost always out of cherries gor the shakes, or they just don't want to add them, who knows.
 When I left I felt vaguely sticky, and drove  with the windows down for a while. Seemed to help."}
{"text":"Service is always fast and my food is always warm . They always get my order right and they always ask if I want more ketchup or hot sauce they are very friendly and have great attitudes"}
{"text":"This location is always fast and they get the orders right every time. I have never been shorted an item. This place is usually very lean and the staff pretty nice.

I love Jack in the Box for one reason and one reason only-- TACOS!!! They are nasty greasy but OMG good. Me and the BF love to go here and order like 12 then come home and just stiff our faces. 

I have had a chicken sandwich here one time and it was also really good. I just can't bring myself to get away from these tacos. 2 for .99 is a great deal!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, jack in the box is one of the most inexpensive food chains out there and their food is really quite delicious especially for the inexpensive cost."}
{"text":"Service definitely not with a smile, but the food is consistent. I wish the tacos came without sauce standard. They're not edible with the sauce so when they mess that up it is saddening. Our guy tonight was Matthew - he had trouble hearing us and was obviously frustrated at the issue. Very snippy."}
{"text":"Jumbo Jacks and their milkshakes are the two main reasons for me visiting Jack In The Box. This has been true since I was in college.  This location is clean, the staff are on the ball, orders are always correct and ready in a reasonable amount of time.

I am a fan, even though I try to cut back on fast food chains in general."}
{"text":"Jack is the spot for greasy fast food- and sometimes that's all you want!! Get the chicken strips, and a grip of ranch. YUM!"}
