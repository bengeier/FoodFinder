{"text":"Worst Gyro ever. Dry, overcooked meat served with soggy fries."}
{"text":"First impressions are key. I had the Gyro combo with fries & i added side greek salad. We also ordered the chicken gyro. Hands down one of the better gyros i've had. Great price& quality. 

Like the Terminator \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"We love this place and pick up food every few weeks.  Best Greek food we have found in town by far.  Love the gyro meat and salads are always fresh.  Staff are always friendly and prices are fair.  Highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Greek food; this spot will not disappoint you. Everything on the menu is made to perfection. The portions are more than generous and the prices are very reasonable. The customer service is the best as well. Everyone is very friendly and always seems happy to be there."}
{"text":"Small cafe with limited parking but the food and price is worth it! AMAZING Greek Food. Lunch specials. Healthy and fresh food. Customer service was excellent! I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The chicken souvlaki is phenomenal. My husband and I both had the chicken souvlaki sandwiches and the marinade on the chicken was well done! The tzatiki on the sandwich was great as well. The french fries I was disappointed with that but overall highly impressed."}
{"text":"Great food. Crunchy crusted falafel,  Greek Salad with SO many chunks of feta (\"That's the best part. Of course we give you that much!\") Delightful counter person, eager for us to enjoy. If I lived in Phoenix I'd be here every day. And I'd weigh 20 pounds more!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Phoenix! My wife and I have been coming here since it opened. We come here once a week every week! It's gotten really busy as of late, but hey that only says that they are doing something right!  Try it out you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I ate there last night and found 3 pieces of hair in my food.  The place was dirty and my chicken seemed undercooked.  Will never go back.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant last week in route to work as my destination was close by. I decided to stop in and order some food to appease a potential client. It smelled so good so I decided to go back and order some food to go for my boyfriend and I. We loved it! The hummus was tasty!! I love hummus, and I'm very picky about it however, Nino's was yum! I also ordered a pita club sandwich to share and it was so unique! It was very good! Hit the spot..most definitely comfort food. Greek food is one of my boyfriend and my favorite foods! We love pita! I also love that the owner is greek and he was the one cooking. You can tell he puts his love into his food!"}
{"text":"omg ... Best Greek spot in Phoenix Hands down!!!! I got the chicken shawarma combo with both tahini and tzatziki sauce . IT WAS GREEK LIFE! I almost cried when I encountered my first bite. Amazing from first bite to last morsel. I will be going there for lunch at least 1-2 times a week. !!!"}
{"text":"Well the wife said it was to cold for the welcome dinner. So I found Ninos instead the chicken souvlaki was great."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Nino's today for the first time. I am moving around the corner from them in a couple of weeks, so I thought I would try the new \"neighborhood\" joint. 

I left unimpressed.  I ordered a gyro combo, with greek salad and drink.  The price was very reasonable, at $7.95.. I asked for both without tomatoes. When they brought the tray to my table a few minutes later, I immediately noticed tomatoes in the salad. The girl apologized and had them make me a new salad.  The gyro was on a \"standard\", grocery store quality 6 inch pita. The meat, while a generous portion, was the generic, processed gyro meat. There was a very small amount of tzatziki  sauce on it, so the gyro was dry.. The salad was again a nice portion, but the cheese sprinkled on top did not taste like feta.. Maybe just a very bland goat cheese. None of the flavor that a good feta provides. And my biggest complaint on the salad was the dressing. I have had many a Greek Salad in my day, and they always come with an oil and vinegar based dressing, with oregano, lemon juice, etc.. This salad had what tasted like Ranch as the dressing. 

I try to frequent small, mom and pop owned businesses when i can. But I won't pay my hard earned money for something that doesn't live up to my expectations.. 

If you want some good, inexpensive Greek food, try Greka Pita at Camelback Colonade instead.."}
{"text":"Very nice people , really glad to have them in the area. Great lamb and chicken pitas! Not much else to say that hasn't been said, Ive only had the sandwiches but will have many more."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant! I had the chicken souvlaki pita. Chicken was moist and juicy and I love, love, love the pita bread. Thanks Nino!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a gyro and decided to check this place out. I was impressed. My gyro was delicious and freshly made.  I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened, we live right by it and always drive past it but hadn't had to chance to eat there. My boyfriend and I decided to get take out from here on a Friday night and i am so glad we picked Nino's! We had tried another gyro place a while back near us and it was okay but this place is why I love eating at Local joints. They service was genuine, place was clean, the vibe was great over all, and food was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little hideaway. Staff is really pleasant and helpful, place is always clean and prices are within a retirees budget. I had the lamb skewer and took a gyro home. 3  meals for me! Definitely a return to spot...better than any I have had to date!"}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel platter for pick up and it only came with falafels, fries & a tiny salad. I was thinking I would at least get hummus or maybe some tahini with tabouli ? Hmmm this place just has fried junk. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"This place is great. Authentic greek food with big portion and also inexpensive. I hope they dont change."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and fast. I was in a hurry and ordered my food Togo. I was able to order and head out within 10 minutes. I ordered the Gyro Combo, which was amazing. Tons of meat and fresh veggies. I think I just found my new regular lunch spot. I can see them becoming like Chicago Hamburger Company at lunch with lines out the door and many happy faces."}
{"text":"As a Greek, I can tell you that this is a great, reasonable, unpretentious place. I know what Greek food is supposed to taste like. Don't miss this if you want real salad with real dark fresh greens, and real light delicious dressing. It is so refreshing to get a salad where you are getting your money's worth that does not have that awful inevitable sugary taste that almost every restaurant is sticking in salads these days. Have you noticed the ever present and unwelcome sugar in salad dressings lately? Eat here. It is so reasonably priced and they play Greek music softly. You don't have to put up with a blaring tv or the latest top tunes. This is a true Greek place."}
{"text":"First off, the chicken slouvaki and gyro meat were excellent.  My disappointment is a reflection of what is called a Greek salad.  Coming from the East ( I know hate me), and a large Greek community, I am use to a Greek salad the likes I have had everywhere except here.  All I wanted was a Greek salad.  I saw the new sign and was delighted then I saw the salad and I almost cried.  Some sort of Greek/Ranch dressing, some sort of cheese product.  I like my Greek salad with olive oil, vinegar (white), lemon and real feta, olives, real tomatoes, and option of anchovies.  Am I crazy?  Is my expectation unrealistic that a Greek salad would be universal?  I would gladly go back if they serve the real salad and not some I don't know what it is.  Please, please make the salad as good as the meat products then I can have a truly great dive dining experience.  PS: the salad we had was not the same salad featured in the posted photos.  Are the other reviews real?  Or is there special salad for special customers?"}
{"text":"My new go to when I need a gyro pita or platter! Quick service with nice patio seating. Parking lot is a little tight but there is public parking on the street. Would recommend for a causal lunch meet up."}
{"text":"I would best describe myself as a picky eater.  I eat to live vs. living to eat.  I was extremely pleased with the Gyro I ordered.  The temperature and presentation of the food were excellent.  The Pita was delicious, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nino's may be a pain in the butt to park at, but the food is worth the inconvenience. It is a great casual lunch spot that I frequent at with coworkers every week or so. 

The Greek salads are great and the smaller size is definitely enough food. Here's a tip for you - I would recommend asking for the salad dressing on the side. They tend to drench it in dressing, but if you apply it based on your own preferences it will be terrific. You can even ask for a couple of pieces of falafel on top of your salad and they will happily do so. The falafel is delicious!!!!

Make sure to give them a try if you like Mediterranean food! 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for take-out for the fam. Gyros all around with Greek salads and baklava. All of it was delicious and the baklava rates a 10 out 10!  Super fast, I was in and out within 15 min. It was my first visit and plan to be on my rotational eating out locations."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I tried the baklava and it was super yummy. Never tried it before. Definitely worth the drive downtown"}
{"text":"Chose Nino's based on its good reviews and we were in the area so we stopped by to give it a shot.
Food was good service was great..
I had to try the classic gyro and it was delicious
My lady went with the falafel platter.(good size portions on both)."}
{"text":"The keys to great Greek food. And Nino's got them all!

1. Real romaine lettuce.
2. Tons of meat.
3. Awesome (yet subtle) Greek music.

It's a given that it's all fresh, the location is quaint and comfortable. Service is genuine and fast, and did I mention the food is fantastic?! Prices are great too, just wish I lived a little closer... 

The chicken pita sandwich was fire grilled to perfection, with lovely a spiced flavor.
The gyro was crisp and succulent. I love that there was so much meat in both of them that the toppings gush out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. It has the best chicken schwarma and they use great spring mix for the salad.  Don't let the casual nature deter you."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food! The service was great! The girl at the register was super friendly and went above and beyond! informed us that ordering our food differently would save us money and if that wasn't enough she brought out an extra basket of fries because she felt that the amount of fries given with the combo wasn't enough!! She made our experience and we will absolutely come back, not only for the great food but the GREAT service!!!"}
{"text":"This place is like comfort food to me. It reminds me of legit Detroit Greek food I grew up with. I actually have a hunch that they are from MI. 

The falafel is delicious both on its own, the falafel pita is the bomb, I always add hummus to my falafel pitas to make sure it's not too dry for my taste but theirs doesn't need it. The falafel is flavorful and moist already. 

The gyro is absolutely the bomb. It's surprising how many places can really f-up a gyro, and refreshing to get exactly what you want when you get the craving for a good ass gyro. 

Their lamb souvlaki is good as well. They have good portions of everything. I really like their Greek salad dressing. The fries are always hot and crisp. The rice is okay. 

Hands down this is the best Greek I've had in the Valley, I've tried 4 or 5 spots. A plus is how friendly they are, and the care they take when prepping/serving the meal."}
{"text":"Possibly the best gyro I've had in the Central Phoenix/Midtown area.  In fact, I'm sure of it.  It's meaty, it's filling, it's seasoned well.  It is damn good!  The tzatziki sauce has a unique flavor, unlike any other tzatziki sauce I've had anywhere else. The same with the Greek dressing for the salad (they call in something else in fact).  I couldn't believe how stuffed the pita was ... I was so happy about that!  The falafel is also out of this world good.  I only ordered one because I'm skeptical of falafels in AZ.  Some places don't grind the chickpeas up enough for me.  Some places' falafels taste like they came out of the frozen food aisle in a grocery store.  Here at Nino's they're perfect! 

The atmosphere is super casual, definitely a neighborhood place. When I pulled up during my last visit and my GPS said you've arrived, I almost thought this was someone's house.  I didn't care, the yelp reviews said try it.  I hope my review influences you as well.  I dined in - well outside on the patio.  When I first arrived there was only one couple eating outside.  By the time I finished my meal there was a small line on the inside (about 5 people in line) and 3 new couples dining outside.  Clearly, place is a favorite amongst many. I'll most certainly return again and again  

Oh ... There's free wifi"}
{"text":"Nino's is in a nondescript location but serves up some really tasty food. I had a half Gyro half chicken shawarma plate which came with rice, pita, fries, and salad. The salad was fantastic, it looked very simple but was fresh and flavorful beyond its appearance. My favorite thing on the plate was probably the pita. Each piece was nestled underneath the meat portion and absorbed those juices without getting soggy. The surface of the pita was slightly crispy and seasoned with the same mix as was present on the fries, which put it over the top. Staff was friendly and had no problem fixing me up a half/half plate even though it wasn't on the menu. The food was piled on the plate and packed pretty tightly - I was impressed with how much food there was. I'm happy to add this to my rotation of lunch options during the week and I'm looking forward to trying all the other great looking menu items."}
{"text":"Bit disappointed given the slew of five star reviews here.  Chicken souvlaki platter was fine except for the chicken, which was dry (which is only to be expected) and a little burned (which isn't); spanakopita variable across two different pieces but distinctly lacking in feta; gyro meat was of the mechanically recovered and compressed into a block style rather than the seasoned slices for which I'd hoped.  The Greek salad was super, though."}
{"text":"The chicken Shawarma had zero flavor or spice, something that dish is known for! The salad was brown and wilted, had to exchange it for another, the rice was flavorless as well. Customer service was excellent however, and my husband's gyro plate was very good. Wish I had gotten that. Would give 2.5 stars but no option for that. Doubt I will be back as better greek places nearby."}
{"text":"Favorite GO-TO place tonight when I'm in Phoenix and craving a gyro meal! The staff there are so nice and the large portion of food given is perfect!"}
{"text":"Have tried here twice now and each dish has been fresh and hot. The Greek salad has crisp fresh romaine lettuce with hot grilled chicken and a variety of fresh vegetable including cucumber, red and green bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. I would definitely come back just for. Is salad. The last visit I had here I got the Nino' Greek cafe sandwich and that was different but, good. I didn't like the cheese sauce but other than that it was basically a pita with chicken, lamb and bacon. The salad is served with warm pita bread. They also have free refills on drinks. The staff has been friendly on each visit and Dulce the girl in the front has always greeted me and other guests with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"I had a craving for fast, inexpensive greek food and I was relatively in the area so I tried this place.  I got a gyro combo with greek salad.  Pita was warm and toasty, good amount of gyro meat.  Salad was small but tasty.  I went around lunch and it was busy but the young woman who took the orders, ran the food, cleaned up after people, etc was friendly and efficient.  She provided excellent customer service with patience and a smile.  I have an appt in the area next week and will be back."}
{"text":"Oh my my. Love these guys. Not only is the food GREAT but the service and friendly atmosphere is superb. Even the customers seem nicer"}
{"text":"Oh my! This place is fantastic! Z-Greeks down to he street had me fooled. This place is legit."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and ordered the Gyro Platter & baklava.  The platter came with fries, rice, salad, meat, and pita... more than enough food for 2 people.  It was fresh and delicious!!!  The meat was cooked perfectly with a little crisp, yet tender texture & the dressing and tzaziki was yummy too!  Definitely fulfilled my Greek craving!  Would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today.  Loved it.  Excellent hummus, chicken pita was a little spicier than other Greek places but I think that made it a step above its competition.  Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"ninos is great i love their gyro. Ive had their burgers and salads and havent been disappointed yet. I love bringing my coworkers here because there isnt another gyro spot this delcious around. The only thing Id love for them to change or upgrade, is their parking lot. Every person Ive brought here has mentioned how wonderful the food and location is but how horrible their lot is. My little car bottomed out with one of their holes in the lot. Other than that ninos is perfect"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. The gyro burger is the best. We travel from Mesa to eat here because it is worth it!"}
{"text":"We got here for dinner and were we glad we did .The food was hot and tasty plus flavor ful the menu is affordable and has a variety of selections."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix.  I always get salads for lunch, and Nino's provides a delicious option when you're ready to get your green on. If I'm paying $8-10 for a salad, I expect some substance and not just a pile of iceberg lettuce with a lame chicken breast. Nino's has deliciously flavored meat (both gyro and chicken) that tops a huge pile of fresh romaine and complimentary vegetables.  Included is the Tzatziki sauce for the free pita and a side of Greek dressing that surpasses any I've had in the valley.  The portions are enormous and the service is quite good.  From the outside, Nino's doesn't look like a 4-star establishment, but my tastebuds and pocketbook think it's the best!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The hummus is flavorful and the pitas are thick, warm and soft. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I cant get enough of this place! The food and the service is definitely what keeps me going back (on a weekly basis). I normally order the chicken breast with extra salad and no fries. I am obsessed with the rice!!! Valentina makes the best rice in town hands down. I have not had a bad experience here at all. They all seem to enjoy their work and always provide an excellent customer experience when my husband and I visit. Be sure to check them out and try the rice. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best authentic Greek food! My fiancé and I both got the gyro with fries. I recommend getting the fries without seasoning because it gave us really bad heartburn. They make perfect to Zieke sauce :)"}
{"text":"Small place, huge taste. The food was made fresh, and it was amazing. The staff was friendly and had great recommendations on what to try. I would definitely come back here for some tasty Greek food."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were in the mood for some Greek and she suggested Nino's. She spoke highly of their humus. So I thought I give it try. 

I'm definitely disappointed. But I'm also very picky. She had the humus and French fries. She loved it. 

I had the chicken shawarma. I've had it at different Greek places before and loved it so I figured why not. The chicken on it was very disappointing. It is seasoned with something that resembles cinnamon. I don't usually like cinnamon on my chicken, I may be the only one. This chicken is seasoned so much that it made the chicken look like chicken thighs and I'm pretty sure it's chicken breast. The seasoning is so rich they should make it known to customers. 

2 stars because it was a to go order and service was great. It was fast and the girl was very pleasant. She even let me try the sauce for my chicken shawarma because I wasn't sure I was gonna like it. She actually suggested it. I love good customer service. 

Too bad the food for me sucked, I don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"WOW!! what a pleasant surprise.
We went in day 15 of operation & went BACK day 16 & now going for lunch day 17!
We've had the chicken, the lamb, the salads, the pita, the gyro, the rice everything was fresh & made to order. Everything was truly delicious & great value.  
Even better than the most popular food cart in downtown Athens as recommended by Globe Trekker.  What a treat.
The place is clean, the owner is attentive & they have either fountain drinks or by the bottle ....nice touch.
The food is created from the recipes of the owners family & boy can you tast the love & care in this food.  
Have to go because they are opening soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots! I am a creature of habit and always order the Greek salad with chicken but it's just the perfect delicious and filling salad. The warm pita is a huge plus too! I usually order takeout and it takes maybe 10 minutes or so. The staff is always sweet. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food!  Love it!  Perfect when watching some bands across the street at Rip's."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I always get a modified chicken pita sandwich with hummus instead of tzatzeki. The chicken is juicy and flavorful, the pita is fresh and the fries are seasoned to perfection every time. Nino and his crew are always super quick, clean, and of course friendly. I have recommended this place to everyone I know and never heard a single bad remark. If you love authentic Greek or even like to customize your meal, you'll enjoy Nino's."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean and quiet. You may sit outside or indoors. There is one TV on but not loud. I'd prefer a restaurant without a TV in site, isn't that why we go out to eat? To enjoy the food and the company of each other?
I had the steak pita. The meat was tender and delicious. The pita was soft and warm. My husband had the lamb platter. A good helping of lamb as well as rice, fries and a beautiful salad. All very good. Don't judge this place from the outside, it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have Ninos in my neighborhood.  I have been here twice since it opened, and I expect my four stars will soon become five stars.  I have not tried enough of the menu yet to give it a five star, but I am looking forward to it.  The gyro platter is big and tasty, there is so much meat.  This is the issue I had with an unnamed greek restaurant on 7th Avenue where I received three or four strips of gyro meat on a pita.  Ninos does not skimp on the meat.  The salad was pretty big too, and the tomatoes were red and juicy, not that anemic orange whitish hard kind of tomato that has become the American standard.
Ninos seems to consistently be doing a pretty brisk business in the evenings when I walk by with my dogs, and that alone says more than my one review.   I recognized the cook at Ninos, he had worked at another very good greek restaurant I often frequented over the years, so I know this place will be a hit."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but we got our gyros and both only had 4 pieces of meat. I had the lamb and my boss had the chicken.  If they are going to charge crazy prices then they should at least put out a good product.   Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"OMG, I went here and ordered the Greek Gyro Cheese Steak and it was BOMB.COM.  My friend ordered the Gyro platter and was overjoyed by the taste and amount of food he received.  If you are looking for a good Gyro spot, you just found it."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here in a few weeks and it was DELICIOUS! Had the falafel pita the first time and just completed the arduous task of finishing off the lamb souvlaki platter (serving size was huge). Both were tremendous, but the lamb was INSANE. Tender, juicy, flavorful, perfect. You can tell they highly value their customers as well - the cashier remembered me and welcomed me back. Amazing dining experience for a local neighborhood joint. 5 stars well deserved!! They get bonus points too because the local firefighters came in while I was there, so that added a little something different ;)"}
{"text":"Gyro was delicious and the fries were crisp golden and seasoned . Husband had the chicken shawarma but I was not a big fan, and he too wished he would of went with the gyro . It had a funny after taste, almost like cinnamon flavor . But I'm assuming that it's a personal taste thing. Other than that it was great."}
{"text":"Love it!  Had the lamb souvlaki platter the first time. So good. Today is the chicken souvlaki platter.  Super delicious.  Seasoned beautifully.  Salad is great. And the fries are done to perfection.  Reasonably priced for such great quality food.  Oh, and the platter portions are huge...best if shared between two people, or one extremely hungry person."}
{"text":"This gyro is better than the ones I have tasted back home in NYC. I wish I lived in Phoenix I would visit often. If business brings me back here i will definitely come back and eat here with my family."}
{"text":"What I've got to stress about this place is quantity over quality. It's a basic counter-order set up with slightly limited seating options (unless it's winter, in which case the patio looks nice). The food is basic Greek place- for instance, I had a salad that was just lettuce with some veggies and gets stuck in there. It was all fresh, though, and for what you pay, the portions are OLYMPIAN in size. Check their daily special when you go in, or just order the cheese fries, they're always good."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place.  I come for lunch with some work buddies and I have YET to be disappointed.  Fast service considering how popular it is at lunch.  Food hot and very tasty.  Generous portions so be prepared for a to-go box.  The place is small in size and seating is limited but that is by no means a reflection on the food.  I usually don't rate seating - My ratings are based on (1) making an order, (2) receiving order in timely manner commensurate with the traffic, (3) get my food as ordered, (4) it is tasty, (5) they know \"who\" their customer is and take care of them. 
This place hits all marks!"}
{"text":"Glad to have finally tried this quaint little spot with great food and very friendly people. The lamb souvlaki platter was so delicious - skewers of tender grilled lamb served with warm pita quarters, rice, perfectly cooked fries, tzazika, and a goodly serving of Greek salad. Great food quality and quantity for the price. The restaurant itself is cozy, very clean, and has a nice patio area that I'm looking forward to having future meals in when the weather gets milder."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!  Wow my gyro salad was huge and so yummy!  My family ordered gyro sandwiches they too were big and tasty.  We're visiting from CA but decided the next time we're in Phoenix we'll eat at Nino's again.   Nino is a nice guy, working alone but our food came out fast and fresh!  I can't wait to eat the other half of my salad later today."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Great food, great service, and huge portions. I usually get the village salad with grilled chicken on top, the salad is not on the menu but you have the option of ordering it. The gyro platter is huge and big enough for two people to share. Wonderful little place that I will continue to visit as long as I can get my village salad."}
{"text":"Had take-out lunch here for the first time. Ordered the Gyro Platter, which costs $11.
Barely worth $6 to be honest....
The platter comes with meat, lemon rice, and seasoned fries. The rice was pretty plentiful, about 2 scoops, but it was incredibly bland and cold; ate it because I was hungry but could have just as easily left it, it was forgettable. The fries were cold, limp, and soggy, and did not come with any condiments. 
The gyro is your typical mass-produced processed minced meat, not actual authentic lamb and beef gyro steaks. That is always disappointing! 
Surprisingly the platter did not come with anything else and I had to order a side of pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The pita bread was decent, but definitely mass-produced and sold to Nino's, not fresh or homemade. The sauce was also decent, but was way too heavy on the dill which overpowered everything. 
So that is what you get for $11 - processed minced & pressed meat, cold soggy fries, cold flavourless rice. 
I won't say this lunch was bad, but it was not good either. I've had worse, but I expected much better based on the top-heavy reviews here. 
The reason I tried Nino's is because we stopped going to Greka Pita since the bizarre changed in ownership, and I don't really see myself going back again.
Very unimpressive  - generic, bland, and expensive for what you get. 
...I'm still looking for good authentic Greek in the valley. Where is it?"}
{"text":"Gyro Combo or Platter is straight fire. Like gah damn it's so good. Local spot with a super nice outdoor patio and is ideally never too busy. 6/5 stars."}
{"text":"Prior to today I thought the only place to get a decent gyro in Arizona was this restaurant in Scottsdale.  I found this amazing gem with a few people I work with today and had a feast.  Nino himself actually personally took care of us.

We ordered Spanikopita and Cheese Fries as an appetizer which were both delicious.  The Cheese Fries had two cheeses, one of which was freshly ground feta.  So good!

Next we had Gyro sandwiches with a huge side salad, all of which was delicious.  Being a lover of gyros, I must admit that the meat was extra tender and flavorful.

Lastly, Nino brought us out very tasty baklava.

I will be back to Nino's in the future.  It was a great experience today and I am glad I found the joint."}
{"text":"If you like amazingly fresh food & Z's Greek on 40th street & Indian School (they are related) you will love this new spot. I ordered a lg Greek salad with chicken and it was delicious! If I'm in the area again I'll because to visit!"}
{"text":"Very yummy and HUGE portions.  Its a simple and nice neighborhood café."}
{"text":"Food is so delicious! Ordered takeout and it was super fast. Service was friendly. Can't wait to go again and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! They are very friendly and accommodating!! Wish their was more seating but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Not quite as great as expected based on reviews, but good, solid Greek food in an extremely run-down informal setting. Great tasting Gyro, rice was not dried out -- fresh and delicious. Listen, this isn't for date night because of the building itself (on last legs). But, worth going if you gave a taste for a Mediterranean lunch!"}
{"text":"Let me sum things up in one sentence, and this is me talking.. I made one salad from Ninos two meals. I took half of it home.

Ho...ly...gyro. 

I was craving some Med food badly yesterday, and, low and behold, I jumped on the Yelp app. I found Ninos after passing by several other joints. I didn't realize that this was at the same location as the failed burger joint from a few months back until I rolled up. But, after a brief hesitation, I figured, eff it. I'm super happy I did because it's reasonably-priced Mediterranean food with flavor and generous portions to boot! Seriously, a large Greek salad is enough for two people with big appetites. I've gone to so many places with \"bleh\" Greek salads that are generally just skimpy. Who wants to pay $10 for a shallow bed of iceberg, half a portion of gyro meat, and three piece of red onion? Not me, that's who! I got a mountain of salad, and I'll probably order the regular size from now on unless I want to take half home.

So go. Show your support to the super chill staff, and help build this place's rep up a bit. I'm already looking forward to going back when I get my cravings. Great portions and solid flavor alone would have been enough, but the people there were great as well. Go."}
{"text":"We've been looking for good Greek food restaurant without much success, but Nino's renewed our faith.  The food was excellent, service was attentive and the atmosphere was great.  It's a bit small inside - we were there on a cold day (in Phoenix!) and it was crowded, but for normal Phoenix weather, there is plenty of seating outside.  And as mentioned, parking is limited."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great sized portions, so much so I had to take chicken OUT of my pita & added it to my side salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Side salad was more than enough. My only request would be to put feta cheese on my pita. Maybe they missed it? I will probably make this a weekly lunch outing!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Friendly staff, outdoor & indoor seating, very casual...where the natives eat real food. Greek Salad and Gyros are excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've been going here for a year or two, meeting a friend who works nearby. We're here at least every third lunch. Gyro plate is good. Cheeseburger is  good. But the gyro cheeseburger is fantastic! Especially with a Greek side salad. Excellent service -- place your order at the counter and they bring it to you, then they check back to make sure all is ok. As i said, i love this place!"}
{"text":"We came here because of the reviews and this place exceeded our expectations. The place is casual with a patio. We ordered chicken dishes and everything was fresh and delicious! Great value and clean restrooms, too!"}
{"text":"This place is great! From the friendly quick service to its yummy pitas. I've been here twice , the first time I got a delicious gyro pita combo and this time a falafel pita. The pita is nice and soft and the gyro and falafel where so fresh and really great flavor! Definitely a new lunch spot for me ."}
{"text":"Ninos is in our neighborhood and always our go to spot for Greek food.  It is consistently good and priced reasonably.  We can never go wrong with Ninos!"}
{"text":"Food is gr8 ordered the lamb souvlaki platter highly recommend it!!! Good customer service"}
{"text":"Place is a little hole in the wall joint ( which I normally prefer) but this place is not very good overall. Salad was awful pita was a little stale but I must admit the Gyro meat was delicious! But everything else brought the rating down."}
{"text":"First of all... Ninos by far deserves these 5 stars! This place is the epitome of why I LOVE local, hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Before I get into the delicious food, their service is exceptional. From order to walking out, these business owners know how to treat their customers. 

A friend of mine was craving legit Greek food when I stumbled upon this Yelp profile and Ninos was conveniently down the street from us. This place is probably in a more remote area of the Biltmore area, along 16th Street. It is a charming house with a good amount of tables inside and some bench tables outside. Our party of 7 were the only patrons at the time, so were served in a timely manner and all our food came out in about 15 minutes which to me is great considering our party and number of orders. I believe our party ordered pretty much every single platter on the menu (gyro, lamb, chicken breast, falafel) and each platter comes with pita bread, salad, rice, AND fries with side of tzatziki sauce for less than $10 each. I had the pleasure of trying each platter (yes, I'm THAT person) and oh my goodness... SO SO GOOD! Every meat has great flavor and every element on the platter is delicious and fresh. 

Here's what sets Ninos apart: they made a mistake on my order of a gyro plate, or rather they did not hear it. Everyone else had got their food and when I asked if my gyro plate was coming, they quickly apologized and said it was coming up. I then looked at my receipt and realized they did not bill me for it. When I told them it wasn't paid for and not to bother because I had more than enough to share with my boyfriend and parents, they insisted on making my gyro plate at no cost. Of course I gave them a hefty tip - what I would have paid for the gyro plate. They deserved it! And that's not all. They ran out of rice for my platter and in consolation, gave us a hummus appetizer on the house! Needless to say, our entire experience was excellent. They were so generous and attentive - gave us so much more than what we asked for and expected in terms of side sauces, additional pita bread, and drinks. And most importantly, one of THE BEST Greek food joints in Phoenix. Hands down. I definitely will be a regular here. THANK YOU YELP and YELPERS for this successful find!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the great food and the polite service. And the free soda uh i mean water cup. Lol"}
{"text":"I went on Sunday, mostly on a whim. Since the business is mostly takeout the dining area was empty. Nevertheless I was greeted by their friendly order-taker and told her I wanted their chicken platter. What I got was exquisite. The chicken was well seasoned and grilled just right. Their sauce, which looks like a cross between ranch and blue cheese, has a subtle yet satisfying flavor. Overall I loved the dish and will have to explore more Greek cuisine. Be careful how much you order because you won't be able to stop."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I have had in Phoenix. Very good, affordable and fast service. The staff is nice and you get a good amount of food too!"}
{"text":"I am sad that they increased their prices, but the food is worth it.  Best gyro place in central Phoenix and the salad is huge!  I really want to try the cheese fries, I hear they're delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  This last time I had the Philly gyro sandwich combo with a side salad.  AMAZEBALLS!  Their tzatziki is like crack!  Everything here is so fresh and made to order.   Seriously EVERYTHING is good.  I Just love it!"}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times. The first time is when they first opened and didn't quite have all their drinks ready. So I walked out and went somewhere else.

Fortunately, they have turned the corner and are serving delicious food. I usually order the Greek Salad with Chicken. $5.95 for the salad and an additional $2.19 for the chicken. The whole cost with a soda and tax is $10.33. Nino's Greek Cafe is more moderately priced than a lot of similar joints.

They serve a huge salad. Which consists of iceberg lettuce, green peppers, tomatoes, olives, one big peppercini and of course feta cheese. They serve all of this with a fresh hot pita bread which is cut into four pieces and served in a sealed pouch. Their chicken is perfectly grilled and compliments the salad.

They have a bunch of picnic tables for those of us who like to eat outside."}
{"text":"Satiated. I was doing a trade show/home tour and limited to my booth. The food truck lines were 20ppl deep. Me and my partners hunger continue to grow, impacting our ability to function. Ever hear of hangry? It was starting... slowly but surely. .. I yelped a place between my husband and me and this little place popped up. I've never heard of it before. He was able to swing by and pick up some food to bring to us in two shakes of a lambs tail. We had a lamb pita, Greek salads, and a kabab. All were delicious. Only tip would be to ask for no red onions, they were a little overpowering. We ate, we nourished, we conquered. Thanks for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Only reason i gave a 2 was the service was descent but the food was subpar. Def disappointed."}
{"text":"Come back again! My husband and i live in this area for a long time. This spot has been changing couple times as long as we know of. I am so glad the current one is doing good and can get more busy in the afternoon. The food is very consistent and the service is great. Jasmine is also awesome as Maria. My husband and i just love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I typically call ahead with my order because they get busy during lunch and I have very limited time.
They never disappoint, great food, good prices and convenient location."}
{"text":"For delicious, authentic Greek food in central Phoenix, Nino's is the place. The quality is consistent each time I go there. The price is reasonable too! Indoor and outdoor seating. Or you can take it to go. Friendly staff. I even had Nino take my order once."}
{"text":"Thank you Fellow Yelpers!!! The food was reasonable, fast, fresh, and amazing! I will come back... I just wish they took American Express. I'd come much more often!"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in downtown phoenix stopping in at nino Greek is a must for me. Yes their is a lot more Greek and Mediterranean food places around  but the homey feel at ninos Greek is second to none. The customer service that I am given Everytime I am here is the best I've seen and have received. The staff is friendly and eager to please. The food is amazing everything is made fresh. Food isn't  made until it's ordered. If you are in the area I highly recommended coming in and trying any of their plates theirs no way you can go wrong with anything. Everything on the menu is tastefull and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Chicken platter was good! HUGE serving! Though some of the chicken pieces were a little chewyer than I expected...but still very delicious."}
{"text":"The customer service was fantastic and the take out service was very quick. However, the chicken shawarma was a bit dull in flavor. The pita it came came in was a bit soggy. The side salad was slightly brown and wilted. Overall, I'd give this place another shot but I'll definitely try one of the more popular options next time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food was really pretty good.  I love gyro's and theirs were tasty.  The downside was the service was really slow.  The first time I went I thought maybe it was because they just opened and needed to get their service groove on.  the second time I went again it took about 30 minutes to get my take out order.  It was later in the day and no other customers were ahead of me.  I feel like that location is just cursed to not be successful.  It has been 3 or 4 different places in the last few years.  It is a shame that it takes so long to get your food from them because the location is close to my apartment and I love me some Greek food.  If the owner or employees reply and let me know they have improved their speed I would give them another chance.  Otherwise I will keep looking for good Greek food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Greek place in town, hands down. Nino is super friendly and runs an efficient, clean restaurant that serves positively delicious food! We have been on numerous occasions and have never once been disappointed. As a resident of a nearby neighborhood, we couldn't be happier to have Nino and his team right around the corner."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!
I wish they still delivered but worth the drive over!
The pita bread is really the best in town!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek place. I especially love their Greek salad. Its very fresh, good size and they don't skimp on the feta."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's low-key and hasn't gotten really busy yet when I've gone in. This could easily change any day, this is a well-hidden gem and I'll be sad when my secret gets out. Not sure why I'm posting 5 stars for it actually... don't go here, it's mine ;)"}
{"text":"I would have to say this is the best Greek restaurant I have ever been too.. It's a pretty small place but the gyro sandwich was the best ever.. It was very flavorful and overflowling with meat, lettuce, onions and sauce. The portions are very large. Anyone in Central Phoenix should try this place.."}
{"text":"Big portions. Friendly service. Food so good it made me do a dance at my table.
I have a bunch of Greek restaurants bookmarked to try in the Phoenix area...but I feel like I don't even need to bother now.
Amazing. Delicious. Quality.

**edit**

Been here several times now...great every time. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"This is my new Greek fast casual regular restaurant.  The gyro meat is delicious and they have plenty of outdoor seating.  Staff is friendly, they have Greek music playing.  Get ready to break some plates!  Get the cheese fries, it's one of their specialties and delicious."}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago!!! Seriously the best Greek food I have had in Phoenix!  The service is immaculate and the food is authentic and amazing!"}
{"text":"OMG! Could eat here every day if I could afford it! Love their salads!! Staff are also very nice and fast!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! Always stop in when in this part of town. We always order the falafel pita and the gyro, and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"First time here travelling from out of town. I got the chicken shawarma platter and it was a big serving! Salad was delicious and crisp and the pita bread was warm and soft. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Wow! I know my way around a gyro...and this was truly the BEST gyro salad combo I've EVER had! Well Done! Yiamas!"}
{"text":"Never thrown away falafel, so this place was a new low for me. I had the falafel platter...there weren't many falafels (4) and they were terrible. Tasted more like hushpuppies.

The side salad (Greek, I guess) was covered with a shredded cheese of some kind (maybe feta?) but there was way too much of it...cheese with a side of lettuce. Hardly any red onion or tomato on it.

I really wanted to like this place--and perhaps it is good for meat eaters because of the supposedly giant proportions but we won't go back. It was the worst falafel I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in PHX to visit! The hummus and pita bread is delicious, bread always soft and warm. Gyros and burgers are both delicious! I'm sure the hot dogs are too, but I always go for the bacon cheeseburger. The cheesecake is yummy and the fries are seasoned to deliciousness. Service is always great and there's always a cutie taking your order! My boyfriend LOVES this place and I'm always down to go. Ninos makes us happy, always :)"}
{"text":"As a traveling RN this is one of the places I've kept coming back too consistently after a long shift at work. I checked out a ton of different restaurants in a short period of time here in PHX and this place is cozy, friendly, and relaxed. Nino is mad cool and he plays sports on television during the evenings often, if that's what you're into. The staff is friendly and I enjoyed coming here. Highly recommend if you want something that's more relaxed and chill."}
{"text":"Back for some more! 2nd time here and food is delicious but enter parking lot at your own risk. Dirt parking lot and potholes."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the cheese fries, falafel combo and gyro combo.  Ton of food, couldn't even come close to finishing.  Came with Greek salads which were very good.  Combos were also excellent.  Bathroom was clean and smelled great.  Now just need to figure out if I have any room left for some baklava."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat for Greek food. The two guys working were super friendly and their food was great! Best hummus in Phoenix. Thanks for a great dinner."}
{"text":"Nino's is great! My coworkers and I walk here at least once a week (sometimes more) for their amazing food at great prices. I love this place and I'm really glad it's so close to work!"}
{"text":"Such a great place. The gyro and chicken are both amazing. Service is always great too. Since discovering this gem I've been here ten times in two months. Yep I like gyros  and Ninos keeps it"}
{"text":"Nino's is a habit of mine. My go to dish is his Greek Salad with chicken. He uses the freshest ingredients and the serving for a regular size feeds me twice. The service is A one.  Yum. I'm feeling a craving coming on."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch this week with my wife, son and daughter-in-law. We all had the gyro plates. They are the best gyros we have found outside of Chicago. The fries were hot crispy and a big hit with all of us. Next time I'll get extra tzatziki sauce but that is just my personal preference."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love stopping at Nino's for lunch! The service is great and the food is even better. I usually order the Greek salad with chicken. It's my favorite because the chicken is always cooked perfectly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"OMG. This place is delicious!!! Perfectly priced for great portions. I tried one of their platters 1/2 chicken schwarma and 1/2 gyro and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"We actually came to eat at another spot 100 feet away but they closed their doors early so like some other people we came here wanting something different.
     It doesn't look like much but it's something very special.
     Up front I'll say that it's hard to find good Lamb at any Greek place in the valley. I've had it at every Greek place I've gone to and it's always tough, over cooked and rarely edible.
     I choose the Lamb Gyro. Real chunks of Lamb, properly marinated for 24 hours, cooked on a kebob and then placed in the Pita with all the fixings.
     To say the least it was wonderful. Tender, tasty and very satisfying. I also had the Fries which were stunning. Crisp and delicious. Most fries in this country are never made right. These were. I couldn't have been happier. 
     Some very nice Baklava came home with me and lasted all of 5 minutes once I started eating it.
     You can't go wrong here. They seem to do everything right when it comes to Greek food. I will be back and willing to drive the 17 miles, since the food is so much better than most of the Greek places near me, but one."}
{"text":"love there food always consistent and fresh never a disappointment .  They are reasonably priced and menu has a nice variety ."}
{"text":"This place just has really good food.  I've been twice, had the chicken souvlaki and the gyro.  Both were great, but the chicken was what really stood out.  It was really, really well prepared. The french fries that came with the first time were super good, not so much the second time around, but I went at the end of the night, they were busy, and maybe needed to change the oil but didn't have a chance.  Another thing I have to point out: the people who work there are super nice and helpful.  The level of customer service from both times I was there was top-notch, and I think they should be acknowledged for that.  The building itself... honestly leaves a little to be desired, but you know what, I came for food, and they do a great job of that.  I can't dock a star for that."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Their Greek chicken salad are by far my favorite thing anywhere. Always fresh, always tons of flavor and everything tastes homemade. The place is really small and does get busy during weekday lunch times, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I haven't had much exposure to Greek food for starters. Saw this place on Yelp so thought I'd try it out. I was very impressed with the food!! Had the lamb with a side salad and both were very delicious! I was hesitant about the dressing because I am very much a Ranch type of lady, but I was blown away with how good their dressing is!! The fries were lightly seasoned and very good! Nice clean restroom, thank you!! Sat on the patio and aside from the flies, had a very good experience! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect place to stop pre-flight home! Nino was the MAN booking us up with giant platters of Gyro and Shwarma, the March Madness game, and free WiFi! The food was fresh, satisfying, and not too salty. It's hidden a gem in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"One of those places you drive by without noticing every day. And one of those places that lacks great curb appeal so you wouldn't go in unless you already knew what it was about.

Plainly family owned, with marginal, fast food ambiance. However, the food is awesome. Hot, fresh moist gyros, great fries, excellent tzatziki, and attentive service, albeit at the counter. If you're in the 'hood, it's a MUST STOP."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when I'm craving Greek Food. I usually order the Gyro platter because it has a little bit of everything. It comes with a generous portion of shaved gyro meat piled on top of rice, fries and a Greek Salad. The gyro meat is tasty and shaved perfectly. The rice is nice and fluffy. The fries perfectly seasoned. And the Greek salad topped with the best feta. If I could eat this meal once a day, I would. 
Also, the customer service here is great! Every time I step into this restaurant, I'm greeted promptly and with a smile. The food comes out quick, hot, and ready to enjoy."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate to see another not so tasty \"Greek\" food spot, there was nothing Greek about it, their shawarma was very dried and covered with way too many spices, I've had my share of shawarma to know what it's supposed to taste like and it wasn't even on the rotisserie , it was cooked on a frying pan (ew)... people are nice but I would never go back. The cashier girl did point out that they pretty much only know how to make gyros , I should've gotten the hint but gave them the benefit of the doubt... mistake."}
{"text":"I am so glad that Ninos is in the neighborhood! It's delicious, generously portioned and inexpensive! My standard order is a side of gyro meat and a side salad for $5.00. It's a perfect lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Went there to pick up a quick bite to eat, I ordered shawarma and lamb for my wife. Let me tell you in all my years of eating shwarma in Arizona this is by far been the worst experience ever, overspiced, very dry and did not have a shwarma taste to it at all and my standards aren't even that high for mediterranean food in Arizona. The Lamb looked like it was microwaved about six times before it was served, but on the bright side the service was great, of the girl working was very sweet, i'm great place to go as long as you're not hungry."}
{"text":"Prices were okay, food was okay. Nothing to get too excited about .  Service was timely and the staff was polite"}
{"text":"OMFG, what a gyro sandwich this is, so freakin huge and tasty!!! Just past by and had to stop in to check it out and I am glad I did."}
{"text":"Tried the greek salad with gyro. The regular was a very generous portion and came with pita and tatziki. Not fancy but good food.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty plain jane look from the outside, but the gyros are packed full of meat and taste great."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Friendly, fast and delicious! Dulce is beautiful and helpful and is always smiling. Everything I have ever had there has been perfection!"}
{"text":"Nino's, you make me happy! I've been on a Greek kick and am very grateful this spot opened up in the location it did. I could eat the tzatziki all day! So refreshing and savory. And it's true what the other reviews said, the Greek salad will not disappoint, huge portion and delicious. I also have ordered the Falafel platter which was also a generous portion. Overall: fresh, filling, tasty- with good prices and friendly service. Try this place."}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch in the downtown-ish area. I think it's been here for a long time because it looks fairly old but the age adds a cute character to it. It's a mom and pop style shop and there's seating inside as well as patio seating. Very casual. 
The food is amazing and their gyro meat is delicious. I was on a Greek salad (with gyro meat) kick for a while so I was trying a bunch of places in the area. This is definitely the winner! The salad comes with a creamy dressing, but they have a vinegarette style substitute which is a more traditional style and is excellent.
This doesn't pertain to me but in case it's helpful to others - it doesn't seem very handicap accessible. There isn't much of a walkway so you park in the dirt parking lot or on the side street, and there are just a few steps you have to take to step up to the building. If this isn't an issue - definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Nino is a great guy. I knew him over at Z's and happy he decided to open his new place right next to where I live. Sorry Z, I won't be coming to see you that often anymore :).

I almost always get the salad which the lettuce is always fresh and crisp. I add gyro and if I'm hungry also chicken. We call this extra large monstrosity The Sergeant because a local police sergeant regularly orders this. 

Thanks Nino for taking this absolute hole and turning it into a wonderful neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best pita's I had in Phoenix. The gyro are packed with meat and is well balanced with veggies. The fries are seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The tzatziki sauce has great flavor and compliments the meat very well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed regular Greek salad for lunch today. Great food. Large portions. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Good prices. Friendly staff and clean. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get a great big platter of really good food for a great price. Bread is soft and warm. Fry's are seasoned. Small salad with a healthy dose of feta and ranch. Chicken shawarma was tender and seasoned perfectly and finished off with some seasoned rice. 
Well done!"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here and we just can't get enough! We have tried the basic gyro sandwich (the amount of meat is crazy! So much! I love it), chicken pita, and hummus. All three were very delicious! Plus, the customer service here is great. The woman in the front is always super nice and has a smile! We will be coming here a lot more."}
{"text":"I literally just bought a plate here with my fiancé and son who is 3 and I swallowed something sharp. I looked down and there was a piece of metal in the next bite I would have taken. This piece of metal was the size of a pen point and sharp like it came off a can or faulty piece of machinery.

I tried to handle this issue with Nino's and they basically said they don't do refunds which is the least they could have done considering I had to call my doctor who told me if I have pain to go to the ER.

Please don't bother messaging me about this review or harassing me for posting my honest experience because I have already contacted the health department to review this place so that no other consumers get hurt.

I'm only here to give my 2 cents"}
{"text":"The food at Nino's is excellent!  The platters have everything you could want.
I prefer the Gyro Combo with Greek salad instead of fries although their fries are delicious.  I will definitely be putting Nino's on my list of regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Nino's is in my neighborhood! The portions are sizable, the prices are reasonable, and the food is good! This is the perfect place for a quick lunch or great for a dinner carry out when you just don't feel like cooking. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Phoenix! We've frequented this establishment since it open, and have watch it flourish.. The staff Is Awesome also!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken platter, it was delicious!  and for only $10 you get a very generous amount of food.  Will definitely return.  

Staff is also very friendly, happy 7 month anniversary!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Hubster needs to eat lamb and we didn't want to cook it. So tried this place for lamb skewers. Delish!  And staff so very nice. Willing to make some substitutions on the veggies. We will be back. Reasonably priced and lovely outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My wife brought some food home for dinner from this place and it was pretty good.

I had the gyro philly cheesesteak which was really tasty with the greek salad.  The salad was packed with feta and the dressing that came with it was delicious.  My wife had the lamb Souvlaki pita with fries.  The lamb had a really nice flavor to it.  The fries weren't bad.

Overall, I liked it and would order from here again.  I haven't been to the actual location but I would go if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Great little family run feel -- very nice people working here. Fast, good Greek food.  Spanakopita is deep fried rather than baked - not my preference.  Greek salad was excellent.  Awesome fresh brewed tea and baklava to write home about I will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Greek salad. It's monstrous, well priced, and the employees are way nice. I love their patio! I haven't tried anything else but friends who I've brought with me say their food is delicious too."}
{"text":"I was so ready and waiting for a delicious lamb souvlaki and instead I got this clearly charred piece of meat. Ever so disappointing!"}
{"text":"Having started my fondness for Greek food in Tarpon Spring, FL; I can definitely say that Nino's does it right. I had the gyro platter. It was tender, delicious, and not greasy at all. The portions were generous. This is the first place I have ever eaten where I actually liked the rice. It was light and fluffy.  It is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place ! We went for our first time and the service was amazing, super quick and fresh!!! Super recommended !!"}
{"text":"Nino's is my go to local spot for delicious, simple, Greek food. They are consistent in quality. They have friendly service. The portions are big. The restaurant itself is small, but I've always seen open tables. I normally take my food to go. The Greek salad is on point. The souvlaki is good. My wife loves the falafel pita. If they sold loukamades for dessert, I would be in heaven. Sadly, thats one thing that's missing. But as it sits now, it's a great, fast, reasonably priced, local spot for Greek food."}
{"text":"We come a couple of times each month. Everything is carefully prepared and flavorful. The Greek salad is special and the rice is tasty, so it's best to have the menu specialties as a dinner. I am partial to the lamb souvlaki and the gyros. My wife swears by the chicken tenders. In summer bear in mind there are but a few indoor tables."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to spots for a quick dinner during the week. Nino is super cool and usually there cooking. The young lady at the cashier is always so cute, bubbly and friendly. Try the Greek salad with chicken or the gyro platter. The spanakopita is also AMAZING and yummy. The portions are very generous and usually have plenty of leftovers. Just be sure to check your to go orders before you go for accuracy--we had a couple times where we had some forgotten parts of our meal but I believe that was due to newer staff members-- we haven't had an really recent issues."}
{"text":"Overpriced Disappointment! From start to finish service was horrible. Staff was too busy to take our order. They ran off to run out food in the middle of us ordering. Then she got our order wrong. Missed a whole sandwich after our order was repeated to us 3 times! In regards to the food, all the food is pre made and bland BS!  The rice was bland and the salad was literally lettuce and dressing. I wouldn't mind if they had cheaper prices, but one platter and a sandwich was $30. Be ready to bus your own tables as well here. Side note: We just had Pita Jungle and it is a thousand times better and cheaper! Overall, Nino's is Highly not recommended. They should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Just moved here from NY and reminds me of Astoria, NY!! Fresh and great!! Will be returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been in twice and wasn't really wowed by the food. The spanikopita was deep fried so it was oily and doughy. Their salad dressing is different...a tzaziki maybe? Not bad but would have preferred a vinaigrette. Hummus was ok...a little bland."}
{"text":"I munched on the Grilled Chicken Pita with a delicious side salad with plenty of creamy yogurt dressing and feta. This is a fast and friendly healthy lunch spot. Great service."}
{"text":"It is not a place to impress a date and I doubt if you would be allowed to open a place so \"real\" in North Scottsdale.  I guess it is just an old neighborhood, order at the counter, Greek restaurant.  If you want Trendy, this is not the place.  Their lamb is tender and tastier than I have ever had.  If you want good silverware you should go elsewhere, but if you want wonderful, real Greek food, you've found it."}
{"text":"This little gem in the heart of Phoenix has some fantastic choices for eats. The Phillygyro pita is so good you will make noises while eating, you don't want to but you can't stop. They also have a club pita sandwich which is huge but also so darn good. I also love the Greek salad. The cucumber sauce fantastic and I love it with fries, yep fries. Me and the office mates will have this when the day just needs a bright spot."}
{"text":"Great, local independent restaurant if you're looking for some quick, high quality Greek food.  Nino and his staff are always friendly, courteous and professional.  They also do take carry out orders.  Go try a gyro or a salad next time you're in the area!  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Found this on a thrillist list so I had high hopes and didn't look much more into it. Kinda a greasy spoon join-- portions were very large, but not the highest quality Greek food I've ever had, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little Gyro shop. The place is clean and well cared for. The staff was happy and friendly when I arrived. The menu is full of options and there's something for everyone. I ordered the Nino's Cheese fries and they were happy to substitute additional salad for the fries that come with the gyro platter. It was so delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"My last review was about their hours. I can say that they are definitely open on the hours they have posted now, not to mention very yummy food! The portions are hearty and flavorful."}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday at 8:30 PM,  No customers but me, not a good sign.  This is a small place and the kitchen is not separate so lots of smoke in that room. Best to step outside unless you want to end up smelling like a BBQ pit.  The olives they put in salads have pits, but would have been  nice if they told me--almost broke a tooth.   But enough about the bad stuff, I got lamb skewers, salad, rice, fries, and pita bread all for only $12.  Best deal in town.   Will be back.  Good place for takeout."}
{"text":"Food is good staff is friendly parking lot is bad because it's a dirt parking lot other than that it's a nice place to eat"}
{"text":"I loved the cheesesteak gyro with sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms! The side salad was packed with feta and it was fresh and delicious as well. Definitely a must try if you're in the neighborhood."}
