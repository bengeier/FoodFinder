{"text":"Food has always been fresh and good. Soda refills are a dollar. Prices are similar to other good Mexican restaurants where they have free refills. Nice background music and atmosphere. Place looks clean."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD! Had the carne asada burrito, flaverful and so good, loved the tortilla, my wife had the shrimp tacos which she is very picky about and she loved them! The red and green sauces soo good, we will definitely be back. Truly homemade taste"}
{"text":"My mom and I come here often.  We LOVE their shredded beef tacos.  I've also tried their pozole and it is very good.  Love the staff as well."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I figured this place would be great. It was merely okay. The Carne Asada tacos did not have marinated steak. Just chopped skirt steak on a grill. Lifeless. I had them hold the cabbage. It wouldn't ha e saved them anyway. Horchata was bland. I couldn't tell if there was cinnamon in it or not. Perhaps a powered mix?  The refried beans and rice both looked pale. I did not eat them so can not speak for their taste but they did not look appetizing. I also got the cheese enchiladas. Disappointed. Very little cheese. Sauce was fine. They were rolled kinda like taquitos which is sad because I like taquitos and they were not nearly as good as a taquito.   I give place a solid C-. I would pick it over a Taco Bell ever time. That ain't saying much."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm just getting to this place. They've been open 4 years and I've never been.  The tacos are amazing! I did carnitas, pastor and asada... all were great.  Also did the rellanos, they were ok,  but probably wouldn't do them again. All the meats were very flavorful,  the sauces were great,  the beans were really good.  I need to come back for pozole, the tortas and pretty much everything else they have to offer.  The breakfast menu looks good too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I ordered from here . When I arrived the wonderful women behind the counter was extremely friendly and welcoming. The food was perfect and the location was easy to find."}
{"text":"Very hospitable and courteous. The food is authentic mexican, made fresh. Their chips are delicious!!! We've made this our spot."}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Loved the quesadillas and enchiladas. Great service.  Wish I lived in AZ.  I will return when I am back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is very near our home but we somehow missed it. Today we found it via Yelp. Food and service is excellent. Bill had the taco, tostado, and sopes el pastor. He loved it. I have mini beet chimis. Very good. Prices are great and the people are very friendly. We will return."}
{"text":"This place is friggin awesome. Fresh, fast, friendly.  Best I've had in Phoenix so far.  Had flautas (de res) that were crispy, yet tender and flavorful inside.  Very fresh toppings, and a great value (5/order). Tried a single carnitas taco as well as that's my test, other than handmade tortillas, for quality!  Very nice people.  Small place, full on my visit on a Sunday around 1:30. Will certainly visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Don't let the exterior scare you away! The food is authentic Mexican food and the menudo is to die for!! Highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem and so happy we decided to give it a try. The flan was really good and the tacos although they are the mini ones they were packed with a lot of meat. The beans were very good and they have a mini salsa bar. Everything was clean and I appreciated that the guy had a hair net for both his head and beard. The restrooms were also very clean. Good food and very inexpensive"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I'm happy to say we'll  definitely be back! The place is small but very clean and nice looking.Customer service was great ! The food was also good and the prices are fair! This place is also close to my house so safe to say on a long day from work or running around if I don't feel like cooking This will be my go to place"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot, we live 20 mins away and drive here still - the chips before your meal is a huge bonus as food is great too- wife gets combo plate and kids scarf down mini chimis.  Orange drink is great as well... nice family"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Was here on Saturday and it was very busy. Ordered pozol for the first time and it was very tasty. You are given a small cup with seasonings to give more flavor, plus I ordered corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas, just my preference. Pozol is made with bones in it which gives it flavor, watch out for bones when eating. I would suggest stopping by if you are wanting pozol. I grew up eating my mom's cooking and I asked the waitress about the Tripas (intestines) taco and asked if the Tripas are toastie and she said they can make them toastie. So I ordered one and sure enough it was delicious. I only recommend this place if you are aware that most of food on the menu is very Mexican style. If you are used to the old bean and cheese place I don't recommend it. I grew up on there type of food and again it depends on your preference. I'm giving it three stars only because they have to quit placing reserved signs on their tables."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The friend I was with is always looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant that has caldos. She was very surprised that they had menudo on a weekday. Usually that's a weekend dish, therefore she was thrilled. Waitress was very friendly and attentive; my friend usually asks a lot of questions. If the waitress didn't know the answer, she kindly let us know she would ask the cook.  I got excited when we got greeting with chips and they had beans and queso fresco on them! I love queso fresco.  She ordered a menudo, a taco and a guac side. I ordered rolled tacos, a bit small, but flavor wise was good. I ordered them just with sour cream and queso fresco; but usually they are served with lettuce, cheddar cheese and guac. The rice and beans were good, I am usually picky with rice, this one was simple but good in flavor.  We both ordered drinks and dessert, and the bill was about $32. I say pretty good price.   Good flavor, good price, good service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I think this place is way too expensive, but the staff is nice. The burritos are average 6/10 I'd say. Also inconsistent with their available salsas."}
{"text":"Look closely for the little restaurant next to tailor shop and Greek cafe- we almost missed it! Small with about eight wooden tables. Tacos, burritos, quesadillas and tortas! Yummy good food. Great service and tasty food. Mother's Day and we are enjoying  Menudo and Pozole -they were very good. Sweet staff and waitress and lovely place to eat. We will be coming back again and again. I especially enjoyed the Quesadilla de Chorizo and chips drizzled with beans and cheese!"}
{"text":"This is a great lil hole in the wall place. There is a good amount of seating and it has some charm. It's super clean and the service is very friendly.   I've been here a few times and the food never disappoints! I had the Birria and it was GREAT. Very savory and well seasoned. It was served with fresh veggies, cabbage, onions, cilantro, dried chile de Arbo, limes and a very spicy salsa to go with the soup. The waitress was very nice and let me know in advance that the salsa was rather spicy just in case I wanted to try it. Before my meal came out, I was served a basket of fresh crispy tortilla chips that were drizzled with beans and fresh Mexican cheese. It's was delish and well seasoned. There was a salsa bar, so I grabbed some fresh veggies ( radish, cucumbers) pickled carrots and an avocado salsa that was soooo good. I would recommend ( and have done so) this lil spot for some quick yet well prepared yummy Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Really good! The outside of the building looks rough but the inside is clean. The food is delicious! The chips with the beans and cheese was so good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our new go to Menudo spot. 3 times a charm and all 3 times it has been great! We call it in on a Sunday Am and it's ready in 10 minuets. They give you chips with bean dip and it's also really good. Small little hidden spot but Menudo portions are perfect and the bread is sooo good!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been here and everything from the cleanliness to the service was fantastic . Obviously the food was amazing too. We've had Tacos and quesadillas of a couple varieties and the polzole and menudo. Btw they serve menudo and pozole every day! I would recommend to everyone. I would even take an Andrew zimmern or Anthony bourdain if I ever got the opportunity"}
{"text":"Nailed it! We were looking for real good Mexican Breakfast and we found it. We really enjoyed our plates and our favorite rice and beans were on point. The staff were very attentive, friendly and fast.  We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The flavor is on point, one of my favorite restaurants. Beats Taco Mich tacos!!! Ordered a Chimichanga de chile verde with an horchata, girrrrrrl"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great service, and wide selection. Came in here on a Saturday night (6-7pm) and had the menudo and pozole. They hook you up with some free chips while you wait to order. The menudo and pozole was fresh and came with cilantro , onions, tortilla, and limes. Also ordered the champurrado. It was fresh and delicious as well. I really want to come back to try their other food like breakfast burritos and the quesadillas. This place is very clean and well decorated. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Big combo plates. The chips have beans n cheese on them.  Definitely coming back.  Good prices as well!!"}
{"text":"Been craving Mexican food and this place popped up on Yelp.  So, I found it tucked away in a strip mall.  It's a small location, but nice motif and clean.  The waitress/owner was very friendly.  I was served chips with beans & cotija cheese on top.  The salsa was a plastic bottle; but WOW, their basic salsa was nice and spicy and full of flavor.  I could have been fine with that; however, I had to try their more spicy version, which was nice and hot and equally full of flavor.  I decided to try their 3 enchilada combo (I opted for chicken, beef & cheese) that came with rice and beans.  I'm very picky when it comes to refried beans, and the were perfect and well seasoned.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"By far this is a great little restaurant around my area it has really good interior and they have the best customer service. I am so picky with the beans but they have great beans. Plus the salsa bar is so clean . definetly will be coming back."}
{"text":"THIS IS ONE OF  MY FAVORITE PLACES! My favorite item on menu is the Green Chili Chimi. Their chips and beans are DELICIOUS! The Green Salsa  is to DIE for! The people are extremely nice  and make it very comfortable.  This place is worth a try! You will LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Food was ok... order was Wrong, prices on the menu where wrong, got charged for food we never got...  place was a joke will never return. Save your time and Money! Don't Come Here!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! We were greeted on our way in and the waitress brought us some chips with beans and queso fresco with some red salsa on the side and it was DELICIOUS! She quickly brought our drinks and took our order straight after. I got the red chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The food was served quickly and was hot. Everything was perfect. I will surely come back!"}
{"text":"What a pleasure it was to eat here. Being from Chicago there are 2 things to know. One is that I know good food. And two is that the burritos I was brought up on are different than anything I've found down here. I've been all over Phoenix and I've finally found one that satisfies my tastes. It's a very generous size as well. And the lady at the counter was extremely friendly and courteous. The chips come out with beans and cheese on them. There's a salsa and vegetable bar to fix it up as you desire. And the prices are reasonable. The only thing I found to complain about was that the seat backs are too straight up and down. But I only discovered that now because I was leaning forward the rest of the time eating a fantastic burrito. Can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"If you can find a complaint about this place, your crazy! Great food. The beans are on point! While you are waiting they bring you chips with beans and queso fresco. Service is great. Just not enough great things to say about this place."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!!! Everything we had was delicious and homemade. The staff was extremely nice and welcoming :)"}
{"text":"This place always has a packed parking lot. Lights are extremely bright at night, looks like they have flood lights installed. Not a big problem but if your not a fan of bright lights in your face while eating, eat inside. I had their pozole which was amazing and such a big portion. I found many bones that I almost cracked my teeth on, please be careful. It was spicy just enough so I could still enjoy my food. The salsa bar was amazing and of course they have that creamy green salsa that everyone loves! Including me! I tried their al pastor tacos. I ordered without onions but still got onions, so that was kinda eh. They were extremely dry and lacked flavor. Even after adding salsa I didnt wanna keep eating it.   I would for sure come back and try more of their food because what I did eat was good but as for the tacos its a no go."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  Very nice waitress, she asked how we liked it, we said \"Loved it\" then she actually asked \"Why?\" Then we had to explain why....  Fresh food well cooked, cooked to order!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for years and had no idea this great place was here! Wow I've been missing out on great authentic food! I'm an extremely picky eater especially when it comes to menudo and this place exceeds any expectations. Seems to be family owned but either way everyone makes you feel welcomed. A true AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service, very clean, friendly people. Got greeted as soon as I walked in. The birrias was so good."}
{"text":"Definitely looks like the place wouldn't be all that. Decided on this place after my graduation because I wanted to eat Mexican food for breakfast as it was my day. They definitely did not let me down!! The birria de chivo was amazing!! My friend and I both ordered it and we were very pleased with our decision. Mom ordered the menudo with pata, it had too much hominy for her taste but as it is she is not much of a hominy person.   The place can be a hole in the wall but it's worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Impeccable timing out to order to table time with hot fresh is housed. The sauces are awesome. The ambiance is clean cannot say enough good things amazing specials lunch is only $5.99 with the drinks which is also just awesome!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times.  Ordered pazole freshly made, served with with onions, cabbage,  spices and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. Also ordered a carnitas quesadilla. Chips with beans and salsa were also served.  The pazole was very tastey and flavorful. It was not greasey and full of tender pork and hominey with the added cabbage and onions. Need to watch for the bones. The quesadilla was very good. Orderrd some sour cream and guacomole with it. The chips with beans were not very good. Beans were cold and chips were a bit soggy.   Placed was packed on Saturday afternoon. Great selection and unique dishes such as birria (goat) stew."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place for some time and it's one of our usuals. This is one of the very few limited places that I can enjoy authentic Mexican food. We continue to come weekly and of course we bring friends every chance we can. The prices are just right too and good portions of food. Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it had 4.5 stars but I must have ordered wrong items because it was horrible!! First off, walking in seemed like it would be true authentic so i had high hopes. We got chips with beans and a bottle of chile (red).  I typically don't like red but it was really good and the chips were good too! I was sure we came to the right spot. I ordered a burrito with carne asada and my daughter ordered 2 crispy taco plate. First bite of my burrito didn't drive me wild but i gave it a chance. And with every bite,  i had to spit out hard dry rubbery pieces of unedible meat.  Worst quality carne asada i ever had.  So my daughter ate half a taco and declared she was full.  So she asked if i wanted the other one. I said I'd try it.  That taco shell was so overcooked that it fried the chicken inside so bad that it felt like biting into plastic. It was dry into one big singed piece of chicken.  Worse than my burrito .  She didn't like the rice or beans either.  What a complete waste.   I don't know whos giving this good reviews but id rather eat at Taco Bell!! And i know what im talking about.  Im mexican."}
{"text":"First time trying this place the food was good but not good enough to become a regular basic Mexican food can't call it authentic"}
{"text":"BEST POZOLE EVER!!!! I love this place and its really not close to my house at all, but Its worth the drive."}
{"text":"If you want a really delicious plate of tacos with tender but crispy carnitas, flavorful beef and chicken, and supremely good service - look no further. This little spot has my heart for service, flavor, and sheer deliciousness. The chips are slathered with beans to get you started and wow, just yum."}
{"text":"So we have passed by this spot for what seems forever, finally decided to give it a go. Very clean, friendly, and muy Bueno! Had the champurrado just like my nana's! Delicious! Menudo which I very rarely eat any menudo other than my mother's but I had a craving... very good!!! I can't wait to come back tomorrow and try the breakfast!!"}
