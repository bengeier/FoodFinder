{"text":"Food is not great.  This place looks like it hasn't changed since the 80s. Felt unclean to me.  Kids throwing food on the floor.  It's a busy place so obviously some people like it, but this joint is not my cup of tea at all. There's better breakfast places in town with a nicer ambiance!"}
{"text":"It's fast good price. Friendly staff and good food especially breakfast I would go back in a heart beat"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place.  Food: 5 out of 5.  Staff is friendly and not just there to serve their friends!. Staff worked like a team and I never was without a topped up coffee. Cheers.  I found my new breakfast place in Ajax. Oh ya, they have Marmalade! Classy. Lol"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10+ years so maybe this review is a little biased. I've never had a bad meal or bad service here. The staff is fantastic, portion size is huge and you can order dinner food at 7am #win. Mixed grill is great for the breakfast lovers and the Greek food is awesome ! Other honorable mentions include all the soups, spaghetti and hamburgers"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and a good homemade breakfast served hot.  Good coffee too.  Ample seating so never waited.   This is an excellent place to meet up with friends and enjoy a relaxing meal.  Usually order a western omelet and never disappointed.  Thumbs up place."}
{"text":"My brunch was ok. The menu appears to be large but you will notice that many items are repeated throughout.   We ordered the Peameal Bacon with cheese sandwich and it was fine. Bacon was cooked well but overall fell flat because it little talk was just bacon and a small slice of cheddar. No lettuce, tomato or mustard or anything.  The Michael's special went over well with the boy friend...no complaints there.  The coffee was refreshed once but no one refilled our water  Overall I think there is better value to be found at other all day breakfast joints. It lacks a bit of that diner atmosphere also.  What did you think."}
{"text":"I don't recall how I found this place............ but I'm glad I did! The place isn't much to look at, but it's good, fast, and well priced! The service is good and all the staff that have waited on me have been really pleasent.  I'm a fan of the Michael's Special that comes with my choice of pancakes or french toast, both of which are good.  If I'm off during the week I like the \"weekday special.\" Valid before 11 it comes with 3 eggs (any style), bacon, home fries (get them deep fried), and toast. This special for 2, with 2 coffees and nice tip comes in @ $20!  A regular stop I frequent in the Durham area............I say give Michael's a try."}
