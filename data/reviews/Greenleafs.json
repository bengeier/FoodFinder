{"text":"if you can part with $10 to buy an AWESOME and delicious salad, I highly recommend this place! I burn through $50 a week just on lunch! It's so worth it to me :)  Staff are just \"there\", not super friendly, but quite efficient.  Don't expect too many smiles. Just eat their great salads!"}
{"text":"The one thing they stand out for is portion. Their premade salads that are laid out on the counters are pretty popular. You point to the one you like (mixed greens with salmon or shredded chicken or other meat toppings or fruit & nut) and pick the dressing you want. If you don't like the ones they premade, you can order from their menu. They also have panini and other non salad items, which I haven't tried. 
You don't know the price of the premade salads until you get to the cash. Salads range $9-11 ish. You can help yourself to croutons, sunflower seeds and one more thing (I forgot) for your salad at the cash register. I have only tried their premade salads. They are huge and you actually feel full for the rest of the day.
The people are curt; don't expect smiley greetings. Also, their nuts in one of the salads tasted and smelled really, really old. Other than that, a reasonably priced healthy option in that world."}
{"text":"I had a little trouble ordering and didn't get exactly what I wanted. It was loud and crowded and I think the woman taking my order was having some trouble understanding me. The salad I did end up with though was awesome. It had chicken on it which I'm usually skeptical of because its often processed and salty but this was quite good, not salty at all. A nice bed of mixed greens with tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cheese and all or only 9.00$ that kind of price is practically unheard of on the path. I'll be coming back here or sure"}
{"text":"They had me at peanut butter & banana sandwiches. 

This little shop in the concourse at First Canadian Place is a perfect stop for breakfast  - fruit smoothies, freshly squeezed juice, yogurt & granola and, you guessed it - peanut butter & banana sandwiches ($2.50 - pre made on whole grain bread). The blueberry smoothie is pretty fab and a bit more 'hearty' than the jugo juice a few doors down (Greenleaf's makes theirs with some yogurt).

I've never stopped in for lunch but it seems that they do a mean salad business for the lunch crowd as well."}
{"text":"This place has really good salads! They keep out a selection of already made salads if you're in a rush, or you can ask them to make one or choose from their \"salad bar\" type salads (like pasta salads, etc.). They have a large selection of salad dressings that are quite tasty. I usually stick with their house low fat yogurt with dill or the sesame dressing. 

Their salmon salad is really good. The salmon is cold, but is thick and cooked nicely. Not fishy at all. Other than lettuce and salmon, they also put in a scoop of pasta salad and broccoli. It's really nice with the house dressing. 

Reasons why I didn't rate this place 5 stars: Prices are expensive for take out. The salmon salad is $11.50 plus tax, but you get a huge portion and fresh ingredients. The staff isn't the friendliest. They are not rude, just don't expect a free smile with your meal."}
{"text":"I got charged $7 for a Greek salad that was basically half bowl of lettuce, 2 half of a cucumber slice, 3 pieces of tomatos, 4 olives and 1 spoon of feta cheese. the lady looked upset when I asked for some more feta cheese, and dropped a teaspoon or less on my salad. No onions
They used to fill up the bowls, not any more"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's fresh, healthy, and makes nutritious food accessible to many with their very reasonable prices. I get their fresh pressed vegetable juices for $3.50 (large size). Forget the coffee, go for the fresh veggie juice and feel amazing for the rest of the day!

Their staff is hardworking and I appreciate them offering healthy food options so early in the morning. It's great!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  I'm here in the morning picking up their muesli mixed with yogurt.

It seems like everything on their menu is healthy - fresh fruit and vegetable juices, a great selection of salads and wraps too (their Spinach Salad is ridiculously delicious).  It's also the perfect spot to pick up a small veg and dip or a snack of fresh cut mango and strawberry pieces.  

The prices are surprisingly low for this area which is why I prefer to buy my smoothies here."}
{"text":"Seriously, go here. The spinach salad with shredded chicken and light caesar dressing is 7.49 and it is massive. Lots and lots of fresh and healthy options at great prices. Ignore the line, it goes quick. Fresh juices as well. Some seating across from Longo's but its takeout only really."}
{"text":"The $7 jumbo fruit juices and smoothies are the norm here and something I avoid. They may be tasty but I refuse to pay that price. Luckily, I've got Greenleaf's nearby.

It's a salad and fruit bar where they make smoothies, flurries and other juice combos. I primarily come to Greenleaf's for their vegetable juices. A large 14 oz glass costs $3.50. This isn't bad considering the area. They also sell freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice for the same price and size.  

My usual order is the 'Energizer' (carrot, beet, spinach, celery), but now, with winter and work colleagues getting sick left, right and centre, I get the 'Flu Fighter' (carrot, beet, celery, lemon, ginger, spinach). Both are yummy. They have other varieties like the 'Accelerator' and the 'Stress Reliever', which seem to be named after traders at the TSX."}
{"text":"This place was my go to for about 2 years before things slowly started to go downhill. They stopped making the salads on the menu, leaving you only with the salads that were sitting out. They then started giving less salad in the bowls and weighing out the protein, which had smaller portions. Now the bowls are much much smaller and the cost is the same. So disappointed in this place, I really used to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I definitely just got case of food poisoning from a salad I got here, since it was the only thing I've eaten today. Where was a weird pool of water at the bottom of the salad that made me feel kind of sick immediately after eating it. 

:( I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I have picked up several different juices there. They have a few named cocktails or one could simply pick up an orange or grapefruit juice there, which is ready made. The latter choice is the fastest option of course and is something necessary because the juice shop two doors down does not even have a 'citrus' option!
What I do not like about these guys is their pace. If someone orders a juice or smoothie the man at the cash has to make it which means no one is manning the cash or processing other orders.
Like the other businesses around here Greenleaf's is a take-out only option although a few seats are in front of their location."}

kk I'll be honest here... I'm not the biggest salad eater.  I mean at times when I eat salad, it's as if I'm getting punished because I did something bad.  But I did come here with a friend when I was trying to be healthy and the damage... a $9 salad.  So what are my thoughts?

I believe I ordered a salad that was called.. beef teriyaki salad or something (big surprise right?).  It had a nice flavourful beef that honestly tasted more like bulgogi than teriyaki, but no complaints.  In fact, I really like the beef.  Kinda wish they had an option for just the beef with rice. lol.  Anywhooo, it was on a bed of rice with some chick peas, carrots, cucumbers, etc over a bed of mixed greens.  Over at the side when you pay, you get the option to add croutons, sunflower seeds and bacon bits... you bet your sorry butt I added all that jazz.  The croutons were actually really good.  The salad dressing I got was some.. ginger Japanese mixture.  To be honest,  I'm not sure if I tasted it all that much, but yeah.. I'm sure it helped the salad.

Overall, it's not a bad choice.  I mean, I don't see myself ordering $9 salads everyday.  But if I were to go on a healthy run trip again, I wouldn't mind this choice.  I would definitely add more croutons cause frig those were pretty good.  The whole thing was definitely filling and didn't leave me wanting to eat something once the typical midday blues hit.  In fact, I felt kinda awake and alive that afternoon.  3.5 for our friends here... I put down 3 instead of a 4 star cause... it's a $9 salad, dang son."}
