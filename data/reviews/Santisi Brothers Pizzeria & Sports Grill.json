{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago and I am so ready to go back.. The first thing that you notice is the multiple televisions... and being a sports fan that is right up my alley.. The service is good and the food was great best wings I have had since moving to Phoenix hands down... Can't wait for march madness so i can post up in there and watch all the games. ."}
{"text":"Fantastic sports bar located on Bell Road in Phoenix. Wall to wall TV screens showing every type of sport you could imagine! Their food is amazing (White Pizza is worth checking out) and the drinks are relatively priced. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Ruby....   so awsome. .    Keep mixing those drinks.   Great choice on the wings.. sauces...apps.   I'm  a wing and pasta guy from now on.. love this place.."}
{"text":"Nancy the bar tender was awesome and the food is fantastic! Everything we've ever ordered here has been great tasting. Portions are more than enough."}
{"text":"This place has spent more effort on tv screens than its food which was dry and tasteless. Total waste of time,Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time but this sports bar was too sports bar for me so now we get our food to go.  The special of pizza and wings is great.  Cheese pizza has a thin crust but not too thin and the sauce is zesty and flavorful.  Wings are well prepared and delish. They also have mussels which are fantastic flavor wise and price wise.  Ribs are also good.Been there alot"}
{"text":"Good beer, wings and pizza. A lot of tvs.  Waitress was attentive and prompt. Definitely found bada$$ sports bar."}
{"text":"This place has good food. Nice and clean.  However......with an exception of a few lovely  waitresses and cocktail servers, the majority were a little on the ILL TEMPERED side. One shoved past my company, wasn't nice and seemed to have a bit of a nasty a RBF. Another tossed out wings down after saying, \"hey, is this your food?\" Otherwise, it was great."}
{"text":"This bar is amazing. They have an app for your phone heartv...you can listen to what you want...lots of tvs...great food and awesome service!!!"}
{"text":"Had a company lunch here and it was bar-fantastic. The buffet pizza and wings were really good. I was also impressed with their chilled beers. Nearly as cold as TP's. It's a little too dark for my taste, but definitely won't mind If we have another lunch here."}
{"text":"This is the spot for a good time! Pizza is awesome, the staff was great. Tv's everywhere this is a sports lovers dream!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Great atmosphere,  great beer selection and amazing food for a sports bar.  Can't beat their wings and pizza is good too"}
{"text":"This is the worst bar to goto. The waitresses don't know how to serve properly and they're pretty rude. A lot of their food doesn't taste good. Their pizza is more greasy than Sardellas. The hamburgers are flat but round. Their spicy barbeque wings are pretty good. They have free wifi but constant problems with it. Only other thing is good about this place is all the tvs."}
{"text":"Definitely the spot to go to watch the game or multiple games at once.  There has to be almost 200 TV's in the place.  Also fun to play darts there and I know they have Poker Nights too.   Their food however is NOTHING but typical bar food.  Fried, greasy, and way overpriced in my opinion.  $12 for a burger??? WHAT?  And their pizza, I have heard is good, have never tried but way overpriced as well for what it looks like to me.  I do like that they seem to have a vast selection of choices - salads too.  Stromboli and Calzones are on the menu as well.  I also notice that they have daily drink and food specials (nothing to get excited about price wise either).  The service was good, and always has been good there in my experience, so I am not discrediting that.  I will keep going there, but not to eat!  If you want greasy bar fare, there are a MILLION places nearby that are way more affordable."}
{"text":"Our first time. We will be coming back. Food was wonderful and delicious. Price not bad. So many TVs to choose and watch. Staff friendly and happy. Perfect place for family or date. You guys are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Santisi's is a very cool place. The food is surprisingly very good. Most sports bars have average at best food but these guys are going on 20 years now and it's been that long for a reason... The reason being that the food is good! Period. The other reason is that the service is awesome as long as your not a butt head. The bar tenders are really cute and absolutely professional. So are the servers. Very cool girls! I've been going there now for six months and I promise that you can't go wrong as long as you aren't a jackass. They won't put up with nonsense. They don't need to. My name is Joe. I can't figure out how to make my profile legit but I will. My only complaint with this place is the 2 o'clock start. They need to post up at 11. They do Friday sat and sun, but would be there a lot more often if they 86th the late start during the week. They won't. They obviously know what they're doing. If you don't like santisi's it's on you."}
{"text":"Ok... Bottom line awesome awesome food!! I swear they have old ladies in the back stirring up the most bad good food for you ever... The portions are HUGE like literally 2 people can eat off a plate....  Plenty of TV's lol as they do sell their selves for this... What I like best is all the games are on opposite side  of building so no worries.... This place is for everyone young and young at heart alike...,,"}
{"text":"santisis is a place for any sports fan. this looks like some stupid little place from the outside, but it's large and is divided into 2 bar areas. one are is the main large bar with a variety of tables, the big bar, and numerous tvs. the other area is a smaller bar area with tables, darts, pool tables, and a smaller bar.   THERE ARE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES.  the positives:  there are NUMEROUS FLOOR TO CEILING, AND WALL TO WALL tvs. there's tvs on every inch of the walls, large and small. you will see all sports all over the place.  the menu is extensive ranging from your typical wings, to italian, to seafood, to pizza, to barbeque. they are known for their excellent pizza. they do have a happy hour, but i only believe it's for their draft beer and they are known for their monster beers, i think $3.00 or $3.50. the bar is big with alot of tables. large outdoor smokers patio.   the negatives:  it's very dark, almost like a big cave. there are no windows. it gets very crowded and the tables are practically on top of one another. there is zero room to manuever around all of the different tables without knocking into someone. there are alot of really drunk people in here so it doesn't help that there is super limited room to get around.  there are no reduced food prices for happy hour. COME ON, every bar in the entire area accept for padre murphys has reduced food prices or free food during happy hour. they have a $9.00 buffet on fridays from 11-1 with all you can eat wings, pizza, and a couple other things.  their happy hour drink prices are fairly limited depending on what you drink. regular priced drinks are on a higher end. the beer is ok, but if you start drinking shots and mixed drinks, it's higher then other sports bars. their menu items are pricey. just a basket of chicken strips is over $9.00 .  other items range from $7.50-$16.00 .  if you want to watch sports here, GET HERE ATLEAST 1 1/2  HOURS EARLY. gamedays are extremely crowded. the service is actually pretty good considering how busy they are. even though they have tons of tvs, they'll have something stupid on some of them that no one wants to watch, and have the important games on the others, so just because there's alot of tvs, doesn't mean you'll have a clear view of the game you want. and they won't turn the stupid things off. BEWARE, if you are a soda or iced tea drinker, they will give you 1 free refill and charge you for all the rest. they DON'T tell you that until you see multiple charges on your bill.   so, sports,  really good.  tons of tvs. quality food, but pricey.  no food specials for happy hour. ok drink specials on happy hour only. otherwise, drinks are higher then other places. great pizza. very cramped.  suggestion; GO TO RT OSULLIVANS 59 AVE & BELL RD if you want a nicer sports bar with better pricing and also has a huge amount of plasmas everywhere."}
{"text":"More TV's in one place than I've ever seen!! Good selection of cold beers & cocktails and don't go anywhere else for Friday Night fish fry. Huge portions, good food, but the WORST SERVICE EVER and they don't seem to care. The girls all stand around talking with one another where they place orders at the bar, and wander of to take orders or get you something when THEY feel like it, not when you have a need. They don't care, nor seemingly does management as it's always the same. So go for a drink, enjoy the food, but do NOT expect decent service. But do tip accordingly!!"}
{"text":"Let me go ahead and say it. This is the best sports bar in the entire Phoenix area.  Everything is affordable. The pizza is exceptional, and all of the food in general is great. The servers have always been very attractive. It packs in a crowd, and there are some very intense sports fans in the place.  Most notably, Santisi Brothers has what is called the \"Wide Wall of Sports\". I believe there is somewhere on the low side of 100-150 TVs in this place, and it really is not that huge. The wall is quite literally covered with TVs. There are some main screens which are extremely large that the main events go on, but you can watch anything you want on the smaller TVs.  As someone who bets on college football, I can really appreciate a place where I can go in and watch some obscure game that is important to me and almost no one else. I'm able to get a TV to myself while enjoying a really, really, good pizza. Can't beat that.  These are the reasons why this place has grown so substantially. I've watched this place go from mildly crowded on NFL Game Day to packed every single night. It deserves the business every bit. They do a great job.  One day I was in Santisi's with a friend watching a game. We had ordered a pizza. There was a half eaten slice left on his plate. We had finished eating quite awhile ago and were sitting there watching the game. I was confused as to why the server hadn't taken the plate with the half eaten pizza away. Eventually I told her she could take it. Apparently she understood that I was confused as to why she hadn't taken it earlier, and she told me, \"Sorry, I've just learned that you never take food off a man's table unless he's well prepared for it.\" Amen.   Yep, best sports bar in the city.  Oh yeah, don't try to park in the front. There's a huge parking lot back behind the building."}
{"text":"Cool place! TVs everywhere! Music! Game room! And ribs that fall apart in your mouth from being so moist and tasteful!"}
{"text":"3rd update: This is my favorite sports bar. Practically anywhere you sit there is a good view of a tv. There's a few decent craft beer choices on tap. The typical bar food is good but it's the pasta and grill items that are amazing.  The angel hair with grilled tomato, garlic, chicken in olive oil is light but filling. The baked ziti is a big cheesy dish but get it with meatballs. The alfredo is rich, thicc, and tastes homemade.  The chicken and pork chop pieces are huge. They're all griddled with a good sear but still juicy inside.   The wings are some of the best; a bit crispy with a medium that tastes like medium, hot that's actually hot, etc. Lemon pepper is still addicting.  The calamari recipe changed a few years ago and the breading was super dense and dry. But just recently the breading is back to light but crispy.  With football around the corner it can get crazy. Get there early and it can be even more chaotic during shift changes around 4pm. If you don't see a server just get one of the bar backs guys or food runner girls to get them. It helps to know your server's name, too. They're all usually friendly and attentive. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar to watch any game on their selection of TVs that coat the walls inside. The pizza is good but nothing outstanding. The waitresses are nice but sometimes the service is slow because it's usually packed on weekends. All together this is a good place to sit down and watch a game with your friends."}
{"text":"We went here a couple weeks ago....honestly, wayyy disappointed.  Ordered a pizza with a couple toppings...came out and just really was not done hardly at all and cheese tasted gross and super super cheap. Not good. Never going back! The only thing that made it better was our Four Peaks beer"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this bar and i always have an amazing time. The staff is always friendly and the food is great. The drinks are pretty well priced. Its overall a great place!!"}
{"text":"If you are going to watch a game and eat game food, it might be OK.  However we were told by someone they had \"pretty decent\" Italian food.  Maybe they were referring to the pizza because the pasta left a lot to be desired.  Neither dish ordered by us had much flavor.  One was swimming in poor quality olive oil and the sauce on the other tasted like one of those canned things you give kids when you're in a hurry.   Bottom line - for booze and bar food, probably fine but skip the pasta."}
{"text":"It's football heaven for fans. Good attentive service. Been going there whenver Cardinals play away games."}
{"text":"We go every  Sunday night after softball. The Abita is ice cold and the food is great. Our server Katelyn does a great job taking care of us."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time the food is just great.  Keep trying new things and never disappointed.  Service is good and of course so are the drinks.  Big time sports bar with TV's everywhere you look, so if you are looking for a quiet meal this isn't the place, but if your looking for a lively time or wanting to watch the game with good food and drinks this is the place."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ for spring training and golf. After a round of golf we want to check out a sports bar for beer and food. This was a great pick. The walls a covered with TVs, the staff is friendly, the food is great and the beer is cold. Great sports bar!"}
{"text":"Debbie was awesome and needs to be the boss! Been in here a few times and her customer service was on point tonight."}
{"text":"Great place to watch football! Great beer selection. The food is ok..but you cant beat the atmosphere for games."}
{"text":"It's a cool place to hang out and grab a beer after work, or even on the weekends.  Personally, I like the large smoking patio for those times that I want to light up."}
{"text":"My buddies and I showed up on a Wednesday night (4/19/17) and Bailey was our server on the bar side of the restaurant. Her charming attitude and friendly smile made her seem like an instant friend. Her attentiveness and being quick with refilling our drinks were very appreciated. We will return because of her."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Santisi Brothers! No matter what I order on the menu it always brings me pleasure. From family dinner to a night out with friends Santisis is definitely the way to go. Portions are huge, drinks are fantastic, and all around everything is well priced! The weekly poker, karaoke, and bingo just add on to wonderful atmosphere created by the TV surrounded sports bar. No questions asked I'd recommend Santisi Brothers no matter what every time!"}
{"text":"I do like the food here. It seems that recently though they stopped posting any carryout menu item prices online. I'm not a bar guy anymore but I have ordered take out from here many times and maybe I just wasn't paying attention before but I was in for a little surprise the other night. I ordered a standard 16\" Veggie pie and a dozen wings and the tab seemed crazy high to me: $33+ ! I asked to see the register  receipt thinking a mistake had been made and saw that the pizza was almost $23.00. Maybe they are unaware of this but that is A LOT for  regular 5 item pizza. For $23.00 I'm looking for Chicago deep dish loaded...$15 or $16 is more in line for the product tier in this case.  Just a little reality check that restaurants need from time to time"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Santisi Brothers before you definitely need to make a trip or two.  Whether you want to bring your family down for dinner, hang out for happy hour, watch UFC, or play poker Santisi's has it all.    There is an extensive menu so no matter what you want they will have it.  If you love wings you have to try the lemon pepper or Gio BBQ.  Pizza is always a good choice and try the specialty pizzas if you want something a little different than the basic pepperoni or sausage.  There is a soup of the day, Saturday's Creamy Chicken Noodle is my favorite, but there are other great soups such as Chicken Tortilla on Tuesdays and Clam Chowder on Fridays!  Fish Fry on Fridays and Crab legs on Wednesdays and Saturdays are also great choices.  Even if you want to eat healthy you can have one of their great salads or go with pork chops or chicken breast...if you do make sure you get the grilled zucchini as a side!   Santisi's is definitely a family friendly environment as my son and I make it a weekly ritual to come in and eat on Tuesday nights.  The servers are very personable and work hard to make sure you enjoy your time.     I was glad that they picked up the UFC fights a few years back because I use to have to leave poker and find somewhere else to watch UFC.  And if you like to play poker and have a chance to win a $1000 WSOP seat Santisi's is the place to come.    Santisi Brothers in my opinion is the best Sports Bar that I have ever been too.  The food, service, and experiences are great!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first night venturing to Santisi Bros as a fairly large group of us were getting together since we hadn't seen each other in a while.  I always thought how a restaurant handles large groups is what makes or breaks them.  I was disappointed in the wait staff.  It took about a half hour before we actually went inside and asked for a server.  And even then, we only saw her one more time after bringing our food before she vanished for another half hour.  We had to find her to close out our tab before we hit the inside for karaoke.  A good first impression this does not make.  Now, I don't want to make this a wholly negative review.  The food was outstanding.  I didn't hear a single person have a problem with their food.  I had the Chicken Parmesan sub with onion rings. I was thoroughly impressed with the onion rings as the batter appeared to have been done by hand.  Very VERY tasty.  Once we ventured inside, it was a very different story.  The wait staff was much friendlier and far more visible around our table, catching drink orders and in one case, belting out an awesome karaoke track that I, unfortunately, forget the title.  The beer was ice cold and seemed to stay that way the entire time it was in my mug.    The rest of the night was very fun and enjoyable.  I look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday and the place was great...food good, booze was flowing and the darts were flying."}
{"text":"Excellent place to watch a game, grab some food and have a drink!  Not your typical sports bar, this place is more like a sports bar on steroids!  Tons of Tv's and restaurant quality food with an impressive menu.  Everything I have tried has been delicious and you really can't get better ribs anywhere in the valley.  The White Pizza is to die for and the Giovani wings are fantastic. Great place for UFC and they even have poker 3 days a week.  Can't say enough about the atmosphere, food and people."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in many years, but decided to have a night with some friends that landed us here last night. I won't lie; I was expecting to be ignored by the bar staff and servers throughout the night and pay highly for watered down drinks. Much to my surprise, the atmosphere was amazing! Multiple tvs tuned to anything from hockey to UFC and more, friendly servers ready to help with anything you may need, and a restaurant/bar full of smiling, happy faces! And our bartender Jessie was fast, amazing, and just all around a pleasure to have serving us. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is great! Soooo many TVs, perfect for football!  If you go request to sit in Lindsey's area...she's the best!"}
{"text":"Still love Santisis!  It's my regular spot on the way home from work and love to try new things everything I'm there.  We had the Philly Cheeses teak sliders this time and they were awesome!  I always have to get a side of Giovanni BBQ sauce with absolutely  everything I get, I think I might be slightly addicted it it.  Haha.  Staff is great, always helpful and the service time is fantastic.  Even when it's busy, they take care of each customer with care and speed."}
{"text":"Tasty food but over priced for the usual bar food. With that said it is a great atmosphere with plenty of entertainment, you won't miss a game! Staff is great and they offer decent drink specials. I'll be back for the decent beer selection!"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to rate one star because it isnt even worth that. The food is absolutely amazing! But our service was the worst I have ever had. She had no knowledge of what was in what or anything about what I was trying to order. I feel bad for anybody who has Marcella as a waitress because that was just unacceptable!"}
{"text":"wings were good peperoni pizza burger was good. service was horrible waitress was rude took over 20 minutes to get a refill and you only get one free refill"}
{"text":"Been going to this place since it's inception and must say, they use the best ingredients which makes their food taste incredible. Hope they keep doing what their doing..."}
{"text":"I dont appreciate being treated this!  I tried to play pool with a friend and a waitress came by and stood at the other end of the pool table starring at me but didnt say anything. Then I asked if there was a problem. She said uhh are you guys going to buy drinks? My friend said we already have beers in the eating area. So she kept starring like she didn't want us there. Then she turned around and walked away. She was not friendly or polite to us. I didnt want to play anymore. I wasnt going to have a good time if a employee was rude to me. If she was nicer i would have been in a better mood and i was planning on ordering something after i played pool. I dont like their food but i would have gotten something anyway. There were some other things that weren't okay with me while I was  there. I was forced to be there with family but I would never choose to go to this place. I've been here 3 times before and every time I was unsatisfied with the food. Its just not an inviting place. Ive never said anything before but this time I had to post about them. They dont always have the sport you want to watch playing on their tvs."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The server was a complete ___! Megan was her name. The overall feel of the place was pretty good. The food looked pretty good. Service was horrible, so I didn't get far enough to get the full experience."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the fabulous delicious wings from Santisi! That among other great choices off the menu are incredible! I have never had a bad experience at one. This one stands out due to our server ERICA whom was very attentive! Erica took our order very promptly and continued to check back to make sure everything was exactly as we had requested. She anticipated our needs and filled them without asking. Her attitude was the best I have ever seen. Erica recommended the \"Green Tea shot\" and \"Puerto Rican Kiss shot\" which both were amazing!   Ask for Erica! She'll take great care of you! We need more servers like her. She gives Santisi Brothers FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Beyond amazing. Love all the TV's.  My sister introduced me and fell in love.  Huge plates, drinks and beer.  Everyone is so nice too.  Can get very crowded and loud but...It's a bar!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and their bartender,  Debbie, is great...always friendly and takes a personal interest in all her guests!"}
{"text":"You choose how and where to spend your money. Invest in supporting a local family-owned business. We find the staff and owners to be real and helpful. Quite cute too! Do it family style, share a large salad, pizza, and the best meatballs. We like ours with the mozzarella melted on top!  My husband wont leave without the caramel drizzled cheesecake! YUM.  See you soon brothers."}
{"text":"Santisi's is our go to place for girls night. They have good drinks at a good price and the food is better than average.   The veggie basket is big enough for 4 of us to split and I can tell that they are cut fresh.   There are a ton of TV's with every event imaginable and pool tables and darts in the back. the music is never so loud we can't talk.   Then outdoor seating is great in the winter with several heaters."}
{"text":"I have no idea if there food is any good, I walked all over the restaurant to find a table! All tables are first come first serve, there was 3 or 4 4-top tables with one guy sitting at them. All of the 6 or 8 tops only had 3 people sitting there. The waitresses wouldn't even speak to us. When I did speak to one waiter he looked at me and walked right past. I walked up to the bar to talk to a waitress and she was super rude. First come first serve on a busy night is bad business, wasting an entire 8 top table on three people, not to mention 3 or 4 tables. There would have been plenty of room to seat more people had there been any structure. I had 5 people with me that would have been buying drinks and food, there loss. We won't be visiting this establishment again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Santisi Brothers!! I've been coming here for over a year now, and have never once had a bad experience. All of the servers are friendly and fantastic! The pizza (especially the white pizza) are amazingly good! I actually just adopted a vegan diet and I have had no issue altering different menu items to conform to my diet restrictions, and the staff is always happy to make those changes for me. There is no better place to hang out for some great food, beer, and to watch a game or UFC fight!"}
{"text":"Slow, and will say it again slow. We got there at 1:00 ordered by 10 after and after complaing got our food to go a 1:50. Wish it was the 1st time but the 4th at least in the last year. It was not busy and bartenders seem to not care unless you start complaining. We always order one of the specials of the day. Not the only place in town with televisions. We will not be bac k, gave enough chances but feel to many times to not be a normal occurrence. Food is not that great to sacrifice our time waiting."}
{"text":"We've been going to Santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house. We've never had a bad item here. It's a fun place to go and the food is great. We always order pizza which is consistently good. Their salads are excellent - all their ingredients are very fresh and there's enough for two meals if you're a lighter eater. And the wings are always excellent.   We've always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming. It's a great place to watch a game - if you can get in! Friday and Saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our take-out pizza. The parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and there's a dollar theater next door. You can park in back (the side toward the freeway) if there's no room in the front.  We moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and Santisi was still there, and as good as ever."}
{"text":"This is a must go for us when we're in town... Love the Giovanni chicken wings and the Italian donuts!!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but on the expensive side. The games on sports tv channels was comprehensive."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere tv's everywhere for sports. Food is amazing especially for a sports bar."}
{"text":"I'm a little belated with this review, but I can't say enough great things about our recent experience at Santisi Brothers. We hosted my daughter's college graduation party there and they did an exceptional job in all aspects. Working with Toni Santisi was such a treat! She handles all the big parties and special events. Getting to work with Toni and having her exceptional service, knowledge and experience as a party planner included in the deal is a major added perk to hosting an event at Santisi Brothers. The food was great, the staff was friendly, professional and responsive and the patio was so perfect for my party of 50. I was able to book the entire patio for our party and set up a great buffet. I have hosted many parties at other restaurants over the years, and I have never experienced such superior customer service. Toni asked me to bring many of my decorations the day prior to the party and when I arrived on party day, the patio already looked amazing. As I worked to set up the additional decorations, several staff members kept popping up to assist. I never would have expected this additional effort. Our server for the evening was Kelli and she was amazing! My guests were coming at her from all different directions with beverage orders and she was on top of everything. She is such an asset and so, so good at her job! Toni did such a great job setting up a lovely buffet with a couple different kinds of wings in a sterno, large bowls of salads and different pizzas. The food was so well received by my guests that we had to re-order a few different times. Toni stayed all over this for me and kept checking what I wanted to do so my guests never had to wait long for more food. Their pizza is delicious, the salads were yummy (we had garden salad and mandarin spinach salad) and the Giovanni wings were a huge hit. I received so many compliments on what a great party it was and what a great selection Santisi Brothers had been. I noticed people walking past the patio also commented on how great everything looked and that they would keep that spot in mind for their next big celebration. I know I will for sure bring more business back to them and would love to work with both Toni and Kelli again. Huge Thanks to Toni, Kelli and everyone else at Santisi Brothers for making my daughter's special occasion such a wonderful, perfect evening in every way!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place to watch your favorite sporting event or game you need to check out Santisi Brothers. It doesn't matter what game or event you're looking for, they will have it playing somewhere. I'm a Browns fan so sometimes it is hard to find a place that actually plays our games on TV. But they have over 100 TVs so I'm always able to find our game on a big screen somewhere. Sundays are the best. The place is packed with enthusiastic fans cheering and having a good time. There is a lot of space and seating but on Sundays it fills up fast so be sure to get there early and stake claim to your spot. The food is great and not like your usual bar food. They have great pizza and Italian dishes and sandwiches. And the Giovani flavored wings are amazing. The drinks are cheap and the service is fast. They have a great Happy Hour too. They also have a game room with pool tables, darts and other fun activities so it's not just a place to watch sports. There is plenty of parking. They also have an outdoor patio with TVs and a lot of seating. There is two full service bars and the bartenders are quick. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"having recently moved here from near Old Fordge Pennsylvania, dubbed by national media as \"the pizza capital of the world\", i was a little skeptical on what the pizza scene would be like out west. after hearing some pizza-horror stories from local friends who have ventured out, it didnt look good.   i found this place after seeing it voted as best pizza in phoenix and was definitely surprised at how good it was! i feel a slight sense of relief knowing that despite seemingly popular opinion, theres still some killer pizza in AZ, and this place is it!   only con, pizza is slightly pricey. i paid $13 for a medium plain pie."}
{"text":"First off... The Wings rule.  The Giovanni ones are amazing.   Chicken tenders are legit too.  Love the tvs. Only complaint... Charging for ice tea refills????  Really.... Ice tea refills?  Come on santisis, lamest thing I've ever heard....I'll order water from now on, bring my own bag, and tea bag my water myself.  If you are gonna charge for ice freaking tea refills, which no other restaurant on the planet does, your servers should at least let your guest know. It's only 3 bucks, not a money issue.  Definately the principle.  I'll be back, cause like I said.... Wings are legit."}
{"text":"Went today with a friend while our wives were at a bridal shower, and everything was perfect! Great wings, great pizza, great service, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food! If your looking for a place to hang out with friends and catch a game....look no further!"}
{"text":"Let's start by announcing this is one of my FAVORITE Friday night hot-spots. We always sit at the bar. Maybe our familiarity with the flawlessness that is Friday night at the bar at Santisis is where the problem lies. Went there today for Father's Day and the seemingly warm waitress pointed out, \"You got here at the same time everyone else did!\" I candidly replied, \"we BROUGHT them all here ;)\" with a playful attitude. At first it seemed harmless enough, our initial beer orders were handled with grace but the food was a bit delayed given the crowd- as I said we are used to the Friday night bustle with one bartender, Debbie, who doesn't even sweat with the craziness. We got our food, the server seemed put out and when my fiancé politely asked for another sauce as the bartender's leisurely replied, \"you're going to have to give me a minute, you only ordered two.\" And I get it-it may sound petty but it was a kind request returned with hostility. I understand you're busy. Santisi is busy because the food and drinks are amazing! And in general the service is too. So I let that one slide. About the time we were about done eating about ten minutes later, the bartender brought the sauce my fiancé requested- without eye contact or verbal response. Twenty minutes later I decided to place my payment up for grabs. No one had been by to ask how the food was, If we would like more drinks or if we needed anything else. Sitting at the bar usually means attentive service, however today this was not the case. I was frustrated at being ignored so I put up a \"went outside for a smoke\" paper on my bar spot. We had a few chicken strips left which I wanted to bring home but, again no one had offered to help. I sat outside and finished my beer in peace and upon my arrival to the bar the bartender informed me I wasn't  \"allowed\" to go outside without leaving a payment/card. I thought this was ironic and explained to her that I had been trying to pay for a bit and was ignored so I went outside where it was quieter to drink my beer. Let me yet say that I was standing up for the waitresses' attitude until this point. I was a server for over seven years in my past life, I understand what it's like to be busy. Nonetheless I was frustrated, as was my fiancé, as we were not accustomed at all to this treatment. At the end of the transaction the bartender remarked that I had lost my partner, I felt no qualms about informing Nancy that he had left because he wouldn't tolerate her rudeness. She seemed put off and apologized for being busy. I explained that I was accustomed to visiting Santisi on Friday nights, when it was WAY busier than today and that Debbie never seemed to have an issue. I commented that maybe she wasn't suited for such a busy atmosphere- she replied \"thank you\"."}
{"text":"Went to Santisi Brothers for the Super Bowl, it was GREAT!! Flat screens everywhere not a bad seat in the place. The food was excellent, perfectly cooked wings with many different flavor choices and the service was OUTSTANDING!! Thanks to our server Michelle Mathews, The place was packed, she was really busy but we never had to wait for anything!! Best sports bar ever!!!  Thanks,  Mike Doyon"}
{"text":"I usually like this place but night the service was bad and the pasta with sausage was not edible. The sausage tasted like fake meat and the pasta was over cooked and mushy. Very disappointed. The server seemed irritated and very inattentive."}
{"text":"Tons of TV's and really nice servers. Took care of my family who were in town 4 different nights on our trip with tables of 12 to 15 people. The food is really good and they are great!"}
{"text":"Quick update to this post. Toni Santisi reached out as a result of our review and her genuine interest in our satisfaction was very much appreciated."}
{"text":"I must say I am very impressed with how our complaint was handled. I couldn't have asked for better service"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Was staying in a hotel nearby while visiting for a job interview and it was the closest place to watch the 2012 bcs nat championship game. over 100 tv's, great staff, and outstanding food. If you live in the area and havent been you havent lived period."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go hang out with a bunch of friends.  I probably wouldn't go there just to eat dinner."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now.  First time I had the 4 mini beef hotdogs.  If you like hotdogs try these.  I love that they toast the buns.  The service was not the best this night.  Dishes and empty glasses were left on the table while many servers and busboys walked right by them. I went again for Sunday football after seeing all the t.v's they had and being from MI it's hard to find a place to watch the Lions play that has decent t.v's. We sat up to the bar and Nanci was the bar tender.  EXCELLENT service! She explained quite a few of the menu items and drinks I ate the half order of sausage and peppers and onions.  WAYY too much food but so tasty.  My husband had the mediterranean pizza and was impressed with the crust and flavor of it all.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Coldest beer in town!  Santisi Brothers is the hands down best place to watch sports.   Week after week we get fantastic service and delicious food.  Highly recommend the wings."}
{"text":"overpriced you definitely pay for all the tvs in there. Service was slow  almost walked out because no one came to our table the first 15 minutes we were there."}
{"text":"Always an awesome place to go! It's the only good thing going on in that entire corner.   The pizza and wings are bomb!"}
{"text":"I was at this establishment for a karaoke night. The food was good, the drinks were good, and the service was good. No complaints there.  As for the karaoke crowd that was there, I was VERY disappointed. A lot of people were comfortable with the N-word being blatantly  thrown out there over the microphone. It was as if this was the norm around there.   If that is the crowd that frequents this place then so be it. I do not think I will be coming back to this place any time soon.  Bottom line: If you have to question whether or not you should sing the N-word in a song...you probably shouldn't."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but if you're hungry definately get an order of garlic knots with marinara because service is really slow.  If you are a sports can this is the place for you if you are looking for a quiet dinner conversation go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Manager rudely came out after we spent 40$ saying the patio is not dog friendly when I had my service dog with me. I'll take my business else where."}
{"text":"Huuuuu Jass Sports Bar.  Ok, I normally don't care for sports bars but this one rocks my socks.  I discovered this place when I first moved to Phoenix and would get off at 11pm starving.  Holy cow they have awesome marinara!  I would order a stromboli or calzone and it came with a soup cup of marinara if you asked.  I could eat half and have breakfast in the morning.    This place has very equitable pricing especially during reverse HH.  Seriously huge beers for $5 and two-meal worthy dishes for around $10.  And then there is the most kickass thing of all... Buzztime trivia!  As previously mentioned I am not a sports fan.  Because they have oodles of televisions they always leave a few on Buzztime, yay!  To wit, there is an active unit of regulars who play so there is always a challenger available.  I don't think I have ever been in there and had to play alone for more than a game.  The servers are pretty good but there is one teeny-tiny mature bartender lady (can not remember her name) who has to be one of the best bartenders in the Valley as far as I am concerned.  This woman is amazing, she holds down a long bar, never gets a tab wrong and fends of weirdos with expertise.   Santisi's is a good place to meet with west-siders as you each have to come a distance but not too far and the experience is worth it.  Why not five stars?  I once got 2 bills pinched off me in the bathroom in a drunken state and I dislike the super-high speed bumps you must cross to head east on Bell from their complex or flip a bitch on Bell where it is 6 lanes wide.  Neither of these things will stop me from going there though."}
{"text":"If you want excellent service..... you have to seat with Leslie!! She's the best santisis has!! Definitely not like your typical boring server!!! The food here is also bomb! I haven't tried something that I didn't like so far.... A+++++"}
{"text":"For carry out you have to get the special 16 inch pizza and 36 wings they have it everyday carry out only for $35 unbelievably good"}
{"text":"First - as a sports bar, they are the BEST I've ever seen.  More TV's in HDef than can be counted.  And they were very accommodating, so that I could watch the SEC out on the west coast.  Now on to the wings.  As far a size, A, selection, B-, too many confusing/similar names, e.g.- honey-hot, honey BBQ, BBQ hot, Dino's BBQ, Gio's BBQ, etc.  Plus, the waitress couldn't even explain the difference. I got the Gio's & the Med Buffalo.  Now for the biggest complaint - as with all places that do this.  Minimum of 10 wings per flavor, no exception.  Even during their $0.55/wing special, I have to get 40 wings to try 4 of their sauces.  Sorry, I can't waste that much food/money.  Why is it so hard to throw 5 wings in a bowl to toss?  The Gio's tasted good but weren't real distinctive, like corn syrup and Frank's combined.  The seasoned fries were crisp & flavorful but not 'fresh cut'.  Lots of great beers on tap, with a friendly staff. My search in PHX continues..."}
{"text":"I love this spot- one of my favorites for football watching and adult beverages. Ashley is my girl- best bartender ever."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch sports! Did I mention that the food is fantastic? Pizza and Calzones like my best friend Vito makes back in NY. I see some of the other comments about the lousy food or service and don't get it.    I have been many times since moving here last summer and have not encountered an issue with staff or food. Just watched UFC 155 this past weekend and our server was great & hot as hell (Allisha) even though it was busy as hell. 32 oz. drafts for $5? all night long...are you kidding me?? I will be back this weekend for the playoffs for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this place out while on a work trip in Phoenix. Wanted above average bar food and good beer selection. I had the 10\" Meatza pizza. The crust was a bit undercooked but everything else was great. Loaded with meat. Side salad was fresh & good. I tried several new beers from their decent selection. They were served in huge mugs ice cold.  There are tons of TV's in this place so you can see pretty much watch any game available. The bartender was friendly and very quick."}
{"text":"Love santisi's, the best wings and garlic cheese bread in the valley. Been coming here for years and I love it. Never had anything bad here, except..a couple of dates."}
{"text":"Always like coming to this place. The food is good the service is great. Ashley is my favorite bartender. She is very attentive and always takes care of me and my friends. Drinks are always filled, she makes conversations which is a plus. Overall this place and ashley are great."}
{"text":"What a great place, its big, a bit loud, but so much going on. The kids can play trivia or other games.  The food is really good, the meatballs are homemade! But its the services that makes it great.  The servers there are friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Best sports bar ever! Thanks to John S., I will never eat wings anywhere else again... Their Giovanni wings are the best wings I have ever had.  Keep up the good work Santisi Bros!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Santisi for my birthday and it was a great experience.  The food was great, love the chicken sliders and wings! Lindsey was our server and she was the best! Very friendly amd attentive! We'll be coming back soon, ill definitely ask for Lindsey again too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Went for Super Bowl Sunday. TV's everywhere!  Service and food ~ excellent!"}
{"text":"Santisi Brothers is a great sports bar with hundreds of screens to watch any sporting event you can possibly imagine. The service has always been great, the food is quite good for bar food, and we will be happy to be repeat customers. By the way, the portions are huge and the prices are quite reasonable. Wings are delicious, my son loves the burgers, and the philly cheesesteak is quite good. I have also had the chicken parm sub and it is good, but not saucy enough for me so a little dry. Not a big deal as all the food is of good quality, much better than the majority of sports bar food that you will find in other locations."}
{"text":"Edit: Nancy is rude!!!!! Just got back from grabbing food and beer. Don't think I'll ever be back on a Sunday afternoon.   This is probably my favorite bar. Huge menu, everything is good. Never thought a bar could deliver such amazing dishes. Drink prices are good too. DEBBIE IS THE BEST BARTENDER EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff. This place is PACKED when football is on. It's tucked away in the back of the \"mall\" parking lot... but its easy to get to and plenty of parking. I like going for the Thursday or Monday night games when its not as crowded."}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me.  They have TONS of TV's - perfect for sports.  They have a restaurant & a bar so you can have your cake & eat it too. Avoid karaoke night....bad bad bad.    The bartender was awesome. She made great drinks and didn't hold back on talking to is about the night.    Best waitress was Lacey.  If you go,  you will want to sit in her area.  Your drinks will never be empty, food hot/fresh & nothing but good things.   I got the gluten free pizza with xtra cheese: sauce was seasoned well so I couldn't tell it was gluten free.  We also ordered the artichoke/spinach dip- the bomb!!"}
{"text":"Grimy and grungy bar and questionable patrons. Came here on a groupon and the waitress AND manager argued with us regarding its validity on takeout orders. We had verified on the group in that it was in fact good on takeout. They had no idea what they were talking about. Wouldn't have stayed for dine in due to the disgusting floors, tables, crumbs on the bar and did I mention annoying drunk customers everywhere?  Logic would urge that a business amongst a neighborhood of failed businesses would up the ante on the demand for decent customer service. Other than that, if they cleaned the place up it would be mediocre. A lot of tvs, trivia, and the food smells delicious so far. But overall I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"This bar is great!  The people vary. There are ages 21-60 on the bar side and families an kids on the restaurant side.     They have an internet jukebox though it's overpriced :(  and too many people play crap. TONS of rap!  Food is great and drinks are good! I love the wings there. The chicken strips are great too!  yummy!  Lots of cute guys and girls to look at! The atmosphere is pretty cool so people don't tend to get pissy if you talk to them!   It's so fun to watch the UFC fights and its the best when Suns are in playoffs but they play all sporting events."}
{"text":"We visited here for large group gathering- the experience left much to be desired considering we spent approximately $600- we will look elsewhere the next time for a friendlier and more accommodating establishment."}
{"text":"Food's way better than I expected from a sports bar, great specials and drinks, plenty of options and televisions to pick from, pool tables, darts, karaoke night, clean too. I'm a fan"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, the pizza especially, and huge salads. This is the best place to watch sports. Our server was very accommodating to put MY team, BOISE STATE, on one of the big screens. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would say 4 stars because they don't have fried zucchini like the menu says!!! The reason for 5 stars is the food is great and Erica is one of the best servers I have ever had hands down!! I will be back for sure just because of her, but they really do need to get the zucchini problem fixed haha"}
{"text":"This place has two walls of floor to ceiling tv's, two bars, an area for pool and darts along with lots of tables and high tops.   I've mainly stopped in for karaoke, but they have a great menu. The pizza and wings are good. Drinks are well poured, and I've always gotten good service at the bar. You will see quite a few regulars if you go enough. They have a good sound system for karaoke!  Great place for good food and good times!!"}
{"text":"They have a million tv's! You can watch any type of game here. The service is most of the time good, it is a sports bar, so Im sure it gets very busy a lot of times, although I have never been there to witness it myself.   Never tried the food, but the drink specials are good. They have a good selection of beers, not so many craft beers, but a lot of domestics. Their happy hour is till 6:30 which is great, and they have happy hour drink specials as well as food specials.   We will come back here, but its not a place I would tell someone that they HAVE to go to...seems like a good hangout for a lot of epople though, I noticed that there seem to be quite a few regulars who show up each night."}
{"text":"Come on Santisi's !!!! $25 for 1 large pizza? You guys are effing CRAZY! It's not that good! Geez! I had the white pizza, which is tasty but $25!! Hell no!! Never again, lesson learned!!! Next time ill go ANYWHErE else and get 5 pizzas for that price!!!"}
{"text":"The Good: The pizza was incredible. I'm from NY and I take my pizza very seriously. The NY hand tossed pizza crust was nice and doughy, I loved it.  The wings were really good too, but the ranch was extremely watery    The Bad: The inside of this place looks like it hasn't been remodeled in 20 years, and there really is no theme to this place. I get that it's a sports bar but it just feels dirty and uninspiring inside. You walk in and there are these thin awkward tables scattered everywhere for you to sit.  The Ugly: the waitresses were the worst I've encountered in AZ. Throughout the 2 hours of being there, they never spoke once, even while taking our order, didn't smile, nothing. None of the employees wanted to be there.   Look this is Phoenix, there are thousands of great places to eat and drink on a Friday. The pizza is good and I'd definitely order for take out in the future, but I can't spend another second of my life inside this place."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty. In a run drown shopping center the place looked closed as well. The staff was not accommodating when asked to move from one side of the bar to another after we have been served our beverages. Pizza was not cooked completely and was so soggy in the middle. I wasn't expecting much from a dark bar but to have customers move for what reason and to be ignored for 10 minutes. Never again will this place take my money"}
{"text":"Good food. In town for spring training and wanted good food and good choice of beer. Pizza was good  and we found a couple beers we liked. Within walking distance of our hotel. A little too much visual stimulation but we sat at the right place for Spurs basketball (go Spurs!) and world baseball classic right next to each other. Good choice!"}
{"text":"Love this place they have great pizza and ice cold beer. They also have the MMA fights for free. Santisi Borthers is a family owned place and for how large it is you will get to meet and know the family."}
{"text":"Long time favorite. Food never disappoints. Lots of TV's. Bar is dark and can sometime be very crowded when you walk in. Go right, play some pool and be patient while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot in town SANTISI BROTHERS, never a disappointment. Great atmosphere. Friendly Staff with a smile. With a food menu where anything you choose is delicious.  you'll Thank me later!"}
{"text":"Looking for a sports bar?  Look no further. There's TV's on every inch of wall and then some. They also have darts and pool. The unlimited fish on Fridays is amazing!  Our waitress Nancy was awesome, too. Great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar to catch the game on a Sunday morning.  We arrived at 9:30 to grab a table, and I was amazed how many TVs they had on all the walls. Awesome. There's even a map on each table to show which TV will show which football game for both the morning and afternoon schedule.  Brunch buffet was alright. They had eggs, biscuits w/ gravy, breakfast burritos, sausages, pizza, wings, etc. Only until 11 though, then they offer the regular menu.  Had a couple huge beers while watching the game, and later needed a nap after the game. lol!! My sister got an appetizer sampler with sliders, wings, and fried zucchini. Mmm...delicious!  Service was really good as our waitress constantly brought me fresh coffee, refilled our drinks, and checked to see if I wanted another beer.  A great place to watch some football on Sunday. They even have free wifi so you fantasy addicts can keep up on all the latest stats. ;P"}
{"text":"Stayed at a hotel nearbye, looked for pizza in the area, Santisi had high reviews and looked great.  Made an order for a Pepperoni pizza and wings..   Picked it up, bar looked awesome, super friendly staff, more tv's than you could imagine.  Cant expect more out of a sports bar, good food, staff and entertainment.  If I am in the area again Im def coming back."}
{"text":"My neighbors turned me on to Santisi Brothers over a night of pizza and beer. Most recently I visited with my mom and hubby for a night of, well.....pizza and beer.   The food here is great, with a nice selection for vegetarians. Try the garlic knots! They are soft, tasty knots of dough served with tomato sauce. Mmm. Cheese pizza was piled with cheese and the dough was perfection.  Service was slow, but the waitress was super sweet and changed the tv to the game our group wanted to watch."}
{"text":"I\"m late in posing my review. We went there to watch an ASU game. Even though it was crowded our server was attentive. The chicken wings were awesome. The chicken strips were the bomb!. They were home made and not frozen. The had taste and were fresh. I can't say anything bad about this place. The ambiance is great and its entertaining to watch."}
{"text":"Always a good time..best food !!! ..service is always efficient and conistant ..I love the crab legs on Saturday ..such a great price for what you get ..lb"}
{"text":"Santisi Brothers ranks in my top five of all sports bars with exceptional food that I've been to in my life.  I've had the pleasure of touring their massive kitchen, which is very clean and organized.  Their extensive menu is loaded with great choices that you absolutely can't go wrong with.  Daily specials that you really want to go for, especially crab legs on Weds and Thurs. The Fish n Chips on Friday and the pizza, wings, baked ziti bar on Friday's is off the charts!  Worth the drive from anywhere in the valley to come to Santisi Brothers!  It's a great operation across the board, much Love and respect..."}
{"text":"This place is a TV Time Machine to the 80's.  Tons upon tons upon assloads upon bajillions of TV's in this place . . . sadly 95% of them are old tubes or old projection TV's.  Thumbs up though for how willing they were to change a TV to the game you wanted.  Not much for outside patio TV's though.  I think three total, and poorly angled.  Angel matters.  The food was standard bar fare.  The wings though were excellent, some of the best I've had . . . well cooked and plenty of sauce.  Service was great    Nothing I'd go out of my way for, but if peeps were going and I was in the area I'd go back"}
{"text":"This is just overall a great place! It's tough to do this review, as I can probably only remember 1/2 of my times being here, and that is being generous.  There's something about the atmosphere here that just makes you want to tie one on and knock back giant beers and spend money playing songs, darts, and Golden Tee. They also have pool and other games.  It's a BIG bar. There is a more \"game side\" and a more \"table/eating side\". They have a ton of TV's that are large and high quality. I have never seen it \"slow\" here. It seems no matter what the day or time it's pretty happening!  The food is really good. I love the diverse menu, happy hour specials, and quality ingredients. I also have never once had bad service. The staff is fast, friendly, and has never seemed irritated or overwhelmed.  There is a large patio out front that you can drink on that has misters and heat lamps (depends on the season).  This is the absolute perfect place to go have a blast with friends, or even come alone when you feel the need for a night out. Always friendly, attentive, and..... oops I forgot the rest because I always end up giggly and drunk. Sigh."}
{"text":"Overall i would recommend this place. Good for small groups and Sunday morning football."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying the baked ziti is the best i have ever had, and my mother is a first generation Italian American :0).  Major kudos on that recipe!  The wait staff is extremely attractive and friendly!  The owners are outstanding guys, you can tell that with in the first 5 seconds of talking to them.  The environment gives vegas sports bars a run for their money with the amount of TV's in the joint.  You walk in and are consumed by every live sporting event.  (thats a dream come true)  I live in scottsdale and will drive up every sunday to watch NFL games at Santisi!  Best sports bar hands down!    Coors Light is my beer of choice and they have $2.75 16 oz aluminum pints and $10 buckets of 4!  GREAT DEAL!"}
{"text":"We come here to watch the UFC because this place is very big and all the walls are filled with different sizes of TV from top to bottom floor. We order garlic cheese bread and that was very delicious, we also order a large Pizza that was OK. The only thing I didn't like is you only get just one refill on your cold drinks, but the good thing is the cups are pretty big so that was enough for me.  The waitress did the best she can because it was very busy.  We will be back in the future for the UFC fights and we drive from Tempe."}
{"text":"The WINGS made crispy or well done are my favorite in all of Arizona. The Athena dressing is amazing for salads. The grilled chicken breast and sautéed veggies are to die for. Also love the veggie basket. Chicken tenders are probably one of the best I've ever had. And the michelada beer is hands down my favorite in all of Arizona!!! I have to drink it with a straw so my lips don't go numb... so good! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. A great place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"Okay - Here's the deal. My wife and I have been going here since it's inception. I mean when they had a little deli take out counter! We were regulars for a long time and I would bring my family, friends, out-of-towners, even my work crew (party of 10-12) here for annual end of the year parties.  Unfortunately, the place is a shell of it's former self and our last several visits have confirmed it even more.   Food is bland, bland, bland. No salt or pepper, nothing. Wait times for food - not a Friday or Saturday - are ridiculously long. Staff is okay but, not even close to the awesome crew they once had.  We used to love the meatballs (now, bland, mushy & small), sausage (no color, flavor, looked boiled), Mama's lasagna - was heaven - now just sad, dry, & lacks flavor. Pasta shows up with dried reheated sauce (looks nuked). Chicken fingers - breading still great but, no flavor, none - unless you dip ranch sure but, come on - you have to at least salt chix, it has no natural flavor! Fries were great yet, it's fries so?  Writing this review breaks my heart like when Michael found out it was Fredo! I don't know who is left here that cares (John, Debbi, Toni)? Maybe the place was just was so successful for so long, they have forgotten what got them to the top.  After or last visit, we have to turn our backs to ya! Santisi Brothers as we once knew it is long gone...nothing lasts forever I guess."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great wings and an extensive menu of sandwiches make this a great place to visit. Large selection of tap beers as well.  The ultimate sports bar with tons of tv's and just the right vibe.  My only issue is the service as the waitress who served us never followed up after meal was served.  I have read other reviews about service as well and I am surprised the owners have not yet improved upon this issue."}
{"text":"Had a good time, good food, and the music-bingo was fun as well.  Ashley Nicole was a standout server...timely and efficient. Mike and I like the spot. Plenty of tv screens."}
{"text":"I love santisis. Such an awesome place. Always come with friends for the amazing Stromboli. Takes awhile to cook because it's made fresh. Such a good local bar. Idk what this Tatiana chick is talking about.. I've had Marcela as a server before and she's been great. I used to be a server and I know what good service is and that's what I get here. Usually at a bar it's a hit or miss, but santisis knows what's going on! Great food, awesome drinks and great service. Now that I live down the road I'll be coming here more often!! Gotta get my Stromboli fix! Good job santisis!"}
{"text":"Driving home from the far northwest valley, I spotted the sign for Santisi Brothers from the freeway and told my husband what awesome pizza and oysters they had.   I guess I should mention the last time I was at Santisi Brothers was about 9 years ago. Back then, they did have great raw oysters--huge and succulent. I don't know when they stopped serving them but I was very disappointed tonight because that's what I really wanted.   I remembered the pizza as being right up there with some I've had back east. What we had tonight (the 10\" cheese pizza--which by the way is the best test of how good a pizza is if it can stand alone with no toppings) was only a step above Domino's to me. Maybe the thin crust is better but I didn't feel like spending an extra $4.00 to find out.   The one bright spot was the Philly Cheese steak. They got the steak, cheese and peppers just right. The roll was a little doughy to me but I have high expectations for a cheese steak since I grew up outside of Philly.   The service was good and if you are a sports fan, you can't ask for more games on more TVs. I could have done without the screaming Oklahoma fans a couple of tables away though. But it's a sports bar so I don't hold them accountable for the fans there.   Santisi Brothers, if you read this, I am begging you to bring back the oysters. Maybe then the drive from the east side would be worth it. Otherwise I can find so-so bar food in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Santisis has been around forever and a day.  I've been here numerous times over the years.  The service has always been good and the place has a shit ton of tvs.  There's nothing to compete with this place in the near vicinity so if you are looking for a sports bar and are in the area this is your best bet.  The beer menu is average.  You got all your garbage domestics then a couple rotating local breweries and a rotating IPA.  If you are a real craft fan it's not really the best selection on tap or in bottles or cans.  The food is okay.  The wings are tasty but tiny.  The pizzas are average and the subs are probably the best of the items off the menu I have had.  The value of Santisi's happy hour specials is abysmal.  There are only a few items and it changes depending on the day you come in.  Come in on a Friday and you can get a buck off some fried zucchini.  Gee thanks!  You can usually find a toddler or three running around the bar.  Who takes their 3 year old to a sports bar?  Get drunk at the trailer park mom and dad.  Adults are trying to enjoy a beer and a game here.  There is also a patio out front in the sun with the misters facing the sidewalk instead of the patrons so if your dumb ass still smokes and it's summertime prepare to fry."}
{"text":"Great place. Visiting my brother and meeting the locals made this place a must visit.  Service is top notch.  I felt like family going here. Keep an eye on Ken Not Yee for me. Thanks"}
{"text":"I had posted a review last night out of frustration that my service wasn't so good but I will say that John one of the owners called me today and took care of the situation.  I really appreciated that.  Just because the service was bad I won't knock the entire establishment.   Thanks John!  We will be back."}
{"text":"We love coming here and having karissa and lack serve us on saturdays. Delani and Debbie are fantastic too. All of these girls make the experience for us at sant is brothers. They are attentive and make sure that we have a great experience"}
{"text":"I've been here far too many times. Good food, decent service and the prices are fair. Great place to watch any sporting event with the dozens of tv's all over the place."}
{"text":"If you want an atmosphere of TV-drenched and jersey wearing monotony this is your place. This is NOT my place.   As usual, they make up for the lack of decor and intimacy with very competitive drink specials and food items. Their service very personal 5*****stars for that!  The only thing special about this place is I am sure you can watch every channel listed on your Direct TV \"guide\" in one place. Seriously... why soooooo many TV's?  Do they get an influx of patrons during prime sporting events? Are they trying to compete with Best Buy in the TV department? oh well, everybody needs a niche.  NOte: Be careful of the random drunk guy trying to slide his chair to your table.      R\_"}
{"text":"Great sports bar, they have pool tables & darts as well.  They must have about 100 TV's in the place and they get extremely busy during football sundays, ncaa tourney, etc.  Great food and the prices are very reasonable.  Please note, the place is dark inside, not a single window, just an fyi."}
{"text":"Best sports bar in town bar none.  Great food.  Golden Tee.  Dozens of TVs.  No reason to watch a game anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Tons of tvs, drink specials and food specials daily, great place for big groups, small groups, smoking, darts, pool, poker tournaments. You name it! This bar has it all! If I were to own a bar it would be very similar to this place!  The food.... is outrageous! Portions are huge, food is GREAT! Even just a basic Caesar salad is delicious. If you get anything with fries be prepared for a mountain of them! The chicken tenders are out of this world! A must try! With honey mustard and ranch! This place also kills Italian dinner! Fettuccini Alfredo is out of this world. Don't let the prices intimidate you. Just about everything is sharable!"}
{"text":"The meatballs are a new favorite at this sports bar. You can get them on sliders, a hero or as I did with pasta. The dinner was about $15 and includes salad with a good blue cheese, garlic knots and choice of pasta. The angel hair is always one of my go to pastas. They load the sauce on and it does contain some garlic, but a good marinara. Manja!."}
{"text":"Good food. Screens everywhere. Service is hit or miss... TIP: The bread knots are ah-mazing! You can order a half order that is PLENTY for two people."}
{"text":"First let me say this is another case where I wish Yelp had a half star option.  If this were the case I would be placing this at 3.5.  I discovered online that this sports bar held a free poker league with potential entries to the WSOP.  Since there would also be playoff football I was sold and ready to make the journey.  Location:  I did not include this in my star rating, but the bar is located next to a discount movie theater in hat seems to be a run down strip mall.  Cool with me, but I could see some being taken aback.  Ambiance:  The inside was a little divey.  You can tell the place has been around for a while.  There was a noticeable smell.  As you got use to the place it disappeared but it was like a stale beer smell.  There are tons of TVs.  I can see where some would experience sensory overload.  Probably be better with less TVs that were a bit larger.  If you are a poker player they did have little poker tables which was cool.  Also all the fun bar games could be found pool, dart, etc...   Food:  There is a huge selection of offerings.  I did a sampler mix.  The mozzarella sticks and garlic bread where fine.  I'd say it is in the average range for bar food.  I definitely would want to try the pizza next time I go back.  Service:  There is a lot of staff.   All were friendly to me.  I was able to tell at times there was confusion with other patrons.  Let me say though this place was packed.  This was the busiest I have seen a sports bar since I've moved here.    Price:  For me this was maybe one of the biggest negatives.  When I compare what I had to quite a few other local establishments it was pricey.  I'd say each time was about one to two more (beers and bar apps) then what I would have hoped to pay. I'm by no means a tightwad, but since the ambiance is not amazing it was not as if I was paying for the experience.  Overall:  I went on an insanely busy day so I also dealt with a wide range of patrons.  The crowd in parts was rough which may have jaded my experience a bit.  I think I'd sit out on the patio next time.  I do plan on going back for poker and to try something different.   It was an okay experience but I've had quite a bit better."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying I LOVE THIS PLACE.  However, last night was super disappointing.  Food was good overall with the exception of the BREAD TIE IN MY SALAD.  Our server made the manager aware however she never came over to address it but did take a whole $3 off the bill.  Not kidding.  Really, you're cool serving a bread tie IN a salad but can't come acknowledge it?   I also specifically asked for a cup with a lid for my 5yo, at least 2x, however the server still brought him a huge cup, ignored my third request for a lid again AFTER she brought the drink to the table.  Well, the drink, of course, ended up in his lap, plate of food, and all over my Michael Kors purse.  So that was super too.  Bad night Santisi.  Not your norm at all.  :("}
{"text":"kelli is the best server here. she so helpfull and nice,! best server iv ever had by far. i will ask for her next time i come in! you rock kelli!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saing the food is good, not great but good. But why I love this place is cause of the TV's and the atmosphere! I mean I can go and watch anything from football to bikini contests from soccer to water polo all at once!! They have so many tv's."}
{"text":"I joined my sister for a few drinks and food here a few nights ago. The food was great and the service was even better. A sweet little thing named Cara was our server. We kept her busy but she had a great attitude! Will be back again when we are on that side of town!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here ALL the time. The food is great and the service is AMAZING. We usually like to eat pretty healthy so we get the grilled chicken and sautéed veggies- SO good. The chicken is always cooked perfect, never dry, and the veggies get a nice char on them. Sometimes if we feel like splurging we'll get a pizza and wings. We've never had a bad experience here- Erica's always our server. She's so friendly, always happy with a great attitude, and remembers our orders. I bartended for 7 years at a local neighborhood sports bar and I know the importance/ appreciation when you remember your regulars' orders. It's always a great place to watch sports, even tho I keep seeing complaints about the \"small TV's\" around the larger ones are 32\"... lets be honest- how far away are you sitting? The furthest table from the small TVs are prob 12' away. Best sports bar in Phoenix, I'd say:)"}
{"text":"Can't ever go wrong when selecting a sports bar, great food, organized, and great staff members. The pizza is great and the wings are always on point. Pick one of the hundreds of T.Vs to watch"}
{"text":"I love this place. There are tvs everywhere so you can watch whatever game you want. The food is pretty good. Their buffalo chicken pizza is my fave from them. I love the amount of options they give you for draft. I love coming here to watch the games."}
{"text":"Best sports bar in the valley. Hundreds of tvs and really good food. The best wings anywhere. The staff is very attentive and remember you!! They have something for everyone here. Just a great place to stuff your face drink beers and watch sports."}
{"text":"Totally awesome atmosphere, been going for years. I remember when it was just a small pizzeria! Love the family, the staff and really love the meatballs! Televisions all over. Best place in town to watch a sporting event. Good prices, but the atmosphere is over the top. Play some darts. Eat great food. Great place!"}
{"text":"Used to come out here all the way from Goodyear to meet up with friends. I've had a lot of drunken nights here...so much I took a little break from it all :) It's your typical sports bar. Tons of TVs, $5 Large Drafts, Pool Tables and what not.   Friday/Saturday night don't expect the huge party scene...It mellow just how i like it. No nasty guys grabbing my ass or a line across the room just to use the loo. The very reason why Ii went there for my birthday.  I took one star off just because it took a little long to get orders in for drinks and food, but not gonna b*^ch about it. PS suicide wings are delish...and so are the fried zuccinni."}
{"text":"To be honest the pizza that I had was so so. The garlic parmesan french fries were amazing! The bar slash restaurant itself had a very cool atmosphere to it. They must have over 50 TVs play on all sorts of sports. Overall it was decent."}
{"text":"This place has to be what Buffalo Wild Wings was like in the 1990's.  I've never seen so many CRT TV's in one spot in my entire life!  I recently stopped by to watch the Suns successfully spank the despised Spurs in the first game of the playoffs, so that alone may add a star to this review.  Once you get past the fact the initial shock of how many TV's there are, the beauty of this place really sets in.  Each Table along the edge has it's own old-school big screen that as mentioned, is 98% likely to be tuned into sports - awesome!  25 oz beers were under $4 and really hit the spot - word to the wise though, don't order a 12 oz right afterwards because when you put the two next to each other, the 12 ozer will make you look super wimpy.  Food was great too - the pizza was some of the best I've had in a bar, and really revived my appreciation for the classic beer/pizza combo!  All in all - great place to catch a game (any game!) and some beer with food that goes good with beer!"}
{"text":"best sports bar in town!! Love the staff and the food is the best!!! If you haven't tried this place you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"The food ad service is great.  The kitchen does an incredible job with all the food.  The menu is vast and all sauces and food is made onsite.    Try the grilled zucchini aa a side it is very tasty.     This place is big, but they get it done.   If you want a quiet atmosphere sit on their patio.    I really like this place."}
{"text":"Most of the time we like being here. The chicken strips are great. However, the service has been getting bad. The wait staff is lazy and never asks if we need anything."}
{"text":"I love Santisis.. great place to enjoy a beer. My wife really loved it when kaci is working. She's awesome.. we always have a great time when she's bartending... kaci is the shit...love you"}
{"text":"To greasy for me but its pretty dang good.  My bf loves this place, it can get very packed and unpleasant. Cool sports joint and awesome nights for kareoke"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a bite and some libations after a crappy action movie at the cheap theater next door. Definitely a sports bar - TVs everywhere - a bit overwhelming at first. The server was adorable. And an idiot. But that's okay. Sports bars value hot over competent. I know this, I can accept it. When I order \"Makers. Rocks, splash coke with a water back\" at a BAR, I shouldn't get a deer in the headlights look. She wrote it down word for word - then I had to ask again later for the water. That said - the food was better than I expected - and I'll admit the menu was more extensive than I would have guessed walking in. We shared the Italian nachos, a couple sliders, and other various fried things (sorry - I was on mental vacation that night, and the Maker's Mark was doing what it is paid to do!)  I don't think I'd ever come out of my way to make Santisi Brothers a destination. But for a night of cheap movies and a bite to eat with cocktails - I don't think I'd say no!"}
{"text":"Really fun place. Food is good and service is good. It's a guarantee that you'll be watching something you like with all the TVs available"}
{"text":"GREAT place to catch the game...well any game really. It felt like there were 3001 TVs in there all playing something sporting related.  The beer selection was good and the food was better than most sports bars I have been to.  When hockey season starts, this very well might be my pick to watch the Blackhawks have another AMAZING season! :)"}
{"text":"UGH! Really want to rate this place higher but after this weekend I just can't do it. Sitting in front of a TV, waaaay before the game starts, decked out in our team's gear head-to-toe, the d*ck manager walks in front of us and changes the channel so that the TV we're watching is on the SAME channel that 14 other TVs are programmed to and he was so kind as to move our game to one of the teeny tiny TVs. We asked if he could please change it back - he literally looked at us and said 'No - you can move though.'  Maybe he doesn't like a bunch of women sucking down brewskis watching football? Too much sexiness for his bar? LOL   His loss, and Santisi's too ...   Other than that - the wings are good, beer is cold, and patio is fun."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. The food we got was very good, flavorful and large portion sizes. Wings were don't perfectly.  Downfall, I asked for a couple craft beers they had on their menu but we're completely out of them."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment 3 times and each time I have been disappointed with the service. Great wings and decent drinks but the wait staff is HORRIBLE ! Yesterday I went to Santisi's for Sunday afternoon football, wings and beer, after waiting 5 minutes with no service, I got up and asked the bartender if my table could get some service. I was told someone would be right over. Another 10 minutes went by and still no service, again I asked if my table could get some service, and once more I was told someone would be right over. After about another 5 minutes we got up and left and went to an establishment that acknowledged our presence and provided service. Sad thing is Santisi's wasn't that busy !"}
{"text":"So we started out having fun for a good friends birthday. Ate, drank, sang .... Until at 9:00pm we were told we were too loud and must leave. No pre warning. No nice letting us know we may have been disturbing \"hockey\" while we were singing.  No, we were not obnoxious. No we were not mean... Just hanging with friends on our way home from the D Backs game . I drove 300 miles to get here and was kicked out for singing too loud.! I own a business myself and will never recommend this place again. Really the only thing good was Norma our waitress who tried to help us. She new we were just a happy small group having fun!! Will not be back"}
{"text":"I've only ever been during NFL football Sundays and it's PACKED!! Which is fun but make sure you get there between 9:15-9:30 to guarantee yourself a table where you can actually see your game!  They do have a TON of TVs, although some are 13\" so you better sit close ;)  They have a breakfast buffet between 9 - 11 am until their kitchen opens.  The food isn't great but it gets you through the day.  Some good beer specials, which is rare on game day."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports, not a bad seat in the house. Food was great-loved the meatballs and sauce! Service was terrific too! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is everything a sports bar should be. Lots and lots of TV's...for one. I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time.  The drink specials are pretty decent. They're not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour.  The food is great! So far I've only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips. All of them were seriously delicious! These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but I've definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places. These certainly surpassed my expectations.  And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie. One of the best bartenders I've ever seen. She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks. And by great, I mean a good stiff drink that's not so strong that you can't taste anything else in it.  We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason. Do yourself a favor and stop in!"}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoy going here on Sundays for football.  Of course, I live the closest and have to be the first one there to get us a good table by the right tv's.  Food is really good, over 100 tv's, and battle for sound (so just because the Cardinals play during your team's game, doesn't mean that they will get the sound.  Bears' sound has won every time).  I'm not crazy about the service.  Sometimes we don't see our server for a really long time and no matter who we have, they almost never smile.  I know this isn't the most glamorous job, but \"fake it til you make it\".  At least pretend you want to be there.  Other than that, we love the atmosphere, some of the fans get too carried away, but that's okay.  It's pretty funny.    It's nice that they give you a layout of where all the games are going to be, so you know when you walk in, what table to get.  I like to get there at least an hour before the first game, so I have my pick of spots, plus if you land a table that has chairs with backs on them, you're golden."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. You always know what you are going to get. Good food, cold beer at a decent price and a great view of a TV. We watched all the Coyotes playoff games here and had no complaints. Not sure I would go here if not to watch a game, but when there is something we want to watch, this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating I am extremely picky when it comes to Italian food.  Lucky for them I didn't actually see any on their menu.  Sure it had names that could fool one into thinking they served some Italian style dishes what was brought to our table proved that to be a false belief.    If you're looking for a place to have a drink while sitting in each others laps then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Love this place! Drinks are big and strong, TV's everywhere and food is great and a good price! Try the mussels or meatball sandwich, pizza and garlic knots are also recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Until recently, I would have rated Santisi's 5 stars.  A ton of tv's, karaoke two nights a week and a HUGE bar.  Darts, pool, video games and music.  Good food... excellent pizza and wings, excellent appetizers and drinks.  Very entertaining.  Except for the meat market part.  Really not Santisi's issue, but it really is an issue.  I've almost gotten into like 3 fights because men are such assholes there.  The girls just ignore each other, which is fine with me.  I also am under the impression someone slipped something into my drink one night and I got damn lucky I left an hour after that drink at 830pm on a friday. (or so I was told by my friends I was with... I truly do not remember and I definitely did not have too much to drink... I am the first one to admit something like that.)  It could have been a lot worse for me from that place and I have refused to go back since."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice. Both times hamburgers. They were very good. Service was very good. Atmosphere was very noisy."}
{"text":"I just had Wings and White Pizza and both were the best I've ever tasted.  The atmosphere is fun, and even though it's crowded, my server named Michelle had it all under control. Great food, great service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Reasonably priced.  It changed my life.  Fun atmosphere, every wall is covered in TVs, expect it to be busy during sporting events!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and awesome atmosphere! Love watching football games here with friends."}
{"text":"One of the top 10 sports bars in Phoenix,  and the food is great. Good place to go to catch a sporting event, enough tvs to please any sports fanatic. The food is top notch. Have had one of everything on the menu over the years and have yet to get a bad meal.   The beers come in a gigantic, iced mug.   Be ready to wait for a seat if it's footbal season, place can get very crowded."}
{"text":"This place is every mans dream because it's a total sports bar with hundreds of tvs and great food good looking people.  They even have crab days.."}
{"text":"Love santisi brothers ! I grew up right around the corner from this place and have been coming here for years. Tons of tvs so great for games, good service, and awesome food. They have darts and pool tables which are in great condition. I would say the only downside is during the week they don't have a server that comes to the dart tables or pool tables so you have to go to the bar to get your drinks which can be a little annoying when it's busy. Other than that I love this place !"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices! The food portions are large and cheap during happy hour! Their regular menu is extensive and there's a lot to choose from. I was expecting more people to be there for Monday happy hour but it was not packed at all! Must try the Giovanni sauce!"}
{"text":"We come here about once a month, and despite it's dive strip-mall appearance, it's one of the coolest sports bars on the west side.  The pros: Lots of stuff to do inside, and the bar is bigger than it looks.  Plenty of televisions, and the beer is priced right.  Food is well above average for a bar.  Like, really good.  Pizza is one of the best in town.  Service on the inside is good, but a word of caution for those who like to sit on the patio... we have waited up to 25 minutes to be acknowledged out there.  So patio service is hit or miss (get a drink at the bar inside and tell the bartender to send a server outside).  If you want to combine happy hour with another good value, check out the $3 movie theater next door!"}
{"text":"The best sausage and peppers sandwich I've had...period...also, our bartender Nanci is one of the best around. Thanks for a great Sunday Funday!!!"}
{"text":"Went there a few nights ago , food was AMAZING ! My server was EXCELLENT I believe her name was Cara ! Made sure drinks were filled and checked on us at the right times ! Definitely will be going back !!!"}
{"text":"Hey Santisi Family & team. I am slow to update, but I just had to fill you in.  A few weeks ago I came in with my 2 nieces. It was quite early & I think it was a Tuesday. There was only a hand full of people at the bar. The bartender was extremely curtious & very patient as my kids wanted to run around & play video games and not tell us what they wanted to eat. Anyways, I ordered 2 orders of chicken strips & fries, a salad & sprites to share between us. First off, you have, by far, the very BEST tasting chicken strips I have ever tasted. Not kidding guys! The chicken was really juicy and the breading is very tasty & perfectly crispy.  I don't think they are the same as I used to get, but either way....whatever you are doing differently...keep doing it!  We absolutely Loved them! And, WOW... the portions were HUGE! We couldn't even finish one order of them.  Now, your Ranch dressing is so delicious that the girls only want it from \"'Tisi's\" & they want to eat it on everything! Lol.  Your BBQ sauce is great & mixed with the ranch dressing was quite yummy... Folks you have gotta try them together on a salad. I swear it was soooo good.  But, the Giovanni sauce is just so damn amazing that it can be poured on anything & everything! I eat it on my salad, wings, ribs, chicken breast dinner, even dip my pizza crust in it. You name it.... It's incredible!  So, can't you bottle this stuff?"}
{"text":"Love their wings! Great service. One of my favorite sports bars in the Valley."}
{"text":"Great food and a great place to watch multiple sporting events.   Calamari is consistently good, get the medium sauce, delicious!! Lemon pepper wings were spot on.   I've come here with the family also and never been disappointed.  Great place for dinner. Friendly and accommodating  staff just tops off a great night."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sports bar and grill in the valley!  The food is so incredibly good.  I have never ordered something that I didn't like.  Some of my favorites are there soups like the creamy chicken noodle and the southwestern chicken.  The service is top notch.  The wait staff is  prompt and accommodating.   This is the best place in town for sports events with huge screens everywhere.  I also have to mention that the white pizza and the giovanni pizza are amazing!  The giovanni sauce is a specialty and it is delicious on, not only this pizza, but the chicken and pork chops they serve as well.  It is the perfect blend of sweet and spicy!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar! Tons of TV's on every wall, pool tables, darts, etc.  The waitresses and bartenders are all very attentive and checking to make sure your glass is full.  The food was pretty good too.  Great pizza and the wings were tasty!  We travel to Glendale frequently for sports events and to visit family.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great wings. Delicious potato skins. $2.75 large drafts Sun-Wed from 10PM to close.  The best part about Santisi is the food and drafts.  They have friendly and cute servers and one sexy one.  Nonetheless, getting your first order can take awhile their customer service can be real slow at times.  The only negative is that their kitchen closes at 11PM except for Thursday - Saturday which is midnight.  Great food. Nice drafts. Friendly, cute and sometimes sexy female servers ?  Yay, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the fourth time in last four months...not impressed...we live in Idaho. We have had to make several trips here since October and have made it a point to eat here each trip. Twice this trip. This is a lot more than pizza/sports pub. All the food is really good. The Clams Bianco(hope that is right) is to die for. Best clams we have ever had. Wings are as good or better than any I have had any where(recommend lemon pepper). Oh and by the way their Pizza is fantastic as well.  Service is top notch. Jessi, Tanya and Nanci were so nice and gave us great service even though they are always busy. Feel horrible we forgot our fourth servers name, we think her name was Alex. She was fantastic as well. The big cold mugs of beer round out your experience! For you none beer drinkers they have some fun drinks. Can't wait for next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I love wings, absolutely love them... and you can tell how much i love them by my pictures... anyways, Santisi has awesome wings..  The atmosphere can be a bit creepy at times and pretty dark, they have ton of TV's all tuned towards some sort of sport or game. Usually there is a lot of seating unless their is some sort of big game going on or its Friday night.   The food there is awesome.. Great/awesome wings, the ribs there rock, the pizza is awesome too. The beer prices are good, and i reasonable. The waitresses are mostly hot, and really nice. Out of the 20+ times I've only had one \"interesting experience\" there (and no it didn't involve little people).  I would definitely recommend this place.  One note. Although it's a kid friendly bar, i wouldn't recommend bringing your kid there."}
{"text":"Tonight was in unfortunate night. My son who served in the US Navy tried to play a game of pool. The table he tried to  play at was occupied by someone who didn't understand the rules of pool. My son went to get more change for the table which I'm sure is on their video...  he came back and his quarter was moved off the spot he had placed it. When my son said I play winner the other guy said no I'm playing with my girl and my son told him the rules are next game I play winner. The other guy said no and my son said no that's not how the game is played I put my money down I play winner. The other hey says no I'm with my girl you can suck my di@!  Yes my son got angry. Yes he said some bad things back but Jonny the manager who eventually came said to us just play at another table and let the guy and his girlfriend stay at their table. He did tell them my son was right and those are the rules of the game but that was it. We left and I later called to apologise for my son cursing but said I didn't feel what he did was fair. The man who was rude and insulting got to stay at his table but my son was told go play at another table. I didn't think it was fair and I told Jonny so. He said I've been working here 10 years and was doing my job. That's how we keep the piece and he started raising his voice at me when I said I didn't think it was fair or right to keep the couple at the table. I love this place. We go there often but I think he handled the situation unfairly and was rude to me and should not have raised his voice when all I said was I didn't think the situation was handled fairly. For someone with 10 years experience I'm sad to say he was rude and unprofessional and I just wanted to share that in case you ever experience something similar. Sorry Jonny you could have handled it better and you certainly didn't need to be rude to me."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in Phoenix! Nothing is better, it is worth the drive and I live far. Huge sports bar with TVs all over, you will never miss a thing in this sports bar. I have come here for years, lots of great memories and the pizza has been consistently amazing. Coke products here!! Just writing this review is making me crave this pizza. Reasonable prices and tons of room for everyone. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The wait staff here is very friendly, however, slow to get service... they may just be under staffed. We ordered wings here on \"wing night\" and it took 40 minutes to get them to the table - so long we ended up having to get them to go since we ran out of time before our next event. We were with a group and the one strange thing that happened was that we wanted to order a sub but the waitress asked us for a credit card for a tab... a tab when ordering food? We told her we'd be paying cash and could we still order when we pay with cash? She seems frustrated but ultimately took our order - weird. Anyway, it's a big place but if you go here don't plan for quick service... take your time, play some darts or pool and chill. Oh yea, it smells a little strange in this place. You won't notice after a few minutes but when you first walk in you'll get a musty greasy smell, meh... it won't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Always have a good time when we go here, gets freakin' busy during Happy Hours! HUGE selection of TV's! sooo many you dont know what to watch!"}
{"text":"This place is fun to go hang out and drink a couple. Has a wide selection of beers on draft and bottle. Food is awesome. Last time had pizza and wings and was really good. Friday night is fish fry that is awesome. It's all you can eat and they fish is big chunks and not greasy at all. Also had the pork chops , big and not dried.  This place is fun for family's or a night on the town. Tons of tvs to watch any sports you want."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I moved here in 2001. I've watched them expand and grow, but their food and service has always remained Top Notch. I will continue to come here as long as they are around."}
{"text":"First of all, I love this place. It never let's me down. All the Employees are so customer friendly, And the service is so personable.   I am a Professional and work long hours, and when I come here I am completely relaxed and taken care of. The Food is always top notch and so very good.  These guys do it right. Oh, by the way, the 100+ TV ' S don't hurt either.  Debbie, Delayne, Ashley are the Best Bartenders around. Tell them your drink of choice, and your name, i promise they will remember Highly-rated and recommend this place to Everyone."}
{"text":"Santisi Brother's has awesome pizza and the best calzone I have ever had. I can't eat them anywhere else and I crave one about once a week.  There are tons of tv's covering the walls in the main dining room so if you love sports and enjoy watching several games at once this place is for you. The only problem I have here is that the waitresses give better service if you are a guy or with a guy. Ayesha is right though there are always cute boys here! One offered to buy me a sea monster shot and I fell in love. Aaaah!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for the Friday $10.99 all you can eat pizza and wing buffet... And it was amazing! Love it!! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood bar and goto spot for friday fish fry. Kate is fantastic and always takes great care of us. With this being a sports bar, it can definitely get busy but the food is always on point, fresh, and the coldest beer in town."}
{"text":"It was my first time going, had a great time. It was a Friday night and they had us playing song bingo. I ordered the classic New York style pepperoni pizza with some hot wings. The food was really good. Great customer service, definitely going back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar, so it's loud, a zillion tvs, and a little dark. However, the food was that of restaurant quality. Had a meatball and tomato pizza with medium wings. Pizza was fresh, crispy crust, and the meatballs were yum! The wings were crispy and tasted like fresh chicken. Could've used a little more sauce, but I'm not complaining. I will definitely be going back for the delicious food."}
{"text":"Customers BEWARE.  This place will scam you out of your money when paying your bill. Visited this establishment for the first time, the bill was $40 and change and provided a $100 cash for the bill. Received $42 and change back. Where was the other $16? Gratuity was not added on the bill for them to snag the remaining MISSING change.  Just a heads up to patrons... I have the impression this is NOT the first time they have done this! I will NEVER return.  Awful experience."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times over the past couple of years.  I've been there when it's pretty crowded and mildly so.  It's a great place to meet before a high school football game on a Friday early evening.  It's exciting and electric with lots of sports athletic spectator energy.  The menu is varied and large with a seemingly endless selections of expected sports bar items all with an Italian flair.  I've only sampled their pizza, meatballs and a Cesar salad but it's all been quite good and delicious.  From what I've been told, this is a family operated establishment that still uses some of grandma's old world recipes and it tastes like it.  Good stuff.   They of course also have a wide variety of beers on tap and in the bottle along with a full bar.  The service is always friendly and efficient even when it's pretty crowded.  If you don't like televised sports and sports themed diners, then this place is NOT for you.  There are TVs everywhere broadcasting a variety of professional and collegiate competitions from mainstream to off the beaten path.  But, if you love an authentic sports bar with lots of energy and great food/drinks, then don't miss Santisi Brothers."}
{"text":"My Bro and I dropped into this bro spot (Santisi Bros) today for lunch. I've been here many times as it is right down the road from my neighborhood.  It's dark inside, so prepared to be blinded if you exit mid-day. TONS of TV's lining the walls, most tuned in to a sporting event. Good beer & drink selection and good food selection. Pizzas, pastas, salads, calzones, sandwiches and more.  Today I went with the eggplant parmesan sub and I really think it is the best damn one I have ever had. So damn tasty and perfect. Crisp bread with a soft inside, crispy eggplant slices, delish cheese. I don't think it can get any better. There pasta dishes are also HUGE, so be prepared. Santisi is a great neighborhood sports bar who happens to also make some damn good food. Recommended."}
{"text":"Best sports bar in town the food was fabulous and we love our waitress Ciara. She rocks.... we needed a place to watch the Vikings game. I gts viking bars and we ended up here. We will be back again and again. Thank you all for the great Service"}
{"text":"I'm from New SoCal and miss my family, food and cards. After being in Phoenix for 2 days, I found Santisi's by accident  when I stopped in for a quick lunch. The food, service and atmosphere were great so I kept coming back to practice my pool shots as I dined on Bruschetta and other Italian-fare. Then I found Santisi's hosted a Texas HoldEm Poker league.... this was even better, I missed playing cards with my friends and family. What really sealed the deal was eating my first Zeppole; a fried Italian donut that looks and tastes like a beignet from Cafe du Monde in the French Quarter. What more can I say? This is like home, away from home."}
{"text":"Busy and packed, you need to plan to get a decent seat here.  They sell more than the basics of beer, and the food is great.  I admit, I come here because of the friendly employees and the great beer.  It's not a chain style bar/Italian which makes it awesome in my book.  I don't talk to people and yet I can have a conversation with the bartenders here.  That's saying something."}
{"text":"Best sports bar I've ever been to.   And so lucky it is close to me.  I need to go more.    They have a variety of foods and so many Televisions,   You will be able to catch your game,  no matter where you sit.      I would say their Pepperoni pizza,   Mild or giovanni's BBQ wings,  and Italian nachos are the best.      Would definitely recommend for anyone.   I see families in there all the time.   Maybe not football Sundays for young children, just because of loudness.   And they also care about their customers.   Servers are always good,  and during football season they give away a bunch of free gift cards."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. You usually don't expect much on the taste side from a sports bar, but everything we had was very good. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet. Put up with about 20 of us hooligans! She was also ridiculously hot (freckles). She gave us a couple of places to go out that night, and even split ALL of our checks, which I was later informed that they have an old school check out system. They are all paper and calculators, so it must have been such a hassle to do that, but she did it with a smile! Great place!"}
{"text":"I have no idea where the great reviews come from. Maybe the employees. Cause what I saw and what I dealt with there is no way I would ever give this place a 4 or 5 star review. The servers seem to be lost and the other ones seem as friendly as a pest rattlesnake. I only had one drink cause it took forever for that one. Wasn't gonna see how long it would take for another one. The food didn't look good. Saw a party of 4 next to us get their food one at a time cause the waitress couldn't remember what they said to the time she got to the computer it was quite sad to watch and you could see the frustration on the tables face. I have no idea how this place has been in business this long with the waitstaff they have. Oh maybe that's why the turn over is so high. It might not be the staff but maybe management and owns that are the problem?  Never will spend another dime at this place again!!!"}
{"text":"It's just not worth it to go here. The service is a hit or miss - some waitresses are helpful; some are bimbos. The food isn't that great... you can definitely find better. The inside setup... well, we had to sit outside because of it. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great place for night life! If your single and looking to mingle you need to stop by here! I tried the chicken tenders off their menu and I am very impressed!! Probably the best chicken tenders I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Have been here to eat plenty of times and the food never disappoints. Everything I get on the menu I enjoy. They serve big draft beers which I enjoy. Service can be slow at times but for the most part the servers have positive attitudes. One of my favorite restaurants because the food is always tasty!"}
{"text":"I think my first visit to Santisi was in 1998, when it occupied the far south portion of the current space. It was a long, narrow shop run by two brothers that had relocated here from NYC. My friends and I would head over for lunch a couple of times a week because there was noone else ever there and it was the best NY style pizza anywhere near the office. The slices were huge, the cheese was just right, and the prices were cheap.  Well I guess we didn't really need to worry about them staying in business because it's 10 years later they have built one of the most amazing sports bars in the entire Phoenix area.  After acquiring the storefronts adjacent to them, they now have a spaceous location. If you like sports, and I mean any kind of sports, this is the place to head to for a group watch. They have over 60 screens throughout and if you don't see the match up that you are looking for, simply head over to the bar or alert your waiter/waitress and it will soon be up somewhere in the room. A couple of hints: 1) if you are going on a big game day, get there early - this place starts to actually rock with all the energy produced, and 2) if you are showing up with a big group, call ahead and reserve some tables - otherwise you may find yourself spread all over the bar.  The menu has grown substantially and now inlcudes several seafood options in addition to the standard pizza, pasta, and calzone offerings. When I visit, I usually get an order of wings (seriously the best in Phoenix) and a Mushroom and Cheese pie (because it's pretty close to one that I was addicted to in Manhattan), fold the peice up sammie style and let the grease drip down - YUMMO. Actually the only thing that I've ever had that wasn't pretty decent were the zeppelies. They are supposed to be delicate little fried, airy peices of dough dusted with powdered sugar, but these chew more like peices of bazooka.  They have a buffet at lunch, a dirt cheap HH, Poker tournies, trivia, a full service bar, reasonable prices on most of their food, and ummm have you ever seen 60 screens outside of Frys Electronics?!!  And for those of you interested in the softer sex, they have the Santisi version of Hooters girls, called.... you guessed it - Santisi Girls.  I have a feeling that if Tony and his gang would have looked for an alternative to the BadaBing, they might have opted for someplace just like this!"}
{"text":"Over priced and overated. They don't offer the level of service they used to here. The food is below what it used to be."}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's birthday last night and the only word I have to describe the experience is... Weird. I think there may have been only 10 girls in the place even though it was pretty busy in the pool table room, so definitely what my understanding of a \"sausage fest\" is.   The beer prices were okay, 3.50 for a pretty large mug of either Miller, Bud, or Ultra. I didn't eat, we just drank beer and fought for time on one of the two pool tables.   Overall, I think it was just not as cool as I was hoping for, and the crowd was a little shadier than I would have liked. The waitress was pretty surly, but I'm a server too and I think I would be just as off-putting if I dealt with that crowd on a daily basis.  I hear the pizza's pretty good so I may return during the day to try it, but I probably won't go again on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"It has been years since I was here.  Went today with some co-workers to celebrate.  Nice big spot that has 2 bars, 3 pool tables and tons of Tv's and Dart boards.    Waitress was pretty spot on with our slightly indecisive group of like 8.  I had the Chicken breast plate with fries.  The breast was obviously a frozen one but the cook and seasoning on it was good.  The seasoned fries are horrid.  I don't know what that seasoning is, but it's almost like parmesan cheese.  They were covered in it.  Overall it was not bad.  Good place for some happy hour."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of the food, but this is one of my favorite places to watch football. You can see any game you want at any location in the place."}
{"text":"If there is something on the television then this place will have it! There are tv's everywhere which is pretty awesome.  There is seating all over and a great place for groups of 15+ people.  There is a separate side for pool and darts where you have to be 21 which is nice.  They have good craft beer selections as well as awesome drink specials.  Their wings are so gwwooooood!  Holy buckets if you enjoy wings you need to try these!   Televisions all over for every type of game or event and great food and drink.  Not a bad place for the kids to enjoy a sports bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Friday 10/1/10  Everything was great but we used an Entertainment Book discount and the waitress screwed it up 2 times. The 3rd time it was within a couple bucks of being correct and the family was ready to go.   Watch your bills a little closer.    Saturday 10/2/10...dont judge me.  We started here for the bday dinner and a drink or 3. Glad I used DD'd  The waitress was brand spanking new, but did a good job. At least the bill was correct."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, LOVE the atmosphere with all the televisions.  The ONLY negative I dock it for is that they could definitely have better specials...which costs them a star, but everything else is great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!fun poker 3 days a week!!great food!!!great prices!!!even better people!!!!"}
{"text":"Santisi's is perfect. You can sit at the bar, sit at a table or booth- or sit on the patio with misters. There is food here - lots of excellent pizzas, and seafood! This place must have a crazy electric bill, so many big TVs everywhere. Beer is served in icy mugs mmmm The service is great and they pay attention to you.   UPDATE: watch your BILL! Mine has always run about 40/50 $ and one day I asked to split the bill. My 5.75 appetizer magically turned into a 9.75 appetizer because of the servers \"handwriting\". All this time we been paying it and givin high handy tips like mad. Now all of a sudden I realize they been doing all kinds of arbitrary math on me and my sister. Watch your bill and don't be ashamed to have it \"itemeized\". That shit is scandalous"}
{"text":"Honestly the BEST pizza and wings in the valley! Have tried almost everything on the menu and love it all.  Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's. Highly recommend Santisi!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza we've had since we've been here... and the best we've had in awhile anywhere! Thin crust, NY-style, well-done - simply delicious. What would make it even better? Anchovies as a topping option! What's with not being able to find anchovies in Phoenix!!??!  For $25 we got a take out special including a 16\" pizza and 24 of the most fresh and tasty wings. Each topping was +$2.50. Great value for an absolutely amazing meal. Get some anchovies and I'll find a way to give it a sixth star! :)"}
{"text":"Hung out here for Happy hour with some of my cousins and a friend.  The food was DELICIOUS! Our first waitress was very nice and provided great service! We started off on the main side of the bar.  After eating we ventured to the room with the pool tables.  We flagged down a waitress by the name of Karissa to order.  Karissa was extremely rude the whole evening.  I am not sure if she was having an off night but she answered our questions with smart a*! answers, kept rolling her eyes and when my cousin asked her for a bacardi and diet tall with a lime she told him he could order it at the bar.(I was like Wow! Really?!) Unsure why she was so snippy with us. We only ordered a few rounds from her and were never rude in anyway to her.  We complained to the manager who our friend knew and he said he would make sure it was dealt with.  He must have talked to Karissa because after that she wouldn't serve us. The manager also told our friend our complaint was not the only one of the evening about her.  Another smiling friendly waitress replaced her.This waitress was super sweet.  I think this place is a lot of fun and seems like they typically have great service. Just beware if you get Karrissa as your server hopefully she will be in a better mood if she serves you. :/"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from the East side of town. BEST sports bar I've ever been to. TONS OF TV'S great food, we had breakfast sandwich, wings & strombolis all were great. Owner has put a lot of TLC into the menu... wide variety of food types w generous portions. I highly recommend check it out sometime."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday on Friday.  We got the santisi combo and 24 wings.  I havent been here in years and the food is still good.  The wings were cooked well...crispy and not swimming in sauce.  The pizza is decent.  All in all I would eat here again."}
{"text":"So stopped by because we were about to watch a movie next door and started off waiting for someone to say oh you have to tell us your sitting outside before someone checks on you then after ordering drinks and food they delivered the garlic knots and asked if you wanted nothing I replied yes another round  after poking my head in and out of the door still no service they delivered our pizza and asked again but left before we could respond. Poor customer service and losing revenue because staff just doesn't care. Will think twice about ever going black would recommend going across the way to TGIF"}
{"text":"No stars is what in want to give. I came with a group of friends tonight and our server wanted to leave so we paid her and tipped. It tok 35 minutes for us to get another server after we asked at the bar and then the manager finally came over. And don't try to get a beer for your friends at the bar it's one at a time even if your group can be clearly seen by the bartender."}
{"text":"Great TVs good for sports. Good soup and pizza. Today I am trying the meatball pasta. I recommend this place for games."}
{"text":"Picture this:  Dad, w/my 2 /teen kids, looking to blow a Groupon on a Thursday night at a sports-bar themed place called Santisi Brothers.  Sounds easy enough, right?  Now, factor in Thursday Night Football (the kind where your cable bill is EXTRA to get these special Thursday night games so EVERYONE hits the sports bar/grill), and picture a tatt-loving, mostly smoking clientele, who flood the place and take all the available indoor seating.  So where does that put us?  ON THE PATIO...where smokers temporarily reside while leaving their reserved tables inside.  Nice way to show the kids a quality time, experience, take them to the smoking section...  So, kids, let's just sit outside here, watch the game on these nice HD big screens, kinda nice by ourselves...and the obnoxious cigarette smoke!  Clearly, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time (dad in bar w/kids during PM football)!   Yet, that being said, Santisi does a great job of making affordable beer drinking and eating good quality food while the layman gets his mid-week NFL fix.  The manager recognized how we stood out like a sore thumb (that is, a sore thumb enshrouded in cigarette smoke), and very graciously kept an eye on us and even provided complimentary desserts to my kids, who instantly became life-long fans of Santisi Bros!  The service (Alysia) was solid, punctual, and quite easy on the eyes, too! Pizza and Chef Salad were fresh, perfect temp's, and presented nicely.  I will definitely go back, but not with kids.  Nice staff as well, and they did their best to make the family feel welcome."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came by late one night for a quick drink.   This place was nearby in a strip mall and parking was abundant. It was pretty cold and late so I can figure why there wasn't many people here. Probably around a dozen and a half patrons plus staff.  We came in and the kitchen was closed sadly. However, they had a full bar and the bartender was pretty quick to attend. We got our drinks fast and never had to wait.   We grabbed a pool table and played a few games. The tables were clean and leveled correctly. The felt and sticks weren't used and abused.   There was a few guys that seemed kind of obnoxious but they were pretty drunk.   The cost of drinks were pretty inexpensive.   The place had A LOT of TVs. All flat panels. Most were mid sized but a few that lined a huge portion of a wall were decent sized...like 50\" or above. They had a few posters up advertising for their hosted poker night.   There is a patio there for outside drinking and smoking. There's a few TVs out there as well.   Overall, pretty decent experience. Didn't put a dent in the wallet between two people drinking. I wouldn't mind coming back here during earlier hours to try some of their food. From the looks of it and reviews, the place has some pretty good food."}
{"text":"They're open until 12am on sundays. When i goy here around 1030pm they told me they closed the kitchen at 10pm. So no food unfortunately. But got my drink and had no issue with that. The music on the other hand had me LIT. We left for food but will definitely be coming back earlier to enjoy the full experience (food and drink and music)."}
{"text":"Closed kitchen early because they were slow.  Manager \"Johnny\" is a loser. We had a groupon and he would not honor it.  Hate to say this but we would never try this place again even though we lost 17.50."}
{"text":"I'm a regular, I love it, and it loves me...  Can not go wrong with Santisi Brothers. It's usually packed, so get there early, and be sure to tip your waitresses!!"}
{"text":"This food is so good.  I had the fried Zucchini and my hubby had the Italian sub with fries.  He says it was very good.  This place is live and plays excellent music.  It is a fun place to eat and drink with  your hubby and friends.  Love the food.  I enjoyed playing  roll & rock bingo."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!!!!!! Ordered calzone with pepperoni delicious !!!!!!!!!!! Lost count of the number of tv's every wall has a bank of tv's covering it!!"}
{"text":"I I sat in there for like 20 minutes and couldn't get anybody to service me so I don't know what the hell you guys are talking about I will never go back to that dump again. They called the manager and she couldn't do a damn a damn thing. She told me she would have the bartender help me period while real customer service what a bunch of b*******"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Love the karaoke and the wings are so great. Staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"I really like this sports bar. Lots of TV sets and games running all the time. Karaoke nights on Saturdays i think, walked in and i was surprised. Tried their Italian menu and really liked it. They also have a good assortment of  alcoholic beverages, pool area and a casino i think. 1 star short because of the appetizers after 11 pm are not worth paying lol."}
{"text":"We have only been to music bingo but it is so fun, even if it consistently starts late. Deb is so friendly and a great bartender. She takes the time to mingle with everyone who sits at the bar and she is the highlight of every trip we have made. Have not tried the food but it always smells delicious."}
{"text":"I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night.  Yep, I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit.  We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know it's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.  For a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.  This is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were good.  Reasonably priced. Waitress was a little slow.  But otherwise a good experience.  Lots of tv's for everyone's sporty liking."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that this place is my favorite. Ashley R is AMAZING to say the least. I think their wings are HANDS down the best in the Valley. Ashley has always taken excellent care of me, and over time has gotten to know me. It's nice to walk in, find a table in her section and know she knows what I like and how I like it, and always makes sure my guests feel special. I would highly recommend Santisis for any sporting event; and Ashley R if she's availabke."}
{"text":"Good food not great. Good service. Cold beers. Good times. Great place to watch the games."}
{"text":"The most TV's under one roof anywhere.  This by far is the best sports bar in Phoenix.  Not only do they have a tone of tv's but the food is amazing.  I would go to this place if it had a black and white 19 inch TV just to get the food.  The owners did this place the right way, with the customer in mind!!  I will be a long time customer here till the day i die."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. Great atmosphere, excellent food and service. Can't wait to come back to watch some games and eat Amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Back in the day this was the place to be. Now the service is terrible and it doesn't matter how many TV's you have if you can get a drink."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood joint.  Great wings,  delicious pizza and super friendly service! Love that you can watch pretty much any game at any time here, there are soooo many friggin tv's!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot on Saturdays and love the service we receive from Kaci. She is fantastic and is very attentive. She makes our weekend .we love her very much. She even remembered when my birthday was and made me feel so special. She is one of the reason's we come to santisi brother's"}
{"text":"Great place to watch UFC, but get there early a lot of people get there hours before and camp out until the fight. Luckily we were able to get a couple of chairs at the bar. The food was great and there were special pricing for appetizers,  food, and drinks on a Saturday night, major plus. The 10 inch pineapple ham with jalapeños was the best I've ever had. Yum!"}
{"text":"TV's everywhere, good place to see everything!  Pizza was average.  Staff was nice and did a good job."}
{"text":"Soooooo many televisions! This place is March madness heaven. Getting the sound on for a specific game you are looking for is a bit of a challenge. Darts in the side bar is a ton of fun! Great service but prices of food and drinks are high. The price tag is the only thing that doesn't make this my home bar."}
{"text":"I love going to Santisis! First of all, it is in a very convenient location for me. The plaza it is in is kind of a dump, but it is close to my house and right off the freeway. Second, they have pretty good happy hour specials on drinks. They have huge beers at good prices...and they serve them in frost mugs! Last, there food is really good too. I love their pizza, wings, and salads. I have heard good things about their pasta too. They have lots of TVs to watch sports on but if you plan on going on Football Sunday, get there early or you won't get a spot!"}
{"text":"Big SPORTS bar, decent drink choices, ton of food choices, good atmosphere for watching any sporting event.  I tried to count all the TV's: approx 78 different choices to watch."}
{"text":"Love this place! A TON of TVs. There is no bad seat in the house. Great place to watch football and plenty of seating. They have a buffet during football season that is a great deal and you can get pizza, hotdogs, wings. Their drinks are well made and service is fast and amazing considering how packed it usually is here. Overall all the food we have tried on the main menu has been good. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the meatza pizza with bell peppers. And the sampler which included medium hot wings, angus beef sliders, and garlic knots. We waited about an hour for our food to come out. When it finally did, the sliders buns were really hard and the garlic knots were more wet and soggy than anything. The wings were pretty good and so was the pizza. Overall the pizza was the only thing hot, it was obvious the sampler had been made and sitting out for a while before it was brought to our table. I'm only giving 4 stars because I appreciate all the Available TV's and has a good atmosphere for watching sports. I don't think the food should be so pricey if the quality is so poor (the sampler cost $18.25). I didn't complain about my food because I had already waited so long and didn't want to bother waiting another hour."}
{"text":"I enjoy Santisi.  It is all boy and I love boys.    There are a gazillion TV's in this place, it is dark and cold, and the waitresses usually have some sort of fun tattoo or piercing for me to admire.  The food is also very good.    They have a good selection of beers on draft, my choice is usually a large Blue Moon although I've never had anything but beer here.  I've tried the garlic knotss, chicken fingers, pizza, philly chicken cheese sub and the Caesar salad.  Pizza or the Philly chicken would be hands down what I would suggest.  So, totally a bar food selection, but not too greasy and awful-ish.  Santisi's always seems to be packed, but you can usually find a seat if you come just a little bit before the big sporting event for the evening is slated to begin.    I usually come for a sporting event/dinner, and don't stay very late into the night.  I know they have a DJ some nights, karaoke, and quite a few dart boards.    Santisi is my friend."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch sports and play some pool. Had a great time!!!  Had the Philly Cheesestake Pizza. Very good!! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch any game, ridiculous number of TVs all over the walls. The food is very good too. Nice place to play darts if you're into that. I really don't go here often enough.  Be warned it is a very busy and noisy place. Not good for kids. Otherwise, highly recommended"}
{"text":"I just received an email from the owner of Santisi Brothers.  I love this personal touch of service and greatly appreciate a business owner taking the time to address a concern I have.  While it is not always easy to relay an issue at an establishment, Yelp has been a great tool to get across any frustrations.  John Santisi wrote to me today thanking me for my business and Since Santisi Brother has numerous exits, they have had a significant problem with walk outs.  In short, people have taken advantage of the business.    I don't like have to leave a credit card prior to ordering, but I understand the issue and believe that it is a legitimate way to control losses.  Plus, if it keeps prices down...then no worries.  Long story short...still love Santisi Brothers and will return often.  When asked for my credit card up while ordering... i will hand it over with an understanding smile."}
{"text":"My local spot. And I'm not even that local. But it's worth going to being in anthem. They have the hottest bartenders and servers and drinks are awesome. On my last visit Delaney was  the bartender and she made all  of our shots perfect. Always had a drink in front of me and even convinced me to order a sampler platter when I wasn't full. Had the Philly sliders, chicken fingers  and cheeseburger sliders and they were bomb. Great food and an awesome selection of anything u could desire. Grip of TV's so u can always watch whatever u want. Even soccer, which is my fave. They play the fights and have a dope game room with all the fun stuff . Go here. It's fly"}
{"text":"Best food and pizza.....love the trivia there....Great beer and friends!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Came here for Happy Hour on a Friday.  I would have given this place 5 stars if the beers on the menu were actually the beers they offered. I asked for Moose Drool since it was on the menu, but the waitress said they didn't have it and rattled off the beers they DO have. Nothing irritates me more than having something on the menu but not actually having it available.  The Giovanni Wings were out of this world. So flavorful. Just the right amount of crispness. Delicious!  Prices weren't bad at all. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were a bit skeptical when we pulled up but we're glad we have this place a shot. Our waitress was beyond friendly and the food was very good! We had wings, chili, French dip and a Philly cheesesteak (there was 5 of us). Everything came out hot and was tasty! We even had their homemade brownie and cookie for dessert. They were so good! Great place to watch and game and have yummy food!"}
{"text":"Where to start? The waitress was nowhere to be found most of the time and then messed up the drinks repeatedly. As far as the good was concerned (once we FINALLY got to order) the bbq pork sandwich was decent (a bit on the spicy side if you get the Giovanni bbq sauce) and the slaw was nothing special.  Now for the good. The entire inside of the building is wrapped in TVs showing nothing but sports. Seems like this would be the place to go to watch almost any game you wanted."}
{"text":"So this place has the best food ever. We love to get their appetizer platter, the Alfredo is amazing, and they have awesome chicken sammies! Went in there recently and they were pretty busy. Our server asked if I wanted a refill on my soda so I said sure. I got the bill and they charged me again...for 2 sodas. I asked and she said oh ya you didn't read that it says on the menu you get 1 refill.  Now I understand that when there is a fight or game people might sit there for hours and if they gave unlimited refills that could get crazy. ALTHOUGH the cup is 32 oz. it was 28 oz of ice and 4 oz of soda. No I didn't read that on the menu I had just ordered the soda...I wouldn't have ever thought of paying twice since she offered I assumed it was free. Don't offer, or be sure to say it is an extra charge. That was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I am VERY impressed by the owners of this establishment. I did an order off of Grubhub last night for some pizza, one of the toppings I paid extra for wasn't on the pizza. I wasn't concerned at all just wanted to have the fee removed. Pizza was DELICIOUS might I add even without the topping. Anyways, I contacted grubhub to have the fee removed. The owner called me directly waived the entire order charge (absolutely did not have to do that but it is appreciated, greatly) and sent a gift card to come back and try the restaurant. Not only will I do so but I will continue to order long after the gift card is used up. Extremely impressed. You can tell the brothers care greatly about their brand and I fully support that! Way to go! And the food again was great!!"}
{"text":"Pretty surprising for a sports bar. Excellent variety, higher end quality and consistency with everything we've tried here! Even their steamed veggies are amazing. Try their honey medium spicy wings! Bomb! Great service and drinks."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Santisi Brothers tonight (through Grub Hub) and were not impressed. Pizza was average, arrived close to cold, and hamburger with sweet potato fries underwhelming. Ordered the fries extra crispy - they were soggy and cool to the touch... not a bit of crunch. (Skimpy on the portion as well.) Pretty sure they didn't read the special instructions at all. Also, the burger was supposed to come with lettuce and tomatoes - there was no tomato."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service and please keep your opiinions to yourself!  I visited this bar because I heard about the good atmosphere, food, and the number of TV's for the many sports you can watch.  I favorite thing is that it cooks that good old world Italian food.  I lived in Kansas City where there is a good amount of Italians there and being in Arizona that food seems hard to find.  Santisit's has that good Italian family food packaged in a sports bar and not the traditional Italian family restaurant.  Kudos for that now on to the next.    I visited this place twice over the last week and have received bad service and got insulted on the second visit.  On 07/19 with my fiancee.  We ordered a antipasto salad and a stromboli.  We arrived at 3pm and did not receive our order until 3:45.  I believe the only reason we received that because they over heard the conversation that I was going to leave if the food was not out by 3:45.  I was surprised it took so long to bring the food out and especially a salad.  They could have just brought that out first since that was so simple to make.  We were out on Lake Pleasant that day out in the hot sun for about 4 hours and we grew an appetite.  However, we received the food and it was great.    I visited this place again on 07/23 for happy hour after doing some after hours work and I felt really insulted by the bartender that day and I didn't finish my food that day.  I arrived at there around 5:30pm and order a Michelob Ultra and a stromboli again.  Keep in mind that I am a heavyset guy and my bartender was a skinny 130lbs older lady probably around in her 50's.  She brings my order and looks at the plate and makes a remark saying, \"That would last me about 3 days\".  I did not understand why she said that but I paid it no mind until I was ready to go.  I only ate half of the plate and when I asked her to package my plate she makes another remark, \"I'm suprised you didn't eat the whole thing\".  I left the place shocked and insulted.  It took a lot to keep me from cursing this lady out.  I could not believe that she would inpose her opinion on me because I'm heavyset that I just gouge food.  I know that there is a LOT of peope here who gets crazy about this FAT phobia but if it does not affect you, the please don't worry about it.  It's my life and I can do what I want to do.  In addition, you are not a medical professional and you don't know why a person is overweight to begin with.  Even the doctor's themselves do not completely know what causes a person to be overweight becasue if they did 80 percent of adult Americans would not be fat.    This bar really pissed me off and I will not ever go back there again.  On the first time, shame on me but a second time, shame on you.  If the food wasn't good I would probably rate this place a one star.  Please train your staff to pay attention to your customers and be more couretous.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!  Authentic food and a great staff! Ashley the bartender was simply fantastic and I so enjoyed the garlic knots and Stromboli she recommended to have...   I can see why the place was packed, it is LEGIT!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Santisi brothers for many years now. I've never been disappointed in their food or service. It's a great sports bar with fantastic wings and pizza. It's not your typical sports bar. They have tasty ribs, sliders and pasta dishes to name a few. Make sure you try their Giovanni sauce on your ribs or wings which has a sweet spicy flavor. Last night I had the chicken tenders which was made to perfection lightly battered with the chicken tender and moist. Don't even ask me about their soups...all homemade.  Do yourself a favor and check out Santisi Brothers. Did I mention this was a sports bar, lol."}
{"text":"Not great people. Go to a better bar please! They lie! Our DD was 20 years old. We wanted to be safe and not drink and drive. To the best of my knowledge there isn't a law stating someone under the age of 21 needs to leave the establishment by 12pm. Regardless our DD left and I said \"I don't think that's the law but ok\". I was kicked out for arguing with the bartender \"Jessica\". I asked for the manager prior to being kicked out because Jessica suggested we talk with him. Jessica informed the manager that I didn't provide my Id and that is why I was being kicked out. I provided my Id to both \"Jessica\" and \"Johnny\". After which we continued to play pool. A few moments later \"Johnny\" came back to tell us we still needed to leave. He claimed she was the owner and we were being kicked out. I find it odd the owner needed to grab a manager when I asked for one rather than explaining she was the owner. Very bad experience and uncalled for. If they claim I had too many to drink well, I am pretty sure if I did I wouldn't have remembered the names given to me nor such a sour experience 2 days later. On the service side it was actually not the best but also not the worst. We sat for long periods of time before seeing our waitress/ bartender."}
{"text":"Great pizza & wings! Good happy hour deals after work."}
{"text":"Came in to watch a Broncos game with the ol ball and chain.  She's not as big of a fan of the Santisi Girls as I am.  Pizza was fairly ok and the wings were very meaty.  Overall pretty good, but nothing spectacular food wise.  Lots of TVs and anything you want is probably on one of them."}
{"text":"Each time I have gone to Santisi, the pizza has been very good, with a good balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The beers are always cold and fresh with a good selection of crafts beers available. The pies are large enough to split and the waitstaff is friendly.  Maybe not the best place for a date, because the number of televisions is a bit over the top. If you are craving good pizza, then you can't go wrong with Santisi's."}
{"text":"I used Postmates to order BBQ wings and a burger with fries. The wings were good, but far from amazing. However, the burger was really gross. It tasted kind of chewy which makes me believe they used some freezer burn pattys or something. It certainly wasn't fresh at all. Then the fries were cold. I don't live too far from this place and I don't blame the delivery man because they were very cold and floppy. It seemed like they had a big of cheap frozen fries and didn't bother cooking them all the way. I wish I could have sent back the entire order even though the wings were good. I just didn't have the time to do it and a waste of money."}
{"text":"good pizza with too much sauce and too much cheese, great crust very friendly wait staff 115 TVs!"}
{"text":"Since I was 21 this has been our spot. To this Day the Wonderful Bar tender Deb remembers me.  I have moved miles away and my visits have become fewer but damn do i love the food and drink here. Huge Beers and nothing bad on the menu unless you put anchovies on it. Great Place!"}
{"text":"Erica is simply the best.  Takes care of the tvs, always has glass full, always suggests the best foods, even though I have my favorites by now;    The sampler, the pork chops , the pizza, and always my Midwest games.    But then there's Erica. ."}
{"text":"Love Santisi's! Ok, so it gets freaking crowded on Football Sunday, I mean like lines waiting for the place to open, and still not being able to get a seat, if you are in said line!  But there is a reason for it!  I mean it was like when they were decorating, they said, \"hmm, what should we do with this part of the wall here?\"...\"Oh, we can fit another tv\".  The floor to ceiling TV wall is a sight to see, ang big to little, quite funny looking.  I went for the 2nd round of games one Sunday, and they did an audience reaction over the loud speaker to find out which game would be played.  That was pretty cool!  Everything I've ever had from Santisi's is fantastic, best bar food catergory at least! Not original and gourmet fantastic. I especially love the Pasta a la Santisi, or something along that line!  The Pizza is pretty good too!  The chicken tenders are definitely homemade and huge, I mean when I'm explaining them to some one I say it looks like they took a chicken breast sliced it in half and then battered and fried them.  So GOOD.  The onion rings are dipped in the same batter, and when you bite into them for the first time, you don't end up pulling the entire onion out!  Love it!  I am not a big beer fan, so of course I stick the typical light beers, but I do know their isn't a huge selection, so if you are looking out side of Blue Moon and Fat Tire, you will not be satisfied.  But I will say, they do a dang good job at keeping your mugs icey cold, and this is a deal breaker for me.  They used to have a deal that started at like 10pm with the tall mugs, it was pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"This place is always great! Great food. Great drinks. Great wings!!! They always change the TV to accommodate. Happy is the best becuase it's cheap!"}
{"text":"First off Yelp is the best! Customers don't lie! Well me and my fiancé are from Cali and we came across Santisi thanks to yelp. Got the meaty pizza and onion rings... It was incredible. Best onion rings we've ever had and pizza was delicious! Great sports bar with wall to wall TVs! Definitely comin back next time!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the door to see as many TV's as I did in one place. If you cant find the sports you are trying to watch at Santisi Bros, it aint on TV!! They got everything sports on screen, AWESOME! We had the Friday ALL-U-CAN-EAT Fish Fry and Boy did I LOVE THAT FISH!  It was breaded just like Fried Chicken Mom used to make, the Tarter sauce and the cocktail sauce was Perfect for the Fish! Only con about the meal was the French Fries, they were ok, but you definitely have to use Ketchup. I know a lot of places have fries that are so tasty that you dont need Ketchup, these are NOT those. Just like others have said its not a place to go if you are wanting to talk to someone or have a first date, it is VERY LOUD inside. The waitresses were very very pleasant and we felt very comfortable! Overall I would definitely recommend and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Never have I been to a pizza / bar in Az better then here and I can't believe it's taken me 20 ish years to finally give this spot a whirl.  Pros:   Great Pizza, Cheap Beer, Waitresses that don't stank, great appetizers, decent prices, perfect ora, Great UFC bar, you can even bring your mom and dad here :)  Cons: I'm not there with a cold draft in my hand   The S. Bro's pizza combo was legit, heck everything we had tasted good and was hot.  The guy next to me smashed his king crab legs so I am sure you can find something you like here.   It's worth your time, see ya there!     edit : 9/25/ 11  I have been there a few times since and the service has been lacking. I wish the staff would pay more attention, especially during the lunch rush. I noticed they like to bunch up and talk and when you only have 30 minutes to eat and you can't get your check it tends to tick me off.    - asked for ranch and received a snappy response  - people next to us tried to combine tables and was met by a rude waitress telling them they can't do it and almost to the point of yelling at them gave them no option except sitting in tables next to each other in a snappy fashion.   meh, I have experienced better"}
{"text":"I have been going to Santisi's for years even though it is a bit out of my way. It is a great place to watch a game, however many people feel the same way so it is often packed, especially during a big game. Finding a table can be difficult. If you are with a group I highly suggest going early and camping out until the game starts.  Drink prices are a little high for a sports bar... but not too obscene. Mixed drinks are nice and strong.   Most of the food is awesome. Pizza is good, so are garlic knots, fried zucchini, and pizza bread. My husband loves their chicken fingers as well. But the BEST item they have are their calzones. OMG!! They are the BEST calzones in the valley. They are great even without any toppings, just cheese. Nice and crispy on the outside, perfectly seasoned, with very fresh tasting ricotta and mozzarella on the inside. Heaven. And they are huge. Can easily feed two people, especially if you share an appetizer or salad also. All their food is reasonably priced, however I wish they had appetizer specials for happy hour. I would drive over there way more often if they did.   Service is good most of the time. At its worst its just decent. One time we waited 45 minutes for our food including an appetizer sampler. It arrived at the same time as our calzone. And it was lukewarm. :(  Um, I think appetizers should take 10 or 15 minutes tops to get to your table and it should be HOT...    That said, Santisis is a perfect place to eat some delicious food while watching a game. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, friend and I went in last night to play some pool, have a few beers and watch the warriors game. It was a good time; service wasn't too bad, ordered an appetizer (the only thing we ordered) and everyone ate it all! Tasted good at the time until the next day when we all 3 got food poisoning! Completely horrible day it was for us, so I wanted to be nice and call to inform the manager we all got food poisoning for the appetizer (not wanting any money back or trying complain about it) So the first employee who answered the phone was rude when she answered and was busy so I was put on hold, 2 different people picked the phone up to see what I was on hold for. I just wanted to speak to a manager and when I finally spoke to one, she was rude as well; and kept saying we make the food all fresh and that's impossible because no one else called about having food poisoning AND FINALLY SHE HUNG UP ON ME! Completely blown away by the management and how they handled the situation, I spent days and nights and lots of money at this place until today! You lost all of our service!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here every Wednesday for about a year. We get great customer service from Debbie which is the reason we come back time and time again. We have never had anything on the menu that we didn't like! We especially love the pizza and the wings! Giovanni sauce is the best! I would recommend this place to anyone and we try to bring everyone we know here! Love Santisi Brothers"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but man was I let down! Went there with a Groupon for carryout  yesterday and got a pizza and wings. Figured that would be a good way to judge it. I got there about 10 minutes after my order was ready only to wait about another 15 minutes to get my food (pizza wasn't keyed in right, manager took about 10 minutes to show up to type in my Groupon, waitresses had no organization to get my order, etc). Then after we got home and ate some(which you could tell by the temp my food had been sitting for some time), both of us have MASSIVE food poisoning today. I can't speak for him but it was the only thing I ate yesterday so they're is no doubt Santisi's 100% gave me food poisoning AFTER horrible service..."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Cards game with some friends a couple weeks back.  Loved that there were lots of TV's playing different games so you could find a good spot no matter where you were sitting or who you were rooting for.  The food was great too, I got the White Pizza which was delicious.  Service was pretty quick too considering how packed the place was.  Definitely enjoyed the place and would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe I haven't written a review for Santisi Brothers yet. We've been going to this sports bar for yeeeeeeeears. Not so much for watching sports, but the food is great. My husband loves wings and his favorite are from this joint. He'd marry them if he wasn't already married to me.   Unless you come at an off time, it is ALWAYS busy. Service can sometimes be slow, but you can easily keep yourself entertained with the gazillions of TVs or Buzztime games (the trivia ones are my favorite). Once, our server forgot to bring the gamebox my husband requested, so he gave her a B+ on the receipt. She's remembered us each time she's served us since then, and brings the box without us asking. Hahahah.  Along with the wings, most everything on the menu that we've tried has been tasty. The pizza is good, as well as the anitpasto salad, chicken caesar salad, minestrone soup and garlic knots! If you're in the mood for BBQ, you MUST have something with Giovanni's sauce - perfectly tangy sweet with a spicy kick. Ribs are my favorite, but it's also awesome on grilled chicken breast or on wings. Beer prices are decent and they have cider on tap - delicioso!   There is a room with pool tables and darts, although I've hardly ever sat in that area, plus patio seating out front. Sometimes it's kinda cold inside, but maybe I've just been sitting directly under a vent or something. Regardless, definitely recommend Santisi Brothers!"}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar in Phoenix. The food is a slight step up from regular sports bar food: they have a great variety of Italian food. The price is slightly pricey (more than $10 for a pasta dinner), but the portion sizes are big so you get your money's worth. I've tried the baked ziti and there was a good balance of sauce and cheese. The 10'' personal pizza is perfect for a single person: if you're a big eater it should fill you up. I usually get the Santisi Combo w/ pepperoni, sausage and peppers. I also went here a couple of days ago and ordered a cheese calzone, which was very big and could be shared with another person. Their garlic knots are also a must have with every meal: they're not too soggy like the pizza chains and go great with marana sauce.  The ideal place to sit is on the main part of the restaurant with all the televisions (opposite of the game room with the pool tables). I've been here during NFL conference championship weekend and during March Madness and they do a good job showcasing the games people want to see. On a typical Sunday for football, you'll see the big games on the bigger screens and other sports like golf/tennis/soccer on others. They'll even show niche sports like MMA so that is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"Love Santisi Brothers, we generally visit once a week. Great potato skins and great pizza! We've tried lots of different items in the menu they were all very tasty. They have tons of tv's up with all sorts of different games and trivia to keep you busy and a bar side as well where you can play billiards or darts and get a little rowdy! The staff does a great job and are very friendly and like to get know their regulars."}
{"text":"This seems like a very local place. I stopped by because I was in the area and was craving wings. It is a bar with a LOT of tv's. Don't go here if you have epilepsy. Anyway, the bartender was very friendly and hooked me up with a dozen amazing wings. They were excellent. They also have a large menu with a lot of other good looking items. If I'm in the area again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good place, dark, tons of TVs and great food, I like to sit in the restaurant area because it has more to view, and the bar area seems to be full of D-Bags but that's just me. But since it is close to home it's always up there on places to go when you want a quick drink or some bar food."}
{"text":"I will come here every single time I am in town .. the place won my heart over as soon as I walked in and made my stomach so happy. Worth every penny"}
{"text":"DO NOT come here if there is a UFC event and you want to watch literally any other sport.   We came to watch UNC/Duke basketball game (one of the, if not THE biggest, college sports rivalry. We thought with the sheer number of TVs at this place we would have no problem watching this game. Wrong. 100% of the large TVs and almost all of the small TVs were tuned into UFC, even though most people didn't seem to be paying it much attention. Also important to note, this was NOT a pay per view event, which I would be more understanding of. This was on fox sports, aka big whoop.  We found a table and asked the waitress if she could change the TV directly in front of us, she said no but that we could change any of the small (very    small) TVs. I saw a spot at the bar closer to a small TV so my husband asked the lady at the bar if we could change it to our game (it was on a hockey match nobody was watching), and she said she was just *about* to turn it to UFC (as if every other dang TV in the place wasn't already tuned in lol). We immediately decided this was not the place for us and sought another sports bar.   Really poor customer service, no attempt was made to accommodate us. They've definitely lost our business for any future spring training visits."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game, there are tv's in every direction. This place is huge with lots of seating. Their prices are very reasonable, so won't spend yourself silly if you watch a game or fight here."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place on this side of town. There is something for everyone here. Pizza, burgers, chicken, salads, wings, BEER . You get my drift. We came for an early dinner and with wall to wall TVs there's guaranteed something for everyone to watch. I love coming in on Friday nights for their karaoke bingo. There's pool tables as well so yet again there are so many things to keep you busy. Today we ordered a large pizza and a dozen hot wings. I'm kinda a wuss so I'd rather eat mild, but my husband lives for everything and anything hot so we chose the hot. I ate a few which which all I could handle. The pizza is always amazing. I recommend the garlic knots and fried zucchini if you're looking for an appetizer. It's s better deal if you chose a two item or three item combo appetizer, but you better be hungry because it's a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I've been goin in here for quiet some time now and I love it! Between the wings, pizza, and calzones they have the best of the best!! The service is amazing and you truly feel like family!!! Delanie helped me the last time and as always I was more than satisfied with EVERYTHING!!! I'll be a customer for like that's for sure"}
{"text":"We used to eat here a lot and recently thought we'd try the uber eats app. We ordered a large peperoni pizza, 24 giovani wings, 2 7pc strip meals with giovani sauce, coleslaw and salad. Total order came to $70 ish with delivery fees.   I'll start by saying their food is usually top notch and high quality. Everything from their huge calzones to appetizers are excellent. This order has me wondering though. Our wings were luke warm, minuscule in size, and under sauced. Love the flavor of giovani sauce though. On to the pizza. The only complaint here was the temp. Again luke warm at best. The 7pc strip orders were soggy, warm, and under sauced again.   I'm gonna chalk this up to a combination of skimping on quality (size of wings) to save money. The fact that we were also the second stop on uber eats trip cost the food some temperatures. If you order from here, I suggest you call it in and pick it up your self. This will not only save you some money, it will save you some quality as well. We will most likely order from here again, but we'll skip delivery and the tiny wings."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite watering hole. I was introduced to this place by my friend Lyneah almost 5 years ago. I have been coming back here religiously, primarily due to one amazing rockstar of an employee named Delanie. I now frequent this local hot spot at least 4 times a week. This place is the unicorn of sports bars. It has an amazing staff, food, sporting events, and a great core of locals that call this place home. I am here so much, I have my mail sent here. Come give it a try, you won't be disappointed. *sorry could not list all the employees"}
{"text":"You walked in the door and you were immediately greeted by which seems to be 100 televisions all showing sports. The bike is great here, and the food seems to be really good. This would be a really fun place for watching the big game! Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"AMAZING service  AMAZING food AMAZING ambience  LOVE the TV walls LOVE the galaga machine LOVE the claw machine LOVE the wall art in the bathroom. It says \"it's a beautiful life.\" If you're an employee/manager/owner can you tell me where you got it?! I need it for my house! Keep up the great work! This place is always a great time!"}
{"text":"So I used to come here quite often when I lived in the area but it had been awhile, I had lunch with my parents a few weeks back and dinner with my dad last night for fish Friday. It was PACKED! However even with the amount of people there the service was on point! I wish I remembered her name but I can't, tall slender blonde, she was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of! Food was good my first time having the fish and portions are big! Comes with Cole slaw which typically I don't like but this one was good, also fries. All in all everything was good and I'd definitely come back for the fish!"}
{"text":"For all the people that haven't had the Fettuccine Alfredo or the baby back ribs. YOU HAVEN'T EATEN AT SANTISI'S!  These two dishes are the best in town! The pizza is good, the wings are good.  But these two are F···Ing amazing!  I bring new people here all the time (some from Chandler) and everyone talks about how they can wait to go back.  If you ask the owners what you should have, they will say the same thing. Best things on the menu!   Meatballs are right up there too! The owners Mom  comes in every day and makes them fresh!   I don't live anywhere near the place, but it's a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place especially on Wednesday and Saturday nights with the crab leg specials. Crab legs are served fresh and gets us very fool, the beer is super cold. Last time we were there, I ordered the nightly special 25oz Blue Moon brewski, darn it was good! My sister and brother and law weren't aware of the special so they ordered the traditional in a bottle Heini, then gave me crap about it all night that I was drinking a pitcher of beer and it was practically a 12-pack lol! I told them \"oh be quiet, if you guys knew of the special you would of ordered the same thing\". Love the atmosphere, little too noisy and gets a little crowded but kid friendly."}
{"text":"We show up to watch the Cardinals game for breakfast with the kids and this joke of a place had only two TVs in the dining area showing the Cardinals game. The tables are all saved by people crowded around the two tvs. this is an Arizona sports bar? Really? Meanwhile they have all this Cardinals signage up. We always go here for games and their food is amazing but why did my fam and I have to drive to three places this morning until we found a decent place to watch the Cards game? So pretty much don't go here if you want to catch a local team game on Sunday but Raiders and Steelers, yep they've got that....on multiple tvs."}
{"text":"Great specials and this is one of the only places open late in the area thats still social and fun!"}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service and horrible karaoke in the lounge area and the free wifi doesn't work either"}
{"text":"The only complaint is that there are no speakers at the main bar. Can't hear TV sound. Really needs to address this ASAP."}
{"text":"Let me just say..you will NOT leave hungry after eating here. The portions are huge! And taste perfect!! The pizza was great! So was the veggie plate app. The frech fries were awesome, too. And the powdered donut things!!! YUM!!  And you get a ton of them! Same goes for the drinks.  HUGE glasses. Which is good, so you are not having to need a refill every 10 seconds. TONS of tv's, too. You wont miss a thing. I will deff. be back"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place to come and hang out with friends.  The food is good and the drinks are even better.  I have been here on Sunday morning to watch football and almost had a seizure because I don't know which tv to focus on because they have all the games playing on multiple tv's. The watresses seem to always be in a good mood and having a good time. I have some of my best drunk memeories from here (Patron) that I can and can't remember."}
{"text":"It's not a super classy joint, by any means, but it is definitely what I think a neighborhood bar should be, if it were on steroids.  Sports bar, pool hall, dart boards, pub grub, video games, and a tremendously average crowd.  Sometimes crowded, but the staff appeared to keep up pretty well."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Wednesday night to use a Groupon we'd purchased. They appeared to be under construction and I was told there was a sign missing from the front of the building identifying the place. They have a nice sized patio although it faces the west and I'm sure it was not very comfortable on this evening. Lots of TVs in the place but I agree with one other poster, some are way too small. We mostly ordered beers but also had some meatball sliders and mozzarella sticks. I had seen the posts about how great the food was, but a sports bar is not usually the type of place I go for a full meal. Our server was very patient and helpful. Very nice selection of craft beers. I think I would have been more impressed if the seating didn't feel so cramped, although that could be due to the ongoing construction. We normally sit at the bar, but prefer the horseshoe style bar at Big Guys to the one at this bar. Big Guys wins for me."}
{"text":"Wow! Hoppin place (game 1 of nba finals!) with some solid bar and grill food. I was pleasantly surprised to hear they had a gluten free pizza and jumped on the opportunity. I wasn't let down! Not only was the crust not the generic cardboard gf variety but it was one of the best gf crusts I've come across! Had the Dino's BBQ pizza with pulled pork - phenomenal! Glad to recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is kind of lousy. And the clientele is grimy...so grimy to where I have to sit outside to not be disgusted when I'm eating."}
{"text":"Awkward that before I was finished ordering , Jessica stopped me and asked me if I was paying as I go or starting a tab.... she asked for my card and my ID and wanted to keep both of them. She said it was company policy. Definitely not comfortable leaving anyone my card, and ID on top of that? Get with the times, if you leave a tab open , you pre-oth the card and hand it back. YOU DONT ATTEMPT TO KEEP SOMEONES CARD AND ID . Who would comfortably let that happen?"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Great atmosphere. Our server, Marcela, was great! So charismatic, efficient, and attentive. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but only after 9pm and mainly only in the bar area. It tends to be bit overcrowded with the normal D-Bags you find in north Phoenix bars.  Getting a drink is an ok experience... not instant service but less than a five minute wait usually.   I cannot comment on the food I have never tried it.  Minus the local crowd you get in this area the place is ok as far as atmosphere goes.  The cops tend to stand outside all night so you get the idea of what goes on.   PS - Someone stole my headlight while parked outside of this bar."}
{"text":"After a long night, I came here for a light lunch, a beer, and some football. I didn't know strip malls that looked this trashy existed on Bell Road, but I had a decent surprise when I walked in.  There were tons of TVs to watch, an extensive menu that attempts to go beyond just plain bar food, and cheap 25 oz. beers. In the middle of the day, that giant mug of Coors Light was almost intimidating. I also noticed some daily drink specials.   We ordered a Sicilian pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. What a ripoff! For $22.50, I expected something better than what I get for like $7 at Little Caesar's. Nothing about it was quality, and for one of the most expensive pies I've had, I expected at least average. Pizza gets one star, this is no \"pizzeria\".  But despite tables that are 6 inches apart, a patio that's clearly missing some TVs, and the marginally attractive women in uniform, I can't hate on this place. It's a solid watering hole in the Northwest valley, and judging by all the guys storming out with their Eli Manning jerseys after Philly's comeback, they take football seriously. I'll be back, Santisis. Don't disappoint."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good sports bar, pleasant waitresses, literally wall to wall TVs, and good food.  They have the best, most authentic calzone I have had out here in AZ (properly mixed cheese filling, and they will not do more than three extra fillings as it would comprise the calzone: i would recommend getting garlic as one of your extras as it can be a bit mild without it).  Their wings are standard to good, pizza is passable ect.  One nice thing is they do have a cheap buffet option ($9 or $10) before noon on Sundays and for Monday night football that includes both buffalo and barbecue wings, a variety of pizzas, a couple of different salads, meatballs, breadsticks, baked pasta, ect.  Negatives are a relatively limited selection of beers on tap, and here is the really big minus for me: the TVs are not HD.  Sure it's great that you have a ton of TVs for a sports bar, but for even the feature big screens to not be 1080i at a minimum is just unacceptable.  If there are multiple games I want to keep track of and will spend the afternoon munching I am always happy to be here, but if I am just interested in a single game I will stay home as i have a bigger, better TV in my living room beckoning..."}
{"text":"It's actually pretty cool eating at this restaurant because there's a lot of TVs everywhere!  The one thing I didn't like about his place are the slow waitresses. Even when it's slow, they are so slow! But besides that let's talk about their food. The chicken wings here are really good and I love how they have a lot of sauce on them. The pizza that we normally get has everything on it and it's yummy. However, it's very greasy and the dough is super thin so it can get soggy."}
{"text":"I'm here on biz from Vegas ... Read the reviews that talked about slow service, etc, but had some time to kill (and wanted some draft beer) so I headed over to Santisi's.  Gotta say ... Wow!  Wings were great ( go for their 'house sauce') and the service was great.  Philly sliders were awesome!!  Definitely will be back if in this part of town."}
{"text":"WHY did you change out the french fries?  The prior fries were delicious and executed perfectly every single time!! I boycott the new french fries..  Still love ya Tisi.."}
{"text":"We're out-of-towners heading toward Phoenix and wanted to watch the UFC fights somewhere.  This place had the best food ratings of our choices and it was on our way.  We got there early but the place was packed anyway!  We shared a table with another couple and they assured us the food was very good.    Our new friends and fellow Yelpers' commendations were confirmed.  The food was, indeed very good after all.  We got a sampler plate and hot buffalo wings along with some beers.  The pizza looked very good & tempting, too.  There were TONS of TVs to watch all the action and they had 'ring girls' carrying the signs for each round through the place.   It was a good time, a fun atmosphere and very tasty food!"}
{"text":"Had to make a trip out to Phoenix to pick up a new piece of equipment for my shop....as long as I was in Phoenix, I figured it'd be a good time to see my old friend Rob who moved out their last year as well.  So I loaded up the machinery....called Rob and asked where we should meet. He picked Santisi Brothers. It was convienent to both of us and Rob said it was his new watering hole.   Walking in, the first thing I noticed is that it's fairly dimly lit. I LIKE that. It's bigger on the inside than it appears as well. (They also have a patio outside with a plasma tv and misters) This place has a TON of T.V.'s. There was every imaginable sport and/or event possible on all at once. I never looked up and couldn't find something interesting going on.   Food wise I had the chicken breast meal with a salad. Everything was tasty.....Rob and his girl had pizza which looked very good. Waitress was on top of it and customers were mostly happy and laughing.   Nice place."}
{"text":"Great family pub! Always impressed with the staff and how well they handle busy nights. Food and drinks are always great."}
{"text":"Not our normal stomping grounds but was driving back from Flagstaff and wanted to stop in and get some dinner and watch the game.  Place is most definently a sports bar with your typical sports bar food that leans on Italian.  Food came out fast an was tasty.  My biggest complaint is about the lack of good craft beer. The have some but could do a much better job and really elevate this place and ween people off of bud miller coors."}
{"text":"Kitchen closes before bar does, but was not told that on the phone. Came in, sat ourselves at a table with the menu on it. After 5 minutes, someone comes over and doesn't even ask about drinks, just says the kitchen closed 2 minutes ago. One, we were there for 5 minutes, so we could have ordered if someone came to serve us. Two, I was told the opposite to start and it's not posted anywhere. Sad because it looks like a cool place. Won't make it back in."}
{"text":"I got the mussels here.... BIG MISTAKE!!! Cool atmosphere. I shouldn't have listened to my boss' food recommendation."}
{"text":"If you're concerned about your weight, stay the hell away from here. Unless you're concerned about being underweight, in which case saddle up. I had the calzone and it probably came in at just shy of 3 pounds. I carved about a 1 inch strip off the side and saved it for the next day, Sunday, when I would inevitably be hungover and in need of 287 grams of fat in one sitting. What can I say? It was a glorious Sunday."}
{"text":"Desided to try this place again after some bad service last time, the pizza and wings are oh so good and the service is way better this time around. Think the only thing that would make this place better is if they had a roll of towels and some wet naps at the table."}
{"text":"Great wings , good beer selection, although I would like to see more beers on tap (some ambers & early morning pilsners). Staff is really nice. Wall of sports, can't go wrong..."}
{"text":"Awesomeness.   Love my little Italy,  a wonderful sandwich  especially with the pasta salad.   The bartender  Debbie Gettings is lovely  and very sweet.   Great time."}
{"text":"Wings and pizza are great. Service is hit or miss. Walked in this time sat down. 20 minutes later ask a waitress \"hi it's been about 20 minutes, can we get a server?\". Response from waitress \"Oh you should have stopped someone sooner\". Really, it's my job to seek out a server. Nothing like making me feel bad for waiting..."}
{"text":"Their soups, sliders and mini hotdogs are great! The atmosphere with the TVs couldn't be better."}
{"text":"Went for UFC fight. Awesome place, our server helped us get a table when it was super packed. She's the real MVP"}
{"text":"Too noisy and loud. Also the wings were not  cooked all the way through.There was also a dog brought in & not service animal this was 3/29/18.  People smoking, no one is suppose to smoke outside the doors or  anywhere outside the building"}
{"text":"The food here is actually AMAZING!!! So great for bar food. The service here is always top notch also. They do have a lot of tvs but they are all pretty small and hard to watch (maybe I'm just old)"}
{"text":"Really good food,  great place for cheap drinks during happy hour.  Fun spot for pool and Kareoke. Gets a little crowded but that's because it's good."}
{"text":"I'm not too big on pizza since I'm lactose-intolerant, but I found this pizza better to digest then Domino's and Red Devil, IE a chain pizzeria.  I got the Southern BBQ W/ Dino sauce and a typical pepperoni with mushroom. I didn't find the sauce to be overbearing, however I did find it kinda soggy when it gets to the middle/center of the pie. I'm not sure if it's the oil or just the way they cook it. At least the dough doesn't smell like yeast, so that is a plus.  I would recommend going here over any chain pizzeria any day, it does taste good, but cook the pizza longer to create a more satisfying center."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a sports event and eat the fantastic chicken wings."}
{"text":"So.  Many.  TVs.  If you want to watch a game (or many games all at once), this is the place.  Alas, my review will solely be for the ambience at this point, as I was too engrossed in the nail-biter of a game to eat more than a few pieces of broccoli from the vegetable tray.  I recently visited Santisi Brothers to catch the U of A vs. Washington basketball game (Go Cats!) and was simply amazed by the number of flashing screens upon walking in.  A row of large flatscreens run along the walls with smaller screens above them.  When they switched all the big screens to the U of A game, it was magical.  My friend and I were happy to find some other Wildcats (tough to come by in ASU/enemy territory) to form our own mini-McKale.  Something that I noticed that is extremely important for ideal television viewing in this scenario is the layout of the tables.  They have regular-height tables along the walls, with bar tops and stools set behind them.  This creates almost a stadium-style set up for viewing the screens.  Maybe not important for everyone, but if you're 5'3\" and accustomed to hopping up and down or peering through armpits to get a glimpse of the action in front, you'll appreciate the thought put into this.  Service was pretty good.  We were there through the shift change and both waitresses made sure to periodically check in to make sure things were okay.  (And possibly to see if we'd like to order some freaking food already.  Sorry ladies, it was late in the afternoon and I wasn't about to gorge myself on bar food before a tasty dinner with the in-laws.  Maybe next time.)  The ladies room was pretty clean but had one of the shortest toilets I've seen in a long time.  Goodness, it was like it was child-sized it was so low to the ground.  Glad I'm not so old and broken down that I needed help getting back up.  If you are a newbie, as I was, you may have some difficulty finding the place at first.  It's located in a giant strip center on the northwest corner of I-17 and Bell.  Once upon a time, the center used to be pretty full.  Now it's kind of a ghost town with Hooters and Native New Yorker along Bell and the dollar  theaters and Santisi as the big names set in the back.  Sometimes they have a Halloween store too.  Do not let the blight deter you though.  Power through the empty parking lots and enjoy the flickering goodness of a plethora of televisions."}
{"text":"It doesn't surprise me that I've never been in this place in the 10 years I've lived down the street. I'm just not that big on team sports. However, last night I was craving wings and m' lady was keen on a good salad so we ventured off to somewhere new. This place took me by surprise. I knew there was going to be a ton of TVs but I was expecting it to be a bit more raucous than it was during Sunday Night Football. Our waitress, Cara, was cute, efficient, and attentive. We ordered a coupla big beers, I had a shot of Jack, and we settled in for some wings, garlic knots, and antipasto salad which features Boar's Head cold cuts. Everything was on point. Can't complain. We sat in the family side of the place, so there were kids with their parents' groups and they were all very well mannered, mostly dinking about on smartphones, of course. While most TVs were tuned to football, some featured golf, skateboarding or snowboarding also - so its a good mix. I'd go back for the wings which were suicide (not deadly hot but glad I went above \"hot\") and xtra crispy as requested."}
{"text":"Place was very good! Pizza wings and enviroment was very great,took my 6 month baby boy and girlfriend and every person and staff would give him attention when they pass by,very friendly people...Great place to watch some sports as well"}
{"text":"We had a small group go in for snacks and drinks after visiting the 13th Floor haunted house on the other side of the mall. We got a table on the patio and when we ordered with our waitress, she wanted a credit card or for us to pay as we go. Now maybe this place has some sort of problem with people walking out on them, but if thats the case its probably because of staff like her. When I questioned her about it she tried to give us some half hearted sob story about why it needed to be done. I guess at this point realizing I was pretty irritated and wasn't going to do either of the options she had given me, she offered up another server which we gladly accepted. The next waitress was much more pleasant and friendly and [shockingly!] didn't require a credit card deposit or to pay as we go.  Overall it was a pretty bad first impression, but by the end of the night I was satisfied. The fried zucchini was pretty good, I wasn't too impressed with the fries or the garlic bread that we got though. The beer was nice and cold!"}
{"text":"I came here last weekend for a night out with my wife. We ordered our drinks and started on some hot wings and sliders.  I thought the sliders were great. I even took the left over to work the following Monday. The ability to customize them is a nice touch.  As for our wings,  I've always heard a lot of good about them. I'm happy to say I wasn't let down. The wings were flavorful and perfectly sized. The hot was just hot enough to clear your sinuses without taking away from the delicious flavor.  The happy hour pricing is also a great touch.   Since we came when they were in full bar mode the atmosphere was loud. But I'd be willing to come back and explore Santisi Brothers earlier in the evening to see how the restaurant side works in comparison."}
{"text":"Santisi's has been my watering hole for just past 9 years. They have EXCELLENT food, GREAT (gals) service, an AWESOME owner(s), FUN poker and More TVs than a Las Vegas Hotel.  (Overall rating: 5/5 Stars. The following is rated by \"out of five\" stars.)  Ambiance: 5/5  Service: 5/5 - VERY friendly and funny.  Food Taste: 5/5 - Best in (NY) Italian I've had. Best is their Lasagna.  Food Quality: 5/5  Cleanliness: 5/5 - Very kept up, always clean, and if a spill does occur, the staff immediately takes care of it.  Friendly Staff: 5/5 - I've developed friends with some of the girls, and guys, outside of Santisi's.  Fast Busing: 5/5 - Extremely - they're always there when you need them.  Smoking Area: Outside, very large patio, and even some of the patio is segregated for non-smokers, if you prefer to bake in the AZ heat. (It's covered, though, with both heaters and misters.)  Would I Return?: 5/5 Absolutely, I've been going for over 9 years, after all.  Would I Recommend?: Yes  And to who?: Anyone from age 5-97  Additional Information: You've gotta see it for yourself. Especially if you like sports. I don't particularly, except for channel FUEL ad D-Backs. I go for all the other reasons. The Girls, The Poker and the NTN."}
{"text":"This is a good place for men. You can relax and have a pint of a great beer. they also serve food, chicken is always good and as spicy as you like.  There is a comfortable smoking area outside if you want to get some air :)"}
{"text":"Wait times were too long and the bar was way to dark. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I stayed near here during a recent trip and I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza in phenomenal. Service wasnt the best, but they were busy, and the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"4 stars for having probably the most TVs in a sports bar.  I love this place for that reason.  I mean, pretty much every inch is covered with a TV.  You could watch anything you want.  I recommend sitting in one of the high tops.  Then you could watch any TV you want.  Facing the bar doesn't get you much of anything.  When you sit at the low tables in front of the tvs, the view is okay but it feels like everyone is watching you and you're way too close to the TV lol. Enough about that.    Food.  Pretty decent.  Burgers, fries, pizzas.  Totally recommend.  Wings too.  Oh, and nachos.  Yum.  Pastas, not so much.  Remember, bar food.  Stick to bar food and you should be okay.    Service.  It's never been that great.  I go for the TV, food, happy hour.  They always seem to hire really young, inexperienced servers.  Probably cheaper for them.  Plus, they might be short staffed.  It seems they have more guys cleaning tables than girls taking orders.  Would explain why the servers take so long to come around the tables.  Most of them are pretty nice but service is really slow.    I would still recommend this place to watch sports and eat good bar food.  They won't change the staffing model.  Shrug."}
{"text":"If your a sports junkie this is the place for you. This place if covered wall to wall with T.V.'s. The service wasn't to good. It took a while for someone to help us but by the end of the night it got better. The food is good. We had pizza and a few appetizers. Its reasonably priced. Good beer selection. The place gets full pretty quick so go early."}
{"text":"Santisi is a Sports bar right off I17 and Bell, conveniently located with plenty of parking.  Santisi is large with tons televisions, you will never miss a game whatever game that may be.  Food;  Must go to Crab Night on Wednesday or Saturday it has to be the best I ever had, yes the best Crab Night at a local sports bar.  With the dinner get Mashed Potatoes and Sauteed Vegetables, MUST haves.  The beverages all always ice cold.  Service; This experience was amazing, she was always friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"I am absolutely upset with this location! I called the restaurant around 8PM  on a Friday night & was told they do not deliver!! I then ordered from GrubHub Online & was told the Pizza would be here approximately 45 minutes later- less than 4 miles away. At 8:46 I got a call from GrubHub customer service saying the restaurant wasn't taking anymore orders so they had canceled my order!! They said my money will be refunded in 3-5 business days!! I will NEVER eat at this restaurant & I will probably not use GrubHub because they should not charge my card before the restaurant confirms the order!"}
{"text":"The bartender was very friendly and kept up on everyone that was at the bar. Great personalty.  Place was clean and well kept, drinks were reasonably priced.  They also have a lot of TV's with every sport playing along with Music Video."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most frustrating place I have ever gone to eat. They are charging $12 for a frozen burger patty that they won't cook anything less than medium well. That says to me that their meat quality sucks and any hamburger that you are charging $12 for, should be choice meet that is freshly made every day not frozen. Too bad the business owner of this place knows very little about good quality food at good prices.  And second no matter how many Wings you order you can only get one flavor. You cannot split up your wings in the multiple flavors. This is extremely frustrating for anyone who is new to this place and would like to try a couple of different flavors but not ordered a ton of wings. You can order 12 wings for $10 or 24 wings for $18. But you cannot order 24 wings with two different flavors at $18. You have to do two separate orders of 12 wings at $10 an order. Am I taking crazy pills or does this place need a complete renovation on their business policies? It's really too bad that this place does not cater to the customer.  I will not be returning no matter what. Unless some business policies are changed the price of the hamburgers go down or the quality of the meet goes up. Freakin frozen patties??? Costco anyone?"}
{"text":"{Solid 3.5 stars rounded up.}  The patio is rather unassuming...and then you walk in.....   Media, sensory overload.....electronic flashes and strobing projections from televisions big and small.  Boxing, soccer, basketball, football, news, surfing skating, karaoke, music videos...it's all there....on the dozens of TVs lining the walls and tucked in every corner of the bar.   It was a Saturday night after 8pm and it was packed! We found a couple of seats at the bar. We ordered 2 large Blue Moons that were on special at $5 somethin' each. I was enjoying the casual nature of the place and that I could scan over and see at least 2 NBA games going on at the same time.   We had just dropped in from having sushi at a place up the way but we were both wishing we weren't so full, because the food looked and smelled pretty good. Also after looking at the calendar on the bathroom stalls they offer some drink and food specials daily (including a day they serve crab legs).   I can tell ya when in the area I can see myself stopping in or recommending it to folks. [Even if it does share the same general area as a Hooters, Applebees and some other big chain sports/pub/food place]"}
{"text":"We popped in here for a snack and drink. The atmosphere is amazing! I've never seen so many TVs in my life. It's definitely an awesome place to watch a game with friends. The staff seemed nice and our waitress did her job. We got two appetizers; garlic cheesy bread and the seasoned French fries. The garlic cheesy bread was a huge portion and delicious. The fries were eh. It lacked salt completely and I couldn't really taste the seasoning."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Santisi's for well over 10 years, now and they are consistently great.  From atmosphere to great food.  Their Giovanni wings are the best and you really can't go wrong with Giovanni sauce on just about anything.  As other reviews have said yes, it is noisy  (Well, it IS a sports bar) and no, not suitable for children.  But a great place to have a lazy afternoon, watching a game over a few beers and a sandwich or an order of wings."}
{"text":"horrible experience. we brought a table of 10 to watch the Stanley Cup Finals and were forced to sit outside in the heat because of the filled capacity inside (not an issue). right before the 3rd period started, the manager came outside and changed the TVs to the UFC fight for two people that wanted to watch it. we tried telling them how we had been waiting outside the longest, brought the most people, and that the game was almost over. and the UFC fights had just begun! they weren't even fights that people wanted to watch. not once did I get an apology, the two managers were only there to argue with me. I can't believe they were actually managers because of how bad the hospitality was. never again"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I love Love LOVE their karaoke! I love how the waiters sing...they have such great voices! The place is loaded with several televisions to watch all your sports. Not only is this place great for entertainment, but the food is great too! The pizza and wings ftw!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times and always was good! My last time was perfect! I sat at the bar and the bartender Delaney was amazing. She was extremely nice and made me the perfect drink! Not at any point was my drink empty, she made sure I was happy and had exactly what I wanted! I will definitely be back! What a perfect sports bar"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sports bar. Has plenty of T.V's to watch any sports event. They also have poker for free and can win certificates for food and drinks. Servers are friendly . Overall I always have a good time at Santisis"}
{"text":"Tons of tvs and great wings!!! This place puts any sports bar to shame that I've been in from coast to coast!"}
{"text":"Still not 5 star, but at least they updated the TV's like I mentioned in my last review.  The problem now is there is are so many TV's, it gets hot in there and the A/C can't keep up. OK, granted, I'm a fat guy that sweats if the winds not blowing, but here, I sweat until I walk out the door.  That said, the thing that keeps me coming back is the Pizza, Pasta, Salad and Wings Lunch buffet on Friday. Well worth the asking price (recently raised to $10.99 I believe) and all the sweat endured from a fat man!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have to start by saying Santisi Brothers is one of my favorite restaurants! The food it 5+ stars hands down! Now....with that being said...the waitresses and service, -3. Anything here involving a waitress takes fooorever! It took us 15 minutes just to get water and when we looked around to see where all the waitresses were, they were just standing gathered over by the bar. Our check was wrong and we only ordered like 4 things and then again..another 15 minute wait  Refills? Forget about that, by the time we got asked for refills we were done eating and ready for the check. It's too bad too because they definitely would have made money off our beer/drink orders. If you guys hired some new staff, this place would by far beat out any other sports bar!"}
{"text":"Overhyped and I don't know why.  Unless maybe those kids whose parents used the \"electronic babysitter\" too much grew up and found a place to feel at home - substitute a beer for the bottle, plop in front of TV.  Selection of beers on tap had a couple of nice choices, but c'mon, if I'm going to have to pay $6.75 for a large so-called premium/import draft, I'd better be having a little more skin shaking in my face than I'd care to have from these \"Santisi Girls\".  I'm sure they're nice young ladies, but I don't see coming here for the benefit of their obligatory company or vacant personalities, even if I was a single horny young 21 yo dude.  Saw a few small groups having fun with darts and pool balls, and a few lost souls at the bar.  Mostly I saw a few of the staff working hard (a busser and a waitress) while the rest of the folks in SB tshirts milled around and chit chatted each other up.  There weren't many people when I was there kind of late on I can't remember if a Sunday or weeknight.  The lighting was quite bright, allowing me to see all that grime and slime that normally goes unnoticed in this type of place.  What you don't know CAN hurt you, but even so, ignorance is bliss, so I'm only eating in *dimly lit* sports bars from now on.   That lighting is there for a reason, and it's not just to cause you the lovely surprise of waking up hung over next to a sasquatch after a night of binge drinking with your community college \"frat\" buddies.   I need a call out from my man, Flavor-Flav, BOYEEEEEEEE!!, cuz this one's made the Don't Believe the Hype List."}
{"text":"So many TVs! Great.  Food here is pretty decent, standard bar fare with great pizza. Service is decent too.  This place is huge, there is outdoor seating and tons of other spaces as well.  Tons of TVs, like I said, probably the most in any Phoenix sports bar!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with some friends and enjoyed it! I had a giant blue moon (since it was the blue moon and all...)...and it was big. The bear was like 24 oz. That thing was heavy! I had the baked ziti for dinner and it was pretty delicious....hot and bubbly and super cheesy. I tasted some of my friends wing sauce (the spicy and sweet special sauce...forgot the name) it was super delicious. I would definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Chicago, and was looking for some tasty pizza. I saw the reviews here, and I have to agree. This is pretty darn good pizza! We ordered NY Style with GP, M, and P. I thought I tasted a little salt and pepper on the pizza. Either way, I'll be back!  Regarding the TVs, there's lots of them!"}
{"text":"Great place to come if you're looking to watch sports, eat dinner or just have a great night out! I love coming here, very lively and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stayed at a nearby hotel for a week and ended up at this bar 3 nights out of 5. Each time the food was really good, came out fast, and portions were enough to leave us full and them some. The chicken tenders are pretty darn good, so are the wings. The Giovanni salad with chicken is amazing. Get the small size unless you plan on sharing with 4 other people. Our only complaint is that service can be spotty depending on your server."}
{"text":"Totes dive bar but it has a million TVs and is a fun joint to go to after work for happy hour. The drinks are reasonably priced and the staff, for the most part, is attentive and nice.   They seem to have a very nice variety of booze and you can order pretty much whatever you want. The beer tastes fresh and is cold and refreshing. They must clean out the beer drums regularly because it's very crisp.  The location is not ideal and attracts a lot of homeless or less than kosher characters. It's located right next to a discount theater in a dying plaza where almost everything is out of business."}
{"text":"You know, I used to really like this place.  My previous review was 4 stars.  They had a couple of good subs, but that quality has hit the fan in the past year.   I've made two to-go orders recently and they were BOTH messed up.  Each time, I ordered a salad w my sub and didn't receive it.  The first time, I was reallllly craving a salad and they forgot it - it was late and I was hungry, so I actually went back to Santisi's to get my food - a 40 minute round-trip from my neck of the woods.  This second time, hungry and fed up, I was not willing to drive back to Santisi's to have them fix their mistake.  So, I called to speak to a manager.   Johnny, the manager, told me that he would issue a gift certificate.  I explained that this was the last time I'm going there: it's a far drive and this is the second time they've messed up a simple order.  The subs aren't even what they used to be.  (Unless you LIKE soggy bread under your meatballs, of course.)  I just wanted the cost of my sandwich refunded (the salad comes w the sandwich) to the card I used.  Either ignoring my point or just not caring, he told me that I would have to drive to Santisi's to get a refund, because they needed to swipe my card and could not take the numbers over the phone.  Baloney, anyone?  Johnny just kept repeating policy until I got more and more frustrated with the fact that, again, it's MY responsibility to incur gas costs and take ANOTHER 40 minute drive so they could fix a mistake THEY made -- for a SECOND TIME!!  Finally, Johnny put me on hold while I was mid-sentence.  Really?!?!  I am apalled - and piiiiiissed! I thought this situation was deplorable and maybe an owner would care to hear about their dysfunctional kitchen and worse management.  WRONG!  I called to ask for the GM name, was not given a name, and put on hold for over four minutes.  Finally, Toni Santisi and I speak and not only does she deny Johnny put me on hold mid-sentence (the customer is always right, right?!) but she barely lets me get out a complete sentence and talks over me the whole time to end by insulting me.  She said she cannnot issue a partial refund, but she can void the entire transaction in order to have my husband and I never set foot in her dirty bar again.  I'm sure she won't issue a refund because - surprise! - they never took our name when we ordered on the phone.  Way to run your business.  Besides, that was decided when I came home and you screwed my order up for the SECOND TIME IN A ROW. Now, don't get me wrong, I will go out of my way for exceptional food (I'm talking to you, Capriotti's sub shop on Mill), but I will NOT go out of my way to have so-so food from a place run by monkeys."}
{"text":"You can't expect much from bar food, but the bar food at Santisi Brothers takes it to another level! The pizza is good, wings are amazing, and seasoned fries are excellent. Sports playing on every screen, pool tables, darts, drink specials and good customer service. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice place so far lots of TVs upbeat atmosphere very Nice waitresses and so far good pizza would suggest coming here is a little out-of-the-way And hidden"}
{"text":"Visited this place twice and both times received really poor service, once at the bar and once a table. Pizza was okay; better than Domino's but nothing special. I like playing Buzztime Trivia and QB1. The third time I went there the Arizona Cardinals were featured as the QB1 game. I go to a sports bar to watch the other NFL games because the Cardinals are on regular television. If I wanted to watch the Cardinals I would do so at home. I didn't stay that day and haven't been back since. The place might have gotten better, might still be the same. I'm not willing to take the chance."}
{"text":"Our waitress was slow and had poor customer service won't see her again but  otherwise love the atmosphere, food and beer."}
{"text":"We have been to Santisi Brothers several times and usually leave very happy.  We dined yesterday (4/17/18) and were very disappointed.  Destainy was our waitress and she was excellent.   I had ordered the fried shrimp and my husband had the mussels.  The shrimp were overdone and had too much breading, and some of the mussels were not edible.  I guess seafood is something we won't order again at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Big shout out to ruby! After grub hub made an absolute fool of themselves in not only not delivering my food but not fixing it, my girl pulled through. Being in the industry and having four hungry kids, the last thing you want to hear is that your food is not going to be delivered. This place has an awesome manager and made things right and I have four full kids thanks to her. Side note if you want it delivered... go uber eats."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. It's the second time we've been there and both times have been excellent. Debbie was our bartender and she was fantastic. The service was great the food was excellent and we really enjoyed our time there. It was a very good value. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing place if your a sports fan they have literally hundreds of screens with every sport in the United States and that's good but no European sports like football or darts sadly. My only complaints are regarding the attitude of our server (Kaci) and that the server was asked to give change for the pool table, given a $50 she gave $13 immediately and said she'd bring the remainder asap. 2 hours later we were ready to pay our tab and had to request the balance of our $50. From the time we arrived to the time we left Kaci acted like our patronage was an inconvenience.  I've been here twice with the first time being during peak hours and received great service,  this second visit was during off peak hours and very slow. No excuse for the attitude our the blatant effort to snatch $37 from us."}
{"text":"I tried to eat here tonight, but experienced service that was so bad, I decided it was best to leave without eating. The place was packed, but I was able to find a small table. After a considerable time, a waitress acknowledged me and told me she would return to get my order. After more time passed, she took my order. After getting my drink, I went to wash my hands. After I returned from the restroom, I found my table had been given away to another party and my drink was gone. I found my waitress and explained the situation. She wasn't much help and tried to seat me with some group without even offering to get me another drink. I decided at this point it was best to leave and eat somewhere that doesn't only cater to groups."}
{"text":"Please trust me on this. Order 2 things here.  1) Their John Daly drink. Best alcohol drink I've ever had. I called the bartender after I flew home begging for the recipe.   2) Basket of Zeppolis. Best dessert I've had in 2 years. Easily. Make sure to ask for chocolate syrup in addition to the honey. And then pour the chocolate syrup all over them. You will not regret this.  After you do these two things, come back and give my rating a high five. Then I want you to text my rating at 3am saying \"I love you. Thank you for the best night ever\"  P.S. They have about 300 TV's at this place. Awesome."}
{"text":"This is bar none, har de har, my favorite bar. Had some really great times here. The drinks are always good- which is not always the case when you like the fruity frou-frou drinks- and I do!  I have tried several different things on the menu and have never had anything to complain about. Definitely better than your average bar food here. They have the BEST pizza and wings. And for those of us with A.D.D. they have 70 some odd televisions to keep you good and distracted. AND- they always have FUEL on at least a few of those- which I appreciate, because I enjoy the extreme sports rather than the standard men in tights- chasing balls -stuff that most seem to like  :-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place,  delicious food. Great service,  pool tackles,  darts, karaoke,  poker,  happy hour rocks.  Great place for happy hour with friends"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. You can't beat the wing buffet on Friday's for lunch! Fried zucchini and chicken tenders are the best. The Giovanni sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here for 10 years plus.Kaci is the greatest . Love those Giovani wings.If you got a game to watch,make sure this is where you go."}
{"text":"The wings are to die for, atmosphere is nice, crowded but spacious enough to eat and be comfortable. I couldn't see the menu cause it's a little dark. Lol prices are great."}
