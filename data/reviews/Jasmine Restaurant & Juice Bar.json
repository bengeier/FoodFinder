{"text":"One of the few shisha bars around and probably the best one in Mississauga. Clean and big place, pretty good shawarma platter, comfortable. Great selection of drinks, food, and deserts.  The service needs a lot of work and it may be enough to scare people away. The waiters/waitresses have an attitude and they can do a better job.  The place is also pricey, especially if you're there for food, smoke, and beverage.   Overall I'd recommend it if you overlook a couple things."}
{"text":"Not a good place to eat middle eastern food. We ordered fatoosh with chicken. There was hardly any chicken or crispy bread in the salad. It took them for ever to bring the tiny salad. Not impressed with the food or the service."}
{"text":"Very bad rude stuff shisha overpriced  U can not have a shisha without ordering food Or drinks  The girl who works there is very rude  The owner always smokes shisha like 24/7 they don't care about their business! !!  Avoid going there! !!!!"}
{"text":"Food is moderate. The owner is racist and kicked out some women for covering their hair  and cursed them !!!"}
{"text":"unfortunately Markham, and Scarborough need a place like Jasmines.  one night after choosing between El Fishawy and Jasmines, I'm glad I made the right decision.  The dim, intimate ambiance really makes Jasmine's a place to chill out with a wide variety of Arabic dishes, and shisha/hookah to top it off.  The decor and its comfy COMFY low rise booths make this place!!!!  Though they don't serve alcohol, their mint tea is great, along with their ALL VEGGIE platter, though I am a meaty person.  Though its a hike from Markham, its definitely a place worth driving to just to get away from it all lol.....and all those other Ghetto Shisha lounges I have encountered."}
{"text":"Halal Meat is served here.  Verbal assurance from staff and also stated on the menu. Went here on a weeknight where there was very few people. The interior decor of this place is very nice with cushioned booth seating. Very spacious. Tried the Shish Takoosh Wrap (Chicken pieces) which was good. I also tried the Chicken Francissca which was like a chicken sub with cheese. It was very good. Also had fries and the freshly squeezed mango juice. It was good. Friendly service. Note that the Hookah (Sheesha) is tobacco-free, so it's not the \"real thing\", but the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Bad service. No body wants take ur order. Food quantity too little and price is too much. Nice place for big groups. Shawarma tastes nice."}
{"text":"Where shall i start?  So my friend and i was bored and thought of wanting sisha out of the blue.  We came upon across this Juice Bar and swear to my life that i have never been inside.  I have heard that it was good place to hang out during midnight or whatsoever.  So my friend and i head there and of course around 6-7pm....the juice bar was dead.  So i thought maybe thats ok so we have the juice bar to our self....little did i know that when i came in with my friend the owner had us sit where ever we want.   While we were waiting, he handed us some menu.  We were busy looking through the menu and when we were ready to order our sisha and some drinks; the owner was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  he was either at the back of the restaurant or somewhere loafting.  My friend and i kept shouting \"hello\"...and yet no one would answer us.  So i told my friend that we should stay a little more to see where this is going. It's been 30 mins that the owner of this store served a customer a takeout order and not US...(rude). He even went outside to talk to a friend for at least another 20 mins, almost taking my friend and i's time which adds up to about almost an HOUR.   When my friend and i was almost bout to leave, he probably saw us and came up to serve us... I told my friend \"WOW, some service this owner even have\" ... so we ended up staying; had a couple of sisha, had ice cream and just nestea and coke for drinks and DIPPED.   We cashed out and swear i have not given the owner a tip for the over-rall bad service.   I got pass by this restaurant sometimes when i head to work; apparently they're close?  I'm pretty sure they're close for bad business and service that this owner even put with the customers. I don`t even recommend this place if they open a branch somewhere and with the same owner."}
{"text":"Came back here last week since i haven't been in a long time. what a Drastic change! from 4 stars to 1 lonely star.   I was a little bit in a rush, so i just ordered the Jasmine cocktail with a chicken shawarma wrap. The chicken was Way too over seasoned and salty, the wrap had almost no lettuce just pure chicken. I know that's great right? Not this time since the chicken was so salty and seasoned. i just wanted it to end. I ended up not finishing it.  my cocktail was great but unfortunately as for my shawarma didn't make the cut. I really remember Jasmine's being better for the past times iv been here. Also the attention here has gone down. Its just not the same as before."}
{"text":"Think i saw Karl Wolfe professing his love to one of the waitresses while he waited for his hummus plate... Yella Habibi.  All joking aside, the place is nice, allot nicer then most shisha places. The food is good, so is the juice.. hookahs are new the seating is very nice."}
{"text":"Went here a while ago but I have to say this is one of the nicest hookah/shisha cafe's I've been to. The decor makes you feel like you are in another country. I love getting the private booths along the edges of the place. Every time I have gone I have been fortunate not to sit in the center. The low rise booths are comfy and really great to accommodate a group nicely.   They have a great selection in Arabic food to enjoy. I have enjoyed everything I have tried in the past and will continue to explore new items when I return. One thing I always get when I go is the Mint Tea. It is so soothing and a great compliment to the rest of the evening.  The flavour of shisha I normally get is the Jasmine special blend. It is a mixture of many flavours I can't put my finger on. I have not been able to located that flavour anywhere else. You know that feeling you get when you are just so blown away with something? You know the don't fix what isn't broken?? Well that's how I feel when I go here. The only reason I don't go here often is because it is a little out of the way. We definitely need to bring this place EAST!!"}
{"text":"not friendly staff at all.. tge owner is racist he kicked out my friend because of beeing muslim and cursed her appearance as a muslim. In Canada beeing racist is not accepted at all."}
