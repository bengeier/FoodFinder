{"text":"I cake here for the 2nd time (1st time was for a pizza for take out) now trying the dining room. Ordered the Atomic pizza #1 (its like an all-dressed pizza with extra bacon and onions) and we were offered by the nice lady (who's been working here for 15 years apparently) that we could have it with either thin, pan or regular crust. We choose the pan and it is a delight! Fluffy and light thick crust. Pizza was hot and yummy.  The only thing not 5 star is that you have to be a contortionist to get in and out of the men's restroom!!!    You can't miss if you have the pizza!"}
{"text":"Only gave three stars because waitress could have been more friendly and helpful, also, music blaring and couldn't hear the waitress talking in French with Greek accent. And, they were out of gyro! If she would have told us, the Mediterranean appetizer for two was Hugh enough to be called diner, we would not have ordered souvlaki too! Ended up taking our whole dinners back to hotel to microwave the next day! Food was ok but not the greatest Greek I have had."}
{"text":"Went there expecting very good food from all the good reviews and was terribly disappointed,ordered 4 things off the menu and each was worse than the other   Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"I've been to Atomic a couple of times now and I definitely plan to go back again since they offer such a wonderful menu with an authentic Greek touch.  Service was a bit hit and miss with my first visit with my significant other for supper and the other was with a co-worker for lunch giving me a different outlook of how service is given here. The first time service was quick and really friendly and the second time service was a considerably slower and the service more impersonal as we'd like. Maybe it was a bad day but the contrast was notable for me.  Here is the run down of everything I ate :  Souvlaki pita/house salad : Chicken was juicy and flavorful! Pita was generous portion and I really liked how it was prepped with lots of salad and tzatziki! (4 Stars)  Greek Potatoes : Simply aaaaamazing! I really like how they prepared them with their blend of spices and the greek fry cut is totally my thing. (5 Stars)  Poutine : This poutine had waaaaaaaay too much sauce, the fries were soggy and the sauce overwhelmed everything. Some of the parts that didn't have sauce were good as the fries are tasty and with a little gravy you could tell it's not crap. (2 Stars)  Pizza: We ordered an all-dressed pizza and it was decent. I definitely would prefer a meat lovers instead the next time around. Lots of cheese (which is like gold in the pizza industry in this day in age) and the pizza sauce was good. (3 Stars)  Meat Plate : We ordered a nicely sized meat plate that comes with some greek fries that consisted of a number of meats like lamb, pork, filet mignon, chicken & loukaniko (greek sausage). Some meats in this plate was better than others. Pork was quite dry, chicken was decent, filet mignon was good, loukaniko was great and the lamb was just OK (small and fatty). (3 Stars)  Tzatziki : This dip was great! Very garlicky... just the way I love it. :) (5 Stars)  Some hits, some misses but ultimately I was quite pleased with most of what I ate.  Price-tag is decent and has good value for the quality of food provided here."}
{"text":"A very consistent delivery and take out joint. Better than average pizza, subs as well as lamb, pikilia and fried calamari."}
{"text":"This is one of my top Greek restaurants in the Laval area, they serve up a delicious lamb and there portions are large and hey who doesn't like that right.   We always take the hot pikilia platter which contains eggplant spread, feta pepper spread, grape leaves , and a lot of other delicious things. There calamari have to be the biggest calamari I have ever seen they are giant and they are well cooked. we always take there chicken breast platter... It's not dry at all so succulent.  And please do yourself a favour and take the loukomadis... Honey balls for desert they are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very stingy with the portions  Souvlaki pita has hardly any meat in it Tzadziki is good but cost $5 for a tiny cup where other restaurants would charge 75 cents  Pizza is ok 5/10  My wife likes the calamari"}
{"text":"A must try local place. Every time we go we are re-discovering how good this place is. Everything is very tasty and prices are very reasonable."}
