{"text":"Hello All!!

Still freakin delicious!! Husband and I went on down to see the boys behind the counter for two huge plates of shish taouk. The plates are filled up high with salad with amazing dressing, rice, fries, chicken, garlic sauce and pita bread.
This has to be my favorite restaurant in Chateaugauy. The waitresses are so sweet and it's more food you really need, just the way we like it."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since they opened, and have always enjoyed their food, especially their \"Mixed Plate\", which includes Chicken, Pork, Rice, Fries, Tatziki sauce and a greek salad.

The prices have gone up a few times in a short period of time, so I go there for a treat now, rather than several times per week. They recently renovated the location to more than double the seating space. There is partial table service. Once you order at the counter, you then sit down with a number at your table, and they will bring the food to you.

The staff is always friendly, but the service can be a bit slow, especially when most of the customers appear to be phone-ins for delivery, so the kitchen is usually backed up, even if the restaurant is empty. So prepare to have about 20-30 minutes to wait for your food, but when you take  your first bite, you will know it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"..With A  Side of Food Born Illness

      The same people who own Canada Drive In, opened this place, right next door. I guess it was to appease the needs of chateauguay residence who enjoy meat,  cooked slowly, on a spit.

     The food is good, although you are still taking a gamble in regard to cleanliness, they cut corners...they're Greek.

      The shawarma plate is great, their house dressing on the salad is delicious, very 'Mediterranean' and the garlic sauce was imported from some of the freshest garlic farms on the moon colony...oops, I've said too much.

Cheap, fast and greasy with a side of trichinosis nom nom

{"text":"So I moved to Chateauguay and a lot of the restaurants have been disappointing but not Super Gyro. 

The gyro's are fantastic, especially how they cook the pork. The fries are good and did not taste like the oil was old. It`s not cheap to eat here but it's not so terribly over priced.

The staff are nice and the place is clean which is nice.

I tell all my friends and family who visit me here to check this place out, because I ran into a lot of terrible low standard restaurants in this area and I don't want my friends/family to get a bad 1st impression of Chateauguay food."}
