{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is fresh and the service is super friendly.  Mu favorite is the chicken tacos with Mexican rice, pinto beans and lots of poco de gallo.  For dessert, their ice cream is fabulous and refreshing."}
{"text":"We saw this place in the superstition mall and we were starving, so  we gave it a try.  We are addicted to the tostada bowls. The tostada shell melts in your mouth.   Since then we stop and eat here all the time.  The staff is friendly and the food is great. They have specials all the time at a very good price."}
{"text":"Ate for the first time at Ha!banero today and enjoyed the fresh ingredients offered. The window to the kitchen showed the workers busily preparing more meats, veggies and such.   My wife ordered the burrito bowl for $6.50. It had rice, beans, shredded beef, veggies, salsas and all the usual sides like guacamole.   I ordered the tostada bowl with rice, beans, carne rojo (pork with spicy red chilies), cheese, habanero salsa and sour cream.  I got the special which included chips, salsa and a drink for $7.50.   Everything was very fresh, well thought out and delicious. The price for the burrito bowl seemed a touch high but all-in-all: a very good lunch.   Give Ha!banero a try. I think you'll like it as much or better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I'm a mall employee and eat here all the time. The food is fresh, made right in front of you, and the price is great for the portion size. Their habanero salsa is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love it! The girls were nice there and it is like getting a burrito bowl from a taco place. Yummy for sure. They were set up like a chipotle/subway. Menu super clear and readable."}
{"text":"Wow this little place is amazing better than most restaurants and so fast your food is ready so far had a burrito plate and the rolled tacos combo I  recommend the Spanish rice in the whole beans delicious! Every time really nice workers very courteous and professional. A+"}
{"text":"This is the only food court restaurant that I eat at when I'm at the mall.  Great prices and large portions plus the food is delicioso!"}
{"text":"This place has gone way downhill. For one, their LED screen menu wasn't working, so the girl had to describe to me what they had, and I just had to trust them on the prices. When we settled on something that sounded halfway like what I have gotten in the past, she described it as having a candy straw. When I got my item, a \"shaved\" ice with tamarindo, chamoy, and mango, the ice was so lightly saturated, it just tasted bland and watered down. And the ice wasn't even shaved! It was literally big square ice cube after ice cube. The contents didn't even come up to the edge of the cup, despite a domed lid and an almost $6 price tag. After sitting down, I realized I hadn't received my candy straw. When I went back and asked the same girl, she said a candy straw wasn't included and would be 75 cents extra. After she had initially said it was included. Forget that. I have gotten this supposedly same thing many times before, and it always came with the candy straw. Besides this being barely edible. This place used to be awesome. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I work at this mall and this is my favorite place to eat- hands down. The service can be a little slow at times but the workers are always nice & ready to answer any questions I may have. They have a rewards program that can save you some money if you become a loyal customer. Food overall tastes delicious 90% of the time, the other 10% I go too late in the evening. I got my co-workers hooked."}
{"text":"This has to be a big day for all businesses in the mall.  You would think they expected this.  However, the restaurant didn't have \"Red Sauce\" to make a burrito.  Instead of suggesting another item, I was told \"Sorry.  Have a nice day.\" and dismissed.  This is the first and last time I will attempt to eat at this restaurant.  There are too many other choices."}
