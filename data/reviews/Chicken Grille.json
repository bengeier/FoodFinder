{"text":"I just returned home with my takeout order of tenders and popcorn chicken and saw a public hair inside the popcorn chicken container. As if this wasn't bad enough, we called and asked for a refund of the popcorn chicken, and the order taker called the owner, and the owner would not refund the money unless we brought the food back. I would recommend going anywhere else. This place is disgusting and the owner is obviously an asshole."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible. I ordered the six piece tenders with hush puppies, fries, honey mustard and buffalo sauce. I received five tenders, no fries, and no sauce except mayonnaise. Because I ordered pickup, I did not realize the mistake until I was already home. I was charged $8 for a completely incorrect meal. Food was ok, I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new place which replaced a mediterranean style restaurant about 2 months ago. I had previously gone to the said mediterranean restaurant, so when this popped up I was curious and gave it a try.

Upon entering the restaurant, one discovers a fairly unassuming casual atmosphere. The people behind the counter are quick to greet you and friendly so that is a plus. After looking at the menu (which is half Cuban style food and sandwiches and half Chicken), I decided on the cuban sandwich.

The sandwich did not disappoint as it was flavorful and the portion was large. It was a bit greasy, but what else can you expect from a panini-grilled Cuban sandwich. I would do it again when I'm in the mood for something not exactly healthy. 

I have not yet had the chance to try anything from the chicken portion of the menu."}
{"text":"As a student in the area, tenders is extremely convenient and used to be one of my top lunch choices (seriously, 2-3 times a week), however, I stopped in this week to find out that they completely changed their menu. They removed all Cuban items from their menu and the pictures on here are no longer menu options. They also removed a large number of their sandwiches and dinners so all that's left are the greasy, fried tender meals and some mediocre Asian food (on a street that already has 4 other established Asian restaurants, mind you). If it remains this way, I do not foresee myself or the group of people that I always went with ever eating here again."}
{"text":"Fried wings are good. They fry twice so it is vey crispy Ann hot. I would like to try Japanese curry with katsu next time."}
{"text":"I got the 4-piece tenders meal with honey mustard and paid a little extra for sweet potato fries as the side. It came with a piece of buttered garlic bread. It was the perfect amount of food. Chicken tenders and sweet potato fries are pretty much my chosen comfort foods so I'm glad I found a place close to my work where I can get both of those items as a meal. I called ahead to order and it was ready in 5-10 minutes. The person who answered the phone and cashed me out was friendly. I would have never thought to go here, but I read some okay reviews and decided to give it a shot. I'll definitely come back for the tenders."}
{"text":"Favorite cheap lunch place in Oakland.  Teryaki chicken and Havana wrap all the way home!"}
{"text":"Love the popcorn chicken. Fried wings.Tenders all good fresh and crisp..tater tots crisp..all made to order..nothing sitting around..love it."}
{"text":"Don't get a Cuban veggie wrap. It falls apart and is not very good. Probably would be difficult to do well, but this did not come close. Maduros were pretty good."}
{"text":"I had quite the lunch adventure today and this was where it ended. I was going to get tacos but that didn't work out. So decided I would try for a gyro. When I showed up to said gyro place I found Tender instead. There is a menu posted in the window so I took a look and thought I would try a sandwich. There is kind of 2 menues to this place. One is the chicken side and the other is the Cuban sandwich side. It almost feels like ordering off of a secret menu but it's not. 

Upon entering I found a few small tables set up and an ordering counter. I asked the girl what was good. She responded with what are you in the mood for and gave a bit of a list. I said a sandwich. Her response was the Cuban or the Bay Of Pigs if you like spicy. I said I like spicy let's go with the Bay Of Pigs and got a side of fries as well. 

It took ten min for my food to come out. While waiting I found out they are about a month old and have no pics tips or reviews on here so of course I was going to remedy that. The girl behind the counter brought me out my food and I have to say my sandwich was much larger then I had expected. I enjoyed the sandwich. The meats were flavorful and the cheese added a much needed contrast to the spice of the meats and the sauce.  I also enjoyed the fries. They were the generic store bought kind but they were fresh and crispy and not overly salted. 

I had also heard the girl at the counter say there was additional seating up stairs. So once I was done with my food I went up to check it out. Now I must say the stairs are a bit iffy so watch your step and be careful when you come down. That first step is larger then it looks. The upstairs space is nice. It even has a water dispenser and cups set up. Along with a table of condiments. Basically I wish I would have headed up stairs to eat but no big deal. I would love to come back and try something else. Maybe some tenders."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a few days ago and tried their breaded wings and again tonight for their naked wings.

The hot buffalo sauce is pretty darn good, and it's about the closest thing to my hometown's version of hot wings, which I had missed a lot. It's a small little restaurant and easy to miss, but a must see if you want some good wings. Also, love the tator tots and garlic bread."}
{"text":"I stopped by Tenders on Thurs. evening with CM for a quick dinner.  Having tried and enjoyed the Cuban sandwich at Black Bean, I was eager to try one of the Cuban dinners from this new establishment run by the same owners.

Seeing an unfamiliar dish listed as picadillo on the menu, I asked the woman working what it was, and she told me it was seasoned pork.  It sounded interesting to me, so I decided to order the meal version of it ($9.99), and CM went with the fried fish dinner ($9.99).  However, when the dish was brought to me, the meat turned out to be ground beef, which is the epitome of meats that I won't touch with a ten foot pole.  I told the woman who had taken my order, who brought our meals to us, that I don't eat beef, and she looked mortified.  I asked her if she could bring me some of the roast pork instead, and she eagerly did so free of charge.  I just wish she would have checked with me about picadillo being beef-based instead of pork-based, which would have prevented it from being wasted (CM tried it, but wasn't a fan, so that's unfortunately what happened).

Each of the meals came with rice and beans, fried plantains, and some kind of buttered toast, plus the entree that we'd ordered--a decent amount of food for the money.  The pork was of the pulled variety, and was okay, but parts of it were too fatty and dried out to eat, and I found it underseasoned.  (Not sure if the version I received is how it's typically served on a platter, since it was a last-minute substitution.)  The addition of some hot sauce helped to add some flavor.  I tried a bite of CM's fish, and thought it was better than the pork.  As for the sides, we both really enjoyed the toast. Incidentally, neither of us are huge fans of plantains (we don't like sweet foods as part of a meal--as opposed to for dessert), but we tried them, and they were good.  The rice and beans was nothing special--just a scoop of white rice with some black beans on top--and were also underseasoned, such that I added salt and pepper to them, which helped.

My favorite part of the meal, by far, was the fried cookie dough that we ordered for dessert ($3.99).  Having checked out the photos prior to coming, I saw photos of it and decided that I wanted to try it, and CM obliged, sharing it with me.  It consisted of three large balls about 4\" in diameter, ideal for splitting between 2-3 people.  If you've never tried fried cookie dough before, like me, it's amazing!  It was fried long enough to produce a crispy exterior and a cooked rind, while the interior stayed delightfully warm and gooey.  Fried Oreos and candy bars are also available for dessert as well.

Overall, we were pleased with our quick dinner at Tenders.  While I found my meal somewhat inconsistent in quality, I suspect that if I ordered something else, such as the chicken or fish, or a sandwich, it would have been more consistent.  I'll have to visit another time for lunch to see if they can earn a fourth star--though I'm tempted to up the rating based on the fried cookie dough alone, which I may also be back for soon!  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"An interesting mix of menu options but some of the best chicken tenders I've had! You can get a huge meal enough for two people for around $10 which is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly filling.  After much debate with coworkers where we should get food from, a yelp search and some stomach grumbling, we decided on this place.  None of use had heard of this place before, but sometimes that is a good thing such is the case for here.

After looking over the menu we each decided on our choices, I opted for the six piece meal that came with two sides and two sauces for no other reason than I was being greedy that day.  These are not your typical tenders, they are actually better if I may say so myself.  Longer than most tenders you come across when you go elsewhere.  I really think they should have called this place Strips...wait, that would sound bad and make this place sound like a whole different type of establishment than it is.  Breaded and seasoned perfectly and the right size to be able to dip all the way to the end, no need to tear them apart.  The sides were equally satisfying.  I decided, since I was being greedy, to get a double side of tater tots.  I am not sure what it is about tater tots, but I am obsessed with them.  That's why this place was surprisingly filling.  I only opted for the barbeque sauce for my dipping.  Each order also comes with you generic piece of Texas garlic toast.

Now, asides from parking, here is the downside.  If you are choosing to eat in, make sure you are only dining with one other person or alone.  The inside of this place is rather small, with only about three or four two seater tables for dining in.  Unless you plan on eating quickly, I suggest taking your food to go.**

**I just found out that there is an upstairs seating area, I was not aware of this, so if you want to dine in, head upstairs.  My bad."}
{"text":"Very solid place. Went over for lunch and ordered tenders as well as popcorn chicken. Both were delicious and the flavors were distinctly different, despite both being basically fried breaded chicken pieces. Price is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"While looking to try somewhere new for dinner in Oakland, I came across Tenders on Yelp.  A place that basically sells chicken tenders made a thousand ways?  Sure!

I ordered the Tenders Sub ($6.49).  It was fried chicken, iceberg lettuce, cheese, and their special sauce.  The chicken tenders were awesome with a lightly-fried breading.  Unfortunately, the lettuce was really yellow, which was a big turn off.  The other downside was that a tiny bottled juice was $2.50.  Considering that only the quality of the chicken was above that of a McDonalds, I was a little underwhelmed by the meal.

I would come back and order the tenders meal, but I am not rushing to get back.  They do accept credit.

*There does not appear to be air conditioning!  Be careful coming here on a hot day."}
{"text":"Unless there's a secret menu thing going on here, it seems that the Cuban menu has been taken out! Fried chicken in all its forms is still the main offering of course, but in lieu of the former, which has been around since its opening, the main non-chicken items seem to be grilled Asian dishes, namely teriyaki rice and soba (really, lo mein). It's pretty clear that they are targeting Chinese students as well, with their new menu translations and items. I have no doubt that this was an economically optimal decision for them to make, but it does make me a bit sad since the Cuban items were actually decent and rather unique in the area. On their new teriyaki chicken and seafood noodles, which we tried recently, they have to be commended on the large portion size for the extremely cheap price, which makes obvious their competition with Sichuan Express next door. Quality is okay--lots of taste, but a bit too much on the teriyaki sauce. No doubt a good bargain for students overall."}
{"text":"Delicious food, I tried their teriyaki chicken and wrap, both taste good and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"The four piece chicken meal was awesome. Yes the tenders are on the smaller size but they are fresh and lightly fried. The breading was on the spicy side but was really, really, really, good. The meal only came with one sauce but you can purchase more for a little extra. I got to try the fried pickles and an empanada, too. Yum. The empanada is spicy!! So be prepared for that. The pickles are good, not outstanding but still good. 

The meal came with a side, I picked the salad, which had lettuce, croutons, and cheese. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and I've never been disappointed. The entrees come with a decent amount of food and the sauces aren't bad either. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I came back here after having not the greatest experience with my first asian bento. I decided to come back and give it another try. I ordered the marinated beef, this time the bento was so much better! The portion of rice and sides was just right. Unlike last time, I finished the food so quickly and had a food coma. :p The sides were very average, but the marinated beef was delicious. 
The customer service was great, they were very friendly. Tenders take customers feedback seriously I can definitely tell from last time I came, my experience this time is much improved. I will have to come back and give it another try. They just started selling the asian bentos and I already heard their curry is phenomenal. That's what I'll try next time. I'm excited to see what they offer in the future."}
