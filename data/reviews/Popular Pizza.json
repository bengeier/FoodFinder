{"text":"Great pizza and chicken wings from this place is heavenly. It's fast service and really cheap :) although one or two of the employees are kind of creepy lol not sure if they still work there"}
{"text":"Unreal this place sucks sooo bad, no cheese, and they charged us for two topping for chicken but when we got it had couple of small chicken pieces..Don't waste your money.. Spend $5 more bucks and go to pizza Nova..."}
{"text":"Not sure about this location, but the one that just opened up in Georgetown (can't find it on Yelp yet) is AMAZING! Absolute best bang for buck and best take-out pizza for sure! Not sure it can rival with Pizza Hut but at the price and speed aswell as taste none can rival it. Try a medium chicken pizza for $5 and tell me I'm wrong! Go and try it, seriously like wow. Went second time week after to make sure it wasn't a first time hungry man review either lol"}
{"text":"This pizza is crap and make me sick... Where is the tomato sauce where is the flavour gosh!!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favourite pizza spot in gta. I tried ordering an indian style pizza from here a couple of years back, at the time it was only decent. But under the new ownership this has become my favourite. It is never over or undercooked, their service is great as well and the owner is very attentive to customers. I recommend this location to everyone. Chicken wings here are mouth watering and totally addicting they beat anything from wild wings both in taste and price."}
{"text":"i like the pizza,they are usually quick to serve and and make your order,no real complaints i'll go again!"}
{"text":"There pizza is gooooddd no doubt about that but their customer service is as poor as it could get. We order the pizza for delivery the guy brought the pizza after 45 mins no I ain't lying he was tipped well all goody goody and he leaves but there was no dipping  sauce in the box we called the location n he tells me that he will have the dipping sauce delivered quick ( rubbish) 25 mins down nothing comes than they won't ans the phone didn't offer to replace the cold pizza with the fresh one n dipping sauce. I'll rather go to the location and pick my pizza going forward than ordering the delivery. Get a grip popular pizza you guys won't be popular for long if this kinda stuff continues."}
{"text":"Stopped by again with some colleagues from work.  Slice had very few toppings and was overcooked.  Too much dough.  I don't know about you, but when it comes to pizza I would gauge the quality of a pizza based on a slice I order.  A business should think of their slices as 'business card' or 'flyer' that goes out.  And if the quality of their slices is any indicator of the quality of their pizza, I won't be ordering a pizza from here.  I know the business is located close to a high school, but when I see the staff being rude (as I have more than once) to high school students I just think of what big mouths those kids have!  If you treated them right, I'll bet you'd have more business than you knew what to do with."}
{"text":"This location of Popular Pizza is fully halal. I liked their pizza as its not tooooo muccchhh dough or sauce or cheese; they have the right amount.  They also have whole wheat option which I like with popular pizza. I ordered 3 medium pizza with 3 toppings on them. The pizzas were done nice and weren't burn, as for the topping they didn't go cheap on any topping and the pizza's had the right amount. The also have some free toppings like garlic, ginger etc...  The price point is not that cheap but isnt that expensive either."}
{"text":"My wife and I were curious to try this place out since we received their flyer/coupons in the mail recently (first time we've seen it).  The service is a tad on the slow side, possibly ordering ahead may yield in better service times.  We ordered their 4-pack of sides special for $24.99 + HST and we ordered 2 slices as well for $1.50 each + HST.  Their process for cooking/baking the 4-pack of sides took over 20 minutes, when the cashier said the wait time would be 15 minutes.  All the 4 side dishes were baked (potato wedges/12 wings with honey garlic sauce/12 boneless wings with BBQ sauce/Onion rings).  Took so long, let alone the 2 pizza slices we ordered (1 cheese slice & 1 veggie slice) which had to be warmed 2x since they took so darn long getting the 4-pack special done.  By the time we got home..only the 12 wings with honey garlic sauce was still hot.  Everything else had gotten cold and we only live 6 minutes away.  Seems that the boneless wings were cooked first, since those were the coldest out of the 4, 2nd was the onion rings, the potato wedges were semi-warm (guess it was the 3rd item baked).  On a side note after checking receipt when we arrived home, we learned they over charged us on the on the slices.  ($1.50 x 2) + 13% = $3.39, we were charged $3.50  I would recommend checking your receipt against what you ordered if you visit.  If they over charged on a small 2 slice order..they may do similar on a larger order.  We didn't order a full sized pizza, so unable to comment on that.  Seems that other Google foodies that have reviewed have given positive comments.  May make a future visit to try out their Butter chicken pizza for a change of pace from our normal order of hawaiian pizza.    For the moment our go to pizza shop is still Regino's Pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizze. Very small place but perfect for a quick take out. Bang for your buck for sure."}
{"text":"This place sucks, I am sorry but it does, we have ordered deliveries and takeouts both times no quality or taste, if you are doing a in store pick they also have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE   yes i know they are Halal and they have Tandoor chicken Topping, but I rather make my own pita bread pizza at home then order from them   I would stay away   Thank you for reading   PS if you only eat Halal and you have no other options, then go for it"}
{"text":"Order pizza every couple of weeks, and I have to say this place is always quick and efficient & tastes amazing every single time! Definitely recommend all the locals in the area to try it out"}
{"text":"\"Popular\" with whom? Flabby crust, awful sauce, skimpy toppings. And that's just the \"normal\" pizzas.  The entire concept of Punjabi pizza is right up there with KFC sushi...forget it."}
{"text":"Walked in for a couple of slices of pizza. They had cheese and veggie available only, but I didn't mind. The price was great $1.50 each slice. Seems like a great, economical place to go to. Service was great. Menu specials look like you're getting your value's  worth. Will be back again to try out more items, especially their Tandoori and Butter chicken pizzas."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza ever! It is always so flavourful and baked to perfection. The staff is friendly and takes excellent care to prepare your pizza just how you like it. They put a generous amount of cheese and toppings on the pizza so it is worth every penny you spend on it. They include a free dipping sauce for every pizza you order which is very nice of them considering that other pizza chains make you pay for even one container of dipping sauce. Their creamy garlic sauce is super tasty!   The only thing that annoys me is their limited delivery range. They only deliver to residences within 10 km of their location which is not good customer service. What if someone from North York, for instance, is unable to pick up their order for any reason? Should that customer have to call in extra favours just to eat? I don't think so. I think that Popular Pizza should expand their delivery ranges like the other competing pizza chains to attract more customers."}
{"text":"Ordered wedges and a hot chicken sub through  delivery just now and the potato wedges are burnt! Wtf?  The sub has barely any chicken in it. The chicken is the tiny cut up red toppings. Never again!"}
{"text":"A small place next door is my favourite (BB), but kids prefer pizza. So we have a win-win situation here. Order a pizza and meanwhile the pizza gets ready, go get you preferred food. Gethmie the food and pizza is ready.   Kids like pizza, not matter from where it is, and this is no exception. For $10 all taxes in, one topping large pizza with a dip. You just can't go wrong.   Not this time, but previously kids l tried Shahi Paneer pizza (butter chicken style sauce, but with paneer (farmers cottage cheese).   The toppings are topped right- no compromise."}
{"text":"Had a team event of mostly individuals who loved pizza and some of them liked the spicy taste that some pizza stores make. As I was near to this location, this place fitted the requirements.   For about $15 bucks including taxes you get an XL pizza with 3 toppings. Decided to go with Tandoori Chicken (counts as two toppings) and Onions and the other one as Green Peppers, Onions and Mushrooms as the other. The place lacks good customer service staff as you could barely understand the girl as she spoke English poorly.   The pizza was ready very quickly and just from my observations, the Tandoori Chicken looked a little less, otherwise all toppings and cheese seemed good.   The proof was in the pudding - all slices were gone in a few minutes. Either the team was hungry or the pizza was good, as none of them complained."}
{"text":"Horrible! The pan pizza tastes bitter/full of chemicals. Gross!  The fries: Stay away. Literally so under cooked that u can taste the raw potato.Disgusting.  Stick with the other brands, this is by far the worst pizza in the area."}
{"text":"They cook their pizza to perfection. They even check and review the order twice before giving it to their customer. I saw them doing this myself. They make sure that the customer gets their moneys worth. I order pizza from them occasionally and today i ordered their panzerotti for the first time and it was a pleasant surprise. The dough was definitely not over powering like i see in other pizza places and it was cooked and did not feel raw. The food felt comforting. Defiantly I would visit this place over and over again!"}
{"text":"This location is very badly managed, and the manger is very rude and arrogant. The pizza wasn't even displayed before being handed over, even when asked to do so, by the customer. The reason being there weren't enough toppings on it. When asked why, the manager said take it if you want to. Never going back to Popular Pizza again, because of this incident!"}
{"text":"Never buy pizza from here its the worst uncooked pizza you will eat. Even if you call them the explaining your pizza was shit they will get mad on you for calling and informing them"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for some walk-in takeout pizza with some friends. It is on the edge of a strip plaza. The inside is nothing to rave about, very simple, large in-your-face posters about their specials and bright fluorescent lighting. It was full of pre-teens and suburban teenagers, asking you to buy cigarettes for them at the convenient store next door.   With that aside, It was 2 medium pizzas for $11.99. We got 1 with pepperoni and 1 with mild sausage and mushrooms. The wait was about 15 minutes as we watched the open kitchen make the pizzas. The pizza itself was ok, not amazing but decent. The crust was a bit thick for my liking but it felt fresh and had a good amount of toppings. Would go again just because it is close by and it's cheap."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and great service!   Came in close to closing and customer service was really good. Pizza was ready in exactly 15 minutes as we were told.  The spot is mostly for takeout but they do have a bar slab with two high chairs if you need to stay there and eat.    Try the Indian style :)"}
{"text":"The owner touches a bunch of non food items and places orders on the phone then gets back to continuing making the pizza. Gross. The older gentleman who delivers came back and went directly to making pizza without washing his hands."}
{"text":"The pizza in this place is hit or miss. Some time its good, and other times the skimp on the toppings. But they have a worthwhile wall in special."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered a whole pizza here, but I have come for slices a number of times. Decent variety of slices (cheese, veggie, pepperoni, etc) at a low price ($2 each). Not the best pizza but not bad either. Decent dining area if you want to eat in, but it's mainly takeout and delivery. I come because it's local, but other than that, there's no great attraction. Halal options available."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever eaten. If I can give it a 0 start I would. I don't know what happened to this place I used to crave there pizzas I don't know if the owners changed but they cheap out on toppings, EVEN THE CHEESE! We actually had parts of the pizza with no cheese and no sauce! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!"}
{"text":"This is by no means gourmet pizza, but $5 for a small pepperoni pizza I can't complain. It tasted above average and the staff are friendly. I like to support this place when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It's just average pizza to me, it's just good as the price. I agree with some of the other reviews, they don't put a good portion of the toppings, especially for those special items such as paneer, chicken, etc."}
{"text":"Worth spending money at this location.  We buy once a week from this location. We live in caledon but we specially go to this location to picking up the pizza.  We tried the other popular pizza but they are not even 10% compare to this location."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Not only can you get a whole bunch of toppings not offered by other chains, the Punjabi-style finish (garlic, coriander, ginger, chiles) was awesome."}
{"text":"worst pizza ever be ware ... they scam you give you shitty cold card board pizza. then when confronted about it the indian woman on the phone argues with you in broken english refusing to give you another pizza . or refund you. don't ever order from here. worst place ever. .. don't waste your money. i will be letting everyone i know in brampton and georgetown. about there horrible service and pizza. then going to better business bureau. do not come to this country. and ripp off hard working canadians. . poor business ethic. and it will be known."}
{"text":"One of the worst I've had. Pizza was dry, cold and it looked and tasted like it was day-old. On top of that I selected cash for method of payment and the driver shows up with no change to give. (Who does that?) No sir, I will not be giving an 80% tip on this meal. That happens I guess from time to time and does not reflect in the star rating. Would have been a 1 if not for the wings. They were good. Not the flavour I asked for, but good. RIP Pizza place.  Also to be noted. This is 'regular' crust. Not thin crust. (Say what??)"}
{"text":"Once in a while a good pizza really hits the spot....I have long written off the big chains and have been going for the Local Punjabi Pizza places.  Popular pizza opened up close to our house a little while ago and decided to try it today..... MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM man that's some great  PIZZA. The fish i heard is great too!  I got a large three topping for 12$ TAX IN!!!!  Wow what a deal.  Next its the tandoori fish pizza if i want to get my Bollywood on!"}
{"text":"really dislike this place, but sadly its the closest pizza shop within walking distance of my house.   while its halal, it doesnt taste that good, and they barely put any toppings (almost no cheese, crust hella thin)   for the price, its not even that good. pizza pizza is better, pizza pros is better (for halal), but sadly im forced to go here damn"}
{"text":"We typically go for a veggie large pizza. Toppings were great and fresh. I would have loved it more cooked - if they were perhaps baked for some time along with pizza. We went for extra spicy with hot sauce and the addition of garlic, ginger and hot peppers on top - and it delivered well.  Delivery isn't the fastest but still within the time (some other folks end up delivering ahead of time as well, sometimes).  What they don't offer is the option of dairy-free cheese, which is why sometimes we go for PizzaNova or even PizzaPizza. But there is an option to remove the cheese altogether."}
{"text":"This is the most unprofessional and unfriendly call centre I have ever dealt with in my 30 years of customer service experience.  I have never had a good call with them over the past 3  years but why make a franchisee suffer....until now.  Last night I ordered pizza and wings to serve 6 people.  When I arrived at the store to pickup it was closed.  I called the call centre and she took my phone number and proceeded to ask me what I would like to order.  I pointed out she had my order and before I could say anything else she proceeds to tell me it is my fault my order was not processed.  She claimed that I needed to answer the phone to confirm the order first.  I pointed out in three years I have never had to do that and even so how does that change the fact the store was closed.  After quite an arguemnt she tells me the boy (her words) that took the order made a mistake and if I was truly a customer I would have known the store was closed on Monday. Wow Wow Wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Still good pizza.. I tried there potato wedges by accident (I asked for onion rings but they gave me potato wedges instead..)? Mistake / Accident I assume? I always say when it comes to order and food. Things Must be correct.  No big deal though, I would still order from them. I also tried the baked fish.. not sure if it is Salmon or Tilapia fish, as it is seasoned fairly well, yet tasty.. I would definitely order this again. Reason for the 3 stars is because of the mistake in order and I asked for extra sauce on the pizza which they Always do for me.. but this time they slacked. Again no big deal. Still ordering again from them."}
{"text":"Recently ordered by phone and received wrong order. Called the store and the Supervisor was extremely rude and unprofessional. She accused us of lying and said we placed the wrong order. Will never recommend this location to anyone"}
{"text":"OMG this place is the worst with customer service they are super rude on the phone yea I agree the pizza is really good but like seriously learn some manners and communication skills if ur here to run a business"}
{"text":"$1.50 pepperoni pizzas... Not tax! The slice is amazing for the price. It cheap and it's pretty good. They have deluxe slices for $2.00 also no tax. I would definitely go back. Would recommend."}
