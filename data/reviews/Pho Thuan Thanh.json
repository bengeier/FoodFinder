{"text":"The pho was pretty good but the customer service was horrible. Not once did they check and see if the food was good. I waited 15 minutes with my utensils down; I had to get up to the cashier for a to-go cup, and then asked for my check there. I wanted to get boba but didn't feel like giving them anymore of my money. 

And my waitress was yelling across the room and started talking to his friends for a LONG time too. I couldn't wait to get out of there"}
{"text":"This Pho is amazing!  I've been scouring PHO for years and I've been lucky enough to taste different recipes from SLC (yum!) to Corpus Christi (they sucked) to Vegas (yum!) to San Diego (yum!) to here!  I found they are the cheapest but their flavor is amazing!"}
{"text":"Pho Tai and BBQ Pork Banh Mi. Add coffee with condensed milk. You're welcome. I love the flavors at this place. No fake bouillon cubes in the broth. No small plate of sprouts and lime. This is legit Pho in Arizona. I will continue to eat here as often as I can. Extra yummy and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"On Monday the 21st of March I went in with my family to have lunch not only did the place smell bad and had bad customer service in the middle of my meal I saw someone come in who looked like an inspector or something and like 20 minutes later we had to leave due to them being shut down.. THE WORST EXPERIENCE!!' I wish I could give 0 stars.. NEVER EVER GO THERE"}
{"text":"Pho thuan thanh or Da Vang 2 as many call it named as such as it is the second shop after its older brother Da Vang located in Phoenix. A family owned and run business the atmosphere is always bustling as patrons both new and many many long time customers shuffle in and out enjoying the delicious authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Now a days where there seems to be a pho shop in every corner it is hard to find one that really serves authentic cuisine with a family feel environment.  Pho thuan thanh is exactly that and the only pho shop you will find that serves my all time favorite Mi sui Cao. Delicious!!!! My family have been going to Da Vang in Phoenix for the last 12 Years and it's so nice to have a shop of theirs in the East Valley. It is truly a hidden secret."}
{"text":"Decent pho, large portions, and cheap. Service is lacking. Bathrooms are filthy!!! How hard would it be to clean for your customers?!?"}
{"text":"Best vietnamese around! BEST PHO HANDS DOWN. It's a hole in the wall, but those are the best in my opinion. Their noodle bowls, spring and egg rolls, bun xao, and coconut milk dessert are amazing! Reach outside your comfort zone and give this place a try! And its dirt cheap!"}
{"text":"Really it's not as great as people make it out to be. I was truly expecting better service and more authenticity. The service was TERRIBLE. Yes, We may speak different languages, but that doesn't mean you have to be rude and inconsiderate. The food was not the least bit flavorful, but hey, at least it was pretty. The egg roles were disgustingly sticky and warm. ( not Chinese egg roles, but vietnamese ones). Very disappointing, not coming back. Rather. Starve."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.
They are super friendly and very helpful if anyone needs a guide to navigate the expansive menu.
And lastly the prices are phenomenal.     
This is a must go for real Vietnamese food, Phó sho!"}
{"text":"Th e food is really good and cheap/affordable for that kind of price. So yes u will need to accommodate for others bc it's not an expensive restaurant. I've been here with my family many time and the food are all great. They could use better customer services but I dont mind much since I'm here to eat."}
{"text":"First time here today. The ph tai was the perfect size and they don't skimp on the noodles or beef. And the price is right! But my favorite thing about this place is the friendly and welcoming staff. This will be my go to ph place now!"}
{"text":"Great food and inexpensive.  Bun bo hue, beef pho, pork bar. The ground beef grape leaves with the rice paper and lettuce are a fun experience to enjoy. I expect to come back and try other dishes! Clean place the service is not bad. Not Excellent.  But who cares.... remember very inexpensive pho mmmm great for a rany day!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  So happy they are open.  Food is delicious and fresh.  Best of all the price is awesome.  I'm Asian and knows how to cook Pho and other viet food but for 2 people its easier to pay $5.50 and so on ...plus its really really yummy here. If your looking for Real true viet food, this is to die for."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying pho, and I loved it, it was delicious! Also, the space was clean, and the staff were friendly! The one downside was that the store was empty, but the service was still very slow. But overall very good!"}
{"text":"recommend you guys should not come to this restaurant because the food contains a lot of MSG. I got headache and felt thirsty every time I came here. If you care for your health, you should not eat here because MSG is very bad for your health."}
{"text":"Pho Ga was excellent; large portions, great flavor, plenty of add-ins (Thai basil, sprouts, jalapeno, lime). Spring rolls were freshly made, large, and served with awesome fish sauce. Price is about the lowest in the east valley. Given that, I didn't expect the quality of the food to be this good. Pleasant surprise! Food was excellent!! The only negative I can say is about the soda....ordered a diet coke and they served a can with a glass of ice, so no refills. But the food was so good that we'll definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"To be fair, the food here is pretty decent for the most part. However, I could rate the service 0 if there is the option. Plates and bowls of customers who have left sit there for a long time. Let me doubt how bad is their hygiene condition of the back. The restaurant is severely understaffed. I waited 10 mins without anybody taking my order. I have to go to the front desk to place order. When I complained to the owner, she emotionlessly said 'we are busy.' If you are Vietnamese, you might be treated differently. For me, I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place last night.  Ne'er tried pho before, and some friends recommended this place.  We were very impressed.  The portions were great, for the price.  The food was very good.  The service was polite, and welcoming.  I'd highly recommend them to others.  I liked the feel of the establishment, very relaxed and familiarly inviting.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Pregnancy cravings!  Relatives of my fave pho place Phu Thanh (now located at the LeeLee's on the West side).  The menu is a bit different as their style, but I'm enjoyable working thru the menu...  my go to Vietnamese place when the need for more light and healthful hits!"}
{"text":"Great place for pho!  Menu is extensive and very cost friendly.  Service is quick and fast.  Better and cheaper than the other Vietnamese restaurants in the Mekong Plaza..."}
{"text":"The mother wanted some vietnamese food,  specifically this sweet and sour soup and clay pot fish ( canh chua and ca kho ) so we gave this place a try and was a huge disappointment. 

When I first walked in, the smell of the place already threw me off. Even at a bad vietnamese restaurant, you get the delicious pho smell but not here, no delicious smell to match the not so delicious food. 

Anyways we also ordered eggrolls and it only came as 2 in an order and the fresh vegetables that came with it wasn't so fresh. The dipping sauce was on the salty side so was the soup that we ordered so I'm guessing it's a theme. We barely ate the clay pot fish since there was nothing special about it. 

In the end, definitely not worth the 35 dollars spent there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The service is abnormally quick and the food fresh and perfectly authentic... I can't believe I passed this up driving by so many times ... clean restaurant and friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love going to eat here. Hidden restaurant in the back of a plaza behind the dominos. The food really taste authentic. Prices are so cheap. Two big bowls of soup, an appetizer,2 drinks, and Togo pre made food for under 30. 

Banh xeo as an appetizer - crispy Vietnamese crepe.
I got the bun bo hue and my boyfriend got the pho Tai nam. Both great and flavorful. 
Took the mam trung? Togo (not sure if I spelt it right) which is a steamed eggloaf. Very hard to find, I was so happy they had it! 

We will always come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place in town. The prices are very low and the pho is pretty authentic. Service is fast. Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"From the second the door was opened for us and we watched everyone hustling about at high speed with lots of tables pushed together for large family gatherings we knew we scored.   

We actually chose #27 seafood  because we liked the picture and couldn't pronounce it plus I didn't have my glasses to copy it down.  For real.  We lucked out it was almost as good as the picture.

Also had the #2A pho with Beef & vegetables. The spring rolls were so fresh and wonderful.  A must have at this place."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Seattle. I was totally craving good authentic Vietnamese food. This place met my expectations. I ordered pho and the hubs ordered bun. Both were excellent. Place was very clean also. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They are always willing to customize dishes and everything is yummy. Service is great too."}
{"text":"Wow! I thought I was going to have a mediocre experience based in the other reviews, but they proved to be wrong! The food was authentic and the service was awesome. The food is extremely inexpensive! I got the pho 3A special. It was a HUGE bowl for only $5.75! Seriously, this place does not disappoint! The people here were nice too. Ice tea is $0.75."}
{"text":"This place was referred to me by my nail technician who said we'd likely be the only non Asian people there and she was right. The food was really good, fast and inexpensive.  My husband and I had different entrees and loved them both. The service was friendly even though the server clearly didn't understand much of what we said.  This place was also SPOTLESSLY CLEAN which always makes me a fan."}
{"text":"It was really a small faction of Yelp elites that congregated to see if this place is good or just good enough. I myself had not picked this place, but the experience here was just a-okay.

For my own 50 states Pho challenge here in Phoenix, AZ, I met up with 3 other yelp elite members during my stay here in Phoenix for a later than expected lunch in Mesa. Expected to grab the rental car up in Glendale quite fast, but as it turned out, I got to the restaurant about 45 minutes later. We congregated here at the Pho Thuan Thanh Vietnamese restaurant and I was shocked that the prices here were very kind. The prices were pretty amazing and one of the possible causes of the high star yelp rating. A standard bowl of Pho was under $7 and that was a riot! In Honolulu, it tends to be $10 average, so this was certainly great. Although the prices were good, the service was kind of slow and inattentive. I'm sure my lunch companions would agree, especially when we had to wait for someone's fries rice dish to come out 15 minutes after everyone else's food came out.

Eventually, the fried rice dish came out and everyone was happy. 2 people, including me, ordered Pho, which were set in larger than life bowls. It was an extra large bowl with majority of it filled with broth. Maybe I should have ordered extra noodles, but I was content with the bowl and the serving size of noodles in the pho broth. The broth itself was delicious and definitely full of flavor. They give decent amounts of bean sprouts and basil, but there could have been more fun in that bowl, if i had ordered extra. Oh well. Pho Thuan Thanh Vietnamese is located in a strip mall on 502 S Dobson Street in Mesa, AZ. It was about 35 minutes from the airport. There is a private parking lot for all the businesses situated there, so that's a good thing. They accepted major credit cards except the American Express, so that's always a great thing too. As aforementioned before, inattentive service and slow service was observed here with me and my friends.

Although the restaurant itself was a quaint slice of Pho heaven in Mesa, got to admit that it was clean and large enough to hold parties and other functions, if need be. Still, this place can be improved with its service. While the prices here are insanely good for Pho and Vietnamese cuisine in general, I gotta admit that they need to change how they service the customers. They don't give you your check table side, so you'd have to get up and proceed to the counter to pay. Sounds like some Vietnamese restaurants I've been to state side and while in Honolulu. I guess that's how some business models work sometimes.

Regardless if this is just an isolated incident or they actually do this on a consistent basis, I'd probably would recommend this place, considering that the food is delicious and the prices are pretty awesome. This experience was good, but not great.

3.5 stars, but bumped up to 4.0 stars due to the prices.

Support local!

{"text":"Did not know this place was here. Actually ran into one of the workers picking up some ingredients at Mekong market and he ask me to come check them out. Who doesn't like a tasty bowl of number one to get the blood moving.

Located in a tiny strip mall with a serious no frills setting and decor. Inside is large and very basic with several tables to enjoy your meal. Each table comes with all the standard Vietnamese sauces or condiments. Nice!

Been here a few times and normally go with one of their soups and maybe an appetizer. The menu here is rather large with a good variety of different items. Always see a lot of the local Vietnamese foodies coming in and chowing down on some of their favorites.

Usually get here early for lunch. On many occasions the place looked like it was not cleaned the night before or maybe after the morning crowd and several tables are still not ready or set up for service. Hmmm?

Food is rather good and the prices cannot be beat. Just try and pretend you are on a top secret mission and maybe give them a chance to clean up before you get there. It can be hard to enjoy your meal when there is a vibe of panic in the air with them trying to get the place ready.

Definitely recommend checking them out. Service is probably the area they should focus on to improve the overall eating experience. A-OK and then SOME!

3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Today is Thanksgivings day, but they have a terrible custom services by giving us a cold foods and didn't have any words about apology of cold foods that we got so upset! I won't ever be back here for any foods from this place!!!!
I am not recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho places in the valley. The broth is full of flavor. The meat is also of good quality compared to other places. They also serve good sandwiches. It's definitely place to try pho. One to my work so I am kinda regular."}
{"text":"Their original location on Southern and Extension (http://www.yelp.com/biz/phu-thanh-mesa)  is now closed due to a tragic incident that happened back in March 2013 -  an employee was shot by her husband then he shot himself inside the restaurant. It was on the news: (http://www.abc15.com/dpp...)

Anyways, this location is owned by one of the brothers and it's just as good as the old location.  

Be sure to order their Pho #22 with rice noodle. They use quality meat and you wont find anything weird like fish eyeballs in your soup.  It consists of quality thin beef strips, fish meatball (don't let this freak you out...its good), pork wonton, shrimp, crab & squid.

My other favorite is their fresh spring rolls (not fried) that come with Hoisen & Peanut sauce...super cheap & healthy.

They also have another location owned by their sister. It's located on 19th Ave & Camelback (http://www.yelp.com/biz/...)"}
{"text":"After looking and asking where is the best place to get Vietnamese food in the East Valley, this place was a common suggestion by many of my friends. The staff was friendly and nice. They also served the food in a timely manner. I will be going back to try more dishes soon."}
{"text":"This place is a such a disappointment. I walked in and the waiter greeted and such then sat me down. I ordered my food, got my food and never saw his face until I had to walk up to counter to pay. Their service is so rudely straight forward. I ordered their Mi Dac Biet Kho (Dry noodles) and it was so bland! The sauce was like water! Squid was so chewy (taste like fake squid), shrimp was not peeled completely off, and the red meat tasted spoiled. I got the food and was so excited to eat it because it looked so good but it was just a dissatisfying taste. I will never come back here, not for 10$.."}
{"text":"Solid vietnamese.  The catfish soup was solid, sweet and sour and spicy.   Appreciate the lower prices for everything.  Pho under $7.50 and Vermicelli as well.   Mesa is a hub for Vietnamese and Korean."}
{"text":"I usually get the Pho Tai and my fiancé orders the shrimp fried rice. The flavor of the soup is really good. I usually have a craving for it at least once every two weeks. The shrimp fried rice is really good too. One of our favorite places to go for pho and fried rice."}
{"text":"So inexpensive, so authentic and the folks working are so welcoming and good to me when I go in. A fave pho place"}
{"text":"Good pho soup. The menu has a huge variety other than pho. It's inexpensive. The service was fast and friendly. Only thing that could be better was the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Being from Houston, I got spoiled when it comes to good Vietnamese food. Pho Thuan Thanh is by far the best that I have found in the area. Their pho broth is flavorful, and I recommend the lemongrass chicken if you're not in the mood for soup. The prices cannot be beaten either! My only issue is that their noodles tend to be a bit clumpy/chewy. Overall, an excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"I walked im wanting pho soup, i usually go to unforgettable. unfortunately they close at 8 i went to this place because they close at 9. it was obviously before 9 and was greeted by a very rude man that told me they \"flow\" at 9. finally we dicephered he was saying close at 9.. he never removed his toothpick from his mouth. I wish i could review the food, but we were not allowed to order because they closed \"flow\" at 9. service wise i was very diappointed and will not return due to this."}
{"text":"The prices for the food are very reasonable here but with that said I thought the food here was just OK. I tried their Pho noodle soup and their Banh Mi sandwich, nothing much really stood out for me. The service here was not particularly great as well as it did take a long time for my water to be refilled however that can be typical of Vietnamese restaurants so that doesn't necessarily surprise me too much.

Pho Thuan Thanh is an okay option but I was really hoping that the food would have been better. I'd like to try their rice plates here sometime as I haven't had them yet."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi here is great, but everything else is mediocre. This used to be one of my favorite place when they first opened but the quality had gone down since, they upped the price on a lot of noodle soup but they put more meat and condiments in it. But QUALITY OVER QUANTITY by putting more food in it but the flavor is so bland then it's just a waste. The Pho is mediocre but over all the price is average. The service is slow even though the restaurant is not even packed, we waited over 20 mins for our food and found out they lost our orders. Im Vietnamese so I can hear them from the kitchen. When the food came out MY BOWL BARELY HAVE ANY NOODLES OR MEAT I HAD 2 SPOON AND THAT WAS MY $7.50 BOWL AND THE RESTAURANT IS UNCLEAN SO THERES FLIES ALL OVER THE PLACE AND YOUR FOOD. The most horrifying part was the kitchen staff came out and STARTED ARGUING WITH THE SERVERS IN VIETNAMESE IT WAS CHAOS. Don't give them attitude for sure they'll DO SOMETHING TO YOUR FOOD. Honestly disappointing DONT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT BAD SERVICE AND OVERPRICED FOOD."}
{"text":"I wasn't happy when I sat down. Really, not at all... There was no water offered, no service for first 15mins, and I got completely ignored until I flag some one down asking for certain things. But I'm willing to leave this place 4 stars for a couple of reasons. 

First off, this is not a fancy place where servers wear uniform and candles are lighted. Indeed, it's a small stop shop like mom and pop place, more like a down to earth restaurant that welcomes you anytime, no matter what status you're carrying. If you want something, you ask for it. It's certainly not a place where you expect to meet your partner on a first blind date, nor should you celebrate your 50th anniversary. I was given what I asked for within a blink of an eye, so... At least I was okay with it.

Secondly, food are \"oddly\" good, and I totally mean it. Pho Dac Biet and Bun Bo Hue were quite delish, and Banh Hoi Chao Tom came out briefly. I give it 2 thumps up due to the quick serving time, and the quality was just as good. 

Thirdly, they have amazing staff. Staff never failed to conquer your request. As I said before, if you want it, you ask for it. Servers were super friendly and attentive. Sometimes it's hard to get them since the restaurant can be busy with short of staff, but you still can get what you order. In this case, I'm fine.

I got in grumpy, but I came out happy. That is enough for me to keep it rolling and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Our family has been getting our Pho from Unphogetable...not the best but the best among the 3 we have tried in Phoenix.  We decided to continue our search tonight, so we checked Yelp for recommendation.  
This place is legit.  It reminds me of the Pho we ate in Chicago Vietnamese neighborhood.  And when we look at the price...what?  $6 for a bowl of beef Pho?  The pork chop is insanely good!  We ordered 2 noodles and an appetizer and our bill is $17.02!  Seriously?  SO CHEAP!
Why I only give it 4 stars compare to 5...like other Asian restaurant, it is a little dirty (again, typical) but I hope they read these reviews and do a better job on keeping the place clean and neat.  
Highly recommended if you want good Pho.  If you think Unphogetable is good, you have to try this one."}
{"text":"Best pho, egg rolls & bahn mi ever!  We drive 2 1/2 hours to eat here!  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"One of the better pho spots on the east side my only qualm is sometimes the broth is inconsistent but its definitely better than some of the other places nearby. I had their Hu Tieu banh lon kho last time I stopped by and it was actually pretty good. My friends usually get the com bo nuong which I would get if I was more of a rice dish person. The plaza is real easy to miss too I usually tell people to turn in at the domino's as a landmark and the parking lot isn't the greatest in the world."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since summer time and finally got my dad to try it.  My grandmother had a couple vietnamese restaurants in the Philippines when my dad was growing up and he says this is the best and is just like grandma's! This place is delicious, the pho is exceptional (the first place I didn't feel the need to add hoisin sauce), their vietnamese sandwiches are delish, and mine and my family's favorite is #81 banh cuon...this is the best place for that dish, not a lot of places make it, the only other one i can think of is at the vietnamese place attached to Lee Lee's in Chandler but it is subpar.  I was told this dish was my grandmother's signature at her restaurant.  I just love love love this place.  I think within a month my dad has invited me to eat here almost 15 times! Im excited to take my white friend with today!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for a few years now, and the Pho is consistently good, the prices are great, and the staff are nice.  I try something new on the menu regularly, and I have not been disappointed yet. This is my go-to neighborhood Pho place."}
{"text":"This an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, so you need to be open to experience the difference of the \"commercial\" Pho, you will not find it here.
Food was good, staff is very friendly, but I'm taking out 1 star because the restroom was dirty and the kids high chair very sticky 

Overall good experience if you don't use the restroom and bring disinfecting wipes for the high chair."}

Most dishes under $10!  
Beef pho had a great beef broth n generous portions of beef n noodles. 
1 minus they do need to devein their shrimp. 
Otherwise fast n friendly service for good food 
We'll be back."}
{"text":"Freaking love this place!  Ok, so the price, you CANT BEAT!  The food is amazing...best pho I've had,  and huge portions!  The people are friendly and welcoming....however this is a pretty authentic hole in the wall Vietnamese place so there can be a language barrier depending on who your server is, and service is definitely not the best and the atmosphere is nothing to write home about.  But if you are just looking for great authentic food at great prices, without having to feel like dressing up to go out, and you aren't a snob that expects the restaurant to revolve around you, go here.  They are nice people, and it's great to help local businesses and families.  the only reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is the atmosphere and service isn't what most American's are used to."}
{"text":"This place deserves some recognition. I've been coming here for a while and they've been so consistent I think they deserve it.. The Pho is the best I've had all over Phoenix and I've tried it all over including a hand full of places in so cal.. The portions are generous and the quality is excellent. Come give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great flavor, I got the #1, the works pho. Only paid $5.50! So my wallet had a good time as well. Service was good, they left me alone and let me enjoy but were constantly glancing over to see if I was doing fine, what more can a single diner need? Overall, cheap, tasty, extremely satisfying portion. I am now a returning guest! Hope to bring my friends and family in as well!"}
{"text":"Call me a traitor.  But for those that loved phu thanh in mesa, before they closed down, this place is IDENTICAL as far as quality and price for food.

I used to drive to peoria for phu thanh, but I think I found my spot!!

This place looks exactly like the ones in cali, all those upscale pho places are pretty shitty, over priced, and watered down pho.

The pho at this place is by far the best broth ever!"}
{"text":"I discovered Pho (check Wiki) 25 years ago when I was living in Honolulu. I later moved to  L.A., NYC,  & San Diego, always finding \"my style\" of Pho after a short search. While Pho styles are very personal, what's even more important is day to day consistency. The best places are all about the food, don't get turned off by the ambiance.

To say I have been lost since Phu Thanh on Southern Ave closed down last year is an understatement. I wandered around the East Valley checking every Pho restaurant for a new place to get my fix. All in vain!

Well thank goodness Pho Thuan Thanh opened, hiding behind a Domino's on the SW Corner of Broadway and Dobson. There are 11 brothers and sisters in Thanh family, the #7 son ran the Southern location (now at the Peoria location) The #6 sister is the chef at this new Dobson location. 

Dare I say everything tastes about one star better.

While Pho is great place to start your adventure with Vietnamese food, its just the tip of the iceberg, the vast menu at Pho Thanh will open a whole new world of culinary exploration.

Tip in ... and dig on in ...................
 
Pho-licious!"}
{"text":"It's located in a tiny plaza that's a little difficult to find, but I'm not complaining because it's the cheapest pho I've ever had! It's $5.50 for a regular sized bowl, and it comes with all the regular fixings! The portions are really big (especially for the XL size which is only $7) and the broth is tasty. Another reason I'm a fan: They have an option that only includes rare steak and tripe in your pho. (3D) Considering I'm a huge fan of tripe but not the other additional pho meats, it's the perfect option for me! 
Also tried their spring rolls, which were $2.00 for an order of 2. Amazing how cheap it is, given that the quality is on par with what you would expect form a fancier establishment. 
Overall, it's a no-frills restaurant that serves up good pho at extremely low prices!"}
{"text":"I've had better pho. The customer service was alright. The food did come out in a timely matter."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Opposed to what others had said, the place was clean and neat.  The spring rolls were large and delicious.  I had a bbq pork banh mi (sandwich on wonderful crusty roll) and beef pho and my son had their pho No. 1.  He frequently eats Vietnamese food and thought it was one of the best he has tasted. We split the sandwich and dipped it in the pho so I guess you could call it a Vietnamese Dip!  Service was fine and attentive.  The prices were more than reasonable and we plan to return."}
{"text":"Good rice dishes here... 

I like the beef and egg rice plate here, I don't know the Vietnamese name for it but it is great. 

I didn't really like the pho though. The broth had a strange dish soap like taste to it so I never tried it there again. 

The owner is really friendly and the prices are fair. 

Good lunch spot... Pretty far from where I am though...."}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh food; fast service and nice staff! We tried things other than pho at this restaurant and pleasantly surprised !"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been about 30 times over the course of 4 years. 

Pho tai is what I order. The to go orders are much smaller, so I'd recommend dining-in."}
{"text":"They took forever for my order not friendly and dirty. ..they didnt come ask if we need to order something. .food not that good...I swear im not gonna come back anymore...nth compare to pho in California."}
{"text":"I've had two very different experiences with food here.  The first time, I got a pho, com tam, and a bun (a noodle soup, rice dish, and a noodle bowl) which were all great.  The second time, I got wonton and bunreu, and both soups were just not very good.  Something didn't taste right with the soup bases.  All soups come with a side dish of raw bean sprouts, herbs (specific to the soup), lime, and jalapenos. The veggies were all very fresh and nicely cleaned."}
{"text":"Probably my new go to Pho place. Pretty close to where I'm living. Definitely the best price that I have seen in awhile. Regular bowl, they only have one size, of pho tai for only $6. You can get additional noodles for a dollar more. You can also get more beef if you wanted for i think one or two dollars. Overall, this price is unbeatable for this time and age. With regards to the broth, I would say it is it has a more clean, not as thick, and less oily, compared to other places, taste to it. Definitely not broth medicine bag made. Usual being sprout, lime, jalapeno like all the other places. No issues there. Bonus point that have the hot chili that I like and not just the usual sriracha.

 Inside has pretty good seating, lots of tables. Easy parking lot outside. Service is pretty fast. Place is pretty clean. Would definitely recommend everybody to come check it out.

 Will be my go-to spot for now."}
{"text":"This is definitely a spot that reminds of school when I would venturing into those run down Pho restaurants in LA. 

I came here with some friends for dinner and I was craving Pho all day.  Chilly PHX night so I was ready.  I went the big boy Pho or the 2B as they call it.  Combo of beef tendon, tripe, beef balls, and rare steak.  The 2B indeed was large in size and took my some time to consume it.  The broth which really makes or breaks it for me was a tad bit too sweet for my taste.  All the other ingredients was cooked to perfection as I loaded it up with the bean sprouts, jalapenos and basil leaves.  Overall, if I was totally hungry and feeling cheap; this would be the spot.  For what I ordered at only $8.00 a bowl; a large bowl!  That's what I call value!  

In the end, Pho Thuan Thanh pho is not my cup of tea since it's too sweet.  However, for the price it's definitely worthwhile to stop by.  The place is somewhat in a shady spot.  This is definitely family owned and operated.  Vietnamese news playing in the background and old Vietnamese dudes just hanging out for a meal; what's missing is their cigarettes!  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had fallen in Love with Phu Thanh unfortunately they moved to Peoria.  This place is basically the same, run by family.  Not too far from where the other placed was.  The food is fresh and inexpensive and very healthy too.  Please give this place a try, the Spring Rolls are perfect."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once a while ago but I didn't review and when I came back recently, I remembered why I didn't leave a review here.

Price is very generous. Menu price is lower than other Vietnamese restaurants in the neighborhood.

When I read a review here about tasting like a soap, I didn't get it until I went there for myself. It was spoon. They soak their soup spoon in detergent with bleach. I tried a couple of spoons but all had that aftertaste of bleach. I ended up using regular silver spoon to eat but bleach taste stayed in my tongue for a while.

Service is minimal, but they work hard and they are busy."}
{"text":"Service ranges from bad to acceptable, not great. Time for our food to be served is lengthy. They're definitely understaffed so it would take a while for food. Price is on point."}
{"text":"Because of an unfortunate incident, the other location was permanently closed. I don't know if this place is a reopened version or just happens to be another location chain. But it gets 5 stars for the delicious food and the cheap price!

The extra large bowl is $7. Seriously? That's cheap. The regular bowls are $5.50+. Usually, pho places are $8 or more so you can see why this is awesome. Plus, their broth is full of flavor. One thing you should try is the stew #7 because it is packed with meat. The pho that I get is packed with meat. None of this 3 pieces of meat crap from the other restaurants. I still had meat in my bowl at the end of the meal. The amounts are generous which is another reason for the 5 stars.

Appetizers are cheap too. Cheaper than a lot of places where they charge you like $5 for spring rolls. Here... $2. Yeah... 

I don't know about the service cuz I'm not really high maintenance but their service is ok. And the restaurant is medium clean. Oh well. I just came here for the awesome pho, anyway."}
{"text":"I got a vegetarian dish with noodles and veggies and it was delicious! Their Thai Iced Tea is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Was referred here by a friend and can't get enough. Everything is delicious, especially their broth and the staff is great."}
{"text":"I really really like their canh chua ca and their ca kho to. Definitely my go to place when I'm craving those dishes. This place is a lot better than many Vietnamese places I've tried. I've only togo'ed here, haven't tried eating in the restaurant yet."}
{"text":"Their Pho and bun bo hue are very flavorful! We haven't sat down to eat but when ordering to go, they do not disappoint and provide enough broth and veggies. If you like the traditional shrimp spring rolls,  you must venture out and try the shredded pork spring rolls (bi cuon).....you don't find these at many Vietnamese restaurants as I'll say this because this is the 2nd place I've found so far, as I've tried a lot of different Vietnamese restaurants!  Anyhow, it's amazingly delicious and won't disappoint."}
{"text":"One of the best pho restaurants I have been to in AZ. I live in Tempe and have found that the pho restaurants here seem to be mediocre but I am more than willing to drive to Mesa to enjoy fresh food that comes out super fast and for a cheap price! I come here every other week with my family and have always received super fast service. I always get the 2A and spring rolls and it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found this place. The pho broth here is very comparable to that of Pho Van or Pho Thanh located in Phoenix. As I live in Tempe, going down to Phoenix every time I crave Pho (which is often) can be kind of a drag.

But alas Pho Thuan Thanh comes and saves the day! The broth is rich and clear and packed with flavor, along with that a bowl of pho is only 5 bucks which is such a bargain compared to the prices of pho at Mekong. 
This place is now my go to pho place and I plan on becoming a regular customer :)"}
{"text":"The pho here was one of the better top 2 places for pho in this area. I really like the broth, not too salty either. The sprouts in the spring rolls were old and didn't taste to great."}
{"text":"I love this place I had big steak and rice service was excellent also very reasonable if you are on a budget ...even the water was very good I will be back thumbs up"}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in the United States. Extremely cheap in pricing but extremely large portions. We got a Pho and two separate entrees for two of us and ended up paying only $19+tip."}
{"text":"We have stopped going to this place. The quality of the food is terrible. The servers are rude! My bf and his friends saw a kid sitting behind the counter playing with the water that they serve you! Omg I am beyond disgusted. That's too bad since this place is next to our house and we used to go here all the time."}
{"text":"Don't let the location and building fool you. I come here once a week! Great price for authentic pho! I get the pho Ga (chicken pho) w/extra chicken, and the spring rolls! So good!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls with BBQ pork are better than DaVang's. Throw a little fish sauce in there and you're in heaven. Expect a bit of a wait though."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some good pho, this is your spot! My sister and I both ordered the 2A (beef pho) and it was delicious! 

We didn't try another else because we were so full after our pho but the entire menu looked very authentic and delicious. The employees were all very kind."}
{"text":"This review consists of around 8 visits. Recently as this place gets more and more popular, I've noticed the quality of the food going down. Also, the place seems dirtier than usual which is very deterring. The amounts of noodles they give you is probably the size of my fist, maybe a little more and the meat in the bo kho is around 2-3 pieces where there used to be 6-7. The broth is still very good and it's still decently priced, but things seem to be going downhill which is incredibly disappointing as this was a family favorite for a long time."}
{"text":"I was a regular at the old location on Southern and Extension and I was totally heart broken when I drove by and saw it was closed down. Then a friend of mine excitedly let me know that they opened at this new location!!! YAY! I went right away and it was spot on just like at the last location. LOVE the egg rolls, and they always include the mint :) Also had pho and it was tasty and perfect. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I'd give the food five stars. It was fresh and delicious. The chicken pho was great, as was the shrimp and noodle salad my husband ordered. I'd go back for the food. 

The place itself seemed dirty. There were boxes of stuff in the hallway, and the bathroom had spilt soap everywhere. It smelled a little funky; maybe because of all the organ meat they serve? 

Great food; messy restaurant."}
{"text":"I've known the owners my entire life and they're so sweet, caring, and humble people. The prices are sooooo cheap and the food is amazing. I come here all the time and I have no complaints. If you want good food for a great place, add this to your list of places to try!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here.  Read the Yelp reviews so I wanted to try it.  First of all, the service was horrible.  No one acknowledged us when we came in; the restaurant was not busy at that time.  After waiting for more than 5 minutes, we had to flag down a waiter for the menu.  After we ordered, I asked for spoons/forks for my children and the waiter told me it's behind me and told me to go get it myself.  I was shocked by that, but got up and got them for my kids.

We ordered \"Pho Dat Biet.\"  The price and portion was great, but the broth was tasteless.  I have tasted many phos in my lifetime, and never has had one so tasteless before.  We also had, \"Mi xao.  The mi was flavorful, but the vegetables were tasteless and there was not much meat/seafood in there at all (2 shrimps, 2 rings of calamari and about 4 imitation crab pieces).  I have never had one with so little meat before.  In addition, the \"Banh mi thit nguoi\" was the worst I've had - there was hardly much meat and there was too much pepper - not too flavorful at all.  Furthermore, the \"Com chien tom\" hardly had any shrimp in it, even though there was plenty of rice.

The chef must have forgotten to add spices to our food during this day, as my experience seems to be in the minority here. It is definitely not a place I would visit again - even though the price and portion is good, the service and food was awful."}
{"text":"Very good food at a fantastic value, I would highly recommend anyone looking for a bang for your buck stop in and enjoy a bowl of Pho and a plate of marinated pork rolls."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Vietnamese restaurant, like ever.  Everything tastes so authentic and the pho is always perfect and so flavorful.  Also their bun bo hue is delicious.  They are never cheap with the herbs that go with the meal, which I absolutely love for. Prices are wonderful and the staff feels like family! Also they have soda sua hot ga (egg custard soda) which half of the restaurants I've been to don't have.  They also have quite a few dishes that other places don't offer.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and very friendly customer service! I was surprised at how good the Vietnamese food was cause I'm spoiled by Southern California's great abundance,

I love the crepes, pho and broken rice dishes :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's my favorite Pho place in the Phoenix valley. The broth is great, the price is great. and portions sizes are very generous! I love the beef stew styled pho!"}
{"text":"Alway been a good place for some Vietnamese food cheap and fast service. But not counting some of the time that i had bad experience with the waster and some emergency  restroom explosion. But you get what you paid for. The pho is good here everything else think twice before i get it."}
{"text":"I like it, prices are cheap, but the quality is good. They give good portions for what you pay for and the pho soup is great. Me and my friends have been looking for a good play that is cheap and give good portions at the same time and only one other besides this is great, unfortunately that other store is close. We were skeptical when we entered, but after eating we like it. The only thing is that this place is closed every Tuesday and my friends and I usually meet up to eat and chat on that day."}
{"text":"We walked into this place, and was greeted with that authentic Vietnamese greeting - dead stare and no \"Hi\" We whispered \"this place is going to be gooooood\" LOL. We ordered a banh thit nuong, canh chua and ca kho = $27! Not bad.

Canh Chua: Was awesome. Flavor was on point! Just wish the veggies were chopped a little smaller, but that's not a deal breaker. Still at 5 stars here

Ca Kho: Was awesome too! The broth wasn't as thick as I'm used to, but the flavor again was on point! Perfectly paired with the Canh Chua. Still at 5 stars.

Banh Mi: Hmmm I picked up the Banh Mi and the whole side that was down was wet. Okay, weird but I could get pass it. First bite, was great. I believe that section had mainly meat and soy sauce. Second bite, not so much. I tasted something bitter and heavy, I figured it was the pate that i asked to be added. So I opened the sandwich to examine what was happening. The pate looked a little like the store bought ground liver $2 roll, which I would have been ok with it. I know a lot of places don't make their own pate. The next part is super offensive, which I confirmed with the staff - they don't use Vietnamese mayo. This is straight up American Mayo. Yuck!!! Not on a Vietnamese sandwich. No no no no! Never again will I order a banh mi here. You cannot serve american mayo with a banh mi, that is just lazy. It changes the whole flavor. I couldn't finish it. Thumbs down on this one. This could have been a really good sandwich had they used vietnamese mayo.

Because their other food was good, I will only deduct 1 star due to the banh mi. Everything else I ate was great. I will come back for their other food though."}
{"text":"This place is close to home. And I'm glad it is.

I can't speak to authenticity, or what part of Vietnam their cuisine reflects. But I can see execution in the hot runny egg in my bahn mi or the crispness in a crepe appetizer I don't think I've ever seen on a menu. They don't stint on the side greens and vegetables. And the usual condiments are on the table.

They have more than a few things I haven't seen on a menu. Like beef stew. Like this salted lemonade drink they have. I don't know how the lemons are prepared, but there's definitely some fermentation going on. Or maybe they just add some fish sauce. Sound weird to you? Well. It tastes great, and is really refreshing on a hot Arizona day.

So I have lots of reasons to go back.

There is nothing fancy about the place. It's more than a bit disorganized in a organized sort of way. It reminds me of a lot of places you might find in San Francisco.  Good food, cheap prices, and not for neat freaks or OCD's.
 
I find the people polite enough in a reserved way. They don't have the manic faux friendliness some people seem to expect in this metro area. I had a nice chat with the owner's husband after I asked him how to eat the crepe thingy. He joked about how messy I was going to get. And when I paid for my breakfast he pointed out more messy wrap things on the menu. More reasons to go back."}
{"text":"$5.25 for a huge bowl of pho! $2 for spring roll appetizers! The prices can't be beat here, nor can the huge portions. The menu carries a wide range of dishes, from soups, to rice plates, to banh mi sandwiches.

We started with the spring rolls. They were crispy, nicely fried, with a delectable mixture of veggies, ground pork, and shrimp. We each got a sizable portion of dipping sauce to go with the rolls, which I appreciated.

We also got the pho ga, and the #59 rice porridge (Mixed meats- squid, shrimp, fish meatball, pork, and imitation crab). The pho ga had a sizable portion of chicken and noodles, and came with a heaping platter of bean sprouts, greens, and limes on the side. The broth was very light tasting compared to other restaurants. The rice porridge was nicely seasoned, but also a \"lighter\" type of rice porridge, with more liquid and less rice than I usually see at similar restaurants. There were about 2 pieces each of shrimp and squid, a few pieces of imitation crab, and some scattered slices of pork in the mixture.

I also ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. It took a long time for all the coffee to drip down into the glass, but once it was ready, it was a thick potent concoction, strong, smooth, and sweet.

Service was very basic. Aside from taking the order and bringing out food and drinks, we didn't really have anyone check up on us. I had to grab my own straw from the packaging table, and grab my own to-go container to package up my leftover rice porridge. We paid for our bill at the cashier's table.

Overall, I enjoyed the food, and I'd definitely come here again to try more of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my family. The Vietnamese entrees are bomb. (Although I never had the Banh Mi here so I can't say if it's tasty or not). I never see a problem with their broken rice dishes (Com Tam), their Bun Bo Hue, or their Pho. And I've had my fair share of at least one dish from each section and they're great. My family loves it as well. Rest assured their chefs are actually Vietnamese! 

Customer service is alright, nothing stands out. The dishes are well portioned and amazing for the price. 

You must try to Canh Chua hot pot before you say anything negative, it's amazing! We've only had one issue where their dish was kinda funky, but they replaced it with another dish we ordered with no problem. 

This place is great, especially if it'll be your first time trying Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Okay. Holy crap. I didn't expect the food to taste so freaking amazing. Absolutely one of the best on this side of town. I highly recommend this place. Waited a bit long because I ordered to go but man was it worth the wait. Will order over the phone before coming in, but I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The only reason that I'm not giving this place five stars is because of the service. That's it- that's the only reason. It's not that they were rude at all- they were just your typical Asian restauranteurs:  indifferent, inscrutable, and inattentive. This is far from uncommon in many restaurants, so I can't really knock the points too much. But that, combined with the condition of the tables, was enough to knock a point off. Every table that wasn't occupied was dirty. Not filthy, mind you, but obviously they had only cleared the dishes from the previous occupants and not even wiped them down. Which, honestly, I could give less of a shit about, but I feel it necessary to point it out because I know that some people really get turned off by that.

Alright- all that being out of the way, let me talk about the food. The food was GREAT! They actually have shrimp paste on sugar cane, and it's honestly the best that I've ever had. The sugarcane itself is SO juicy, and the flavor of the shrimp is just insanely good. All of the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and I really enjoyed making my own 'wrap' with them. We both had the Number One pho, and it was delicious. The broth itself has an obviously beefy characteristic, and it shows that these people put some serious love into their stock. All of the meats were great- all of the ingredients were top-notch. This had tied for my favorite pho in Arizona, and it was everything that I was hoping for.

I'll be back. Many times, in fact. If they can show me that they keep a clean house, then I'll bump them up to five stars in no time."}
{"text":"I usually eat pho in Phoenix but in Mesa this would be the best pho restaurant. I usually order egg rolls and 1a (pho bowl with everything) egg rolls are always good. Pho is good , I think I've only had bad experience once out of 8 times. Service isn't great."}
{"text":"Decent vietnamese food and pricing is cheap. Pho is $6.50, specialty dishes like bun Bo hue an rieu rieu is $7.50, pretty cheap compare to other restaurants. The place is not much and service is well they take your order and bring your food, you'd have to flag them down from time to time for water refill. But you go for the food not the service. Banh xeo is filled and crispy at $4.50 a piece it's a steal, one of my fav. Chao long is good, canh chua and ca kho $15 bucks for the combo not bad. Again, decent tasting food but the cheap prices makes it worth it. I visit frequent often of get my fix and grab to go for the week. I'm vietnamese I grow up eating this stuff.. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I lived in SE Asia and the food here brings me back there. The prices are also great! The iced coffee and pho is amazing! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you are looking for five star atmosphere, don't go here.
If you are looking for the best Pho coast to coast, go here. 
I tried once and I loved it and I am going back again for some more. Talked with the owner and he is a chef for 25 plus years. Good food, reasonably priced, and good service with a smile."}
{"text":"Finally!  A pho place worthy of replacing Phu Thanh!  The service was okay (does anyone still expect good service from pho places?) but the food makes up for it.  The prices were reasonable (dare I say, cheap).  We went there strictly to try the pho, and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner around 7pm and got seated right away. The service is fast and we got our food quick. I ordered chicken pho and a longan drink. My boyfriend had their pork-chop rice plate. My pho broth was beef broth for my chicken pho .. which I usually like my chicken pho in chicken broth. I also noticed that their vegetarian pho was cooked in beef broth (stated in the menu), which defeats the whole purpose of vegetarian broth for those that don't eat meat. My drink was tasty and my boyfriend enjoyed his rice plate. This is probably a good go-to spot for a Vietnamese fix, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Good cheap food is always a great thing. This is my Sunday afternoon spot after a long Saturday night.  I usually get the Vietnamese beef stew with the side of French bread, I have yet to finish an entire bowl.. I have had to take it home they are so generous. Cheers."}
{"text":"This place is right by my apartment so I liked to come here. The service was always fast and the satff was always nice. Its the usual run of the mill pho', but I liked it since it was close and cheap. The spring rolls with the basil were very good. I never use the peanut sauce since i don't like the sweetness. I always eat these with the hot oil sauce or the siracha sauce."}
{"text":"I came there during lunch hour & the place is quiet busy for Sunday. I ordered egg rolls, crepe & spicy noodle soup. The crepe is about average & so do the egg rolls but the spicy noodle soup (bun Bo hue) is so bad with no flavor like water. It doesn't have beef & lemon grass flavor . I asked for fermented fish sauce (mam ruoc) but I didn't hear any response to my table. I wasted my money to order my soup & ended up leave it there to get to the counter for my meal payment. I don't want to stay there longer with my anger from the bad meal & bad service. Never go there again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Vietnamese food! Though it's not fancy on the outside OR on the inside, they serve pretty good authentic Vietnamese cuisine and it's pretty cheap too! 

Wow the pho bowl is HUGE here and it's like $7. I would recommend getting the pho thai or the pho ga. The both soup is really flavorful too! So good. When I'm not feeling pho, I also getting the rice plate with the grilled sweet pork of beef. I get the works too, I asked for an egg on top and also for that triangle egg thing. I'm not sure what it costs. 

My wife and her parents love getting bahn cuon! Think of it as meat wrapped around chewy rice paper. It's really good and the meat flavor is awesome! 

Tips:
Don't get seated next to the bathroom, lol for some reason that always grosses me out
Sometimes they don't have stuff in stock, so know a substitute that you'd be willing to get too"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are on the hunt for a go to pho place, this one comes in pretty close.  We got the eggrolls, pho tai, and pork chop rice.  All of which reminds us of the LA style vietnamese food we crave from home.  The only thing about this place is you can totally taste the MSG.. the pho is a bit salty but seriously you can fix it with just adding water to your taste.  The pork chop was so tender and egg rolls super tasty.  It is in a more sketchy area than others but as LA natives.. not phased much. I have yet to try the Pho Ga.  We did order this togo.. waiting to go try it at the resturant it self!"}
{"text":"There pho and bbq pork spring rolls are an absolute must! I would give it a perfect 5 if the service wasn't as bad at times."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting pho places around. I like to say the sketchier the better for good pho, which is definitely correct for this place. It is tucked in the corner of Broadway and Dobson and very easy to miss if you don't know where you are going. 

The service here is hit or miss as well as the food sometimes. But you can't expect that much from a lesst than $6 bowl of pho. Sometimes you get the ideal combination of meat and noodles in declious broth and sometimes one or more of those elements are off. The spring rolls are also really good if you can get over the grease. The rice plates are also a good deal with a good helping of meat and broken steam rice.

Overall its great for the price you pay."}
{"text":"NEGLECTFUL... one of the worst dining experience I have had. 

We came here by recommendation of a \"friend.\" Friend is in quotations because it was one of the worse dining experiences, and it was so bad that I wouldn't even recommend it to an enemy. I came with two Vietnamese people who were craving a particular dish that they wanted to introduce to me. My friend called ahead and said they had this particular dish, but when we arrived, they said they didn't have it because they were out of vinegar. 

Okay, So not big of a deal, they were out of vinegar, it can happen. So the server suggested like a grilled version that you grill at the table. We also ordered two bowls of pho with that.

After about ten minutes. The guy brought out the grill and the plate of uncooked meat and the rice paper skins and veggies. And... That was pretty much it for almost 20 minutes. We watched the other tables around us eat and leave and My friends were getting very annoyed and we were all pretty hungry. So I made one last attempt and personally walked up to the server and said we're missing the two pho, the grill is not on, and were missing a bowl of water to wet the rice paper. 

He came out with the water and we continued to wait for the pho. Once the pho came, it wasn't even that delicious or flavorful as I had at other pho places. My friends agreed. 

So, in summary, the food isn't worth the poor service and long wait."}
{"text":"As a pho fan, I have a pretty delicate criteria that balances flavor and price. Pho Thuan Thanh really strikes that balance for me.

My go-to order for my boyfriend and I is 2 orders of spring rolls and 2 bowls of pho! Really tasty broth!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese place on the East side. I've searched long and hard for a place with pho and banh mi. You would think it wouldn't be that difficult to find, but it was. I definitely favor them over the places in Mekong plaza. The pho broth is flavorful and the pork in the banh mi is delicious. And it is all very reasonably priced!  However, I've been here twice and they were out of sandwiches, which was quite a disappointment. 

The service is okay.... But I don't really care. I'm just there for the food!!"}
{"text":"Super cheap and super tasty. Long time pho eater. One of the the best Vietnamese joints ever. Very fast service. Bowl of pho $6 and pork chop dish for $5. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wife took me to eat here !! again . We got time to kill so we decide to dine in instead of taking to go ! As always pho is excellent and delicious!!! Need not to brag about it .Surprisingly waiters were pretty friendly than last time we were here . Well not too crowded tonight.. That's plus and I always has to use their restroom to wash my hands before I eat . Well very impressive! Keep the place pretty neat & clean . Last time I was here . I had to maneuver around restaurant supplies before can get to the restroom and trash can full of paper towels spilled out on the restroom floor. It was ruin my appetite!! But tonight it was good . You deserve a five stars seriously!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Located in an old small strip mall the ambiance is nothing to write home about but I'm here for the pho so it quickly fades when walking in and seeing the place full with a hungry belly.

I ordered up  the 1b (extra large pho with the gamut of meat, beef, tripe, tendon)and the bbq pork bun mi.

YES and YES, thank you!

The bowl was huge and the broth was hot with deep flavors you only get from a well maintained stock.   Of course it came with the usual suspects, basil, jalapeño and bean sprouts.  You also find plenty of noodles at the bottom.  I want to go back tomorrow and the next day and the next day.

The bun mi was exactly was I was craving...for 2.75 you get your money's worth and then some.   The bbq pork was marinated with perfect balance.  The sweetness and char is to die for.  

I'm glad I found a new spot to come to when I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Related to da vang n phu thanh,,,  since phu thanh moved to peoria,  this place is def the best on the east side.."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight.  Food was just ok for me.  Not quite the flavors that I like.  I have my favorite Pho place and tried this to see how I liked it.  We had duck soup,  Combo Pho, Crepe, #10, and bbq beef over rice. The place was busy with mostly Vietnamese people and our Vietnamese friends recommended it.  So we thought ithad to be good.  Like I said,  was just ok for me. I will stick with my go to Pho place."}
{"text":"Pho is pho.... Decent for Arizonan pho ! Can't compare to California's pho places though :("}
{"text":"Great pho! I had the beef. It was nothing but perfect! The Resturant was clean and service was awesome! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got a 4 star. I'm very picky when it comes to pho. Maybe that's the Viet in me or the fact that nothing compares to my mom's pho. 

This place has horrible service. Which is unfortunate since the food is pretty decent. It took us 20+ minutes just to get some water and menus. When we got our menus they wanted to take our orders right away, on the spot. Um can I look at my menu first? 

I ordered the rice with BBQ pork. So com suon nuong. Yummy. My family ordered pho. By the time they got their dishes I was already done with mine. My Thai tea had more ice in it than actual Thai tea. If it wasn't for my family I'd never come back here."}
{"text":"This place is very clean but a little hidden in the corner but what a jewel yet to be discovered.  My favourite Pho restaurant went back to Vietnam for vacation and this place have changed ownership so I gave it a try and what a surprise..The soup broth is superb which rivals their competitors and the service is extremely friendly.  I saw the presentation and I am very happy with it as well.  I've ordered Pho Xe Lu (extra large $7), Gui Cuon (Vietnamese Spring Roll), Condensed Coffee, Che (dessert) which are very delicious.  With a little more word of mouth, this place can be a East Valley giant if the words get out.  I will return soon."}
{"text":"I've been here at least half dozen times and can't believe I didn't write a review for them. This restaurant was opened by the same family as Da Vang in central Phoenix. As you can probably tell, the food and the menu is very similar to Da Vang. Everything is delicious and ingredients are fresh. The broth in the pho is amazing. 
The can do a slightly better job at cleaning the dining room though. I will continue to eat here; the food always bring me back."}
{"text":"\"Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.\"  ? Ludwig van Beethoven

3.5 stars easily.  Being that I feel like a walking ice cube 99.95% of the time, I decided that I needed a nice bowl of pho to warm up with.  I've been wanting to check this place so tada!  I popped in with the mister for a bite.

Portions are huge even without the extra-large upgrade and the flavor is decent.  I'm not Vietnamese but I can still appreciate the care that went into their broth.  Minus my Bun Bo Hue not having pork blood, I'm a happy camper!  It's not my favorite pho place by any means but at $18 for two entrees, an order of springs rolls, and an order of egg rolls, I'd still be back.  Phoenix pho place prices in the comfort of the east valley, huzzah!

Service is pretty non-existent and the servers like to walk around singing loudly to the music, much to my amusement.  It's okay though because all I really need is a water refill when the jalapenos starts burning a hole in my mouth.  This is just your typical \"Shut up, sit down, and eat your damn food!\" kinda place with no frills.  I dig."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places to eat; we're here at least once a week. Pho is my favorite, bun and spring rolls are delicious too. Not fancy, basic tables and chairs, etc. but we don't care, we're there for incredible food."}
{"text":"I came here to get some Pho Ga.  I have only had Pho a handful of times before this visit, and I wanted to get another taste before a trip to Vietnam.  One thing I really like about this restaurant is that the attention to customers seems to be important here.  Many Asian places don't seem to place a lot of interest on customer service, but I felt that we were well taken care of here.  I am seeing some of the reviews of bad customer service, but I had good one.  The taste was pretty good as I felt nice and warm afterwards."}
{"text":"I love the place. Its a family run business. The service is fast and the food is great! I bring my friends here."}
