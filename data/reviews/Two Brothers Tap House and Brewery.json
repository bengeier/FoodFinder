{"text":"We recently hosted a rehearsal dinner and meet and mingle at Two Brothers.   We searched the area for several months for a place for this special occasion.   Choosing Two Brothers turned out to be the best possible decision we could make.

We initially spoke with one of the managers.  He showed us the different spaces and provided us with information and sample menus.   We decided to reserve the upstairs area which is great for private parties.   It's really nice because it has an open view of the entire place while still being private.   One of the reasons we reserved Two Brothers is that they are so easy to work with, flexible, and willing to listen and customize the menu and entire experience based on what we want.

Over the holidays, we (my family) stopped in for lunch one day and we all ordered something different so we could try many of their dishes.   I noted our favorites... and we also walked around the space upstairs and discussed how we wanted everything set up.

I worked with another manager on all the details for the event.  I met with her in person and gave her my thoughts on how I wanted the tables arranged and also went over the timing, food menu, drink choices, and all the details on how I pictured our events.  This was actually like two consecutive events in one night.    She was such a pleasure to work with.   She took notes on everything I said, answered any questions I had, provided follow up choices on things such as desserts and then sent me a typed document showing all the details we discussed with detailed pricing information.   She was able to incorporate all of my ideas and choices exactly how I described them to her.  I was really impressed!   She even had custom menu's printed just for our event.  They looked great!  Her attention to detail was so impressive.

Our rehearsal dinner and meet and mingle event at Two Brothers exceeded every expectation I had!   Everything was perfect!   She made every single detail a reality.  Even the timing of serving appetizers, food, desserts was exactly how I wanted.   I did not need to remind her or the servers of anything.   They have a remote bar upstairs which was staffed for our event.   There were three bartenders/servers dedicated to our event.   They were absolutely amazing!  The manager I worked with had briefed them on everything so they knew exactly what to do and when.   They took such great care of our group!   They were professional, happy, caring, efficient individuals who provided our party with unparalleled service!   Two Brothers sure knows something about hiring good people because they were truly the best of the best.   I am typically pretty good about noticing things that are less than perfect and with so many details I thought it would be difficult or even impossible not to have several things in which I might be even slightly critical about.  Let me just say ... there was not one single thing!  They exceeded my expectations in every single area.

I received so many positive comments from guests we had at our event on how much they enjoyed the food, the service, and literally everything about the evening.  It was really such an amazing night that we will never forget.   What a great way to kick off the wedding weekend!

Oh... I forgot to mention... we love Two Brothers beer as well!   A couple of weeks before the event, my son and I stopped by and tasted a number of their beer selections.  We had a great time at our tasting and really enjoyed experiencing all the different flavors.  Our guests at our event really enjoyed the beer and wine as well.

Thanks to everyone at Two Brothers for making our event so amazing and memorable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the location!!!! They have a dog friendly patio, which is great and they give dogs a cute water bowl to drink from:). The food is good, standard, American food. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch, enjoyed an omelette with fruit salad. Omelette was well made, not greasy and you could pick as many toppings as you wanted for one price. Fruit salad was actually fruit...berries, kiwi, oranges, not just the standard melons you would expect. Mimosas were great and the service was spot on. The restaurant as a whole was not busy but it could have been the time of day. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Halle was great! Try the fish tacos and the cheese curds! Craft beers are definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"We got our apps before our drinks, 2 orders were incorrect, and the fish and chips resembled children's fish sticks. On the bright side, the beer was good. Maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Went last night with friends. It wasnt too crowded so we received our food and drinks extremely fast. Everything was good!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the phrase \"looks can be deceiving\" couldn't be any more relevant. Awesome building that obviously catches your eye from Scottsdale Rd. Ordered the Beer-garita and it was great. Waiter told us that the fish tacos were the staple of the company and are a huge hit in Chicago, so that is what I ordered. The only thing I could taste was thick breading and tortilla. It was a task trying to swallow each bite. Not to mention there wasn't an ounce of flavor, and same with my boyfriends bacon wrapped meatloaf. I had a bite of his peas because I was still hungry after eating only one taco, and the peas were crunchy and had so much pepper it was insane. Seriously, how do you fail at peas??? I've never bashed a restaurant before, but I feel too tricked and genuinely pissed to hold back. Oh, and be sure to ask exactly what accompanies the dish because I got a pound and a half of pico on each taco (I HATE raw tomatoes and onions) but it doesnt inform you in the description on the menu.  Two stars for the optical illusion the building creates."}
{"text":"*Lunch. Noon. Wednesday. Empty save a few people at the bar and patio.
*Nice build-out. Industrial. Open and airy. Seating outside if you want sun and traffic (it's right on Scottsdale Rd).
*Staff looks to have been bought on the cheap - shabby, frumpy compared to the Old Town Scottsdale run-of-the-mill pretty people. Service was friendly.
*Burger, fries, beer on draft. Burger ordered medium rare. Food came out 10-12 minutes after ordered.. Burger was medium-medium well. Sent back for medium rare, as ordered. Ranch watered down and tasted like tzatziki sauce. I had to ask if it was indeed ranch, and indeed it was. Beer was cool, not cold, and had to be sent back. Beer came back almost cold, 5 minutes later.

**Summary (and tips for the management): For a restaurant competing in Old Town Scottsdale, you better bring your A-game 100% of the time - ESPECIALLY so since you just opened your doors, and are charging $12 for a cheeseburger. In the age of Yelp you'd better come correct. I'm hoping that my experience was a witness to growing pains/learning curve and am currently undecided if I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my night at Two brothers. I was traveling out of town and did a brewery tour  and this one ranks second on my list. The beer was tasty, the atmosphere was fun and welcoming. There was great outdoor seating too but I choose to sit at the bar. The bartender wasn't as attentive as I would have hoped. Overall great experience. Also the brewery is in Downtown Scottsdale so there is a lot to walk around and see. After I was done I headed to Creamistry! Definitely try Outlaw, by far my favorite beer of the night."}
{"text":"Went with two friends for dinner and none of us were impressed with our meals. Overpriced salads that were very small. The only saving grace was the beer."}
{"text":"First time at Two Brothers Brewery today. The hostess sat us, very kind asked us if we'd like water. Literally sat for 15 minutes, no server came so we went to the bar and got a beer. The restaurant wasn't busy but we could see they were training a new server and being from the industry we understood. Sat with our beer for 45 minutes, not one server asked if we were ok or needed anything. Surprised at the lack of service when there were plenty of staff on hand. Won't be back needless to say."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese and mixed greens and strawberry salad were delicious. They have a great selection of their own brews and also support some of our local breweries. I love the brick, concrete and modern touches in the restaurant, and it is noticeably clean. Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"New place in Oldtown. Seems like they rushed to open. Food isn't anything special. I like how the place looks but I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Decided to move from IL to AZ and enter on Four Peaks turf. Well, this place can't even sniff four peaks jock. Four Peaks beer is better and the food can't even compare. The food hear is low grade dog food. This place won't last for another year before it bites the dust in a very competitive market."}
{"text":"Old Town needed a place like this! Great beers and keep coming back for the Cuban sandwich! The staff is knowledgable.  I recommend getting the $2 sample size of multiple beers. Great atmosphere.  The patio is perfect for people watching along Scottsdale Road and the inside has a great industrial feel. Will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent, we have been 3 saturdays in a row and always had friendly and attentive servers.

They have a great beer selection with different varieties other than the standard IPA, Pale, Stout that you see at many brewpubs. I like being able to try new spins and flavor profiles when a brewmaster is being creative.

The menu is good and we both thought they have the best pretzel we have ever had."}
{"text":"Great food- the tuna appetizer was amazing and Curtis was an awesome waiter!! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good selection of house beers! I got the Wobble IPA and loved it. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is a beer snob."}
{"text":"Great spot. Beer = 4.5; Non-Alcoholic Beverage = 5; Food = 4; Service = 4; 

It's brand new and some of the kinks are being worked out, but on whole I'm impressed. Nice people. Set up very well."}
{"text":"The beer is great, amazing wings, good service, and fun atmosphere! I love this place! Great addition to the scottsdale craft brewery scene!!"}
{"text":"Definitely had better, rarely have had worse.  Giving them the second star as it was in their second week of being open and the beer was decent.  Food was bad, like real bad.  Nachos were inedible as the tortilla chips were so hard it hurt your jaw to get through it.  Give the manager props, he did take them off the bill and explained that they have been having serious problems with them.  They are nachos....no risotto.  There are nearly 1000 restaurants in Phoenix that consistently cook tortilla chips, how is this a \"serious problem\".  The beef sandwich was pitched as a favorite of the Two Brothers owners from Chicago and to get the giardineira like the true Italian beef.  This was not an Italian Beef (see picture).  This was a poor man's french dip.  They didn't understand what it even meant to \"dip\" the beef in the juice and just served it with a side of traditional au jus.  Ordered the salt & pepper fries, received fries with the truffle oil but no parmesan.  So I didn't get to try the truffle & parmesan fries or the salt & pepper fries...just a bad combination of neither.  I asked the server where the recipes came from and he said they were originally from the corporate store back home but some new guy from Cordon Bleu was changing everything.  Not sure how that is working out for them...."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place. Beers did not disappoint however we sat at the bar and had ok service.  Had to run down a server to get a 2nd beer.  Menu looked good and concept was there, just not delivered well. Ordered morning burger medium.  Got well done burger with overcooked egg.  Bartender did get me a new egg right away with a runny yolk.  With so many choices to eat in this area, may come back for a beer and move on."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and this became our go-to hangout. Plenty of beer options, food choices, and TVs to watch the games on. 

The atmosphere was good as a sports bar. It has indoor and outdoor seating options. 

All in all...solid hangout."}
{"text":"Food is decent but they charge full price for ice tea refills which was not conveyed to me at the time I requested a refill. Had I known I was going to put an additional $2.50 for my tea refill, I would have declined."}
{"text":"Didn't like any of their brews and waited 45 mins to get the wrong order. Fries were good though. That's why 2 stars. Try any of the other local breweries for great beer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service was great! It was pretty busy when we came in but the waiter we had (Robbie) never acted rushed and always had the time to answer our questions about the menu! And our food was spectacular. I had the steak frites and my bf had the fish and chips, we also had the loaded cheese fries as an appetizer. All of the food turned out amazingly!"}
{"text":"Outstanding outdoor atmosphere around cozy fire. Food and drinks were high quality and reasonably priced. Pretzel with beer cheese and mustard are a must have. Had their special which was the best bbq brisket sandwich and truffle fries. Manager saw us drop our leftovers walking out and offered to replace. Very few places would have made such a generous offer which we graciously declined for them to be responsible for our clumsiness. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and brew!  Had a group of 4. Cuban sandwich with spicy slaw was tasty.  Bacon wrapped meatloaf was very good as well. Garlic fries were outstanding.  Great outdoor dining as well."}
{"text":"Very happy to see another option in Scottsdale for beer lovers. The build out is great and the quality and choices of beer is good. The food is only OK compared to what you can get in other area establishments and it is overpriced. Some on the staff are knowledgeable and friendly, especially one of the bartenders. The GM should work on his demeanor. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The servers were all really nice and accomodating. I was looking for a t shirt to bring home and couldn't find the right size and two of them were more than happy to sift through their stock in the back until they found it. The food was pretty good - the pulled pork was nothing super amazing, but it was still a good sandwich with excellent portion sizes. Though I didn't get a beer, my two friends did and they said it was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is odd.  We came in on a Saturday around 3:00 PM.  The place was almost empty...maybe around 6 at the bar and a few folks outside.  I sat there forever before the bartender even acknowledged me.  When he finally did, he acted as though he was doing me a favor rather than doing a job that he is getting paid to do.  Anyway, I ordered two beers... one for me and one for my bf.  They were ok.  The bf wanted something to eat but the bartender never came back.  By the time he did, we just got our bill and went elsewhere to eat.  Since this was my first and only visit to this place, I will be back to try it again.  Maybe they were just having a off day..."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the good weather and impressive food. 

There were about 3 or 4 different groups of people who all sat down at the same time we did. Our waiter did an amazing job of getting our order and everyone else's orders in and our drinks to us in a timely fashion. 

We started off with beer brezen and it was very tasty. The twenty-plus beer cheese sauce was so good I could have had a pint of it by itself. I also ordered the Wobble IPA which was decent. 

We were wanting a light lunch so we both got salads. I got the Tap House with chicken which was extremely good. My wife got the Roundhouse chopped salad which was out of this world. The blackened chicken with the chile-lime vinaigrette paired so well with the greens and quinoa. 

Judging by the appetizer and two salads we had as well as viewing what others around us ordered the food here is superb. I wasn't overly impressed with the beer but it's a great place to get some grub."}
{"text":"Great beer! It's nice to have more brewery's coming to the valley- they are my favorite. The waiter was very knowledgable on all the selections and the beer was tasty. I had the bbq pork sandwich and I wasn't a fan maybe their other food is better, but there isn't a great selection of food which caused a loss of a star for me. Perfect place for a couple of beers, but I'm not sure if I'll plan on a meal here."}
{"text":"The beer was decent  the food was ok but the overall feel from the staff was terrible. When we arrive the manager who created us seemed pissed we came in. The hostess was close to hostile. When the food arrived they did not give us plates and when we asked about something, the manager snapped at us. He seemed very angry or overwhelmed. The only reason I rated this with one star was because of our server Samantha as she was truly amazing. I cannot recommend this place. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, menu looked good but should have listened to YELP reviewers. I ordered a waffle BLT with salt n pepper fries. I'm not sure if I had a whole sandwich or pieces of a sandwich? The waffle was a croissant with a few slices of bacon and two types of cheese (I think). I guess the waffle comes from the pattern left on the croissant from using a waffle iron as a panini press. It and the fries were pretty greasy. Didn't really taste the salt and pepper on the fries. Oh well, lesson learned! 
Maybe it would have tasted better if I was able to have a few beers beforehand??!"}
{"text":"The good:  Staff was friendly and accommodating.  The beer was refreshing.  And the atmosphere was adequate.  The bad:  The food...not so grand for the price point.  The beergarita was too sweet with little tequila or beer taste.  The $5 soup, while tasty, was served in a thimble!  The grilled cheese panini, again tasty, was the size of a card deck!  So, if small, tasty, and overpriced are your thing; this place may be for you!"}
{"text":"Great dinner!! A group of us went for diner and the food was awesome!! What topped off the night is some of us ordered the truffle fries and a few didn't and regretted not getting them. The Manager heard this and before you know it brought out a large order of the truffle fries for everyone to share! Amazing, that just made our night with that type of customer service! Will be back for the great food and customer service!! Thank you for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, but  I will not be back.  Last night we stopped in for dinner.  I order the grilled chicken sandwich with a salad and my stomach has been nauseous since.  Everyone else thought the food was mediocre at best.  

Our server was less than friendly.  I don't think she smiled once.

The place was clean and I liked the vibe....but that's it unfortunately."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying the service has always been extraordinary. I've been here about six times. They remember me, my dog, what beer and food I like. 
Each time I visit something has improved aesthetically. The outside patio is great. 
The food that I have had is all vegetarian options and they all impressed me. The pizza, pretzels, nachos, fries, veggie burger, hummus, coleslaw have all been delicious. 
The beer is good two. I like wobble IPA. Happy hour is good with half price apps but would be GREAT with half price pints. That would really make this place become a \"local\" spot and officially put them on the map. I hope they succeed because there is a lot of completion in old town. 
Best of luck! Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last weekend. Disclaimer: I only had sips of my friends' beer and did not have my own but what I tried was pretty good and my friends seemed to enjoy it as well. 

When it came to the food I was a little underwhelmed. We started out with some chips and guac. I didn't think you could really go wrong with tortilla chips but it was like chewing on bubble gum. For an entree I had the grilled chicken sandwich which I didn't care for that much either, tasted a little burnt. 

The atmosphere was nice however and I had a good time with my friends. Jeanie our server was hilarious. I will try this place again because I know how new restaurants tend to get better after they work out the new restaurant kinks."}
{"text":"Great location and wonderful beer!

I stopped in here one Friday afternoon for a beer and wow!  I was blown away by the number (more than 10) of house-brewed craft beers and the taste. These two brothers know how to brew a beer!

The location is great, located near Old Town, and the bar/restaurant itself was modern, clean, and vibrant. They had a really nice patio with fire pits, that I could see packing up after dark. 

I only had a couple of appetizers, but the food was fast, fresh, and good. 

The beer though...come here for the beer!  They have their own IPA, German Style, American Ale, Amber, and many more. They even have a rotating season selection of their craft beers...served in a chilled glass. Wonderful. 

Go sample the beers (they will let you!) and hang out at this fun, beer-centric spot near Old Town."}
{"text":"Very good experience.  On a wonderful November evening, we enjoyed the Mediterranean sandwich with Parmesan truffle fries and chicken chopped salad out by the fire pit with a beer sampler.  The good was good.  Great service.  The beer was very good.  The atmosphere was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a solid 3.5 stars. Ordered the lemonade shandy they make and it was pretty good, however I have one huge gripe. The beer just wasn't cold, I don't know about everyone else, but rather enjoy a nice cold brew. Also ordered the cheese curds which were pretty good, though slightly too salty. The atmosphere is pretty awesome and I really like how the place is set up."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for an evening of alfresco dining around outdoor fireplaces. Great craft beer selection and average pricing, but attentive, friendly, and sincere servers. The seating is on Scottsdale Rd so we relaxed while watching all the action of nightlife in the center of Old Town."}
{"text":"My burger lacked flavor. Toppings seemed ok, bun was nice so it must have been the beef. No seasoning. No flavor. Blah.  My daughter had honey sesame wings and they were too spicy to eat. 

We were with friends who we haven't seen in 9 years. We had a lot of catching up to do. Unfortunately our waitress kept interrupting us. 

Our company was great! This restaurant not so much."}
{"text":"Ehhh it's ok. The beer I tried was warm and seemed like there wasn't enough carbonation. We also ordered a margarita pizza. Also ok. I think they have such a great location if they gave there recipes more though and also maybe trial and error it could be better. There is potential!"}
{"text":"Recently while in Scottsdale for Spring Training we had the pleasure of eating at Two Brothers 3 times in 4 days. One dinner which was fantastic. I want to focus on the two breakfasts we had there. Down the street from some very popular breakfast spots, this place was virtually empty. We decided to check it out and were so pleased we came back the next day. I had the 2 organic eggs breakfast with applewood smoked bacon potatoes and toast. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and they were served with not just grilled onions but caramelized onions. The presentation was beautiful, the service was excellent. Next time in Scottsdale, I'll be back. Also a craft beer fan, I loved the Stout."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. My now husband and I went there for dinner with our family right after we had gotten married. We reserved a room but ended up doubling the number of people we gave them originally. Even though it was VERY apparent on the waitresses faces that they were annoyed with our family 80% of the time, they were still mostly professional. Very expensive, food was amazing, and they have board games for you. Would probably only go back for a big occasion again, but would recommend for a splurge night. They dealt with our bullshit (we have a very outgoing family), and respected us."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. 1/2 price apps, and the nacho plate is great!!!!!!!!  Pretzels app is delicious too. Wide open atmosphere. I've come here for a couple work meetings with laptops and it's been easy. We've always had great service.  It's not always super packed either, since it's new, which is nice. Definitely think place is a gem!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from Wheaton, which is the next town over from warrenville, il (the original two brothers) so when this place opened he was so excited. Finally, after months we finally made our way over to the new brewery in old town Scottsdale. Big open floor plan, parking can be a little annoying though because they don't have their own parking lot. We parked across the street. 

We ordered a ceasar salad, Cuban sandwich, truffle fries and sonoran cole slaw. Everything tasted great the Cuban came out nice and toasty. Fries were hand cut but crisp. I drank the Scottsdale shandy made with their EPA while my boyfriend enjoyed the domain dupage draft.

We will definitely come back. We'll make sure to come earlier next time because happy hour is only from 3-6 so we barely missed it"}
{"text":"The beer was okay but nothing special and same with the food. The girl behind the bar didn't seem to know anything about beer. I live in CO so we have a high standard of people behind the bar knowing everything about the beer they are serving. Eventually the manager came by during his usual rounds and I got decent service, but I was over it at that point and wanted to go home. I probably wouldn't come here again. There are way too many other places in  Scottsdale that have awesome atmosphere, food,  service that overshadow this  place. I felt like it was a chain without the finesse and good food to hold it up."}
{"text":"Overall, my comments are about the beer...

The place is nice, the service was very good, and the staff is very friendly.

I am just not a fan of their beer.  And I tried most of them.  I do like stronger tasting beers, but what I found is that they have one of  the weakest tasting craft beer.  

But, if your preference is more toward the lighter side in flavor, this might be just fine.  For, its not my cup of tea, or beer..."}
{"text":"The beer flight was awesome! So many in house selections to try and they were all winners. We sat outside and the ambiance is great with the fire pits! Snacked on a pretzel and cheese and it was actually one of th best ones I've had! The service was great, all over awesome experience, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came here on an early Saturday evening. There weren't very many people so we were seated quickly and service was prompt and friendly.

I'll keep this short and sweet...

*Good beer selection - some brewed on sight, others from their brewery in Chicago. Good amount of IPAs which are my favorite. I ordered an Outlaw - it was alright but I prefer something more bitter.
*Had the Waffle BLT - it's one of their award winning sandwiches. Two types of cheeses, bacon, arugula, and tomato pressed in a waffle press. When I order a BLT, I expect a good amount of bacon...this one had two pieces. It was more or less a cheese sandwich, add bacon. I expected it to be great since it had beat out some of the other dishes from area restaurants...apparently those must have been reeeaaaallllly bad.
*Salt and pepper fries were good 
*Potato salad was good but has cumin in it. I hate cumin.
*Excellent coffee

Sandwiches and sides are a la carte - $11 for cheese sandwich add bacon and $3 for fries. Meh. Had I ordered something else my rating might be different. Unfortunately, chances are I won't return since I don't find myself in Scottsdale often, and there are many other places I want to try in Old Town. If I do return, it will be for a coffee or a beer at the bar."}
{"text":"Your AZ website does not include a GF MENU Nor is it clear whether your  GF BEER is even available on site. Why would I stop there?"}
{"text":"Cool place, good beer and service. Mushrooms and quesadilla were pretty good but I'd try other food next time. Parking is a challenge due to the old town location."}
{"text":"Overall a very nice experience.  Our server was very polite and attentive without being intrusive.  The atmosphere was nice and family friendly.  The games to play at the table was a definite plus.  The beer we tried was good.  The food. The pizza my daughter had was good portion and nice in flavor with the sausage tending to be a tad spicy. (Not a bad thing). The Cuban tasted fantastic. The Cuban was not a traditional one but it's definitely a reorderable item.  The burrito was nothing special but not a bad thing. The fries.  Especially the truffle fries.  They are a slice of pure heaven.  Amazing.  
We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Quick stop at TBTH&B for early dinner on our way to Phoenix Airport.  Both my wife and I ordered chicken wings.  Along with a salad for my wife and an order of cole slaw for me.  Wife wings were slightly better than average.  My Habanero wings were mediocre at best.  Very hot (which is my preference) but offered very little flavor.  In fairness, the Caesar Salad and Cole Slaw were sizable and tasty.

However, it took almost 30 minutes to get our food even though we sat down at the bar at just past 5:00pm.  Remarkably slow! .  If it weren't for the great service from our bartender (Mickey) this meal would have been a real disappointment.  We won't hurry back....."}
{"text":"If you like brewery's, this place is a must!

This gigantic two story bar is perfect for lunch with the whole family, a casual dinner date, or a late night on the town with some friends. They also have an awesome patio that mirrors Scottsdale road which makes for some great people watching. Their food is great, and their beers that they brew themselves are amazing. It's located within walking distant of all the other bars in Old Town, which makes it ideal for a Saturday night randevú spot. But it always boils down to their great service, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent food, nice atmosphere. Large list of beers of course. We had a great waitress. Overall good vibes and experience"}
{"text":"We are from the Chicago area, where this beer was born. We were so excited to see a location here in Scottsdale. The beer was great as always and we had a great server. We did feel that our portion sizes could've been bigger (mac n cheese and stuffed poblano pepper), but the food was great. The outdoor area was very nice too."}
{"text":"Really great food, Fantastic beer and friendly staff, all around a great experience!

Tried several beers so far, a few different entries and appetizers. Quality is awesome, consistency has been great as well with multiple visits."}
{"text":"So pleased they took over this building. It's a great idea and the aesthetic is excellent!

 The beer was good although I didn't think the selection varied much. The food was really good and well presented. The staff was very hit and miss. A few were engaged and excited about the place, but most were not. Both types were very transparent! Overall, we were very happy. 

I noticed they had breakfast and were also a coffee roaster.Hmm... I was anxious to check that out and returned for coffee the next morning. Bottom line- It's a good idea, but skip the breakfast and go for beer and food. The coffee tasted like hot water, the service in the morning was terrible. 2.00, and 2 sips of 'coffee' later, I dumped it in a planter and took off looking for a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"The beer tasted great! Having lived in brew city, I have tasted a huge number of beers throughout the years and have a good palate for describing the styles. Two bros in on mark. The food menu items are safe and simple. Their support Green action is a plus with me. Will return."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, good engineering. The tanks and brewing area are above the bar on the mezzanine level! You have to check it out.

Two Brothers had a good selection of beers, some brewed at their home brewery (I think in Chicago?) and some brewed in Phoenix. Most of the pints were $5 and they had some smaller samplers could try too. Our group tried several of the beers and loved all of them.

The food far exceeds your standard brewpub fare. The pretzels were some of the best pretzels I've ever had and the beer cheese was awesome. The cheese curds were lightly battered and fried, and the horseradish sauce gave it a nice kick.

I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the food menu and more beers. I heard the fish tacos are really good and want to try those."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My boyfriend, roommate and I stumbled upon this on a very busy Saturday. Our original plan fell through with another restaurant who had a 1+ hour wait and the patio outside Two Brothers was too inviting to pass up! We started with the cheese curds which could rival ones that I had fresh in Wisconsin. The Beertini was much stronger than you would assume and so tasty I think I finished it within 10 minutes...  I followed it with the dark flight (my favorite being the Northwind) and the glasses were very generous for their cost. (Ended up sharing with the guys) The shortrib sandwich was moist, delicious and the bread was amazing! The three of us could not stop raving and we all sampled each other's order. The truffle fries were perfectly seasoned and an portion large enough to fill you up! After getting drunk, we finished up with getting iced mocha's to go and explore the neighboring stores which also was great! Not too sweet or heavy and the roast on the coffee was perfect. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I would love to have tasted the food but my wife and I sat for 20 minutes without any server asking us what we wanted to drink much less what we wanted to eat.  It was disappointing because we had good service in January when we were last there.  We walked out and no one seemed to notice."}
{"text":"Two Brothers Artisan Brewing takes Scottsdale to Chicago.  It shows the sleepy town how to make a quality craft beer, how to prepare a proper cheeseburger, and, most importantly, why pigs gladly give their lives to become pulled pork sandwiches.  Enjoyed to the nth degree.  Thanks Two Brothers and chef Tommy Michel for putting heart into Arizona."}
{"text":"This place can pretty much be summed up for their general dumbness and cockiness. They run a brewery and tap house and everything is based on beer, but yet at Happy Hour they do not offer any discounts on beverages, just half price on greasy appetizers. They are cocky because since they own a few places in Chicago already, they think they can swoop in and all of Scottsdale will follow like the pied piper. Chains fail here too and personally I'm fed up with the Chicagoization of the valley. Take your Windy City dogs and beef and lousy beers back to your cold and vanilla land of the midwest. I tried several beers and they really lacked the depth and taste of other breweries. Once all the midwest folks leave, here is hoping that Tap Brothers heads back home where they belong."}
{"text":"So the layout of this place is pretty nice and I saw some giant dogs on the patio which makes me super happy!  I came here with my son (he's 9) and they had a decent selection on the kids menu but he opted for the adults.  Our server was Rachel and she was great, and so was the girl following her

We ordered for appetizers a Greek salad and calamari.  My son loved the calamari, it was just standard to me, nothing to fancy.  And then I got a  Greek salad and it was probably my favorite thing I ate there.  They actually grill the cherry tomatoes and it makes such a difference!

For entrees we had a small pizza and the turkey chimi, as a recommendation from our server.  The turkey chimi was delicious! The pizza was kind of boring.  

Overall it was a nice experience, next time I'm in town I'll probably sit on the patio with my pup!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a spot outside for a beer with my mom - while it had good ambiance, we were disappointed all around. We did beer flights and after waiting a long time for their arrival, they were not good. 

Of 8, we only liked one (for context, I just came from 2 San Diego breweries where I loved all the flights I tried) - our server also placed all the beers right on the fire pit saying they were probably going to get hot sitting there next to the fire...gross, don't set them there then!

All in all, just not for me!"}
{"text":"During my short visit in Phoenix I wanted to visit as many breweries as possible and Two Brothers wasn't too far from where I was staying.  We stopped in about an hour before they closed.  The space is huge! Two floors and very open full of tables for dining.  

I was pretty impressed with the number of beers they had.  I went with an IPA, wasn't terrible impressed with it.  It was hard put my finger on it, or tastebuds why I didn't like it. The beer tasted kind of skunky, and there could be other factors for it tasting like that.  

My favorite part was the area of different board games including Nebraskanopoly (Monopoly but Nebraska focused?).  I schooled all of my friends in Connect Four and we still enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Great decor and vibe. Wide selection of taste craft beer and delicious fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Great beer! Really good food! The service is nice and the building is an amazing old red brick. I've had the southwestern Frittata, the Red Quinoa Salad and they were fantastic. The sandwiches are really good too."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection including awesome in house brew. Been here a few times. Well placed game screens, indoor outdoor comfortable seating. Easy to have a good time. Service consistently outstanding. Does have a Chicago feel to the food, lots of great options. I'm no expert but seems like business isn't flowing like it should. My guess is the price point for a brewery. I might throw in a couple of specials."}
{"text":"Date night with the pretty lady  the Cuban is legitimately the best sandwhich I've ever had.. go get it.. from the bun to the garlic mayo!!! Wowowowooww. If you like local breweries I'd definitely recommend giving it a try. It's delicious I'm telling you.. I can't explain how good that sandwhich is.. just go and buy it you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Originally met friends at 830 breakfast club across street. It was loud, crowded and a long wait.  Friends and I wanted to visit and not filled rushed.  We had been to Two Brothers for dinner and drinks and noticed they were open.  We walked across the street and boy are we glad we did.  They have a coffee house and breakfast menu.  I got a memosa with my meal for an additional 2.00 and friends Bloody Mary what a deal.    

Food was great, I got the 2 egg and my applewood bacon was thick and crispy, hash browns skinny and perfectly seasoned, friend got pancakes with berries and other fruit, she really like it, plate was clean and other eggs Benedict with avacado and sauce on side she was the healthy one.  

We enjoyed our meals and the fact we were not rushed through our meal.  Had we gone to the other place we would not have enjoyed or meals or each other's company.    Two brothers is large and not crowded and full at was open and had a few patrons around their large bar.  It was great to have good food, low noice so we could chat and nice music in background.  When we were leaving lunch crowd were arriving.   They have seating low and high tops inside and on a very nice patio with comfy seating.    Dog friendly patio

We will be back for breakfast again.  Who knew they were open for breakfast"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer while biking around the town. Service was bice and friendly and the patio was big and clean. Nice spot for a drink and a app. Their menu looked good too"}
{"text":"Nice, polite service.  My husband ordered fish n chips. Don't order the fish and chips.  It appeared to have been RE-deep fried, old fish and refried French fries.  Very heavy on the grease and soggy. I ordered a burrito, seemed tasteless without the green side salsa.  The beef inside was tough and gristly. No one else in our part complained about their food so maybe it was just us.  We didn't complain - just ate it but it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying it was GREAT to have a gluten  free (technically gluten removed) beer on tap. However the food, service and cleanliness lacked in a major way. I would only go back for a cold beer and that is unlikely."}
{"text":"Granted it was Saturday night during spring training, but music was way too loud even outside. Beer was good, server was sweet and attentive.  Food was so so. Chicken shawarma was bland and tasteless, needed a kick. Next time will get burger and fries."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food and decor. Tuna tostada appetizer and burgers were awesome. Nice seasoning on the fries. We tried a couple of the craft beers and they were all very flavorful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. After sitting at our table for 10 minutes and then asking if we even have a server, someone finally attended to us. We ordered drinks and an appetizer right away... The appetizers did not arrive until over 30 minutes from when we first arrived. The manager was the one to deliver them and seemed annoyed that I wasted his time expressing my concern with how slow the food and service was. I'm too annoyed to type out the full details of our visit so I will put it in point form.

- Nothing was cleared from our table from start to finish, including empty plates, glasses and even our menus

- They double charged me for my salad when the first one came out with meat. (In my servers defense, the meat thing was my error. I expected a traditional Greek salad which does not come with meat and I did not closely read the menu)

- They should stick with tradition on some things... My Greek salad tasted nothing like a Greek salad. It didn't even have a vinegarette  dressing or come with olives!

- Not sure if our server was given too many tables to manage or if he was just slow, but the service was unbelievably slow.

- Food was good, but took forever.

- Side sauce for our fries arrived 20 minutes after we ordered it. The fries were cold and soggy at that point.

I'm not sure where or why our dining experience fell apart, but every aspect of it was disappointing with the exception of our server being friendly. He was very nice and apologetic... I just wish the apology could have been delivered with better service.

Upon realizing I was double charged for my salad after paying the bill, I was too annoyed to wait another 20-30 minutes to have it adjusted so I left. The place is rarely busy and now I know why. 

I will never return."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick Saturday night dinner. The beers are Chicago based and some are made on site. I had the breakfast burger which was on point. The pizza also turned out nicely. Not the fanciest meal we had, but it got the job done. Also a great place to watch a game with outdoor seating out front and fire pits."}
{"text":"I went to two Brothers last night and got the chicken sandwich and a beer. You know two Brothers has been in business long enough and in the restaurant industry long enough that they should know how to make a chicken sandwich. They also should know when they have an awful chicken sandwich. It was one of the worst if not the worst chicken sandwich I have ever had. I probably would've stuck around and had another beer but the food was so bad that we moved on. I can go to any fast food restaurant and get a significantly better chicken sandwich and french fries. I didn't say anything to the manager because I didn't want my money back I wanted beer and something good to eat. The service and atmosphere deserved a 4-5 stars. If I return it'll only be for beer no food."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. We sat outside on a beautiful Saturday. The staff was welcoming and nice to us. They explained the beers they carry and the food menu. Both were awesome. They are top notch. The Classic Burgers were big and well prepared. Great flavor and large portions. Their beer was very good. I would recommend them to everyone. Great location in Old Town."}
{"text":"I have to give this brewery/restaurant 4 stars in that it was a Saturday night and Spring Training has begun. Our waitress Melissa brought us tasters before making a decision on what beer we wanted. 

Professional, courteous and fun 

I had the Cuban sandwich which was very good. 

Atmosphere was loud but testable for a Saturday night. 

This will be a great brewery when they start brewing upstairs. Overall, we had a good time with good craft beers"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the previous review about Two Brothers Restaurant Week menu before we went tonight. 

We love RW & liked the idea of getting beer tastings with each course, so that is why we chose Two Brothers. Like the previous reviewer indicated the courses were disjointed & they were subbing ingredients, so the dishes weren't as described on the menu. My skirt steak was so tough / chewy it felt like the cook had never prepared that cut of meat before. 

Additionally, even though the place wasn't busy & there appeared to be plenty of servers, our server was hard to locate & then seemed frazzled when she came to our table. I am disappointed because items on their regular menu sounded good, but we likely won't go back with so many other brew pubs in the valley that we enjoy consistently."}
{"text":"Great service. Best burgers--juicy, fresh and coked exactly to order. Delicious with and with the bun. Great beer selection and we look forward to their on-site brews once that's up and running. Everything we've had to eat here has been delicious."}
{"text":"nice patio. the food looks great but came here just try the drinks. tried the white Stout. so far really good. smooth with a hint of chocolate.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place and awesome environment. Went here randomly on New Years Eve for dinner. Josh was our server and was great! He has the bartender make me a surprise drink, which was awesome. And please for the love of god try the cheese curds for an appetizer. You're welcome in advance."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken sandwich is great.  fresh and good quality ingredients.  I moved to the area and they sent me a free entree voucher which is great for the community and I will be back because of this.  Only reason it's a 4 star is b/c a whiskey on the rocks was $9. It's a bit pricy."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I absolutely would. This was some of the worst food I have ever had. Service was good, vibe was good, even had a cool fireplace, but even the guacamole was bad. If you can't make good guacamole I don't know what you're doing in that kitchen. Nothing had salt NOT EVEN the French fries. I have had better french fries at McDonalds. Don't even get me started on the cheese curds. I seriously can not even get them out of my mind. The cheese was not melted and tasted funky. Once again one of the worst meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks and we had to ask someone to take our order for food. The food was mediocre at best. We shared a Caesar salad and sausage pizza. The pizza reminded me of cheap bowling alley or arcade pizza. Our friends shared the nachos... and by nachos I mean running cheese and soggy chips. The two stars is for the decent beer but we won't be going back. There are way too many good restaurants in the area to waste our time and money on this place."}
{"text":"Despite a number of visits to this brewery, I was hesitant to write a review due to widely varying experiences with service. I suppose I was hoping I'd encounter some consistency, but my most recent visit has soured me on the establishment as a whole. 

Last Saturday I sat at the bar, ordered a $5 beer. After waiting over 15 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge me or my empty glass, I decided ordering another was more trouble than it was worth, and set my credit card on my glass to indicate my intent to close my tab should the bartender bother to attend her bar. Eventually another employee walked by, took my card, and delivered my bill. I was charged $75.56. 

I spoke with the employee who charged my card and explained the situation. He told me he was the manager, reversed the charge, and kindly comped my singular $5 beer. I asked for a receipt of the reversal, he said he couldn't give me one, but that the pending authorization would be released the following morning, Sunday, and provided his name. 

So now it's Wednesday and the charge is still pending in my bank account. I called Two Brothers yesterday, spoke to a different manager who said he'd call me back after investigating, conceding that the charge should have disappeared by that time. He never did call me back, still have a pending charge for $75.56."}
{"text":"Manager was a huge dbag not only to us but to the staff. The place is a cool concept and we need something like that around here but it's going to close soon if they don't get that guy outta there."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a new place, and in the case of Two Brothers, I'm really glad we did!! A few friends recommended we give it a shot, as they'd been there to try it recently and the food was supposedly really good... So, Super Bowl weekend when everything was swamped, we found a little refuge in this cool, new spot!

The location is great, on North Scottsdale across from Bungalow, and the building itself is very nice. It has a clean but industrial feel, as most breweries do, with awesome skylights that make the place feel fresh and bright. Seating extends up to the second floor, though we sat on the first, and there appear to be plans to put in some large fermentation vats up there, which will be cool.

The menu looked incredible and I wanted to try everything! To start, we shared some smoked salmon and the pretzels. The salmon was okay - not as much my thing, and there wasn't a whole lot of pita/veggies for the amount of dip you get. The pretzels were great, though, and I'd definitely get them again!! I had a hefeweizen that was great and had a strong banana/vanilla flavor.

For my main meal, I was struggling between the fish tacos or the chicken sandwhich, both of which sounded amazing. The waitress was helpful and recommended the fish tacos... I think they sat in front of me a solid 30 seconds before I inhaled them! They were great!!! The batter was light, and everything tasted fresh. The quinoa I got with it wasn't great. I guess I was expecting it to be hot, and when it was cold with a very seedy texture, I left most of that on my plate. I'd probably try the parm fries next time, as the waitress said that those are a big hit.

After we ate, we hung out for a while and I decided to try one of the beer cocktails. It was gin and an IPA, and boy, could those get me into trouble!! I'm not normally an IPA fan, but the hops with the gin made for a great combination! Definitely not something I would've thought to combine on my own, but I loved it!!!

Give this place a shot - I really hope it sticks around!"}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews, girl at the bar has no
Customer service skills. 

I ended up walking out! They should make a rule not to have employees on their phones while at work."}
{"text":"So most brew pubs either have good beer or good food. In this case it came up short in both. Beer decent but wouldn't go back for it. Food was mediocre. Best thing was a fried chicken between biscuit (pictured). The falafel was awful. And the skirt steak was confusing. Dishes had disjoined ingredients and components that didn't work well together and was just like the service, slow and disconnected. In fairness it was probably because it was restaurant week and different service for them with pairings.
Looking around the place there was also a coffee shop and they are trying marketing campaign with dogs and the beer and dining, etc. I feel like they suffer from shiny objects syndrome and they would be better off just doing a couple of those things really well."}
{"text":"The physical location is quite nice. Decent patio and very open, industrial style inside. Service was friendly and prompt. We were there at happy hour. 1/2 price appetizers and a couple of dollars off beer and drinks. We only had the deep fried cheese curds, but they were delicious. They have a number of beers on tap, some brewed on-site and some at their home brewery in Chicago. I was not overly impressed with the beer. 2 of our party were not beer drinkers, but they enjoyed their beer cocktails. I thought they tasted terrible. I tried the Imperial Cain and Ebel, a red, it was good but at 7 1/2 abv should not have come in 10oz snifter. My wife tried the Wobble IPA, which was a decent IPA. I also tried their stout. Again, decent but kind of meh. Overall a nice stop, but beer selection pretty average this day."}
{"text":"Here for grand opening. Severely understaffed. Only two bartenders working. I realize opening night will have some rough spots, but seriously? Only two bartenders? $2 beers are great. I'd love to try one. 15 minutes to get a beer & still waiting. Not a good first impression :( Will try back in a few weeks. The free food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great service and great beer! We got a flight of some of the beers and enjoyed all of them! Would highly recommend coming here if you're visiting"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before, with good experiences, but last Sunday was AWFUL!!! The hostess seemed very under-trained, then our server was late greeting us and blamed the hostess. She never brought our waters, food arrival was out of order and sub-par (chips on the nachos were so stale they were unchewable).....and my hubby's Bloody Mary took foreeeeever and was watery. We brought friends here from out of town, and was very, very let down!!! Won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday around 3pm. We were sat immediately as the place was not very busy. Then no one came to our table. Two servers walked by our table at least four times, so it's not like we were hiding in a corner invisible to the world. We overheard a woman at another table complain about waiting forever to place her drink order. After hearing that we set a one minute timer and agreed to leave if we didn't receive service before then. We sat for a total of 10 minutes and then we left. Super bummed about this because the beer and the food looked great. 

Not sure what their deal was, but they definitely dropped the ball on this one. I said something to the hostess when we left, so hopefully the feedback makes its way back to management."}
{"text":"I've been to almost every brewery in Arizona and Two Brothers left me feeling unimpressed. The layout is great with an awesome patio, upstairs loft and even a private dining area for parties. However, it never seems to fill up and the environment feels stale and cold. They have quite a selection of beer, but most were too malty for my style. I did enjoy the guacamole plate and fish tacos for food! The parking is not very convenient and the area is always congested. I'd go with a different local brewery if you have the option."}
{"text":"Tried this establishment out 6/20. Great place. Great Service. Really good food and drinks. If you are on the fence give them a try. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and his family while we were staying in Scottsdale for the Fiesta Bowl. My boyfriend's dad is from the Chicago area, so we thought he would enjoy it. We also joke that he eats a cheeseburger a day (ok, it's not really a joke, it's true), and this place fit that bill. We each ordered a different beer, and everyone loved the beer they chose. We started off with the Chimichurri nachos with beef. The portions were HUGE and I definitely spoiled my dinner on the nachos because they were so good that I couldn't stop eating them. Everyone but me ordered the Frizzle Dizzle burger, and they all enjoyed that. I had the muffaletta sandwich, which was really good but so large that I couldn't finish it. I also got it with a house salad, and it was much better than a standard house salad. It had feta cheese and green olives in it and was very fresh. Everyone else had fries, which they greatly enjoyed. My boyfriend's father is handicapped, and the place seemed very handicapped friendly, but we also went a bit early so it wasn't too crowded. The staff was nice and we were served quickly. If I lived there I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer!  Dog friendly patio...even a dog bed and a water bowl. Robbie wasn't only an awesome bartender but very easy on the eyes with an adorable personality...alley gives him .  
The IPA'S were all smooth and tasty with a high alcohol content.  Nice job two brothers brewer.  Comfortable tap room with very affordable prices."}
{"text":"If you've read any of my spring training ballpark reviews, you already know I'm a die hard Cubs fan. And if you paid any attention to all the other reviews, you probably also know that I enjoy good beer. Put the two together and you've got a post season visit to Two Brothers Tap House and Brewery in Scottsdale.

One of my co-workers suggested we find a nearby bar with Chicago connections to watch the World Series. We decided on Two Brothers which is more than just a bar. They brew about half of the beers on the menu on site. The other locations in Illinois apparently brew the rest. I sampled five of the beers, the first four via a flight and the last in a pint.

There is something distinctive about the choices. Some of the varieties are not your usual beer styles. For example, they offer a French Country Ale named Domaine Dupage, which is a dark shade of caramel and incredibly smooth. In fact, with the exception of the Weisscracker (a tart, lemon unfiltered beer) all the beers I sampled were smooth. My final selection was a pint of Outlaw IPA which offered a new take on my favorite style. It's got that juniper aroma but the IBU's are kept in check by the smooth character. It's good!

I wish I could also rave about the menu, but we filled up on appetizers. The entrees must be amazing because the Beer Battered Cheese Curds and the Chimichurri Nachos (we added beef) were excellent! I was seriously full after sharing the huge portion of nachos. And thus, disappointed that I couldn't sample some coffee with desert.

This place has great atmosphere! And there was at least one television showing the Blackhawks game. Any Midwest transplant or visitor would feel right at home. Because I didn't get to fully experience the menu, Two Brothers is on my list for a return visit. Go Cubbies!"}
{"text":"Came here with my dad and sister visiting from LA and we were all really impressed! The food was amazing (I recommend the fish tacos) and my dad and sister split a flight of beer which was a great deal. The service was spot on and the ambience was great. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"We have tried this place on four different occasions each hoping it would get better however we remain disappointed and will not return.  Old town is known for great restaurants and food. Recently microbreweries and tap houses are opening which in my opinion is long overdue.  

They have a great location and the patio is awesome for relaxing and people watching. Decent beers, which alone would yield 3 to 4 starts. 

Unfortunately this is where the positives end. The food and service are horrible at best. The ribs maybe the absolute worst I have eaten in my life.  The Cuban was just as bad and awful excuse of a sandwich. The remaining items ordered where absolutely unmemorable. 

I honestly cannot condemn the food enough to do it justice. We have far too many options for good to great food in old town for this place to survive.  They need to seriously revamp the menu and learn how to make some decent food. I guarantee locals will not support inferior food no matter how good the beer or location.  If they do survive it will be due to the seasonal tourist and winter snowbirds not the locals."}
{"text":"Good place to check out if you're in Scottsdale. They have a nice selection of craft brew and the food is pretty solid!"}
{"text":"I am torn on how many stars they really deserve.  The food is delicious, and their craft beer is great, but the service is awful.  I have been in a number of times, and each time I am forced to wait no less than 20 minutes to be addressed to order.  I have sat at tables and at the bar, and the service is the same.  It disappoints me that a place that has the basis of food and drinks going for them can't figure out how to serve the customers in a timely manner.  

If you are not in a hurry, and want a good atmosphere, I definitely recommend this place.  If you are on a schedule, I would pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that there needs to be 1/2 star rating increments if possible. But \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" pretty much sums it up. Now, on with the review...

The great: The beer. I had the Domain Dupage which was lovely, amber, crisp and delicious. I was really happy with it. My husband had the Cougar Ale which he described as a \"Budweiser with good flavor\". He's not really great with words. The Back Home Burger that I ordered was spot on. Blackberry steak sauce, blue cheese and fried onions on a perfect medium beef patty that was hot and juicy and inside a delicious brioche bun. The salt and pepper fries were great, and just in case you aren't truffle-parmesan fried to death yet, they offer those too.

The good: The chorizo queso dip was tasty, if lacking in any real cheese flavor. The chorizo was nice. A little spicy, but not \"burn your mouth\" hot. The chorizo clumped together so we had to break it up, but still, nice and tasty.

The WTF moment: The ribs. Holy God, please send the chef a vision of how to properly cook ribs, or at least remind him that ketchup is not a rib sauce. From texture to temperature to taste, these were the worst ribs we've ever had. Super tough and rubbery to chew, cold in the middle with just the most god-awful sauce on them. My husband ate a few just to keep from being hungry, but it was pretty bad.  Don't order them!

The service:  Very sweet and non-intrusive without being slow or having to wait an absurd amount of time for anything. Our waitress had a good amount of personal knowledge about the beer and the food and was honest when she hadn't tried something. Always appreciated. She earned her tip.

Verdict:  Beer is top notch and they obviously take pride in it. Burgers appear to be their specialty, or at least what they know well, and are definitely worth it. Skip. The. Ribs."}
{"text":"This place had less than adequate food, service, and I guess materials. Everything we asked for including beer, napkins, and certain foods, they were out of; on a Saturday how is that possible? All in all a strong 2 star experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service, Special thanks to Megan our server. Had a great time and thanks for the extra coaster!!!"}
{"text":"Place sucked !!!!!!!  Service was bad , burger should not have been on the menu because it was what the advertised . The French fries were good , the beer was warm and the service sucked . Carl's Jr would have been a step up from this place . They had them on the news for father's day , I wonder how much they paid for the spot . Never will eat here again . I travel and eat out alot for work so I know what is good and what's not ."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. This was the most unpleasant and boring dining experience I've had in a long time. Very unorganized, food was just plain bland, beer was nothing exciting. Natural light would have been an upgrade. It is clear the owners have never ran s restaurant before and should not because that are not good at it. I look at it is it cost me $40 to never go back again. I wish I had the hour back of my life I spent to dine there. I predict this establishment to be closed in the next two months!"}
{"text":"_Good hefeweisen, amazing architecture"}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked to visit and brought my bff from out of town on Friday. Loved the ambiance, the food was really good but a little more ventilation might be in order. There was an overwhelming scent to the place that I assume is connected to the Brewing. My bff had the Reuben and loved it. I had the Sriracha honey chicken & biscuits which were good; a nice blend of spicy/sweet/savory but the sauce kind of soaked through the biscuits making them fall apart. I'd definitely be back for the beer! We loved the Ebel's Weiss! It takes me back to my days of living in Germany."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect here. I had been to many venues that surround it but never this one. 

I walked up and asked to see the menu. After a quick scan, I said Great! Let's grab a seat on the patio. I was allowed to choose my table and they would follow with a menu.

Upon arriving at my table, I asked if they could put up the umbrella as it was sunny and warm. Yes. I was told. After a few minutes time, I put up the umbrella myself and carried it into a suitable position. 

As I sat with patience waiting for my menu, I digested the wonderful view. It is a great spot to sit outdoors. I finally got up a and got my own menu and waited for my server.

I can't recall his name but he did a good job. It was funny because I ordered a Diet Coke and their wings. He said \"alright, something easy.\" The wings were wings and my simple meal was just that. It will be nicer when they finish the patio extension/remodel.

They might be shooting for retro in dress. My server had on jeans with both knees ripped out. I'm not sure but it seemed odd to me being 30 years in the business. I am getting to be an older cat now. Anyway, I'll try them again with friends once the patio is done. All in all, I give it an OK.

{"text":"This place is so great. Their menu offers a lot of different items with all sorts of backgrounds, American, Mediterranean, Mexican, etc. Venue is comfortable, they do not have a parking lot so expect to walk or pay $6 for valet. Waitresses were great and knowledgeable of the menu. Beer is delicious, I recommend getting a $12 flight to try 4 of their beers. Their brownie desert was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Food is not bad for a bar type place. The tacos were mediocre,  not sure if I would get again. Waiter we had was pretty blah. No personality/seemed like he'd rather be elsewhere. The outside patio is nice and pretty large overlooking N Scottsdale rd."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, so I was excited to see a Scottsdale location. The foods was very good (steak salad, chopped salad, fish tacos and Mac and cheese). The building is very industrial feeling.  

The beer is great! I love that they have beers I can't get back at home."}
{"text":"In town for work down the street and stumbled upon this awesomeness by walking by before the crazy dinner crowd. Very typical taphouse, micro brew decor with a trendy little twist with the glass walls and metal. 

Even though it was early, staff was friendly and eager to help. Happy hour has half off all apps. They brew their own awesomeness, so if you havent been there before tell them and they can give you the run down. 

Oh did i mention some home town props, this place is out of DuPage County Illinois, specifically Warrenville, right by where i grew up so it was awesome to see the Blackhawks flag flying since they just won the cup!!! They even have some omage in the beer names.

The menu was pretty diverse, with the usual burger and fry fare, along with some Arizona, green chili, smoky pepper treats to try. Give this place a try if you are in town and want to just hang out and relax.

Faves: cinnamon root beer, hummus, beer fries"}
{"text":"Came to this brewery after a fun run with the Fleet Feet group.  

Overall this place was large and spacious and definitely fits a lot of patrons if need be.  We sat on the patio with since it was a cool night.  They have craft beers of their own, but nothing really stood out to me as distinguishable that I can say -- wow!  I shot for the Outlaw; an India Pale Ale since I've been recently into IPAs.  Overall, I nice finish and bold taste with a slight hint of floral aroma.  For my food I went for the Oldtown Burger.  It came along with Chorizo, Pablano, Jack cheese, and onions on a Brioche bun.  The burger was cooked perfectly the way I wanted it; medium rare.  The chorizo and pablano really provided the heat while the onions made it a tad bit sweet.  Overall, a decent burger.  I don't really care for the Brioche bun for my burgers I guess.  

In the end, I hope Two Brothers Tap House continues to strive.  I appreciate small breweries making it happen in the scene and giving the major beers a run for their money!  The place is super spacious and has many television screens for a great sports bar atmosphere. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dangit Two Brothers, pay your electric bill! The power went out! 

But let's be real, this place has a great vibe. The drinks are great, the space is wide open, and the bar is very classy. While the power was out, the team was very communicative with my group and helped us all get our bills in a timely manner, given the circumstances. I'll definitely be coming back, just please make sure you don't run out of the white chocolate ale!!"}
{"text":"I think Two Brothers is going to do very well.  The building is very large but still welcoming.  The exposed brick and steel beams are kind of a modern industrial look.

The bar area is pretty large and has just enough TVs so that you can watch a game without being overwhelming.

Since they have been in the Chicago area for quite a while they have a broad selection of their own well-made beers already to go here in Scottsdale.  They hope to be brewing on the second level of the Scottsdale location very soon.

I liked their Wobble IPA and their Domaine Dupage ale quite a bit.  I also tried their mac and cheese with bacon which was great.  I wasn't wild about their salmon dip as it seemed more like something you'd smear on a bagel than dip pita or celery into due to it's firm texture.

All in all, it was a fun visit.  I'll be sure to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Great beer, good selection of beers brewed on property.i tried them all!!!! Had the guacamole bacon burger awesome, cooked as ordered(med rare) side salad and everything  worked great for my low carb way of life."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Don't come here if you are looking for a great meal. Mediocre bar food with half off appetizers during happy hour. The reason for the missing two stars was mainly the service. Bar staff just stands around in the back and doesn't acknowledge newcomers that sit down. Due to large location, it tends to always feel empty, but gains stars for dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"This Brewhouse features some great pub food and a fine selection of beers. We got a couple of flights before deciding which beer to go with. It worked out really well. Their selection is great the location in old Scottsdale is great. Finding parking during peak hours might be your only difficulty here but there is public parking available across the street"}
{"text":"Tried two brothers and loved the atmosphere, great beer selection and I tried a cider which I didn't love but it was the only cider they had. We ordered a pretzel too which was a little dry but overall our experience was good. The staff was friendly and the beer selection and food menu was large. Have a great patio and tv's too!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast (they recently started breakfast service): Nice server, good food, horrible (cheap-tasting) coffee... Server brought wrong toast and forgot the bacon. They need to polish it up to shine in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sixteen beers on draft ! 

We stopped in for a few cold ones before dinner. We sat at the bar, chatted with the friendly bartender and talked about what those 16 drafts were like. 

I went with a Lyin' Eyes White Stout (6.1 ABV) and thought it was tremendous. Super drinkable and refreshing.

They have a huge dining room and a huge food menu -sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, appetizers, and salads. I did see one cool thing on the menu - Hoisin-Sriracha Glazed Brussels Sprouts ! 

After our beers, we checked out their cool souvenir store. We enjoyed our visit quite a bit, and agreed if we lived here, this would definitely be in our dinner rotation."}
{"text":"Upon arriving parking was easy.We had kids with us no issue at all.The server was friendly as well as hostess.Gave kids crayons and coloring menu and were happy to see kids.We ordered wings and pretzel and awesome cheese sauce as appetizer.Which both were great..I recommend ordering the Domaine dupage beer and the coffee beer is interesting but good!!All of the 2 brothers coffees are fantastic They ground daily.I ordered the smoked brisket Reuben and she got the steak frites.Outstanding the wait for the food was a bit.But honestly its well worth it.Just order some beers.EVERTHING is FRESH.made to order!!kids menu is great as well.Also pick up a growler 4 bucks and 8 bucks or so for the beer!!!Only thing was the bar staff at the bar truely is lacking on beer knowlege!! Outside dining area is nice"}
{"text":"When I found out they only have their beer on tap, I thought they would have a limited selection. I was wrong. They have a wide selection of local brews and beer from their Chicago location. While I was there they were having issues with their CO2 and the beer poured a little rough. I appreciate that the bartender was open with me about that and let me know what beers were pouring well."}
{"text":"Just paid $18.65 for an Irish coffee that took 20 minutes to arrive and did not include the Irish cream when it did, despite my being told it was part of the drink. The shot of Irish cream took another ten minutes, and when the bill arrived it turned out that a shot of Irish cream cost $8. For future reference please just tell folks when the constituent parts of a drink are going to be charged individually. An Irish coffee is not a $19 cocktail."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour price beers on our last day in town for spring training.  It was pretty empty but we were served quickly and had a good time. My husband enjoyed the red ale and our party was confused by the white stout. The color didn't match the taste, but still great! The board games by the hostess stand are nice to provide entertainment for your table. Definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds were ok. Hard to say they're good when the cheese is melted out for the most part. Short rib sandwich was on a thick bun so was very dry (we did order without the mayo). Would have been better with an au jus to dip in. We asked and the waitress said they didn't have anything like that."}
{"text":"This was a very nice establishment, loved how they set it up. The food options gave you left overs if your not a big eater and are priced as expected with any place you visit such as this."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and drink menu was good for a night out. Service and food was sub-par."}
{"text":"Came here on the Christmas Eve and had lunch and it was a great experience. They had a very good variety of beers and the server (Alex) was knowledgeable, friendly, and spent time talking with us about beer. Our favorites were Ebel Weiss (Amazing), the dry stout, Domaine Dupage, and the milk stout. 
The burgers (grass fed) and fries are delicious and the rest of the menu looks really good. They seem to take their food and beer seriously."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour. While our waitress was fine, I had a watered down cocktail which I was extremely unimpressed with. Additionally, they were out of food on multiple occasions, on the same visit. I asked for the vegetarian meatballs and she told me the had just put the \"axe on that 5 minutes ago\" and then my friend tried to order fish and chips and they were out of the fish they used for fish and chips. How do you run out of food if your business is a restaurant? Unfortunately I have no interest in giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, staff not real attentive but  appetizer was okay.  Nice  atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was excellent - loved the fish tacos and roast beef sandwich. Truffle Parmesan fries were amazing. Service was excellent. Only open two weeks but we are sure this place will be packed as time goes on!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to hangout and drink beer. The beers are great. They have a wide selection of beers that they brew on-site.  The food was good too. I had the Cuban Sandwich which was good."}
{"text":"Being from Illinois and watching Two Brothers grow from a small brewery into the powerhouse it is today has been amazing! 

We went to take some friends to the airport after visiting and we all decided to check out the tap house!  Located in the heart of an area of business and shopping trying to find street parking wasn't super easy but wasn't a challenge by any means either.

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating for us with two small children.  The entire bar was clean and inviting and the waitress took the time to make recommendations on various beers when I ordered my flight.  The food was outstanding!  The cheese curds were extremely crispy but still light and not over the top.  The Brussels sprouts were very good with a great flavor profile but with the soy sauce on them they were a little on the salty side (definitely a dish to share!)

It was raining as we went so the beer garden wasn't open but it looks like a wonderful place to enjoy an evening after work drink as well!"}
{"text":"Great beer, with some of it made here, the rest back in Illinois. Also, classic bar food with a twist."}
{"text":"Two Brothers was awesome! Great atmosphere! Casual dinning!  Our server Curtis was amazing. He told us what items on the menu were the best.   Drinks at the bar were really good.  Food and dessert was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good when done right. Some of our dishes were awesome but others were horrible like cold meatballs that were asked to be warmed up and returned still cold. They ran out of sour cream and didn't have a few of the beers they had listed. The server did not have good customer service, didn't apologize for any of the mishaps and just kind of ignored them. Was definitely disappointed in my experience. I get things go wrong but could have been handled much better."}
{"text":"This place could be a great place, but needs some changes. First the good... the menu and food was good. The beer was OK too. This is a brewery but was out of their headliner IPAs. Really, how do you do that? Then the cement outside was very dirty, the fireplaces were dirty where people sat food (clean and then seal) and the cushions on the furniture needed to be replaced a year ago. We sat near the entrance and watched people comment on the filth and walk away. Service was fine. Clean the place up, get some beer in stock and you might do well!"}
{"text":"After walking around old town for a couple hours, my husband desperately needed a good beer! We stopped in around 3pm and sat on the patio. We had great service, and the beers were really good. We also had some pico de gallo salsa which was really delicious..nice and spicey."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that we had a bad experience at this place. This was our FIRST stop for our mini vacay and we were exited to try some beers. The male bartender barely spoke, and was NOT FRIENDLY at all. Told my husband we better hurry up and finish, as we seemed to be bothering him. On a lighter note, the cider and the cream ale were good."}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer, 1 star for the service. Mind you, we were at the most one of three groups there on a weekday around 3pm, and we were sitting at the bar. Isn't a bartender supposed to stay behind the bar? It took us 20 mins to flag her down to get waters after our first round of beer. You think they would give you water as courtesy before anything else, but not here.  I guess going to the back room or the front to talk to her coworkers were more important. Beer on the other hand was great, but there's plenty of good breweries in Phoenix so idk if I'll be back due to the service alone."}
{"text":"The bar staff is friendly and very knowledgeable. The food is always delicious and it is a fun atmosphere. Great place in old town to catch up with friends and drink delicious beer!"}
{"text":"We saw this place only had 3.5 stars but we decided to try it anyways because my husband loves beer. We loved it! We came on a Sunday around noon and they had great drink specials, all $4.  The white sangria was a little sweet but delicious, Bloody Mary with all the fixings, spot on mimosa and a beer of the day.  The food was really good and reasonably priced. We got the brezen pretzels and the beer battered cheese curds. Love that both come with two sauces to choose from! And the service was excellent. Overall an exceptional experience for the price."}
{"text":"While visiting my brother in Phoenix, we wanted to go to dinner in Old Town. We walked around, saw this place, and thought it looked like something we wanted to try out. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful and took our drink orders right away. I ordered a pizza and my brother ordered a burger, both of which were good! I liked the pizza a lot, and my brother said the burger was good too. The only thing that was really odd was that the restaurant was SO empty for a Saturday evening and we really weren't sure why. Overall, a pretty good spot!"}
{"text":"Nice setting right on Scottsdale Road. We sat outside and it was lovely. I'm not a beer drinker, so this review is on the food alone. I understand that the beer is great.

We had the guacamole duo and it was good, although the two guacs tasted very similar to me. I think they just added some feta cheese to the second one. It was good but nothing special. The nachos served with it were also ok, nothing special.

We then had the Cuban sandwich which was a bit of a disappointment. The bread was fair, and the sandwich was not made with love. The meats and cheese were something you would get at a grocery store, and it was put together with some pickles and run of the mill yellow mustard. 

Not great, not terrible, but there are lots of other restaurants in the area with good food."}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant! Had a coupon they sent me in the mail. The food was delicious! Came out very quickly and the waitress was very attentive. Almost too much but she was training sometime so it was understandable. All in all great experience and fun vibe. Ill def be back! :)"}
{"text":"Okay food, overall. We really like the cheese curds. Our table got two orders of quesadillas, only one came out with sour cream, so when we asked for another, we were informed they had run out of sour cream. A few of their listed beers were out as well. The meatballs came out cold unfortunately. Like I said, overall good taste, but just some aspects weren't up to par. The customer service was not good."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and stopped in on a whim tonight. Really enjoyed it.  Service was great.  Everyone real friendly.  Had my two kids with us and they are 13 and 16 and the kids menu items looked real good.  I had the BBQ pizza which was delicious with cojita cheese and pulled pork on it. The pulled pork was nice and smoky.  It was pretty big for an individual pizza with nice thin crust.  My wife had the grilled shrimp salad and she enjoyed that as well. I had the house IPA called Wobble.  Nice and hoppy without knocking you over.  Will definitely stop in my next time through."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic beers! It's a great Chicago oasis in the desert. I had the Tap House Burger and a Cane and Ebel beer. Both were great. I talked beer brewing 101 with the bar tender and watched the Blackhawks crush the Maple Leafs on one of their many tvs. If you're into craft beers you have to go here!"}
{"text":"First time here on a thursday after work for a happy hour and dinner with a friend. The location is awesome but the parking is not no where to be seen! Have to park around the corner or valet. Not a fan of that as its old town and its hard enough to find parking. 
When you walk in the architect of the building is awesome. I love the high ceilings and the style they have placed with steal beams and the wood work. It looks almost like what a club should look like with the levels of seating. Had a drink at the bar while I waited and bartenders were good, friendly. I like how they made the experience intentional by getting my name and referring to me by it the whole time. It goes a long way to make you feel welcomed. 
As I sat i realized this place was huge, but with no one inside made it feel too big. 
Sat out on the patio for dinner, great food! Had the burger and it was just as good as any other one on the blvd. I liked the patio area but can use a little upgrade as it a big plain to look at. Needs more curb appeal! And they need to do something to get more people in the doors for the overall experiance. 

For the Beer... as it is s brewery! Really happy with the taste of the IPA's. I am a big IPA fan and the Wabble was great! Highly recommend it and the other IPA they have. They carry their own selection of beer but also have bottles and cans of locals I think I saw. 

Will be going back to see what else they offer. Bartender said the breakfast was good so that might need to be the next adventure for this location."}
{"text":"Place seems empty a lot. We sat for beer and some food, Bartender was courteous, Bill was a bit high for happy  hour,. They do have a lot of real nice craft beers and if that is your thing you may like what they have done. Not all hokey, more trendy beer choices now. If it'snice out, sit outside and watch all the oturists ogle your food. Its in a very touristy part of Old Town and will likely be very busy during Spring Training,"}
{"text":"DOG FRIENDLY PATIO! Kind of hard to find dog friendly spots in the area but this place is VERY! Tasty beers, great food, exceptional staff! Loved sitting on the patio. Vegetarian friendly as well (& the server told me they are very accommodating to special needs diets like gluten). Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Arrived with a group of 6 for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was empty but seemed trendy. We were immediately seated outside where we waited for 10 minutes before placed our drink orders. The water. Brought out 6 waters but never returned. We waited another 15 minutes for our drinks, which never showed up. So we left. We did go in to inform the hostess that we were leaving,  and she said \"okay!\"  

I will not return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite patios to sit on, with a beer (Ebel's Weiss) and Beer Brezen or wings and enjoy Scottsdale's beautiful weather!

The beer and beer inspired cocktails are fantastic, the food is delish (my friends die for the cheese curds and the nachos), and we love the Chicago tie and vibe, being from Chi-town originally :)

I highly recommend this spot! Bring your pup - they have dog beds and bowls! They also have fun board games to play"}
{"text":"Late night dinner after a long drive. Nice enough place open good music and a lot of tv...so why 3 stars  food food food. It really amazes me that a simple burger .while good , you can't go the extra mile and just commit to do it right.  
Fish and chips were excellent. Staff was great."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!   We enjoyed the patio  seating, not realizing we stopped at a restaurant with Illinois roots (our home state).     The nacho plate was HUGE and we could have sat with that as a meal...but I also ordered a burger - the fizzy drizzle (or something like that?!).   It had mushrooms, two large delicious onion rings and a side of truffle fries.   They cooked the burger perfectly and the fries were yummy.   My husband had a chicken sandwich and also liked it!   Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I live in chicago so I love two brothers beer. While I was on vacation with my fiancée we figured beer and food quick lunch. We sat at the bar. Our bartender was a tall ditzy unfriendly blonde. Never greated us, made recommendations for beer or food. We decided pretzels and the Ruben sandwich. First pretzels we're cold. Ask to just nuke them quick. (We had to get her over since she never checked in) then our sloppy sandwich that looked like it was dropped on the floor and thrown on a plate came out. NASTY AND UNAPPEALING. We had to ask several times for the check. It was VERY unpleasant. There was never an apology we also waited a good 25 mins to get the cold pretzels back. I want to also add it was not busy. At the bar was us and 2 guys on the other side. They also looked pissed. GET PEOPLE WHO CARE IN THERE... I not only wasted money but my time"}
{"text":"They brew their own beer and have a great venue. But the bartender was annoyed to be there. He took his time but once he came over I asked if they had an IPA. He said, \"four.\" I asked if any were a little citrusy. He said, \"not really.\" I said, \"OK give me a Wobble IPA.\" As I drank it I read their menu, which described their 20 year anniversary IPA as being brewed with Denali hop that features big juicy notes of pineapple, citrus and tropical fruit. Nice effort."}
{"text":"Awful service, burger medium well was served rare, waitress never checked on us. Beer was goid. Wouldn't go back.!!!!!!! & we drink lots of beer and have lots of visitors."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give it a negation score. Service was terrible, food was sub par at best, management was non existent. Total waste of time and money. Save yourself and go somewhere else, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Food service was kinda slow but the food was good. Outdoor seating was comfortable and we could park our bikes right by our table. Waitress was friendly. Prairie path ale was really good!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a few friends. I love Chicago so anything that comes our way makes me happy and eager to try. We were hunting for a nice patio with comfortable seating and we lucked out, getting the area with the nice patio furniture.. The beer selection is good, and priced really well. The menu looks good, what we tried wasn't great so we are hoping that as time goes on it improves. Our server was very nice, he seemed new and getting used to everything which wasn't any big deal to us - he let us know they just started brunch so we will be trying that out Sunday. Overall, we are all hoping for this places success, there's a lot of options in Old Town to go to but this place just had a good vibe and good people and we enjoyed it. To the point we couldn't believe we had spent 3 hours there - if they hadn't been closing we probably would have had another round and kept hanging out.

Looking forward to the second phase of the brewing on site."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Love the beers, and needed to check out the food. Went with the family after a stop at McCormick train park. Got seated right away, as it was pretty slow. Still - took close to 10 minutes for our server to show. Still, we ordered an app, food for the kids, and a beer sampler. All came out quick and we had no issues. The biggest issue we had was when our meals came. My wife ordered a Cuban panini. On the menu it was to come with pork loin, ham, provolone, and fixings. What we got had bacon, pork, a red pepper, avocado. We asked the waiter and he said \"no, that's turkey\" took it away but came back with the same sandwich swearing it was the Cuban. Odd... It was OK and we're not the type to fight so we said ok, no problem. The manager came by a few minutes later and swore the sandwich was what we ordered but offered to make something else for my wife.  LEARN YOUR MENU. It's not on us to tell you how to make the food on your menu, but if a Cuban is ordered, serve a Cuban. Good thing is --- their beer is available at other places. Places that know how to get an order right.

I am debating whether to chalk this up to new place learnings, or take it more seriously.

All said, the burger I ordered was great, the kids liked their meals, and the beer was good. Just wish we didn't have to deal with this. We know what we ordered, and what we got wasn't it."}
{"text":"This place is the reason I got yelp, NEVER GO HERE I GIVE IT 2 MONTHS TILL IT CLOSES! The staff has no idea of what is on the menu and doesn't not understand that hands do not count as silverware and napkins. I would have rather gone to McDonald's and made a large donation to a local non profit organization the spend money at that hell hole. The only thing I reccomend here is the truffle frys and jack Daniels , the food sucks as well as the beer."}
{"text":"Close to the heart of Old Town. Upscale hip bar and restaurant. Watch site for Husker n Arizona! Good food and atmosphere. Super outdoor dining."}
{"text":"I come here every now and then for HH w/a friend who eats/drinks gluten-free since they're one of the few places around that serves a gluten-free beer (and it's actually their own). I usually get the Ebel Weiss, and it's honestly one of the best hef's I've had. 

As far as food we usually split the nachos. It's HUGE & yummy & has BOTH melted cheese and cheese sauce (as well as a spicy green sauce that's just delicious). This is usually enough for the two of us (it's pretty gargantuan), but I have tried other things that I remember being really good (I think a couple of the pizzas & salads). Also, both kinds of fries they serve are yummy. 

This is really good space in Old Town (It used to be that bar w/the mechanical bull). There's two levels w/tables & a large open bar. There's also fire pits on the patio for when it's cold outside. I can't remember ever having bad service here."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and the tv's had sports on. I ordered a beer they Brewed upstairs, called hot rod. It's a pale ale and very crisp and good. I also got the nachos with chicken. Added s little green cholula and I couldn't stop eating them. They were delicious!!!! Seriously, order these never ending chips. They were generously layered with cheese, beans, all the fixings and more. We were on vacation and we're happy to find this restaurant"}
{"text":"The beer is tasty. Be on the lookout for fruit flies in your beer tho!
The service was fine but TWICE they brought out a beer with a dead fly in it.
HOLD THE FLIES PLEASE! 
The waitress acts as if that commonly happens well if that's so I'm not coming back. Can't wait to get back to the California breweries!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after getting our car checked in the area.  Will be coming back. The Brussel sprout appetizer was phenomenal and the spicy bacon pizza was excellent.   Will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Decent food and beer.  The service is another story.  The waitstaff treated us with utter disrespect.  Half the table got food late and the other half didn't get it until we were ready to leave almost an hour after we sat down.  He claimed he forgot to put in the tickets.  We were never asked if we wanted refills on drinks either.  When we asked for the checks to be split, we were told yes but that it would take much longer.  Indeed, we waited a long time for those checks to come, as if we were being punished for a perceived misdeed.  With all the great spots to eat and drink in Scottsdale, there is no reason to return here.  Avoid."}
{"text":"They really suck at cooking burgers. Awful. How do you mess that up?  I have been to many grill outs where the grill master was many beers into things and he still kicks out a decent patty. But these folks feel the need to turn everything into a hockey puck. The beer is fantastic but everything food related must have been cooked by the ladies running the kitchen at my junior high. Grab a beer and head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Walked in they had 12 tables open not cleaned and said it was going to be a 40 minute wait. The hostess was rude and just didn't want to prep a table"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and brewmaster.  Food was excellent and the beer was fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and stopped into Two Brothers for dinner.  It was a Tuesday night so it was pretty dead. I just sat up at the big U shape bar. I started off with the Revelry IPA and really enjoyed it. The Outlaw was good but more of a standard IPA...easy to drink.  For dessert, I went with the brewed in house oatmeal stout. It was excellent. Just the right amount of sweet and the added lactose gave it a great texture.  

For food I just had the Scottsdale wings with the jerk dry rub.  They were good, but not mind blowing. I'll try one of the sauces next time.  

The service was fine.  There were only 2 other people at the bar so I had no problems getting anything I needed.

I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is really nice inside and in a good location. The parking is a bit of an issue. We went for lunch and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing but not terrible. I got the adult grilled cheese which was more of an Italian vegetarian panini than a grilled cheese. I would order it again. Definitely order truffle fries. The wabble ipa was good and decently priced ($5). Hopefully with time the food will improve and the service."}
{"text":"In the downtown area this is a great option for a traditional \"tavern\" decent outside shaded seating and plenty of TVs inside to catch a game. Their own   Beers on tap are great and lots of others to choose from. Although you might find better places to eat in the area the food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I was really disappointed in this visit. I'll also say, I've been here PLENTY of times before when I lived in Tempe and haven't been in awhile. It was always the place we'd meet up with friends a couple times a month. I'm giving it 3 stars to account for the great times and experiences in the past; but I'll say this most recent experience was not good and would probably be only 2 stars. 

We came here right around lunch. It wasn't too busy when we arrived but as we left it was picking up. 

We ordered two burgers, which we've had in the past and used to be flavorful and delicious - I was REALLY looking forward to lunch. This time, we really weren't impressed. They did not seem hand crafted and the flavors weren't bold and tasty as I remembered. It seemed pretty run of the mill. The fries were great as always though. My girlfriend got the tap house burger, which was supposed to have chorizo on it. She said in the past it had the chorizo on top of the burger and the menu sounded like it would, but this time it was not there. We asked the waitress and she said it 'might' be combined with the meat... but she seemed unsure. It did not look any different than my burger, which didn't have anything mixed into it. The flavor was off and we really didn't feel satisfied it was correct. 

You can't beat the brunch drink menu prices though. $4 for a monster mimosa, sangria, Bloody Mary (and there was one more.) I got a Bloody Mary, which was good but just not my favorite drink in general (not a tomato juice fan). My girlfriend got a mimosa, which lived up to being monsterous and great. We'd come back here for these drinks! I was gonna get sangria but they were out, which was also disappointing. 

The service was slow from beginning. After being seated the waitress took our drink order and walked away before we could give her our food order, which we knew from past visits. When she came back we ordered the food. After getting our meal she followed up briefly once and it was in passing when it appeared she had just remembered we were there. She asked if we were okay and began to walk away quickly before an answer was given. We stopped her as she was leaving to ask for additional sauces, which took awhile to get. Then she never came back until about 10 minutes after we finished to ask if we wanted our check...

Overall, I was really disappointed. The food wasn't that delicious and had no real flavor. The service was slow and we felt like we were just waiting around. As mentioned, we've been here before and loved the beer and all the food (we've tried a lot of it) but I don't think I'd get a burger again based off today. We gave it 3 stars hoping this was just a one time thing based on our past experiences; otherwise it would have been 2 stars."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of beers, friendly staff and the Cuban sandwich and coleslaw were great!"}
{"text":"Went to Two brothers this evening, though the Brussels sprouts were really tasty, the downfall was in the drinks. I ordered a coffee like a White Russian with Chocolate, the first one was made by the bartender, it was really tasty and not to sweet. The second was made by the hostess, still not sure why, but it was way two sweet. When the bill came, they charged us for two coffees which were 8.00, two shots of vodka which was 14.00 and two shots of a similar liquor to Kaluha, 16.00. So each drink averaged to around 20.00. Considering that the second one was just bad, all that they were willing to do was remove a coffee. We also ate food so I was very surprised and disappointed that they didn't remove the second drink. Won't be the first place I recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch for the first time and had a great experience. Their patio is dog friendly which is always a plus in my book. All of the staff was very attentive and friendly. Our waitress never left us waiting for anything. The food was also great. They have a nice variety of things on the menu too. Definitely I'll spot I'll stop back into."}
{"text":"Great place to come for some bar food and great beers. Parking is a bit tough, so park across the street and walk over. Two Brothers Tap House is rather large, two levels. Seems that most people sit downstairs to eat and drink than upstairs. Upstairs is more quaint. I did see a group of lady doing a painting class upstairs so maybe they have monthly events there? Not too sure.

If you're looking for some good beer, stop here. Nachos are good, wings are decent and their pretzels and cheese are bomb."}
{"text":"Spacious atmosphere, friendly waitstaff,  good beer and above average food.  All pretty much all you can ask for at a pub and it is competitively priced on top of that."}
{"text":"Came here for a work function and I am so happy I did! The food was great , the service was great and the homemade root beer was great. This place is amazing. Mac n cheese with bacon or pulled pork is the best. Home made root beer is good to! 

I have been back a few times since then and brought friends/co workers. I didn't even know this place was open for lunch. It's a ghost town inside. They need to do ads and get their name out there."}
{"text":"Took my entire family here (grandparents and parents included) and everyone found something on the menu while in Scottsdale on vacation. Burgers were delicious. Beers are outstanding. Cute little patio area in front! Very clean inside and service was attentive. Tons of TVs if you are looking to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times! 
The staff is super awesome and helpful. The nachos are wonderful and a favorrite. The food is always fresh tasting and good and it is a good place to go with groups!"}
{"text":"Two brothers is the type of spot you want to eat at when you have those Monday blues. Walked in today and got a whiff of that fresh paint smell because they just opened. The smell of money I tell you!

I like to sit at the bar when I go out to lunch, you know really live a little. Jennifer, who's a great bartender, was quick to greet us with a friendly smile and an introduction to their locally made beers. By local I mean brewed above the bar. #ohyoufancy. She gave us a great walk through of each of the beers and asked if we would like one? One I said in shock?! I'll have one of each. By then my co worker was co(drunk)ughing giving me an evil stare.  I said Michelle it's called a flight, ok. I know how to keep it classy.

What's important about Jen is I really wanted to spend the rest of the day enjoying each of their fine hand crafted beers. She wouldn't allow it. With a stern yet pleasant tone she said one and back to work with you. It's good to have responsible people in your life otherwise it would have been me drunk in an uber several hours later. Side note - anyone else ever use an Uber kind of like a therapist? It's great you get into the car drunk get to talk about what ever/ whom ever you want and boom you are home. I love it!

After that I ordered the ham and cheese panini which was more then enough food. Really enjoyed my lunch and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I tried all 3 IPAs that they had on tap. The Wobble was the best of a mediocre bunch. I couldn't drink the Outlaw, (guest tap). It tasted off.
Service was poor, server was absent most of the time, they seemed a bit disorganized.
We didn't eat there but our friends did and they had no complaints. I probably won't go back unless their beer improves."}
{"text":"Danny at the Tap House is very detailed to customer service and when I visit Arizona again I will visit the tap house"}
{"text":"My friend discovered this place through her work and I don't know why I never heard of this brewery before! They said they've been here for 2 1/2 years, and I think the word needs to get out of how awesome this place is! I sampled 5 beers and loved each one of them, and wrapped up the night with a delicious Reuben and their Parmesan truffle fries! 
Local beer lovers, this is a great spot to have some drinks, both from their local brews and the brews that bring over from their Chicago brewery!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best secret in Scottsdale.  This place is awesome.  Has an incredible selection of beers to choose from as well as cocktails.  The menu is not your typical bar food it's loaded with a variety of items you would never think of as well as a twist to items you may not have thought of. I ordered the fried chicken.  Thought I was getting a typical half chicken pan fried with a side of gravy and potatoes.  Not here.  I got all white meat served in a tasty sauce with a huge side of Mac and cheese with a tasty green bean red pepper side.  Everyone at the table wanted a taste.  My wife had the tap house burger with the chorizo and it was amazing. Tasty but not hot with spice.  Not sure how they did it.  I washed it down with an Ebel's Wiese.  As authentic German beer as you can get.   We sat outside in the heated patio.   Great experience.  Here's a tip.  The restaurant next door offers valet.  I pulled up to drop off my wife and I just asked them if we could valet and they said no problem.  So valet parking, great food and the best beer in the world.  This place is great."}
{"text":"Great patio and yummy beers. 

The food was very flavorful and the servers were nice and helpful. 
The reservation set up is a little strange. You can only put your name on the list in person. I tried calling because we had our dog, but that was a no go.  They don't have much space to wait around for the table except a small bar area or you will have to wait on the sidewalk.  We were able to get something fast enough and our dog liked the lounge couch/fire pit. A lot of seating inside and good number of tv's for sports."}
{"text":"We decided to use our Welcome to the Neighborhood coupon. We were glad we did!

The place has a very relaxed atmosphere.  The bartender was very friendly.  I knew it was going to be a good experience. 

The Kickin' Hound cocktail was a pleasant surprise. A mix of vodka, grapefruit juice and, wait for it, pale ale with orange, lemon and pineapple notes. Not a beer drinker and had to try the pale ale by itself to figure out why I was enjoying the cocktail.  It was the beer!  It's a tap house after all. 

Then came the pork belly wraps. The pork belly slices in each wrap was generous. It was topped with a pineapple and mango salsa. So yummy I ordered another one to go for lunch. The manager was very thoughtful. He put the salsa in separate containers so it did not make it soggy. 

We decided on the Ancho Skirt steak for our entree.    The chimichurri sauce was delightful. Steak cooked perfectly.  Trifecta :)

All the flavors melded together beautifully. But most importantly the service was superb. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I was concerned because this place always looks dead compared to the surrounding restaurants. We decided to give it a shot last weekend which turned out to be a great decision!

You can get a 4oz sample of almost any draft beer for $2-3. It's like a flight but better! You chose your beers and how many you want. Huge beer selection. 

The guacamole was great. They serve you two different kinds. One had strawberries in it. Sounds weird.... Nope! AMAZING! 

Don't let the emptiness of the place fool you. It's a great spot with a nice patio. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I am visiting Scottsdale for the first time and came here with my brother and cousin. We just finished hiking the camelback and wanted a yummy beer. We came around lunch and the place was completely empty. I liked the vibe of the place though and they had a good patio. The location of the restaurant is also nice. 

The beer menu was pretty standard but I felt like multiple beers didn't add up to what they looked like or tasted like. The descriptions were definitely off or we got the wrong beers. 

We ordered the chicken wings in medium sauce, the cheese curds, and a margarita pizza. The wings and the cheese curds were pretty average. The pizza was absolutely terrible and had absolutely no flavor. My cousin literally poured salt on hers to make it taste better, which also didn't help. In general, the pizza was overly bland and had no hope of being saved. 

The service was average as well. She was a little over the top at first, then forgot about us for about 20 minutes. She also forgot a couple different things we asked for. 

I definitely would be open to going back and trying something else, maybe a burger or something. It has great potential."}
{"text":"Right place, Right time. Thats 2 Brothers. I frequented the Warrenville location and saw that decline. This location is like 1929 stock market. Warm Beer, Cold Service, Microwave food. Times up Bro's. Terrible. Some of their beers are good if you take them to go. Appartenly the owners cant afford refrigeration.....review based on 2 vists...worst service I have seen in 2 years in AZ. Shame"}
{"text":"With a prime location in Old Town, we thought we couldn't go wrong with this Illinois-based brewery. Although being able to sit out on the patio with temperatures pushing 70 was relaxing and allowed us to people watch, we weren't impressed with the beer or the food. We arrived on an early Sunday afternoon with the first of two NFL divisional playoff games coming to end. But looking inside, the open two level space was clean with a horseshoe bar on the lower level and large metal brewing tanks dominating the upper level.

There was about a ten minute greet after being sat and given menus and the seasonal beer list. We found it odd that our server had asked us if we were drinking beer and after we said yes, she said that she asks because she has a whole spiel about the brewery, then proceeded not to give it to us? I'm sure she would have informed us in addition to their brews, that they have a list of interesting beer cocktails, or that they roast their own coffee, or maybe that you can take a growler to go? We'll never know.

I ordered the Two Brother AZ Milk Stout which has IBU score of 12, which for some reason, I felt that score was way off, it should have been two to three times higher. It had a very dry, bitter finish for a stout which was too much for me and that's saying a lot. My brother had the Imperial Cane and Ebel which he thought was OK.

For food, we started off with some cheese curds and beef nachos. And for entrees, I had the Southwest Short rib Sandwich with other entrees including the Frizzle Dizzle Burger, Fish and Chips, Waffle BLT, and a Grilled Cheese. Not too get complicated in describing the food, but greasy and old would be good terms. All of the food looked like it had been sitting out a while and maybe the fryer oil needed changed. The fish and chips, cheese curds (which were over fried), and nachos were the only dishes that were finished and that I would consider ordering again. With only two beers ordered, our bill worked to $20/person which I thought was pretty high given the food quality.

With a strong history and following, I probably picked the wrong beer and should have ordered a flight. But if I were to come back, I would just stick to the beer and eat elsewhere. We started off on the wrong foot here and never really got on track."}
{"text":"Decent beer but the service isn't very good. I would come back and give it another try. No wait staff at the front so we sat and the bar and it took a while before the guy came over to check Ids and get our order."}
{"text":"We hit this place up before going down to Fox to smoke some cigars.  We got there around 1:30pm and were seated at a high top table right away.  My buddies ordered a couple flights of beers, and I went with a chocolate chip cookie skillet type dessert (It was cheap, only like $3.50!).  

The cookie was pretty good...not as good as other places that do this type of dessert, but still hit the sweet tooth right in the gut!  It's a big chocolate chip cookie in a skillet, topped with ice cream.  The skillet was a tad too hot though, so it started to melt the ice cream right away. I got a few decent sized scoops of ice cream with my spoon, but after awhile, it became more like ice cream soup along with my cookie.  Still good, but could have been better.

My buddies loved the beer here.  They both got a flight (one buddy got 2 flights) and a pint each.  Said it was the best beer they had all weekend (we went to a few different spots).  

Service was great...forgot the name of our server, but she had a Sasha Grey type look to her.  Very friendly and welcoming!  

I will definitely be back to try out some of their food.  Everyone around us was ordering burgers, guacamole, cheese curds etc and everything looked fantastic!  They also have a California Burrito on the menu (I'm definitely ordering that next time!) which is rare, but awesome!  Good times!"}
{"text":"The Two Brothers brews was not great, but they do carry a number of other local drinks at reasonable prices. The patio was open, fairly empty, and the fire pits were running. Grabbing a drink by the fire was extremely pleasant. With the right company, Two Brothers makes for a nice casual spot for drinks and conversation."}
{"text":"So this place is brand new! Hence the \"hot and new\" tag from Yelp. However, I didn't know it literally opened a week before I decided to have my birthday celebration there. I was just looking for a brewery close by my home that I had never been to and Yelp led me to their front door. 

When I called to make a reservation, they were very nice and accommodating. I ended up reserving the \"private\" room they have near the back of the restaurant. I say \"private\" in quotations because it's a room with glass walls. 

I didn't order much food because I had eaten prior but I stole a few bites of my boyfriends pretzel with beer cheese and YUM! You can never go wrong with a soft pretzel and beer cheese. As for beers, I'm a huge fan of their hefeweizen. It was really really tasty and right up my alley. 

I'm excited to head back to try more of their food and experience the brewery!"}
{"text":"This brewery is the shit, the best business to take over this place since Saddle Ranch. The Domaine Dupage is a beer full of wonderful flavors that will take you on journey as if visiting Willy Wonka's factory. 

We split the Tap House burger which hit every spectrum of tastiness to spiciness in every bite. I've been to this place number our times and I have never had a bad time

I don't think I saw Josh pull out a note pad the entire time. He's got a memory like an elephant and the jokes of a hyena. The fact that he could keep up with us on every level is enough to say he is a damn good server."}
{"text":"We had a great time today outside on the dog friendly patio -- they even gave Scout a comfy bed and bowl of water! We started with the hot wings and then I ordered the chicken chop salad with quinoa and russ had the breakfast burrito brunch special with amazing French fries and the dragon eyes seasonal beer while I had the fresh-brewed iced coffee. Delicious! We love the new chef and this was the best food we've had since we've been probably 5 times now. We will be back most definitely and Alexandra, our server, was delightful! Thanks two brothers!!!"}
{"text":"Tap house & brewery, yes indeed. Out front there is a large outdoor seating, with heaters for the cool nights. Inside a large open area with many tall pub tables, a large u shaped bar, and then more tables around the room. We sat at the bar, greated by Russell, and enjoyed our beer & food.
They have a large beer menu, which is made up of mostly house made beers. But I love it, the list was diverse and worthy of exploring. I started with Twenty Plus Pilsner, a smooth drinking beer that was perfect. My husband had the High Noon, a cream ale. 
The bar menu has all you want, we ordered the Beer Brezen (soft pretzel) & Margherita pizza. Both were served hot and satisfyingly good in flavor.
We then each enjoyed another beer each, Ancestral Recall & Dragon Eyes. 
Overall we like Two Brothers Tap House, and plan to return. Especially since they are within walking distance of our hotel. Check them out."}
{"text":"Two Brothers.. What's not to like.. great atmosphere.. Friendly staff.. the food was great.. try the nacho's or burgers.. The wings looked tasty too !  Great Beers !  I really liked the smooth Outlaw.. IPA..  again.. They have been crafting  beers in Chicago for a while now so they have some great beer ready to go..They will be brewing on site soon..  Sitting outside was so nice.. perfect night.. cool.. people walking by.. Valet parking right in front.. This place is big not overwhelming..  nice big bar.. great bathrooms ladies.. They are BRAND SPANKING NEW.. Give them a Try.. peruse the menu for your favorite dishes.. The Cuban Sandwich looked enticing.. oh so many good food choices.. . so many good beer choices..  I guess we're just going to have to go back over and over again to test them all..  have fun.. drink responsibly.."}
{"text":"The lover loves breweries and really wanted to try this place out so we came by one lovely evening. 

We came during the week in the evening so there was no wait and we got seated right away. I absolutely loved everything about this place. The food is good, they have a very big menu, the beer is good, good customer service and a big patio that is dog friendly. I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. Super cheesy, just the way it should be. 

I love that they are dog friendly because that means we can bring our little brat. Our waiter was new, but he was extremely knowledgable and attentive. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good location, nice beer, meh food. Had the stuffed bell pepper, kids had nuggets, wife had kale salad. All in all it was fine but unmemorable and not someplace we'd go again"}
{"text":"Location is great, right in old town and walking distance to almost anywhere. Every time I have been there, it has been a great experience! Love the pretzel appetizer. YUM! Space is well used, and I love the patio lighting."}
{"text":"I have to give a HUGE thanks to the staff here at Two Brothers. We didn't plan like we should have so our reservation was super last minute and our number was way off (21 turned into more like 30) BUT the staff here was able to not only accommodate our large party but they also put up with every little request we had. Granted, one of our waitress looked like she was going to kill us, ALL Night, she still rolled with everything we were throwing at her. The food was amazing and the drinks just kept on coming. We weren't the easiest crowd but this wedding reception was a huge hit and it couldn't have happened without Two Brothers. Thank you all so much!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We ordered two of the kids pepperoni pizzas and they came out with cheese pizzas saying the kitchen was out of pepperoni (maybe ask if that is cool first), but we let that slide. Then they forgot to put in our orders for the adults meals and we sat around for over an hour before being told that there was some issue with the ticketing system. Then we were told that they were just waiting on our french fries to finish, but came out with super cold gross fries. They made it up by giving us 25% off of our pepperoni-less kids pizzas and waiving the adult meals which were sub par for the area. Def not going again ever."}
{"text":"The beer is okay; I tried a sour beer the other day that was super yummy but I'm more of an IPA gal and theirs were meh to me. The food Ive had has been good. Small portions for the price but what else is to be expected in Scottsdale? A couple veggie options that were made vegan by cheese or condiment removal so that was nice!"}
{"text":"Please go here and order the parmesan truffle fries and pretzel appetizer...so yum!  I've been here about 4 times now and the food is consistently good, the beer is flavorful, and I like the restaurant decor/openness.  We hope Two Brothers can overcome the location issue - we've noticed this particular spot on Scottsdale rd can be tough to draw customers.  We really like it here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Truffle Parmesan fries are to die for...I absolutely love them and they are my favorite french fry I've ever had in my life.  I don't even remember what my main courses were because I was in love with the fries so much!!"}
{"text":"I love two brothers beer and got to try a new one today,  the Blood Orange Pinball. It was delicious!  We started with wings,  which were just ok but the honey sesame sauce was great! My friend and I both had the pesto chicken sandwich,  which was good.  The chicken was tender and the pesto was flavorful.  Our boyfriend's both had burgers,  which they ordered medium rare but that came out medium well.  Even overcooked,  they both said they were still tasty. The service was a little lacking, it took at least 10 minutes before anyone even greeted us, and we weren't checked on much after the food came out.  We all would have ordered another beer,  but by the time we had the chance,  we were done eating. I'll be back,  if only for the delicious beer!"}
{"text":"Great tasting beers and food here.  Nice modern decor and friendly staff.  Looking forward to trying more menu items soon.  Located on east side of Scottsdale road, just barely north of 6th ave (next to Franco's Italian Cafe)"}
{"text":"We've been Two Brothers fans since conception, our family being from the Chicago-area it's a welcome treat. Im pleasantly surprised with the quality of the management evolution since the beginning and feel the vibe of the restaurant becoming more cohesive and welcoming. I most certainly recommend the mac & cheese (in an adult portion - for sure, bacon if you dare); and if you have to take kids for an excuse to eat it, i recommend borrowing one. When the Root Beer is on tap its another definite recommendation; oddly being at a brewery there are a million other things to try that are delicious; but the RB is by far one of the best ive ever had. I have to highly urge you sit on the patio should weather and sun permit, they have gone great lengths to make the seating comfortable and cool at all times, but never miss an opportunity to be outdoors and soak up the atmosphere; its a real treat..."}
{"text":"Saddle ranch has changed and sadly it took me a year to try it out. I came for their one year anniversary of Two Brothers.
The atmosphere is modern casual with a large open floor plan and upper balcony above the bar area.
The food samplings were delicious I definitely will be back when I'm in the mood for a burger and a beer.
However, I fear this place may not survive in the highly competitive restaurant and bar district of Old Town Scottsdale. I rarely see this place particularly busy. 
However, that doesn't stop me from buying their Two Brothers beers and other restaurants in grocery stores in the valley. Maybe they will find a crowd during the football season."}
{"text":"Great location cute patio and good service. Guacamole was gold and the chef's special has strawberries and feta in the hummus which was unique and actually pretty tasty. Didn't like the short rib sandwich which our server said was the manager's personal favorite. Didn't have a ton of flavor and even with an extra side of the chipotle mayo sauce it wasn't very flavorful and just didn't do it for me. My husband's fish tacos were good and his truffle fries were also tasty. He also ordered a beer-tini which he really liked. We'll go back I just didn't love the food I got so next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place!! They have lots of beer and other beverages to choose from. Their food is also really delightful. We had chips and guacamole and nachos and both were exceptionally great! I love the layout of this brewery- lots of open seating upstairs, downstairs and outside on the patio! 

They also have tons of fun board games to play with! So fun!!"}
{"text":"Two Brothers is like that hipster who wants to he a hipster, but doesn't wanna buy the entire wardrobe. Kinda of a half measure situation. Not to say that going half way is bad, but it has to be done correctly. Kinda like walking a tightrope, not a lot of room for error or improvisation. When it's done right it can reap its own rewards, but Two Brothers just doesn't pull it off.

it's a pretty safe choice if you are going out to eat. It has the traditional foods like hamburgers and such, and a pretty wide selection of drinks. But I always get the feeling the place is trying to balance the scales between appealing to a wide audience that just eats hamburgers, and that group of people who need a hard I.P.A.

I've been here quite often, and the staff is nice 100% of the time. However, sometimes they seem to drift off into what seems like the great beyond, and you're stuck wondering where you are. Your best bet if you're on a  schedule is ask for the check right after you order. Also, they've kinda dropped the metaphorical ball on the food at times. Gotten a grill cheese a few times that wasn't fully grilled, and you can't eat a cold cheese sandwich. It just ain't kosher.

But if you're in Scottsdale, hit it up. There is a 85% chance you're going to enjoy your meal. 95% if your'e not in a rush."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant concept, the atmosphere (on a busy night or busy brunch), I love the beer & the menu offers a nice variety in different tastes. I've had almost everything here & can say that each item is thoughtful & delicious. The building is kick ass & I love the bar area & outdoor seating. Overall I would definitely recommend this place!"}
