{"text":"Hotpot is the perfect food to for this season. This is our regular hotpot spot my boyfriend and I usually go to because they offer wide range of sauces and food selection also their soup broths taste very homemade. For 15.99 (roughly)  AYCE after 10pm special during the weekdays  Kim Tao is def a must try."}
{"text":"Boss's stingy with the food. Bad attitude and services from the boss and the workers. No one pays attention to what you order, even if u do tell them u want something, wait a good 30mins if ur lucky. Don't recommend people going. It's very frustrating and bad service."}
{"text":"Best hot pot I've been to in years. Went last week and it was so good we had to come back today. Love the variety and quality of the food."}
{"text":"AYCE restaurant that's got a large variety of food to choose from and even offers free iced lemon tea and prune juice. I always opt for the prune juice... It helps pass through all the food I stuff myself with! The restaurant is very large with several tables behind walls and around corners where you wouldn't expect them to be."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than having Hot Pot on a cold day and Kim Tao Hot Pot is the place to enjoy it at! It's an all you can eat styled restaurant and is usually always packed, but wait time is about 10minutes for a table since the restaurant itself is pretty big. Everything served here is fresh from their selection of seafoods, meats and veggies! They even have home-made cuttlefish balls, mmmm my fave. Here you can select 2 difference soup bases and make your own dipping sauces as well. Kim Tao Hot Pot is a great place to go to for AYCE hot pot. They serve fresh ingredients and have decent service - only because it's so busy so you'll have to wave your waiters down"}
{"text":"Decided to come here last minute with some friends. It was actually my first time ever to have hot pot in a restaurant. I always just eat it at home so I was excited to try it outside. First of all, bad mistake to come here on a Friday night because it was packed and super busy. Service sucked. They give you a piece of paper with the menu on it and you can choose your soup base and foods.   Honestly the food is not that bad. In fact, I really loved the dumplings they had.  But the service was just so bad that I could not enjoy myself. They kept missing orders and it was super hard to get a waiter. Staff was not friendly. Was also really disappointed that they were out of tripe.   Not sure if I would ever come back here. I think I'd rather stick to hot potting at home."}
{"text":"My only hot pot place,  food are up to standard and fresh, can see the owner put lots of efforts to maintain the standard. Their services vary depanding it's the most busy time you go or off peak time.    Except the hot pot food.  My favorite dishe there is the fried sticky rice."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad and found a fly in our food. The water was running low, when we tried to ask them to pour more water they just ignored us. At the end our soup was burnt because there was not enough water!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Nov 9, 2013.  Worst. Ambience. Ever.  They were doing construction during dinner rush hour!!!! Jack hammering away while patrons were eating.  R U serious?  The noise from the hurting was so annoying"}
{"text":"Thanks Em. L for the review on Kim tao's hot pot , my friends and I came to check it out and it deserved at least 4 stars because of the freshness of the food. We came around 8:30 and it wasn't too busy but the waiters had a lot to do because it took us a while to get our second orders in . Overall a great place to enjoy a meal with some friends at a pretty decent price . I've been to about 4 different hot pot places and this is for sure on the top of my list . Definitely recommend it ."}
{"text":"By far my favour hot pot in the area. They have a late night special after 10pm where food is cheaper.  Beef is fresh typically during winter time from my experience. Wasn't that fresh during summer time but that may have changed.  Lots of food choices.  Sauces are awesome, it's not communal like other places and they have lots of different choices for sauces, including ginger, green onion, red onion, garlic slices, diced garlic, cilantro and the basics like soy sauce, oyster flavour sauce, they have black vinegar, etc etc.  I like the octopus and the corn. Unfortunate they don't always have a certain vegetable I like, \"tong-ho\", but at least they have corn on the cob.  Their rice in ceramic pot with assorted meats is pretty good and has improved from last year.  Their dessert choices are somewhat lacking but I'm usually so full I have no room for dessert.  Service is attentive and good. I can see why some people may \"think\" the owner has a shitty attitude problem but I just think it's more of a misunderstanding. He has treated me nicely before. That's just my experience.  The food and soups are fresh and flavourful  and that is what counts the most.  Also they offer all you can drink lemon or plum tea."}
{"text":"Hot Pot! Perfect for a gathering of people! Well that is if you like to share your food. Also, this is not for people who are very particular on how food is served/cooked.  It is an experience, much like Korean BBQ, you sit around a communal cooking area, in this case a pot/large bowl of soup that is on continuous boil. You boil each piece of raw food that you order and then dip it into the dipping sauce that you personalize for yourself. De-lish!   The service is ok, the servers were prompt to take our order, but it took a while for our food to come out. But when it did, it came out almost all at once! In our 2 1/2 hour experience, the servers came to refill our pot 3 times, which I thought was good. The dumplings and the homemade beefballs were the favourite at our table, along with the watercress and the radish. But the fact that we ate basically everthing off of the seafood order also means that it was a hit as well. I'd also suggest the sticky rice that you eat on the side.  The restaurant itself is odd, the first room seems more normal than the sparcely decorated, larger second room. But I guess afterall, it's about the food, so I guess decor in this case is not really a big factor. The tile floors seem actually dangerous since there are large pots of soup being brought to each table, but I guess that the clean up is pretty easy if there was ever to be a spill.  Unfortunately I am not quite sure of the price, I think it must have been about $20-$25 per person (all you can eat)."}
{"text":"Don't judge this place by it's looks. It may seem a bit lacking, but the food is always good. The meats are fresh and really thinly sliced so they cook with just a few swishes in the pot, but my favourite is the handmade pork balls. Even though this is a hot pot place, the clay pot rice with chinese sausage is also really good! I always leave this place very full and satisfied.  In terms of service, they are usually ok for Chinese restaurant standards. However there was a time when we got seated in the other newer area in the back and it was really difficult to get a hold of someone. I do like how they have a table on the side to put the dishes that come. Also, I would suggest calling ahead of time to make sure there is a spot, they are always packed... or so it seems whenever I go there."}
{"text":"I was here on December 27, 2016 and the owner was charging us the higher holiday price. The waiter dropped off the bill on the table and we noticed that we were being charged the high price. I asked the waiter why are we being charged the holiday price? He stated he did not know. We enter the restaurant at 11PM and we should be charged the late night NON-HOLIDAY price. The 27th is 2 days after Christmas and the day after Boxing Day. The owner is very unfriendly and dishonest. I have been coming to this place for 15 years and to try and RIP us OFF is not cool. NEVER GOING TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!! DISHONEST PEOPLE!!!"}
{"text":"This is my to go hot pot place. I came here recently again and it's still absolutely amazing. All the food there is very fresh and there is tons of condiments and different kinds of food to choose from. I really love the fish noodles and fish paste. There also the deep fried fish skins. THOSE ARE AMAZING."}
{"text":"Went here for hotpot last night with a couple of bros. Ended up going in for about $28 each. So what did we get for our money? Well, a massive load of tripe for one. Seems that selecting \"1\" on the paper may get you more than you want, so choose carefully. We also ordered various meats, dumplings, balls, inners, veg etc. We managed to nuke a few things due to our own negligent style of cooking, however almost everything was tasted with a proper cook. The meat was disappointing. Found it tough and chewy. Nothing else really worth noting. Service was oook in terms of wait time, but there was an overwhelmingly blah attitude. Tbh I didn't really mind and enjoyed the lax environment. I'll most likely be getting my next hotpot fix somewhere else, as there was nothing to really keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Our family have been going to this place, everytime we head up to Canada, for years. We usually head up to Canada about 3-4 times a year. The food is usually very good and the price is fair. This time was major disappointment because the owner tried to RIP US OFF!!! We were there on Tuesday, December 27th, after 10pm. The owner tried to charge us a holiday price. I told the waiter \"today is Tuesday and not a holiday\". The waiter said I don't know. I told the waiter that Boxing Day was yesterday, Monday. Today is Tuesday and not a holiday. The owner was finally willing to change the price to a regular weekday night price. This is such a disappointment. We will no longer be going this place again."}
{"text":"On weekends it's 18.99, it's not worth 20 bucks, maybe 15.99 (weekday) or 12.99 (after 10pm). Went during prime dinner time on a sun, it was packed. Service was terrible though.. The teenage girls who seem to be servers tried their best not to work, seemed like they were just pretending, standing around and looking at things. We gave one of them our order (it was our second order) and she didn't put it through. It was annoying. Waving them down doesn't seem to work, but I guess because they only had like 5 people doing everything in a packed restaurant, and it's a big area. The food was okay, nothing special. The guy who seemed like the manager seemed extremely annoyed with any questions. The system is to just mark down what you want and give it to the waiter. There should be minimal talking if the wait service did things correctly, but that wasn't the case, We didn't even order anything, other than the broth, but they didn't come to our table, not even once, for half an hour. The girls go by our table and see our order but ignore it. FYI The manager gets annoyed VERY easily. There's only one employee there that won't make you feel bad when giving in your order, and that's the older small asian lady. To be honest, it's a stressful environment, with all the noise, people, and unhappy workers who don't want to be there and aren't afraid to show it. I'm chinese and I know you have to wave down people to get your order in chinese restaurants, but this was just terrible. Definitely won't be going back. We just wanted food, but for some reason it was extremely difficult to obtain it at this restaurant. It might have been a bad day for these people, but they really shouldn't show it in their service. If you just want meat with veges, I would recommend Chingu on Leslie, near this restaurant (or the other two korean bbq restaurants near there such as Chako or the one at commerce gate). If you want noodles with meat in broth, just go to a pho (vietnamese) restaurant. All these places have 100% better service for the same type of food. There is also an AYCE Japanese restaurant called Osechi with the same ordering system but way more efficient. They don't even mind when you talk to them!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible everytime we ordered meat they would only give us one plate Regardless of what we has written on the sheet.. Would not recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Food is comparable to other places but the horrible service is really a turnoff.  I have been to this place a few times in addition to iCook, Dow's Noodle hotpot so I can compare the experience.  Yesterday would be my last time eating at this restaurant.  The service was absolutely horrible.  Restaurant was over 100 diners with about 5 servers.  You do the math!  We asked for foods like tofu, noodle, dumpling and vegetables all of which should be readily available without cooking.  However it took a long time to come.    My friend talked to the owner/manager.  Without asking us which table number, he yelled at his staff \"why didn't this table have foods\".  We knew he was bullsh*ting because he didn't ask for our table number and what kinds of food we were waiting for.   At the end of the dinner, I brought it up with owner/manager that the service was really slow.  Without even a word of sorry, he was just shrugging his shoulders and said it's was a busy night.  Well, since you are running the restaurant and know how busy it is, you could have get more staff to come in on a busy night.   Overall, including tax and tip, it came out around $28 per person which is a standard rate for all you can eat.  Yet the way you are ill-treated surely will leave a bad taste.  Do yourself a favour, spend it at other places that make your dinner a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The service is poor!!!! And 10%tips is include the price! I just want to order the cron,I ask so many time! Don't think me come again!!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and it wasn't really busy given it was past 10PM. We got two soup bases, the chicken and the satay and both were really yummy. I really enjoy this being all you can eat for 16 bucks on the weekdays. The selection is great and it all tasted pretty good.   The only thing I don't like about this place is the service. Some people like to order seconds or thirds (because this is AYCE so naturally you order more). We ordered A LOT the first round so we didn't need to order a second time. However, even then the waiters never came back and it wasn't even busy. Also they were really rude while we were paying. When we were looking at the bill they pulled the bill out of our hands. They even threw the receipt at us.   I would give this place 4 stars had the service not been so horrible."}
{"text":"I couldn't let this brutally cold winter pass without going to hot pot even once so I was set on satisfying my hot pot cravings.  Normally, I go to iCook just for the convenience of having my own pot, picking my own meat and vegetaables and serving myself.  However, we were heading out around 9pm on a Thursday night and to my surprise, was told by iCook staff when I called that they were closing at 10pm.  Surprising and disappointing but it gave me the opportunity to try out Kim Tao (since it was the only place that I knew open late).  Kim Tao has a late night hot pot special that starts at 9pm on a weeknight.  For $15.99, you get the normal hot pot or you can pay $2 more for the fatty beef.  We stuck with the $15.99 option since it came with beef anyways.  As for broth, we ordered the satay broth and the preserved duck egg.  The menu selection was okay - it was not as extensive as the selection at iCook but they had the fresh meat balls and chicken wings.  For dessert, they only had cold mango sago or hot taro sago.  These were not special but not bad either.  My experience was pretty consistent with what everyone else said in their reviews.  Service stucks but they still tack on a 10% service charge to every bill.  Overall, it hit the hot pot spot but it's definitely not a place I would go out of my way to visit (especially since I don't live around Richmond Hill)."}
{"text":"The restaurant is gigantic, with lots of large private rooms, large booths, and tables. Perfect for large group dining. The all-you-can-eat beef option is $18.99, with seafood option is $20.99, with discounted price of $16.99 after 10PM. There is an array of soup flavors, with only small fees for the specialty soups. There are a lot of sauces that you can order, given that the table comes with satay sauce, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, the basics etc. There is an endless selection of food options, all of which were fresh. One of the best thing about this restaurant is that they bring you pitchers of lemon tea and/or plum juice. It's not the best, but it's bottomless, and FREE, so I'm sure no one is complaining.   This is definitely a go-to place for all of you hot pot lovers! It will definitely satisfy your cravings!"}
{"text":"When it comes to hot pot, the soup base MUST be good for the meal (imo) to be actually good. I only eat one soup base when I eat hot pot, and its the Tom Yum soup. The Tom Yum soup here is delicious! Meats are great too, but can vary on quality depending on the day. Meat balls and dumplings are also good! DO get the sticky fried rice :) It comes with PEANUTS so if you're allergic, I suggest you don't get it.  The best hot pot restaurant in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Came here over the winter break to see my high school friends, also noted this as my first Canadian foray into AYCE Hot Pot!  I was surprised by a few things  Positives: Selection - Large! Flavour - Enjoyed the bases given Specific dish - Hand made balls were great!  Negatives: Price - Steep, wallet was weeping (alliteration!) Quality - Veggies were meh Flavour - One of the bases was high on the salt spectrum.  Since it is my first foray, and I am biased towards wanting to eat on the healthier end this review is not looking good for those looking to manage their BP. Would only recommend as a very once in a while treat, even then there might be some better options.  Will Keep Looking!!"}
{"text":"3.5 rating.  A Hole in the wall place. It's rough around the edges. But the food is great. This place has been here for ages. It has gone through several expansions and a few renovation (not done very well tho).   It's extremely busy during the winter months but that self explanatory.  Normally have the clear soup and satay base.   Perfect place for 2 or a group of people.   Must have:  Fish noodle (fluffy texture) Beef slices (quite lean but tasty) Frozen tofu (spongy feel)  I knock out one half star because the washroom wasn't as clean as it should be and half star on the decor."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this restaurant. First of all, the people that are rating this will 3 stars or lower try to come into a Chinese Hot Pot joint thinking they're gonna get service like Canoe. Bro this is a Hot Pot joint, know yourself, these people aren't gonna come through to pick up your order unless you tell 'em. In any case, the people complaining about the service are likely the same people that complain at high end restaurants that the spot isn't authentic. This is real Chinese hotpot at its finest, asking servers to send you beef and lamb real quick is 11/10 what you'll experience in China / Hong Kong / wherever you go to get Hot Pot.  When you goto hotpot no one cares about flavour. There's 2 things that you should look out for: 1) Is there unlimited Satay BBQ Sauce.. Oh funny this place has that. 2) Is there beef and lamb.. woah this place has this too  You're here to eat until you hate yourself, not sample delicate tasting platters on a table topped with fine linens from Egyptian cotton fields  Stuff to Order: - Beef - Lamb - Watercress (but honestly this is only for after the meal)"}
{"text":"My new favourite spot for hot pot now. After reading reviews on yelp, I really wanted to try out Kim Tao. Going in I wasn't expecting 5 star status service, yes it was a little annoying trying to wave down the server and being ignored once.. Twice.. Maybe three times.. But I guess that's what is to be expected after reading the Yelp reviews on this place. I must say, the small bit of patience on the service was made worth it when you get to eat the food. I'm reviewing this place for its quality in food. Absolutely delicious; the broths had so much flavour and meat/seafood/veggies were so fresh! I had the satay broth as I heard it was very popular, and the sauces on the table with little garnishments were the cherry on top. Plus, pitchers of either iced tea or plum juice included in your AYCE? Bonus! I ate even beyond what my stomach could handle because it was just too good. I say grow a tolerance to the service and all is worth it.  AYCE Beef option: $18.99 AYCE Beef with Seafood option: $20.99 (Note: the w/ seafood option doesnt provide you with AYCE seafood. You get ONE free round of all their seafood, and if you were to order more of their seafood options it would be an additional charge) After 10pm special: $16.99  When ordering, check off either beef or seafood. Leaving it blank will have them automatically charge you for the seafood price."}
{"text":"A decent hot pot place, they have some interesting options on their base all you can eat menu like baby squid and fish slice (a bamboo tube filled with fish cake which you then slice with a bamboo knife into your pot).  The soup was ok and unfortunately there are not as many sauce options as other hot pot places.  Not too busy, but we got stuck in a corner so we had to wave down the waiter to get our orders in."}
{"text":"This is my go-to hotpot restaurant.    Unlike other newer hotpot restaurants in Markham/RH, this restaurant still has free soup bases available, with unlimited refills of lemon tea and plum juice.    Prices are very reasonable, at $20.99 for adults on a weeknight for the AYCE.  It's recommended you get the seafood price as it's only $2 additional charge and you get a plate of oyster, shrimps, salmon, enoki mushroom, mussels and scallop (the seafood is not unlimited).  There's also cooked food and dessert included in the price.  They did miss a few items, but overall most arrived with not too long of a wait.    Of all the places I've tried, I will continue to return to this one."}
{"text":"One star for the substantial range and variety on their menu for hot potting. They even offer hot pot rice dishes, fried dumplings, and more. We didn't order anything from this \"dry\" (non-soupy hotspot) menu since we weren't sure if it was included in the cost for the late-night \"special\" (at $24.99 on a  Friday evening after 10PM before taxes and 10% automatic gratuities - \"special\" is an overstatement).  We chose the satay and preserved egg/watercress soup base. The satay soup was good, preserved egg was pretty flavourless.  The food was questionably fresh. The thinly sliced red meats were (thankfully) red, and the vegetables were relatively? clean. I thought it was kind of unsanitary that they brought out meat on stacked plates. Like one plate with a thin serving of meat was stacked below another. But maybe that's how it's traditionally presented at hot pot restaurants.  Throughout our meal, we felt a sketchy kinda vibe, and our appetites were constantly getting killed. There was one point in the time during the meal where we heard nail clipping coming from the cash area. Oh my god please no. Hopefully we misheard... either way - we won't be coming again."}
{"text":"Though the ma-la broth was oddly bland, the tomato broth (at no additional cost, unlike the ma-la one) made up for the lost flavour and somehow reminiscent of honey butter chips.   The vegetables and meat seemed fresh enough, and I was willing to forgive the hard shards of beak I found in my squid ball.  What's lowering my score to a 2 is the fact that when removing plates with any uneaten pieces (ie the large bowl of green veggies), the staff doesn't stack the plates on top of each other, but carefully lines them up as to not crush each other. I highly suspect that they're actually putting them back in a larger pile and simply re-serving to the next customer. How do you know I didn't drop anything on the floor or do weird crap with it before putting it back on a plate? Ew, dudes.   I'd recommend to the management that they're better off just serving a slightly smaller portion of greens, then allowing people to order again to avoid wastage.  As for my fellow Yelpers, I'd recommend to go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This used to be a very good place but now it's completely different. The food quality is average and they charge service fee even though the service is very very poor. I don't recommended this to anyone due to the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Kim Tao has been around for so many years - I've yet to find another place as good as Kim Tao.  You will not find any fancy decor here, and yet it is as authentic as chinese hotpot as you can get in all their menu options, broth, sauces, and quality.  There are quite a large number of tables, the restaurant spans to the right and left of the door and also has a back section.    Kim Tao uses the fill-order-form order method which means your order can sometimes get missed.  There's a huge selection of sauces and your choice of Nestea/plum juice which is included in the price. This is what true all-you-can-eat feels like!  Quality wise, they have average quality meat which is redeemed by there being so many options on their menu.  Multiple types of noodles and veggies and the portions are pretty big (despite it being all you can eat) which feels great to have your table full of delicious food.  Definitely my go-to place for hotpot!"}
{"text":"I went there on last tuesay and the guy greeted us with a cold question \" water or tea\". Omg come on i came here to give you business nót ask for money. He never smiled during the time of serving you, oh well i guessed thát he was afraid of losing gold in his mouth as smiling to the customer; he also gave me dirty mushroom. When i asked him aboút tomyum flavour, he just took the menu and pointed his finger to thát. Holy cow i wondered whát the hell service is thát?????? Hey Guys PLEASE DONT COME TO THIS RESTAURANT, THATS NOT THE PLACE TO SPEND MONEY."}
{"text":"Very different place... Went their because my fiancée likes the place...  I am not big on this kind of food. Nice service, very fast. .  Unfortunately,  my fiancée wasn't  too happy with the food this time.  We had beef and veggies... You suppose to cook it yourself.. Mix all the sauces... I think I just don't wasn't to cook my own food at the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Kim Tao is one of my favourite hot spot places. Their food selection is great and their balls are to die for. Especially the cuttlefish balls. I've had the satay soup base and the sweet corn soup base before and it's great for when I want two different spice levels. Their food alone keeps me coming back.   With the ayce, you get a pitcher of plum juice and iced tea. Definitely go with the iced tea, the plum just isn't my cup of tea.   I would've rated them higher, but even with Asian standards their service needs a lot of work. During one of our visits, we were situated in an isolated room and since our help button wasn't working, it was pretty hard to get a server's attention. Plenty of servers would walk past our room and still it was hard. Halfway through our dinner when we flagged a server down, another server pushed him away and in Cantonese he said don't bother with them. We didn't see him again for the rest of the night, but mind you if I did I would've gave him a piece of my mind. After that, a waitress helped us out for the rest of the night and she was great.   The place isn't the cleanest of places, but with Chinese hot pot places what more would you expect.    Definitively the place to go when I'm hungry AF."}
{"text":"Bad services amd attitude even the boss is the same. Food not fresh at all. We reserved the room for big group of people in advance and turn out they said no room available when we get there because the boss's wife needs the room with her friends. Nothing they can do!  Ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. Service could have been a lot better. Food was decent.  Came here for a friends gathering 10 people. Reservations for us a private room at the side. Accommodates 10 -14 nicely. We had to wait around 5 minutes to get seated. The waiting area was packed and very little to no room.  There are no greeters to introduce you to the menu. Drinks came without asking there was an iced tea and a prune juice type drink. We did not check off the seafood platter but they have brought it to us anyway. I think it is $2 extra per person. The seafood was my fav tho. It came with oysters shrimp and some calamari. Dumplings was great too! They have a selection of meats as well as veggies. Originally they said they ran out of the squeeze tofu but later in the night they gave us 2 orders ( not sure where they got it from). The servers who served us were not too friendly. When we asked for items they said \" If I remember \" lol  We also asked to split the bill but ur server talked for around 2 min then said he will give us the bill and you can split it yourself. He could of just said no and that was the end of it lol.  The total came out to around $31 per person, expected for hot pot ayce on a weekend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place, ordered the seafood meal, they will gove you big oysters and the meays are good too, nothing fancy but you will enjoy for sure, their broth are pretty good and tasty, for the price, this is the most affordable ayce hot pot with good service and the best part is, their washroom is clean!"}
{"text":"We came here for new year's eve dinner after we lost our reservations at a seafood restaurant.  We came here on a recommendation because I haven't had good hot pot in a long time. It was also bitterly cold last night so hot pot was actually a great idea.  Firstly the waiters are pretty non responsive but I already expected that. They are overworked a bit so you just have to be a bit patient and holler a couple, three...ok maybe four times to get their attention.  Since we came on nye, they charged us the weekend price which is fine. A 2 dollar extra we got the seafood as well which included oysters, muscles, scallops, salmon, mushrooms....One piece each.  Not bad.  The beef, lamb and pork slices were quite fresh. The homemade squid and meat balls were very good. The dumplings and wontons were the usual.  I really liked all the different sauces you can order for dipping.  Also the lemon tea drink was tasty.  All in all it was very good ayce hot pot...you just have to learn to be patient with the wait staff which could get some people annoyed.  2 stars for the wait staff. 4 stars for the food."}
{"text":"The one thing I like about this place is that there's a lot of options to make your dipping sauce just right. This restaurant isn't memorable though."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday 10pm after a movie,   There's nothing much to say except the fact the place looks like a mess. There are used chopsticks laying underneath the table,crumpled napkins and the cups are foggy looking and sticky.   The service was OK..   The food was nothing special, we ordered the seafood platter that came with oysters, scallops, shrimps, mussels,enoki mushroom and 2 thin slices of salmon that dissapeared in the broth.  The good thing is they have unlimited free ice tea or plum juice.   The price of  it came to $52 for 2 .. Which was kind of worth it??  They also add service charge to it so don't need to give extra tips !     *note: some things may not be fresh, because we ended up having a stomach ache afterwards*"}
{"text":"Cameback this Thursday from a 3 day/2 night Blue Mountain boarding trip. My girlfriend and I were craving hot pot and we always think of this place.  Why?!?!  They make their own homemade cuttlefish, beef, pork, and fish balls! Cuttlefish ball is our favourite (texture is delicious). Hand cut beef sliced to perfection with just enough fat....Mmmm. Wine chicken marinated just right.   We added their Malay Soup for additional $4.00, 2 Sing Tao Beer, and seafood top up. It came to $60.00 for two with service charge included.  If you put aside their quality of service...this would be my 5 star AYCE hot pot!"}
{"text":"That was one of my favorite Hot Pot place. But this time it disppointed me as the beef balls were not fresh."}
{"text":"I only ever have hot pot when I'm visiting home, so my family and I piled into the car during my last trip back and made our way to Kim Tao. We were there early, at around 6:30 so there weren't that many people yet in their extended restaurant area. But by about 7 the place had filled up with lots of people, and my parents commented that they were probably the oldest people there.  The food was a steal for 100 for 5 of us on a Monday night. They were advertising hand-sliced beef, which I honestly didn't think was worth all the hype (the meat comes out thicker, so it's a little more rough), but the fresh meat balls and fish balls were fantastic. I liked that they also had a good assortment of vegetables, and they had a fish paste noodle that you can squeeze yourself. There are also four basic soup bases you can choose from, and the five of us got to use two burners so we had a lot of food going at once. Plus a good selection of actual desserts (and not red bean soup!), and all you can drink ice tea or plum juice! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were planning to go to the newly opened Chongqing Liuyishou (where 100 deg used to be). Since they had an event, my friends decided to come here. My last experience was terrible. This time was actually pretty good.  The highlights were the baby octupus and the honey comb tripe. Not many places have those. The handmade beef balls were decent too. Beef slices were a bit too fat, but the lamb slices were good.  Services were alright, but nothing spectacular. Food came rather quick. When ordering, they sort of just gave portions that reflected your party size rather than whatever number you put down.  All you can drink ice tea weren't that great. Tastes like self mixed and a bit off.  Dessert was mango sago. Pretty good.  The beef ayce (not seafood) weekend dinner came to about 29 dollars a person.  7/10 for quality of food, 6/10 for service, 6/10 for value, 7/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"This is the worse place I've been too. They are extremely rude. When ordering food, they don't bring majority of it. They ignore tables and when you get their attention, they contintue to walj away as if they dont see you. They over charge you. I was there tonight after 10 and I ask them for the after 10 special but they charged me for the seafood meal which is $33 a person includung tax and service charge. I've seen that the late night special is around $18.99 to $20.99. SUCH A SCAM!!! Trying to get a answer from them about the bill is impossible, they pretend they dont understand you. Never going there again. Again such a scam of a place. I dont know how they are still open. Someone should shut them down as soon as possible before they scam more people."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night with my large buffet loving family.  We had made a reservation for an early dinner at 6pm so didn't have a problem securing our table.  Most of our group ordered the seafood.  The seafood is a couple of dollars more for a plate of seafood.  Seafood isn't all you can eat.  The seafood dish comes with 1 oyster, 1 mussel, 2 shrimps, 2 scallops and some enoki mushroom per person.  The oyster was fresh, nice and plump!  Worth the extra $2 in my opinion. All the food was pretty fresh and I liked that the plum juice or lemon tea was included.  I also liked that they offered different soup bases at no extra charge like the satay.  I deducted a star for the slow service.  We found that our order didn't always come and we had to follow up and re order items.  They were also so busy it was difficult to flag someone down.    Another positive is that the restaurant felt really well ventilated so it didn't get too congested with hot pot fumes.  Will try to return on a weeknight when it's not  as busy."}
{"text":"I been here before but this my first time writing a review...the service was good out waiter was helpful always checking up on us and the food was decent"}
{"text":"Came here again last night, but tried some different things, thanks to Wayne's ability to read Chinese and his experience with hot pot.  The handmade cuttlefish and fish fish balls were phenomenal. I normally dislike fish ball, but these ones were AMAZING. Just make sure they're cooked (floating on the top, and then some).  Also we had the hand cut beef, which is thicker than the regular beef they have, takes longer to cook and is incredibly tender and delicious!  The desserts are also very  good. The mango tapioca is cold, and would be great in the summer, but all of us really enjoyed the taro tapioca, which is hot and rich."}
{"text":"Definitely our go-to restaurant for hotpot! One of the few ones left around town that has HK style hotpot (ie. Not drenched in spicy oils) The restaurant is very spacious with private rooms each equipped with its own TV for larger groups. Don't expect spectacular service though. Lots of condiments for those sauce lovers!"}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner after a game at World Bowl (right across the street - great pairing for a night out with friends or family). After 10PM the price for regular hotpot goes down by $5 to $16.99 per person...pretty standard for AYCE. After iCook took away their late-night special, I decided to give this one a try.  Food selection was also about standard, though if you want seafood options like salmon slices, those are extra and not included. You get a pitcher of plum juice or lemon tea with the purchase of AYCE. If you try to order more than one of something like noodles or beef and you don't have a large group, expect them to bring you half of what you order.  The beef balls/fish balls are handmade and are actually pretty good, but don't cook the meat slices too long - they are extremely thin and can get overcooked/tough really fast. For extended meals, expect to write multiple orders down of the same thing.  Most clean appearance and quiet. Service is slow and sometimes unresponsive - but that is expected at Chinese restaurants especially in the night. Wasn't too populated so got seated right away.  Overall: Pretty decent for standard AYCE. Would come here again after a game of bowling at World Bowl."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite hotpot place but I think over the years, the soup and service has gone even further down.  Flagging down the staff is enough to try your patience and even your manners - as they walk away before you're even done speaking, forget your orders and bark at you for placing an order. It's no wonder service is automatically charged as even a nonexistent penny may even be too much for these folks. While the product is mediocre at best, they still have the widest selection for AYCE with some cooked food also available for ordering. Not sure if I ever want to return as the level of service is just so intolerable."}
{"text":"So , i saw this place on my friends snapchat , & im always more than down to try new and cool looking places  & also first time trying hot pot   LOVED IT. Satisfied.   The waitor looked confused and attitudey  at the beginning, cause i dont think he understood me when i said its our first time, But then he realized and he started helping us with everything, and actually made a special sauce for us to try , which was so good  He was so nice   Not a lovely smell when you first walk in but Overall a good experience   Came out to $28 AYCE dinner"}
{"text":"If I were to rate on just the food, I would have given it a solid 3. The spicy soup was flavourful and the variety of meats I was able to try seemed like standard hot pot food. They also serve cold lemon tea and prune juice at no extra charge.   However, given the amount of times my friends and I have been to this restaurant, were were only able to get a selected range of food...not because we didn't want to order it, but because the order never came after multiple follow ups. The nice thing about this restaurant is that they give you order papers so you can mark want you want, and the staff will bring them to you. But, if you try to order a bunch of things at once, you will only get around half the food you've ordered. When you ask the staff where the rest of the food is, they will tell you they will bring it, but will often forget about you, even if the restaurant is practically empty. The service button they have is essentially useless because they never respond when we click it. The owner/manager always look disgruntled, and sounds bothered when we order food.   I went a few times, hoping that the service will improve. Sufficed to say, I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite hotpot place! I love the satay broth and they have so many options for sauces. The service is pretty good too, the only downside is that sometimes they get your order wrong but that's okay because they are always quick to fix it. Also the lemon iced tea is really good."}
{"text":"My favourite hot pot place of all times!  We have been going here for about 5 years and this place never disappoints.  Not sure why some reviewers are saying poor service but perhaps they could comment and elaborate further?  We have always had impeccable service here, every single time and let me tell you I can't even count how many times I came here during my 9 months pregnancy cravings here almost every night.  I love all the condiments from this place, you can refer to my photo for the crazy mixing of sauces I love to throw into the mix; garlic, ginger, hoisin sauce, satay sauce, green onion, parsley, red onions, chilli pepper.  A few must orders for me here are their cuttlefish balls, fish balls, tripes, baby squid, fried bean curd balls (my absolute favourite), nappa, Chinese lettuce, udon.  I always get the satay soup base and the parsley and thousand year old egg.  The one advice when coming here is to don't wear your fancy clothes as you will smell fishy after dining here.  The price is very affordable especially comparing to other AYCE hot pots but this place is better because they offer a lot more condiments than most other places."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for hotpot in Markham but after the last visit, I don't think I will go back.  I made a reservation for 8 people at 7:30 on Sat night. Table wasn't ready at arrival. and we didn't get to sit down until 9:00. This is ridiculous. Once we place our order, it took them 20 min to bring out the pot and broth.   First round didn't come out until almost 9:40. We could of waited and gotten Sui Yeh. We were done first round in 10 min because we were soo hungry order second round and that took like another 25 min. I think either they don't have enough food or need to hire more workers.  Overall the food was still good but the Service really suck. Because of all customer complain the server were all in very bad mood and even witness one server slam a tray to the ground.  Unless they get their act together and hire better worker. I will definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  Sighh....has it been that long since I last ate here?  What the f*** happened?  Under old management this place used to be the 2nd best hotpot joint in richmond hill behind hipot (which perma-closed recently for reasons unknown 'sniffle* sniffle*').  As a matter of fact, these guys would definitely be getting 4 stars from me if it was still under old management  The variety of sauce and food as well as the broths are actually very good here (plenty of condiments).  HOWEVER, depending what items you order, you may not receive fresh stuff.  My mom has an iron stomach and she puked after consuming some of the fish cakes and tofu.  Possible cutting of food standards by new management?  The service is what REALLY irks me.  The new owner (and also some of the waiters) have NO business serving customers.  Jesus Christ.  After reading some of my fellow yelpers reviews I see a lot of ppl agreeing with me about this new owner and said staff.  He gives you attitude as you are being seated.  Seriously, I don't even put THAT much emphasis on service when I rate a restaurant but these guys bark at you if you even ask questions about the menu and act like they hate life!  Is it too much to smile or answer questions politely when customers ask about stuff?  Rude establishments are a dime a dozen but this new staff really takes the cake and FORCED my hand at making a review to blast them.  tl;dr,  FOOD - 3.5/5   SERVICE - 0/5"}
{"text":"OG of hot pot scene!  The environment feels dated and grimy, but Kim Tao has to be doing something right to stay in business for decades.  Firstly it price right. Not overly expensive and it comes with lots of extras, compared to other hot pot places in the area.  The severs look tired, but not rude. And they are pretty prompt in clearing the table and refilling whatever you need.  I'll be back... just not too often to avoid gaining some serious weight."}
{"text":"This place has a feel of been in HK. Once I walk In it feel so humid. The table is sticky and it feels uncomfortable. The food is pretty good. Few things never shows it. Maybe they didn't have it or they didn't want to give you any. Coupe waiter has a attitude problem. The other was more friendly. They only allow to give you one dessert. I don't see the big deal of the dessert since it's made by a large pot. Overall it is a very average place. I probably go again but not purposely."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 4. The booths are just the right size and they gave us an extra table as an extension for the massive amount of food we ordered.  Basically hot pot if you don't know is sort of like  chinese fondue.   You are given a big bowl of broth of your choice and given a plethora of meats, fish, greens, sauces and spices.  A great way to share with friends, just remember to use 2 sets of chop sticks! 1 for the bowl and 1 for your mouth!"}
{"text":"Ordered hot pot here for some beef slices, udon noodles, veggies, and such. There aren't utensils to help with putting in the meat and noodles, so I just used the scoop and some chopsticks. Every other hot pot restaurant I've been to provides it.  Out of my group of 7, I was the only one to get a bowl of rice. When I asked for a refill, I was told that they had limited rice only for the staff and it was their lunch so they had no steamed rice available. But it's weird because I was able to order the beef fried rice....? What kind of hot pot place doesn't have any steamed rice available? Does that mean they used old rice to cook the fried rice?  Service was completely rude and possibly the worst I've ever experienced. Probably hates his job.   The only reason this place isn't getting one star is because the food is actually decent. However, this place doesn't look clean at all and one would assume that they probably don't follow health standards."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit at Kim Tao. Though hotpot isn't my favourite thing to eat, it's my best friend's so he brought me to Kim Tao for his own cravings.   First off, I looooooved how they give you lemon iced tea as a drink with no extra charge instead of being cold jasmine or oolong tea.   There was a huge selection of broths and we ended up getting miso and tom yum which were an extra $4 each. You were also able to choose what you want for sauces for no extra charge which is great because a lot of hotpot places are starting to charge for sauces, ridiculous.   The tom yum was spicy though it could've been a little more sour, the miso tasted just like miso soup (as it should) and there was huge piece of seaweed in the broth which made it even better.   The service is great and I appreciated having a button at my table so that it's easier to call for service.   This place comes with free dessert too! Taro Sago, Mango Sago, and Sweet Potato.   Will be coming back to here! Also I would like to add that Kim Tao is open until 2AM even on weekdays."}
{"text":"Useful or Useless reviews.  It's not determined by medium as much but by the users that feed input into them be it on the technological web or traditional word-of-mouth.  It is also by the end-users that consume the input...  Reviews, just like Meals are up to the end-user to determine the value with-in.  The end-user be it review-readers or meal-eaters always have a CHOICE to accept or refuse what they are offered.  It's been such a long time since last I visited Kim Tao.  The changes notably the expansion opening up 30% more real-estate. Secondly, if I remember correctly they have made updates. (Entrance way, Lcd TV, etc...)  It looks to me that newcomer local Hot Pots and updates from existing Hot Pots has enforced mandatory change to the face of Kim Tao to stay battle-ready.  Looking at prior reviews now. It's amazing how some of those events happened to our Flaming Lips(UYE) group as well -= Useful  =-.  Full automatic top-up of Iced Tea/Plum Juice Pitchers, so much we couldn't finish. Also we were seated booth-sitting(A5) in the new area which seems to have less ability for service-contact and require a bit of pro-activeness for request.  Beef(Non-seafood) Unlimited Food/Drink($15.99)(Fri/Sat/Sun +$2.00)   Hand-sliced Beef is nice to see as it's normally a home-made ingredient. Handmade Cuttlefish Balls are good -= Useful =-,always my favourite anywhere while the Handmade Balls here seemed bigger in circumference than other places needing more time/patience than the cooked ones. My mistake Eric, it's the cooked Balls that are ready when floating -=Useless me =-.   Overall, ingredients are good and selection usual as with most Hot Pot dining nowadays. The use of side-tables to allow more table space is a nice touch giving more space instead of elbow-to-elbow of raw food always getting on clothes/hands due to lack of space.   Hot Taro Tapioca Dessert was good not overly sweet and same goes for Cold Mango Tapioca -= Useful =- so save room for Dessert.  Helped dissipate some of the manageable spiciness from Szechuan Ma La Soup(+$4.00) containing good amount of Dried Chilis and Szechuan Peppercorn(numb)."}
{"text":"I was here for a group dinner with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. This was my first time at this hot pot restaurant. The restaurant inside is big and there are individual rooms that you can book for larger groups. You get ice tea and plum juice for drinks. They also have different soup base that you can pick from too - the selection of soup base was good, quite a few choices to choose from. It is an all you can eat hot pot place. In terms of food, there were a lot to choose from on their menu. However, although they had a good choice of soup base, I thought the flavors were just too weak. For instance our side of the table order the fish head soup base, I didn't really taste the fish head in the soup. The service is not great, but for a place like this, I wasn't expecting much service to be honest. The servers were nice but sarcastic. There were a few times that I or one of my friends had to go up front to ask for service - although to keep in mind we had a large group and was placed in one of the rooms that was really far in one of the wings of the restaurant. I seriously think they should have a bell, like the ones they normally have in Korean restaurants. Overall, this place not bad for all you can eat hot pot."}
{"text":"It's an all you can eat hot pot place. For food everything is really fresh and delicious. But for the service probably not so good. We ordered plum juice and they gave us lemon tea instead. So we were like OK. Cause everyone will make some mistakes. We also ordered fish paste with eggplant but it never came until we asked for it. Plus the veggie we ordered it never came as well until we asked the staff and he said we do not have it for today. We had to order another type of veggie which is...hmm fine. But my question is can you just tell us first before we place the order?   Well anyways, once again the food is not too bad but the service just no so organized that's why I only give three stars."}
{"text":"One of the best hot pot restaurant in Toronto.  They make the best beef balls in any hot pot restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"My favorite place for hotpot!! Make a reservation if you go on the weekends as this place is packed full of people during the winter months and there is good reason for it. The food is fresh and there is a large variety at a reasonable price. However, something to keep in mind is that service could be slow during peak hours but the food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I went there this Wednesday and it charges a weekend price. Okay, the fish cake and vege i ordered 2 times and never come! Still okay since i liked this place very much, BUT! I went home and get stomach sick for 2 days! OMFG thats totally not ok! Im too nice not to sue them! Not coming back ever again!"}
{"text":"Not many places have Tom Yum flavor. Kim Tao has really great lemon tea. The service isn't bad. Definitely recommend trying the dessert."}
{"text":"I never eat hot pot and it definitely would not be my first choice when choosing something to eat but a friend suggested it, so alas, here we are. I made sure to read some reviews before coming so I knew what to expect.  The food was pretty good and definitely enough to keep you full. For a party of 8, they brought us two jugs of drinks: one iced tea and one plum juice. They were really good about refilling the jugs. Service wasn't too slow either considering it was quite packed on a Saturday night (definitely did not expect that so good thing we made a reservation beforehand). They actually have a lot of rooms that you can't see in the main area so they can accommodate quite a lot of people. However, there was one server that looked super angry all the time and he looked like he wanted to stab someone every time he came over. I really think it was just him and not us, because we are not a demanding group. They also have a $5 fee to bring your own alcohol, which isn't bad at all as other places charge a lot more. For dessert, definitely get the warm taro sago; it's a lot better than the cold mango sago, which tasted like artificial mangoes. The warm sweet potato soup wasn't too bad either.  3.5/5 stars! I can't say I'd come back though unless someone made me. For the price (we each paid around $40 for the added seafood option), frankly I'd rather go to an AYCE sushi place or literally anywhere else, because hot pot is not my fave. BUT if you like hot pot or want to try it, this place is pretty solid."}
{"text":"Great spread including brothes and sauces.  Great service all around and try the desserts they are yummy."}
{"text":"This is probably my go to hot pot... it's a shame it's so far! Was here this past Saturday and left super satisfied!  The Tom yum soup did need a bit more flavour but nothing that fish sauce couldn't fix!  Food came super fast many great selections!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the sticky rice here and if I could rate the entire experience based on that one dish, it would be a solid 4 stars. However, since it is a hot pot place, I had to hold myself back from filling up on the sticky rice and the rice pot with Chinese sausages.  The rest of the choices for hot pot are average. They offer hand made beef, pork, and cuttlefish balls but I find I actually prefer the consistency of frozen ones. The service is rather slow and parts of my order were forgotten on several occasions."}
{"text":"I love hot pot, and I love AYCE style.. I was bound to like this place at least a little bit. I came here for an early dinner with my family for one of our last meals in Toronto. The food was pretty good, and there was a pretty decent selection of food and sauces available. I enjoyed the thinly sliced beef and lamb, but I felt like the meat quality was very average. I enjoyed most of the fish balls and meat balls as well, but I did feel like the beef ball was a little unusual.. Some of the insides of the beef balls remained slightly red no matter how long I cooked it, and I couldn't figure out why that was happening. I ate it anyway and didn't die, so I guess that turned out okay. The dumplings were great, but they took a very long time to cook because they were given to us frozen. The oysters that were provided on the half shell were MASSIVE. They tasted alright, but I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of cooked oysters in general. I didn't like their fish paste at all because there was way too much cilantro in it. The cilantro in it was completely overpowering to me, but I know some people actually like cilantro in their fish paste.. matter of preference I suppose. The beef tripe was TERRIBLE and by far the worst item we received. I usually love the texture of beef tripe when it's soaked in soup (soft and slippery exterior with a slightly chewy interior), but the beef tripe here actually hardened a little bit in the soup. It was absurdly chewy and basically inedible.. Something was definitely wrong with that beef tripe. We were also given a mango tapioca dessert on the house at the end of the meal. It was delicious and refreshing, and I felt that it was an excellent way to end our dinner. All of the other items we received during our meal were essentially what I expected, so I don't have much to write about for those items.   The service here was straightforward and reasonably fast, but the waiter did miss a few of our items more than once. When we informed him of the mistakes, he was able to fix it rather quickly. I imagine the service wouldn't have been this fast if we arrived during the busier dinner hours. The price for the AYCE hot pot dinner was very worth it, and I'm jealous that there aren't AYCE hot pot restaurants in my area like this place. Unfortunately for me, most of the hot pot restaurants near me are a la carte style, so the prices add up really fast for someone with a large appetite. I would be willing to come here again, but I would probably research the other AYCE hot pot restaurants in the area before returning. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Decent hot pot, ayce and unlimited plum drink and ice tea. Fairly fresh for most food. Service is not the best but that's what you get when you go for hot pot. Price is continuing to increase though every year which is a bummer."}
{"text":"Since Hipot closed it's doors, this was the next closest thing we could find!! They were pretty packed on a Wednesday evening but I really don't think that should be an excuse for super poor service.   We called in advance to ask how much it was for a child (age 3.5 yrs old) They told us $4.99, we were ok with that price. As we arrived, we advised it was 6 adults and 1 child. The server/waiter told us it would be $12.99 for the child instead. We were like, we called and was initially advised $4.99. The waiter was being rude and said \"ok fine, whatever he told you\"  Really? get your pricing together people. The child was so young, she barely even ate anything.   When we ordered food according to the \"choose and pick\" list, we explicitly put 3x of EACH of the veggies but we ended up getting only 1x of EACH veggie. We had to continuously wave our hand to get some sort of attention (minus 2 stars) from our waiter/server, every time we got \"coming, coming\" but they always forgot about us.   They ended up giving us some type of \"hot bowl rice\" which we didn't even check off. Basically, we got stuff we didn't order and didn't get stuff we ordered. What was the point of that again? (minus 1 star)  The owner/boss was the worse when it comes to service. I really don't know how he gets business with that type of attitude and service.  The only reason, I believe they are surviving, it's because HiPot and 100 degrees both closed down. Without competition, everything goes downhill and they still get business.  All in all, don't want to come back. The reason I will come back is probably peer pressure and I have nothing else to eat except for here. So you get the picture!"}
{"text":"Very expensive  - with what they serve you. No reason to come back. Service - cannot find your server Food - cheap quality Do not waste your time"}
{"text":"Service - terrible service, on a long weekend dinner time there's only 2waiter/waitress and the owner working. We had to wait over 15mins until we got to order, then another 15mins for food to come. They always mess up what we ordered, giving us food that we never ordered and forgetting to give us food that we ordered.  Food - wide select, love the ox tongue and lamb. Drinks are also included as well as all sauces. Seafood are not worth it, only 2shrimp, 1oyster, 1 scallop, 1 small piece of salmon per person.  Price - it's reasonable, after 9pm would be a better deal since you're getting the same full selection for a way cheaper price.  I always come even though bad service but food is  better compared to other stores in Toronto."}
{"text":"They add tips to the bill! Not cool! We had the seafood platter, 23 something, and the bill for each one was 30 something. My friend put in tips then realize thet already took the liberty to put in tips themselves. I would not have giving them that much tips. I didnt get the services i expected.  The service was horrible, they really didnt want to be there or they didnt want us to be there.   It was like quater full on a saturday night, they forgot to give us the meat, and didnt give us the meat balls we ordered. And the fish too...  The lamb and the beef was not good, thick and didnt taste good. The satay sauce was not good either.   Overall, BAD!   I dont know how they got such a good ratings and reviews. Mslaybe they wrote it themselves..."}
{"text":"Kim Tao, worth the drive to Markham! Or Richmond Hill? Or wherever the hell we were!  $16 plus tax for AYCE hot pot. I've never had Chinese hotpot before, but I was totally impressed. The menu had LOTS of options. About 10 different broths (you get to pick 2), 25-30 meat and dumplings selections and another 10-15 vegetables. There were some premium meats and seafood items that cost extra.  We chose satay broth and a \"Mala Spicy\" one which was INCREDIBLY spicy. Super good.   The restaurant is huge. By the time we left (8:30pm or so on a Thursday), it was nearly a full house. No whiteys (except for our table!) It was a bit slow getting the bill and paying, but we weren't in a hurry so no big deal.  What a feast. We need this shit downtown!"}
{"text":"I was taken here twice by some friends and I would definitely go over and over again.  I love hot pot and this place satisfies all cravings perfectly.  Their broth is delicious and have a lot of varieties. The food came out promptly and they were very quick with anything else that we needed.  The best part is all you can eat!"}
{"text":"How many good hotpot places are left nowadays? Despite the not-so-great service at times and average decor, I think Kim Tao is a fairly solid hot pot, with good soup base, variety of condiments, food (cuttle fish ball is v good!), drinks (sour plum and lemon tea!), and cooked foods such as claypot rice, fried glutinous rice, desserts and some fried side dishes."}
{"text":"After 100 degrees closed I was and still am, looking for an alternative hot pot restaurant. I come here maybe once a year and it's gotten a bit better, but still isn't good. The soup bases they have are ok, the quality of meat is better then Hipot or Made in China but the service is bad.  The place is too big for the number of wait staff and they put extra side tables out so it can accommodate the extra food, but it makes it hard for people to walk back and forth and thereby making the service slow. I re-ordered beef and lamb so many times because they kept loosing the paper and they got frustrated with us and didn't refill our hot pot broth or tea.  We pretty much just wanted to eat the beef or lamb and leave. However between every time we ordered we would wait 15 mins to see if the food would come and it wouldn't (4 times) so I eventually told the server, he seemed angry that I had asked him to follow up with the orders and I explained I did not want to double order but he was already annoyed at us by then, so as soon as it came, we ate it, asked for the bill and left.   Oh yeah, they added an extra 10% service charge to our bill (which I haven't seen here before- but pretty sure it was because they were annoyed with us [party of 3 people]). I know many Chinese restaurants don't have good service but I didn't think the servers would be rude let alone MIA most of the time. I'm still searching for my go-to hot pot place."}
{"text":"Fairly solid hot pot place. The main reason why I come here is that I feel like I get my bang for my buck. Honestly, some hot pot places are totally not worth it even though they may be all you can eat. Kim Tao is worth it because their seafood meal price is on par with many regular meal prices of other places. You get a huge oyster, a scallop, two shrimps, two types of fish and a mussel. It might not sound like a lot but when you're going out to eat seafood, you'll find that the cost is a lot more.   In addition to your seafood meal which you should also get (unless you don't like seafood, but be cool and offer the seafood to your seafood loving friends ;D), there's a wide range of condiments you can order (they have the basics premade and put on your table, who knows how long that's been there and what has been flying around in them, just saying), a respectable variety of food you can get and an ok selection of soups. I've never ordered the additional fee soups so I can't say for those. I've had chicken stock and satay (also when they refill your pot they use water not chicken stock).   Their fish paste is good and fun to dispense, their fish noodles on the other hand, although fun to dispense, not so fun to eat. They also have side orders like hot pot rice and fried appetizers such as chicken wings, wontons, dumplings and a few other interesting (seasonal?) choices.   I only come here for my hot pot now because of the price. Service is.. you take what you can get. It was a little difficult to get the servers attention and even though we pressed the button to call for a server, sometimes they might not come. I mean as long as they bring our food then I am alright. Hotpot takes time to cook and eat, so if you are eager to have your second order in, have the sheet ready and throw them the order as soon as you see them whizzing by."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and really enjoyed the selection of ingredients, the service and the value. You are able to select the soup base you would like, your dipping sauces and because we selected the seafood option - we got a platter of oysters, scallops, fish and mussels. You could order more if you would like for an additional $3 per peice. The atmosphere is a bit dated compared to the newer places but the food and service made up for it. I was even surprised that their air conditioning was cool enough when we entered which made the dining experience great. I've been to other restaurants where their ventilation was poor and it made me feel like I was dining in a sauna. Their lemon tea drink also reminded me of the ones in the vitasoy tetra packs and dinner also comes with dessert. We had their mango sago. All in all, a great hot pot place to check out!"}
{"text":"I only came here because 100 degrees closed down and I needed my hot pot fix. My bf and I were seated all the way at the back of the restaurant where the servers would barely walk over to. Every time we needed to order more meat we had to wave like crazy for someone to notice us, and when they did they would keep forgetting our order. That was very annoying. The meat was alright except for the lamb which tasted weird, and the beef and squid balls weren't good either. Overall, the place didn't look so clean, service was poor, and the food was so-so."}
{"text":"very busy restaurant, cuz it's one of the best all you can eat hotpot in town!  very very fresh meats~ love their beef balls~!!"}
{"text":"OH MAN. I have never been this full in my life. Got both the ice tea and prune juice. Ordered every meat possible (no seafood!) and was beyond stuffed. Hot pot rice was decent. Service was adequate. Dont come here expecting 5 star service or even 3 star service. LOL. Its all about that broth and raw goodies. The meat quality is above average and the broth is solid. I recommend this old historic hot pot. Been going here for years. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"This is one of the most reasonably priced hotpot in the GTA ($20.99 on weekdays + $2 additional on weekends) and that is why I consistently find myself returning here. For the price, you get a large jug of ice tea/plum juice w/ unlimited refills and a few cooked dishes such as rice pots. What really places Kim Tao over the edge are the variety of soup bases that are included (Ex. Satay, Tomato, Preserved Egg...etc.). Overall, the food is decent quality and comes out quickly.   In terms of service, it really depends which waiter serves you (some are better than others). But a common trend I find is that they'll forget 1-2 items that we request.   TIPS:  - They already applied a service charge on your bill   - Deserts aren't on the menu, you have to request for it; They have mango sago and red bean soup - If you want the AYCE Beef option, make sure you check it off on the paper or they'll charge you the seafood price.  - Sit near the center of the restaurant, as it's easier to get someone's attention  - FREE wifi"}
{"text":"True rating 4 stars.  Because it is pretty much the only one that fits my criteria of a Chinese hot pot restaurant, 4.5 stars from me.  Frankly, I have no choice but to be a fan because, to the best of my knowledge, Kim Tao is one of the only two hot pot restaurants that operates using the formula of 1) under $30 + 2) free broth + 3) AYCE + 4) many non-spicy broth options + 5) no time limit in the Markham/Richmond Hill area.  The other one is Made in China, but I don't like that one.  Pro:  Quite a few free broth choices, including spicy satay (there are spicier ones for a fee) Have beef or seafood hot pot options to choose from (I suggest you choose beef hot pot) Outstanding meat balls and fish balls Fish noodle (you must order this) Some cooked food and appetizers are availabe for free (see posters on wall) Many sauces and spices available to mix your own sauce. Free WiFi Really good prices for weekdays 15% off for senior age 65 or older   Con:  Decor is dated (at this price point and this volume and quality of food, I don't care) The ambience (at this price point and this volume and quality of food, I don't care)  We visited on last Sunday.  The food selections were vast.  There were sufficient seafood choices available to the beef hot pot option.  The quality of all the meat and vegetable items were solid.  There were unusual items that I happened to like (pork blood, beef tripe).  All types of meat we ordered was fresh.  All the seafood items available to beef hot pot (we ordered all) were fresh.  Services was fast and effective, though more matter of fact instead of courteous.  As far as Chinese AYCE hot pot restaurants in Markham/Richmond Hill area, I can't think of another one that suits me better (i.e. non spicy, free broth and AYCE)."}
{"text":"This place is usually very busy and as a result, getting the staff's attention is pretty hard. If you expect class A service, I would recommend you come here because they won't be as attentive as they would like to. I also feel this place is badly ventilated as the windows get all fogged up and generally feels stuffy.   Service aside, food is great! Can't complain as they do have a wide range of selection to choose from. I especially love their corn! Also comes with free drinks (lemon tea or plum drink) and free desserts too! It's fairly reasonably priced so what more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Not bad! First off we have had a bad experience where places will only allow you to get one or two sauces or else you have to pay a dollar for each. I'm looking at you Emperor Hot Pot! Anyways, this place allows you to order and ask for more as needed WITHOUT extra payment. Which is necessary because I love to mix like 4 different sauces to dip my meats in.  Secondly, the seafood was actually pretty good. Cuttlefish balls were great, so was the actual cuttlefish.  Meat could've been better, it wasn't bad but wasn't like OMG at the same time. But for the price it was pretty good. For all those that are saying the service sucks. Yes it does somewhat but me and my boyfriend (him being Cantonese), expect nothing but. The service at an all you can eat Chinese owned establishment is just not going to be the whole \" HI is everything okay so far?\" Service you want. Just not going to happen.   BE AWARE TIP IS INCLUDED. Don't do what my boyfriend did and not follow instructions LOL"}
{"text":"A decent hot pot place.  I came here with a few other friends and it was a great meal overall.  They have quite a large selection of food here compared to some other hot pot restaurants.  The quality of the food is reasonable for its price (not the best meat, but at least it's fresh).  I find that the restaurant isn't as clean as some of the newer hotpot restaurants, but that might just be the décor that gives me that feeling. The service is mediocre here and may take a bit more time to get service on weekends when its busy. If you are craving hotpot and want variety give this restaurant a chance."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple hotpot uptown and downtown.  This place is still my go to place.  I wish yelp seperated service vs food in ratings.  The food here is high in quality.  The soup base Tom yum is my go to.  I solely base my ratings on the food and not the service.  You can't expect much from Asian places.  This place is not as modern as other places but the food beats all other places that look nice hands down.  Most hotpot places I call generic pot as they use the same frozen foods usually bought as where this place majority of the items are cut fresh like the beef.  One way to see if the place is cutting corners is the luncheon meat.  If they use real spam it's quality.  If it some other luncheon meat that tastes like rubber I'm pretty sure they're cutting corners elsewhere as well.  You also can't beat the late night special after 10pm."}
{"text":"Kam toa is one of of the first, if not the first hot pot place in Richmond Hill. There are a number of newer places that offer variations, but kam toa will always be the original HK style hot pot place. Its been around since at least the mid 90's, which makes it about 20+ years old actually. The original owner is still here, and funny enough he always seems to recognize me when I come in. Not sure if that's a good thing or not. Please be warned that the owner also pretty much has a permanent scowl on his face. Not that hes angry, or trying to be rude or anything but I just think of it as him being all business. I actually think its a bit funny  The service here is not the best, but definitely not the worse. Their hot pot broths are quite decent and standard fare (satay, clear broth etc) and they have a large variety of hot pot ingredients to choose from on a sheet of paper that you check off. They have two main styles of hot pot, either beef or seafood so make sure you check off which one you want or they default you to seafood.  One awesome thing about kam toa is the variety of condiments they give you. I believe between my other half and myself we ordered 13 condiments to make up your own personal sauce mix.  They also have a number of TV's through out the restaurant, and they seem to usually either play some HK stuff, or if there is a basketball game on or another major sporting event they turn that on too. Whether your a couple or a larger group, everyone at least gets a booth to sit at. For much larger groups (6+) you may get your own small room.  I wouldnt say its fantastic service, food or decor. It also isnt the latest and greatest instagram-worthy place. But just the sum of all its parts put together make this place a definite place to visit if you really crave HK style, no nonsense hot pot."}
{"text":"I am here tonight for the 10pm late night special ($14.99).  They also have Beef menu for $16.99 and Seafood menu for $18.99.  The food selection here is wonderful.  Much bigger than most hot pot places.  It does not have my favourite - quail eggs, but includes unlimited drinks (plum juice, ice tea) and rice pot (spare rib, sticky rice, pork patty on rice).  They also have handmade beef/pork/fish balls.  The soup base is the usual with optional specialty soup base for extra $$.  The service is virtually non-existant.  Not sure if it is because it's after 10pm or maybe because our table is hidden from view.  Great place to try if you're looking for a large selection of hot pot menu items.  Will return with a bigger crowd to try out the rest of the items."}
{"text":"Hot pot was pretty good. 10% gratuity is included. Service was good, although it was not very busy. The spicy broth was not too spicy which was good."}
{"text":"3.5/5  This is probably the only hot pot place in Richmond Hill that's been open for several years, and it's not surprising considering they are open late (until 3am), their food quality is quite good, and their prices are relatively reasonable.  You will be given the option of seafood or beef meal. I went with beef, as the seafood really only consisted of mussel and salmon (and a few others which I forgot), which really aren't high in the seafood I enjoy. I also went with satay broth on the left and clear broth on the right (as you'd want veggies with the clear broth to make it taste better).  All the food we ordered was at least average. The sliced beef, lamb, chicken, and select beef were all very delicious and thin enough so I can eat them mere seconds after putting it in the hot pot. The homemade balls ranged from average in terms of the cuttlefish balls to very good for the beef meat balls. I also liked the baby cuttlefish and small octopus (the small octopus is basically the large version of the baby cuttlefish). Finally, their mango baby milo dessert was quite tasty.  Service started okay until we got our first order in. After that, however, it was almost impossible to wave someone down, and their policy is that you can't order anything unless you fill it with a form. I don't mind that, but how about saving some paper to better the environment?  Nevertheless, I'm willing to overlook the service as long as the food remains as good as what it is right now, and especially with winter approaching hot pot is starting to become a fixture for me."}
{"text":"A-OK hotpot restaurant in my books. Been here a few times and it doesn't impress but also doesn't disappoint. Overall great selection of foods (meats, veggies and everything inbetween). The last time I was here they did run out of a few dishes that I really like. Their sauce selection beats most places allowing you to conjure up that perfect sauce mix.  Service can be greatly improved to be honest my expectations are pretty low for a low key hotpot place like this one.   I'm still on the hunt for that perfect hotpot in Markham."}
{"text":"Make sure you have ur stretchiest eating pants on or else you're just going to have to unbutton ur button cause you will leave this place super satisfied and full. So far this is the best hot pot place in Toronto. I always get their tom yum (extra $$) and their satay. Half and half. Their home made beef balls are delicious because they are home made and they also have tender hand cut beef u have to ask for as well as normal beef. Been coming here for years and always return here. I've never had a bad experience here other than sometimes they don't accept card. It's uncertain which days they will accept and which they wouldn't do always have cash prepared. It's right across from world bowl so u can bowl first then come after to eat. They are opened until 3am which is good for all those late night hot pot cravings. They also have hot plate rice that u can order. As well as Asian desserts at the end. Their peanut sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of shared-pot hotpot places as items can get lost, and food preparation can get a little shady with many people poking around the pot.  I have to say that one of my best hotpot experiences was at Kim Tao.  The place was not too busy on a weekday evening and with a little pot management, the experience was very pleasant.  They have a large variety of items that can be ordered off a menu, which was a nice experience too.  The service was quick and friendly.  My friends and I sat there for hours on end just chattering away long after we were full from the hotpot and the waiters respected that.  They were not intrusive and were happy to come back to take our dessert orders.  Their desserts of mango and red bean puddings were delicious, and of course they had ice cream too."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge hot pot fan so I rarely go out for it. However, my friend's mom graciously treated a few of us to dinner and we decided on this restaurant.  We came here on a Saturday night and it was quite hard to find parking. I would also recommend making reservations because it can get quite busy. There was the seven of us so we got a large table. There were 3 pots in total and each pot had a divider so each pot can hold two different soup base. I chose the satay soup base and I can just handle the spice level.  There's quite a lot to choose from to cook. One of the more interesting item on the menu was the pig's fallopian tube...I have to say, I quite enjoyed it! My friend, Alex Y., ordered a seasonal vegetable (not sure of the Chinese or English name) and it had a very unique taste to it (just another example of their large selection).  The reason why I'm giving this restaurant four star instead of five is because they never give us exactly what we ordered. Also, I'm slightly disappointed that they don't have dessert. After this experience,I think I'm starting to enjoy hot pot!"}
{"text":"I had only ever been to Little Sheep for hotpot before, but this time I wanted to try something closer to home. This place was equally as delicious, the food came out promptly and I left more than satisfied. They were out of kimchi and the pickled radish, which was unfortunate but other than that all of the meat, seafood and vegetables were fresh and flavourful!   I had read reviews before going and so was expecting the meal to be reasonably priced, but it ended up being close to $80 for two people (only one beer was ordered).. Maybe because it was a Saturday and we ordered the spicy broth which was slightly more expensive. Regardless, if you're looking for a hotpot hotspot, this place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times... each and every time they are always out of the expensive stuff. Or if you order an expensive item they are magically out of it on the next plate.  The have new menu items which also are out of on the regular. lol  The service is not friendly at all, everyone has a pickle up their butt. Lol   Come here for the after 10pm special. Before 10pm it's not worth $25 the meat is so dried out it sticks to the plates you can tell it's been sitting for a longgggg while in the fridge."}
{"text":"When we are talking about hotpot, you don't need a fancy soup based, you don't need a thousand of dipping sauce to choose from, the most important is keep everything fresh.  This restaurant open for more than ten years( as I remember, even thought I am not sure still under the same boss or not). Haven't come back for years due to not living near by, it brought back alot of good memory from the old days. Food is fresh, which the most important for hotpot. Will make time to come more often."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my girlfriend and the start of the night was great.  We got there and was immediately sat down.  We got water and juice and drink and they just brought one jug of each.  The menu was pretty long and it seemed like it would be a good dinner.  We also noticed they had free Wi-Fi and after making our order, the food came right away with the hotpot.  First, make sure you check the type of meal you want to have at the top of your order sheet.  We didn't check off either so we were brought a seafood platter... neither of us eat seafood so we sent it back.  The waiter said next time to check off either beef or seafood on the card, so he took it back and never did give us the beef platter.  The hotpot soup bases were not nearly what we expected of them.  My girlfriend ordered a mix of two flavours and one of the flavours was overpowering the other by a fair bit.  Mine was a chicken base, but it had zero chicken flavour to it and pretty much tasted like I was eating from plain water.  This pretty much caused the rest of the food we have very little flavour.  The meats in particular weren't that great but I don't really know if that's because of our soup base or because of the meat itself.  The service mediocre.  They were very quick to bring us what we ordered after we sent the card, which is good.  My two complaints stem from the above (in the second paragraph) and that they never checked up on us - not once.  So each and every time, we had to flag someone down... which was hard because I think I saw two employees the entire night and they were usually in the back or behind the counter - which wasn't in our view from our table.  The price in itself for hotpot wasn't awful but they tack on an extra 10% for service, which I find to be a  little silly.  I left this place full, but not in a way that I actually enjoyed it.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and despite the terrible service, is still probably one of the better hot pot places in toronto. It has decent selection and comes with free lemon tea and dessert. They have off menu items like hot pot rice and fried chicken wings too.   But the service is terrible. You never get everything you order and they are pretty rude to you. Especially the owner. That guy is the worst. His wife is nicer, but the owner is terrible."}
{"text":"This hot pot is very good!  I highly recommend it for the seafood which includes giant oysters as well as the noodles - they even have chewy yummy rice cake!!  The food looks fresh unlike some other hot pot places."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend. The price is quite good for all you can eat hot pot. They had two units for the restaurant with the washroom in only one of them. As a result, the wait staff was not always easy to reach. However, they were polite & fast.  The restaurant looks a bit worn down (got sticky tables too) but the food was alright for the value & I haven't had stomach problems :) They also gave us free plum & ice tea pitchers & would fill it up whenever it was empty.  Not too much variety for the dipping sauce though. Pretty much only soy sauce, peanut sauce, garlic."}
{"text":"I came here in the end of August 2014 with a group of 6 so it was only 1/3 full as it was summer and I guess not a lot of people eat hotpot in the summer. You choose the sauces you want and they bring it to your table. The service was very speedy. They also brought two pitchers of lemon tea and plum juice (included in the AYCE price) which were satisfying. We stayed for over 3 hours and they didn't rush us to leave, but then again it was summer so it wasn't busy anyways.  The parking lot is pretty big and wraps around so I never had trouble finding parking.  I will update this review if I come during the Winter as it seems like people have a lot of issues with the service during Winter!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.   Refuse to give us dessert.  The guy saw that we had a fruit drink still on the table, and told us not to waste, that wasting is no good, that we should finish our specialty drink before ordering the small bowl of mango pudding deserts. Very rude.  Everytime we asked for more napkins, the guy and girl servers were not polite. I felt not comfortable and not welcomed to ask for more napkins. Didn't look happy giving us more napkins.  People there don't like to smile. Including the boss.  I'm going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place a while back and later found that just about all my Asian friends know about it. It is an all you can eat hot pot place just across the street from World-bowl.   This is a great place to go on a cold day or night. You make your own dipping sauce from a nice variety of ingredients. Then you add whatever foods you wish into the large boiling pot in front of you. There are plenty of tasty items to choose from.   if you are cold and/or hungry, this is a great place to go. Just don't be afraid to grab a waiter when they walk by or they might not notice you."}
{"text":"Across from world bowl. They have a late night dinner price as well which we usually try to get as well (if we can stand starving till then). Overall I think this is so far the best AYCE hot pot place. A little sketch maybe but I am totally fine with it.  The ice tea or plum juice is pretty good and lots of variety. For all those vegetarians, they also have a better AYCE selection compared to 100 degrees and you don't have to pay more.  On the down side I think the only issue is their dessert can improve."}
{"text":"generally i don't like to pay to cook my own food. hot pot is an exception. for drinks, u get a pitcher of iced tea and a pitcher of prune juice. i can NOT do the prune juice. that stuff makes my lips purse and face shrivel up like a raisin. iced tea please!  anyways, it's more or less what you expect from a hot pot place. you can ask for raw egg to add to your sauce. they have this weird thing u squeeze out of a plastic bag that turns into some sort of weird noodle, i dont know what's so special about it other than it's interesting to watch it cook. u can also get the home made meat balls which come on this weird silver paddle type thing and u kinda separate the meat concoction yourself into the hot pot where it cooks. honestly, i'd avoid that just because it's like this premade meat concoction that might've been sitting there a while and sometimes it has a weird smell/sour taste to it, like it has expired. my friends order it, i avoid it, it'll stick with lamb slices and udon noodles."}
{"text":"Can't survive the cold weather without going for some hot pot. This place is probably my restaurant of choice for hot pot in Markham/Richmond Hill. This place offers variety, good and fresh food (no freezer burn on the meat), is quick on orders, fair portions, but with average service.  They offer bottomless ice tea or prune juice, have food options such as chicken wings and other rice dishes, as well as desserts like taro tapioca dessert. It is at a reasonably good price for ayce."}
{"text":"I usually come here with friends around 7-8PM. Food is good, meat is fresh and free of freezer burn. The free, bottomless iced tea is amazing and is made in the restaurant! Compliments the dinner very well. Service is average, but this restaurant can hold it's own when busy. Selection of food is great!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hotpot places, however the price has been increased after renovation so I didn't really go back often compared to those times before. The renovated restaurants seem to have more rooms and booth seatings available which I really enjoy to sit with a group of friends.   I like it when there are quite variety of options to choose. For the price, you get similar options that other hotpot places offers. The plus is beverage and some kitchen foods are included such as chicken wings (very tiny wings tho), the fried sticky rice - it is my favorite and I couldn't find any other place around that has it better than Kimtao. And if you ask for dessert in the end, you can get it free of charge. The broth is okay, in my opinion. I prefer the spicy one over anything else.   Service is okay. Sometimes it is a little bit hard to get their attention if you sit around the corner.   Overall, I still like Kimtao hotpot and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service is very bad, the employees look like they hate life. They also charge a service fee which I feel they don't deserve."}
{"text":"Everyone loves this place yet they're giving a 3/5 stars.  If you come here,  you will never go back to any other hot pot place again.  The selection in food is wide,  the ox tongue and hand made meat balls are definitely my favorite things on the menu.  If it's your first time you must try the satay soup base.    They offer you a pitcher of lemon tea or plum juice included in the ayce price as well.   Late night after 10pm special is 16$/head which is really reasonable since they give you the same option as regular dinner.   Yes,  service us a little slow but the performance from the servers shouldn't refect the stars you give.  I mean,  bad service is usually expected from Chinese restaurant anyway. If you are choosing between 100 degrees or here.,  come to kim tao.  Or you'll end up having a stomach ache.  ...  And for the ladies,  there's free dessert!"}
{"text":"AYCE hot pot? My father's eyes lighted up after I told him that's where we heading for dinner... an early dinner...  Kim Tao Hot Pot has Senior Specials which further gave him that little twinkle in his eyes... and for all he know is that he can eat more than me but pay less than me, that's definitely a bargain.  I am glad that we arrived early on a Sunday evening at 5:30 pm the place was empty and we got all our orders quick and fresh.   While I enjoying my handmade balls: fish, beef and cuttlefish, my father ate 3 rounds of beef.......   The services did go downhill when the place started to fill up..... but by that time, we were done eating and ready to leave.  I'll be back to Kim Tao Hot Pot with an empty stomach... ready to eat!!"}
{"text":"Suck, bad services.  Waiting at the front for table for 20 minute without anyone approach to help.  The owner has bad attitude and like to yell at the customer.  I could not stand his attitude and service.  I left before we get a table and i don't think i will come back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since my highschool days over 10 years ago and it has always remained consistent. I'll be honest, it isn't the best hotpot out there and the service isn't exactly amazing but you expect that coming here. I can come to this place 10 times in a row and never have a single word said to you by any of the servers and that's okay because you come here for the food and to eat until you hate yourself.  What I like about Kim Tao is that they have a really good selection of foods including tendons and other things that many places don't have. They also have non-hotpot options such as fried rice or fried wings which is included in your meal so make sure to check out the posters on the wall. They also give you either plum juice or lemon iced tea which you can even ask for both. I personally don't like either so I opt for iced water which I only drink after I'm done to make sure I fill my stomach more.  What I usually get here is the satay soup base since almost no other hotpot places I go to have it. You might need to ask for satay sauce on the side and add it to the soup as I find the soup has been lacking over recent years. I order a few sauce options for my meat but ultimately, I like my soup flavourful enough that I don't need a sauce to dip. For my meat option, I get the typical sliced meat, tendon beef balls (handmade takes forever to cook), tripe, tendons, luncheon meat. I will also get mushrooms, gluten balls, instant noodles and etc. The service is quick so if you need more, there's no worry.  They have a few soup options that are included in the price of your meal but there are some options that cost a $5 additional fee. If you eat here during regular hours, make sure to mark off whether you want seafood or beef (there's more than just beef, it's basically the non-seafood option) or else they will default you to the seafood option which costs quite a bit more. A tip would be to come after 10 as there is a special (check this off on the order sheet) where you save a few bucks on the beef option. Lastly, your meal comes with a free mango and/or taro sago dessert so make sure to finish off with that.  You can always come here knowing that it won't disappoint you, even if it doesn't wow you."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good. Meat quality was decent and they provide jugs of drinks.   We came here on the week of Chinese New Years (Wednesday), not actual New Year's Day but they still charged us holiday/weekend prices. We disputed with management that it's not even a holiday but he responded it's Chinese New Year \"week\". Felt a little ripped off cause they never told us so it ruined our experience. Plus they force service charge on you."}
{"text":"All you can eat hot pot in Richmond Hill.   It is pretty much like any typical hot pot places, just possibly a little cheaper. The seafood option on a weekday was around $25.00. With the seafood, you get oysters, scallops, mussels, salmon, shrimp and.. some other white fish.   My friend and I came here on a Tuesday evening.. they were pretty full! We were greeted and asked what we would like to drink. The drink is also all you can drink, ice lemon tea or plum/prune juice.   There isn't really much to comment about the food since it is like any typical hot pot places. One thing I can comment on is that they have sides, such as... deep fried chicken wings, dumplings, wonton, side dishes like kimchi and radishes that also come with your all you can eat meal if you ask - mind you, you may be required to ask for it twice since they tend to forget... especially when busy.  Side note, 10% service charge will be added to your bill ~ just an FYI."}
