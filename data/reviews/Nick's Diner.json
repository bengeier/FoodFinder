{"text":"I first heard about this place from Cleveland Magazine's 2010 edition that focused on Cleveland's best diners.  We decided to check it out on a Saturday morning at about 10 a.m.   The address is on Lorain, but consider parking on a side street to avoid the metered spaces out in front of the restaurant.  We parked on the north side of Lorain, because it seemed to be a slightly better neighborhood than on the south side, and only had to walk a quarter of a block to the front door.  We were lucky when we got there, because there was just one open table and it was a two-top. Actually there seemed to be a charmed quality to the morning, because the place was continually full, but it seemed like every time a party walked in, one of the tables would finish up and leave ... no one ever seemed to wait more than 2-3 minutes before they got a table.  The ambiance of the place was interesting.  As for the decor, it looked a little schizophrenic.  One side of the restaurant is sort of an industrial-80s homage, while the other side is a neo-graffiti mural of a Japanese-style monster attacking Cleveland.  It almost seemed like there were two owners who each got to choose the decoration for their side of the room.  The crowd was incredibly diverse for Cleveland.  There were a few families with kids, while at another table there were a group of bikers, and at another was a table of gentlemen of three different ethnicities. It was a mix of different races, economic groups, ages, and social statuses.  The service was pretty quick.  We had a very attentive waitress who welcomed us and informed us that the restaurant had been in the newspaper that morning, and told us that she'd bring us the article to read.  We found this charming, although we didn't really care so much about reading the review.  The menu is extensive and the prices are surprisingly low.  We took advantage of the the economical options to try out a few extra dishes.  I ordered the \"Three Eggs with Two Sausage patties, hashbrowns andtoast\" for only $4. I also ordered a side of three pancakes FOR $3.50.  My partner got the \"buiscuits and gravy\" which came with three eggs, and hashbrowns, for $5. He also got a side of corned beef hash for $2.50.  Overall the food was just fine; it's exactly what you expect from breakfast food at a diner. My critique is that nothing was extraordinary.    The eggs were done very well.  Mine were scrambled, and were fluffy, without being too moist or too dry.  My partner had his over easy, and they were perfection.  The pancakes were light and very hot, which made them perfect for soaking up the butter.  There were a few minor disappointments though. The hashbrowns were mushy, without any real crust to them.  I think they were frozen potato strips that were kept on the griddle for too long without enough oil to make them crisp.  The gravy for the biscuits was a little underwhelming, and may have come ready made.  The corned beef hash also seemed like it was from a can. Again, it tasted okay, but these are simple dishes that can be done easily and well from scratch.  I mentioned before that the waitress was very attentive; unfortunately, the kitchen was a somewhat slow.  Despite the delay, the waitress did an amazing job of keeping our coffee full, and letting us know about where things stood in the kitchen.  While we would have liked our food about 10 minutes sooner than we got it, the customer service more than made up for the delay, and she waitress could hardy have done a better job of making sure we knew we had not been forgotten.  Overall we really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Planning another trip to Cleveland, I tried to find the outstanding diner we ate at in August. I recalled excellent Yelp reviews and it was reasonably priced. Corn beef hash was tasty and homemade. Servers were polite and food was served quickly. Not recalling the name, I looked at photos to find the memorable art work. Finally, I matched the photos with my memory of our outstanding breakfast. However, ratings had slipped significantly. Here's why - 5 diners on 9/6/14 wrote terrible reviews. Obviously, they were from the same party. This was the first review for 4 and second for 1. It's sad that these 5 had the power for this great diner to lose a star. Read their commentary - it's immature and overly dramatic. We will try Nick's again and pay particular attention to the cleanliness, food and service."}
{"text":"Nick's has been a Lorain-fave for years.  I almost always get the breakfast special.  Staff is super nice.  Great spot for quick and easy."}
{"text":"I love nicks!!!!! The people that work there are great, and make the experience better! But let's not forget people,eggs and potatoes are cheap, and nicks uses the cheapest you can get.  The2.99$ special is great!  If you don't feel like making eggs at home, 3 eggs your style, bacon, and buttery ( very very very buttery ) home fries and some cheap toast ! I enjoy the special often, but keep in mind the quality of food used.   The bacon can be a hit or miss, depending how greasy it is that day. The skillets are not bad, just don't take them to go- cheaper food does not taste good cold. The burgers taste good but don't make you feel good .   The interior is very cool!  They recently remodeled ( thank god) and have interesting art around the walls . The staff is great, I have seen them handle a packed place with speed.    Like I said, the price goes hand in hand with quality."}
{"text":"Great place! Great people! I worked at Nicks for about a year and it was a wounderful life experience! Keep up the good work guys!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat at counter for 10 minutes, didn't get acknowledged by the waitress and then 2 people sat down and got served coffee. Finally just walked out!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday morning experience. A little grungy, not dirty, loved the comic book inspired artwork!  service perfect, coffee STRONG; in a big cup,  eggs cooked like I ordered and hash browns were REAL. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Our server was awesome! However, the food was not up to par. The home fries were good but the crescent and eggs were not very good. It's pretty hard to mess up breakfast food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Two eggs, two pieces of toast, two slices of bacon, homefries, and coffee for like $5 total. I love Nicks! The artwork adorning the walls is cheerful and fun, the servers are fast, friendly, happy, and seem to enjoy their jobs, and the food is great! It's simple, old-school Cleveland, and the quality of everything is great."}
{"text":"Ok, Seriously one of my favorite places for breakfast. I've came here for ten years!!! I haven't recommenced my friends to Nicks, i brought them with me. Omlets are my fav. Nice Menu, Cheap but great food. I love the coffee they have too. They always ask if i want to put my coffee in a to-go cup before i leave ... (if i have not finished) The art is different and unique. This place has changed inside year by year. & Only for the better. My son loves the kids menu they offer too! As well as the batman portrait they have on the wall. (he always want to sit in the seat below it) Great, quick service, highly recommend. It is really busy on weekends so if i ever go its usually on a week day morning or later on a sunday morning! Thanks Nicks!"}
{"text":"$2.99 special..3 eggs, bacon, grits and toast.  Good food for a ridiculously low price.  My hubby and FIL had the corned beef hash and cleaned their plates.  They liked the coffee as well.  Very friendly service with obvious regulars."}
{"text":"This was bad. I'm in fetal position in my bed now. The server was nice but everything was filthy from the menu to the dishes to the interior. Eggs weren't cooked, hash browns weren't cooked, the skillet thing I ordered looked and tasted like garbage disposal."}
{"text":"Good Food. Friendly and speedy service."}
{"text":"Just had what happens to be the most disgusting salad and soup I've had in my entire life (See pic). Should have gone to the place down the street. My bf's eggs, hashbrowns, and toast weren't horrible... Service is really really slow. Took us 20 minutes to get our check when we were finished. Overall atmosphere is crummy and filled with crap."}
{"text":"Nick's is great.  I've been going for breakfast for several years.  Great food at a great price, especially when Victor is cooking.  My usual is an omlet with a side of cheesy grits, as my low-carb compromise with life.  But it's a great menu with a lot if diversity, but very down to earth.  The pancakes are excellent.  As a regular, I get a lot of sugar from the waitresses, which is fun.  If you like pretty, Nick's is not for you.  I like a funky, non-corporate eatery, so Nick's is where I go when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Nick's is a small diner that has cheap food and generous portions. Typical breakfast spot with omlets, pancakes, eggs, etc..I would say their skillets are exceptional. No frills type of place. It's what you call a greasy spoon. You can't go wrong if you know what you're in for. Your bill should never be over $12, unless you leaving a 30% tip. I never order their orange juice is high as F%*%*% and it's not the calcium kind. Just stick to water. They'll charge you on the refills too."}
{"text":"I'm not picky about breakfast, especially when I walk into a dive diner., but the coffee was awful and the overcooked eggs and sausage were even worse"}
{"text":"A little too avaunt guard for me. Food was great. Good sized portions.  Pretty noisy.  My waitress was falling out of her clothes(not worth the view)."}
{"text":"We stopped here after the wait at Grumpy's was a little too long. We sat down at the table next to the door that doesn't shut on its own, so we had to get up and shut it every time someone left because the draft was terrible. I ordered and egg sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. It comes with three eggs and he asked if they would only give him two and the very rude waitress heavily sighed and replies \"No, we can't do that. We're really busy and the cooks won't stop to read the ticket. Just throw the egg out\". After about 20 min, toast arrives at the table and nothing else. We sat and watched as all of the people who sat after us got their food. After about 20 more minutes the waitress comes over and said the kitchen is \"slammed\" and she doesn't know when our food is coming. I asked her how that was possible since it wasn't that busy and others were gettin food that ordered after us and she threw her hands up and said \"I DONT KNOW\" and stormed away. At this point, we decided to leave. So, I can't comment on the quality of the food since we never received any but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Nick's Diner. $1.99 for three eggs, three pieces of bacon or sausage, and two pieces of toast. can't. beat. it.  your arteries may start to hate you, but dang, it's ONE NINETY NINE."}
{"text":"I like Nick's......excellent service, great food, good prices, lots of refills, and cc accepted.  What's not to like?  Well....it just is not clean.  The place is really shabby.  The server was having hot flashes and propped open the door, ok except it was COLD.  I will return, but no way am I going to get my husband back there."}
{"text":"Charmed when I walked in.  Unusual decor. Funky and cool.  No complaints about the cheese sticks.  Timely delivery of food.   When I ordered the $2.99 breakfast special, However inexpensive, as  Only an idiot would have done, Reality set in.  Eggs scrambled with cheese, please.  But the eggs were pre-made, And the sign said otherwise.  Great toast. Bland home fries. Bacon OK.   What I couldn't believe, And I'm not kidding, Is that the cheese was not melted.  The cheese was actually sprinkled on top. Really? Even though I asked them to fix it, just Scramble the damn cheese in, Scramble it and melt it,  Bitch said \"no.\" She Even came back to make fun of me.  This guy- this paying customer- This man likes his cheese hot.  Eggs should never be lukewarm Regardless of the price.   When I left, my friends were upset.  And I was ready to Throw down with that nasty lady.  Crummy old diner wench Has no idea how to treat a guest.   Otherwise it was great. I was  Unimpressed with the food and service, The experience, however, was memorable."}
{"text":"Would go again. $2 for 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, hash browns and toast.  It's a greasy spoon, so know what you're getting when you head in. Food was at the table in under 7 minutes. Server was quick and attentive, restaurant was clean and we sat immediately.  For the quality, speed of food delivery, price, and overall demeanor of the restaurant, this was a great experience and slightly exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great diner food, ambiance and prices, Nick's is the spot for you.  Sure, I could see through the floorboard underneath me, noticing the assortment of items in the basement below that would impale me if I were to fall through.  But you know what?  It worked with the place.  And I sat down happy as could be anyway.   It's just that kind of place.  Nick's has the food you've craving, the staff that have the personality that make you want to return to every day and the prices that make you smile on the way out."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is great if you are nursing a hangover! Super cheap breakfast all day and also a selection of sandwiches and burgers for those insane people who do not enjoy breakfast.  We got here at 11:30am on a Saturday and it was pretty packed. However, by noon it had emptied out. I would recommend coming around that time if you can, but there's also a patio which helps add more room.   The burger and fries looked great (handmade patty!) but unfortunately I thought my eggs combo was just way too greasy. This is a personal preference because my stomach can't handle any grease or fat. Everything was cooked in it."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice little find I have been going to for several months now. Small...way better than the larger Ihops of the world. Food is good and brought out to you quickly. Staff is very friendly. Just come in and find an empty table to sit at or just sit at the bar. Ona run, then just get it carry out. Pancakes are the bomb here...best I have had in a while. Eggs are good as well. Gets crowded some Sat but the wait is never long if it is."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite weekend brunch spots. Its like your favorite diner but it has awesome comic book art on the walls. They take credit cards on bills over $5. As other people mentioned, they close at 3 pm on weekdays and 4pm on weekends.  Its prolly true that I can make food of a similar quality at home, but I don't want to. When my friends are hungry after a night out, I would rather sit around with the drinking coffee at Nick's as opposed to cooking in my kitchen. Their entrees are big and filling."}
{"text":"Small diner in Ohio city . Fast friendly service ! Great breakfast . Rumor has it they are opening the patio this summer and some changes to the menu . Excited to see this happen .."}
{"text":"go to nicks they said, you'll love it they said. corn beef out of a can tastless pancakes and bad service. keep it."}
{"text":"Such a great little place we found by accident. We had appointments at the tattoo shop beside it and while we were outside it smelled so good we had to check it out. We were greeted by at least two different employees with friendly smiles and they suggested we check out the patio. The patio was quaint with a bohemian vibe. Very pretty. And the food was amazing. Def worth checking out"}
{"text":"All I can say is service is great, like your aunt's house. And the price is right. I will return."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here at Nick's Diner. There's great artwork all over the walls. Full of retro references and a gun vibe. I ordered coffee and French toast and bacon. My meal tasted like it came out of my granny's kitchen. The coffee came in a mug large enough to give an elephant the caffeine jitters...which is a great thing haha. The waitress was dressed like a cat (Halloween/or just how she rolls) either way I liked it haha She was very accommodating when it came to substituting out items to make the meal to my liking.  All of this and the meal was like $6.00!!!! Definitely stop by if you're in he area."}
{"text":"Always happy every time I come here. Great food and good service when you can find a seat!"}
{"text":"... This place is a definite hole in the wall. I've been here a couple of times and have tried several different dishes and I'm mad i wasted my money every time. First off, it has maybe 6 tables, that's fine small is fine, BUT it's dirty! I saw a couple of dust mites in the corner of the booth I sat in, gross. Secondly, the waitresses were cursing like truckers, throwing the toast into the toaster like barbarians. The one blonde woman was covered in piercings and tattoos, not exactly how I want my eggs served but I'll leave that one alone. To each his own. The food quality was minimal, you're paying $3 for breakfast so beggars really can't be choosers. It's good for me to run around the corner and grab some grub but only tolerable once in a while. There's better in Ohio city for sure..."}
{"text":"The food is exactly what you would expect from a greasy spoon diner: delicious, huge portions, and inexpensive. Service is attentive enough and personable. We enjoyed the variety on the menu as well as the unique decor. Don't come here expecting anything fancy, but come with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"The reason Nick's doesn't receive the famed \"Brandon's Five Star Rating\" is unfortunate, because it's easily remedied.  They're only open until 3pm.   Yes...I know...that's absolutely the dumbest thing I'VE ever heard as well.   That said, this is a great place. Inexpensive breakfasts and lunch, as most everyone previously mentioned.   The decor is pretty sweet; the walls are pasted with comic book characters and various pulp art. The booths are very comfortable, four can sit comfortably. There's a small counter with stools, but I think you'd have to be a fairly established regular to feel comfortable there, as you're RIGHT on top of the staff and non-food prep counters.  There's an awesome claw machine, that has some pretty good treasures if you can manage to sag them.  Again, if this place were open past 3pm, they'd have more business than they could handle, as there's no good place in the neighborhood to hang late and get diner food.   I head to Johnny Mango's for those excursions.   But for breakfast, they're king."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I went with some friends and we sat in a booth against the left wall.  There is a ridge/shelf on the wall that looks like it has NEVER been cleaned. It is completely covered with dust, spider webs, and dead bugs.  We should have known to just leave. The menus are DISGUSTING - falling apart and covered in slime. There is dirt packed into every crevice and area where the lamination is peeling off. There was old food crust on the coffee mugs. Our toasts came out at least 15 minutes before the rest of our meals. My toast was burnt black, my friends' toasts looked like they didnt even get in the toaster. When the rest of the food came out, most of our eggs were still kind of raw - even in the omelette and the scramble... My \"homefries\" were raw, while the person next to me had theirs burnt... Someone ordered a burger and fries - their burger was way over well done, while their fries also appeared nearly raw.  I really wanted to like this place, but it's just not going to happen. I'd like to say \"you get what you pay for,\" but there are other diners in the ohio city/gordon square area with super cheap, under $3 breakfasts that are very clean and have food that is actually cooked.  I hope the health department reads this."}
{"text":"Still a solid place for breakfast.  It is above a greasy spoon and the staff has been improved over the past few years.  The breakfast special plus coffee is $3.17 on weekdays so add tip and you're at $5.  Very fast service most times and seems relatively clean."}
{"text":"The breakfast special is the best reason to come here.   Also if you sit around long enough on quiet weekdays around mid morning, some of the most interesting people walk in. I feel like This American Life could do a full show on the stories of the people who come in and out of there and who work there.   I wish I loved anything as much as the waitresses love calling everybody \"Honey\" and as much as they love refilling your coffee.   Sometimes the eggs are WAY greasier than they should be so I'm knocking a star off for not being consistent there. Otherwise, good to go."}
{"text":"Classic diner with the best breakfast in Cleveland. And it's cheap."}
{"text":"If you like rude servers and average food cone to this hole in the wall. One of the servers here actually came and took one of the condiments off my table without asking if I was done with it and took it to another table. They really need to get better servers in this place if they expect repeat business."}
{"text":"The restaurant is A1, is cover in local artist graffiti all over the walls. The good is excellent apart that I only come here for the breakfast special it brings 3 eggs any style with side of home fries and ether bacon or sausage. There always female serving you, theres one that a bigger girl that world her butt off and is great with memorizing your Oder and name for that matter. There a dark haired woman  bane (KATHY) that is a delight in the morning but there a older woman that should be fired. She is always picking fight with every one and I should know I come here every day for morning and I see how she treats people very unprofessional she drops plate and blames on the clients, if you order on the front stall and you didn't say it was to go she will automatically put it to go with out consent!. If you Oder normally she will make you repeat it as loud as she can to make you feel like crap! And if the order is wrong she will blame you for it and say done bull like \"I tried to repeat it that why I asked you!\" She is the worst always picking fights with the cook in front of customers! There nothing pleasant about her but apart from that food is A1"}
{"text":"Family restaurant?  Nick's is one of the places I think of (fondly) when I reminisce about the many hours I spent with Cleveland's homeless population.  I also think of it as more of a hot-dog place than a restaurant, although it is kind of a breakfast place.  If you like gritty old-school places with greasy food, then you'll love this place.  If you don't like places like this, please don't come here and then complain about it.  You've already gentrified too much of the West Side; let the people have Lorain Avenue at least."}
{"text":"I figured this place would have a million good reviews, but was surprised to see it didn't yet, so alas, I must come to the rescue to tell you all-go here!  I used to live in Ohio City, and we came here for breakfast almost every Saturday morning.  The prices are great, the atmosphere is great, and the food is great!  My fiance swears by their skillets, while I often go for their french toast.  It's right near the West Side Market, so I could totally see going to Nick's and heading off to the market, or vice versa, for you early birds.  The place screams Cleveland, has tons of personality, and the food is delicious.  I can't comment on the lunch/dinner fare, as we always do breakfast here, but I'd imagine if it's anything like the breakfast fare it has to be good!  If you're in the mood for a funky little diner with great reasonably priced food, this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"Recovering from the flu demands serious comfort food!  We weren't disappointed here.  I got the hobo skillet and hubby got the club.  Huge portions - - all at a great price!  I think the secret to this place is coming for lunch (all day breakfast served!)."}
{"text":"The food for the price spot on. You get what you expect for the price and the food came out relatively quick. I needed to add a bit of seasoning but overall a good amount of food for a fraction of the price. The outside patio was awesome with even some friendly neighborhood turtles. I take a star away for the service which was pretty slow. It was early brunch and not that many people were there. Getting the check took 15 minutes after asking for it :( and another star unfortunately for blandness. But if you are looking for some homey food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is a very kinda normal breakfast place, but it is very good. For kids, they provide character cups, from Star Wars or Marvel. The French Toast here is very good. I totally recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost.  Very slow service. Very slow food. Food was sub par  (which for the price is understandable). They gave me my orange juice warm.    Avoid this place. You're better off getting mcdonalds breakfast at least their service is better."}
{"text":"This is a nitty-gritty kind of place to grab breakfast. It's not your fancy schmancy breakfast place with cappuccinos or lattes. Here you get breakfast straight up, the 'bang for your buck' kind of deal. My friend I came here on the weekend, thankfully it wasn't too packed when we arrived. I ordered their breakfast special, and a coffee. As we waited for our dishes to come out. We spent some time looking around all the art collections they have, I'm guessing they are from local artists around CLE. It's quite entertaining seeing all the random decorative pieces they have, and album covers. Our meals came out literally 10minutes later, wow that was fast! The meal was solid, no complaints from my end. When the bill arrived I couldn't believe how little our meal ended up costing. It has been a while since I paid so less while dining out, and for the amount of food you get it's amazing! Thanks for the fast meal, Nick's Diner!"}
{"text":"Nick's is great if you're looking for a simple, not overpriced brunch. The staff are friendly, the menu has a good selection of egg dishes and the food is fast. I've had the egg skillets on occasion and never been disappointed. The French toast is even good if you're looking for a basic, no frills French toast. They also do breakfast to-go- just call ahead and it will be ready for you!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I found all of the rave reviews for Nick's - so I was a bit disappointed in my experience.  Came in early for breakfast. Let me first say that the staff were very friendly and nice.  I ordered an Omelet with mushrooms, spinach, bell peppers, onions, and swiss cheese and a side of bacon and an orange juice. I asked for tomato juice, but they don't offer that as an option.  The execution on the Omelet was lacking - the bell pepper consisted of huge strips and chunks of bell pepper - some dicing would have made them sauté up or cook through more evenly. As it was, much of the bell pepper was close to raw. The spinach taste and texture makes me think they thawed out a bag of frozen spinach from the store and just threw a wad of it in the omelet - the vegetables would have tasted a lot better had they first been sautéed before throwing them into the Omelet.  The hash browns that were served with the Omelet were disgusting. They were overdone and tasted like they had been pre-cooked and then left to sit and then served up as needed.  The bacon was excellent.  Service was also very good. I loved the decor of the place.   Even though the place is a diner, it could use a good, thorough scrubbing from top to bottom.  I'll give this place another chance next time I am in Cleveland and hope what I experienced was not an anomaly."}
{"text":"2 specials 2 coffees. (under 10 dollars) Monday morning before work. Super convenient.. Great price great environment  inside the place. We both enjoyed it. This will be our new weekly breakfast place now that they two of us both work downtown. 3 eggs, Hash Browns and Sausage. Everything was cooked exactly as I would have expected. Nothing undercooked/overcooked. just perfect!. We are going to try them for lunch here shortly.  Super convenient if you get to downtown by getting off the W44th exit on I-90 and meander through Ohio City to get downtown. I could see coming to this place for years to come."}
{"text":"Very nice place went there earlier today with my mom, uncle & brother, wet had the breakfast special $1.99 3 eggs, meat, home fries & toast, mom & brother had scrambled eggs with the sides brother had to return his eggs because his eggs were undercooked, still able to see the white/clear part of the eggs, mom's wss more cooked than his, my uncle & I  both had eggs over medium, eggs were perfectly cooked the easy I like them, the bacon was thick cutcooked perfectly, the potatoes were great toast was just that toast, coffee was good, the wait staff was great my uncle is a jokester glad they had a humor & was able to dish it out to him also, over & all it was great food & corrected the mistake without hassle didn't push the issue or requested a discount, keep up the great job..."}
{"text":"So... I used to LOVE Nick's. I could count on the friendliest staff, quick, hot food, good coffee, and the prices were unreasonably cheap. Ever since the management changes, there have been some nice improvements:  the decor was updated, the tables were rearranged to accommodate more patrons, and the plates and cups match more (if that kind of thing matters to you). But this is no longer my old Nick's. The last few visits have been SO disappointing. Today, it took a very long time to get our coffee and food. When our food came out, it was missing toast. Toast came out once our food was basically finished, and was cold. Cold toast. Yuckkkk. Then it took the better part of 20 minutes to get our checks. I miss old Nick's. I miss Leigh. I miss the mismatched cups. Latitude has better food anyway."}
{"text":"This is a new place for me to dine at. Very nice and cozy. I ordered a breakfast skillet. And it looks amazing. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of every item on the menu which is important in the restaurant business. Ty also have a big ole 65\" tv to look at mounted on the wall."}
{"text":"$3 breakfast includes 3 eggs (any style), 3 pieces of meat (sausage or bacon), toast, and hashbrowns!  Need I say more??  ok I will... the diner was such a cool, laid-back, art-filled environment to enjoy a  simple, yet satisfying meal at. This will be on the list next time I'm in Ohio City."}
{"text":"i eat here every time i go to my tattoo spot ! good cheap food :] the breakfast is the best !"}
{"text":"Yelp readers, have you shared in the collective experience of a broken heart where you feel that the world will never be the same, where you recall those vivid happy memories and think nothing will ever equal what you once had? Okay, so that was kind of me with Nick's.   Yet just as the heart will seek true love once more, so too did my stomach crave a breakfast that my equally emptied wallet could enjoy. Doubtfully, I looked to Nick's and thought, yeah but... it's not the same now.   And it isn't.   But it is.   The waitresses are friendly and efficient. The coffee mugs are mismatched but always filled. The portions are still mighty generous and inexpensive. The crowd is as mismatched as the dinnerware, but they too are always filled.   Because Nick's is the same as it was, despite a bit of a (some argue much needed) facelift. Perhaps I was sullen and selfish in wanting the dilapidation decor to dominate but man, something about the duct tape on the booths just did it for me and the hand painted whatever-that-mouse/cat-thing-was on the wall, yeah, it made me happy. Well, those are gone and on freshly painted mono-color walls hang large, locally produced, mixed-media art pieces. Does it change the whole vibe? Okay, I have to shrug and say I guess not so much as I'd feared. In some ways, maybe that disappoints me; everyone loves to be right after all.   So to the cooks and the servers above all else I say THANK YOU and PLEASE just please don't go changing to try and please us.... we like you just the way you are. For that, you should have a Billy Joel Skillet on the menu, don't you think?"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of Nick's. This is a great place to grab breakfast. I have heard Steve L. yammer on about how he is going to Nick's with his family for years now. My dad was in town from NY and I figured I may as well try the place that Steve L. and his pops break bread at. The art painted on the walls was one of my favorite aspects of the experience. I thought the food was decent. The price was right. I would rather walk out with a full belly and heavy wallet. An entire family could be fed at Nick's for the price of what a toddler could eat at Lucky's."}
{"text":"Since the business changed, I believe one of the co-owners relieved him/herself of their piece of the pie so to say, it has not been the same. Structurally sound employee staff seemed to turn into... I dont even know what? To the eye, I loved the Superhero paintings and comic book effect it had, now, its just a dark place. Food quality has stayed relatively the same, but I need more and better if youre going to change the whole scene like that.   Like I said I cant judge the business on looks, but the corn beef hash is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Something is going on at Nicks.    Half of the artwork is gone and the sign guy has marked up an entire wall.  If this is foreshadowing for an entire building mural...I'm loving it.  Aside from that, Nick's has great fare for a great price.  I typically order the Gyro omelets because the idea of Tatziki on eggs is pure heaven for me!  The omelets are huge and just bursting with meats and cheeses and whathaveyous.    It's a great place to hit up for a quick and inexpensive breakfast....and lunch, because typically I have enough to bring home for lunch."}
{"text":"I wanted some hangover food So I picked the 1st place I saw THIS PLACE IS YUMMY If I lived in Ohio City this would probably be my 'go-to' spot If I ever come back to OH, i would definitely visit! The decor is super cute too!!!"}
