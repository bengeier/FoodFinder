{"text":"Where do I begin..  This farm is full of wonderful people, tons of food options such as fresh veggies and fruits, home made jams, meat, cheese..chip truck!  Try Anna's Strawberry Jam.. sugar free or regular. Unreal. I have an aunt who visits from Northern Ireland almost every summer and always comes to the farm for a jar of banana jam to take home.  My fianc√© and I go for our bi weekly chip truck visit on Sundays. Their chips are unreal.. their poutine, the best around. You will not taste any better. Fresh pototoes, awesome gravy, nice staff working the truck.. amazing. Then we leave with a 50 pound bag of potatoes.  Pick some strawberries, stop for a poutine, sit and relax, grab a bag of potatoes and fresh veggies, grab a drink and head home.. perfect for a summer day!"}
{"text":"My wife had the poutine; fresh cheese curds, country style gravy, home cut fries that taste like real farm potatoes. She loved it ! I just can't stop thinking about those individually vacuum sealed cowboy steaks that cook so good on the grill. Pre-tenderized and marinated; just unreal flavour. Definitely worth the drive to Uxbridge."}
{"text":"I tried the poutine here today and I'm not sure what all the hype is about. Yes the potatoes are grown right there on the farm so they are supposed to be fresh. The fries I had didn't really taste fresh though. They have an odd texture where the outside is crispy but once you bite into it it's like air and the fry just collapses. Maybe the potatoes were dehydrated?? My husband said the same thing and we both really like French fries.   The actual place itself is nice. There are a lot of tables outside and there is also a small building where you can also sit and eat if the weather isn't great. They sell potatoes, pumpkins, pies, jams, and meats. It's family friendly and dog friendly."}
{"text":"I first heard about this farm from our realtor while we were house hunting in the nearby area. I'm a poutine fanatic so I couldn't wait to check out this place.  I opted for a regular poutine ($5) that includes farm fresh fries, real cheese curds, and delicious gravy. I thought the poutine was perfection and met my high expectations. Prices are great and the portions are big!  The atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly with an outdoor patio area for sitting and enjoying your food.  We also indulged in some pre-picked strawberries that were priced at $5/Quart. These strawberries were delicious and the best I've ever had.  Will definitely go back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Ive been going to Rose Farm for a few years now. Super friendly. Great place to sit, relax and enjoy an order of tasty fries. I like em straight and well done but if poutine is your thing then go for it.  You wont be disappointed.  Afterwards grab a tray of delicious butter tarts for desert.  This IS the Ontario of my childhood."}
{"text":"Visited the Rose Family Farm with my 5 year old son on his last day of school.  I don't think i was the only one to have that idea!  It was very quiet on a week day afternoon.  The two folk from the farm who I encountered were greatly helpful and told us where the best strawberries could be found that day.    We picked strawberries and everything was clean and well tended to.  I ended up buying some Strawberry jam and cheese as well.  They sell potatoes, onions and have a fry stand (probably for the weekends).  They have a full list of pies both fruit and meat based and a great selection of frozen meats available as well.  Parking is easy.  Great for groups."}
{"text":"We were driving by and I saw the large signs for Rose Family Farm. The signs mentioned some of the produce they were selling as well as fresh fries. The farm was easy to find thanks to the clear indications on the signs. It was lunch time when we got there so we decided to buy something from their chiptruck. We took a poutine with bacon. The poutine was a good size that my wife and myself shared. The fries were fresh (grown on their farm), and the curds, sauce and bacon were delicious. All that for 6$. After eating we went in the little store where they sell meat and baked goods from local farms. We bought marinated steaks, stuffed pork tenderloin and some pecan butter tarts. The tarts were delicious. We also bought some potatoes and corn that they grow on their farm. Overall the Rose Family Farm is a nice farm to get great fresh food. The staff was also very friendly and answered any questions we had. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, it's family owned and run farm. The farm strawberries and Yukon Potatoes .   The farm has pick your own strawberries or buy at the counter option. You can either bring your own basket or buy 1$ each basket. Berries are fresh and delicious. Farm is decent in size.   The potato sack is like 4$ for 20 pounds, fine quality.  They serve steak and freshly made fries and poutine onsite. There are a lot of picnic tables and garden furniture to sit and relax. Beautifully done.   Ample of parking spots. Love this place."}
