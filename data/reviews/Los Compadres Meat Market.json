{"text":"Great Mexican food! Feels just like home cook meals from mama :) and the prices are cheap too."}
{"text":"Best tacos and guacamole around! The market is no longer Los Compadres and is now La Herradero Meat Market. Like its predecessor, this is a family run business that emphasizes quality, portion and value.   Take it from me - the chicken tacos with chips and guac will knock your socks off!"}
{"text":"I came in to get some carne asada and it was good! I came in during Mother's Day and I was surprised to find not a lot of people in there. The meat was really good, I was even able to find rings that I haven't seen in years. Things that one can only find in their native country. They even had chamomile roots there. The checkout was quick and the girl who rang me up was very sweet and kind. Thank god for this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Best meat market The ranchera preparada is the best in town that I tried among everything else in meat !!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say other than omgness?! I love coming to this small grocere/bakery. My family totally loves the already marinated Carne Asada from here and I love the freshly baked breads and cakes they make here. Last time I flew back home to Hawaii, I bought $70 worth of Carne Asada, froze it and flew it home. My number one fix for mexican food."}
{"text":"Little market didn't know it was there until I Yelp it. They have a small market and bakery section. Cakes are a little expensive. But their spare ribs are amazing!!! We went back and got another 8 pounds to BBQ!! They also have cook items as well!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and craving good carne. Yelp to rescue. Found this spot and will be a customer for life. Great prices, and even better quality carne preparada. Great find!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy, burrito moly, best carne asada burritos hands down in town.   The meat is the most flavorful, tender meat ever. This is the only place we buy our meat for cookouts, I swear by it. It's affordable and delicious, get your butt down there now. It's a large burrito with fresh refried beans, tasty rice, sour cream, Mexican creamy cheese, and the carne asada meat. Only 5 bucks and worth every penny,   When I was pregnant this was my go to place to grub and get my addiction, aka craving. Yes, hardly anyone speaks English and men look at women like they're meat, but I can handle all of that for the award tasting food, lol   Writing this review reminds me that I need to go there sometime this weekend for one :)"}
{"text":"Greatest carne in town and great service!!! Always good.  Our house parties are popular mostly because of the \"carne.\""}
{"text":"I Love this tiny Mexican market!  They have the best marinated Carne Assad & Pollo Asada I've ever tasted  They also have a nice bakery and some great salsas with the perfect amount of spice! The guy behind the meat counter and girl at checkout stand we're both super friendly. Love this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went here to get carne asada for my daughters birthday party. Went there early it was pretty slow. I was helped very quickly and was in and out in 5 mins. I love the carne asada here it is marinated perfectly. We will always come here when we need good meat."}
{"text":"I wasn't real thrilled with our order. We ordered through grub hub so it was delivered to our door. I ordered a chimichanga with rice and beans. The only thing good was the beans. The chimi was covered in a gross cheese sauce ( never seen chimichangas with sauce before?)  I tried to wipe it off and eat it but couldn't ignore the nasty sauce taste. The rice looked and tasted a couple days old. It wasn't soft, but a little crunchy. Like stale.  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos for my fiance and i, they were disgusting. The tortillas were burnt & the meat was chewy and tough.  I dont eat Roberto's, but I'd eat there before I'd ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Where can you eat some of the best tacos in Vegas? My house, of course. But, I can't take all the credit. I bought the pre-seasoned and marinated meat for a recent BBQ at Los Compadres. The proteins purchased were pork chops ($2.49/lb), chicken breasts ($2.99/lb), and carne asada ($5.99/lb). The quality was great, all were easy to cook, chop up and serve in tortillas with all the toppings.  If your Spanish is no bueno, don't worry. They've got employees at this little Mexican market who speak English. The quality of their produce looked good, although prices were about the same (sometimes even more expensive) than what you would find at big chains like Albertsons or Smiths. I thought I'd save plenty of money by shopping here instead of those places, but I really didn't. I'll come back, though, to get my taco meat fix."}
{"text":"Great variety of fresh marinated meats available. They also have a hot food counter for your typical Mexican flare.  Love the pre-marinated meats tho! Always go back."}
{"text":"I haven't done a review in almost a year but I have to give a huge shout out to this lovely Marketa.  We actually have done almost 100% of our meat shopping here for the last 3 months. Their breaded chicken (Pollo) is perfect, pounded very thin with a nice breading is perfect for a quick meal after a long day at work. They have a good selection of made on premises sausages - we particularly like the Longaniza - which is similar to its Portuguese counterpart. I've been making my own al Pastore for years but since I've rediscovered La Herradero, Its no longer a 3-day process for special occasions for my family. Get at least 2 pounds weekly to make quick tacos.  We recently started getting premade food from their small but efficient kitchen. Their carnitas are divine.  We also like the carne asada, chili verde and their delicious pastries.    It's clean, most of the people speak English, they are kind and helpful. More than the surly folks at big box grocery stores."}
{"text":"This is a great little Mexican supermarket that i come to when I am craving some pan dulce. Their pastries are really good, love their conchas!"}
{"text":"Yum Fresh meat nice service great prices. What could be better? I wish there was one near my home!"}
{"text":"I've known this place as Los Compadres for years, it's now called La Herradero and the store has gotten bigger, but they still offer the same quality Panader√≠a, or Mexican bakery. Great breads variety, some of the best in town, always fresh, I usually drop by Saturday mornings on my way to the coffee shop and get an assortment of empanadas, orejas, etc. I seldom buy any grocery items, not enough to form an opinion."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service, quality of food is comparable to Del Taco. They had me waiting 30 minutes for an order of 4 chicken tacos that I could get at fuckin Taco Bell, all the old lady's that work behind the counter are standing around gossiping instead of making food. Go to the little Mexican restaurant right next to this place for a better experience."}
{"text":"They've got some of the best carne and pollo asada I've had in LV. Try their fresh chips and ceviche too. Registers right in front of the entrance/exit make it a little hard to get in and out."}
{"text":"By far the best carne asada tacos in town! The super burrito is insanely good! I also like to purchase the marinated chicken fajita meat for parties! Yum! I am a forever customer."}
{"text":"I been searching for a good Hispanic grocery store on this side of town and had no luck until I found this gem! The deals are amazing I bought so much groceries with only $50.00. I got fruits, vegetables, bread and so much more ! Everyone is so friendly will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great prices on meat, amazing selection of marinated and non-marinated meats. Great pastries if you like the sweet stuff. Super small but super authentic. Best Meat Market in town."}
{"text":"Nefasto el servicio de pasteleria y te quedan mal con lo que pide que se realize al pastel y  te piden la nota del pastel y luego no te la regresan fatal!! Muy mala experiencia"}
{"text":"We still keep going here for our carne asada but the prices have really cut down on the amount we purchase. We've been buying a lot more chicken, it's excellent as well, but when the carne is $1.50 more per pound than it is in CA it's definitely priced too high."}
{"text":"Los Compadres 2 is one of the best Mexican meat markets in town. Their prices are solid and their meat selection is even better. I recently just stopped in and picked up some al pastor and seasoned beef short ribs. Some of their meats come pre-seasoned which = just throw it on the grill and let the magic happen.   To bad this place is on the other side of town for me."}
{"text":"Great store. Great find in my area.  I needed to pick up some pan dulce for a \"Seis de Mayo\" party (guess everyone was busy on the fifth) and I checked good ol' Yelp for some advice.  I only picked up some pan dulce (which was very tasty and fresh). I look forward to checking out their meat market a little more since there are no large Mexican Grocers in my area. The prices were cheap too, I was very impressed and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"this is the worst place to go. The food they serve is expired, but on the ticket it shows today's day ."}
