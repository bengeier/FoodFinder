{"text":"This place is pretty interesting. It is a cafe/bar/music venue. I went here for a cup of coffee in the morning, and a cup of chai in the evening for their open mic night. The coffee is decent, but nothing spectacular. The chai was from concentrate, but still tasted good.

 Yet, the open mic night was pretty cool! Musicians who actually had some talent came up and performed. Jazz and Blues were the two main genres of the evening. It needs to hone in on what it wants to be, though. It seems like it is trying to be both bohemian and trendy, something admirable, but very difficult to pull off. Worth stopping in for if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've only been there once, so please consider that.  All I have to say is do not under any circumstances order one of their rice bowls.  They're gross.  There's no way that anybody working there ever tasted the one I ordered.  It was overpriced and nasty.   I would have been much, much better off buying a frozen Uncle Ben's one at a supermarket, running it over with my car, then heating it up with blowtorch. 

The place is cute.  The people working there seemed friendly.  The art in there is nice.  Hit up those awesome vending machines.  Just don't order a rice bowl.  Not ever."}
{"text":"Arts Collinwood has taken over the old Cafe Marika and is now operating The Cafe at Arts Collinwood in this space.

It's a little coffee shop / cafe with a tapas menu, soups, salads, a few simple desserts. They also serve beer! (Glorious beer!)

Stopped in the other night for something to eat when the Beachland was getting low on food (sold out show). I had some vegetable soup which was adequate and a pulled pork sandwich which was okay. I didn't have any coffee myself but I was told that it was good. The food is really just a little added extra to this place. It's not meant to be amazing. 

I'm glad this place exists for the simple fact that you can stop in to grab coffee late night if you're in the Waterloo hood. Also, it's yet another business that has popped up here. It's a comfy place with very friendly and cute staff. Very typical in what it offers and it deserves your business - so stop in the next time you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Coffee and booze? I'm listening...

This cute little cafe on Waterloo is truly one of a kind. It's attached to Arts Collinwood and offers up food, coffee, tea and yes--beer and liquor. 

So, just in case a speedball won't do the trick at midday, why not do a shot of whiskey? Totally kidding. But you could if you wanted to. 

The staff seems super sweet and I didn't try the food, but my iced tea was pretty tasty. I also really dug the vibe. There was a pretty random group of people in this afternoon and somehow I fit right in. 

If you're in the area, I definitely wouldn't skip this place. I'm hoping to see more businesses in this area as it continues to grow.

Oh, and I'll be reporting more the next time I head over there."}
