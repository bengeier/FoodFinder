{"text":"The drive over to Bonnie Springs from the west side of Vegas is super quick. My husband, son and I got there in no time. Twenty bucks for all of us to get in seemed pretty reasonable, and we thought we would use the ten dollar voucher for the restaurant that you get upon entry.

I know lots of people have given this place positive reviews across the internet, but there are some down sides to Bonnie Springs. My husband and I took our one year old to see the petting zoo, and we tried to take the stroller in, but it was VERY hard to maneuver over the gravel that was in the old west town. There are numerous wooden stairs everywhere as well. If you are in a wheelchair, be warned, this is a very non-handicapped-accessible location. I wouldn't bother.

They don't have many signs telling you exactly where the petting zoo is. You kind of have to wander around until you find the actual \"petting\" part. In actuality, there are very few animals loose to pet. At least when we went there was one goat, and a few very sleepy deer that were tolerant. The rest of the animals were behind cages (for safety sake, of course). All the animals seemed fairly well taken care of. There were a few cases where I question the animal's health, but nothing drastic.

We cut our losses and didn't try the restaurant. Since it's so close to Vegas, it was more appetizing to go back into town and grab something there. We didn't make the effort to see any of the wild west performances, either. It was hot and baby was tired.

I would say that overall we had a good time. I'm glad we gave the place a chance and checked it out. The animals did make my son smile, and there was a lot to look at, but I can't see going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place has 3 1/2 stars. We drove up here on a Sunday and paid the ridiculous $10/person and $7 for kids ages 1+ admission fee. First we walked through the petting zoo which had some unique animals, but not anywhere worth the admission fee. I'm not sure what else I paid for! The rest of the town is basically gift shops! The wax museum is the worst I've ever seen and only good for a few laughs. They even make you pay $1 to hear the Gettysburg Address at the \"Abraham Lincoln\" wax figure. Staff told us we weren't allowed to walk into the opera house or the buildings next to it. There's a small building with a bunch of old artifacts/junk thrown about that you can walk in a circle and admire. The sign \"experience the thrill of a crusher stamp mill in operation\" on another building means come in and admire a large piece of equipment with no signs explaining what exactly this is or how it works. Yes, what a thrilling experience to see a mill \"in operation\"! Why was there no employee on site in the middle of the weekend demonstrating how this equipment works?
The ONLY other buildings are a couple gift stores and a saloon. The saloon itself was beautiful inside, but a wasted space with a small counter serving cheap food. We walked through the  town for 20 minutes before realizing it was a terrible mistake to come and we left.

Please don't waste your time and money here! This place has potential, but is a complete joke. I'm not sure how it's still open and I wish I could get a refund!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place , my daughter dislikes feeding the animals she's very terrified of the little goats. She likes riding the train  she does enjoy  looking at the animals long as they don't get too close to her. The Wild Wild West Show they put on is great also."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of months ago and brought our daughter, I had no idea a lot of the animals were loose and just wandering around lol. It's a cool fun place if you dont mind walking around with a llama and deer following you :P"}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here on our day off and it was the perfect mix of outdoors fun and getting away from \"Vegas\" for awhile. We first went to the petting zoo! That was fun seeing and petting all the animals :) we walked around the small town, we missed the shows they put on but now we know for next time that they do shows.
After shopping around, we went to the restaurant. It's delicious and so cozy! The hostess/waitress was very nice and gave good descriptions of the menu. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was planning my wedding at Bonnie Springs. I had everything booked back in January 2014, I was told \"your time slot is marked off on our calendar\", and that i would be receiving a call 2 weeks before my wedding on April 12th to confirm everything. I was so excited, spent quite a bit to have invitations printed with their address, the date of the wedding, and the time. All of my friends and family were flying in accordingly.

I gave them a call on April 2nd 2014 because i was worried that i hadnt heard from them. I was told they would have to call me back with more information. I sat around and finally they called back. The woman i talked to told me that they had no record of my conversations with the woman i talked to back in january and that they didnt have me on their calendar whatsoever. Therefore, someone else had already booked my date and time.... 

Naturally i was upset, but it would have been easier to handle had the woman I spoke with on the 2nd been even slightly sympathetic. Your telling someone that their wedding fell apart completely 10 days before the ceremony and you cant even say the words, \"Im sorry\"? She was very rude, not offering any kind of explaination, or offering any kind of compensation for my wedding falling apart. In fact, she tried to raise the prices significantly higher than I was originally told back in April. 

Needless to say, we have found a different venue for the wedding. They lost not only a ton of income (40 people would have attended, spent the day there, rented hotel rooms there, eaten there, etc.), but they lost loyal regular customers. I will never return there or advise any of my friends/family to book events there in the future. Im just appalled by the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Went there for Bonnie Screams tonight which is their Haunted house experience.  It was the first night and not very busy but it was GREAT!!  The \"Old Mine Haunted House\" and \"Bloody Mary\" were both fantastic!  Had my wife's palms sweating and she screaming!  I am sure on the weekends it has more actors and is even scarier, but we had a great time just by ourselves!  Well worth the drive and $25 a piece!  The drive alone creeps you out because it is dark and desolate!  Have fun!"}
{"text":"I'm a ball of confusion... I want to give it more stars and I want to give it less stars.  I'm settling on 3.

Bonnie Springs has a lot of potential.  When I first started walking through the ghost town I was stoked at all the photo ops we were going to have.  I saw a sign saying \"wax museum\" and I started jumping up and down like a 5 year old.  But first, we had to run to make it to the melodrama and hanging.

You can tell the actors are giving it their best shot and that they actually care about the place... but the \"plays\" just weren't my cup of tea.  However, the third graders in the crowd were eating it up.  The melodrama is nice because you get to sit in the air conditioning and the hanging has some gun fights and explosions.  Don't expect much more than that.

After the shows, I was excited to explore the ghost town.  Unfortunately, everything was closed.  The ice cream parlor, the chapel, the wax museum I was dying to get back to. Major bummer.

Of course all the stores were open, but all they sold were trinkets you would find at a tourist trap in the middle of the Ozarks.  I'm talking \"Native American\" jewelry and dreamcatchers.  I wanted to get a bottle of water (can't take food or drinks inside), but decided against it when it was going to cost $2.50.

The petting zoo depressed me.  The animals look healthy and cared for, but they just stood there because they were too hot to move and had little to no shade to hide in.  Their cages were really small as well.  It could have been worse though; it's not as bad as the Las Vegas Zoo.

If this place got a bit of a paint job and they had everything open, it would have been a super fun time.  Everyone of the staff we dealt with was very friendly.  Little kids would love it here, but don't expect a lot to do.  We paid $7 per person."}
{"text":"i went with 2 friends from work and 2 children of one of my work mates to go on a 1 hour trail ride. We had a great time. 

The staff at the stables was excellent. They were confident, competent, and qualified. They were very concerned about the animals showing a lot of care (one had been riding since he was 5). They seemed to be enjoying their guests and the outdoors making chit chat and pointing out features of the trail. They were also great with my friends kids who hadn't ridden a horse (unless you count ponies in a ring guide). 

I was a bit afraid since I had a small incident as a child with a large pony who didn't want to be ridden and had been leery of horses since but the experience with this staff and the majestic horse they introduced me to, Grey Cloud, changed my feelings. I still have deep reverence for horses but I may have lost the edge of my fear out on that pretty trail.

my friends and i are already planning our next trip."}
{"text":"Such an experience of old western days. Take a carload of kids, esp little boys, throw in some grandparents and you have a mystical afternoon in the old west!"}
{"text":"Took my family here for a cheap fun day of exploring. I found that the ranch had a great concept, the little skits put on by the staff were adorable and interactive. (Cheesy type of comical, but I like cheesy) my youngest was a bit bored (4years) but my oldest enjoyed himself a bit more. 
The petting zoo was by far the coolest experience. Both of my sons had a blast feeding the sheep, baby deer, and goats. 
As far as the reminder of the ranch, it was a pleasant walk through the western style town, although there was nothing else to see, no shops worth stopping in, no restaurant, not even a feasible restroom facility. If they took the time and $ to develop the western town square into something a bit more refined this place could easily be a much better hit. But overall, for the cheap price and the smiles on my boys faces I'll give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you plan visiing this, be syre to do on a weekend.  Goind during the week costs the same, but only about half the park is operational."}
{"text":"There's a whole Lotta history here. I remember coming here is a child and having such an outstanding time. It's a great cheap place to bring your kids for a nice fun day. Don't miss out on the ghost town shoot outs. The restaurant isn't the best but it will do for lunch. Overall a fun experience for the money."}
{"text":"Spent a night prior to hiking. Friendly people and a nice saloon with good food. Not a Hilton but clean and just what I needed. Water smells like rotten eggs"}
{"text":"To me, everything that is neat and cool about Bonnie Springs is overshadowed by the fact that the entire place smells like animal shit. I'm not trying to be mean, it's just that there's a petting zoo, and horses, so......I'll pass on the hamburger. The duck pond in front of the restaurant is kind of icing on the scatalogical cake for me. 

A great place to grab a whiskey or a beer, but any appetite you had upon arriving will probably be gone once you start breathing through your nose."}
{"text":"Want to visit an old-west style town just outside of Las Vegas that also has a petting zoo? This is your place. Fun alternative to the hiking and recreation \"next door\" at Red Rock, neat little place to bring the family for the day. Pay attention to hours and attractions because some times they close early and you might find yourself driving out there with little time to spare."}
{"text":"Had a great time on the early morning trail ride! The horses all seemed to be in great condition and the guides were very friendly. They made sure my daughter was comfortable on the horse and found a great quiet horse for her to ride. She was the only child on the ride. The only comment I have is the guide was very flirty with the girls in front of us. It was a little more than I wanted my daughter to hear."}
{"text":"Great place, always puts me in a good mood. Have ridden here several times it's always awesome. The people are friendly and the horses are healthy. There's lot's to do, you can tell someone put a lot of time into this place to make it fun for everyone."}
{"text":"If you want to be harassed by unfriendly staff, this is the place to be! Not only do they want you to spend $70 bucks for breakfast and drinks for two, but they harass you and threaten to kick you out if you bring any outside snacks for your kids! And don't worry, the staff will be there to watch you every minute until you put snacks away. And if you need help they are more than happy to waste public funds to call law enforcement."}
{"text":"very interesting.. i liked it and so did the kids. good for a nice cool day out for the family. id go back and do it all again."}
{"text":"I had a HORRIBLE time with Bonnie's Ranch. Not because of the animals but because of the MANAGEMENT. I was with two girl friends for a nice relaxing vacation away from the strip. April, the owner of the ranch accused my friend of being pregnant because she was (at first) hesitant to sign a waiver. When we tried to reason with her she said, \"i'm not doing this\", walked away, and tried to avoid us the whole time we were there. She then tried to split our party up by saying weren't getting our money back and that we had to participate! Excuse me? you just made my friend cry by your passive aggressive, mediocre, managerial skills and is now trying to split us apart from her by threatening us? 

what was once a really lovely back story to the ranch has now turned into a money hungry establishment with horrible customer service. There are other ranches that can and will treat you better. Go to them!"}
{"text":"To all the people complaining about the prices and then go on to complain about the conditions the animals are in... where do you think the money for the care they do get comes from? Do you have any idea how expensive it is to take care of all of those animals? How much vets cost? food? water?

They are always accepting volunteers to help with the animals and DONATIONS which they desperately need to help provide quality care for all of the animals and upgrade all of their enclosures. They are now a non-profit and really need everyone's support.

Feel free to apply as a volunteer or donate to the animals. It would make for an even better experience for everyone (including the animals!!!!!)

Donate or volunteer for the animals!"}
{"text":"Worth for horse back riding

A beautiful scenery, a bar, on the style of old west, where the food you get is also on the same style: authentic, but not the most healthy!! :-)

The horse back riding trail is really nice and enjoyable. The horses are gentle and the cowboys (and cowgirls) are friendly.

The scenery is beautiful. You feel like in a Hollywood-painted landscape!

I definitely recommend, even more as a contrast to Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  We went during the Wednesday of school vacation week in April 2009.  The kids were excited to ride the train out front -- sorry kids, the train only runs on Saturdays and Sundays.  Let's go into the western town and look around. Hey a western coin-operated Shooting Gallery -- let's give it a try.  Nope, every single of the 12 guns is broken. So why open the door of the Shooting Gallery to customers? Although, there's a big sign that says \"No Flash Photography\".  Is that a hint to try it?  I mean, it's not good for anything anyway. We tried the flash.  It set everything off and scared the kids out of their pants. There is also a Mining Wax Museum ... oh wait, it's permanently closed.  All attractions in Old Nevada were either closed or broken. We saw a hanging.  It was done with stupid humor (bad jokes, bad acting) -- not a laugh in sight.  Most stores were open. Many of the western structures in town seemed dilapitated and closed.  Were they condemned?  Did the original owner die and the kids continue to run the place putting no money back into it?   Oh great, they rebuilt the wedding chapel, but the door was kept locked.  We saw an office of 3 workers running the place.  We laughed.  Running what?  The only saving grace was the petting zoo.  The kids were happy to see the animals -- thus the one star.  Otherwise zero stars.

The only good thing is the price @ $20 a car load  -- we had 7 people.  At least they keep this waste of time affordable.  Thankfully we were in Red Rock Canyon earlier and it wasn't much of a drive."}
{"text":"Fun for the whole family! Petting zoo, live shows, bar/restaurant, and all of the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"The restuarant had delicious food, and the best biscuits with butter I have ever had. Warm and soft on the inside, and crispy on the outside. Our waitress was able to take our orders (which were complicated) and not have to write it down. Good service, will eat here again."}
{"text":"Last Sunday my fiance our son and myself took a drive up to Bonnie Springs. We took our son to the petting zoo. He had an amazing time. He loved all the animals. That was our high light of the day. We decided to grab a bite to eat in the restaurant which was an awful experience. We were seated near their POS system and I'm guessing by the way this lady talked to the employees she was the manager (hair in a bun and braces) I have never in my years in the serves industry heard a manager speak to employees the way she did also over hearing her talk about the customers was completely unprofessional. I understand being in the industry is tough and chaotic at times but she should be careful where she says things and how loud they are said. I will return only to take my child to the petting zoo and to visit the bar."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs is a fun family day trip. You'll see scenic Red Rock Mountains, train ride, cute little petting zoo, and lots of Joshua Trees. My favorite part of the trip are the burro's around the front entrance. I was able to take some great photography at this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Everyone that worked there was verry nice and soo funny. There were peacocks everywhere and they were all so pretty.  I went on the 5 mile horse ride which took about an hour and it was so fun!!! All the horses are well trained and were under control at all times. Just listen to what the workers teach and all will go smoothly."}
{"text":"I am only going to review part of this place.  Because I haven't got to explore the whole place.  The restaurant and bar at Bonnie Springs is a great hidden gem.  I lived in Vegas for 7 years and I never knew this place existed, and now I am mad at myself.  The bar has really great prices on the beers and plus they serve sarsaparilla for anyone who doesn't want an adult beverage.  The food is tasteful and good portions.
Another thing about this place is that they do a ghost adventure at night.  We got to participate in this wonderful experience.  And it was very informative.  Its a definite must do."}
{"text":"I cant. say enough about this place. I have always stayed on the strip but this time we decided to take the dog and stay at this place a close friend recommended. The room was very clean, with a kitchen too, the staff there were more than friendly making sure all of our needs were met. The train, petting zoo, restaurant were all very nice and all the staff were made you feel right at home. We are for sure going back and stay as it makes going to Vegas so much  fun.  5 star casual relaxation for sure!"}
{"text":"Before I give my review I want to say that barring any overly horrid experience here I will always come back. I like being able to get out of town and hide out without driving too far. This is for the dining only. 
I find the food to always be satisfactory \"lodge\" food. The bison burger and pulled pork sandwich never disappoint. The service is average. I usually wait longer than most places, but everything seems cooked to order so I'm okay with the wait. I find them to be overpriced for the value of the food. 
The thing that kills me about this place is their bathrooms are always a horror show. Maybe if they had an employee check the conditions every hour it would help, as it usually looks like they haven't been attended for 7-10 days. I've learned to avoid them, but during my last visit on 12/29 I escorted my daughter to the bathroom and it looked like a party of rats and germs had a big throw down.  I had to take a pic as words don't do it justice. Here's hoping the kitchen gets better attention for cleanliness."}
{"text":"We visited in July while on a family trip to Lake Mead.  My 8 year old daughter has been riding horses for nearly 3 years and loves to go on trail rides as a family whenever we travel.  I have to say this was our best experience yet.  Beautiful scenery and great guides.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. It was so bad I asked for, and was denied, a refund. Behold, the email I sent management concerning our terrible experience:

\"My husband and I visited Bonnie Springs almost ten years ago and had happy memories, so this past weekend when we were in town visiting we decided to take my brother and sister-in-law and their daughters (5 years old and 3 months old). Unfortunately, we felt that the quality has severely declined since our first visit to Bonnie Springs. Specifically:

* There were only three animals available to pet in the petting zoo (all deer). We saw one goat napping in the shade, and all the rest - ponies, etc. - were fenced in and unreachable.

* The deer were extremely aggressive. I couldn't even get the food that I paid for - they all shoved me out of the way and it fell to the ground. I grew up around horses and cows and I know how to stand my ground around pushy animals, but this was above and beyond. A little girl got bit right when we walked in, and that combined with the deers' pushiness made it so my niece was too scared to go near them.

* The deer did not look healthy. One even had a gory open sore on his hind end.

* There were employees raking the pens when we were there, emitting unhealthy clouds of dust and feces all around us (we left much sooner than we would have otherwise for this reason. We felt like we'd been chased out.) 

* We were excited to see the wax museum, but the person at the front desk didn't make it clear when we asked about it that it was guided tours only. We were disappointed to see that it was locked up. Also, when we arrived we asked when the shoot-outs happened and were told that the next one was a couple of hours in the future (later than we intended to stay). We took our time as we entered the park, looking in shops etc., then when we got to the top of the street we realized the shoot-out had just ended and that we could have caught most of it had we been informed when we bought our tickets that it was in progress.

Plus sides: The location is just beautiful (we saw burros on the way in!), and we did really enjoy the turtle pond, even though a machine ate my quarter : (


Thanks for your time,

Jessie Jensen\"

AND AFTER ALL THAT, THEY REFUSED TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. $47 I'll never see again. Poor, poor, poor experience. Save yourselves!!!"}
{"text":"Great day trip for kids from Las Vegas. There's a train that runs from the parking lot to the entrance on weekends.  It's free from the parking lot but if you want a ride back you have to dine at the restaurant or buy tickets.  Which are inexpensive and then you get unlimited train rides all day.  The conductor is sweet as can be. 
The petting zoo is nice. The animals are friendly and I didn't see them bite any tiny fingers that were trying to feed them. 
The melodramas are super cheesy but fun for the kids and all the employees are very friendly. 
The only downfall is the restaurant. Bad service and very poorly prepared frozen food.  I've tried it three times just in case and every time was terrible.  That's why the 4 star rating not 5. 
The weather is typically cooler than Las Vegas cause it's at the base of picturesque Red Rock Canyon. Absolutely gorgeous photo opportunities.
The owners should start an annual pass program for locals."}
{"text":"Waste of my time and money. Took the kids out there the other day. What a disappointment. I will echo  most of the other poor reviews of this place - old, dilapidated, and depressing. Yes I get that it is the \"old\" west but the wax museum was pitiful...half of the figures had no lighting, missing fingers etc from age. It costs $1 to hear the hokey Abe Lincoln say the Gettysburg address but you only have 15 minutes to get through there because that's all time it is open. The petting zoo was the kids favorite part. It was OK... unique collection of chickens. Definitely not worth $10 a person.  Anyone who has been to other ghost towns would not rate this very high. I think a lot of people who grew up going here must be giving it a nostalgia rating of 5. Just no..."}
{"text":"Kind of reminds us of either Knott's Berry Farm's Old West town or Calico Mine, but it was a really cute place.  The Melodrama and \"Hanging\" were really corny, but also well done.  The young men, did a great job making sure everyone (young & old) had a good time.  The Wax Museum was filled with great antiques.  The price was very reasonable ($10 for adults, $7 for kids ages 1-12).  They've got fun cut-outs to take pictures with so that was fun.  We (a group of 7 adults) had our photos taken at the Old Tyme Photos place.  They turned out fantastic!  The mountain scenery was a perfect location for those black & white photos!  We bought the disk to share (only $40 for 15 pictures)....now we can each print out what we want.  The petty zoo is worth while, but the deer EAT your clothing so be aware of that.  Would HIGHLY recommend because it was affordable, fun, and was a great way to see more of Nevada than just the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"What a fun and lovely place to spend the day. The petting zoo was our favorite. Come early. Although we came to ride the train, but we were there on a Thursday. The train only runs during the weekends. The melodrama show was pretty cheesy, yet funny, after the show, we watched the hanging in the middle of the road. 
As far as horseback riding; the minimum age for a child is 6. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential but a its current state its not worth the admission fee. the petting zoo was cruel and depressing, the animals didn't have enough water and not enough shade for the heat of Vegas. It seemed to me that the animals were not in the best shape. In my opinion the habitats for the animals could have been bigger."}
{"text":"We've been bringing our grandsons out here for several years. They love to ride the train and feed the ducks. We've only had breakfast, which is great. We're planning on coming out for dinner some night soon."}
{"text":"I grew up in Las Vegas a long time ago, and Bonnie Springs was always a fun little getaway. After 30-odd years away, I'm glad to see it's still around and it hasn't changed much. The restaurant has the best bbq you'll find outside an actual chuck wagon - ribs, chicken, bison, elk, and the most authentic baked beans anywhere. The western town still has a melodrama, regular shootouts, hangings, wax museum, and a petting zoo. It's a hidden gem nestled in the red rock foothills and so worth the visit."}
{"text":"The $20. Carload Fee  not mandatory?it  was if u want to ride the little train around the town u can pay.
What a NICE day it was!lots to do for ALL ages (petting zoo,train)cute shops,ice cream parlor...etc...
And the show was AWESOME! It runs ever sat & sun till Aug.the name if it is Old Western revue. Also great for kids too!
They do Songs for them,interaction,and jokes that are ALITTLE over their head (good for us)
Nice to spend a day away with no gambling
Also....burrows walk around the town freely!
Lots of animals walking around the petting zoo."}
{"text":"What a fun place! I hope everyone supports small ghost town businesses. The charm and down to earthy ness is solid gold. A good place to take a date or your family out of the constant hustle bustle on the strip. Coolness factor is off the charts! Also a really cool bar and restaurant serving just some solid home cooking. They also have re-enactment shows on the weekends and a mini train as well, but the Zoo and bar restaurant are open during the week. Well worth a trip if you love the American West and ghost towns in general. There is also a retro motel attached to the property, now know that this isn't four star amenities motel, but if you need a bed to sleep after drinking at the bar. It'll do. Weekends $10 cover for adults and $7 for the Zoo and mini train ride."}
{"text":"This is such a fun and unique place to take the kids! They have a petting zoo with unique animals: yes, the deer wouldn't stop following us around. When we walked in, thought this wasn't even going to take an hour; however, stayed for three! Their shows were fun and entertaining for the adults and the kids. The third show was great because it taught gun safety for the little ones (basically if you see one go get an adult). Just a good clean time to go hang out and enjoy."}
{"text":"I love the bar here they are so nice and fun. I love horse back riding too. Fun place to see animals."}
{"text":"Restaurant/bar, banquet/event center, petting zoo,and ghost town tour!  This is such a unique place and a hidden gem out in no man land!  We were invited to Bonnie Springs to help celebrate a friend's birthday party with dinner and a ghost hunt experience that was located onsite.  

First off, don't be turned off by the smell of the place, they have a non-profit petting zoo for children along with some kid friendly activities.  To get pass the smell, I just stuck my nose into my scarf until we walked into restaurant area.  Once inside, it was cozy and down to earth with a reminder of being home (aka, not in Vegas).  Drink prices were reasonable and the food was delicious!  Once you are seated, order taken, drinks set, they bring out the homemade mini loaf bread smother in butter!  Yum!!!  

I order the BBQ chicken (see picture), which is half of a chicken with sides.  I'm not a huge beans fan but the beans were good with a bit of sweetness and a hint of smokiness,  Biscuit was warm, soft and chewy!  Corn kernel was nicely seasoned, so salt or pepper was needed.  I was so full, I didn't get to the beets but my husband stole them and told me they were sweet and salty...not sure if that's a bad thing...lol!

The venue has a nice fire pit located in the center of the front restaurant, where friends can gather around to chat and drink!  They also have tons of space in the back for private event along with an actual event center (aka the Salon Bar), located in their ghost town, behind the restaurant.

Once we were done with dinner, we walked into their ghost town to start our adventure.  Elite Vegas Paranormal Society ran the ghost tour, providing \"ghost buster\" tools to seek out the paranormal.  It was a fun 3 hour tour with a couple of strange paranormal activity; one possession and one ghost conversation caught on a recorder!  I wouldn't believe it myself except I as there witnessing it myself.  They said that was a quiet night for them!  It was a fun experience and certain worth going back to explore again.

Not just the ghost tour but the whole ranch!  Food was good, atmosphere was friendly and activities are abundant !  Great venue to throw a huge party or a small gathering!"}
{"text":"It was okay. The \"actors\" left a lot to be desired. They were a bit unprofessional and one of them called their skit lame on stage to the audience.
The place has a cool concept but seems a bit run down. The wax figures are truly creepy. I don't know if we would ever go back. During the week the train does not run and that was one of the main reasons our family was there. My toddler loves to ride on a train."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here, and they seem to have added a few things since the last time we were here, about 3 yrs ago.  Once you walk though the gate, it feels like your in a real western town, and some of the buildings have original pieces, and even a few buildings shipped in from other towns.  Not a lot of touristy stuff which is nice.  The petting zoo is great for all ages, donkeys, deer, sheep, goats all walking around, as well as some amazing animals in pens.  They all look well fed & cared for.  Parking was easy, but on dirt, so make sure to be careful when walking around since its uneven ground.  Pretty cool place to visit.  The Opera House is only open here & there, mostly during the week, and you have to asked if you can take a tour--probably worth it though since it's been said to be haunted."}
{"text":"poor animals don't look good at all! :("}
{"text":"Old, not kept up.   Animals in the zoo look very unhappy and don't have a great place to live.  Live show was just awful and unfunny.
Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I love it here! Its a great place to go with the kids. They have a petting zoo. A restaurant, horseback riding, activities for the kids and a train ride to get on. The view is amazing nice to get away for a while from the crazy city life. And the staff are really friendly"}
{"text":"My family and I just went to Bonnie Springs. Now when I was little I went and loved it, it was so nice. But now its a waste of money! The staff is very very friendly though. The 4 min train ride I believe was the best part of the whole trip. They only had a few things open which was mostly the stores. The main and best part the wax museum was closed and didn't look like it has been open for awhile. The zoo was the worst part, it was very nasty. Most of the animals just was around, the smell was unbelievable, the goats will eat at your clothes while the staff (if there is a staff member around) will do nothing to stop them. The animals have a small pond of very dirty water, and the turtle there had a million and 1 flies around it. The cages were very nasty. I think the zoo should be shut down due to health concerns not only to the animals but the customers as well. Overall Bonnie Springs is not worth $10 per adult and $7 per child at all. I would've just rode the train 20 times if it wasn't for my children."}
{"text":"It is was a lot of fun with great people .  We saw a hanging, shoot out show and toured the zoo.  The west town was really cool.  If you go make sure you go to restaurant and get the bison burger."}
{"text":"During our last day in Las Vegas, as we were struggling for something laid back to do , one of the members of our group suggested that we check out Bonnie Springs, an old mining town turned animal sanctuary just outside of the Las Vegas suburbs. Being deathly afraid of horses, and knowing full well that Bonnie Springs was covered with them, I was initially not very excited about the idea. However, after being told of a number of historical buildings located on the property, I reluctantly decided to go along with the idea.

Unfortunately. upon my arrival I found out that out of all the buildings in their mining town, only one or two were actually originals, the rest being reproductions made for a wild west show Bonnie Springs hosts a few times a week. In addition, many of the buildings seemed to have been retrofitted for present day use, which seemed to take away from their historical value. However, although I was disappointed by this aspect of Bonnie Springs, I was pleasantly surprised by their small, but interesting petting zoo. Although many of the animals weren't \"rare\" by any stretch of the imagination, they did a few cool animals such a a snow lynx.

Overall, I had an enjoyable time at Bonnie Springs, and was able to survive without being trampled by any horses. Even so however, I doubt I would return to this attraction if I found myself in Las Vegas again. However, I would still recommend Bonnie Springs to any families looking for a friendlier experience than what a family with young children would find on the Strip."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The shows were corny but funny. Cute little zoo. But the workers were very hospitable and friendly. Even when one of them was flipped off by a gentleman who was full of himself lol They answered all my questions and even those of my very curious 6 year old. Mr. \"Angry\" Joe was so kind to give a small tour of the wax museum to my daughter to help ease her fear. And I had a pleasant conversation with the young lady who worked at the store in front of the zoo. Its employees like yours that make a vacation memorable. We will surely be back to visit when we come back to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"don't be scared away from bonnie springs by the other reviews, take this place for what it is worth, it does not cost just to get in and walk around. if you are with adults go into the bar and have a beer, the bar is cool. take your kids they will think this is the coolest place in the world even though you think it is kind of dumpy. please go to this place and spend some money. they are having tough times and are going to have to shut down. there is no old charm in las vegas anymore, you all know what i am talking about, something gets old they just knock it down and build new junk. if bonnie springs closes it will just be another piece of history gone."}
{"text":"Nice little get away from the city. Our babies loved it!"}
{"text":"A blast from the past. Perfect for kids and a really unique experience. Had a wonderful time at the petting zoo and the western town / hanging show is fun. Awesome to check out at least once. Definitely won't be your average Sunday. Oh and the restaurant has a MEAN bison burger. Ask for it a little rarer then usual, they cook it well done"}
{"text":"My two boys, 9 & 10, my mom and I went to Bonnie Springs a couple of days ago.  We had a great time! My kids thought the shows were funny. We especially liked the petting zoo. While we were there we met Bonnie. What a sweet old ladie. You can tell she really cares about the animals. I recommend getting away from typical Vegas and visiting this little gem while you still can. Bonnie is in her 90's and it will probably change a lot when she's gone."}
{"text":"Bonnie Screams this year is way better then before/went Sunday don't want to ruin it for people but it's Good. fun started before we even got wristbands with the headless horseman outside, if your going dress warm it was cold and get ready for fun. if you can go when it's not so crowded it's way better."}
{"text":"I was visiting a couple of months ago and was shocked by the condition of the petting zoo and the grounds in general.    Stay away."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places in Vegas to go wether you have children or not! I took my younger brother and his friends here for his 19th birthday and on another occasion with Jason, and everyone has always had a really good time. 

We always start off at the petting zoo, and I suggest you bring a pocket full of quarters to feed the animals. You can get them from the restaurant, but it seems like they get really annoyed and it's a bit of a wait to get change. Bring a camera, you'll want to capture these memories. You might also want to consider having baby wipes on hand as the hand washing station can be fussy.

Next we take a trip through the town; this is another place to capture some really adorable photos. They also have a show in front of the \"Town Hall\" every couple hours, which they will tell you the schedule for when you purchase your tickets. 

Finish off heading over to the gift shop, where we picked up a raccoon hat (because no young man can turn 19 without one!). He wore it cosmic bowling that night, and all the young ladies were.. how you say \"all over his nuts\". I thought it was amusing that the simplest of things can get so much attention. 

Worth the small price tag. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do in Las Vegas is to come here. So many things to do and it gets you out of the city!! I tell everyone they have to come here because there is nothing like this. Of course you must like animals, the Wild West and a little bit of dirt."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for visitors of all ages! I visited the restaurant, museum and petting zoo. Your ticket helps support the animals and it's a great place to go an unwind. If you like to ride horses, that's available too!! Definitely check it out for an afternoon of old fashioned fun!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a break from Vegas for a day (or even just a couple of hours), Bonnie Springs Ranch is just a bit further than Red Rock- and possibly a better option if you have kids.  Chickens, roosters, peacocks, and other critters are running freely around the area, so if you don't like animals, this is not the place for you.

The first thing you'll see as you walk up is the restaurant- you can grab a meal there first and bring your $25+ receipt to the ticket booth for admission. Once inside, you're free to tour the small western town, complete with a shooting gallery, various live shows/plays, a mining area, a chapel, a saloon, and a gift shop. This section is not particularly well-maintained and despite employees walking around in character, only one was actually engaging with guests. I wish they'd update a bit and do some repairs to keep this place engaging for youngsters over age 7.

But the best part of all is the petting zoo. I drive out here just to visit those guys. The enclosures are rustic but the animals mostly look fairly clean, healthy, and happy. Take a couple of quarters for the food machine and watch the animals flock to you!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about nature and a property like this that sits on the foothills of Red Rock Canyon.

Bonnie's story is a beautiful one and she loves animals and takes great care of them making sure everyone is cared for and fed well. There's also lots to do here ~

Animal zoo (perfect for kids or adults who are still kids inside)
Awesome rustic restaurant & bar
Motel (haven't stayed here yet but will very soon)
Train (great for kids - short ride from parking lot to town)
Western town (super cheesy but sometimes I'm into cheesy)
Horseback riding (AMAZING experience)
Lots of animals (ducks, peacocks, chickens, roosters, burrows, horses, mini horses, a bull, and all sorts of other ones in the little zoo)

Don't expect something fancy here and this isn't like other large zoos. It's small, super cute and a little run down but what matters most is that it's an animal sanctuary and this part is very well maintained. 

Highlights worth doing - the horseback riding trails are stunning! You get closer to the mountains & it feels like you're hundreds of miles away from town. Loved every second of our ride. The restaurant & fireplace area - perfect for a quick bite or sitting and relaxing by the large fireplace. I also loved the zoo part because there are many animals walking around freely waiting for you to pet them & give out some treats. (Treats can be purchased on location) 

It's a fun time to get away from town and feel like a kid again."}
{"text":"not what i expected, just know that if u go to just walk around and not purchase anything the train wont take u back to ur car."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs is a great place to get out of Vegas. Its one of my favorite places for  Sunday morning breakfast. All the bartenders and other employees are top notch, except one. Today I had the displeasure of meeting Tim. Tim is the single rudest person I have ever meet who works with the public. From the the start of our interaction with Tim it was so over the top I thought he was one of the actors, but no he was just being rude and raising his voice.  I swear if I didn't know better he wanted to start a physical fight with me and my girlfriend. I hope this review doesn't stop anyone from going to this great family attraction, but Tim needs to go, he casts a ugly shadow on a other wise great experience."}
{"text":"A nice little get away from the strip. The drive is beautiful, but make sure you come when the weather is nice...been here when it's hot and the last time it was 27 degrees. So make sure it's a nice day since 99% of it is outside.  There really isn't much to do, a small zoo type area and some old buildings.  All in all its worth the trip with the family!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful place to visit, works well for everyone singles,children,or couples. So much to look at and the horse back riding scenery is just phenomenal. I did not catch the western show, wax museum, or petting zoo, but  customers walking out seemed pleased. Went on Sunday( New Years Eve) nice crowd. $60.00 per person for a guided hour ride. No appointment needed. Saw some wildlife!"}
{"text":"I'm glad i didn't read these reviews before we went to Bonnie Springs Ranch. (BSR) Some of these reviews seem unlikely and over-exaggerated. We had never been to BSR and one of my coworkers suggested that we take our 4 y/o since she likes animals. We had been to red rock on several occasions but never knew that BSR existed. The main Rd. in Red Rock is paved but the Rd. to BSR is not. There are two area to park, one close to the front and one a little further back allowing you to ride the  mini train to the front. (our daughter really seemed to enjoy the train ride) 

Ticket prices are pretty reasonable. $10 per adult and $7 per child. If you plan on going I suggest you check their times and the weather. (temps tend to be 5-10 degrees cooler at red rock then in town.) http://www.bonniesprings.com/index.php?id=1
You can pay as you drive up( cash only) or at the gate.(debit, visa, master card)
Keep in mind this is a ranch/ petting zoo there are animals its gonna smell, so be prepared.

Once inside their is a mini western town with several \"shows\" throughout the day. keep in mind these shows are geared towards your children. they are not elaborate and they are cheesy. There is even a wax museum of sorts. I did feel that this attraction was a little rushed, but overall not bad. There are also several gift shops with a variety of gifts to choose from. They even have western style portraits available. keep in mind that if you decide that you don't like the photos there is a $15 sitting fee. (Don't worry if you are nice and say your not satisfied with the photo they will offer to retake the photo prior to printing.)

As far as the petting zoo goes keep in mind most of these animals are rescue animals. Most are not very pretty and have scars. None of the animals seem to be miss treated, even if some are a little over weight. 

There is a restaurant on site and the ranch does offer pony rides at a fee.( pony rides were not available the day we went) They also offer horse back rides to the base of the mountain. (please take minute to look over the restrictions prior to booking) 

Overall our family had a nice day out , BSR is nothing fancy but its def family friendly and easy on the pocket book."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem!!!

I was pleasantly surprised with Bonnie Springs! To be honest I've lived here nearly 7 years and was unfamiliar with it. Glad I found it.

I came here on a Monday, when the town was dark. It was ok though because it was still accessible, just the stores and attractions were locked up. It was still cool to see though.

We did make it into the petting zoo, which was a blast! Make sure to bring lots of quarters! There's some hungry Deer and Goats! There was a variety of animals, most of whom are allowed to roam freely. The llama whose name I don't remember, clearly didn't like me, as he spit on me twice! Lol! 

All in all it was a great trip and I'll be back. Next time I will visit the restaurant, hotel and maybe the saloon!"}
{"text":"100% haunted. The zoo is small but cool. The food and service was great. I first came out here to get away from the city, by doing some horseback riding.. I had a blast..then did some ghost haunting, with permission of course. I was with my 17 yr little brother. We heard footprints and little girls voice... We then heard it calling are names. We screamed like little girls..bring a voice recorder."}
{"text":"I remember having visited this place as a child sooo many years ago. It was a fuzzy memory in my mind and I had long forgotten the name of the place. One day while telling my boyfriend about my childhood experience he did some research and found it. We of course had to go. About every weekend we go hiking up at Red Rock and I had no idea how close I was to this adorable little ghost town! We decided to dedicate a whole day to it and were quite looking forward to the petting zoo. I wasn't sure what to expect as it had been so many years since I last visited. 

We decided to stop by the restaurant first and have a quick bite. We both ordered the buffalo burger. MMMMMMmmmmMMMMM! It was so good. Our table was overlooking the duck/turtle pond outside. A  beautiful view, a wonderful and attentive server, and delicious food. Today was going to be a great day! After eating we took a little walk outside and observed some of the animals that were roaming the property. 

After walking off some of the food we went and got tickets to get into town. The ghost town was very cute. I don't know why I've read some reviews complaining about this. It is a GHOST town, not a state of the art modern play ground. The rustic look was what we were seeking in this place and that is what we got! There are so many things to look at and fawn over while waiting for the next show. 

The petting zoo was nice too. It was rather fun seeing all the animals and the paying for the kibble out of the old bubble gum dispensers. Making friends with the llamas and goats was quite fun. There were a few caregivers about watching the animals and guests and we were lucky to be there at a time where the animals were getting their feeding. It was very fun watching them get all excited about lunch! We will definitely be back with friends that have kids."}
{"text":"I visited Bonnie Springs when they turned it into 'Bonnie Screams' for the month of October. I will admit that the place looked a bit old fashioned and dirty (The parking lot was dirt and gravel) but hey, that's what was to be expected right? :) We went to the ticket booth which also doubled as a gift shop. It had neat Glow swords and such.  So, the prices were a bit pricey than was thought($25/person) but the $2 off Coupon was a little helpful in relieving the sting in of our wallets. 

So, the six of us went up the steps and embarked the 'Haunted' Bonnie Express. It was a neat train ride and had some 'outside visitors' grace us with their presence. It was so dark that I had thought someone fell or jumped off the train but it was only a  person in a black cloak appproaching my seat. Once off the train we were initially greeted by some make-uped(is that even a known word? :)) actors but once inside the town, did the atmosphere envelope our eyes and ears. The town was dark, but not too dark to not see where you were going for there were nice 'Halloween' lights and lighted Decor. Hehe, we didn't know what to do, initially, so we thought it was a good idea to check out each 'Store' in the haunted town and so we took a right. We were upon the first door proceeded to open it, though visibility was practically none. it looked to be an arcade shhoting range where you shoot moving 'still' targets. We didn't more than a foot into the room when we were greeted by and old zombie and a younger zombie, shaking their heads, hand-gesturing to get out all the while grunting as they did so. I liked how they stayed in character. :)

So, we proceeded then, knowing that we couldn't just walk into any building, onward and it felt upward. The music took a little discerning but I recognized it to be from Nox Arcana(Which is good haunting music personally speaking ;)). There were a total of I believe three(3) 'Haunted Houses'. Phobia was nice at the end, where we had to squeeze through between two lengthy inflated walls. It was truly not for the claustrophobic. But the best one I must say, was the one with the longest line. I apologize for not remembering what it was called, but it was the one where you were in a cave and immediately the walkway began to tilt. It was also the lengthier one but I truly enjoyed the 'Trail of DOOM' that was a part of the same experience. We even saw a goat along the way! We had tried to take some pictures to document our trip out there, but the ones within the town were practically useless due to all the dust in the air that resembled 'orbs', for those of you who are into the paranormal. ;)

Our evening was coming to a close. Sure there were snack bars and even a bar and restaurant, and a beer indeed sounded good, we started our night late around 9:30 and they only kept it open till 12am. Still this was a most enjoyable experience and would recommend anyone to give the 'Bonnie Screams' a check-out, at least once."}

{"text":"Wildwest-Kulisse in der Nähe von Las Vegas

Wer von Las Vegas etwas Ruhe braucht und ein wunderschönes Ausflugsziel für Naturliebhaber kennenlernen möchte, der kommt am \"Red Rock Canyon\", nicht vorbei.

Nachdem wir die abgesperrte 20 km lange Panoramastraße (Scenic Drive durch das Naturschutzgebiet) des wieder verlassen hatten, haben wir noch einen Abstecher zur \"Bonnie Springs Ranch\", unternommen. Dort wollten wir -gemäß Werbung- in einer echten Wildwest-Kulisse, unsere Westernträume wahrwerden lassen.
Die Ranch ist eine Nachbildung einer authentischen 1880er Bergbaustadt, mit Strei-chelzoo, ein Wachsfigurenmuseum, einer Western-Eisenbahn, einem Motel mit Restaurant etc. An den Wochenenden sollen auch Live-Unterhaltungen 
(Food, Fun & Entertainment for the whole family) durchgeführt werden.
Leider hat sich dieser Abstecher für uns nicht gelohnt, da hier schon alles sehr in die Jahre gekommen ist und während unserer Anwesenheit nichts los war, bzw. die Attraktionen schon geschlossen waren. 

Für das was wir gesehen haben, können wir keine Empfehlung aussprechen.
Dafür aber zu 100% für den v. g. \"Red Rock Canyon\". 
Eins der beliebtesten Tagesausflugsziele für Besucher von Las Vegas, 
das vom Highway 159 über den nördlichen Strip in rund 30 Minuten Fahrzeit erreichbar ist."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here for old west vegas. Fun for kids."}
{"text":"I went to the haunted houses at Bonnie Springs called Bonnie Screams. I had a great time in the converted ghost town. There were 3 haunted houses and a final Trail of Doom on the way back to my car. The haunted houses were good as were the flame show people and the magician. I think the best part was the monstrous figure that was Jason Voorhees from the Friday 13th movies...this guy was HUGE and played the part perfectly. I will definitely go back next year."}
{"text":"OK, so it's a little hokey. The food in the restaurant was good. We know nothing about the hotel and didn't do the petting zoo (we are all a little old for that). We were there mid-week and enjoyed the peace and quiet of not having lots of visitors. Had a wonderful visit with one of the shop owners and learned a lot. Enjoyed just walking around and looking into the old buildings.
The drive there (we go up Blue Diamond and leave thru Red Rock) also makes this a worthwhile trip. Oh, and the burros. In the parking lot, as we were leaving, one of the burros from the wild herd came right to the window (obviously tame enough to know how to get food). Fun and worth it and a nice change from the glitter and glare of The Strip or Fremont Street."}
{"text":"OK, it's a fun place to go if you have kids. The food was good and the animals are just as good as any small zoo. The gun show and the public hanging was a little dull but for $20.00 it's a all day thing. Of been to Vegas 500 times and I gave never seen this part of the Nevada desert. If you have the time, check it out and drive though red rock it too was really cool,"}
{"text":"We loved it,  can't wait to go back when the big round fire is lit and have hot chocolate,  the place is all cozy and country and the Mountains behind it are so beautiful"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place has seen better days. An adult, with no kids, I was looking to get away from Vegas on a day excursion. I was expecting a kitsch and and Old West vibe, but I don't think I was expecting it to be as run down as it was.  The petting zoo had a wide variety of animals, but with the small cages and close quarters I couldn't help but feel sad after walking though. I would've been quite satisfied with a large corral of goats and burros. On a busy day you'll feel as if you don't have enough room to breathe between the emus, porcupines, hogs, and children running at your feet.

The shows were fun but went on a bit too long and quickly lost it's audience. The Saloon, as a space, was impressive but need more upkeep and perhaps a better drink selection. Everyone that worked there was exceptionally nice and even apologetic about the state of disrepair. I hope a donation comes their way so they can fix the historical buildings, build a better zoo for the animals, and keep their artifacts in better condition. 

If you don't have kids and don't need a show or petting zoo I would recommend exploring one of the less touristy ghost town around here."}
{"text":"Awesome place to spend with the family. Kids love walking around and feeding the animals. It's very inexpensive. There are many free roaming animals to pet. The scenery is amazing. You get a great view of red rock."}
{"text":"I used to come here as a kid, and they have completely let this place fall apart. It's a little pricey to see a few desert animals. All the animals in the zoo look completely miserable and the other half are extremely over weight and have patches of hair missing all over them. I will never go back!! If you're okay to see miserable mistreated animals... This is the place."}
{"text":"My little group of hardcore hikers was ravenous by the time we got back to our cars.  \"How 'bout some drinks and snacks at Bonnie Springs?\" suggested one girl.  The cafe boasted a firepit at the very front and we all snagged some prime seating around it; the firepit is lit starting at sundown, so our timing was impeccable.  Super cozy and relaxing!  As for food, my pulled pork sandwich was devoured in seconds.  It hit the spot!  While it wasn't the best sandwich I've ever eaten -- the sauce was rather one-dimensional in flavour and overpowered everything in the sandwich -- it did the trick.  Our server was super nice and accommodating and we enjoyed the cafe's wild west charm.  Prices weren't as expensive as I expected; my sandwich (and fries) came to $9.99.  Pretty reasonable for a touristy place."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing experience! I did the early morning ride which included a cowboy breakfast consisting of eggs potatoes and bacon, and then we headed out on the trail.
 If you are accustomed to horseback riding this would be considered an easy trail. One for newbies :-)
 Because it is May, the temperature was absolutely perfect. I would recommend bringing a windbreaker because the winds can get very nippy across the valley that early in the morning.
The staff was extremely professional. The horses were very well trained. They had a wide assortment of horses that they assigned to riders based on height weight etc. if you weigh over 250 pounds; I'm sorry they will not accept writers with that amount of weight, it is to harmful for the horses.
 There is an option to wear a helmet, but why ruin your hairstyle when it is not a difficult trail at all.
 The views were breathtaking and it is worth making sure that you bring your phone or camera to take copious amounts of photos to remind you of how wonderful nature actually is.
 I will definitely be returning to this establishment and maybe do one of the longer evening rides."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant and I was surprised that it was opened late. Few friends and I walked around and got hungry. I highly recommend the burgers. OMG. It was delish! We also had the chocolate cake afterwards and that was yummy too! :)"}
{"text":"In all fairness, I haven't been here since I was an angelic child that demonstrated the obvious traits of a genius/future world leader. 

But, my memories are good. See, I was born and raised in good old LV NV, and we used to come out to Old Nevada every here and there for a little charm. I remember the choo choo and the goose that bit my A-hole brother right in his junk (I don't recall what he did to the goose, but I am fully confident that he deserved it.) I remember the drive out there, we would stop by the side of the road and feed fruit to donkeys that dwelled by the highway. You haven't lived until you've had a donkey trying to get into your Dad's car just to get another apple. Nor can you really call it a family outing unless your Mom comments on the size of the donkey's donkey parts. 

I'm sure that if I went back now, I'd be disappointed. It probably smells bad and is hotter than sin. I don't like sweat or dirt,  but now that both of my parents have passed away, the memories are precious and the thought of this place is endearing."}
{"text":"How the hell are u gonna have 2 windows open and have 4 lines? There's thousands of people here. And the people who pre purchased tickets have a even longer line. We were in line for almost an hour and a half and moved 10 feet. Not organized at all! This year they were not prepared for the amount of visitors. We have been going to Bonnie screams every year since they started it and we will never return again. They need to be more organized and be staffed enough to handle this large of a volume of visitors."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place when my high school Zoology class took us here on a field trip. It's a quaint little place, just right if you want an afternoon to relax, see animals, and watch some corny comedies. I did work here for a summer, and I'd have to say it probably is the best job I had - never mind how hot it was in the desert at the time. I still come and visit every now and then just to see what's new. The entrance fee is $10 a person, although this gets you into both the town and the petting zoo. They do hold corporate parties at night, where you can rent out the entire town, and the shops stay open as long as you're there. Bonnie Screams is also definitely worth a visit! It does look like an old haunted town, but it's nothing - don't let the creeps get to you until you've stayed there 'til midnight. Oh the things I heard when I worked there...."}
{"text":"This place is great, will be here again for Halloween. They employees are all super friendly and everything is reasonably priced. Great place for a date or out with the family.
The petting zoo is super fun and the deers are very friendly, tried to eat my skirt though since I had some of their feed in my hands. Ha-ha."}
{"text":"Took my family to Vegas for spring break and thought a horseback ride would be a nice diversion. Was not disappointed. Fun place, beautiful riding trail and horses are very well taken care of. Class A operation. The trail hands were funny and engaging. Highly recommend this for a nice family break from the Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"Citadel of animal depression. This was literally the most repressive place environment I have ever seen for animals. It makes any zoo look like an animal paradise twenty times over. I hope this place gets shut down."}
{"text":"There are multiple listings for Bonnie Springs, so here is a copy of what I wrote in another place:

\"My friend first introduced us to Bonnie Springs one day on a drive out to Red Rock Canyon.  Since then, we have returned a few times with other guests on the way to one of our favorite hiking spots.  

My friend first told us he was taking us to the \"demented animal farm\".  He said that this place takes in all types of animals, including ones that have been injured or abandoned in the desert over the years.  We are talking everyting from deer, hogs and wolves to exotic animals like the Australian Lynx.  They even have a peacock.

When we arrived, we found that Bonnie Springs was a lot more than a shelter for discarded animals.  There was an old western town, a train, a small motel, a pond with ducks, and a restaurant.  All of that on top of a large (and growing) section of animals.  What makes this especially funny/interesting is that this place is literally in the middle of nowhere!

The animals are my favorite.  Not only is this a free attraction, but you get to pet and feed many of the animals.  Many are in cages or are fenced in, but some are just wandering freely.  One deer, in particular, ate food from my hand as he stood next to me in the corridor.  I would say that this place is safe for children, but know in advance that this is not like a zoo.  Closed-toe shoes are recommended as the ground is rocky and uneven.  I did not see any \"demented animals\" but there are a few that have obviously had some trauma.  I always donate a few dollars.  Everytime I return, the place is larger and there are more animals.

The old western town is interesting.  Apparently, they have shows on certain days, but it was like a ghost town the last time I went.  We had one funny thing happen here.  We went into the candy store to look around.  My nephew wanted a chocolate bar.  As he was getting one from the shelf, I saw a small mouse run across the floor.  I didn't say anything.  When we got outside and he opened his milk chocolate bar, we were all horrified to find it was completely white!  Have you even seen brown chocolate turn white?  I told my nephew to keep it as it may be an artifact.

Overall, this place is a trip.  Truly worth a quick visit if you are passing through, but I wouldn't plan a day around it.\""}

{"text":"I've been to Bonnie Springs many times and have spent many $$ horseback riding, food etc.  I was absolutely horrified today when I took a group of friends there who had never been and after having breakfast there for 5 people, two is us wandered to the bar and my friend tried on a cool hat and when I tried to take a pic of him, some idiot working at the bar flew over to us and said that we weren't allowed to take photo ops with the hats for sale.  I was mortified.  Exactly how you should treat good paying customers.  I don't know who owns the place but this guy had a chip on his shoulder and if an employee of mine did that he would be gone period. Very sad."}
{"text":"A beautiful rendition of the Ole' West!  We went early, so there was a handful of people in the town.  We felt like it was our very own town.  The staff is incredible.  Round of applause for them.  We LOVED the entertainers...The Hanging Show is a MUST see!  I had high expectations prior to visiting Bonnie Springs...and they met every single one of them!  If you have visited Old Tucson or Rawhide in Arizona, the feel is very familiar yet Bonnie Springs has its individual charm and personality.  We enjoyed the restaurant as well...food was delicious!  The petting zoo is delightful!  Looking forward to booking at stay at the hotel onsite.  We also toured with the event manager for an upcoming holiday party!  Just a great experience and once again, the staff and their customer service is superior!  I tip my hat to all the employees!"}
{"text":"Whole lotta hate up in here, but I'm gonna try and counter the bitching with common sense. I think most folks have their expectations for this place up too high and they get butt hurt when it doesn't live up to it.  First complaint animal poop, hate to break it to ya folks but animals poop and they smell that's just nature. Don't believe me? ask a vet or farmer or anyone that has raised a large group of animals. It's still cool to see the ducks in the pond, The peacocks and hens running around as well as the turtles the long horn and Others on the property. Second complaint parking, yea it's tricky and most of these dopes can't drive well so be cautious and patient your'e bound to find a spot. Third complaint , \"it's a tourists trap it's not authentic\" Well no shit, if it was a real ghost town there would be no charge and there would probably be nothing there except skeleton structures and vandalism. Nevada, California and Arizona all have a slew of ghost towns, use the magic of the internet to look em up. However they are kind of a let down for a family outing. That's why you have places like this and Calico Ghost town in CA, and the wild west town in Knott's Berry Farm. It's meant to be more of entertainment than a history lesson. The primary reason people go to corny things like this , is for the kids it shut's them up it's affordable and if your'e kind of a cornball too you get a little bit of joy out of it as well. I wish there was a little more to do in the park, they have a lot of abandoned buildings that can be put to good use. The petting zoo is on the small scale but still has some cool animals. The restaurant ain't half bad a lil pricey but pretty good food like the lodge up in Charleston. The little one's really enjoy the train ride. This is a good spot to stop by when your'e in the area. Whether you are taking a hike at red rock or taking the family to Spring Mountain Ranch State Park. All in all this is a fun little roadside attraction it's not a theme park."}
{"text":"Went horseback riding. It was so much fun. =) The bathroom smells pretty bad there.  The workers there were all very nice. All the horses seems to be a little fat but I guess it's winter so they can pack some weight hehee.

Our horse tour people was very friendly. But they said they would help us take pictures but they didn't. At the end they were rushing people to get off of the horses. I guess it was going to rain that's why but still. I wanted more pictures. it's not everyday I can take a picture with a horse now."}
{"text":"This place is run down.  It's very junky and dumpy looking.  The owners need to put some cash into this place.  We almost made a reservation for the hotel and I'm so glad we didn't.  

The thing that struck me immediately were the signs everywhere prohibiting everything.  I think I saw 2 welcoming signs...one at the entrance and one at the exit.  Every other sign on the property, and there are lots of them, gives warnings and prohibitions.  Examples:  \"NO DOGS\", \"NO OUTSIDE FOOD\", \"NO PICNICS\", \"NO ONE BEYOND THIS POINT\", \"STAY OFF THE TRAIN ENGINE\", \"ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK\".  It made us feel like we were going to get in trouble for breaking the rules.  I understand you need rules.  But these signs are EVERYWHERE.  It's very annoying.  

The restaurant had excellent salmon.  It was very good.  The restaurant is rather pricey.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Depressing! So, one day, my sister-in-law's like, \"Hey! Let's bring the kids to Bonnie Springs and check out the petting zoo!\". I figured it sounded fun. We check (what we thought was the website for pricing) and off we go. We show up & they tell us that they recently changed their prices (almost double I believe) and other websites haven't updated the prices yet. Kids 18 months and under are free & thank goodness the guy at the front let my daughter in for free since I knew she was going to hate everything about this place as soon as we arrived. 

So, we go in & my son's terrified because he thinks it looks like a ghost town (exactly what it is) and is frightened it could be haunted. I pull over an employee to do a little act to reassure my son it's not haunted, give him a wink and a nudge and he tells me \"Oh, it's totally haunted\". I'm like, not for real, right *wink nudge*, \"super haunted\". I tell him for the sake of the 3 children standing next to me, it's not haunted right? \"Oh, no. Never\". Subtlety doesn't work well here. 

We check out all the random buildings, and the wax museum that holds Abraham Lincoln and Bringham Young (randoms), and then make our way to the \"petting zoo\". This is the most depressing place ever. There's a goat walking around covered in wood chips with one missing horn and a missing ear. They let a pig roam free which is scary as heck since I've seen too many horror movies where they throw bodies to the pigs to be consumed. There's a bull that stands alone in a corner that has 100 flies all over its head. A lot of the animals are asleep because they hate their lives, and it smells like crap. I feel bad for these animals since they shouldn't be in Las Vegas in 120 degree weather! If you've lived in Las Vegas your whole life, are incredibly bored, and have nothing else to do, come visit Bonnie Springs. It'll kill at least 1 hour."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the petting zoo. 
I came here today with my mom after checking out the canyon and were hoping to pet some critters, but were surprised to see that there were far more caged exotic animals than domestic ones. The only animals that you can pet here are some rather aggressive deer, goats and a burro. What really bothered my mom and me was the state that the majority of the animals were in; dirty, cramped enclosures, many of them pacing anxiously. Others had signs of biting or picking at themselves from stress. Almost all of the animals appeared unhealthy and malnourished. I understand this is just a small facility and they don't have the same funding as a large zoo, but it was still very saddening seeing the animals living this way.

Also, $10 for admission is pretty steep for any zoo, but for one as miserable as this one, I would not pay a cent. Please do not give your money to this awful place."}
{"text":"I'm always on the look out for things to do with my toddler and I was happy my friend brought me here.  We went on a Monday, and the downside was the whole town was closed except for the petting zoo.   The train runs only on weekends too.  Aside from the animals in cages and running around free in the zoo, there were many things for kids to explore and play with.  

Having just moved to Vegas, I hear that many locals complain it's not quite as stellar as it used to be.  We saw 91yo Bonnie herself on a wheelchair (they said she just had hip surgery) and she was feeding her chickens.  The staff has said they don't breed or acquire any new animals, so I guess the place ages with her.  Before it becomes completely run down, bring the kids and take lots of photos.  It is quite scenic."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 30 yrs or so and loved it as a kid and still do! And now my children enjoy it as much as we did when we were kids and I'm glad they are still open! Only thing that was disappointing was the photo taking room! When I was a kid they had a better set up and better props and I think more people would have there photos taken is they had a professional photographer taking pictures! It was a good thing I had my own camera! Don't listen to the other guys review about the place going down hill because it's a western town because it's old dummy! Sorry it's not how u remember it 20 yrs ago but it's time to grow up bub"}
{"text":"I am only giving one star bc I have to. Absolutely worst experience with management and staff. 

We have been there before and it's been ok so when we were in the area hiking we decided to stop by and see if they had a kids area for Halloween. The person behind the counter ensured us that there would be lots of fun things for my small children (4 and 7) to do. We came back. It didn't look kid friendly and there were signs for no refunds so this nice guy offered to let me cut so I could ask the teller if there would in fact be activities for the kids. She assured me, again, that there would be plenty for them to do. I waited on the long line. I paid $20 for my son and $25 for my daughter thinking it would be a whole village of activities. For the whole family it was $95. The haunted houses were inappropriate for the kids but we thought there would be more. Nope. Just a magic show. We paid $95 to watch a magic show. 

That was crappy but let's talk about how they handled the complaint the next day: first girl simply hung up when I asked to speak to a manager. Nice. The next girl answered my call wanted to know which manager to send me to (they really do not want to get you to a manager) Ok gave her my contact info for a call back. 1 week later I called again. Got the run around. Kept calling for three days before I got a manager to call me back. Kerry listened to what I said and said she would talk to the manager on staff. Ok. After another week she calls me back to tell me that the girl must have told me when she was selling the tickets. Not bc the manager remembered or saw but just bc he said that's what she would've done. That's what she needed a week to do. Talk to a manager and him to assume she said it so it must be true. Did he remember me I asked? No he delay with thousands of people that night according to Kerry. Why would I want to take my kids somewhere for $95 so they could sit at a little magic show??? Our family is busy so we only had two weekends to really do pumpkin patches or springs preserve (I wish I would have went there instead I blew my cash with this place) so we also lost out on fun w my kids for the weekend. She told me that I could have sat at the magic shows that ran every hour and a half and seen a few magic shows with the kids! Sounds awesome. Wait an hour and a half kids there is more!! Basically called me a liar even though I knew who spoke with me every time and it doesn't make logical sense for me to bring my children there. Hung up on me when I was talking to her bc she was done with me she said her point and that was that. I will never ever step foot there. After I looked on yelp and some of my mommy groups I see this problem with customer service and lying to customers to get their money is a trend for this place. I guess I should have checked here first. Don't go there. Go hiking for free or horse back ride at Mghees family ranch where they actually do care about the children and customers. Go to springs preserve. Just don't give these unprofessional swindlers your $$$."}
{"text":"Great out of the way place , very cozy atmosphere. We had pulled pork sandwiches that were up to par. The beer selection was extensive and ice cold.  Interesting decor . Good for kids , great place for motorbike or convertible cruise stop.   Doesn't feel like your typical tourist trap , not crowded and quite relaxing. The view all around you is breathtaking. We will go back."}
{"text":"We went on a horseback riding adventure on a Saturday morning.  We arrived at the bar, in the restaurant to sign up for a 60 minute horseback ride, 30 minutes prior to the next trail ride (no reservations needed!!), which is posted on their website.  We signed a few waivers, and headed over to the red barn near the petting zoo.  We were greeted immediately by friendly ranch hands.  We gave them a copy of our receipt showing we paid for the ride ($60/person for one hour).  We were then introduced to our trail guide, Steve.  We met our horses & learned how to steer the steeds.  Then we were off!  We went on an amazing ride around the basin of Red Rock/Bonnie Springs Ranch and took in some amazing views and great conversation with our guide.  Steve was great, he was very informative on the nature and the horses.  He is great at what he does and shows a passion for these animals.  We stopped along the trail, Steve tied up his horse and took a few pictures of us on our horses!  When we got back, we tipped Steve for the great service.  Keep in mind, we never rode horses before - the horses knew the trail well!  We will definitely be back for more riding!  They don't upcharge like other horseback riding companies out here.  I highly recommend Steve, and my horse, Whiskey!  My husband and I were lucky to not have anyone else sign up for that particular hour timeslot, so we had a nice ride to ourselves (and Steve of course)."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bonnie Springs. We watched \"The Hanging\", wandered through the Wax Museum, participated in the \"Deputy Training\", walked through the zoo, rode the train, and last but not least... dressed up in old school clothes and took our family photo! We loved the staff and the experience!!  WE CAN'T WAIT TO DO THIS AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"This place was so adorable! We took my little sister here for her 10th birthday and she had a blast. I had a lot of fun myself with the animals. Please, please give places like this a try instead of taking your kids to Chuck E Cheese.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Couple miles away from Blue Diamond and Red Rock Canyon.
perfect for family and friend outdoor activity.
First time when i went there i remember i paid couple bucks to park and about $10 per person to enter the little western town.
Small but very fun if you come with kiddos.
they do some dual and hanging and have you participate!
the only thing that would be nice to work on is the food and beverage area inside the town, bring some real cook and staff and I am quite sure people we surely dine there!
you will find a  little souvenir store
petting zoo is available as well. The smell is strong but well, you are surrounded by the wild animals! 
on your left of the little town, you have a pond with some ducks and turtles. Few beautiful and well fed peacocks are walking around.
you will also find a dining restaurant 
to take you back to the main parking g lot you can use the little tramway.
today we were waiting for the train when we were told the train derailed 
we just walked!!
take your family and have a fun day"}
{"text":"We visited this historical place on a perfectly sunny Saturday. Don't want to give all the details away but the entire staff are friendly, smiling and funny! I drove here to surprise my Son who thought we were just going to drive through Red Rock. I was happy seeing his smile and amazement when we arrived there."}
{"text":"Ahh, Bonnie Springs Ranch.  The ghost town of my teenage fun.  Writing this as a parent now I have to say that things sure have changed.  I know I made a wide eyed nostolgic write up about them a year ago.  This time I will be less biased.  Coming to Bonnie Springs is 20 minute trip up Red Rock Canyon past everything but the small town of Blue Diamond.  The scenic views are majestic.  

Once you reach the old outpost it's a slight hilly drive down a 2 lane road to get to the little train station parking.  Drive the posted 25 mph speed limit, as the BLM is on the prowl at times.  A bit further is a closer yet somewhat desert landscape parking.  When you enter the transplanted ghost town of \"Old Nevada\" there is a ticket booth.  It's $10 for adults and $7 for kids 3+ to enter the town, train, wax museum, petting zoo and watch the shows.  Surely you may wait to ride the little train first as it stops in the front of the ghost town.

When you enter the ghost town it's just like an old miner town that is appropriately dilapidating with age.  There are no real renovations done, other than transporting all these old buildings to miss Bonnies ranch.  It's not a polished and rebuilt town like the Calico Ghost Town of California.  Bonnies has all the dry rot and untarnished patina that you would see if you were to stumble across a long abandoned boom town.  The chapel seems to be the newest and most updated of all the buildings.  The spookiest building for me would be the old rock crusher.  There are old chuck wagons and western machinery abound.  Definitely a steampunk fans dream back drop.  Although it is a bit tattered, I would not say that anything is at all dangerous.

The shows here used to be something of a gem about 4-10 years ago.  They used to be really entertaining and there would have been more townsfolk around.  Now a days it seems only a handful of shop keeps are sticking around, the only real western presence you interact with now are simply 2 townsfolk.  A single bandit and one lone sheriff.  They are the show.  3 different scheduled shows are performed still.  It seems as the cast has changed hands a few times over the years these shows become less and less enthusiastic.  Expect blanks fired and cowpoke'n around.  There are no cows in the shows.

The hotel/motel is about as good an accommodation as you can find for about 20 miles from the ranch.  The theme rooms have hot tubs in them.  It is the wild west so a straggling beetle may be present at times.  The restaurant is still just as good.  Offering buffalo burgers etc. and I highly suggest the corn fritters, ask for ranch.  Pony rides and horseback riding is still prevalent.  Bar still serves the strong Long Islands!

The kids enjoy the ranch every time yet it's not as performed as it used to be.  I love this Ranch.  My horse used to love this ranch.  Still a great little break from the V.I.P. strip and city life."}
{"text":"Had a great visit here! Beautiful scenery, great for kids, fun old time place! Bonnie did good job creating"}
{"text":"We are so lucky to have this really cool place minutes from the city!
My niece was visiting and I brought her here for something different.

She loved it! Especially the pony ride. Luckily we checked the website, as she needed to be wearing closed toe shoes, normally she would have been in sandals. Kids also have to be under 5 and less than 50lbs. That was not an issue!

We went to the petting zoo area. She seemed to like the ones in the cages a bit better. 
The deer are pretty excited in hopes that you will feed them, it was a bit much for a 3 yro.

They also do random shows through out. the day. We went to one in the saloon, after explaining we were going to see a show. It was pretty bad, in a fun campy way. About 1/2 way through the show, my niece as loud as can be asks \"I thought they were doing a show??\" - We all laughed at the irony! And she kinda nailed it!

This is a fun non-strip adventure! Great for kids! Do a little googling and you can find some coupons to make admission a few dollars cheaper. 

Now I am looking forward to their Halloween Haunted event \"Bonnie Screams\"
I have heard it is a blast!"}
{"text":"We loved the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes and gravy with corn and biscuit.  It can get very busy! P.S.  Flirting with the wait staff gets you better service."}
{"text":"Loved it! It was a fun, western experience! I love the train ride, zoo and the costume change/pics."}
{"text":"Had a great halloween at bonnie springs! If u ever get a chance to go to vegas during halloween, that is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the road to Bonnie Springs is absolutely amazing.  Bonnie Springs itself is like a secret gem within Las Vegas.  

Located far off Charleston on the west side of the mountains.  Is old town Vegas that seems very interesting for tourist and kids alike.  The drive there is amazing.  Then again I'm that kind of person who like the scenic view of the mountains and the valley surrounding it.  It's not far from Red Rock either. So, able to drive threw Red Rock was also a treat.  But arriving at Bonnie Springs, it was kind of interesting, since its a narrow road and have to drive close to the bushes whenever oncoming vehicles are leaving.  We were also stopped by a few burros that were just roaming the road.  One of them actually came to sniff the hood of our car.  It was interesting and funny at the same time.  Kind of slowed us down to our final destination but it was kind of cool.  

Getting there, parking wasn't the usual parking lot you might expect but a pit in the area and find your own parking spot is more like it.  Which was okay, it wasn't as busy, but there were a few cars here and there.  

They had a small train track for people to ride a train around the area, but I guess it wasn't working.  But we were able to get our wrist band for the petting zoo.  I thought the animals would be fenced, but when we got into the area, animals are just wondering around in one big cage.  There are a few animals that are behind fences but those that are wondering are harmful.  We got to pet goats, deers, donkey and see animals behind fences or cages within the big fence.  Those animals wondering around you can also feed.  They have this gumball looking machine that has animal feed in it.  Put in a quarter and out comes the feed.  It was a nice experience, especially if you like petting zoos.

We even walked around the old Vegas town, where it shows how the old town looked like, where people got married and still can get married there today.  Even the old steal mill that they had.  They had a wax museum but its more of a guided museum where there is a set time slots that you have to be at the door by,  in order to be guided threw the museum.  

We also went to their restaurant which seems really decent.  But I have that in a different review.  I do find it very cleanly and unique and customer service is good.  

Overall, if you want to look on how old Vegas use to be back before there were casinos.  This might be a good place to check out. The petting zoo, taking a look at old Vegas and other activities, all in one place is probably worth the trip.  Especially looking at the scenery of the mountains and Red Rock is a plus.  Very well recommended"}

We came to the ranch around noon . The ticket was 10$ per person( it included zoo, shows and museum ) . Since I love animals , the zoo was the most exciting  part for me . I can't even describe how happy I was to see all those fat goats , donkeys and ponies walking around . ( it is kind of a contact zoo ) I had a chance to pet all those cuties and to feel like a kid . It was a wonderful experience and I would love to come back !"}
{"text":"Recent horseback ride with my kiddo.  Tour guide was very kind and stopped in the middle of the ride to take photographs of the riders. Easy to ride horses are great for beginners and the trail is a nice place to relax outside Vegas."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews on this place. Some say it's sad, some say it's quirky. I agree with the latter. I think the place is great for people watching and animal petting. Not so much the other way around.

The place is a little rundown and some of the animals looked like they were quite old. But hey, we all get old and I'm guessing the place could use more income to really spruce it up.

The animals are kept mostly in pens in one particular area of the ranch. I think I saw the owner of the place with her walker and a box full of feed. I didn't get to meet her but I snapped a couple of pix which I've posted here on Yelp. The pens are all pretty close together so you find yourself walking through a narrow maze with a few animals wandering freely which your kids can pet.

You can buy a hamster or guinea pig if you want. I though that was kinda cool.

The place is sprawling and I had to wonder what the upkeep required as far as manpower and financing. There's an old town where they used to have several tourist shops and food places. It looks like they've shut down a number of years ago.

There are still melodramas on the weekends and some kids really get into the booing and hissing of the villians.

The little train that runs from the motel/ resort to the restaurant and old town winds through basic brush and trees of the desert. It's nothing fancy but again... to a kid, it's pretty neat.

The bar and restaurant that are open today has a sort of biker bar feel about it. Great people watching and the prices are reasonable. I dig it.

Overall, it's not a place I'd recommend to everyone. The place is old and funky and it's probably not going to interest someone who enjoys
the glitz of the Strip casinos or a modern, clean place for your kids to put their mouths on everything. (Yuck! Why'd I even think of that?!)

But... for a little roadside attraction and some great people watching,.... why not?"}
{"text":"The staff at the hotel are super friendly and helpful - and the rooms are reasonably priced and clean.  And DECORATED!  Each room has a different theme and it's very much like walking into a 60s spaghetti western - I had the \"Calico Room\" with pink trimmings and indoor-outdoor carpet that had a design like wood plank flooring.  There are other, fancier decorated rooms and you can see the pictures on the website.  I asked housekeeping if she could show me a few of her favorites and it was quite a treat.  Super kitschy and fun - clean and comfortable.  

There are animals EVERYWHERE - peacocks, a corral full of horses, a waterfowl pond and a little zoo of rescued animals.  Super close to Red Rocks and not as cheap as some of the casino hotels but rustic and homey and more of an experience that I enjoyed over walking through cigarette smoke filled casinos.

NB: The restaurant has one vegan friendly option: french fries.  OK, plus beer so that's two.  Plan to bring your own food if you are vegan."}
{"text":"I was babysitting one day and decided it would be fun to take the kids here. We parked the car at the bottom lot because there were some donkeys hanging in it and you could take a small train tot he top. The kids had a blast in the petting zoo, and chasing peacocks around. They loved the fake gun show in the little ghost town, We grabbed some food at the restaurant which was pretty fairly priced and I had them take some of those old fashioned pictures where they played cards and pretended to drink booze. It was a great time and before I knew it the day was over."}
{"text":"Note: Based on the other reviews, it seems like there is a lot more to this place than I will experience, so my review is only based on motel room experience.

W and I are in the area for CES and, of course, we waited last minute to purchase hotel tickets. This is the only place we could find under $200 via Expedia, and since we drove in ourselves, we didn't mind that this was 40 minutes outside the convention center. The drive here was really beautiful, as the mountains/red rock canyon is just IN YOUR FACE and so beautiful.

Our booking ended up being one of the themed rooms with a hot tub, which was pretty exciting. The room itself is pretty corny, but then again they are all specifically themed (ours is big wagon or something) and I guess it makes for a nice romantic getaway if you're into that sort of thing? What kind of freaks me out is the amount of mirrors in the room; there is even a mirror on the ceiling over the bed and, not gonna lie, it kind of grossed me out and took me a minute before I could lay down on the bed.

There's not much around here to do at night, and the restaurant is just a whole different story (I've left a separate one star review for them). I was originally going to put 2 stars, but I am thankful that I was able to get a room during a busy convention time last minute."}
{"text":"This place was a ghost town!  Maybe it was cool at one point in time, but it seemed very run down.  There were a lot of animals in cages that seemed unhappy.  I've never really liked zoos, so once I saw the wolves pacing I was done.

Didn't try the restaurant, so I can't say much there.  But needless to say, I won't be back due to the animals :("}
{"text":"This place is a blast. My kids had a wonderful time and there is SO much to do! We spent about three hours here just exploring. We will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute !! There is a petting zoo, live western shows, little western town to explore, train ride, and a restaurant. My kids cried when it was time to leave. I don't even understand how people could complain about this place, for 7 bucks a kid and 10 per adult it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"I went here in the mid 90's so don't know what it's like now, but from what I remember, it was a fun little pseudo ghost town and worth the 45 trip out from Vegas to see it."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and get away.  Also a zoo with animals and a good place for the whole family.  Breakfast served u till noon and drinks along with real hearty meals.  Cute and quant and a train for the kids with animals way better than the actual zoo!  Definitely a place to bring friends and family :)"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience and my seven year old granddaughter wanted to go again as soon as we completed the trail..fun family time..what a great place and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable..the food was good also..yes I'll be back"}
{"text":"Fun place on a Spring Day. They have a beautiful back drop, a train, petting zoo, cool old building to walk through, a shoot out in the middle of the street with cowboys and a fun place to take old time pictures. Stop in and get some boot lunch at the restaurant. Cool old time atmosphere, eat lunch inside with a view of the pond with ducks and turtles. The burgers are tasty and the homemade ranch is great with the fries."}
{"text":"Tourist trap or a legit historic site? There's historic significance here, but I guess I was expecting to see original buildings and plenty of information, rather than replicas and shootout western shows. 

Note: Before parking, you'll be asked to pay $10 per person if you want to see the entire ranch. After paying, you're given a wristband and access to park in their lot. If you plan on coming here, bring CA$H. 

Train Ride: Now, hands down the little railroad train is the best part of Bonnie Springs Ranch. It's a round trip ride from the \"town\" to another parking lot not too far away. Although it's a short ride, you don't have to walk on the dirt trails that are scattered with animal dung, plus the views of Red Rock Canyon are gorgeous. 

Petting Zoo: It's a sad sight to see. The animals, especially the wolves that are baking under the sun. Flies hover around animals and their filthy water dishes. I wish they were better cared for. 

\"Old Town:\" The town is comprised of aging buildings that house gift shops selling tacky souvenirs. Several rooms showcase dusty antiques that's enough to make you cough and walk right out. In addition, a lot of these items don't have descriptions --- learning will have to wait another day.  There's also this mine-maze thing that reminds me of Halloween mazes, except without the freaky looking characters jumping at you around every corner. Walking through it made me nauseous because it's uneven and rickety. 

Performers: They're obnoxious and not funny at all with their corny jokes and their attempts to grab your attention by firing off fake guns at you. LAME. The act is something I'd expect from a 7 year-old kid and not a grown dude who's trying to get into \"character.\" Also, some of these actors harass the animals onsite by attempting to pet them when they're guarding their young. 

Restaurant: We never had the chance to eat here because no one came by to seat us.

Bonnie Springs Ranch is a waste of a few hours that you'll never get back. Keep your $10 and spend it somewhere else."}
{"text":"I happened to go on a day they were \"closed\" and dark, meaning no Wild West shows.  I still got to roam the town, enjoyed the sights and visited their gift store and restaurant all in a beautiful location on a picture perfect day.

I got all the way back to California before realizing I did not have my purse.  I just figured it was gone and not to fret.

I received a Facebook message from Alan Levinson stating they found my purse.  They are mailing it back to me and I am most appreciative of customer service above and beyond.  

I will be making a return visit again n the future."}

{"text":"My granddaughter rode the pony for $7.50 it was a dime when I was three years old. Otherwise the petting zoo was ok. It was packed on Easter afternoon. Not much to do."}
{"text":"It concerned me very much to see the horses' water was slimy.  Looks like they don't clean the containers too much.  Also, after doing some research I found out that Peta2 has them featured on The 17 Deadliest Destinations for Animals.  May be nice to see the animals, but at who's expense?"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! My kids had so much fun. We went for early dinner and got to see the ducks and the small zoo animals. Took great photos with the old train and everything else. My kids enjoyed it so much. They had live country music playing. Awesome beer and food (onion rings are a must try) yummy!!  The bar area had the ceiling full of dollar bills that people hang. Overall an awesome experience! Will definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Went there today with our 5 yr old. Shows were funny and the employees had a lot of information about all the antiques on the property. Zoo was cool, animals are sorta aggressive when it comes to feeding them but its OK. The reason why I am giving them 5 stars is because of the guy (sorry I can't remember his name) who ran my daughters pony ride. He was super nice to my daughter told her all about the pony even explained his name to her when she asked him 10xs lol he made my daughters day. The only reason why I would go back again is to give her another pony ride. So all in all we had a great day but in the end thank u to the guy who did the pony ride with \"Levi\" the pony. I feel bad I don't remember your name but that is all my daughter \"Madison\" (in case u read this and remember her lol) talks about. Recommend too all especially if you have kids under 5 to ride the pony's !"}
{"text":"Came here after checking out Red Rock Canyon. Upon entering it was like you were entering into an old western town like in the old Cowboys movies lol. Off to the left is a motel were you can actually stay at. Once upon entering the ranch you see a little train going around mostly for the kiddies. And then you see a Zombie bus which every certain Sat you can go on it and shoot at zombies on their lot somewhere. They have a zoo where you can see some animals and tons of peacocks roaming around the grounds and of course it smells pretty bad like the zoo. Overall was a nice place to see when you're in the Red Rock Canyon area."}
{"text":"My sister was in town for a few days and we decided to try horseback riding at Bonnie Springs Ranch! It was definitely the best thing we did while she was here! We had a quick delicious lunch at the restaurant/bar before signing up for the hour ride. As it turned out, we were the only ones signed up for that time frame! Our guide Chris was wonderful!! She was so friendly and funny and very informative during the ride. Of course, it's absolutely beautiful scenery out there, but Chris made it all the more better. The other girls that got us signed up and ready with the horses were wonderful too! Overall, an amazing experience that I will definitely be doing again."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs is a nice place. But you have to keep your expectations in check when you head over there. If you go you're NOT going to get an amusement park experience like Bush Gardens, Knott's Berry Farm, etc. You're NOT going to experience a zoo like the one in San Diego or countless of other big cities.

What you will see is a small, family-friendly ranch with employees that will make you feel welcome. Most of the week the price of admission is $20 per car (on Mondays and Tuesdays it's $5 per person). That price includes access to the zoo/petting zoo and the mini-train ride.

The zoo may not have world-class facilities (the ranch is a non-profit organization, afterall) but the animals looked well fed. I was expecting to see only horses and maybe a couple goat or sheep. But, they had llamas, alpacas, lynx, ravens, wolves and many more. There are also plenty of roosters and peacocks roaming the grounds.

They've got horseback riding for $55 per person for a one hour tour. We didn't try it but my three year old son did go on his first pony ride and loved it. It cost $7.50 per kid (for kids 5 and under weighing less than 50 lbs.). There's no set time limit for the ride. The guy manning the pony area just stops it when he thinks it's time. Yeah, that was a little annoying because when we purchased a ticket for the ride the guy at the restaurant said it's usually 5-10 minutes long. That's kind of a big difference for a kid. But, my kid loved it even thought it seemed a little short. Plus he looked so cute and fearless wearing the helmet they provide.

The \"old town\" area looks cute. It's not as old as you might think, but looks the part. They have shows/melodramas several times throughout the day, but we didn't stick around for any of them.

The miniature train is something that little kids will like but doesn't really provide a whole lot of sightseeing. It start at the main entrance in old town, heads down to the lower parking lot, and back again. My kid was thrilled to ride it... I wish adults were as easily entertained.

All in all it was a fun experience. It was a good way to kill a few hours and entertain the little guy. It might be a good place to have a kid's bday party. I think most little rugrats would love the train, zoo and pony rides."}
{"text":"Just wish more of the place was accessible for a reasonable charge. Love the animals roaming and the fish pond. Love the old west motif, which kind of gets lost among Vegas' glitz and glamour."}
{"text":"Petting zoo was smsll..not much in wsy of variety but it was ok...the pens needed cleaning really stunk.  the western town was kind of dead on weekday.  there was a show..a hanging...lot of chatter u couldnt understand..it was two guys so-so. we had to hunt for a clerk and candy was stale..hard as a rock..not much turnover? Only one bathroom open clear in back of town not good for my sr mom. The museums were do dusty coukdnt stay in.  they had a/c on so high u had to get out ..it waa cool out why a/c?  odd.  train wasnt running.  so for $10 bit high but at least it feeds the animals.  naybe turning off ac wgen not needed would vonserve on overhead.  anyway..overall not much for adults but ok for kids.  need more pkaces for older folks to sit n enjoy scenery"}
{"text":"Seems to be the only spot in Red Rock/Blue Diamond to get a meal. We stopped here for breakfast, did not visit the zoo, western town, train ride - I don't think they were open yet.

They do a good breakfast here, not worth driving out there just for that alone(but the trip to Red Rock is worth it), but  if you are in the area and hungry, don't be afraid to stop here.  Breakfast prices are very reasonable. They do have a lunch and dinner menu.

The dining area is very rustic, feels like you are in the old west.

There were signs of a $20 entry per car, but that only applies if you wish to visit the old town."}
{"text":"Quaint !"}
{"text":"I love this place. The only thing I wish is that the wolf and emu's exhibit is bigger. One of the wolves was pacing for about 10 minutes straight, looping around the edges of their enclosure. This is a sign of distress for he needs room to roam. The emu's are also rather cramped in the corner.

However, there is no solution if people do not donate money! I would most definitely donate if I knew my money would go towards a bigger enclosure for both animals."}
{"text":"After a day at Red Rock we decided to check out Bonnie Springs. Just a few more miles down the road it is easy to find, plenty of signs for guidance. it is tough to find parking at times but they offer paring a little further away with a train ride(at a cost) to the main area. There is a restaurant there and some animals (ducks, peacoks and a steer) for the kids to look at. I believe their was a petting zoo inside and they have shows that go on in the town (there is a fee to get in here) that go off on the hour. It might be neat for kids but is was pretty plain and boring and not worth the price od admission for me anyway."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed with our family's experience at this petting zoo. All 6 staff members were hanging out taking selfies and having personal conversation while completely disregarding any and all guests walking in. We had questions about the animals roaming free but our questions were left unanswered by the staff. We all noticed the animals were a little on the aggressive side going after everyone's clothing and the staff didn't even notice or seem to care. Other zoo guests had questions as well and one of the zookeepers couldn't even give a knowledgable answer. As for the care of the animals, it didn't seem like they were in a pleasant living environment. It looked as though animal cruelty had been taking place. They had hardly any water, one animal had a nasty hole in it's side and they just looked miserable overall. Everything at Bonnie springs ranch was really cool, but the zoo is in desperate need of attention, care and improvements"}
{"text":"Basic bar and American restaurant fare . Service is below average . But that's not why you go there . You go for the old western theme and after a hike at red rock or to show family from out
Of town something different ."}
{"text":"What a fun place to spend a morning or afternoon away from the busyness of the Las Vegas strip...

The melodrama is in sketches are corny but well worth the time spent staying for all of them. 

The price of admission is very reasonable and the drive is beautiful make sure you complete the entire loop and stop along the way at red rock canyon national monument and take the 13 mile scenic drive.

If you're from out of town visiting Las Vegas and have a half a dayI would highly recommend you visit Bonnie Springs resort and ghost town."}
{"text":"I had a blast horseback riding. We went when it snowed and the rest of the people who signed up to go horse back riding canceled so it was like we had our own private tour"}
{"text":"Sorry to give such a bad review, since the staff seems sincere, but it's not worth your time to come here.  The place is really run down and there's no explanation whether the buildings are authentic or replicas.  The entrance fee is $10/adult and $7/kid.  This allows you to see the \"stage drama\" and the \"hanging and shooting\" reenactment which are pretty hokey (and each lasted less than 10 minutes), although our young children did enjoy the shootout.  The zoo is pretty sad and there is nothing to see in the rest of the buildings.  You can see everything in less than 1/2 an hour.  When we were leaving, I felt like warning the people coming in from  the parking lot not to waste their money."}
{"text":"Have you been to this place? This is certainly more than just a restaurant. It's a quaint old tyme attraction at the foothill of the beautiful red rock mountains. From ducks to horses to antique tchotchkes even cowboys walking around giving you a hard time! This place has a small petting zoo with animals that have found a permanent home at this beautiful quaint location. Certainty worth visiting!"}
{"text":"I did have a great time but there are definitely pros and cons at Bonnie Springs.

Pros:
It's an escape from Vegas - some friends from the UK came to visit and they just wanted a break from the Strip.
It's a fun outing for a group - there isn't that much to do around there, but if you combine it was the scenic route drive it's really nice.
The staff are really friendly.
They have unusual animals.

Cons:
Price - $8-$10 is a little steep considering there isn't really that much to do/see and you have to pay more for the petting zoo.
If you are a big animal person, you may find this place a little distressing. Some of the cages are very small and offer little protection from the Vegas summer heat.
Also, very little information is given about the buildings/ghost town you are walking through.

Overall I would give the staff 5 stars and they do have an adorable coatimundi, which I hadn't seen before. I just feel like maybe the entry should be a donation fee and the zoo entry should be the $10, with the money going towards larger, cooler enclosures."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun. We did wish there were more animals to pet for being a petting zoo. Just a couple deer, goats and a burro. The shows were fun though, the actors did good. I wish they would add Baby changing tables to the bathrooms. For $10 though it was definitely a fun trip and some cool stuff to see."}
{"text":"I attempted to enjoy Bonnie's Springs today on my way to Mt. Charleston. However, the manager, Olivia did not want that to happen
I was accompanied by my Service Animal and had her proper paperwork.
I entered the restaurant and asked someone if they could find a place out of the way so my animal would not disturb others.
She immediately asked me what disability was. I replied back that, it was not appropriate for her to ask and against the law. She fired back by saying \"I  have a right to ask sweetheart\" and then reworded the question to, \" what functions is your dog trained for?
As a 45 year old woman, I felt \"sweetheart\"  was very condescending. Especially from someone clearly younger then I.
I then told her I would provide her with my paperwork and in that paper would answer her question. There were patroons and others around and I was embarrassed to answer the question.
Her reply was \"we are not doing this\". So, I asked for her name and the name of the owner. I intend to file a complaint with Clark County."}
{"text":"Didn't have time to check the place out much, but did have lunch. Neat atmosphere befitting the setting, despite showing it's age. Not much selection, so three of us went for burgers. Dry meat, stale bread, tough fries. Bleh.

Cute, but it's not 1860; I can drive to the next place to eat."}
{"text":"love coming here and walking around.  The wild west area is great to explore and watch the show.  The petting zoo/zoo is also good for our little kids.  The cafe is also good - a bit pricey, but worth it if you come here once a year."}
{"text":"For 10 dollars I'm giving this place 5 stars as you get way more than you pay for! Great place to bring friend families and out of towners! Great place to ride motorcycles to ! Petting zoo, free range of ghost town, hangings, shootouts, reasonable drinks, great potato skins, turtle pond , peacocks running around all over! Get there!"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here once and today I was at a meeting in the Saloon that had a continental breakfast.  

Bonnie Springs Old Nevada is OK if you keep in mind a couple of things.  It's been around for a long time, but it's recreated history, not a real historical place.  The zoo area is somewhat run down.  The folks are trying to get it turned into a non-profit so they can upgrade the pens for the animals.

The restaurant is quite good albeit a little pricey for where it is.  You do not have to pay admission if you are going there just to eat.

The place is best for families with younger children and on weekends when the train runs.  Kids of any age will enjoy the peacocks and ducks and other animals.  Yes, it is in need of renovation."}
{"text":"You gotta get an order of the sweet corn fritters they are to die for just try don't ask any questions just try em!!!!!!!yum.....gonna miss this place....cause of them fritters!!!  Well i would order 2 orders to make life easier cause your definatly  going to want more"}
{"text":"This is a good activity for a day with the kiddies.  The Old West part is interesting for the kids.  There are nice, open areas for them to run around in and you don't feel embarrassed.  The melodramas were amusing and *mostly* kept the kids attention.  The train ride was eh.  I am bothered by the petting zoo, but the kids seemed to think it was pretty neat.  Sometimes, it is just nice to get out of town and this place does the trick (without the exercise of Red Rock or Mt. Charleston!)."}
{"text":"Good family fun spot.
Small petting zoo, which includes deer, goats, and sheep roaming free. There are also mini horses, donkeys, rabbits, porcupine, wolf, and ferrets in cages. The San Diego Zoo, it is not, but it's the closest thing we've got in town. The petting zoo area has dispensers set all around where you can buy a handful of deer food for 25 cents, which is enjoyable for young and old alike.
The old west town part is fun, if not a little run down (only adds to the authenticity, yes?). There are a couple actors who perform a melodrama and a hanging multiple times a day - it's not Broadway, but it's fun.
There's also a traditional \"cowboy-style\" restaurant and a huge bar. So on a nice sunny day, you can walk around with a bud heavy while you visit the old tyme candy shop and stuff.
$10/adult or $7 (I think) with military discount."}
{"text":"When it comes to a lot of things, having logical and appropriate expectations makes all the difference. Bonnie Springs Old Nevada is the perfect example of a place that people can easily enjoy, provided they do not set their expectations too high. In other words, know what you are getting into! This is not a place to go if you dislike dirt, the smell of animals or need to use sidewalks for a wheelchair/stroller. 

Bonnie Springs Old Nevada is a replication of a old 1800s mining town. Many would call it a ghost town. There is a hotel, a petting zoo, horse rides and a restaurant in addition to the small town with shops, a chapel and gun-fight reenactments. There is a small train that runs around part of the property, however it only operates on weekends. There is a $20 fee per carload to enter the actual town and petting zoo, however you can eat in the restaurant without paying this fee. A car load is 6 people, and you do not necessarily need to show up int he same vehicle to get this rate. 

I recently attended a birthday party for the daughter of a friend here. The food served in the restaurant was basic, the service was on point. What really made the party great was the petting zoo... The kids really loved the animals. The big kid in me loved them too! 

The grounds do appear to be a little run down, but remember, this is supposed to be a ghost town. The employees I dealt with when I was there were courteous and helpful. If you can handle a little dirt and smelliness, and especially if you have little ones, take them down to Bonnie Springs to enjoy a little rustic entertainment!"}
{"text":"It's not the same without Bullet Bob! He made the story line more realistic and w aw always fun to see and chat with, he always kept character and was the image you think of when going into a western town. I've stayed at the hotel a couple times and visited bonnie spring many many more times than that and our last trip in may was disappointing when our favorite cowboy wasn't there to make the show what we loved."}
{"text":"This place was awful and not worth your money at all! The petting zoo was so sad and the animals are just laying on dirt in small cages. I know the town is old and it's supposed to be that way but there's a couple stores with little trinkets that are silly, I never saw where the restaurant was there just doors to the restroom, and the other areas are empty so it's basically a dirt lot and  abandoned buildings. There's nothing to do or for the kids to do. I don't understand the hype..."}
{"text":"Way too much money for basically nothing. It's $10 per adult just to get into the little town that is nothing. The petting zoo is a joke. The only thing you get to pet are the few deer and a few sheep that hand around the quarter food machines."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs Ranch is a cool little place to bring a family for a couple of hours and have fun without breaking the bank.  At only $10 per adult, you can't go wrong.  There are some gift shops to browse and some museums to expand your knowledge.  There is a posse show, a hanging show, and a melodrama.  A small train to ride with a conductor who will take pictures of you and with you.  And a little zoo where you can pet and feed some of the animals.  I brought my grandparents out here for an afternoon and they loved it.  Especially the zoo.  Some of the animals, sheep and deer mostly, came right up to us looking for food.  We just pet them and sent them on to the next unsuspecting guests.  No food from us.  If I had a quarter or two on me perhaps I would have gotten a handful of feed to give out.

As much fun as Bonnie springs was for us, we could not help but notice how badly in need of repair much of this place is.  The museum displays are filthy dirty and totally covered in dust.  The \"rock\" face in the crooked mine shaft as well as in the wax museum is clearly scultpted foam.  I know this because I could see where it had been broken off revealing the true pink color of it.  The train seems like it is just rusting to death.  There were loose panels and holes in the roof that were rattling around making for a very noisy ride.  And finally, the actors who put on the shows aren't really that good.  They are corny and hard to hear as there is no sound system.  The special effects weren't even timed properly.

I know it seems like I am being a bit harsh but in reality, I am comparing Bonnie Springs to more big budget parks like Knott's Berry Farm (Ghost Town specifically) which have a similar theme.  I'm not saying one is better than the other.  Bonnie Springs has a special kind of charm that your bigger parks lose to modern technology.  In that way, it is in a league of its own and all the better for it.  But at $10 per visitor, Bonnie Springs cannot keep up with the small tasks that would make more seemless the division of our society and that of the past.  I would be willing to pay just $5 more per person if it meant they could fix up and improve on their park while keeping with the small town/park traditions it expresses currently.

One thing they cannot improve on even if they try is the views.  My grandma said repeatedly she could not believe the back drop was actual mountains.  She thought it was painted.  I assure you though, the artist who created the natural scenery in these parts is the unsurpassed master artist.  The greatest in all of history."}
{"text":"For a fun outing with family or out of town visitors (preferably younger), I recommend Bonnie Springs Ranch. While perhaps lacking in upkeep and modern niceties, it's still a cute place to go for $8-10 pp.  There's free parking in dirt lots and if you park at the very end lot, a small locomotive will take you to the Bonnie Springs entrance. Once you pay, you'll get a wristband to enter the Ranch. Walking down the dusty road that is lined on each side with stores, shooting arcade, a wedding chapel you can really get married in, a petting zoo entrance to the left, and at the end of the road is a saloon. Minimal drink options available here and there are theatrical shows every couple hours. There is a shootout show followed by a hanging. The actors tried their best to be energetic, however they seemed tired of the repetitive act. It is sort of entertaining and moderately humorous, but the kids thought it was funny. 
The petting zoo the one and only time we went, was fine. I read other Yelp reviews, the day we were there it was chilly and there were no flies. I do agree that some of the cages seemed very small. There are deer, goats and small ponies walking freely and gladly eating alfalfa pellets out of your hand. There are also roosters, chickens and beautiful peacocks walking around. In one pen there are a couple wolves, in others, kangaroos, emu, turtles, etc. Other than the deer and goats, there's not a ton of \"petting\" at the petting zoo. The one worker I saw was very carefully watching to make sure guests were treating the animals with respect. 
The restaurant is dark and a bit run down, with a funky flair in western decor, but the food was actually quite good. Our order took 45 minutes and with two small children and a tween and teen, it felt longer. Items orders; hamburgers, grilled cheese, turkey burger, sourdough sandwich, side salad, and scoops of ice cream for the kids. Average plate was $9. Service was super nice, just SO slow (we guessed it was the kitchen, not the waitresses). There's a full bar inside the restaurant, as well.
There's a pond with ducks and again peacocks walking gallantly around, occasionally flourishing their dazzling feathered tails. In one pen there is a ginormous steer named Houdini boasting the largest horns I've ever seen. 
Back inside the ranch, there's a couple gift shops to buy western or Native American themed items. There's also a shootout arcade set as an old fashioned western saloon, with rifles to shoot at bottles or targets on hats. 
Again, part of your paid fee is a train ride, unlimited. Our younger kids loved it and took the train 3 times. 
I did not see it, but there is schoolhouse in premise that was filmed in one of those ghost-paranormal tv shows and is supposedly haunted. 
If you have out of town guests, or your own smaller kids want something to do one day, I would recommend Bonnie Springs Ranch. While not lavish or perhaps updated recently, it's $8-10 pp., and you're not going to go anywhere for cheaper than that."}
{"text":"I took my baby here today because we had heard about the petting zoo from another parent.  It wasn't too expensive here- they only charged me $10 as an adult, and it wasn't hard to find (just five miles past Red Rock Canyon on the right.)  The gentleman at the counter who sold me my ticket was kind, and the gentleman today that was in the store before the petting zoo was also kind, but not a single other person who works here made any effort to direct us anywhere or make themselves known.  I wasn't even sure who worked here.  The petting zoo was not what I expected- there were flies everywhere, some of the animals looked like their fur was falling out as if they had been pecked by the roosters or had some skin disease, and there was poop everywhere as if no one ever cleans it up, and to top it all off some of the animals didn't belong in such small confining cages!  Had I known they had two kangaroos and a wolf or coyote in such a small cage I would not have come here at all.  I think that ducks, roosters and some small farm animals like the bunnies had enough space, but I am not trying to encourage places to cage animals in such small spaces!  It was very depressing and sad to see and I don't want my daughter thinking it is OK to cage animals in this way.  I'm sure people who work here care about the animals and are doing what they can, but from the looks of it they are understaffed.  I don't understand why some of these animals have small cages when space is not a commodity in this region.  They can't build bigger pens for them?  While at Bonnie Spings I also saw part of the Hangman show.  It was entertaining to the little kids that were watching and they did try to do a cute job with special effects.  Before coming here I read other people's reviews and they were saying the place seemed run-down.  I didn't think it seemed run-down but it does seem like it isn't well-run and getting around is pretty confusing.  I was just meandering around to find my way to the petting zoo and also to locate the restrooms.  A word of advice to parents is to leave your stroller in the car- it isn't easy to navigate with a stroller- bring a baby Bjorn.  Also the deer kept trying to eat my stroller and tugged at my tank top to eat that too which wasn't appreciated but I was given fair warning from signage!  These animals in the petting zoo seemed pretty aggressive- one head-butted another woman who was with her children!"}
{"text":"First time been here. Restaurant looks really clean. And the waitress nice & active. I ordered Simon with rice & salad. Fresh and yummy. I hope I can visit here again in a day time. I can visit the zoo and see more views. Definitely will back here again."}
{"text":"So tranquil! I love it here. It's cool how you can feed the animals that are freely roaming around. Most definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Good family fun at this place.  Been here a few times throughout the years and it never disappoints. There is alot of history at this ranch. The petting zoo is always fun. The actors are great and passionate when doing their little shows throughout the day(Nevada Nick).  When they do the Posse show with the kids, they do a gun safety message which is incorporated into the show. It does get crowded on the weekend and holidays. Nice place to enjoy history, nature and the old west."}
{"text":"Es ideal para disfrutar en familia ver paisajes animales me encanta el tren  disfrutar en familia"}
{"text":"This review regards the saloon and restaurant only. The petting zoo and old-timey western shtick is fine, but the saloon is where it's at!

This fake old-west saloon is about 45 minutes outside Vegas, up in the mountains near Red Rock National Conservation Area. If you like FrontierLand at Disneyland, or if you like drinking in fake-rustic fake-saloons, you'll dig this place! If nothing else it makes a refreshing change from the douchebag-infested bars of greater Vegas.

Apparently there's an old showgirl named Bonnie who hangs out here sometimes, but she wasn't there when I visited. But there was an awesome fireplace, great burgers and lots of kooky ambiance...which is more than enough for me! 

Highly recommended -- check it out after a hike at Red Rock!"}
{"text":"Nice view of the mountains, cute place for families or if you like cheesey little old timey town set ups. I thought the souvenirs were overpriced,  but the cost to get into the little town/petting zoo was only $10. Beautiful banquet hall- would be a unique event spot!"}
{"text":"I am a definite fan!  Great family-friendly place to visit while in Vegas. We came on one of the hottest weeks but was lucky it was an overcast day with the occasional breeze. 

Fun train ride from the far parking lot. Beautiful surrounding mountains/hills. The conductor was cool. Before the train ride, he offered to take pictures for the riders. 

\"Hanging\" show was entertaining - we had a hoot! 

Stay away from the mine shaft if you have vertigo or prone to motion sickness.

There's a feeding area with hungry goats. Don't wear pretty clothes because the animals like to get a taste and leave some green saliva. 

We enjoyed an ice-cream float at one of their buildings (skipped the restaurant near the pond because they were very busy- maybe next time). 

We will try to make the horse ride our next trip (I think it's $65 dollars per person for an hour ride).

This is the old west and this place is quite old and a bit run down.  But so what!  It could definitely use your support/business. Instead of losing all your money at the casinos, spend a few bucks here (and don't forget to tip when you can).

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down. The petting zoo is awful, these animals are kept in tiny, dirty, run down cages. Please do not support this hell hole road side zoo!!!!! Seriously, think of it this way, would you want your dog kept in a cage that is barely bigger than them for their whole life?"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots to go as a little girl.   I went for the first time in a very long time,  and for the cost I feel it is a good deal.   It was Tuesday so the western town was not open although you could walk through it,  they are also dark on Monday's.  This was fine because my interest was in their animal sanctuary, which was only 7 dollars a person.   You enter the the western town to get to the ticket counter for the zoo,  and the entry is good for the whole day. 

They have redone this area from when I was younger,  it's a mixture of a petting zoo, and animals in their own caged habitats.   The animals walking around are deer,  sheep, a donkey,  ducks,  chickens,  and what appeared to be turkeys. They have feed machines and it's a quarter for a handful of food.   The deer usually will eat it out of the machine before you can attempt it with your hand.  The donkey will stand beside it and stair at you longingly while it occasionally makes very interesting sounds to get your attention. The sheep, well it truly is the black sheep of the family,  it just gets what it can until a deer nips its butt.  The deer will try to eat your clothes so watch out,  they are kinda punks. 

The animals they have are a truly random assortment.   The porcupine,  was one of the most fun finds for me.   It loved to climb,  and it was full on nuzzelying one of the volunteers in its habitat.   Also, they have a hybrid wolf that looks like something out of fiction.   The wallaby was also very surprising.   You will find some expected animals as well like pigs and pony's. None of those you get to pet though as far as I understood. 

Ideally it would be cool if some of the enclosures were larger and had a more developed habitat.   I would feel more strongly if this was a for profit facility.  I understand however this is a sanctuary for rescue animals that are a little more unique.  

Overall a fun place to visit.   I believe they also have horseback riding on the property,  and they have a American style food restaurant by the pond filled with ducks and turtles .   Just don't  trust the vending machine it ate a dollar and wouldn't give it back after apparently being out if everything. Shifty vending machine."}
{"text":"You really got us, Bonnie Screams. Got our money that is. If you're considering Bonnie Screams.. PLEASE READ!!!!

Waited in a very disorganized line for about an hour and a half to get tickets when we arrived around 7:45p.m. Be watchful for people trying to cut. Was excited because it was a Dark and old place.. So much potential. As the train pulled up, someone exiting yelled out to us that we should turn back around because it was the biggest waste of money. I should've heeded his advice and gotten a refund while I still could.

Train brought us into the town, which was composed of three haunted houses (if you could even call it a haunted house..), and one building for food and drinks. 
The first haunted house wait time was well over an hour. I came out livid. The only thing this \"haunted house\" had were light effects, mere decorations, and maybe 2 actors that popped out at us. They didn't even make sounds. No scare factor, not even scary sound effects or music was being played. Nada. Biggest disappointment. The other two \"haunted houses\" weren't much better. Only difference was that the actors actually screamed in your face and made more of an effort. But seriously, only about 2-3 actors per house?!?! 
Also, every employee that I encountered (at the start of each haunted house) seemed to be having a really really really horrible time. I felt bad that they hated their jobs so much. Most pleasant was the \"zombie bride\" walking around, who for a few minutes, adjusted her stilts in front of the crowd and told us her life story. Isn't there a \"backstage\" for that? 
Too add on, food and drinks were unimaginably long as well. Everything was too disorganized. 

The area of this place held soooo much potential and really brought expectations up.
Maybe the haunted houses here are directed toward very young children?? That would explain the lack of any scare factor. If so, the employees should cheer up or get into character a little bit more. 

TLDR: Waste of $25, haunted houses can't even be considered haunted houses, will spend your night in line and in disappointment. Employees are bitter."}
{"text":"I can't even give this place a one star.  Is there a ZERO for sub-below-zero-minus here??  This used to be my most fav place off the strip.  Until twice by the same rude Bartender Cassidy I was cut off after only a couple of beers like most everyone else was doing in there.  I wasn't causing any trouble, wasn't drunk, or doing anything wrong at all.  I thought maybe It was a mistake the first time when this happened, certainly she must have me confused with someone else, until shockingly it happened a second time by the same person.  After the second time this happened to me, I called and tried to talk to the manager April about it, she didn't seem to want to listen to anything, and she quickly told me,\" you can't come back here on the premises\".  She wasn't even there and made that decision based on here-say supposedly from Cassidy.  People can make or break a place.  The zoo and premises don't look well taken care of at all.  I don't ever want to go back there again, and did nothing wrong at all, and definately did not deserve this cold-mean-spirited treatment for no reason.  (And they will call the police on you as another person also has in their review, also the same).  I was also threatened with that to more of my surprise.  I left as fast as I could afterwards, and I was so glad to leave and get out of there.  I was afraid after that not knowing what else to expect.  I was in shock.  I have no intentions of ever going back there ever again.  I hope someone will investigate this place for the bad wrong way they are running and ruining what used to be such a nice fantastic place to go.  I think the police need to be called on them.  Then after the fact can you believe they had the further nerve to somehow get a pic of mine what looked to be a pic from FaceBook and post it on the restaurant bulletin board, and write under it my name, and your banned from these premises.  Someone told me about that.  The gall and raw crazy nerve of these people to do such a thing to a innocent person.  You'd think I really did something wrong in there.  They will reap what they sow.  I welcome everyone of you, to post your crazy scrupulous experiences here about this off-track messed up business.  I know that I'm not alone.  It's been told that this place is haunted.  No wonder there are ghosts and spirits that like to hang around this crazy place.  The management and staff are nutty."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs Ranch is a great place to bring the family for a day of fun! The Old Town costs $10 per person, and if they're under 12 years old it bumps down to $7 to enter. They open at 10:30, and I recommend getting there around 11am! I say this because if you're there you'll want to check out the three shows they have, and the first show starts at 11:30 and the next two shows occur one after another. There's a lot to see, and the kids can run around and check everything out! Old Town also has a space where you can have photos done and printed out for you! You get to dress up, and have plenty of choices and props to choose from! Although it can be a bit pricey to get done, it was a fun experience!There's also a small train that rides around the lot, and my son wanted to ride it again and again lol. Side note, make sure to wear tennis shoes! It's all dirt in Old Town and you're better off not ruining nice shoes!"}
{"text":"While in town for training, and staying with a family friend, I was introduced to this little gem of a restaurant in the middle of nowhere in the Red Rock portion of Las Vegas.  The Bonnie Springs Ranch is a wild west reenactment venue/zoo/eatery/arena for large events.  The restaurant is rustic and right out of the olden days. We stopped in for breakfast and I ordered Grandmas plate of two eggs two bacon country potatoes and a biscuit. Everything was very flavorful, service was excellent and cheerful. There was a pond right outside the restaurant which was full of turtles, I've never seen so many turtles in one place! A definite place to bring visitors who've never seen this part of Vegas."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs has been around forever! I remember my parents taking me when I was little and of course, I loved it. Well now, it's my turn to take my kids and they love it just as much and it's still a great adventure.

The main attraction for our 3 year old was the train, with the wristband (which covers entrance to the town, petting zoo and train) you can ride unlimited times (the 3 year old didn't hear that though ;) ) the train conductor was extremely friendly and even offered to take our family photo. It was freezing the day we went, despite being out in the cold weather he was still extremely pleasant.

On to the petting zoo, as you'll see in other posts, seriously, watch your clothing and belongings, the goats and deer mean business. If you pay attention - you can avoid missing fabric. But you can't help but laugh. Lots too see including a wolf, pigs, wallaby, Lynx and more. We all enjoyed it.

Last but not least hit the town up to watch their frequent live and interactive shows. We missed the main with the hanging but they did have a kid's mini show that involved the kids catching a bad guy. Loved it all.

{"text":"Had a really good time out here this past Sunday.. the petting zoo alone is worth 10$! The town obviously needs some work. Needs an update for sure. My only real complaint though is that the womens bathroom in the restaurant was the filthiest public bathroom I had ever been in! It was truly disgusting. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a week."}
{"text":"This is a must go if you are visiting Vegas. Its a drive of about 45 mins from the strip.
The food at the restaurant is fabulous and very fresh.
Their pulled chicken sandwich, BBQ ribs come with slaw and fires. The plates used to serve the food are made of metal, the decor of the restaurant and all the detailing make the experience a 5 star.
There are wild peacocks and peahens freely moving in the open around the restaurant.
There is a petting zoo, wild west shows, and beautiful red canyon mountains and much more you should go for!!"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 8/100

Be ready for a throwback to the Wild wild west, some creepy crawly (ghostly) tales and a lot of underrated fun here at Bonnie Springs Ranch - complete with a petting zoo (yes, you just read that) and a chance at learning the history of the Native Indians. 

Open through Wednesday to Sunday, for only $10 ($8 with certain promotional coupons), you get a chance to explore the 'old town', which, according to my friend, is made to stand from re-using real old town materials and rebuilt firmly to accomodate visitors/tourists. We ventured to the hang em' and shoot em' interactive show by the outdoor benches played by Angry Joe and Kyle (who also were the main casts for the Melodrama at the bar/saloon). It was a lot of laughs and people in the audience were picked out to play along. 

After that, we had to stay tuned to the wax museum-ish run through with Kyle which offered some interesting trivia on Bonnie Springs and the whys on Nevada being called the Silver State. Just about every corner of Bonnie Springs Ranch is a great angle for a picture and if you're lucky, you may even get a chance to see the burrows (who might've felt cold today and decided to hide out) Speaking of animals, don't forget to check out the petting zoo. The kids are gonna love it. From deers to rams to rabbits to lammas & even emus (and wolves!), with a wristband (which you get upon entrance), you are open to bask in these amazing wildlife. With an additional $0.25, you even get to grab a handful of food to feed the deer and boy were they lovable (and they sure loved to chew on my sweater!)

At some point, our tummies were grumbling for some food so we shuffled over to the Ranch's very own vintage country restaurant overlooking a large pond of mallards and occasional peacocks (it was quite a sight to see half the pond frozen over and the dunks taking their naps on the ice) Staff were nice and pleasant. The three of us shared a sampler that consisted of potato skins with cheese & bacon, beer brewed onion rings and chicken strips for $14.99. It definitely was filling for us considering we just came from 6-7 hour walk around Red Rock and the zoo and helped us cozy up from the freezing cold weather outside, all tuned to some good ol' country music. 

We stayed a bit for chats. Be wary that there hasn't been a lot of staff present (seasonal reasons) so one waiter/waitress may be tending to more than 3 tables. Just be sure to take your time with the orders and be patient if they can't come over to your table right away. This will give you a chance to enjoy your friends/family's company while you wait, as well as enjoy the view of the restaurant and the duckies (or turtles) outside. 

Fun place, lots of things to do and entertainment to keep you up for a whole day. Great side trip with some girlfriends, especially after a long hike."}
{"text":"If you drew a straight line South of the Spring Mountain Ranch State Park parking lot, you'd be in Bonnie Springs in the Red Rock Canyon National Recreation Area. Driving into Bonnie Springs is a similar experience to Calico Basin Road. It is two lanes with a hilly s-curve. Be alert! 

  If the road into the park was unpaved I'd pass over the visit. However, the general parking lot was gravelly & dirt. To drive on it without denting your car is like driving on an egg shell. 

  To reach the Old West Village you must board the train (runs on weekends). The park seemed to use the train  more of a tool to make sure you paid the $10 admission than entertainment. There is a sign stating you have to have your admission band to ride the train back. The conductor did not have the positive personality for the first and last person you see in the Park. He admitted to a guest he isn't a people person. There was no celebration of the Red Rock scenery. 

   The smell of barbecue from the restaurant greets guests at the Old West Village Station. When I paid the $10, I asked for a park map. The ticket clerk said there are no maps and the park is small. She was right on. 

  I walked into what looked like a western movie set. I passed a shooting arcade, school house, church, Petty Canyon, trade posts, and ended up at the Hanging show by the Opera House & saloon. Unlike the Town of Oatman, another nearby ghost town, most of these buildings were facades. The Marshall and loan buildings were closed off. The wax Museum is open at certain times during tours. 

  At the Hanging show, guests sit at picnic tables that are out of place when a sign warns against outside food in the Park. IMO the show fell short of entertaining. I'd pass on the Melodrama. 

  The Hanging is by the saloon where I exchanged $5 for an aluminum bottle of Michelob. The saloon is really a catering hall with a bar that was nearly empty during my visit. 

  My favorite area is the petting zoo. When you enter, there is a sign stating that you need the admission band. By the cat dolls another negative sign says something like, \"touch it, pet it, drop it pay.\" In the zoo there is a sign telling people they need to remember the exit. This isn't really a fun Park. But the animals were upbeat. The 2 pantagonian cavys were playing. Roosters hung out on rooftops. Prarie dogs charmed the crowds. People wanted to take the sheep home with them. The wolfdog which is 98% timberwolf & 2% dog seemed to want to be petted. But the existence of the tortoise seemed to be to try to escape. The zoo was clean and had the barbecue smell eliminating any nasty smell that comes with a petting zoo. 

  Petty Canyon would give a breathtaking view of Red Rock if a wooden fence didn't get in the way. Again, no celebration of Red Rock. 

  Outside the Old West Village, by the restaurant is a pond that is home to ducks &  turtles. It is an oasis in the desert. To the west are the horse stables & pony rides. 

  Growing up, I read of how the West was one. On the contrary, after a few hours at Bonnie Springs I learned that  this Old West was lost from a lack of enthusiasm for Red Rock Canyon, negativity pointing subtly toward a distrust of guests in all these signs, and the first and last person you see on the train not being a people person. I think I'll be spending time in the West North of here that is Spring Mountain Ranch State Park and Red Rock Canyon."}
{"text":"My daughter LOVED this place so much!!! Definitely worth seeing, the drive was beautiful, animals were all so cute and friendly! The actual petting zoo doesn't open till 10:30am we got there about 9:30am so we walked around, fed ducks and we actually ate at the restaurant inside Bonnie Spring Ranch, which was also amazing! Me and my daughter will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very short drive from Vegas. This is a little gem tucked away in the Red Rock canyon. The scenery itself is gorgeous. Upon arriving, you are transported back in time to the Old Wild West. Get ready to be apart of the action.
Great fun !!!!!!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars for Bonnie Springs Ranch must be a sympathy vote of support, or people were so awed by the view of the mountains that they gloss over what this place is. I've sat here and tried for over a week to write a \"nice\" review but I keep hitting delete, delete...so I'm going to try and write it again...if it posts it's because I finally gave up and just tossed it out so I can clear it off my review list. 

The list of things I can't stand about this place ranges from the condition of the entrance road and almost being hit head on twice getting in and out to rude staff trying to control parking. It got worse with every experience we had inside...and being fleeced for an admission charge that even by strip pricing standards is excessive for the little you get doesn't help. And don't even get me started on the \"melodrama\"....or the food \"service\", and the restrooms are why Purell to Go was invented. 

I could really write a scorcher of a review for this place but I'll stop and just say if you have kids, go once for the petting zoo. The animals are the saving grace for this sad, pathetic place which is best seen once through the eyes of a child. But I have no intention of going back and I sure won't take family and friends with kids from out of town there. For Pete's sake you're in Red Rock Canyon...there are a LOT of other things to experience than this. 

2 Stars....Only because the animals look well taken care of which is more than anyone can say for the rest of the place."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've read the worst of it and the best of it. Basically people, you have to set your expectations. At $10 per person this is not an overpriced place. It is also not the San Diego Zoo, it is a Roadside Attraction!!!! Something that you might have seen off Route 66 back in the day. So if you are into that kind of thing it is worth the visit. If you want something more stay in Las Vegas. I thought the people there were super nice and we had beverages and a nice restroom at the Bar. I don't know if the restaurant was open or not. We were there on a Friday afternoon. I thought the skits were kind of humorous and yes the place is very dusty, which to me just added to the nostalgia. What is for sure is that this location is incredible, with the Red Rock Canyon on the horizon, one could set up shuttles from Las Vegas and with some investment $$$, this place would be a huge success. Good Luck Bonnie Springs Ranch!"}
{"text":"Great place for a day trip....staff is great price is right although the place could use a little sprucing up. They even have a senior discount!!"}
{"text":"Such a short drive from the hustle and bustle of the city! You can enjoy the beautiful view of the mountains, wildlife, wild flowers, sunset and so much more. 
Bonnie Springs Ranch is a weekly escape for us for quick bites in the restaurant. 
Winter nights, it's awesome place to enjoy hot cocoa or sipping your favorite cocktail by their giant fireplace, or just hanging around the bar, listening the bartender's jokes, and posting dollar bills to the ceilings ...

There are many activities around here for families, for all ages.
Beautiful peacocks are all over this place. Also the little lake is home for many ducks and turtles.
For a quarter, duck food is available from the dispensers.
At the back of the ranch, you can find the petting zoo. It's so much fun for kids, all year long!
Bonnie Springs Ranch Petting Zoo is now for nonprofit! Donations are accepted. You can add extra on your restaurant bill, put a notice on it, and sign it. 

Also, horseback rides are available, too. I think, the weight limit is 250lbs  ...
It's awesome to watch the beautiful sunset from the trail.

On the other side of the ranch, their is an option to watch an old western shooting show. There is a minimal entrance fee for that.
Lots of picture taking opportunities!

Parking is available nearby on the dirt lot. Also more parking space in the bigger lot, little bit further away. But from there, you can use the train! It is so much fun!"}
{"text":"I guess I give this place 4 stars. I took my 2 year old here today, and it wasn't spectacular. I thought there was going to be more things to do.  We didn't stick around for any of the shows, due to her age, and I know she wouldn't sit and watch them.  She sure did enjoy seeing the animals and being able to feed them.  The driver for the train ride was a nice man.  She was so excited to ride the train, and he made it fun for her. I would not advise taking your kids here during the week since the train only comes out on the weekend.  The other bummer was you couldn't have a picnic.  Well....some people probably just don't want to eat at the saloon, and would rather take a packed lunch.  I don't get the reasoning. Possibly people would trash the place.  But other than that, I don't see any other reason why not."}
{"text":"Weve been coming here for years (3 times a month) but it seems the personal service has gone downwards:("}
{"text":"Steve was a great guide in our trail ride. Glad we went in the morning before it got too hot."}
{"text":"I love this place and I wish it was closer so that locals and those traveling to visit Vegas can experience the magic. It is clean and well kept. The staff here is very friendly and I think it's priced appropriately. I support anything pertaining to animals."}
{"text":"Bonnie Springs is a cute little town outside Vegas right next to Red Rock. We came a little later on a Friday night to have dinner there so we didn't get to see the petting zoo or the train in action. 

When my guy went to the restroom and came back telling me how \"cool\" the bathroom was, I was expecting a high tech looking like toilet. You never know what you can find in the middle of nowhere. You know what he showed me? An aged antique looking bathtub as a urinal with continuous water running. I guess that is one thing that makes me different from him, he's gross and I'm not  

We ate at the little restaurant there and the food was just average. Nothing to write home about but no complaints either. You can order from the breakfast, lunch, or dinner menus any time of the day. The service was quick and friendly and the staff was very knowledgeable about the animals on site and about the owner, Bonnie.

I noticed a lot of other Yelper's discussing how the animals looked sad and since I wasn't able to visit the actual petting zoo since it was closed, I can't say much but we did get to see Houdini the bull and he looked rather bored and sad. Also noted that this IS a non-profit. 

As a \"Vegas local\" I think this is one of the perfect places to visit if you are looking for a calm, serene environment because nothing about this place is commercialized like it is on the strip."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE MOTEL ONLY.   It is very outdated and overpriced.  Cheapest room is over 85 dollars plus tax.  Heater wasn't hot, the floor was stained, hair on the towels, in the bathtub, and it had a weird smell throughout the room. Was told by housekeeping they only wash the comforters once a month,  even though the other linen (towels, sheets) are changed daily. Rodent droppings were found in the bedroom dresser drawer!   My pictures should speak for themselves.  Stay far away from this establishment!"}
{"text":"Loved the beautiful trail ride. The tour guides were nice , helpful and friendly. The horses were so good and happy the whole way :) I've been begging. My husband to go horse back riding forever and it definitely made my day. After the trail ride we went back into the restaurant and cozied up next to the fire to get warm :)"}
{"text":"fun place to visit with kids, it has a small zoo, chicken and peacocks running around, they also have a bar & restaurant, worth a drive, about 10 min from red rock canyon"}
{"text":"I love coming here after a hike at Red Rock to sit by the fire or at the bar. We always get the corn fritters, so good. They also have a petting zoo and a fun and funky wild west show. Dont miss their halloween celebration every year."}
{"text":"Stood for 15 minutes waiting for a table for dinner. No greeting from the servers or hostess. We left."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to bring the kids to that's not to far of a drive from home. They have an awesome train ride , animals all over the property including a feeding and petting area, a small wax museum, a fun show, and a restaurant with great food. Highly recommend it if you've never brought your kids here before."}
{"text":"Cute Rustic mining town off of Blue Diamond on the way to Red Rock. Lots of motorcyclists stop here to hit up the small bar in the restaurant and take a quick break from their scenic drive. There is not much parking in the front lot during the weekends so it is best to part on the outer lot and take the small train into the 'town.\" The kiddos love the train ride as well and it is free to take in. The sign does say that they will charge a fee to take the train back, unless you can show you spent money at the restaurant or paid the admission fee to get into the town. Im not sure how much they really enforce this as we just walked back anyhow. 

The fee was $7 for kids, free for under 1 years and I forgot the charge for adults, I think its like $10 bucks. Pretty in expensive. We went in through the wheelchair area and no one even checked our wristbands. At no point did we ever get them checked actually except when we were entering the petting zoo. 

This is a horrible place to take a stroller or wheelchair. All dusty small rocks and lots of stairs. Hardly any ramps and a lot of lifting was going on. Also, make sure to wear tennis shoes because you get very dusty. 

We walked around and went through a mining house, a saloon, some shops and small museum. Everything is run down and not taken care of. This place has a lot of potential and with some money and some work, it could be a really cool Vegas attraction for even tourists. As a local, I don't mind paying the small fee to mosey around for an hour or two, but I would be highly disappointed if i came from out of town or from far to see the place. 

We had primarily come for the zoo as my son loves animals. The petting zoo was a zoo of people, packed. There were some animals roaming around including a deer, sheep and goats. You can pay $.25 to get some food for them. Even with all the people, we were able to put a few of the animals pretty easily. Again, make sure to bring quarters. Overall, its a small place and the animals seemed to be doing ok. I don't know of many petting zoo type places in Las Vegas, so this place is unique in that aspect. There is a sign that they are a non profit and accept donations and volunteers. 

In regards to the shows they put on. They had play guns that BANGED so LOUD we had to get as far as away as we could as we had our little one with us. It was way too loud in my opinion for kids. But there were plenty of kids that did not think so."}
{"text":"They do not accomodate service dogs. The blowhard owner at the bar is ignorant of the Americans With Disabilities Act and asked us to leave with the service dog, making up his own interpretations of the law. Owner has been reported to the Justice Dept, who will be setting him straight. Anyone with a disability should avoid this place."}
{"text":"Fun Day for everyone

Location: Just a hop, skip and a jump from Redrock Casino (10-15 minute drive) that takes you back into another time and place.  It's located in beautiful Redrock Canyon... just head west on Charleston Blvd and turn right when you see the sign for Bonnie Springs Ranch.

Bonnie Springs Ranch: has all sorts of fun things to do and you can easily spend several hours here.  There are 2 dirt parking lots (FREE) and if you park in the 1st large lot you can catch the cute little train for a 5 minute ride to the entrance area.  The 2nd lot is small and is located right in front of the entrance. There is the rustic cowboy style restaurant with a nice warm fire when you enter. 
Train Ride:  Cute, fun and Free
Horseback Riding:  I think it's around $60/hour per person. 
Zombie Shoot & Ghost Tours:  Each of these takes place one Saturday evening per month... They are both kind of pricey and we did not do these.

Bonnie Springs Restaurant:  Very Good!! The menu is classic American Food with Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  I had the Bonnie Springs burger with Corn on the Cob instead of fries. My  burger was perfectly cooked,  juicy and it came with Swiss cheese and bacon. It was served on toasted buttered sourdough bread and it was delicious!  It wasn't cheap but it is well worth the price.  They also have buffalo burgers and sometimes Elk too! The service was excellent and our waitress was friendly and saw to our needs for refills and keeping the table cleared.  Be sure to walk the grounds if you're here during the day and at no charge you'll see all sorts of animals such as their bull, ducks, peacocks, turtles and roosters.
Restaurant Hours:  Mon-Thu  9am-9pm   Fri 9am-10pm   Sat 8am-10pm   Sun 8am-9pm

Old Nevada:  We came here because my boyfriend had not been here before but personally I don't care for this part of Bonnie Springs.  It was $10pp and once inside this price includes their petting zoo, a melodrama (not my idea of funny... rather boring), a 'hanging' following the melodrama, a walk thru replica of an old mine (this part is kind of cool) some gift shops and a candy store that you would think has old time candies but not here, just the same kind you can buy anywhere."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas over 10 years and finally came to see what this place was all about. If you're planning on coming to this place, wear some shoes you don't care to get dirty. My shoes were filthy after walking around this place. Probably shouldn't bring your strollers either. 

My family and I ended up eating at the restaurant here. It was by the pond that had turtles and ducks in the water which carried the smell of... fart. Lol
Right when we walked in the restaurant, we were seated. The smell of the place was not pleasant. It turned me off and at that point I didn't feel as hungry. It kind of smelt like moldy old wood. I didn't feel comfortable because the table was sticky and the menus were dirty. My family really enjoyed their food. I ordered a grilled chicken Cesaers salad and the chicken tasted off. Had some sort of gamey taste. It had a stench that didn't smell right. Maybe it wasn't even chicken.

We ended up going to see some of the animals after we ate. Came across some ducks, peacocks and roosters. At this point, the smell hit really hard. I'm not being dramatic or anything but it smelt really bad to the point my nose felt like it was burning inside! I felt like my nose hairs were being burnt off. We had to leave since the smell was so bad.

Overall, this place didn't \"WOW\" me. I felt like I was in a different place in Bonnie Springs. Had an eerie feel to it especially in the restaurant and its bathroom. My mom and my kids did not like the bathroom in the restaurant. Everything in Bonnie Springs is like an old western town theme. Basically this place smells like poo. (I mean, there is a zoo) Reading all the reviews and actually going there for the experience wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"4 stars if you have kids.  Probably 2-3 stars if you do not...

I've come here for many years when I was much younger...lots of good memories here, coming with the entire family a few times every year or so.  Seeing everything in my later years have both positive and negative aspects.

The positive of course, is reliving those memories, walking those same steps, seeing the similar animals, the same shows with the gunfighters, actors, etc.  The actors stay in character for the most part, so you can talk to them around town, and they seem like they have fun at what they are doing.

The negative really would only be to see how dilapidated Bonnie Springs really is.  Don't expect anything fancy, commercialized, or even clean.  The bathrooms are some of the nastiest you will find, with tiny stalls and bathtubs to urinate in LOL.  

The animals look a bit sad, but that's kind of expected getting locked up around a place like this.  They are also pretty dirty and could use some TLC, but it is what it is.

But I can look past all these things when I see Soul's smile on his face!  I can imagine mine so many years ago, lighting up when I see the tiny donkey to pet, or all the turtles in the pond, the peacocks running around freely, etc.

It's a short drive, especially if you live in Summerlin or far SW.  Bring the kids and make memories of your own :)

Pics!  :"}
{"text":"Went to Bonnie Springs thinking that it was family-friendly. Our first indication that it was not going to be appropriate for our 7 yo daughter was the \"melodrama\". It was filled with crude sexual innuendos! Luckily, she didn't quite understand them. We left the salon where the show was playing. Next we went to a souvenir shop further down the way. There was a Tshirt with a bull with something on his face proudly, prominently displayed and the shirt said \"Sh** faced with Bonnie Springs Ranch logo. These are not things I would expect from somewhere that is advertised as being family friendly."}
{"text":"Very upset! For the Bonnie Screams part, I waited in a line for an hour and a half just to get a wristband. Then 45 minutes for each haunted house. I bought a pepsi and water for $7 and the water was tap water! Very upset!"}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite places. Note to city slickers heading out for a day of old west fun, they have animals. Therefore, the place smells like animals. If animal poo offends you, stay on the Strip. This place is not for you. The duck pond in front of the restaurant stinks. I own ducks, they are VERY smelly animals. Considering how many ducks are usually in that pond, I'm actually surprised it doesn't smell worse. This is how I know the staff are doing a great job trying to keep it clean, because keeping any area with ducks clean is a losing battle lol! 
I haven't eaten in the restaurant in years, simply because I only live ten minutes from there and it's cheaper to drive home to feed a family of five, but I do like to go in and grab something to drink while my kids feed the ducks. I love the old atmosphere, but I do think they could update it just a bit without losing that charm. 
I love the old buildings. I love the dusty smell of the old wood. I'm a true desert rat and I appreciate these things. I do wish more of the souvenirs were made in America. Locally made would be even better. 
As for the price, ten dollars is pretty dang cheap for a couple of hours worth of entertainment for the kids. Most people spend that much on coffee every day (not me, yuck lol). Animal feed, husbandry and veterinary care are very expensive. Not to mention having to keep people on staff for the town/restaurant/stables/zoo. This place probably barely brings in enough money to stay open. 

All this being said, I take my kids out there as often as I can. They love it, I love it, we're outside enjoying nature and seeing something that isn't on some form of screen so I consider it a win-win. I'm planning on going out again in the next few days since my kids are out of school on break."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I must say, this place is more enjoyable when there isn't much people. The second time around, it was a lot busier but we explored the place more. We were waiting on some family so we checked out some of the different shops and whatnot before heading to the \"petting zoo\". It was too crowded to enjoy seeing the animals but overall, having a few of the animals close up was quite the experience. I was a little scared so I was a bystander and watched everyone enjoy them, instead. And of course, be prepared to smell poop. Hehe. After the petting zoo, we went towards the wax museum and the little bar. I thought it was a cool thing for them to serve alcohol! Vegas...old Vegas...same concept. Ha! We met up with the rest of the family at the restaurant near the entrance and the kiddos got to feed the ducks and turtles. The service wasn't so great. It wasn't as busy but somehow, they were slow throughout the whole dining experience. She forgot to get stuff a few times and our table basically ordered fries and some drinks. We headed over to see the horses and ponies prior to the mini train ride that takes you to the additional parking lot. The kids definitely enjoyed that.

Overall, this place is definitely a must once in awhile or a lifetime...you pick. Other than the slow service at the restaurant and the other downside of the games not working, the workers were really in tune with the concept of \"old Nevada\" and were very friendly, as well."}
{"text":"This place feels run down, almost embarrassingly so.  The \"ghost town\" is starting to look like a real one because it feels like nothing has been maintained here for years.

 I'm not sure why, but that afternoon it was just our little group together with two employees -- \"Mad Dog\" and Joe. It was amusing how the two of them kept turning up every now and then in different incarnations -- first as sheriff and outlaw, then on stage for a short play in the bar, later as tour guides in the wax museum, and so on. We felt a little awkward being their sole audience, but it was also interesting to be able to spend more time with them. In the end Joe and I chatted for quite a while about how he had come to Bonnie Springs after retiring from his career in Brooklyn.

They recently raised their prices and I felt we really didn't get our money's worth here.

We would not have come here had it not been for our (local) friends, who chose it for our son. But in the end we enjoyed ourselves, and the scenery in the area (including Red Rock Canyon) was truly incredible."}
{"text":"This slightly hidden place is only a few minutes drive from Red Rock state park. You pay $10 to enter the town and zoo. 

As soon as you move past the rotating metal gate, you'll find yourself in front of a western-inspired town with little shops on both sides. In the middle of the town, there is usually a show going on and you can just participate casually anytime. We arrived as \"The Hanging\" was about to take place so we headed to the back of the town and sat on one of the wooden benches to view the show. It smelled of manure and dirt everywhere. Kids of varying ages were giggling and yelling all around me. I love it because I just fit right in!

The zoo gate is off to the side of the town. It's not really a big place but enough to keep you occupied for at least 40 minutes. I was super excited while petting various animals including a sheep, deer, llama, horse, goat, among other animals. I even managed to chase after two little chickens to try to pet them. 

There is a section to the left of the town with a huge pond full of ducks and turtles. This area is free so you can go to it if you wanted to eat at the restaurant and walk around the pond; or if you're in the mood for horse-back riding or just to hang around a dozen or so peacocks, this is also the place."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is cool. Its got history. Yes it's run down. But it's OLD... There is plenty of cool stuff to do here and see. Especially for Vegas. It's unique and odd.  I've read most of the reviews and the bad ones seem to be from uneducated, borderline ignorant people.  First the buildings are original. It also sits on a historic trail through Nevada. As for the fee, it's 10 dollars. What do you expect to get? The MGM wasn't built on 10 dollars. So I'd say this place is doing well for no money. Furthermore to those whom say it's too expensive well yes if you come only 2 days (Mon & Tues) during the week the town is dark. Do your research it's clearly stated online! Also the fee is solely for the petting zoo... Yes it costs money to take care of animals, so you may not get a whole lot out of the \"town\" but you are mainly paying to pet the animals. As a Seaworld \"lover\" myself I'd say your 10 dollars is going far here!

In the end, do your research before going places.  Parking is free! It's old cool, by the mountains, historic, and yes the BEST part is its not Vegas! If you want to sparkeling waterfalls pampering your rainbow attitudes while drinking and acting a fool, tossing millions away to pay your host GiGi's salary, Caesars Palace has rooms starting from 29.95..."}
{"text":"Third time we've been here and we still love it. The food is great. Cool place to hang out with the family and very relaxing to sit by the mountains."}
{"text":"Driving up to Bonnie Springs Ranch, you see the beautiful backdrop of the Rainbow Mountain Wilderness. The land is prickly with mesquite trees and a variety of cacti. 

For Halloween 2016, my in-laws wanted to take us and our toddlers to the petting zoo here. We didn't arrive until after noon which was a mistake not because it was crowded (it wasn't) but because the midday heat seemingly zapped the energy right out of some of the animals.

The nice girl at the entrance charged us only $7 per person - a Halloween treat?

The zoo was okay. Mostly clean. Not really set up for \"petting\" many animals except a mean rooster, a beat up peacock, and the annoying deer. You can reach through the fences and pet a handful of others. Bring quarters to buy some food if you don't mind pushy deer.

The staff is not engaging at all - at least if you have younger kids, I guess. They're too busy cleaning up and chatting with their friends who come in.

Wear comfortable shoes that you don't mind getting a little dust on - and leave the strollers and anything else with wheels in the car. The road coming in is paved, but the parking lot and most of the walking area at the ranch are not. Plus there are not many ramps. There is an outdoor sink well-stocked with soap and paper towels at the entrance/exit.

The train is operable only on weekends. Fail!

We missed out on the melodrama. Bummer because I like live shows even if they are \"cheesy.\" Didn't stay for the Halloween festivities, but it might be fun once they kiddos are a bit older. There is a restaurant next door with decent food and a nice bar with dollar bills hanging from the ceiling. The staff, though, is not all that engaging or attentive there either.

Lots of tourists and motorcyclists flock here. (FYI - motorcycles have a separate parking area with a few concrete slabs.) Red Rock Canyon is only five miles away from the entrance. 

Maybe the experience will be better next time.

{"text":"This is always a must go to when we come to Vegas, its so nice to get out of the city and come to a very positive happy place. We plan to stay at the motel soon! All the animals are adorable and well taken care of. I can't believe they had to tell people to not sit and ride on the turtle, that's disgusting people come on. Use your common sense. Poor turtle. Anywho I love this place and will always return!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time OR money on this place!  This place reminded me of the ghost town of Knott's Berry Farm, but a lot more sad.

Items to note:
- $20 per car of 6 people  (It's affordable, but still NOT worth it.)
- $7.50 pony rides 
- Some of the saddest gift shops I've ever seen.  Only 2 were open and their merchandise selection was pathetic.
- Kiddie sized toilets with a weak flush.  No soap or toilet seat liners in the restroom either!  Bring some hand sanitizer!  
- Entertainment shows consisted of 2 actors/performers in the \"Saloon\" in the town square.
- Train was non operational when I went.
- Not friendly to disabled guests.  No pavement or asphalt, so disabled guests may have a difficult time walking.
- Don't use the wooden handrails, because you may get a splinter!

This was my first and last visit to Bonnie Springs."}
{"text":"Very cute place with a petting zoo. We drove here and the view is beautiful. Everyone was very nice too. They put on a couple of cowboy shows during the day. They are very kid oriented. They had a few stores and some antics on display. 

It's a cute place and you can have a nice time with family."}
{"text":"This place was so fun! If it wasn't 100 degrees out, I would have stayed all day. I love the whole theme, props, and actors. It's as if you are back in time. Plus the view of the mountains in the background is breath-taking. 

We took lots of pictures. The petting zoo had to be my favorite. Most of the animals are free range which was cool. But watch out for the deer eating your clothes. They literally had a mouthful of my dress in their mouth. There was also wolves, donkeys, a pig, etc. I liked that they had a sink with actual soap and water as we left the zoo. Btw, the bathrooms were very clean too! 

We also watched a showdown and a melodrama which was cheesy but entertaining. If it wasn't so hot, I wish I could have stayed for the hanging and wax museum. 

To end, we took a short train ride with the baby which put her fast asleep! 

Overall, this place was a ton of fun. I would love to go back and spend the whole day there when the weather is nicer. 

Oh, and coming in we were stopped in the middle of the road by wild donkeys. So cool!

The only con was the over-priced Costco water bottles. It was like 2 bucks when I normally buy the whole case for 3. It was a lot. I did not eat there so I can't say how much the other food was. 

The other con was the amount of flies there was. They would constantly be on us! I would definitely recommend bug spray!!"}
{"text":"I may sound like a dork for saying this, but this is one of my favorite places that I've been since moving to Vegas. When it was warm out I went hiking at Red Rock all the time and discovered this gem when I drove by and saw a little western town with a donkey and a peacock out front...I mean, how could we not stop? I somehow got roped into a live hanging demonstration (no pun intended) and toured a famously haunted wax museum, but best of all an old time saloon with an amazing view better than anything on the strip...in my humble hippie opinion. Went back for their haunted \"Bonnie Screams\" for Halloween too-had so much childish fun! If you haven't been I recommend an afternoon there when the weathers nice, its like a live adventure museum for the Wild West! (that's only $10/person to get in)
I just wish they took better care of the animals in the petting zoo cause they look mangey, and the sign \"please don't put your kids on the animals\" worries me cause that means someone was dumb enough to actually do that."}
{"text":"Fun and unique place that's only about 40 minutes from the Vegas Strip. It's a recreation of an old west town complete with a bar that hosts a melodrama show and they have hangings out front. The bar is huge but the place was almost empty during the week, the bartender said they are packed on the weekends. The bar doesn't have a great selection but you're really there to see the show. The melodrama is ultra cheesy and it's supposed to be so think more of someone joking around than a serious show. The hanging show out front is entertaining too and even better than the melodrama. If you sit up front you may even end up as part of the show!

They also have a little wax museum that's open for a few minutes after the hanging show. It's a little creepy but worth a quick walk through. They also have a small zoo where you can pet some of the animals. The animals should probably be in larger enclosures but they do what they can. There are also some gift shops that might be worth a quick look and the woman in the shop was really friendly. 

This place is interesting and worth checking out and spending a couple hours."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out there was a ranch out here in Las Vegas
Mainly because we don't have zoo's here or they're closed down.
Anyways, I decided to bring my parents and brothers here for the weekend 
for our family day. When we got there we parked in the first parking lot where there was several people waiting for the train.... it never came so we decided to go to the parking lot that's closer to ranch. The parking lot is way to small and hard to find a spot lucky for us a car was leaving so we were able to take his spot.

The view of this place was amazing with the old western scenery. We walked over to pay to get in the ranch the cashier didn't make no eye contact and refused to look up when I was talking to him... I thought that was rude. As we walk in we look around at the old town and made our way to the petting zoo there was goats, chickens, donkeys and deer's walking around I thought it was nice, but the fact that those animals looked very sad and sick made me want to leave. My dad is experienced with animals he came across a donkey that had it's head down he went over to pet it and as he was petting it he said that the donkey needed medical attention he said that his neck was swollen and that it wasn't normal for it to look and feel like that. The workers there looked angry and very unhappy. Usually from all the zoos I had been to the workers interact with the young children and are always smiling. Well that's NOT the case here.

The shows were funny at times but I think they should consider getting a female actor to play the woman in the play instead of having two males one half dressed as a woman....that sounds like a man when he's suppose to be a woman...? Jesse was the only actor I liked from the hanging play. He was the star! 

The gift shop was nice the young man was very friendly and I was able to ask him all the questions I had earlier about the place and got answers for all of them. 
He was probably the only one who was happy and very helpful.

The Saloon Was empty there was a sign that did offer drinks hot dogs and other type of snacks. Well they didn't have any of that besides soft drinks, chips and Ice cream and of course the alcohol. The lady was the most rudest from all the workers.... the way she treated others and then there was me maybe because of my color? Who knows... her attitude was wow.!

Well overall my experience wasn't the greatest there for I don't think I would recommend this place or come back here again. I just want to thank the young man at the gift shop for being friendly. I wish I could of gotten his name and for Jesse the funniest actor there that made me laugh!"}
{"text":"Very, very cute. The kids love the western show, can touch and feel all the old west stuff as they walk around. Even the zoo has small animals. No paved streets, so bring dusty walking shoes , sunscreen, mosquito repellant. Fun afternoon with grandparents and kids."}
{"text":"Went to Bonnie Springs for my third time taking my daughter's friend who has never been there before. The weather was just perfect for the drive to Red Rock area to the little town of Bonnie Springs.  When I came in the past on a weekend they used to charge per car, but now they charge $5.00 per person which is really not that expensive.  That gets you into the Zoo and the Old Towne.  The train conductor seemed a little stressed having to collect money and drive the train, but once we got going and the kids were waving to passer byers he seemed to lighten up and enjoy it.  The kids LOVED the train ride.  We first went to see the ducks and the turtles.  The odor was really bad from the water, but that didn't mind the kids.  A few adults hit the bar for a beer while we took the kids around.  We saw ostrichs, birds of all sorts, horses, then to the zoo which is now a 401C non-profit group managing it which I am happy about.  They have changed the way the pens are arranged and it seemed smaller, but I love it and so did the kids even though my daughter had to run when a goat was chasing her for food.  Too silly!  The Old Towne gift shops don't have a lot of inventory and prices seemed high.  What I loved was the Melodrama and the hanging.  The actors really liked what they were doing and it made for a great show.  There are so many \"Kodak\" moments here at Bonnie Springs.  I just love what they have done with the place.  So, if you can deal with a little maintenance issues and not enough staff and look past that this is a great place to bring out of town guests for the little ones.  Warning:  Do NOT wear a tie in the restaurant - they will cut it off and hang it from the wall."}
{"text":"In the continuing effort to find the \"unique and unusual\" around Vegas and slightly beyond, my adventures led me to this place for an event.

Don't be surprised if you're driven past this on your travels to Red Rock.  You wouldn't think much about it, but the ranch itself is charming.  My first impression was met with the charming and wild (yet semi-tame) burros that wander around, and will greet you in hopes that visitors will offer them a treat.  I'm not going to lie: I brought one celery and named him \"Stanley\", of which he did not object to either option.

The ranch itself looks like something out of the late 1800's or an Old West movie set.  There's plenty of little shops and eateries (I've heard the main restaurant is really good, though I've yet to try it), and it's a pretty area to walk around and get lost in.

There's also a train to ride back and forth from the parking lot, and a petting zoo for the kids.  There's even a hotel (again, another thing I hadn't tried), but still interesting to find all of this out in the middle of nowhere.

I haven't seen any of their live shows, but the staff that I met were very friendly and accommodating.  I'll have to go back one day when the whole event is in full swing to experience everything properly.

It's a neat place, very quiet, and certainly very different from the majority of the \"tourist\" fare out here.  If you want a little out of the way place to explore that looks like it's from a different era, you'll have found what you're looking for here."}
{"text":"This ranch has the potential to be really cool and a lot more fun than it actually is.... After all, they have a train and a petting zoo!  Anyways, we went here a few days ago, just two adults looking for something different.  It was $10 for a wristband to get in and once we did it looked like an old deserted western town.  There were maybe 20 more people to come in after us and head to the saloon for the show.  Two staff members put on a few interactive, child friendly, old fashioned comedy skits for about an hour or so.
After the show we visited the \"petting zoo\", which is inappropriately named.  All of the animals there are caged and impossible to pet.  A few could even be heard growling and covered in flies and feces.  It really seems like this place is understaffed and underfunded, and could use some financial help and more volunteers.
The stores are full of cute old-western knick-knacks, most of which come with a lovely \"made in China\" sticker.  I was sort of disappointed, thinking their gift shops would come with at least hand crafted local items.  They do accept credit/debit cards, though, and everyone was very friendly.
I don't see myself returning any time soon, maybe for Halloween.  However, if anyone is looking for volunteer opportunities, this place could really use it!"}
{"text":"I really want to write a good review today, but i have not had any great experiences latley. If you have have read any of my other reviews you may have ran across McKee Ranch.. This is kind of the same theory. You pay $20 per car load to go in and get to see the shows and take part in the western extravaganza.. Again.NOT the case. We got on the little train since the lady working the front said it is a great scenic ride. We went from the front gate out to the other parking lot and the conductor got out and asked the people waiting for thier $20. And back to the gate.  We then walked into the western town they have set up and went to catch the 12:30 Mellodrama. my review on that is 
\" DONT DO IT\". 2 guys 1 fake beard, a dress and cow bell... enough said. We then walke over to the petting zoo that they have. Yeah they have a few animals, no they are not in good health and no I would not go back to see it again. Look at the pictures i have of this place and you will see the wite tailed dear that was shivering in a corner and it was plainly obvious that this poor animal was suffering. I dont think i will be going back to this place to see any of the western attractions."}
{"text":"Rip-Off. Sad, faded, third rate roadside attraction. We went recently and four of us paid admission only to find that most things were closed down and barely any staff. Went to the bar and had some warm, lousy beverages and split. If I had not been with my family I would have demanded our money back and pulled the idiot cashier through the window.

Save your money and stick to the natural beauty of the desert."}
{"text":"Went hiking on red rock and saw this place on the map. It's such a cute place! We loved every second of it! The petting zoo was so much fun. Wax museum was a great place. Very interactive place. We got to ride the train, the conductor was wonderful!  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"We went today with our 6 year old grandson and our two adult daughters. It's a fun day out, not too expensive and we really enjoyed the petting zoo. The animals were all well kept, friendly and clean. The site is an old ghost town and it was really cool to wander around, there were cowboy shoot out melodramas which were cheesy but the kids there LOVED it. They have a little train which was fun and our grandson was enthralled. A super fun, low key place to spend some family time. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Call ahead. Good to show early. Find out when the events are all working, the train ride for the kids. It's not every day. 

To get there: Take Charleston Bl, West, past the Red Rock Canyon sign. Beautiful views all the way to Bonnie Springs Ranch sign. It's on your right coming from Summerlin or the strip. 

Been there several times. Kids love the place. Peacocks walking around. Huge turtles - 100's of them, free to see animals. Pony Rides also. Serve a nice breakfast, get there early. Good pancakes, eggs, bacon, the works. Clean! Has that Old West feeling. Interesting photos to take in the restaurant. Many couples come minus the kids. Nice bar.  Probably a fun place on weekend nights. Have to try it. Ride would prove spooky at night. Came on a motorcycle once, many motorcyclist show up from time to time, special parking. Fun ride. Views spectacular. Place sits at the foot of the Red Rocks.  (Who with a Bike doesn't take the evening ride into the Red Rocks when you can?) 

 I am provoked to write this review by a remarkable young lady who works with the animals. Her name is Megan (so many spellings I hope I picked right.) Yes, to meet Megan you have to pay a little extra so you can enter the zoo portion of the park. Again, kids love it. Well, worth it.  Real goats, donkeys, sheep, so many animals to name, that are walking around like they own the place. Bring quarters! You buy them food and hand feed them. If you don't have any friends, you'll make one here. 

Also, have many animals that you can feed over or through their fenced-in areas. Beautiful miniature white horse, I mean, unicorn beautiful, and many exotic animals.

Okay, Megan, sweet Megan, always wanted to work with animals and sees this in her future. Turns out she's from New Jersey. They have wolves - yeh, that's right, Lycans. Look like very huge dogs, but no they're Wolves and they look at you like they know you're not. Megan from Jersey walks into their rather large fenced off area with large portions of meat to feed them. Something many would hesitate to do. (Imagine call for times.) After hand delivery their food, she takes that moment to fade away and leave. It was adorable to watch hungry wolves torn between - running back and forth - having to choose from eating their dinner or playing with Megan. Like true Lycans they love people from New Jersey. One started howling when she finally left the cordoned-off area. Megan took the time to talk about the animals. She made the visit that much better. She really knows her animals. Thanks Megan!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!  Keep in mind I have a 3 year old that has yet to go to the zoo.  This place was his first experience with some animals.  There was horses, sheep, bulls, peacocks, parrots, duck pond, dear and many more.  We got on the train ride, it was cute!  The shows not so much.  If you want to get out of the vegas heat for a while it is usually much cooler here as well.  I think it was pretty cool and a different experience.  so FYI:  IT's NOT A ZOO, NOT A THEME PARK, ITS A HISTORICAL LOCATION. (little run down)."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time since I was a child ..... Sad to say this place sure has gone down hill . It's been 20 years since I've been there and honestly I won't be going back . Was disappointed because I was telling my girlfriends kids about it and wanted to show them .... Kinda reminds me of that scene from \"hot tub time machine \" this place has turned into \"Kodak Valley \"

Don't waste your time coming here .... Sad to see this place went south so bad ... Kinda surprising really because there were a lot of people there . You'd think they would fix it up"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love bringing my family here. It's super cheap. There's a petting zoo which is a lot of fun. They put on western shows and they have cool restaurants. It's a really cool experience and I highly recommend. I've never tried them on Halloween but I heard it's really cool too"}
{"text":"No restaurant here.  No bar.  Not even a water fountain.  The sign is deceitful. 

You can park for free during the week.  If you have kids or something it might be fun to take pictures and stuff next to the mock Western style buildings and paintings of people with the heads cut out.  Other than that it's just an aggravating rest stop."}
{"text":"This location is a sweet Get Away that is 20 minutes from the busy Las Vegas Strip. The sky and air is clear filled with stars and only the sounds of the animals and nature fill the air at night. I love the nostalgia of this place. I got a room where the carpet looks like a wood floor and the room is large. It is peaceful and feels like your on a vacation with no one else around. The Old Town is awesome and has stories of ghost hauntings. Great place to bring your kids for history and entertainment. Everyone is nice here. This is a great place to get away from the city. I live in Hollywood and from Texas so I appreciate this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Bonnie Springs Ranch. My daughter had a great time running around and engaging in the mini shows, feeding the animals at the petting zoo (next time we need to ride the train). We had wonderful service by Victor at the saloon. And we took MANY pics which contained orbs in the pictures. They were everywhere! My daughter at one point called out \"the children\" to play from the schoolhouse and we then took a picture of her on a merry go round and there were TONS of orbs around her. It was definitely, an interesting few hours."}
{"text":"This place is fun for kids and adults. My daughter and I first started with riding the train in to the little town. It is free to ride in but you will need a wristband or a receipt $25+ from the restaurant in order to ride back to the outer parking lot. (don't forget to tip the driver, he is awesome!)

We did get there a little late so we only had time to eat and check out the petting zoo. We enjoyed feeding the animals (sheep, goats, donkeys). They were all very friendly. There isn't a large range of animals to see but it was still awesome. The peacocks outside were very pretty.

We walked briefly through the town but again due to time, we weren't able to see the different shows that they have there. We will definitely go back at a earlier time on the next visit."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend this time. The staff are what make this place great!  I mean, how in the world did they get people to dress up like zombies and allow tourists to shoot them with paint balls?  Seriously.  This happens here.

I upped my rating just because of the staff.  (Excluding the entrance guy who sent us to a really far parking lot to wait for a train that never actually came...and the train guy who never ran the dang train who saw us coming and decided to go on break both ways) All else still stands.  They need to fix stuff.  The cowboy players literally were doing maintenance on the explosive tricks between shows.  Things broke when walked on..like the mystery mine.  The wax museum is closed except for a brief walk through...no tour...because people were so bored they broke stuff...but that is kind of to be expected if you charge admission to a place where everything is falling apart or broken.  People just get frustrated.  Not justifying it, just explaining why crap like that happens.

Besides...it has to have been like decades since anything was properly repaired in there.  Maintenance and repairs happen.  In 10 years time...if things continue like this...I highly doubt this place will be still standing."}
{"text":"It was cool to go to and look at all the old buildings. Once we went into the part where all of the animals were it was awful. All the workers looked like they had been on drugs and all of the animals seemed unkept and malnourished. Really depressing conditions for all of the animals. I seriously doubt that the animals are getting any expert care. I wish there was a zero stars option."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid. 
Yeah it smells like animal shit its a ZOOOOOOOO! Do you think the animals shit smells like  potpourri?

I am glad this place exists! I am glad they take care of the animals and love them. I have been there recently and they have added a lot of new stuff and remodeled a lot. I love it anytime of year, especially when it starts to get cold outside! This place carries  memories of my childhood and family.
 
I stayed the night once when I was a little kid. My dad had worked there for a short time, I will never forget waking up to the rosters and chilly air. Some of us can only remember a few things from our childhood, and that is one of them for sure!

Anytime I meet a new friend I ask then if they have been to Bonnie Springs. There are no petting zoos in Vegas that care for their animals after so many years like this place.

The saloon is cozy in the winter when they have the fire going. 

Love you Bonnie! Thank you for loving all the animals!"}
{"text":"Went to Las Vegas for business but was able to sneak in a trail ride at Bonnie Springs while I was there. Super easy to get to, short 30ish minute drive from my hotel on the strip. Free parking (amazing in and of itself in Vegas) and a pretty, rustic feel. Located in the beautiful Red Rock Canyon, the view is hard to beat. The price (60 dollars per person for an hour) for the trail ride is more than reasonable given you are in Las Vegas. As a horse owner myself, the condition of the horses is always my first concern and the Bonnie Springs horses look AMAZING! They are all in great shape (some almost too fat! lol), have well cared for feet, quality saddle pads, and fitting saddles. What more could you ask for! Our guide was very sweet and funny, and also very knowledgeable  about the area and our horses. Overall a splendid experience and I look forward to coming back and bringing my own horses next time!"}
{"text":"Very cool place to take kids between 2-8 years old. 
Opens at 10:30am. They offer a trolley ride, petting zoo, outdoor shows, a restaurant, small gift shops, and even a little motel. 

Even though it's a few degrees cooler in the mountains, it's still Vegas, and it's still HOT most of the year! That being said, remember to wear a hat or sunglasses, carry ice water, and wear sunblock. 

If you're expecting the glitz and glamour of \"Vegas\" you will not find it here. Instead there are wondering peacocks and chickens, Cowboys and guns, dirt roads and animal poo. 

Parking is free, but purchased wristbands are required to get in. BRING QUARTERS to buy food to feed the animals. They will eat it right out of your hand, it's so cool!"}
{"text":"Visited Bonnie Springs in early October. My wife had been years ago but I had never been so we decided to check it out. We had lunch and did the horseback ride.

Lunch:
It was ok. Service was a little slow and food was just ok. I wasn't expecting gourmet given this is a ranch after all but I was expecting some good home town cooking and we definitely were not impressed. I would say eat before you come.

Horseback Ride:
This was just plain boring. I was at least expecting some great commentary from the guide. He was a tried and true cowboy, nice guy, but not really a great people person. We rode the horses in a big circle next to a small mountain range and it went on forever (ok it just felt like forever, it was an hour as promised). My wife's horse fell forward down to it's knees and nearly threw her off and my horse wouldn't stop and ran into the horse in front of it to which that horse resonded with a kick (which hit the bottom of my foot). Had that kick hit my toes or ankle this would have been a very terrible experience.

All in all I would say if you have kids this is a good experience but for us it wasn't worth the drive....."}
{"text":"This is a fun/family friendly event as long as you stay out of the side room at the saloon(it has nudie paintings you may call art if hung in a studio somewhere other than a bar)

The petting zoo was a delight for my teenager and her mother. They both fought over who was going to feed the animals first and loved being able to get up close and personal with some exotic and funny looking animals who desperately could use an orthodontist.

We did see a few gun fights and even watched a parlor show that was all geared toward a younger audience. 

I know they offer group packages and rent out the place for big corporate/private events and I would hope they would offer an \"R\" rated version of the shows for them.

We got chased out by a crazy rain storm but we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Bonnie Springs for over 25 years. I absolutely love visiting the ranch. It's a family tradition to go there; every year. Since I've been visiting Bonnie Springs for so long, I've seen the changes that have been made. 
I'd give this place 5 stars if the owners didn't decide to hike the prices up so high! It's $10 for an adult to get in and $7 for children ages 1 to 12 years of age. 
Now, I so realize that there are animals that need to be taken care of, and I do know Bonnie Springs is non-profit, however, work with us, please! I'd pay for an Annual Pass. Even $200 for one year is something I'd be willing to pay. 
I don't think Bonnie Springs is taking into consideration how much gas it takes for us to get out to them. 

We have 5 children. $55 dollars to get into the Old Town and Zoo is nuts. Here's why I believe that is just too high. 
First off, once you're inside the Old Town, there isn't much to do. Yes, there are old buildings with neat antiques, etc. but for the most part, you walk around and hope the kids find more entertainment once in the zoo. 
At the back of the Old Town, there is a building with a bar. They sell alcohol, soda, water, cookies, chips, and more. Thank goodness they do b/c by time you get to the back of the town, the kids are bored. 

Okay, so, the building with the bar in the back of the town. 
They put on a skit inside of the place. It's supposed to be similar to how people entertained each other before we had movies, TV's, etc. The 2 man skit is actually pretty funny. My 4, 5 and 7 year old enjoy watching it. The skit lasts about 15 minutes. Maybe 20. 
On to the next skit. This is the \"Hanging.\" It is done outside, at the back of the Old Town. Again, it's a 2 man show. It represents what a hanging would be like back in the late 1800's. It is actually very comical. Our kids do enjoy it. That show lasts about 20 minutes as well. 

The Wax Museum. It's not open to the public as a \"come and go\" type of thing. They do tours. It's pretty neat. You get a small history lesson and you also get to see some
Creepy wax people. The kids love it. 

I should have mentioned the stores. There are a few stores where you can buy trinkets. T-shirts, necklaces, stuffed animals, etc. There are some pretty cute items. Pretty pricey though. 

Okay, the Zoo. One of our favorite parts! 
While not that big, the zoo is just big enough to be able to spend about 30 minutes checking out and feeding the animals. Most of the animals are in cages, but a few are walking around. Waiting for you to feed them a treat. 
There are some amazing animals to see. My favorite are the linx. 
The horses are gorgeous too. 

My kids' favorite thing to do up at the Springs is actually Free. There is a duck/turtle
Pond in front of the restaurant. Yes, there is a Wonderful restaurant at Bonnie Springs too. We either eat at the restaurant and let the kids feed the ducks, or go inside the town/zoo. We can't afford to do both. It's such a bummer too because I love the whole place. 

The restaurant has a wonderful menu. The staff is great! There is a roaring fireplace and the smell alone is worth the drive up to Bonnie Springs. 
Ever tried a Bison burger? Well, you can at this restaurant. It's fantastic!!! There is live music some nights, right inside the restaurant. It's great. 

Last but not least, they have a train ride. If you have a little one that loves trains, they'll love the train ride. It does cost $$$. 
Also, our absolute Favorite time of year to go to B. Springs is during the month of October. The old town is decorated and made up to be all spooky for Halloween. It's called \"Bonnie Screams.\"
Bonnie Screams is great!!!! 3 haunted houses, a haunted trail through the desert at night, and yummy snacks available for purchase. It's just a great time. I believe it's $20 per adult.

Bonnie Springs does offer horseback riding lessons. Etc. You'd need to call to find out about that. 
There is also a little hotel at Bonnie Springs. I'd like to stay sometime. I'll
Update my review afterwards."}
{"text":"Definitely a Throwback Thursday kind of place in Las Vegas.  I probably would never have visited had my mom not come for a visit, and we went for a scenic drive in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.  We decided to take a left after exiting Red Rock to see what else is out there.

Not too far down the road is a sign for Bonnie Springs Ranch.  So we made a right turn. After a short drive down the narrow road, you get to a dirt lot where you are supposed to park.  Surprisingly there are a lot of cars (30+) for a place I still think is near the middle of nowhere.

As we walked up, there is a miniature train taking guests somewhere.  We walked past the \"old town/ghost town\" that required admission tickets for entry and to see the zoo. Further down, we saw a peacock. Yes, that bird with the beautiful tail features (well, the males anyway). Then two more. Some ducks flew past heading in for a swim in the little pond, which is next to the restaurant.  As we walked further in, we saw a whole flock of peacocks. It was like a whole lifetime worth of peacock sighting in a span of under 5 minutes. That was worth the drive all by itself.

Check them out if you want something less typical to do or if you are down the road hiking Red Rock. It is not the most awesome place on earth, but it is a family-friendly spot that time seems to have mostly forgotten."}
{"text":"Went to Bonnie Spring with some friends after a hike at Red Rock on a Saturday afternoon.  Here were some notables from our trip:

-Parking - It's absolutely confusing and horrendous on a busy day. There are like 2-3 gravel lots with no designated spots and narrow one way driving paths.  We gave up and made up our own parking spot by the fence and just prayed we wouldn't get towed.
-Bar/Restaurant outside - SUPER busy.  We opted to sit at the bar hoping to get faster service since there was a line building for the tables with no host/hostess in sight.  Wrong choice.  The bartender was also selling horse-riding tickets and we ended up waiting over 20 minutes drinkless and foodless.
*However, when we did get service, the Bloody Marys were awesome!!  Spicy and unsuspectingly strong.  The sampler platter was yummy too, just enough food for 3 semi-hungry girls after a hike.
-Old Nevada - It was cute inside.  It smelled like manure, but what did I really expect? Great for kids and photo ops!
-Petting Zoo - It was a lot of fun, even for 3 grown adults.  I don't know why, but I loved the mini-horses.  The kids seemed to have a lot of fun.  I like that some of the animals were out and about walking around with us while others were in cages.

Overall, it was a fun experience.  I'm glad I did it once.  I could see families and tourists coming out here and having a good time.  Definitely worth doing at least once."}
