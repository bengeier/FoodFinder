{"text":"We bought chicken and kafta wraps. Very dry and absolutely not made with love... You're better off going elsewhere. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before purchasing... I might just have stumbled on the wrong day, with a wrong cook in the kitchen, but man the food was bad..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today to get lunch, when I got there, the place was super smoky. Should have been my first sign. Then the fire department showed up and they rushed them away stating it was just smoky from all the kabobs they were making. The lady was very nice, told me they had a big to go order, and what would normally take 7 minutes to make, would now be more like 10. Sure, no problem. 45 minutes later, I got my order. 5 super thin slices of gyro, with a plate full of rice. The gyro was overcooked, hard on the ends. Not like the crispy delicious part from being on a grill, but hard. Not a good value for the money, not quick service. The only positive thing about the place was the friendly waitress. Save your time and your money!"}
{"text":"If you value your time or your money, GO ELSEWHERE. I stopped by to pick up something quick, thinking I was going to Ali Baba's. Upon arriving I learned that what was once Ali Baba's is now a new restaurant with new management. I ordered a shawarma sandwich, assuming that it would be the quickest thing to make, given that in all my restaurant experiences a shawarma sandwich typically takes 5-10 min (keep in mind there are ZERO people inside the restaurant, I'm the only one ordering.) It took 25 minutes, and upon complaining that I was now extremely late to work, the new management made NO EFFORT to remedy the situation (no refund, offer to comp a future meal, nothing.) I'd also like to note that the beef shawarma sandwich was $5.99, and I was charged $1.08 in tax. The tax rate in Phoenix 8.6% meaning tax should have only be 51 or 52 cents!! I WAS CHARGED ALMOST 20% FOR TAX! I'm all for supporting halal restaurants, but when the business is not run in a \"halal\" way it is EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. I wish I was able to write a better review, but sadly, I had a terrible first experience at Ya Sham Grill & Bakery."}
