{"text":"Love the jerk chicken sandwich and jerk chicken dinner. The roti is not always fresh so I would stay away from it, but the jerk chicken and beef patty are amazing."}
{"text":"I have been going to Allwyn's for the longest time but this is the first time at their new Yonge location.  Like always, they have the best Jerk in town which keeps me going back for more.  I've tried a lot of other Jerk places and no one has a better tasting Jerk so far! I will always be a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good.  Been eating here for the past 15 years or so. Its been open eversince I remember. Their jerk chiken/pork sandwich are excellent.  Patties good too. If in the area give it a try, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"This is one of those rare places where the emphasis is only the food and nothing else. There's nothing fancy about this place. Just plain and simple mouth watering food served at this small little place. I have been going to this place for 16 years on a regular basis. I even used to travel all the way from Richmond Hill just to get a hold of a couple of jerk chicken sandwiches on that specially prepared coco bread. The food at Allwyn's, especially the jerk chicken sandwiches, is 'highly addictive' just like the part owner C.K. will warn you during your first visit. I don't know how they do it, but some argue that it's even more addictive than crack cocaine! so be warned.  The jerk chicken has a perfect balance of aromatics (notably cinnamon, nutmeg, garlic, lime, allspice and thyme), brown sugar, and spiciness. And it's always fresh and very juicy.  Also try the homemade patties and buy yourself a loaf of the raisin bread. This place also has the best raisin bread in the city. And most items are around 4 bucks!  Bottom line? I can't believe you're still reading this instead of heading to Allwyn's!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are visiting Toronto for the weekend and we're looking for a Caribbean restaurant to pick up some Jamaican food, and this was not authentic Jamaican. Unsure as to why this place has received such great reviews, the jerk\"sauce\" was more like soy sauce and the chicken was not grilled, I don't even want to get started on what appeared to be the Uncle Ben boxed rice. The beef patties and cocoa bread were just bad bad bad. If you think this is authentic Jamaican food , you are extremely misinformed. Come to Chicago for some great Jamaican jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend to come here who grew up in the neighbourhood. Amazing food at a very budget price. Just grab a pound of chicken and go in. Put some srirachi and get it with coleslaw.  Best $10 I've spent on food in Toronto. This is a grab and go spot, so most likely would suggest taking it to go."}
{"text":"This is probably the best jerk chicken in Toronto. I finished the entire sandwich before I could take a breath (Jerk chicken sandwich with coleslaw in it on coco bread) and then decided to split a beef patty sandwich even though I was already too full ... The prices are extremely cheap but the quantity and quality is all there. The decor is lacking but hey ..I'm satisfied   10/10."}
{"text":"Had the curry chicken with rice and peas and it was soooo bland. Worst curry chicken I've ever had. Also tried the stuffed sandwich, which was pretty decent."}
{"text":"FYI this is a cash only take out restaurant so be prepared. We had curry goat and jerk chicken. Both came with rice and peas and coleslaw. We also had the beef patty and cocobread. The curry goat lacked flavor and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The jerk chicken had more flavor than the goat but is nothing special. The patties were stale and should be called something else. There are definitely better options for Jamaican/Caribbean food in the vicinity. I'm not sure how all these great reviews came about. Were these reviewers paid off or something?  Maybe they're not accustomed to our (Jamaican) food. Whatever the case may be I don't see myself coming back unless I get a cut of this reviewer money or it's an absolute emergency."}
{"text":"This place JUST opened up so I would expect for them to put in just a bit extra effort. Instead it's the opposite. Came in at 7:15 knowing that they close at 8pm. I drive just to get jerk chicken but instead he was playing on his phone with the cage down at 7:15?! I asked what's up? And he said sorry man I have to go somewhere today. Closed almost an hour early?! Young guy, obviously isn't serious about his business. Complete definition of unprofessionalism. Was super happy a jerk spot opened in north york but will never return here. Goodbye! Also THEY WERE BUSTED FOR FOUR MAJOR INFRACTIONS!! NOT CLEAN!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! This place has the best jerk chicken I have ever tasted. Combine that wit that crazy soft co co bread and oh my god. orgasmic. lol you have to try this place if you're visiting Toronto"}
{"text":"Came here as soon as i found it on yelp! I have to say it is not so great as people say. The owner is a funny and friendly man. I came here at about 3pm and ordered the legendary jerk chicken sandwich, but guess what? Out of chicken! Of course i could order somethings else but i wasn't  in a hurry and i came for that particular sandwich so i waited for 20 mins. The sandwich was good, really tasty if you add some chilli sauce. The chicken was soft and delicious, even the smell was nice. I will try this place some more times as it is located on my way home from school and the price is acceptable."}
{"text":"Agree with karen k., the jerk with slaw on cocobread is Fantastic!  A little tough to find it, tucked away in the alley, but totally worth it.  What a find.  Also, the Jamaican beef patties (spicy) are very good."}
{"text":"Environment - Love the homey vibe that this place gives off.  Not a place meant for eating in but there is a table and a side table.  I usually grab take out or a simple Jerk chicken on coco bread and eat it in the sun outside.  Service - great friendly staff that works very efficiently.  Line ups are sometimes inevitable because of the great food they serve.  Food - absolutely delicious.  My go to is jerk chicken with rice and peas or jerk chicken on coco bread.  They have jerk chicken wings that are only available on weekends and special (random) days.  If you like it spicy, ask for a little of their home made hot sauce instead of the siracha bottle they have on the front.  Pricing - great pricing for takeout food. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Just had Allwyns for the first time. I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich and felt it had very little flavor and the coleslaw was bland.  Also ordered a half order of jerk pork and was not impressed. The meat was fresh, but limited flavor."}
{"text":"Order the jerk chicken with rice and peas. It's spicy enough and the chicken is not dry.   This restaurant is at the corner of a old looking strip plaza with blue and white signage. Definitely adding this place to my hidden gem list!"}
{"text":"I visited based on a recommendation of a friend, ordered the 1/2 lb jerk chicken.  The service was great, quick and friendly.  Clearly a popular place, the place filled up quickly so you know the food is fresh given the turnover.  The chicken was meh, it reminded me of the chicken you get at a shopping mall food court (bourbon chicken, or fast food Chinese chicken) lots of joints, pieces of fat and small bones... often having to discard pieces.  It lacked the spice I expected, it was like chicken with a few shakes of pepper.... cash only"}
{"text":"Wonderful long time Jamaican restaurant.   Had jerk chicken which was great. Very happy with the food, service and price."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and ditto to what everyone else said. Love these little hole in the wall joints with no advertising, no large billboard...you know the food has to be good enough for them to survive through just word of mouth. I feel like all the other customers I see here share a look with me like, \"oh...so you know about my secret spot?\""}
{"text":"The jerk chicken sandwich is delicious and ~$5 (pretty good). It's ready in a couple of minutes and the cashier is always nice!"}
{"text":"We were visiting our daughter in the area and thought we try the jerk pork, chicken and curry chicken.  Jerk pork was spicy, but that was a given.  Jerk chicken had a good taste and very tender.  A big fan of rice and beans and add some oxtail gravy, you won't be disappointed. Good service and quick.  Definitely come back when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The sign on parkwoods plaza doesn't say Allwyn's bakery but it is still there. It is hidden in the alley near the dollar store. I went there last night and picked up a spicy beef patty with cocobread and a jerk chicken with slaw sandwich on cocobread. Both items came out to about 5 dollars so definitely a good buy!! the chicken was very juicy and hot (temperature), which made the sandwich that much better. I will definitely recommend this place to others and will be going back often since it is fairly close to me."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a quick bite before my friend's bachelor party at North Beach Volleyball, lo and behold a very quick hunger solution tucked in the corner of a plaza!  Restaurant size: Along the outer wall and window there is bar seating, and a couple tables and chairs in the middle. Not necessarily a place you sit down and eat at, but if you needed to you probably could. There does not seem to be a washroom available for patrons, but the grocery store next door does!  Food quality: I ordered a jerk chicken coco bread sandwich w/ coleslaw and was surprised at its size -- it's a little small, so if you're ravenous you may need to order 2, or throw in some beef patties (I chose this option on my adventure!). Don't let the size deter you: this sandwich will make your tastebuds dance and sing. Great spice, nice soft, semi-sweet bread, and creamy (but not too much so!) coleslaw.   I wasn't sure if I'd be able to stomach a spicy patty, so I opted for a mild...which didn't really have any hint of spice at all. And that was totally fine, as you could experience the flaky pastry shell.  All in all: good time.  Service: FAST.  Final thoughts: A great place to swing by and quickly grab some nice eats!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this location, conveniently located close to home. Excellent curry chicken roti, with large portions."}
{"text":"I love across the street from this place and I can hands down say best jerk chicken ever!!! If you haven't tried them you are definitely missing out on excellent food!"}
{"text":"Best place for jerk chicken. I love their jerk sandwich with coleslaw. Super inexpensive and the meat is so damn soft. You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"It's very good I got chicken jerky combo with rice. Not so expensive and very tasty. The place is inside a mall soupy have to go in behind Tim hortons or lcbo. There seating area is same as food court nothing fancy but the food is cheap and tasty. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It does the trick if you'd like some Jamaican food, however this is kind of like going to Tim Hortons if you have a craving for Canadian Cuisine. Does the trick but if you go a little further out there is more authentic tasting food out there. Fresh enough, but could do with more flavour and more generous portions which can be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it seems like a lot of the attention went towards the new Yonge and Sheppard location and they've left this location to other people.   Went to get some jerk chicken sandwiches and a jerk chicken with rice and peas but was told that there was no jerk chicken.  This at the height of the dinner rush."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally tried this place.  This is some of the best jerk chicken I've ever had and it's extremely affordable.  I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here for the famous jerk sandwich that Yelpers raved about. Although its on the small side for $5.25, it was tasty and the perfect snack. I wish I could have added their homemade hot sauce which the lady told me about after. Its made with scotch bonnet peppers. Many people were walking in getting take out, I was the only one who sat and ate (lunch break).   I will try the jerk dinner next time. This place seems to be sponsored by Yelp. The lady told me ever since Yelpers raved about the sandwich, business sky rocketed. There are huge Posters of actual Yelp reviews all over the store front windows and inside on the walls along with Bob Marley posters. Hidden gem.   Update: the staff here are so kind and friendly. some cool ladies behind the counter here"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the exterior/shopping area (with all the vacant shops etc).. Jerk sandwich is amazingly tasty and well priced. No card just cash but the TD atm is still there although the bank is gone."}
{"text":"I tried the jerk sandwich and it was absolutely tasty. Quite spicy but still has many smokey flavours. Service was fast and polite. Low cost makes it more than worth it. I can't wait to go back and try something else. The location which is inside a mall directly connected to Shepard Yonge station also makes it quite convenient"}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken and coleslaw in cocoa bread. Oxtail is fall off the bone which is great but it severely lacks flavor. Will only visit for jerk chicken and coleslaw sandwiches, that's all I would recommend food wise. Coming from a man from the Caribbean."}
{"text":"I went to Allwyn's twice today. Once to buy a jerk chicken sandwich and a half dozen spicy patties, and then a second time to buy another half dozen patties because I finished all of the first six already.  The owner is super friendly and chats everyone up, and the clientele doesn't scare me into locking my car doors like some of the other...how do I put this...ethnic restaurants on/around Victoria Park Ave.  Bottom line: the food was really yummy and really cheap."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a work day. My friends and I got jerk chicken and we are now frequent customers. Chicken is moist and it has just the right amount of spice to blend well with the rice and peas. Coleslaw was perfect to cool off my tongue as I inhaled the spicy rice. If you don't like coleslaw, you can get plantains instead.  Patty + coco bread was alright. I think I'll just get the patty next time if I wanted a snack."}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing. The chicken or pork sandwiches melt in your mouth. The bun with coleslaw with meat is a delicious combo. The dinners are rock solid, too. Value and taste-wise, this place could not be beat in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not a lot of space to eat in. There is a stand up counter on one side of the restaurant that protrudes out of the way. Then there is a modest round table that will accommodate four chairs.  A local brought me because I was craving oxtail stew with rice and peas.  My meal was delicious.  A small styrofoam container was packed full with rice, lots of oxtail pieces and coleslaw.  This was a slurp and smile kind of meal.  Service was efficient and the people who run this establishment are lovely.  The most popular order seemed to be the jerk chicken sandwich which indeed looked fantastic.  Will definitely be back but be warned, this is definitely off the beaten track and more of a neighbourhood spot than a destination eating place.  Lots of regulars came in--mostly tradespeople, couriers, and residents of the Underhill neighbourhood.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The best jerk chicken sandwich! I love this place! It looks run down but the food is worth it. The price is cheap as well. I live downtown but when I get the chance I will mission for this place."}
{"text":"I had previously written a very good review for this business and still stand by my opinion on their food but to be fair to my fellow yelpers I feel I need to add a new one.   The hours posted here and on the door indicate that they are open until 10 every night,  but one more than one occasion have been turned away (once at 9:15) saying that there was no more of anything other than patties.   The first time we accepted it and that was that... Now that it is happening multiple times it is obvious they had simply decided to pack everything up early so they could leave.  We called afterwards and we're basically told that they don't care that customers are being turned away.  To my way of thinking if you post hours then you are serving food for those hours,  not that the employees can cut off service at any time in order to get out right at \"closing time\".   If you go in the afternoon I would say it is worth it,  but if you are going later,  don't bother or at least call first to ensure they haven't closed early."}
{"text":"We are lucky enough to live nearby to their new location on Underhill Dr.  We had seen it for a few weeks and finally walked in last Tuesday.  Even though they were about to close, they were super friendly and patient with us as we studied the menu and tried to decide :)  We settled on the Jerk Chicken dinner with ox-tail gravy.  One word...AMAZING!.  The chicken was not too spicy and super moist, while the rice and peas had great flavour, and OMG the home made coleslaw!  It was so good we went back Saturday night and even got an extra side of the coleslaw. :)  If you live in the area (and even if you don't) do yourself a favour and grab something from here...you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Went here after reading rave reviews on Yelp. The food was okay but didn't quite match the hype at all. It is a small take-out joint. The price is low. But the taste isn't great either, nor is the quality. It was just okay.  Would recommend you to go there if you want a cheap meal. Don't go there with the expectation of finding a tasty meal that you'll remember fondly."}
{"text":"This was a delightful little patty joint,  the exterior is quite small and that's how you know the food gone be fire they don't even take care of the outside like they put in all the time and effort into this food and it is worth it. We found like of tail bones outside the restaurant it was that good and on our walk there was some coleslaw in the street two minutes away and a rapper from the store. Someone was walking home and finish their meal in two minutes that's impressive I recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken Dinner rocks, and that Jerk Chicken Sandwich with the Coleslaw on it is delicious. Add some spicy sauce and your mouth will water. Great place to grab a bite.  This neighbourhood is actually fortunate to have Alwyns.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"The Jerk chicken they have is tasty and the curry goat as well. The coleslaw salad is also a must try."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken sandwich was really tasty.  But there was a little more fat in the meat then I would have liked, and there was one bite where I had a joint bone, wasn't too impressed with that.  But the flavor of the chicken is amazing! No question about it. It still gets 4 stars because the taste is something i'll definitely come back for."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I'd have to say it was pretty good.  I had the stuffed sandwich and the curry goat and I was satisfied. The stuffed sandwich was amazing! I had it with the spicy beef patty and boy was it delicious. The curry goat wasn't anything special but hit the spot. All in all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been getting my haircut at Parkwoods Men's Hairstyling my entire life (30 years) and have never bothered to step foot in Allwyn's, until this evening.  I read some reviews on this place, last year, and have been meaning to pay it a visit for quite a while; and I'm glad that I did.  The jerk chicken sandwich and beef patties lived up to the hype.  I will definitely be going back for more in the near future.  I wish I had come sooner.  To the owner, get some WD40 for your door; it screeches higher than Robert Plant's voice."}
{"text":"absolute perfection! the jerk chicken sandwich was simple yet packed with flavour. I also had the oxtail with rice and peas and it was also very delicious! be sure to try out their homemade hot sauce"}
{"text":"The Stuffed Sandwich is amazing! Only place that has a beef patty, coleslaw, jerk chicken, coco bread combo for just over $5. Their portions are fairly large and even a small at $7 is a pretty satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Not Authentic Caribbean Jerk/Food!  I ordered jerk chicken and rice and pea; I had some and throwout the rest, its was horrible.  The chicken was dry, too charred, & no taste of jerk whatsoever.  Rice and peas had a weird taste and musty smell, whatever herbs they put in the rice didn't do it justice, and the rice had no peas."}
{"text":"A really great, no frills joint, that specializes in not very traditional, and not very spicy, BONELESS jerk chicken, and jerk pork sandwiches.  The stuffed sandwich which is the Jamaican version of a \"turducken\", with boneless jerk chicken - stuffed inside a spicy beef patty - stuffed inside Coco bread - with some coleslaw for crunch and flavor, is a real treat.  It's takeout only, very bare bones, and $9.95 for a tiny order of oxtail the size of a Big Mac container is a bit over-the-top, but the spicy beef patties are great, I love the boneless jerk chicken, and that sandwich is a real treat!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem....literally hidden.   Oxtail dinner and stuffed sandwich are to die for!   Just remember that it's cash only and this place is a one man operation so be pairing when there's a line up!   Going back to try the roti!"}

{"text":"heard about this place a month ago from BlogTo.i live in the area and it was on ubereats ,so we decided to take a trip down the street at around 7:50pm.Surprisingly when we ordered they had everything on the menu.we ordered the jerk chicken oxtail,jerk wings and the stuffed chicken sandwich.I was impressed with everything we ordered.Im excited for them to introduce soups to the menu.I will definitely be going back.It opened just in time for the summer time!"}
{"text":"I had a small jerk chicken with rice and bean. Jerk chicken was good, not the best.  Would have been nice if they include couple of slices of plantain... I also had beef patty with a coco bun that was yummy .  I will come back"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out this place because it's nearby with pretty good reviews.  For lunch, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($4.40) and Spicy Beef Patty ($1.50). Yes, I eat quite a lot and $6 got me really full. I agree with other reviews that you get your money's worth. I was first asked to pay double and a little sorry would've been nice after I pointed it out. It's not really a dine-in location (though there are seats) so be ready to eat it somewhere else.   I've never tried a jerk chicken sandwich before, but I wasn't too crazy about it. It tastes good, but the coleslaw was so rich with mayo that it was too heavy in my opinion. There's no acidity to the slaw at all that that it doesn't cut through the creaminess of the mayo. I wish it was a bit more balanced! The chicken itself was seasoned nicely.  The spicy beef patty has a kick to it and is really cheap for $1.50!"}
{"text":"Wow! Best jerk chicken I've ever had. The gentleman that served me was so friendly and happy. Seasoning was perfect, skin was crisp, chicken tender and juicy and the best part was that is was fresh out the oven! I also had a coco Patty sandwich - awesome! I'm glad this place is in my neighborhood. The only shame is that there are only 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Jerk chicken and pork place I've tried. And what's even as pleasing, it's the price. Food is dirt cheap, and it tastes awesome. The spicy beef patties are simply delicious. Seems like he makes them on the spot, and not those frozen most places own. I've tried the jerk chicken and jerk pork and they was extremely good. I usually get a small pork, small chicken, two patties, and a coleslaw to share between two people. Comes to under 20$ for everything. The portions are huge, a large one can feed an elephant. I lived in that area for 8 years and have never tried it. Now I find myself travelling quite a distance to pickup a nice lunch or dinner from here. The place looks run down, cash only, but don't be intimidated, try it!"}
{"text":"Agree with most of the other yelpers. The jerk chicken sandwich with coleslaw is really good, and it doesn't taste too heavy and comes to $3.95 tax incld. Great quick lunch place if you don't mind picking it up and go!"}
{"text":"read a review from blog.to that's what lead me  to visit Allwyn's  it was a let down   their patty was too dry, less filling than allan's pastry  small serving  lacked jerk flavour..   the carribean jerk in the mall was better tasting and cheaper compared to what I got at Allwyns for 7 bucks-small chicken jerk with rice and peas  sorry I am not returning back"}
{"text":"Definately a hidden gem.  I work in the area ans pop in here time to time for lunch.  Was here last friday and as usual i was not disappointed.   Had myself a small jerk chicken on rice and peas and a jerk pork on a bun.  Ny usual go to is the jerk chicken sandwich which is always moist and flavourful.   My jerk chicken was very tasty.    Prices are good and there are specials.  I think fridays are half and dull pound wing specials.   I will continue to come here.  Talking to friends a lot of them have heard of the place, so i guess the word has been getting out.  If you ever in the area worth a try.    There are a few tables but this is definately more of a take out spot."}
{"text":"The bomb diggity of jerk chicken. They just moved right by my house so this could become a problem for me! Delicious and juicy chicken full of flavour, the coco bread is fresh and has a hint of sweetness which balances the spicy chicken and creamy coleslaw perfectly. Check this one out!"}
{"text":"I agree with most of the reviewers that this place looks kind of shady and quite frankly creepy, but you only come here for one thing when your'e at Parkwood Plaza.  You come here for Allwyn's Bakery.  I love their spicy beef patties.  The pastry is a bit thicker but still flaky compared to other beef patty joints in the city.    It's a great value $7 gets you half a dozen and for $3.65 you can try their famous mouth watering, soft fluffy cocobread, slightly crisped jerk chicken and cruchy slaw sandwich.   These sandwiches are addictive, after having just one, I lust for another, but had to hold back and control my urge."}
{"text":"My go to spot for JERK!! This is the only spot I'll go to!! The best jerk chicken in Toronto! The best part is that it's only 4 mins away from my work! LOLOLOLOL   The serving is BIG!! U'll need a bed after eating their jerk chicken!! It's sooo good!!   They only accept CASH but then again there's a TD bank next door!   Staff is good & pretty straight forward!"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot for a fast, delicious, and filling meal. We had the oxtail with rice, beef patties, and their jerk chicken sandwich.   The oxtail is so good, super tender and tasty. The jerk chicken isn't dry at all and you can't go wrong with the beef patties. We actually ordered them as dessert to eat on the way back to the office.   It's predominantly a take out place but they do have one table and a little high top where you could stand and eat. I think if I'm not mistaken it's Cash only as well. This place isn't about the decor or aesthetics but the food is the main attraction and I'm here for it"}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken, Cocobread, and Coleslaw is an odd combination, but SOOOO good. Please support this local business. Your taste buds and wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"Ordered the large jerk chicken with rice and peas for my boyfriend and I. The meal Came with coleslaw, boneless meat, more rice than you could imagine and I also bought 2 beef patties. Handsdown the beat jerk chicken meal I've had in a very long time! Spicy but not to spicy for me, and the boyfriend got it spicy! He loved it too!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Made with love. Exceptional food and staff. You need to come here.  The quality of their food is some of the best I've tasted. They have a good variety in their menu. Generous portion and decent prices. Can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"I just ordered through Uber Eats. I ordered the jerk chicken with rice and veggies and a spice patty on the side. WOW the food is amazing. The chicken is so flavourful, tender and juicy. A definite must order! The patty was good too. The pastry wasn't greasy or dry and there was quite a bit of filling inside.   Definitely coming back to try something else like the Ox Tail!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the past 2 years- religiously!   The jerk chicken sandwich is super tasty! The chicken is nice and juicy and the flavour is there. The one con is I find the spice is lacking. But, still an addicting sandwich nonetheless. Their coco bread is super delish' as well! I am always leaving with a dozen of cocoa breads and the spicy patties!"}
{"text":"I saw an ad for this place on Facebook.  They showed how they made their Jerk Chicken on Coco bread.  The sandwich was amazing.  Very tasty.  One thing thought: Bring cash.  No debit or credit cards accepted here.   The beef patties were standard fare and nothing to scream about.  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"I would always recommend Allwyn's over Jerk King, both of which are located in the Emerald Park building until today. The jerk chicken had always been good and I really liked the soft coconut bread and coleslaw they used for their sandwiches. No wonder there is usually a huge lineup at lunchtime on weekdays.  However the food today was a letdown. The chicken we got today was hard to chew and did not taste as good as before - my partner did not finish his chicken because of that. Also, the chicken left a weird taste in my mouth, which still lingered when I got home. Hope they keep their food quality consistent next time."}
{"text":"I went to high school in this area and it took me over 10 years to find out about Allwyn's and check it out.   I had to renew my license at the Drive Test Centre at Victoria Park & Lawrence so I decided to stop by Allwyn's to help me endure the long wait. I went on a weekday shortly after they opened at 11:30 and joined the queue of construction workers who seemed to be regulars. I ordered the Stuffed Sandwich ($4.95) and a beef patty ($1.50).   The Stuffed Sandwich is described as \"patty and coco bread with jerk chicken.\" On paper, this might sound a bit much and something that you might find at the CNE, but it was actually a reasonable portion. The coco bread and patty was lightly toasted and the beef patty and jerk chicken added just the right amount of heat. The coleslaw was sweet and crunchy, and provided a nice balance. I should've followed suit and ordered extra meat (which the construction workers did) because it could've used more jerk chicken given the ratio of bread to meat.   The beef patty also could've used more filling; I would say the ratio of bread to meat was about 3-to-1. While good and actually spicy, it doesn't compare to other spicy beef patties I've had.   Overall, a filling and satisfying lunch. I wish I knew about this place during my high school years as an alternative to the school cafeteria. While this place is kinda hidden, it does seem to have quite a bit of a following judging from the queue right when they opened and the swarm of high school and elementary school students the arrived shortly after I left."}
{"text":"The beef patty was great but everything else was mediocre. We got ox tail and jerk chicken and found many slithers of styrofoam in the rice."}
{"text":"The epitome of the HOLE IN THE WALL.  Nestled in Parkwoods Plaza - between VP and Ellesmere and York Mills and DVP, this little bakery is amazing.  You walk in - it's dirty and small (10 feet by 10 feet) they have a handful of hard dough bread on the side but that's not why people come here.  Believe me they do.  If you stand outside the store for 10 minutes you will notice people walking consistently (a person a minute) and coming out with a styrofoam container (jerk chicken, pork or stew) or paper bags (Jamaican patties, or Jerk Chicken on a bun).  I can't stress how good this place is.  Jerk Chicken on Coco bread with cole slaw if you just want a taste.  $4.  If you're ready to dive full in, what I love is the Jerk Chicken with coleslaw on a bed of rice.  Make sure you get gravy on the rice or the rice will taste a little bland in comparison to the chicken. $8.  Wash it down with a Grace drink like cream soda.  The spice of the chicken, the creaminess of the coleslaw and the sweetness of the bread.  Great combo.  May this place be there forever.  Local legend!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is sooooooo good!!! Despite having never heard of this place until a couple of weeks ago, this is definitely my new favourite jerk take-out.   We ordered a ton of food because we had a hard time deciding what to get. We ordered half a dozen spicy beef patties, a large jerk chicken dinner, a large jerk pork dinner, and half a pound of jerk wings. The jerk wings were SO good that they kind of ruined the jerk chicken dinner for us. I wouldn't get the jerk chicken again, just because the wings were so much more flavourful. The jerk pork dinner was amazing; coleslaw was a good compliment to the spice and the rice and peas were delicious. The spicy patties are amazing as well; they don't dumb down the \"spicy\".  Next time, I'd like to try either the goat curry or the oxtail - they both look amazing!   In addition to everything being super yummy, we only spent a bit over $30 for all that food... How can you beat that?!?"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken in a coco bun is SOOOOO GOOD!!!! Worth the drive from Mississauga to have 1....or 2!! Patty I was not fond of....too much dough but the Jerk Chicken cancels out all bads!! Very busy and there is a reason why!"}
{"text":"This place is only about 4 mins drive from my work, and whenever I have serious beef patty cravings, this is the place to go. The prices are cheap and the serving is big.  There is basically only one table table to sit on, that can sit 4 people, but I don't think that matters, as this is really a take-out place.  Most of the cashiers/servers are just ok, the service is pretty straightforward.  I like the consistency of their patties, meaty and flavorful. One of the best beef patties in the GTA! If I am craving Jamaican food, this is my go-to place.  This place only accepts cash."}
{"text":"The only place I'll eat a jerk chicken sandwich with coleslaw in Toronto! I'm addicted."}
{"text":"The other dishes aside from the stuffed patty is kinda over priced for the portion but the service is fast and the stuffed patty is unique and pretty delicious. Oxtail was average."}
{"text":"Been going here since they first opened their doors while I was attending highschool in the neighborhood- delicious jerk chicken w/coco bread- I always got it with the slaw! Heard they are finally moving to a bigger location in the same mall- perhaps some new items on the menu too??!"}
{"text":"These are the best sandwich in the whole Toronto area.  The Guy that runs it is super charming and serves each client with great pleasure.  Last time I was there, he was about to move to a new location and people in the restaurant were scarded that they would never see him again !  He is quite popular for it's sandwichs in his neiborhood.  I will go back to this place fore ever... It is REALLY good."}
{"text":"This is an updated review at the new location. First off, it has a lot more room, is much cleaner, and for the first time ever, Allwyn's has seating!  ($$$ as of January 2016. All prices include taxes.)  Right off the bat I want to say that their prices have gone up a lot. Too much. The large jerk chicken dinner was $7.25 around the time his old location was closing down, and at the new one, the prices have gone up steadily every 3 or 4 months. Now that same dinner is $9.65 -- and that's insane. Seriously, I'm already going less because the value has gotten atrocious.  JAMAICAN PATTY SANDWICH (WITH COCO BREAD AND COLESLAW): ($2.50, or $2.25 without coleslaw)  This one hasn't gone up in price much at least. It's yummy, and two for $5 is filling and worth it. Without the slaw? Blah. I don't understand why people would do that. Without it, it's bland and boring -- it's Allwyn's delicious coleslaw that sets it apart. The coco bread and slaw -- one so soft and with a hint of coconut milk, the other a fantastic creamy crunch with lots of flavour. Available in both spicy and mild beef. Both are very good options, depending on your preference! I prefer mild. They used to only have the alternative patties (like chicken or veggie) sparingly on weekends, but now it seems to be available daily.  JERK CHICKEN SANDWICH WITH COLESLAW: ($4.60, also available with jerk pork for same price)  This thing is popular with the Yelp community. It's good but to me not filling for the price. I'd need to get 2 to be truly satisfied, and you're talking $9.20 by that point. There is a decent amount of boneless juicy chicken in that same soft coco bread with the slaw, but I certainly am not as impressed as others. Firstly, it's messy as heck (the chicken and slaw fall out of the bun, into the bag) and secondly, it's gone up in price FIVE times since I started going there not even that long ago. It used to be $3.70 and that I think was the right price for it. Then $3.85... then $4.25... then $4.40... and now $4.60. You can even see it in the pictures posted here -- every few months, higher prices. It's too much a jump, too often.  LARGE JERK CHICKEN DINNER: ($9.65, or $6.75 for the small)  Okay, first off, the jerk chicken on its own? Delicious. Allwyn's has some of the best jerk chicken around. The rice with beans? Plentiful and tasty, especially when it soaks in the jerk sauce. The slaw? Always good. It's filling, true, but the value is crap. As I said, it used to be $7.25 and now and not even that much later, it's almost 10 bucks.  JERK CHICKEN CURRY ROTI ($8.75, or $9.50 if you select goat)  A newer entry. The same boneless jerk chicken with potatoes, curry sauce, and wrapped in warm roti breading. It was good, although personally I didn't like the type of wrap they use. It was fairly dry, made using cornmeal or something. Next time, I will request extra sauce to compensate. When it launched at $7.25, it was decent value... now that's like $9. Come on.   Notes:  - You can get the jerk chicken or pork on its own. $5.90 for 1/2 a pound and $11 for 1 pound.  - The coleslaw can be purchased on its own as well ($2.50 / $3.95)  - They have soup on the weekend. I tried the oxtail soup once and did not like it  - They no longer serve loafs of bread at the new location  Overall: I like Allwyns and I am glad they were able to relocate rather than shut down, but their prices are lousy now, and will only continue to go up. There are a few other places I go to that have had the same prices since 2013 - they'll be getting my business more often.  (Also, don't blame the poor state of the dollar. You KNOW that if the economy improves, no business in the country will drop their prices back down. So basically, people are spending more without getting more)"}
{"text":"NOTE: AS OF JULY 1st, 2014, ALLWYN'S HAS MOVED!  New location: 81 Underhill Drive (Donwood Plaza), right next to Valu-Mart  The new location has a lot more room, looks cleaner, and has seating! No more line-ups of people cramming out the door like at the old location.  According to one of the employees, the new location no longer sells fresh baked bread loafs. I don't know if this is permanent or not. That is just what I was told.  Anyway, on to my review.  * * *  Allwyn's is great! I've been going there for a while and it's quite delicious and affordable. Also, all of their prices already include tax which is convenient.  JAMAICAN BEEF PATTY ON COCOBREAD WITH COLESLAW: ($2.50 as of July 2014)  The first time I got this because my friend always grabs it. It's very good. I like the coco bread and slaw a lot -- one so soft and with a hint of coconut milk, the other a fantastic crunch with lots of flavour. It's pretty creamy coleslaw, so probably has quite a bit of mayo, but it's great. Even though it's gone up in price a bit now and then, it's still a great value -- you can get it without the slaw if you prefer, but I personally think the slaw is the best part. I've gotten it both 'spicy' and 'mild'. Both are very good options.  JERK CHICKEN SANDWICH WITH COLESLAW: ($4.20 as of July 2014)  The next time I went (only 2 days later), I got this sandwich which is popular with the Yelp community. It's okay. There was a decent amount of boneless juicy chicken in that same soft coco bread, with crunchy slaw rounding it out - but I certainly wasn't as impressed as others. It's not THAT good, it's messy as heck (the chicken and slaw fall out into the bag), and it's gone up in price twice since I started going there. Getting two of the beef patties on a bun is better value than one chicken sandwich, but it's your call. I just don't find this worth it.  LARGE JERK CHICKEN DINNER: ($9 as of July 2014)  I got the large dinner once, and while it was very tasty, the price was too steep for my liking. For what you get, I think $7.50 is more reasonable, but that's just me  Note: On the weekends, they sometimes have two other varieties of patties: chicken and veggie. Both are really good. I recommend them if you want something other than the \"traditional\" beef patties.  Overall: I will continue going back! Donald is friendly (it's just him there most of the time) and I'm glad that with the renovations at the old plaza, Allwyn's was able to relocate to a great new spot!"}
{"text":"3.5  My brother came today at lunch, and he brought me home food immediately after. Food was still fresh when I got it. Good stuff. Had a jerk chicken sandwich and two jerk wings. I wouldn't get the wings again. They were on the dry side, and not particularly outstanding. However, I would definitely get the jerk chicken sandwich again. At $4.75 including tax, this was quite the sandwich. This thing is the size of three or four patties stacked on top of each other. The bread was not particularly impressive, but I prefer my bread toasted, so fluffy doesn't quite cut it for me. However, there was an impressive amount of juicy jerk chicken inside, and the coleslaw definitely did cut into some of that jerk intensity. Good stuff. There was a bit of cartilage in my sandwich, but I can deal with that. A cheap eat, that sandwich is."}
{"text":"I finally tried the jerk chicken curry roti...WOW!!!!!  There us a reason why they have won 2 years best jerk chicken on blog TO!! Damn great!!  Just remember, they only take cash."}
{"text":"Great sandwich but consistency of the meat has been questionable. The price of the food here is excellent. I'll be going here a few more times and will update my review if the meat stays as good as the first time J went."}
{"text":"Been going to this little gem for years whenever I'm in the east end. They have the best Jamaican patties and jerk chicken sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Best Jerk wings in TO! The jerk pork is pretty amazing as well. Prices are as good or better than most places."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and read all the reviews. Jerk chicken is one of my favourite foods so I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich. I admit the  coco bread was fresh, the slaw was a nice addition, however the chicken could be spicier."}
{"text":"This location has MOVED to 81 Underhill Drive (same plaza as the Value Mart).  This is the place to go if you want cheap delicious food! I always get the jerk chicken on a coco bun with a spicy beef patty on the side. The coco bun is always soft and tastes fresh and the jerk chicken is flavourful. It comes with coleslaw inside the sandwich as well, which adds some nice crunch. The spicy beef patty doesn't taste spicy at first but the spice will creep up on you the more you eat! So make sure you have some water or juice on hand to wash the spice down. Both those items cost me about $5!! There are also rice options as well if you're feeling like you need a bit more sustenance.   Parking can easily be found in the lot outside. There is now seating (yay!) although its just one table with 5-6 chairs, it's better than nothing, especially if you want to eat your jerk chicken sandwich hot! Service is always friendly.. even friendlier if you're a pretty girl lol. Lastly, expect to see a line up if you're coming for the lunch rush. Thankfully it's very fast!"}
{"text":"Got their spicy patty .. could not finish it was so salty .. it was more patty than filling .. so sad they used to be ok when they were at Parkwood plaza"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after so many positive reviews. I had the small jerk chicken which came with the standard rice and peas and coleslaw.  Portion was good. Jerk was slightly spiced and mostly meat. Personally I found the meal, with the absence of skin and bone, to be on the bland side.  Overall an average jerk.   Establishment clean, service friendly, prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't know why \"Bakery\" keeps coming up, but at 4750 Yonge Street, #135 is ALLWYN'S The Best Jerk.  We have gone there a few times and the jerk chicken was always fresh, hot and tender.  However when we went there on 21 April 2018 around 13:30, the food court was quite packed.  I ordered the 1/4 lb jerk chicken but the chicken was over cooked and dried out.  We will think twice about going there again."}
{"text":"I had my eye on this place for some time and happen to be in the area this weekend. Yay! We tried the oxtail, curry chicken roti, goat soup, spicey beef patty and the jerk chicken sandwich. The highlight is most definitely the jerk chicken sandwich - the jerk chicken was juicy, savory and super flavorful add to that crunchy coleslaw in a coco bun......YUMMY. I'd trek to eat that again, it was really good! I'd pass on everything else as I've had much better elsewhere. Staff were very friendly and helpful too:)"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good.  The raves about the Jerk Chicken Sandwich with Cole Slaw are well deserved.  Coco bread is soft, warm and delicious.   Love the Patties too.  Never tried their other hot food items but they have a tremendous following for them.  I always see people ordering their wings too.  Limited seating available.  The best."}
{"text":"So good..... Hidden treasure for sure.... Jerk chicken isn't on the bone making it real easy to eat but is just as juicy as a thigh etc... Go there."}
{"text":"In a stripmall born in the 80's, right in the corner beside ValueMart, you'll find this hidden gem.  This is, by far, the best jerk in town.  I'm addicted to the jerk chicken sandwich on coco bread, loaded with creamy coleslaw.  The coleslaw gives it a nice crunch.  The jerk chicken wings hit the spot too.  Oxtail is next on my list.  Make sure you have cash.  No debit/credit.  I think the convenience store next door has an ATM."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Jerk chicken and the best jerk chicken sandwiches. Their food is always fresh and the staff is super friendly! Definitely worth a visit. They have moved from their York Mills location, I believe they are on Underhill now."}
{"text":"Fast service. Cash only. Taxes in prices. Good portions and not skimpy on the meat. This is my new spot. Sir allwyn, you've earned my loyalty."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this place for a quick lunch. The food is always incredible, and the price is even better. $15 in this place can go a long way! My favourite menu items here are the jerk pork and jerk chicken sandwiches. The coco-bread is always fresh, soft, and sweet. I also highly recommend the ox tail soup (only available on weekends)."}
{"text":"jerk chicken with cole slaw on cocobread.   it is fuckin delicious. no lie.   yeah the place is a little dark and grimy but there is no better spot. they recently got rid of their old grooved changeable letterboard menu, sad!!!!!  my brother moved to asia and pines for the jerk chicken sandwiches from allwyns!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here. Been trying to get here for a long time and was never convenient for me until this one time.  The jerk chicken dinner was delicious. Jerk chicken does not have bones, what a treat! And the flavor is intense and delicious.  The jerk pork is also good, but it just reminds me a bit of chinese BBQ pork, but instead of a sweet finish it's a jerk spicy finish.  The beef patty though is totally different. It was big, rectangular not the normal crescent shape. But first bite into it all I got was pastry. I want the beef. Those gotta be filled up more or smaller.  The service is quick, polite. Not overly friendly but not rude either, it's just business."}
{"text":"There is so much hype for this joint, but I finally see the reason behind it. Allwyn's has the best chicken sandwich in Toronto. End of story. For only $5 this sandwich can't be beat. Tender juicy chicken topped with creamy coleslaw encased within a pillowy Coco bread. Absolutely perfection."}
{"text":"The plaza its in makes you feel like you have gone back to the dark architectural days of the 1970 but this place is really awesome.  If you are on the fence, drop in and get a jerk chicken sandwich, it tastes great and the price is right."}
{"text":"PRO- Decent, fair prices.  A good addition to this area. NEG- Very salty, salty aftertaste.  Chicken was cold in the jerk chicken dinner.  Gravy/sauce not great. Makes sense if you live/work close by."}
{"text":"I found Allwyn's again!!! If you remember my previous post when they were back at VP and Ellesmere then you know I had to come check the new renovated spot. Internal decor much better. Their jerk chicken sandwich is STILL as amazing as I remember. And worth the drive!   Got the oxtail, bit of a disappointment. Flavors not all there, meat a bit too tough and charging $15 for it.   Don't be adventurous when you're there. Stick to the jerk chicken sandwich. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken and Coleslaw sandwich is just plain amazing.  The interior is absolutely dreadful; fried oil all over the walls. Supplies on the sides.  Service is a bit slow (but there's only one person there- strange I know)  Compared to Sunrise; By far Sunrise will win when it comes to rice and peas w/ oxtail/jerk chicken/curry goat. Presentation and taste for the meals is mediocre. HOWEVER; the Jerk chicken sandwich/ patty and coco bread gets 5 stars. Its definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Food here is great and cheap! The service is also great, they are so sweet and accommodating!  Ordered:  Jerk wings: delicious and spicy   Beef patty spicy: spicy and served hot  Jerk chicken coco bread sandwich: delicious with the crunchy coleslaw which cools down the spice factor   Paid roughly $12 for all of it"}
{"text":"Competition is closed people. Allwyn's takes the cake for best jerk chicken VALUE in Toronto. $4.50 for a jerk chicken sandwich on coco bread with slaw. $11 for a pound of jerk chicken or pork. $11 for a pound of jerk chicken wings (Weekends only). $1.50 for beef and chicken patties. Everything on the menu is home made, including the patties. Should be a crime to sell quality food for this cheap. Oh baby - you just found yourself a gem. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My worst experience. There was too much fat on the meat and the location is very bad. But the beef patties are good and I recommend to not stay there. Just get and leave. Also this place only takes cash."}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken and a beef patty.  The chicken was great.  Nice and tender.  The patty had too much crust though."}
{"text":"I had the jerk pork. I was very impressed. The pork tasted delicious perfectly cooked. The coleslaw was delicious too. I got a good amount of protein. I also had the beef patties. They were alright. It's the same patties from bathurst and warden station. It wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken, patties and coco bread. I've been going to this place since it opened over 20 yrs ago because it's just that good."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto this past week and stopped by the Yonge St location. Delish!!!! Must try...I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough.  The jerk chicken with coleslaw. Maybe get two - one for now, one for later. The owner gives a soup nazi-esque first impression but he's only pulling your jerk."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years, even before they moved. At first, my hubby and I were pretty bummed because their old location was literally right across from where we live. Oh well, it's the old plaza's loss. Favourites are jerk chicken with rice and oxtail with rice. A few months back I first tried their jerk wings and let me tell you. You need to try it. :) Good solid place that even though we have to drive to get there now, we will happily oblige every time we get a hankering for jerk!"}
{"text":"I came here during lunch break from work and it was great! Wish I found this place earlier. We had the jerk chicken with rice, the spice level was a bit much for me personally, but I still enjoyed the fantastic flavour. Service was slow during busy lunch hour, so 4 stars overall. The lady who cashed me out didn't know how to use the debit/credit card machine. The portion and price was good. Will come back again and try the jerk chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This place use to be in a plaza near York Mills and Vic Park, when I saw they were closing all the shops and it was blocked off I was devastated because I loved Allwyn's jerked chicken sandwiches. However when I discovered they relocated to Underhill, I was super excited and it taste the same as before, awesome. I definitely recommend this place for a quick bite, or grab a few lbs of jerked chicken for take out and pig out at home, it's soooo good."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken or  jerk pork Sandwich with coleslaw on coco bread equal fantastic"}
{"text":"I've been going to Allwyn's for over 15 years. The quality of the food has never let me down. My go-to is the Jerk Chicken sandwich with coleslaw. SO GOOD. And even though the prices have gone up, it's really only due to inflation. It's still a good price for a great snack sandwich.   The patties here are awesome too, the spicy is my favourite.   Kinda sucks they had to move location, but the new place is bigger and has a small area to sit in."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken on Coco bread I've ever had!  I grew up in the North York area and used to go to their original shop and was disappointed when it was temporally closed.  Now with this new location closed to my work, I would go there at least once or twice a week!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken sandwich in town. The location is in the middle of no where but those are the restaurants you have to look out for.   The chicken is always on point, very flavourful and the chicken is never dry."}
{"text":"I've tried the jerk chicken and jerk pork with rice and peas, but my fave is the stuffed sandwich! It contains jerk chicken and coleslaw, stuffed inside a spicy beef patty... and then sandwiched between soft coco bread! I feel like a fatass when I eat this, but it's sooooo yummy! It's very filling for $5 +tax. I haven't tried the original location, but a good jerk place was much needed in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a review on Yonge location.  Been there 3 times and each time it tasted different.  I had the jerk chicken roti and stuff jerk pork sandwich.  First time was too spicy.  Second time was the best.  Portion of meat was good and big chunky piece which i like.  The third was the worst.  Overly salty and portion was small."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this spot because of all the good reviews I had been hearing. Unfortunately I found the food to be under average for me. Firstly, what kind of beans are in the rice and peas?, never seen any bean like that before but okay. Was looking forward to the rice and peas that usually contain kidney beans. I had an oxtail dinner and jerk dinner. The oxtail was all bone and when I did get some of the meat it was tasteless. The jerk was just okay. I heard a lot about how good their coleslaw was so I was surprised to find it not that creamy and tasteless as well. I also ordered their chicken curry roti which was good and so was their jerk wings."}
{"text":"Wow!  So tasty!  Had the jerk chicken and pork.  It is spicy, moist, and just straight up amazing.  The jerk chicken is boneless which is nice.    Friendly staff.  This place is tucked away in a small plaza so it is definitely a hidden gem.  There is a small sitting area, but this is more of a take-out place.    I have to go back and try the ox-tail next time."}
{"text":"Just as amazing as the old location.  Jerk Chicken sandwich $4.25 - huge chunks of chicken, soft light coco bread and to top it off a fresh coleslaw. I haven't been here in a while so I had 3 just for myself in one sitting.  Also tried their oxtail rice and peas $11 - there was a nice portion of meat and it was tender and soft but it was really lacking in flavour. Even though I would give the oxtail a 3 star rating, the jerk chicken sandwich gets bonus points because I have yet to find a place that can make a jerk chicken sandwich like this place does it."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken Sandwich. Just go get some. And when I mean \"some\"  I mean I downed 3 of these right off the bat and saved another 2 for later. They are that good. Perfect amount of coleslaw and a healthy amount of jerk chicken in a nice coco-bun. Inside this place feels like a sauna in the summer. I don't know how that old Asian guy does it. He's a funny guy. Last time I ordered 10 jerk chicken sandwiches and he was like \"only 10\".  Cash only, take out only. No need for pictures for this review as they all look the same and I always forget anyway since I can't wait to eat them."}
{"text":"Note: I have updated this from four to five stars since I so desperately miss this place now that I don't work in Toronto! They have a one-of-a-kind jerk chicken sandwich everyone around North York should try.  ----  Delicious sandwich, super cheap, hilarious service. What more can you ask for for lunch. This little gem is the definition of \"hole in the wall.\"  My friends tried a variety of things. I myself had two jerk chicken sandwiches (totally stuffed - one will do). We agreed the jerk chicken sandwich is the best thing. Although the oxtail looks pretty good.  Check it out if you want some cheap, good eats."}
{"text":"Nothing said. I usually don't like jerk chicken and it's only good in moderate amounts... I would honestly say, the only jerk chicken I would eat is the coconut bun jerk chicken sandwich from here. May they never close down."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their coleslaw is the best I have ask for the chicken to be cut in small pieces for the jerk chicken sandwich and you will not be dissapointed"}
{"text":"This place rocks and is the true meaning of a hidden gem.  Like most other reviews suggest you've got to try the Jerk Chicken sandwich with coleslaw on Coco bread as well as their uniquely delicious Patties that doesnt cheap out on the filling like some places.  Excellent prices, great food - cant ask for more."}
{"text":"Great price and great food. Been here 3 times no complaints.  Unrivalled in my opinion on value for money and quality of food."}
{"text":"Probably the best jerk chicken I've ever had! I love that they serve coleslaw with the chicken over rice. It creates a great contrast of flavours and textures."}
{"text":"Was vacationing from NYC and heard about this place on social media. It was 6 mins away from my hotel which was great. I went to try the jerk chicken sandwich and chicken patties. Both were very underwhelming. The jerk chicken was very wet, fatty, and almost gummy. Very strange, with very little jerk flavor. The chicken patty had very little filling and the crust wasn't spectacular. Next time I'm in Canada I will def try a different Jamaican spot."}
{"text":"The best chicken curry dinner I've ever had. Huge portion, not overly spicy (you can add your own homemade green hot sauce), tender rice and peas and creamy coleslaw. I also enjoyed the oxtail soup. A giant serving for $3.99. Welcome to Yonge and Sheppard Allwyn's! You will be seeing us lots."}
{"text":"This rating is for the jerk chicken sandwich, which stole my heart. For $4.85 (tax not included), you get tender, juicy chicken and optional house coleslaw on a homemade coconut bun (we bought a few, and they keep the same way fresh bread goes bad, which is ~4 days).   According to a few close friends, they also have great customer service: My friends who live in the area and frequent this place had them cater a recent event. Allwyn's had given my friend an extra platter of jerk chicken instead of another smaller item. Instead of asking for my friend to drive to their store to make the switch, they made the trek to their place in the recent ice storm and insisted that they keep the extra platter of chicken that was mistakenly given to them, and gave them their correct order on top of that.   Note that this place is definitely a takeout place, but service is quick and you won't be waiting for long."}
{"text":"Hidden?  Yes, definitely.  Gem?  I'd say so.  Older, West Indian-Asian man was quite friendly.  And I can only assume that he was the owner.  The setting reminded me of one of those small, late 70s business that are on the subway level.  Lotsa brown  I ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich (under $5) and it was a bit dry, a bit too salty (but still quite edible), but overall quite tasty!  If I had a choice between a sub vs. this Jerk Chicken Sandwich, I'd definitely get the JC Sandwich, no doubt about that.  Also got a coupla patties to-go, 1 spicy, 1 mild.  When I got 'round to eating it later on, it was also a bit dry.  Then again, I didn't reheat it in any way.  So I'm sure reheating would've gone a long way!  However, if I had the choice between a from-freezer patty vs. this homemade patty, I'd definitely choose the Allwyn's!  So great price points + homemade will bring me back for another visit!  TAKEOUT ONLY."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken jerk sandwich. Not a fan of the coco bread, the chicken was meh. Beef patties were terrible."}
{"text":"I had the small Jerk Chicken Rice and Peas and the Stuffed Sandwich and I was plenty content after that.  The portions are really generous here so I'm glad I only order a small instead of the large.  I wished the Jerk Chicken had more \"jerk\" taste to it but regardless, it still had good flavour."}
{"text":"I tried the jerk chicken sandwich and beef patty yesterday. My first impression of my sandwich was the meat was incredibly moist and my sandwich was stuffed with it, feels like an entire chicken breast was in it, I could barely finish it, the bun was also very soft and taste like it's fresh made. the patty is definitely larger than the ones we get in the subways during commute and it has an incredible beefy flavor.  This was a mostly take out place, but there was a table and no one was sitting there so we lucked out."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in Toronto!!!  I tried this place for the first time a couple weeks ago. Didn't have much expectations. I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich with coleslaw inside and it was phenomenal!!  The chicken was so tender and tasty, mixed with the crunch of the coleslaw and soft warm bread. It was to die for. I was extremely hungry so maybe that was why it was so good.  So I came back a couple days later.... it was still bomb.com"}
{"text":"Decent place hole in the wall. Sizes are hearty and prices are decent. Jerk chicken was spicy and pretty good, and rice and beans was very good. The patty was okay, nothing special.   Had a pretty decent flow of traffic inside the store, so food is pretty fresh. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"New location, same awesome jerk sandwiches and patties.  It's in a slightly less sketchy plaza now, but it's still not the kind of place you'd wander into without being told about.  So...I'm telling you about it...do yourself a favour and check it out.  Get the jerk chicken sandwich and if you're feeling hungry, get a spicy patty to go along with it.  A sandwich, patty and pop is under $7!"}
{"text":"Went there again yesterday.  Update:  patties still good, curry goat disappointing (fatty pieces of meat) but the OXTAIL WAS SUPERB!  I really love this place.  Four star from five due to the curry goat disappointment.  Also:  peas and rice is extremely fluffy and gorgeous, melt in your mouth.  I love Allwyn's Bakery."}
{"text":"Someone told me their patties are the best in town. That person was very mistaken. Not only is this not the best, but the food was subpar compared to many other Caribbean restaurants i've been to.   The best way to describe this place is hole in the wall with acceptable food in large portions. If you judge quality by the amount you get, then this place is a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, I regularly take my 3 year old brother here after school and he eats the entire jerk chicken sandwich (which is so delicious and filled with chicken), the pricing is also very reasonable so the students from the school across the street all go there to buy lunch.  The owners and employees are good, hard working people that deserve every penny that goes into their pockets.  They did not invest much into the interior, so it's not the type of place you would sit to enjoy your meal with friends/date. Costumers are constantly coming in and out of there. It has a couple of tables but its more of a \"grab n go\" type of place... they are also clean and handle their food well (gloving, prongs, clean countertops/kitchen area, hair nets. Etc).   Allwyn's is a gem."}
{"text":"Man, where do I even start with this place? It's been a staple in my life ever since I was in the 3rd grade and Allwyn's was in the York Mills area. The place where I had my first ever beef patty, and after years of trying different patty spots Allwyn's still reigns supreme.  The shell used in the patties here are so flaky and wonderful and I honestly have not had patties that even come close to resembling them in terms of texture, flavour, and overall taste. Basically what I'm saying is, if you haven't tried the beef patties here, TRY 'EM RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"I had the toughest time trying to find this plaza. It's hidden in the back of the green towers. If you enter from the Poke Eats entrance, follow the hallway to the end and then turn right.   Once I got there, I was delighted with a host of takeout options. I decided to try the jerk chicken rice and peas. Their chicken was tender and the sauce was just the right amount of spicy. I asked them for some gravy and they also slab on some coleslaw to help with the heat. It's now one of my staples for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Allwyn's is an interesting jerk place. It's not bad, but it's not GREAT. One of the important factors in my Caribbean food evaluation is price to quality ratio. Usually you can find outstanding, flavourful, home cooked food for seemingly unreasonably good deals. This isn't the case at Allwyn's. They're rendition of jerk isn't that typical either, it's got no bone, tends to be on the drier side, isn't particularly flavourful and doesn't have that soul food feel. Not bad, just not my favourite."}
{"text":"This is a north location of famous Allwyn's bakery placed in foodcourt at emerald condo. Generous food portion! I really liked their jerk chicken. Will definitely come back f0r that, and also would like to try their coco bun patty:)"}
{"text":"Came here based on a friend's recommendation for the Jamaican patties. The hype was not what was set at. The patties were strangely shaped and had no flavour. The spicy ones tasted like just lack pepper. Order oxtail with rice and peas and the ox tail tasted like it was just stew an hour ago, the spicy and savoury level was not infused at all. The rice and peas was nothing as well. I normally don't go to Scarborough and I guess this is the reason why. The jerk wings didn't tickle my taste buds either. I don't usually make bad reviews but I walked in with a standard and it did not hold.   Quite the disappointment."}
{"text":"I wish I listened to other Yelpers by ordering the jerk chicken sandwich but instead I ordered the small jerk with rice and peas and coleslaw. Not that it's bad, it just wasn't a differentiator. We also got the ox tail and let's just say, I had better. The flavour is there but the texture was a bit lacking. Lastly, the spicy beef patty, it certainly got a kick to it. My mouth was on fire after 3 bites.  Don't think I'm cut out for spicy patties, good flavour tho.   Overall, unless you are in the area, there's no reason to purposely make a trip here as to eat because it is primarily a take out joint.  We got lucky and sat at the one and only table.  While we sat and ate, there was a constant flow of customers coming in for take out."}
{"text":"This takeout place is an awesome addition to the predominantly Asian food court that it's located in. We tried the stuffed sandwich which consists of a Jamaican patty, stuffed with jerk chicken and coleslaw and then stuffed into a piece of coco bread which is a lovely soft bun, almost similar to Hong Kong bakery bread. The jerk chicken pieces are delicious and flavourful and the coleslaw was crunchy and fresh tasting. The patty is a bit thinner than most I've had but the flavour was good and the pastry felt homemade.   The prices are a bargain, everything under $10, most things under $5. The stuffed sandwich was $4.99 which is great value, it's filling and substantial. We also had the patty stuffed coco bread sandwich which was $2.99 I think.   The place looks really clean, it is a new food court so everything is really immaculate. The girl at the counter was nice enough, our food took seconds to come out.   I can't wait to try the jerk chicken and rice combos, I think this is what they're most known for. I believe these combos are pretty inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Amazing jerk chicken at an incredibly low price. The jerk chicken sandwiches are served on a sweet and fluffy coco bread and will only run you 4.25 a pop. Be sure to ask for coleslaw on your sandwich.... They have the best creamy coleslaw I have ever had. It compliments the chicken perfectly. The jerk chicken dinner is also delicious with a side if rice and beans covered in their flavourful oxtail gravy."}
{"text":"Being a lover of West Indian food, I was pleasantly surprised to discover this place quite close to my work.  I have eaten at Mr.Jerk, Albert's and various Caribbean joints around the city, so I was excited to try this place. After reading some reviews on Yelp, I decided to grab some takeout.  First impression, as others have mentioned this place is located in a strip mall. It does not take debit or credit card so make sure you have cash! The plaza doesn't even have an ATM, I ended up going next door to the variety store and paying an extra 2 bucks to get cash.  I ordered the beef patty, oxtail, and jerk pork dinners. The beef patty was amazing! The flaky shell and the beef had a kick to it. I would say it's one of the best patties I have EVER had. The oxtail was flavourful and portions are a good size, I found the jerk pork very tender and juicy.   I have read a lot about the jerk sandwich and will try that next time.  All in all, this place was good, not great! Scarborough has many other jerk places that are better, but it's a good option if you crave this food and your in the area"}
{"text":"My favourite jerk place in the city. Been devouring their sandwiches and chicken dinners for 10 years and I can never get enough. Great value and service. So happy to see them get the recognition and success they deserve. Always fresh, flavourful and juicy  with good portions. Sandwiches, dinners and jerk wings(when in stock) are all must? try. Thank you Allwyns!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken sandwich in the city. Can't read the guy at the counter though. He either loves me or hates me. What is going through his head I will never know, but damn do they know how to make a good sammich."}
{"text":"Stopped by last week to finally try the supposed \"best jerk chicken sandwich\" in town. On one hand it was nice to get a jerk chicken order not smothered in molasses, as is the norm these days, on the other, the spice mix of the rather dry jerk seasoning was missing a little something flavour wise. It was disappointingly only O.K, not really something I'll be going out of my way for to try again. The serving size though was quite ample for the relatively modest price, and the chicken well cooked, so if I'm in the area, I'm not adverse to giving it another go, even if it's not actually the best jerk in town."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken stuff patty was good. The coco bread it always delicious, well priced snack very filling.."}
{"text":"Wow, I couldn't believe it! This is probably one of Toronto's best kept secrets! I was taken to Allwyn today by a friend who's been singing in my ear about it for months! As soon as we stepped into this tucked away shop I knew I was in for a treat! That distinct smell of sugary goodness used in Caribbean baked goods gets you salivating even before the hilarious co-owner C.K. can ask what you're doing in his store!! C.K. is a very entertaining fellow, for one he was mad at my friend for introducing me to the shop saying that he's already so busy making food for the customers and now I'm going to become another addict! He then went on to tell me how welcomed he felt when he moved to Canada and saw everybody wearing clothes with his name on it! He also doesn't believe in advertising, because he has enough trouble keeping up with customers who find the hidden shop through word of mouth. Long story short, I'd recommend checking out this place for meeting this dude even if you don't like jerk!  On to the food, the jerk chicken sandwich is maybe the best I've had. The fresh, in store baked coco bun makes such a very big difference, and the chicken itself is very tender and flavourful. There are a variety of other options including patties, goat curry, pork, and also a few varieties of bread (raisin loaves are recommended), but if it's your first time trekking to this spot, you can't go wrong with jerk chicken sandwich at just under $4.   Overall a solid 4.5 stars and definitely worth a try if you like Carribean food prepared by the awesome duo that run this place!"}
{"text":"I found this place about 3 yrs ago and have gone there at least once a week since. My staple is either the jerk pork or chicken sandwich and it's by far the best $3.95 you'll ever spend!  The breads are always fresh and the soups on the weekends are pretty tasty. My only slight complaint is that the jerk could be a bit spicier but it would never stop me from ordering.  If you've never been and you're in the neighbourhood, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Bought beef patties, 12 for $15.  They were presented without \"care\" inside a nameless box.  The patties were warm but not crispy/flaky; maybe they were microwaved. Taste is not authentic.  Not worth the price.   This place only takes cash. Situated in Scarborough (Lawrence & west of Victoria Park).    Patties Express are better, 12 for $14.95 and they accept credit cards; flaky and freshly done.  Located in downtown Toronto....yet very affordable."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and price is decent. Great for takeout and their jerk chicken is awesome cause they don't need to drench it in gravy and it's still flavourful!"}
{"text":"I got ox tail with rice and peas and was very disappointed the ox tail does Not fall off the bone like it should it was very bland and dry. The rice was okay nothing special. Not worth the money I got large size for $11.95  The jerk chicken sandwich was pretty good though and for good price"}
{"text":"This place serves up great carribean take out food.  Nestled right beside a valumart, a regular person wouldnt even know that this place existed.  But once you've tried their food you'll keep on coming back, i guarantee you. There is great value in their food, it will surely fill you up.  Their best seller is the jerk chicken sandwich, its a portable meal that you can eat with your hands.  The coco bun they use for the sandwich is warm and soft to the touch.  The jerk chicken is perfectly cooked and moist.  And it even comes with coleslaw.  A very well rounded taste profile, from a simple meal.  Next best item they have is the beef patty on a cocobun.  I dont know who invented that, but God bless them.  It so good, with the spicy beef patty with its flaky crust and flavourful filling, and put in between a soft, warm cocobun.  The perfect combination.  So if you're ever in this area try it out."}
{"text":"Finding this place was a mission for me since it was located in an almost-isolated-but-not-really-isolated building next to the subway station haha. I wanted to try their jerk chicken sandwich for awhile and when I did, I had no regrets! They gave a good amount of meat and it was really juicy and full of flavor. I came back and had their jerk chicken on rice. That was good as well but I enjoyed it on a sandwich much more. One other point to add is that their coleslaw is some good stuff!!! Service was nice and quick, I went before they had rush hour so there was no line up."}
{"text":"From what I've found online, Allwyn's Bakery has been around for a very long time, and is a staple for anyone that loves Jamaican patties.  When I have cravings for Jamaican patties, if I'm at work, my coworker takes me to this place that's close by her house.  The name escapes me at the moment.  If I'm at home, I used to go to Allan's Pastry Shop inside Peanut Plaza.  But as of the last couple of years, it seems like Allan's started skimp out on the fillings.  Not only is the filling less, but it looks and tastes like there's more filler, cornstarchy gumminess, and minimal meat.  I have to say, their outside is still nice and flakey though, which I love.  Allwyn's Bakery's Jamaican patties are a bit different than Allan's.  The outside is less flakey, and more like a cross between a pie dough and the normal Jamaican patty exterior.  There is a good amount of filling whether it is chicken or beef (we got one of each), and the filling is actual meat, not much in terms of fillers.  You can see the actual meat pieces."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken Sandwich,   That's all you need to know. It's the perfect amount of sweet, tender chicken tighs and spicy and flavourful seasoning. They got just enough crunch with the coleslaw and bun in perfect.   Don't wait, go now! Although the few time I've been there is been lined up at the door (Peek times). Great for a snack or a meal."}
{"text":"So cheap and so good! Ordered 2 patties and 2 jerk chicken on coco bread and coleslaw with 1 pineapple drink and it only added up to $14 at the time we went. Highly recommend everyone checkout restaurant. They open 11:30am and noon on Sundays."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I love this place. Best jerk chicken I've tried. Best patties too. If you haven't gone. Go! Go now!"}
{"text":"After I tried to go to their old location, I noticed a sign deep in the alley way that they had moved. Hopped in the car and drove the 4 minutes south to 81 Underhill Drive.   Grabbed the jerk chicken dinner (large) which isn't so big, but enough to fill you up. I was very surprised the jerk chicken came boneless. What a treat! Only issue would be that I wish there was more chicken, it was so tasty! Will be coming back now that it is closer to my work."}
{"text":"Sooo ... my sisters and I were in the area had a craving for a patty and maybe some jerk.  Arrived to the plaza and the restaurant is located in the corner against the wall.  Small and simple.  Prices are good.  We got a small oxtail with rice and peas, jerk wings and half a dozen of patties (chicken, spicy and mild).  Oxtail with rice and peas - the oxtail was bland the flavour hadn't settled in.  Maybe add a little more flavour and cook it longer.  The rice was again bland, again a little more flavour would have bring it up another star.  The was coleslaw too, that was also disappointing.  Slaw should be creamy to offset the flavour of oxtail or any other Caribbean pairings.  There is a base just need to add flavour.  Jerk wings - couldn't taste the jerk flavour.  There was a noticeable soy flavour base.  Jerk has a smoky flavour and gives you a spicy kick.  Didn't get any of that.  Can't see the actual jerk chicken being any better.  Patties -  as I have rated the overall experience they were a 2 out of 5.  The shell was disappointing - it should be flaky so when you bite into it, it would look like someone layered sheet by sheet.  The shell was tough and it took some effort to bite through it.   This applied to all flavours of patties.  Mild Patty - it was bland. Similar to the other items it was just missing the flavour.  The filling was a little dry and lacking in meat.  Spicy Patty - spice is suppose to amplify the existing flavour and since it was already bland it just tasted like pepper.  Not as dry.  Chicken Patty - I tried this one last and this is how you know the shell needs work.  It had cooled down a little and the shell was tough!  I was a cracker patty at that point.  The filling again bland missing just a little bit more flavour and it because it's spicy it was just a pepper flavour and still dry.  Overall, my first and only experience was a let down.  Even though there was such a high bar set the actual experience wasn't even half of it.  My comparison is my experience with places such as Ritz, Randy's and other small mama poppa shops.  I would say that is an even playing field.    Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Hidden in a dingey runned down plaza, this place is small cramped, poor ventilation but surprisingly has some pretty good food.  beef patties are made fresh here and still on the trays.  They also bake coco bread and different types of bread.  although you do not really see the food being made infront of you ... its really not bad.. price is affordable as well.  2.25 for patty on coco bread with coleslaw... good snack"}
{"text":"I have had their jerk chicken sandwich with Coleslaw, their beans and rice, and their patty with coco bread previously. I like the jerk chicken sandwich but when i brought it home to my parents who lived in Jamaica for over 7 years and they didn't like it.  Said while the jerk chicken part wasnt bad, the bread and the beans and rice were not what they had in jamaica.  That being said, their jerk chicken is juicy and a lot of people like its flavour and love that jerk chicken sandwich with coleslaw.  Nothing wrong with that.  Try it with an open mind, maybe consider it a Canadianized or fusion version of Caribbean food.  I deducted one star for that reason and another star because I think their prices are a little high for the quality of food that you get."}
{"text":"Great little go to jerk place in the area.  Moist and tender jerk chicken that never disappoints and also pretty good jerk pork. Really good price point, you can buy a combo with rice and peas and a coleslaw side or you can get the meat by the pound.   As for the jerk flavouring itself , I think is amazingly balanced with all the traditional jerk flavour and I think just the right amount of spicy, a bit on the mild side but enough to let all the other flavours come through.   I've also tried their beef patties, they are a bit different then other patties I've tried, mainly they are made with a more flakey pastry type shell which is a welcome change and I very much liked it. The beef inside was also good and wasn't dried out as some patties might get."}
{"text":"Although it isnt listed yet i visited the new Allwyns Bakery at Yonge and Sheppard and tried the Jerk chicken sandwich with coleslaw.   Not bad for a chicken sandwich for $5.  Not too spicy but good spice flavour.  The bun is like a flat hotdog bun."}
{"text":"I checked out Allwyns not long after it opened.  I heard their jerk chicken was really popular.  I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich.  It was pretty flavourful.  Not toonspicy or salty for a lightweight like me.  It comes on a soft bun and although it was great for the chicken it did soak up a lot of the jerk sauce.  Overall pretty good value for the price about $6.  Would like to see other options to go with it maybe."}
{"text":"This second location of Allwyn's can be found within the food court of the Emerald Park condo building. The original location is widely considered to be one of the best Caribbean restaurants in Toronto. Hence, I was excited to finally try their food at this newest outpost.   I tried their \"Stuffed\" sandwich that consisted of jerk chicken and coleslaw stuffed inside of a beef patty, which was then stuffed into one of their Coco bread buns. This sandwich tasted amazing and had great flavor and texture to it. The highlight of the sandwich was actually the Coco bread, as it was soft and provided a sweet contrast to the spiciness of the jerk chicken and patty. A highly recommended item to try!  I also tried their jerk chicken and rice option, which I would describe as being a fairly standard dish for Caribbean food. Allwyn's jerk chicken is famous for being boneless, which makes their version of the dish less messy to eat than usual. The jerk chicken was good but not the best I have eaten, however. I thought  that it tasted mostly spicy with some decent jerk flavour in it.  Overall, a good Caribbean joint for takeout and a quick snack. Definitely try their sandwiches if you can! =)"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Worth a trip just for the jerk chicken on cocobread w/slaw.   A real hole in the wall,.. but is darn tasty!  Every time I pass by, I stop for a sandwich or 2."}
