{"text":"I tried Familia for the first time last week, and it was so good that we decided to order in for lunch yesterday, too. On the first visit, we ate at the restaurant and tried the Garlic Parmesan, mild and buffalo wings and a Philly Cheesesteak pizza. The garlic Parmesan wings and the cheesesteak pizza were the standouts of the experience, and the leftover sauce from the wings was an excellent dipping sauce for the pizza crust, too! The hot buffalo wings were really interesting and worth a mention. They aren't very hot, but they taste a little like BBQ Fritos. Strange, I know, but worth a try if you like BBQ Fritos. I didn't mind them, but I was much more impressed with the Garlic Parmesan flavor.

The staff was very friendly and attentive and the space was clean and orderly, too. I'd love to see this business grow to need a slightly larger location and to offer beer to go with their food. 

We were delighted to find out that Familia will deliver to our house when we visited the restaurant, so we ordered in lunch yesterday for a get-together with friends. The 2nd experience was every bit as good as the first. We opted to try out the veggie and 5 meat pizzas this time, and we also ordered them with one of their flavored crusts. The veggie pie with ranch crust is fantastic! We also tried the garlic knots and highly recommend them. We had been craving the garlic Parmesan wings all week, so we got some more of those and also tried the Honey BBQ flavor. Because we had been too full the week before for dessert, we made it a point to order the fried cheesecake this time, too. Everything was delicious!

This place is truly a hidden gem in the Matthews/Mint Hill area, and one of the only non-chain places that will deliver to our neighborhood. Needless to say, Familia will be our new go-to for pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time since we moved to the area, 7 years ago. It is a small \"Mom and Pop\" kind of place. The staff was on point and very friendly. We got the Philly Cheese pizza and wings. Since we ordered 18 wings, we decided to try 3 different flavors: Mild, Buffalo and Garlic Parmesan. Everything was great. We really wanted to try their cheesecake wrap, but didn't leave any room for dessert. I guess we'll just have to go back. :)"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte and was hoping to have some local pizza delivered as opposed to the typical chains I usually order.  

Familia Pizza and Wings would not deliver to my house because I live 5 miles away and their policy limits deliveries to only 4 miles away.  

I guess at 5 pm on a Tuesday they were too busy to take the extra 3 minute drive.

I'm calling Dominos."}
{"text":"I also enjoyed the food from Familia Pizza and Wings, the slices are super big and good.  The wings were really good also, I ate there when they first opened up and the staff are really nice and made sure I was satisfied to the point where they forgot to bring me something they went back and got it and brought it back to me which I thought was really cool.  Not too many restaurants that deliver will even think about doing such a thing most of them will tell you of well we will just give you a credit but not this place very nice."}
{"text":"Familia pizza is an absolute hidden gem. It seems like it takes forever to get a pie, but when you do, you understand why it took so long - it was made fresh by hand and it tastes like it! The prices are incredible and every person with whom I've shared my pizza raves about it. This is one classic mom and pop pizza joint you can't miss!"}
