{"text":"Great tasting food with attentive and knowledgable service. Family dinner with our 11-year old was a pleasure."}
{"text":"The pizzeria is definitely worth visiting for numerous reasons, including and not limited to:
(1) Authentic Neapolitan pizza
(2) Great wine list
(3) Good place to take your date
(4) Great service.

The pizza was really thin and crispy which I loved so it wasn't difficult finishing it. We had great service, and the entire menu at Nolana was quite affordable which we appreciated. I would definitely go back whenever I crave Italian pizza!"}
{"text":"Continuing on our pizza crawl (like a pub crawl... but with pizza.... and on different nights...) Anyhooo, who cares why... went to Nolana last night for dinner.  Saw the train car-like space (long and narrow) and thought, I'm gonna hate this... too squishy.  Wrong!!  I walked in and was warmly greeted- seated and thus began a great experience.  Waitstaff was genuine, knowledgeable (recommended a great wine) and the food was fantastic.... Only complaint was the mostarda that was a little heavy on the sweet and lacking in the sour part (please.... more vinegar or acid).  The coppa was a standout on the shared salumi plate, the polpette - although served on a dollhouse sized plate (read teeny, weeny, tiny) was tender, moist and very tasty- and the pizzas.....  Score!!!  And scissors.  Yes, scissors.  Genius!!!!  I always hate hate hate destroying my pizza trying to cut a slice with a dullish knife that seems de rigueur in most Italian restaurants... but these people give you uber sharp scissors.  Genius!!  Love the ambiance, the tables, the comfy chairs, the large windows.... Love it all.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellente ils un peu trop cher servi sur une planche en bois avec une paire de ciseau glissée dessous. 

Tout cela est une excellente idée, sauf que la planche en bois est brisée et laisse entrer les bactéries et la vis de la paire de ciseau est rouillée et sale. Bref, c'est un peu déguelasse. 

Les prix sont exagérés car pour le midi, une pizza et un coke pour près de 30$ c'est beaucoup trop cher."}
{"text":"Great pizza and drinks. Great location. Would definitely come back. Staff was very friendly. Pizzas are a meal for one (if you are hungry). Dessert donuts were grand."}
{"text":"Que du bonheur!! Les plats sont au top et tout particulièrement les pizzas. Le service est également au top avec de très bons conseils sur les vins. Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés même avec des enfants. Merci à toute l'équipe pour ce pur moment de plaisir!"}
{"text":"Limited menu, but I loved everything that we ordered. Three Fungi pizza was the best!"}
{"text":"Their pizza respect Italy style : a perfect fire cooked crust, premium fresh ingredients and simplicity... Try the porchetta one, it remember's me the Amalfi coast"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Style is hybrid Montreal style pizza and classic napolitan pizza. Strongly recommend the Uova pizza. Cozy spot. The meatball appetizer and octopus are both excellent."}
{"text":"Decor&ambiance 5/5 staff&service 4/5 food 4/5
It's been 3 days I'm in still thinking about my funghi pizza! The place is small but cozy, located in old montreal next to a bunch of parking lots to use when street parking can be a challenge. The staff was very knowledgeable about their menu items and I loved the variety of pizza options. We started with the polpo style soppressatta (12$) (basically octopus that they stick together real tight to look like a thin slice of sausage) and then we both had our own pizzas, for me the funghi(23$) and for the man the alichi (15$). We were a bit disappointed with the octopus as we were expecting thicker slices to make it worth the 12$, but the salsa Verde that it came with was delicious although it felt more like a pesto. The pizzas were  served on a wood palet which really gave it an authentic pizzeria feel and we loved the concept of using scissors to cut our pizzas! We both thought our pizzas tasted great, their crust is somewhere in between thin and regular. They used garlic oil for the funghi pizza which brought out the flavor of the mushrooms but also used ricotta cheese to help calm down the strong flavor of the garlic oil. We ended our experience with their desert of the day, an adorable amd delicious chocolate pie. The crust was so buttery and the chocolate was just the right amount of sweet. Unfortunately we thought it took a while to get our food, about 15 minutes for the octopus then another 15-20 minutes for our pizzas, but it's clear that they make everything fresh on the spot so we definetly intend on going back."}
{"text":"Personal preference here but the dough is thick. All the ingredients tasted good, the style was just super heavy and bready. 

I wouldn't re-order but can say the food is good quality and somewhat higher than average price."}
{"text":"Great food great decor but even better service !!  Owners are very friendly ..
Pizza was very good but the meatballs, one of the best thing I've tasted in Montreal so far 
Can't wait to go back !!! 
Oh ya .. Nutella pizza and donuts as desserts , what else can I say !!!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Their spicy sauce that they make in house is quite good. The staff was very patient considering we had a toddler who would not stop crying."}
{"text":"A very crowded and noisy space which clashes with the style and menu. Service is mediocre; staff seem not to care. The pizza was quite good. I enjoyed the authentic tomato sauce, but not so much the large crust, could've gone with something thinner."}
{"text":"They have a variety of thin-crust personal-size pizza that are all seasoned well (balanced).  I suggest asking for their hot sauce (red pepper sauce) so you can mix it up.  Go with friends and order many different pies for a pizza tapas.  

Novelty aside, most of their flavoring are good, but flawed.  Their octopus aren't the freshest, prosciutto gets overcooked since they just cook it the same way, and their \"egg\" pizza is overwhelmed by blue cheese.  Considering the price they charge for pies, it feels overpriced."}
{"text":"Arrived into Montreal and needed a quick evening bite to eat with an employee.  Nolana was the perfect place.  Casual rustic pizza place close to Old Montreal.  Gnocchi and pizza was very good and wine selection was decent.  Service was very good.  Half way through dinner the power went out on the entire city block but the servers didn't miss a beat.  Candles were lit and the food and wine kept coming.  They handled he situation perfectly and even got out the old carbon copy credit card machine to run the bill.  If you want a cozy casual pizza place in Montreal this is the place."}
{"text":"This place caught our eye from the street, it looks quaint.

The wine was superb, great selection.  It was very clean, cosy, warm and great decor.

The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful, always very attentive to making sure our wine and water glasses were full, they knew all about the food and helped with their suggestions.

The food was phenomenal, I had the uova pizza and I couldn't even carry a conversation with my husband because I was lost in the taste.  I am so sad we don't have this in Toronto.

Also, I was slightly in love with the fact that they had some of the best music on- it was really awesome motown, which just added to the fun atmosphere.

I love this place and cannot wait to go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here after flying into Montreal and enjoying a few cocktails before we were hit with the dinner HUNGER. Pizza seemed like the perfect choice. Nolana was in the right price range and close to where we were staying in Old Montreal. We were not disappointed. My husband ordered the meatball appetizer (amazing) and the uova pizza which was phenomenal. I had the zucchine pizza, a solid vege option, though I have to admit I was slightly jealous of his prosciutto-covered entree. We enjoyed a few beers and glasses of wine courtesy of a lovely, efficient bartender. Loved the ambience at the bar as well - laid back but still bustling. We would definitely come back again when we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Très bon mais pas pour tous les budgets ! Les boulettes dont délicieuses, les pâtes et la pizza cuite du goût à bois également Bruyant sur l'heure du midi, car restaurant tres plein. 
Service leeeent...."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious except the spaghetti appetizer. The pork belly pizza was absolutely incredible and the eggplant was to die for!!! The service was on on point! I would definitely go there again!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is really going down the drain. From the same owners (I believe) of Commerce and Tapas 24, been coming here since it opened...but never was as \"blah\" as this time.

Porchetta Pizza with barely a few slices of porchetta on it and the rochette salad was faded and old, at best. C'mon people....give me what I paid for. Not cool. 

Prosciutto and patate pizza was good.

There are better choices on McGill avenue (Notably:  Holders; Jellyfish Crudo etc...), hard brutal truth. Not going anytime soon.

2 pizza, 2 beers, cheap Eska (why don't they carry / can't we have San Pellegrino...what is this North Korea???) and a macchiato for roughly $90...nough said."}
{"text":"An oddly-shaped Italian restaurant in old Montreal. Full marks for the decor and the service, which was both friendly and knowledgeable. The food isn't bad either. The favorites at our table were the meatball and the margherita pizza."}
{"text":"The dinner started off on such a high note. A lovely quaint little restaurant with EXCELLENT service... that is until you order your food. There was water leaking from the AC unit above us, and we told the server this, and he did not offer to move us and just told us there was nothing he could do. Our glasses of water and wine also stopped being filled about halfway through the meal (despite having bought a bottle of sparkling water and wine)... Our appetizers were quite good, I had the stuffed eggplant and my husband the panino rustico. Our entrées were very disappointing however. We are on the eternal search for Naples-style pizza, having loved it so much in Italy. However this fell short. The crust was thin, but not fully cooked in the middle. Moreover, I'm sorry to say but tomato sauce is the basis of Italian cooking, and if you fail at making a tasty sauce, your food comes out tasteless, and this is unfortunately what happened to my pizza (Margherita). I did appreciate the fresh Mozzarella. My husband ordered the aubergine/ricotta piatti... It tasted like a pizza-pocket. So despite really wanting to like this restaurant, we were very disappointed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"I reserved a table for 11pm with my girlfriend. Arrived 5 minutes early for my reservation to find the restaurant door locked. Waite4 saw me and refused to open for first few minutes until I started knocking on the door.
When he opened he was condescending and blamed opentable for the \"mishap\". 
Not sure why I gave this place another chance after a mediocre pizza and rude service my first time around."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed by the service staff who were pleasant, relaxed and attentive. The food itself was simply delicious! The meatball appetizer was very tender, the mozzarella salad savorous and the pizza's blend of spices and herbs gave it a delicate, and definitively different, bouquet of flavour. 

We shared three fire roasted pizzas and each were delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome small place! New York kinda feel ;) Their chef has worked at Da Emma before, he knows what he is doing with the pizza dough... Super fresh. And you get to cut your pizza with cisors. Though, I found that the pizzas sometimes lack a bit of sauce and/or dressing. But overall excellent.

Loved the eggplant appetizer. Everytime I go there I sit at the bar, the service is excellent and you feel just like home :-)"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Will be coming back here. We ordered the margharita pizza and the ragu pasta, which was excellent. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Had a pretty bad experience. The food was good,  but the service made us feel rushed and unwelcome. Dishes were picked up from the table before everyone was finished, while some were still chewing on the last bite... Later, our deserts were waiting to be served on the bar next to us for 5-6 minutes (it didn't affect their quality, just annoying). Will probably not be coming back, even though we liked the pizza, and also their interpretation of cannoli. It's just not worth getting the kind of cold treatment that you receive here. Get your Italian somewhere else."}
{"text":"La nourriture est délicieuse, le cadre est mignon mais malheureusement le service est exécrable. Notre serveur était désagréable, notre commande a mis très longtemps à arriver et après avoir demandé le reste de notre nourriture pour emporter, nous nous sommes rendus compte que la moitié n'était pas là ! 
C'est vraiment dommage car cette jolie pizzeria est pleine de potentiel."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza place that my boyfriend found on yelp (thanks yelp!) It was a short walk from our hotel- look for the short long restaurant!
Started off with the panino rustico- made me think of a quiche, but not as dense. You get 4 logs of delicious cheesy and eggy delight, with pieces of zucchini.
For our main dishes, we got the Uova pizza (egg yolk, pancetta, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzarella) and the special risotto of the day (mushroom risotto topped with scraps of parmesan and arugala). The pizza (which you cut with a pair of scissors- what a clean and innovative way to slice! and SO satisfying) was piping hot and straight out of the oven, with the cheese nicely melted. Great gorgonzola flavor.
The risotto was the star of the meal for me- filled with a variety of mushrooms, the sharp flavor of the arugala complimented the dish. If its available, definitely order it!

Great meal and cute décor- nice place for a cute date or to catch up with friends and family."}
{"text":"A nicely designed, modern-chic restaurant with a bit of a New York look and feel! The lighting perfect and the atmosphere cosy and quiet. My girlfriend and I went for lunch so it wasn't busy. The server greeted us with menus immediately and was nicely educated on the wine list, perfectly describing the taste of the wine we ordered. 

We had the Polpetta di Carne (meatball) to start which was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend ordered the Nolana pasta while I stuck to a classic sausage pizza (The Salsiccia). The pasta noodles had a homemade taste and feel, served in an egg yolk sauce. The pizza, baked in a wood oven with sausage, fresh basil and ricotta cheese served with a scissors to cut your slices however you want! I actually liked that! Was definitely happy with our lunch there!

I approve! 5 stars for service, location and decor and of course the food!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant that I've been to in Montreal. It was so delicious. The wine was amazing, the pizza was even better, and the dessert...it was out of this world. I was super nervous when I ordered a strawberry cheesecake pizza for dessert... But it was the BEST dessert I've had in years. I wanted to order another one to bring home and share with my family. It was so delicious. I HIGHLY suggest coming to this restaurant, it is AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, warm decor, combined with the promise inherent to a nice pizza oven.  One pizza was good (wova), and the other might as well have been a block of salt. Totally inedible, and I do like anchovies.  I probably didn't make the best choice to begin with, sure, but upon sharing my experience, and calmly inquiring - is it always this salty? - the server was totally unhelpful, and didn't lift a finger (I dunno, a complimentary appetizer, whatever) even after picking up my pizza, completely uneaten at the end of the meal. Charged full price too. Was pretty disappointing. Never going back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place. The decor is cute and rustic. The service was good.
Now the food. There was no hot bread, some basic pizza restaurant items were missing and the pizza had no flavor."}
{"text":"En arrivant un jeudi soir pour souper sans réservation, le serveur nous a quand même trouvé une table. Bon choix de pizza traditionnelle cuite au four à bois.  La pâte est moelleuse. Les pâtes Carbonara était aussi très bonnes. Genre de plat de pâtes rustique avec gros morceaux de lardon et beaucoup de crème. Plat lourd mais délicieux. Nous avons demandé l'opinion de notre serveur pour un vin blanc et comme prévu , selon lui, c'était le plus dispendieux sur la carte qui était le meilleur choix. Je suis satisfait de mon repas en general. Le seul bémol est la quantité de vin servi au verre. Très petite portion mesurée et assez dispendieux. Niveau de bruit élevée. Le service fut très professionnel et amical."}
{"text":"really disapointing ! they were only 3 clients in the restaurent, and we waited 1 hours to get 2 pizzas. One of the pizza was really bad and we didn't even touch it. On top of that, they charge us that pizza that was not eatable.
Bad service, bad cuisine."}
{"text":"Nolana's an absolutely wonderful place for authentic Italian brick oven pizza in the Quartier international. I actually stumbled upon Nolana after having dinner across the way at Brit & Chips (https://www.yelp.com/biz/brit-and-chips-montr%C3%A9al-2?hrid=YJHASTuftSgO21kV2XYEcQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct) ), the restaurant having quite an enticing look, long and narrow, with a certain appeal that just draws you in - and, once I got a closer look, I immediately knew where I was going to be dining the next day.

I had the pizza salsiccia, featuring a very nice Italian sausage, nduja (which I admit having to look up on Wikipedia - it's a \"spicy, spreadable pork salume\" that's quite tasty), a perfectly balanced tomato sauce, and a good amount of ricotta. Into the brick oven all of that goes, and out comes a wonderful pizza with a crust that's nicely puffed around the sides. A knife and fork won't do here, where kitchen shears are the implement of choice, and it's a cool way to make your way into a really nice pizza. Pair it with a nice Italian beer and you've got the makings of a really nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great personal service, good selection of wine. Handmade pizza not overly salty and flavour well executed. Make sure to make reservation has this restaurant is very small and gets back very quickly. Recommended!

{"text":"Simply put, Nolana makes the best pizza in the city. You don't believe me? Go try it for yourself!

All their pizzas are baked in a traditional oven and served on a wooden cutting board. Metal scissors are also provided, making the business of pizza slicing easy and mess-free. From the dough they use to the sauces and toppings, the taste is succulent and everything is perfectly blended together. My favorites are the margherita and uova, but the funghi is also very good if you feel (financially) daring. Their homemade spicy sauce, served in a small glass jar, is perfection. 

Nolana also serves entrées and desserts, some of which I've tried; I've never been disappointed. Furthermore, they also have a decent wine list. Their coffee is fine, sometimes served with a sablé cookie on the side. Unfortunately, they do not have soy milk or almond milk so I don't order it too often.

The ambiance is another perk of this pizzeria; an elongated rectangular structure, the interior of Nolana is nicely decorated and looks well taken care of. Large windows offer a view of Montreal's Old Port, which my husband and I always appreciate when we visit. 

Nolana's service has always been excellent and the waiters are friendly. In spite of the restaurant's smaller size, we never had trouble getting a seat, though I would recommend making a reservation on busy nights and weekends just to make sure.

Nolana is one of my favorite spots in the city. It never fails to impress."}
{"text":"If you don't have reservations on weekdays at lunch time, you will have to sit at the bar. It's not necessarily a bad thing but be warned if you want a table seat. Service was friendly, quick and knowledgeable, it seemed like all three waiters/bartenders really knew the menu. We ordered the di finocchio salad (fennel, arugula and citrus), the porchetta pizza and the carosella pizza. I found the salad alright but lacking in.... something... perhaps salt or a pinch of salty cheese, I've had the aragula salad at Lemeac and all I taste in the dressing is oil, lemon and salt but it's the perfect mix so in comparaison, this particular salad was lacking in something to pair with the citrus flavor. My carosella pizza (rapini, nduja and prosciutto toppings) was awwwwesome! The saltiness from the prosciutto with the spice from the nduja and the slight bitterness of the rapini was a perfect blend of flavors. My husbands porchetta pizza (porchetta, salsa verde and aragula) was also very good but because I tried his after mine, it didn't have the kick that the carosella pizza had. All in all, we were in and out in less then an hour, so they are quick and we were well fed, will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting from Toronto & Ottawa.  I'm a regular at QM & Libretto in TO so I was looking for a comparable pizzeria in MTL - Nolana did not disappoint!  I order a Margherita and thought the dough was heavier, and less charred compared to other Neapolitans I have tried - which I thought was quite nice! 

Easy to access, prompt service, \"dressed up causal\" atmosphere and delicious! The scissors to cut your pizza with was a such a cute touch."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, and great atmosphere. I really recommend the pizza and if you prefer something else, grab the Tramezzino de Porchetta. The desserts were amazing and really unique"}
