{"text":"Our first visit tonight. Good food and very fast service. Very reasonably priced, and the menu has Many interesting dishes. Wednesdays have specials on their Margaritas, and Thursdays sport $1.99 beers. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So... went for dinner. Staff was very fast and super freindly. Salsa was pretty good, queso was pretty good. Hard beef taco pretty tasty. Rice good.   I got cheese enchiladas as well, and didnt like them at all. They had that odd fake like white cheese in them, not yummy, at all. In fact i didnt finish them.  Ill probably continue to go occasionally, but will be careful about what i choose.....  Atmosphere seemed fine."}
{"text":"Fantastic little find! Attentive, friendly, tri-lingual staff. Great views of the river and park if you can sit on the terrace. Great portion sizes, priced well. Don't forget the Sangria!"}
{"text":"I have always had hot and tasty meals at El Meson, but when my husband and I went there recently at my urging, since he had never been there before, I felt bad.  He said his meal was OK, but not great, and mine was barely warm and on the bland side, so I was very disappointed.  The service was very, very slow, which was a first at this restaurant, and it took so long to get our bill.  We went there between lunch and dinner, so it wasn't overly crowded.  For some reason, I still gave the waiter (one of three) a 20% tip; I guess I was feeling generous.  I don't believe I will be back here anytime soon, but will give them another chance sometime because this was a rarity."}
{"text":"Simply the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. The food is delicious the service is fast the price is low how can you go wrong."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant! I grew up in Cuyahoga Falls and moved to Columbus for college, and I still get El Meson every single time I'm back at home visiting my parents. Their food is so reasonably priced and everyone is very friendly. I recommend Jim's Nachos - I get them every time I go because they're so good!"}
{"text":"This was awful. Went there on a Friday night and ordered a daiquiri, expecting alcohol in it. Definitely did not have alcohol in it, so they had to bring it back and make it again, this time I *think* it had alcohol in it. The chips and salsa were awful. The food was really bland. The service was AWFUL. Only been here once and I didn't get a great impression of this place, will NEVER, EVER go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Order the seafood platter it was delicious the presentation was superb atmosphere great. It seems amazing that you can get such good value again with Quebec high standards of cuisine with such a great view I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I had dinner at El Meson for the first time with my father during my last visit to Ottawa. The food is absolutely delicious! But it was the fantastic service that will keep me coming back. The staff are wonderful! We had such a great time...in fact we ended up closing the restaurant down!  El Meson is easy to find. It's is in a charming old house on Beechwood in Vanier. There is parking at the side of the building as well as on the street."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, great ambiance and home feeling.  Summer time is amazing with the Terrasse.  Stop reading this review and come try it!"}
{"text":"Wao! Best mole in town!!!! Amazing service. Little pricy but worth it. Had Enchiladas and nolapito con lomito. Top rated!!!"}
{"text":"What's there to say its Mexican food. I am usually not a huge fan of Mexican restaurants cuz they just never really seem \"authentic.\" And stepping into this place by the looks of it you probably won't expect this one to be either. However the food was great a lot of good flavors everything was excellent! Oh and the service is fast. Drinks, appetizers, food it all came out fast. Over all great experience we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Every time I go to this place service is excellent. The food is always fast, fresh, and the portion sizes are more the adequate. The have a large menu and there is something for everyone. The also serve alcohol. Bottom line this in my opinion is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Akron area. You will not be disappointed if you visit el meson."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and the margaritas are really good. I always get the vegetarian #5 for myself, it's just too delicious to stray away from but my husband will mix it up and order different things and it's always very tasty. The food always comes out super fast, even when they're busy but it's definitely fresh and tastes great. We went to El Meson the other night and ordered take out, the guy told me it would be 5 minutes. 5 minutes??? I thought he meant 15 but it really did come out in right around 5 minutes. Crazy! How do they do it? In terms of other similar restaurants in the area (Mariachi Cocos/Locos, El Rincon, Azteca, etc.) the menu, food, and prices are all about the same but I think El Meson's food just tastes a little bit better than all the rest."}
{"text":"This very quaint and ideally located in Lachine away from all the  foodie hipsters was just good. I ordered the Gazpatcho to start which was probably the best thing i had. My main dish was the grilled chicken breast in a green Mole sauce with fried black beans and nicely seasoned rice. The service was very good!  While Carlos and Pepes it is NOT...it failed to blow me away. I am pretty sure there are better mexican restos to explore in the city but that being said there was nothing bad that stood out....well maybe the $7 lattes!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Cuyahoga Falls! Awesome food for a steal. The service is on point and the margaritas are delish :) Also can't beat their toasty chips & fresh salsa."}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican food in the area!!!  Steak fajitas...well done peppers and onions...rice...beans. When done right...does not get any better...and they do it right EVERY time.  I tried the food at Mexican restaurants all over the area (Akron/Cleveland) and it was always a little off. This place gets it right in all categories...especially taste!"}
{"text":"I have been going here at least once a week for the last 5 years, and have never had a bad meal.  This is one place I know I can take people and their only complaint is that they are stuck wanting El Meson!  The staff is amazing as is the food which is evident by the fact that this place is always busy. Once you try this place you will be in love!"}
{"text":"I like it here I come in pretty often it's cheap and the margaritas are strong I love it. I had a foreign exchange student at my school from Mexico and I brought her here and she said this was the best Mexican she had while in the US, so I mean hey an authentic Mexican girl herself can't be lying!"}
{"text":"I am always a fan of hidden gems. This is one of them. I try to eat here whenever I can. Unfortunately it is not close to my home so a special trip is usually in order.  The first thing I like about this place is the margaritas. Order a half pitcher for $6.00 on Wednesday and share with friends. Next, salsa is served in little containers that you pour into small, individual dishes, so no need to worry about double dipping or doctoring it up with hot sauce. Then be sure to order a side of the white cheese dip ($3.00), so smooth and tasty. Just enough for one, with a little left over to pour onto your food.  I have a few favorites at El Meson so I think whatever you order should be just fine. The cheese enchiladas topped with pork is my go-to, but I've also had various combinations. On my last visit I had a combination special (with beef) and was just as pleased. Throw in the cheese dip and a half-pitcher of margaritas and my bill, less tax and tip, was $20.00. If you just want to get in and get out you can probably eat for under ten dollars.  From the outside El Meson doesn't look like much. It was probably a now-defunct chain diner like Sambo's or Big Boy back in the 70's, but inside the staff is always friendly and accommodating and their service is fast. So, if you want to go to a newer cookie cutter Mexican Restaurant and spend twice what you will here, go ahead. It just leaves more room for me and my many friends who love good, basic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican Restaurant in Lachine, right by the water! Very good food and authentic atmosphere.  We were strolling around the area and decided to go in to try, was not disappointed! The sangria was great, the food too! Will come back more times!"}
{"text":"authentic Mexican restaurant. owned by Mexican family. Service is little bit slow but food is delicious."}
{"text":"Apparently the other reviewers have never had \"mexican\" food outside of quebec. Otherwise they would know that nothing they serve at this place is even close to being considered mexican food. Service was good, so that's what got them a full two stars instead of one. If you just want some random concoctions of food with sweet sauces, then this is your place."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican food! I have tried many dishes but always seem to go back to the chicken fajitas, cooked with their house made spicy sauce. Fantastic! Great fresh salsa, freshly fried tortilla chips, can't get much better. Their prices also make it affordable to go more often."}
{"text":"It's not perfect BUT this is probably the best most authentic mexican food place in all of Montreal. Service is always very friendly and helpful and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great Food!!! Quick service. Wednesday nite Margarita specials. The only thing American about this place is the location. Brush up on your Espanol."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good atmosphere.  Very small, and I always feel cramped when we go here.   Don't quite understand the use of cauliflower and zucchini in their Chori Pollo, but it is delicious.  Not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area, but it isn't one that I avoid.  Prices are decent, about par for the course."}
{"text":"This is our go to Mexican restaurant. The portions are large, and the food always tastes great. You're greeted at your table with chips & homemade salsa!  The staff is friendly and your food arrives quickly."}
{"text":"The best things about El Meson Mexican Restaurant:  1. The mexican food is what you need in your life 2. The margaritas will have you feelin' like it's income tax season after 2 sips 3. Service is muy rapido and food comes out quick 4. Two people can stuff their face for under $20 5. They take competitor coupons - take that Mi Rancho!  What more could you ask for? El Meson Mexican Restaurant is hands down the best Mexican restaurant around. Sometimes the line is long, but it goes quick. If you're trying to avoid the long line here's some pointers I thought of just for you:  1. Don't go on Cinco de Mayo 2. Don't go on a Friday night before high school football game 3. Remain calm you'll eventually be seated  Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner is the nicest guy I've ever met and the price to quality ratio is stellar."}
{"text":"Actually the best Mexican food in the area. The prices are amazing and the service is super fast.   I've never had anything bad there but my go-to is the Panchita Special (chicken, chorizo, cheese, & avocado over rice). It sounds very simple but it is top 5 favorite meals - the combo of flavors is ridiculously good.   It's a huge plate of food for a very reasonable price. Plus you get unlimited, delicious chips & salsa. I've never gone without getting the queso as well."}
{"text":"Of all the Mexican eateries in the area this one BLOWS ALL others away!!!  It is delicious!  It is authentic! The potato flautas (sp?) are a great appetizer and the Vegetarian #1 is amazing as well.  The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, but the servers are always polite and attentive.  The food always comes out incredibly fast.  The margaritas are delicious and they always have some sort of a special going for them.  They also accept any Mexican restaurant coupon up to $5.  The food is VERY reasonable as well.  Two people can eat there with appetizer for under $20 with drinks and appetizer.  The only Mexican place I will frequent in the area!"}
{"text":"Very friendly place to go eat. All my friends like to go there when they stop by. Simple Mexican food. No complaints."}
{"text":"Very cute and friendly Mexican restaurant on the canal. Large, tasty portions. At our table if 9, my favorite was the cactus salad. We also ordered fajitas, fish, enchiladas and tortilla soup - - all very good and well spiced. Not an extensive beer and wine menu, but a nice selection to choose from. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Cute little mexican place with a tiny terrasse right next to canal Lachine. They have very decent mexican food such as the fajitas. The portions are pretty good and you don't leave hungry at all.   Make sure you reserve before going if it's during a nice warm summer day because you won't get any places."}
{"text":"I go to eat here on occasion for lunch and really enjoy the food. There isn't a long wait for the food, the servers are friendly and always keep our drinks topped off."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices good portions.   I like going on Wednesday whem they have Margaritas on  special."}
{"text":"good food, best Mexican in the area.  Good value tasty and fans service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant Mexicain famillial. La nourriture est bien et le prix juste bon service."}
{"text":"This is our places! Food is amazing and quick, plus if you order things separately I swear your meal will be less than 7 bucks!"}
{"text":"I fly from Phoenix to just come here. Great food, great service and the owner is on the floor and talks to customers like they are one of the family."}
{"text":"Great service, every staff comes with big smiles. Decor in warm colors  that gives you a home-y feel. Pretty popular spot in an otherwise tranquil area. 4 star because both food and drinks we had that day were slightly too salty/sweet."}
{"text":"AWESOME MARGARITAS-- the mango frozen one is awesome. Fajita quesadilla was amazing. Great sized portions, chips and salsa also good. Will definitely be coming again"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican place!!! Food is great and comes out fast and staff is very friendly and helpful. Great cheap lunch combos and lots of drink options. Very clean and right on portage trail in Cuyahoga Falls. Lots of parking spots because it's in a mini shopping plaza. I always get the grilled chicken quesadilla and comes with rice and beans lunch combo number 8 can't go wrong. A great place for a quick lunch!!! $-$$"}
{"text":"Solid food. Really authentic and cool atmosphere. This place really is a hidden gem right by the lakeshore!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, kind service and delicious food. The mole sauce was very authentic with a kick. Amazing guacamole! Only issue was they did not have any high chairs which can be a challenge with toddlers."}
{"text":"I eat here often for lunch and the staff is attentive and friendly.  There is no bar per se but they serve margaritas 7 days a week.  The margaritas are not hand made and - though you can order your choice of several tequilas - they are made from a mix.  Even the Gold Margaritas contain little tequila and are too sweet.  They serve standard americanized mexican fare so don't expect authentic mexican food.  I like the shrimp fajitas but am careful about the day I order them.  Sometimes the shrimp aren't fresh and they are small and tough.  The wine choices are sadly lacking (standard for most american/mexican restaurants) and all wine is served cold (including red which is nearly freezing!)  This is a great place to go for fast service and sweet margaritas."}
{"text":"Fast service, fake margaritas, Americanized Mexican... great at what it is.  Don't go looking for a deep mole... or tortillas pressed table side.  They take coupons from their competition... have daily specials... different ones of lunch and for dinner.... and are really fast with service.  We have been there twice.  It was packed both times... once on a weeknight and the other on Friday night...   Beans and rice are nothing special... burittos are large and 2 meals worth.  Fajitas come with a \"15 min to make\" warning but come much faster.  They only come with 3 tortillas which left over 3 cups of meat and veggies to take home.  Margaritas are not from scratch... no idea what the other flavors look like... the only one I saw both times was plain lime... and when I ordered a half pitcher the waiter didn't ask what flavor... even though there is a card on the table from a commercial mix / distributor hinting that there are fruity options.  The cheesecake isn't really much cheesecake... it's 4 small bites covered in chocolate and hidden in whipped cream arranged around a \"fried ice cream\" ball that is coated in soggy corn flakes.  It is right around the corner from us... and there are piles of coupons that come in the mail for places farther away... so we will return when we aren't in the mood for the long drive to better places."}
{"text":"We were there for celebrating an occasion. The food was delicious and more than enough for each person. I mean u can't eat all of it coz it was a lot. But it was salty! Anyway... In Lachine area right by the water it's a perfect place to enjoy the Mexican restaurant. The ambiance was good and Mexican music it makes you more happy. The service was OK!! It seems that they were hire new waitress that they have to learn more and more!  In conclusion it's fine to go over there for once or twice a year. We will be back next year too ;)"}
{"text":"Well things didn't start off that well when we arrived with a reservation for 2, saw an empty table that stayed empty for 10 minutes while we stood waiting.  So I'm well aware the Montreal is far from the best place to get Mexican, and as such am rating this place in that context. I did like the decor and beer selection, but the food was not great. I ordered the fajitas and my friend ordered the chicken tacos. The chicken was quite tender, but it just lacked taste. My friend did like his tacos.  I doubt I'll be back here. There are several other Mexican joints I would prefer to try."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the positive reviews. I know Akron and the falls have horrible options when it comes to Mexican food, but this place seriously blows. I've eaten here twice and both my dude and I have gotten sick after each visit. Never again."}
{"text":"Wow! First of many visits to come, Im sure. Made reservations for six for Easter dins. We had a private room upstairs which in retrospect with our loud chatter and laughter was a stupendous idea. We decided on Tapas to start with everyone ordering something and sharing. My compliments to the chefs, as this food, every bit of it was perfectly cooked and beautifully arranged, which Im sure, was no easy task. There was charred octopus with paprika that absolutely melts in the mouth. If you have never had octopus or were never sure if you would like it, this is the place to try it. Calamari lightly breaded served with a citrus mayo was, again, so perfectly cooked and fresh that it literally falls apart in your mouth. There were escargot atop mushroom in tomato sauce with melted cheese that is do good you want to shovel them in. Also spicy garlic shrimp mixed with tomato that are inside of what look like toasted breaded ravioli, soo good. Gazpacho was also a circus of full flavours that left you wanting more and more. The mains were epic! Paella Valenciana, braised Lamb Shank, Paella Marisco, Bacalhau El Meson(salt cod was delicious), Roasted Tomato Crusted Rack of Lamb and Pollo Al Ajillo. We all tasted the dishes and it was a unanimous decision that the food was impeccably presented and absolutely delicious. Our server was there in the background with complete knowledge if his menu and wine list as well as a smile and some light hearted banter. Absolutely will be back and could not be a higher recommendation from me."}
{"text":"El Meson is a place you go when you want a cheap, and abnormally fast lunch. Don't expect anything amazing, just cheap \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"I go here quite often and the reason being 1.  Great Food 2.  Great Marguitas 3.  Fantastic Service 4.  Wonderful Prices 5.  Great Manager, Great Staff, they all work Very hard and they are nice and pleasant people.  You cant ask for more than this and I plan to continue to patronize El Meson !"}
{"text":"En un mot, décevant. Plats quelconques, service approximatif, ambiance inexistante. À éviter."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is so good...  My kids want to eat here every time I ask them where they want to go for dinner!    The decor is typical, as is the menu, but their food is better than any other Mexican place that is similar in price/selection."}
{"text":"The food is good and the menu has many choices. The chips are always fresh and the salsa is tasty. It is definitely old and the furniture is dated, but the prices are reasonable and the food tastes good.  Some of the servers are better than others. About half of the servers are very friendly and attentive. The other half seem indifferent and sometimes not friendly at all. We frequent this location but feel that when we return in the future we will request a specific server for a better overall experience."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot for a quick, tasty meal before football games at the nearby high school.  Key word is QUICK.  They always get the food out extremely fast.   If you're in a  hurry, you're in luck.  If you want a place to hang out and relax, this isn't the best.  The atmosphere is Early Mini-Mall and it's a little cramped.    That said, the food is excellent and so is the service.  We've been there many times and have never been disappointed in either.   Cheap too.  That must be why it's always busy, which I guess explains why they move people through so fast."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Wine selection is fine. Highly recommend for business and pleasure.  The servers are most attentive. The food has been consistently excellent for over 15 years. Large parking lot beside and plenty of parking nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Must try the margaritas! The food and staff make you feel like your down south."}
{"text":"Great little place, but my last visit gave me really bad food poisoning. The chimichanga was tasty, but it wasn't worth getting sick for."}
{"text":"No this is not a fancy place, no they don't have top notch wine and no they can't accommodate huge groups in winter (in summer they do have a terrace in back).   HOWEVER, this is one of the MOST AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurants. You can actually taste the \"home made\" flavours. Typical meals that you would find in Mexico.   Decor: crooked floors, colourful Mexican things hanging on the walls...PERFECT. It is so appropriate.  great cocktails and very nice staff. A+!"}
{"text":"This place is really close to my work. I go there a lot so I can tell you all that it has gotten much better. They've had a name change (maybe two) and they had a couple of great servers come and go. Overall, they're pretty good. The drinks tend to be better than average -- the food is basically on par with the other Mexican places in Cuyahoga Falls.   Tip -- if you have a group of six or more, you might want to ask for the back dining room. They don't send as many people back there (at least later in the evening) and you can laugh a little louder without making people mad."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town. Service is always quick, food is super delicious. Very cheap too. Staff is always kind"}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  I usually rate Mexican places by their beans and rice, and these were okay.  I was really impressed with their tamales.  It's the first place around here where I saw the corn husk imprints on the tamales.  The only bad things were the salsa with a salsa and chips was not good, and the chips were questionable.  But overall this place was above average.  Prices were good, beer was cold, I'd go there again. But I hope they fix the rickety booth. The chair is more like a recliner than a seat."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful sunny day so my daughter and I decided to walk down to the canal area in Lachine from her home and have a nice lunch.  We opted for El Meson because we both like Mexican food and I had never been there.  While waiting for our table inside, we sat on the porch and were served a nice pitcher of White Sangria and 2 glasses of plain water as requested.  Our server was friendly and prompt.  Once our  table was ready, we went inside and ordered our lunch.  We both ordered a cold Gazpacho to start and for the main course I had delicious Quesadilla with Red Snapper and my daughter a cold Shrimp Salad on Avocado.  Both meals were excellent and unfortunately we had no room left for dessert.  Maybe next time - as I will definitely go back another day.  They have a nice outside courtyard in the back,  where several other diners were enjoying their meals.  The washroom was tiny but immaculately clean."}
{"text":"This was once a must for us when in Lachine, and it's still adequate in most respects, but too many things have slipped in quality. At the same time prices have climbed above what we're used to from other similar restaurants. I don't think we'll be back.  Examples: on a visit today, my enchiladas tasted of chicken that had been stored in the fridge for too long after being cooked, while the green mole sauce had little flavour;; my partner asked for beans instead of rice, and received literally a tablespoon of beans.  On a previous visit, we ordered guacamole for the table, and it was presented attractively like a flower, with nacho chips as petals. But when we finished the chips, much of the guacamole remained, so we asked for more. The waitress told us no! She explained that the chips served on the plate were all we could have with that dish. We were astonished. On the positive side, although service is stretched and painfully slow, it can be very pleasant if you get the right server. Ours was embarrassed by the stingy bean serving, so he sneaked us an extra order of beans gratis. The other server where we're seated was also charming, checking on us a few times to see if we needed anything. Sadly, nice servers can't really make up for poor management."}
{"text":"Cutest little place located right across from the water. This restaurant has a very nice ambience to it. Nothing fancy just super authentic and colorful.  Customer service is the key to running a great business and this place sure has got it ! The food is okay a bit salty but I gave them 4 stars because they have amazing customer service. You'll truly feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Lend me your eyes for just a tick, while I inject your imagination with wonders of complete Hindenburg-esque failure and killer flame-eyed unicorns.  Because those visions have been in my dreams ever since visiting this lamentable establishment.  My soul mate and I happened upon this place over the weekend.  I recalled coming here over 10 years ago to her, regaling her mind with high hopes of fine pseudo-Mexican dining and drunken margarita fun time.  Unfortunately the equivalent of the destruction of Pompeii occurred over this time span, that of which El Meson unequivocally turned me into a lying fool right in front of the eyes and ears of my adorable sweetheart.  Suffice to say, she doesn't look at me the same again, and I have you to blame, El Meson.  Let's get down to brass tacks.  We ordered a pitcher of margarita, original flavor.  What evidently came to us was the ectoplasmic defecation of one Slimer from Ghostbusters.  It happened to be way too sweet and odd tasting for both of our tastes, but the alcohol was in there.  Slimer was indeed a good boozer, as I recall.  I ordered combo 18: chalupa, enchilada, chile relleno.  My baby ordered combo 31: chili relleno, chicken enchilada, beef burrito, rice and refried beans.  OK the food was bad, I'll just get to that point now.  Let's just say this place could give Taco Bell a run for it's money as far as the speed in which food comes out; it's almost like they had these plates already prepared before we even got there!!  I am well versed in quantum mechanics and parallel universes, and even I cannot explain this phenomenon!  Good luck to those that try though, I have a $25,000 bounty for this specific problem at Clay Mathematics Institute.    The chile relleno contained no chile peppers at all.  In fact, they may have just threw the stuffing in said \"stuffed pepper\" on the plate and called it a day!  The enchilada's were barely serviceable, and the chalupa was basically a flat corn tortilla with beans and old vegetables on top.  Definitely not even close to a traditional chalupa, and definitely not even close to a Taco Bell chalupa!  I'm sorry El Meson, your food innovation skills need refinement.  I will send you a picture of my derriere as an example of proper refinement, if you so desire.  The service at El Meson.....meh, I can't complain.  Our server spoke basic serviceable english, and he gave us everything we asked for, even though nearly all of it was a mistake on our part. Sometimes karma punches you in the face when you least expect it....yes I wholeheartedly regret wearing those buttless chaps to Sears the other day; THANK YOU world for a solid revenge on my conscience with El Meson!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  The Margaritas are fantastic.  The food is typical Mexican.  A great place for a quick meal and their salsa and chips are really good.  We always order a side of their melted white cheese with the chips and it is really quite good.  One thing i like is you can order grilled chicken in their dishes so you do not get overwhelmed with peppers and onion. One thing i can do without is that soccer is always playing on the TV. The service is amazingly quick and they give very nice portions. They also are listed on the Belly app.  They take competitors coupons as well.  Well worth the $$."}
{"text":"Great food, service and prices!! Family favorite of ours!! Clean place the too!! Love to support small local businesses!!"}
{"text":"A smaller place that sits on the water in Lachine. Colors pop off the wall and the small staff is very welcoming. The place oozes charm which really helps pack a punch in the ambiance. The food itself was flavorful and authentic. Although the prices are ever-little so higher than similar restaurants, there is always an uptick in prices in this area of town so it's actually a competitive price. Had a great time, with great company, will certainly have this place bookmarked."}
{"text":"Great and fresh salsa, decent food overall. Nothing that particularly stood out for me to come back though. The place could also do some work on the decor. Nevertheless, margarita was tasty, service was courteous, and we got large portion of food at reasonable price. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day, it was quite busy, but the food was very good. I would have liked to have known it was a set menu for that day, as it was more than we had expected- food and money-wise $68 each. We did have a nice time, but when I opened my leftovers the next day, it was someone else's leftover food... :S"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has a real love of mediocre tex mex food, so we figured we didn't have much to lose by trying this place. It also has good reviews on yelp so I thought this might be enjoyable. My bar for Tex mex is really low, because I view it the same way I would as an Asian buffet.  This place was bad. Really bad. The atmosphere is kind of gross. The seats were lumpy (they kind of hurt to sit on) and they sat us at a table that hadn't been bussed. The chips they started us off with were wicked stale. My boyfriend ordered a chile relleno on the side of his meal...and it didn't have a chile. Anywhere. It was literally ground beef and cheese on a plate. This was my biggest gripe, and I know this is petty, but I feel personally offended that a business would think its okay to serve something that is missing THE MAIN INGREDIENT. If you are out of the ingredients to make something, then just tell me. It would have been fine. I ordered the Special Texas, which came out completely missing the chile relleno that it was supposed to include. The quesadilla was pretty much 100% beans and the chimichanga was just okay.  The service was fine and the food came out fast, but beyond that there was nothing redeeming about this place. If you're considering trying this place, drive a few extra minutes and go to el campesino in stow."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place the other night, looking for a place to eat.  What a great find.    It is \"just\" a neighborhood Mexican restaurant, but it is a top notch one.  Staff was very friendly, the food was terrific, and the price was a bargain.    My wife had the veggie quesadilla, which she said was very good (could have used a few more mushrooms and a little less onion).  I had the Chorio Pollo (or something like that) - a great dish of chicken, chorizo, and all sorts of veggies.  And both were big enough to take home lots.  Add on a beer and a guac appetizer and it was only $26 - a steal.  They have a huge menu and I'll have to be back to try more of it."}
{"text":"We love this place! New to the Cuyahoga Falls area, and this is one of our favorite places to eat!  I would recommend amping up the guacamole a bit, but other than that, everything is delicious. Service is very fast and friendly, too! Recommend the Fajita Quesadilla or Taco Salad! Yum!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican in the area! Love the quesadillas and chips and salsa! Great service and great prices!"}
{"text":"Best place in town if you want Mexican food. Great service good value and a great manager that cares about the business!! Extensive menu!"}
{"text":"Two pitchers of sangria later, I approve.  Seriously though, this is clearly a family run joint where the father is in the kitchen and the children are working the front of house. That, plus food which was far more authentic than I expected (umm, cactus garnish?) makes for a small business that really deserves to be rated favorably. Was everything a home run? No, not really... but it was still better than every other Americanized Mexican joint I've been to in the States.   Whatever you are doing Restaurant El Meson, please don't stop. Merci."}
{"text":"Good food, real basic Mexican food, nothing that stood out to me, I have definitely had better! But it wasn't awful either. The place is a little cramped, they checked on us frequently! But, not in an annoying manor either which was nice. You get hot chips and salsa when you sit down. We didn't order any drinks but their margaritas looked good, but they didn't have a visible bar and they had a few liquor drinks so that was a little weird! Lol:)--didn't go in the bathrooms so I don't know if they were clean. I had carne asada and it was very average, but filled me up. Rice was good too! I really liked their tortillas that came with my meal lol I only received 3 so I was a little bummed about that. Overall, good service, average food, children friendly, and easy fast, filling lunch :)!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. My orders have always been correct. My servers and host have always been extremely kind and efficient. I was a little surprised to read that someone called this \"Americanized\" Mexican food. Maybe it depends what you order but that has never been my experience. My ex-spouse is literally from Mexico and he was pleased with his food. And he's very critical of Mexican food and difficult to please! He said it was authentic. I personally would trust a true Native Mexican's opinion over a \"foodie\" on Yelp. (No offense.) I really enjoy the food and the atmosphere, and I have zero complaints. Keep up the great service, El Meson!"}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic cuisine and ambiance to suit. We ate here on a Wednesday evening, service was a bit slow but the food was well worth it. Prices are a little steep, but given the difficulty in finding authentic Mexican virtually anywhere in Montreal, this was a definite compromise. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I go here about once a week.  Not the best Mexican food you'll ever have, but its good and consistent.  Service is usually excellent.  They are more than happy to make substitutions on dishes.  I've had just about everything on the menu and its all good.  The daily specials are so cheap I wonder how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Un autre restaurant mexicain à Montréal?! Non. Un des seuls vrai restaurant mexicain à Montréal. De l'extérieur, au dirait vraiment une \"mexi casa\" et à l'intérieur on si croirais au Mexique, nême avec la neige et la température froide on n'oublie presque qu'on est au Québec.  L'endroit comme tel n'est pas très grand, mais en Été, il y a une grosse terasse arrière et deux/trois tables à l'avant vu sur le fleuve. Les prix sont relativement raisonnables, sauf si vous êtes comme moi et ne l'êtes pas raisonnable. Mon coup de coeur est définitivement le \"ceviche\". C'est une grosse portion mais une bonne et très gouteuse portion. Le meilleur que j'ai mangé. J'ai essayé à peu près tout sur le menu, au fil des années, et je dois avouer que je n'ai jamais été déçu. Ce restaurant ma fait découvrir un interêt particulié pour le cactus. C'est très bon, autant en salade qu'en fondue, choix qu'ils offrent sur leur menu.   Le service n'est pas le plus rapide que j'ai eu(probablement dû au temps de préparation), par contre, les nachos gratuites et une bonne bière ou margarita aide à faire patienter.   En conclusion, si vous voulez un vrai restaurant purement mexicain, je vous le recommande. Par contre, je conseillerais de toujours reserver avant. L'endroit est petit et ce remplis très vite en soirée.  Gracias!"}
{"text":"Best place ever. Pretty cheap and Large quantities of food. Servers are very nice. Unlimited Chips and Salsa."}
{"text":"Fast serving time. Great salsa and great guacamole. The pricing isnt too bad. Waiter was nice but the cashier wasnt. Good food and a large variety makes this a good place to stop."}
{"text":"A great find!  Authentic Mexican cuisine, good service and nice decor. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Endroit sympathique et bien situé en bordure du canal Lachine. Une belle petite terrasse avec une vue sur l'eau et le couché de soleil.  Les employés sont sympathiques et offrent un service correct.  Je trouve que certains items sur le menu sont beaucoup trop cher pour la qualité du plat et des ingrédients. J'ai commandé une salade repas à 9.00$ qui n'était pas mauvaise mais faite avec des ingrédients très de base qui coûtent quasiment rien ( Tomate, laitue, fromage rapé ). J'ai également commandé un Gaspacho que j'ai trouvé incroyablement délicieux!  J'y retournerai très certainement mais je fais une croix sur les salades."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Mexican places to eat in Akron. Even with a dinner rush food comes out super fast and drinks are amazing. Returning customer for life."}
{"text":"I tried to dine at this restaurant the week before, but the line was standing room only, out the door at 6:30. My hunch was that that this must be a best kept secret. Saturday at 4:30 PM, I tried again. This restaurant was still busy, but I was seated immediately. Here is the best news: They have a Vegetarian section on their menu! That, to me, has some gravity. I selected a combo plate which included one cheese enchilada, rice and a bean burrito.  The salsa came first in a pitcher, and it had a good zip to it.  I ordered iced tea. Evidently, someone there made it a few weeks ago. I sent it back. She brought me a Pepsi, which was ice cold. All was forgiven. The meal was average. No real wow factor, but it was fine, just a tad soggy.  The service was very fast and the Server was working very hard and had a great command of her time and her tables. Loved seeing this. I have not seen a work ethic like this in a Server, in some time and really liked her energy. Overall, may go back for lunch. Footnote: The booth was worn out and lumpy. The interior of the restaurant needs a facelift."}
{"text":"The good is that it's fast and relatively cheap.  I also got quite a bit of ground beef in my enchilada and burrito.   The queso dip is good.  The negative is that it's just ok.  Other than the price and speed, there's really nothing too special about this place.  Try it if you're in the area but if you're not, you're not missing much."}
{"text":"Bon p'tit resto mexicain, le midi spécial entre 10$ à 13$, délicieux et pas cher. De plus, y'a une p'tite terrasse en avant avec vue sur le Lac St-Louis, sinon une plus grosse en arrière."}
{"text":"I've been coming here from time to time since at least 2004. Over the years have brought out-of-town friends here for dinner many times and always love it. Sitting on a prime location next to the historic Lachine Fur Trade and the Parc Rene Levesque and the Lachine waterfront, in Lachine's old village, you can't ask for a better outdoor location especially during the summer and during sunset.They also have a big terrasse out back.  I should stress this is NOT Mexican fast food. This is real Mexican home-grown food with probably the best Chicken Mole in Montreal, chicken in that amazing chocolate spicy sauce served with cactus, rice and refried beans. Their sangria and their tres leches cake (3 milks cake) is also amazing. It is a family run operation with traditional Mexican decoration everywhere.  When I came on Saturday night with a buddy,  all the surrounding tables were full and there was a happy hum to the place.  This isn't high-end dining but they must be doing something right for staying in business all these years."}
{"text":"I live nearby this gem of a restaurant. I fell in love with it on my first visit. They serve the typical Mexican fare. The servers are always smiling and pleasant. I usually order the vegetarian burrito, which is not even on the menu.  I'm making myself hungry just writing this review. Try this restaurant and you will see for yourself.  ;)"}
{"text":"Well, I went back to this restaurant over a year later, and let me tell you, things have changed (or my first experience was an anomaly).  The service was MUCH better, and the food was fantastic!  I again enjoyed the Gaspaccio, and then had the beef tenderloin.  The tasters prior to the meal were also very good.  Had I not experienced the poor quality from 2010, I would rate this restaurant 4/5.  Since I did, I'm raising my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.  If the next visit is as good, it will go up again!"}
{"text":"Nothing over the top spectacular but the food is solid. Good portions, massive variety, very tasty. The restaurant itself is a tad worn but overall acceptable. What really impresses here is the service. Waiters are friendly and the food arrives ridiculously fast. I've eaten here several times and the results are usually the same. Recommended."}
{"text":"Super fast service. Nothing fancy here....normal Mexican fare. Lots of menu options and always full when you leave."}
{"text":"Fast service and the standard,  tasty Mexican fare. Tasty salsa and delicious cheese dip, plus the usual suspects as far as enchiladas,  fajitas and burritos.   Margaritas are great if you go for the Gold or Top Shelf varieties.  The standard house margaritas are all sugar.   The staff is always very friendly and we enjoy each visit.   They also take coupons from ALL Mexican restaurants,  which is awesome."}
{"text":"The resto is a great spot: a stone's throw away from Rene Levesque parc in Lachine. So it's a nice spot for a break from biking if you're riding from downtown - especially w the family. The food is essentially Tex-mex and it's solid. Nice virgin pina coladas too (no alcohol for me when riding w my 10 year old! - but adult versions and beers are available too)."}
{"text":"Yummy salsa and a place my son and I have always enjoyed going to. The food is fast and delicious  love the rice and he always gets the steak tacos. Service has been wonderful and courteous any time we have eaten here.  Good menu with a lot of combination choices."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmy and super fast. Not sure how they pack all those people in but they do...and comfortably.  Must try...youll be addicted"}
