{"text":"Excellent!When I first tried,I was so surprised for this new ,clean,delicious noodle bar which with cutie logo.  Very kind service and quickly for serve the dishes.   The music is also nice with many style songs! Anyway,I love it!I would suggest Spicy Beef Rice Vermicelli Soup and Duck Rice Noodle, spring roll is great too! Omg, I love many of them.  Btw, it is now midnight in London, and I really want a hot happy noodle!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise to find northern Vietnamese style noodles in Toronto. A rare find and super delicious!  And NO MSG makes me feel so good.  I have tried several different kinds of noodles and they actually made different soup base for each one, unlike many pho places with very blend soup base filled with MSG.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to see a new eatery in the neighbor and so gave it a try. 

Service:

- quite friendly but the waitress did not understand english well, and she mixed up my order and gave me the wrong noodle. Instead of returning it, i said i would give it a try. 

- the restaurant was not too too busy and it took a good 20 minutes to get 2 bowls of noodles and soup was not even hot enough.

Food:

- sorry to say that, it was the worst pho I've ever had. The noodle was so soggy...and the soup smelled funny. 
- I ordered the special which was a bowl of noodle and a rice roll; they told me rice roll was sold out and suggested me to get the spring roll; sure, why not try it. The first bite of spring roll, was soaked with oil, not crispy at all and the worst part was the filling taste 'sour', means it had gone bad. I spitted it out right away. 

We did not finish the noodles and spring roll, and we left and went to St Louis to continue with our dinner.

Overall, a VERY bad experience."}
{"text":"A very different kind of pho but absolutely delicious.  I thought people only eats one kind of pho in Vietnam like how people think Japanese eat sushi everyday, but boy was I ever wrong.  Northern style Vietnamese noodles, nice and light!!  My favourite so far is the duck and bamboo shoot one and the shiitake, eggs and chicken one.  Too bad I live in Markham, otherwise I would go every other day!!  Kids love it there as well as the selection of juices is excellent!!"}
{"text":"A rare find. Great soup base. Large portion. A different kind of Vietnamese noodles. Must try the duck noodle soup, the crab noodle and the chicken noodle. They now have curry as well . Excellent selection of juices."}
{"text":"This family run restaurant is close to my condo and just too conveniently located for me not to give them a try. 

I came here for their lunch special - order Large bowl of noodles and you'll get a free smoothie (four flavour choices). 

The staff was very friendly, though the owner's son didn't know much about what's on their menu. They also don't have vietnamese coffee, which was a bummer. 

The noodles in my House Special pho was overcooked with no texture at all. Aside from soggy noodles, the beef was not rare when it came out - everything was cooked. The soup base was overflowing in MSG - i was so thirsty afterwards! The Almond Banana smoothie was pretty good though ~ 

Would I come back? Probably not. Unless I have a pho craving late at night, this place is open till 4AM - I might consider giving them another shot."}
{"text":"You must come here if only to ogle at the awesomely ridiculous logo of Happy Noodle, the snake with a pig's head on it.  But fun graphics asides, the pho was actually quite good. I got the fresh noodles, something that I haven't seen at many pho joints, and that makes a huge difference. The broth was also really good, with a meaty flavour but only lightly salted.  The bean sprouts, basil, and the fresh hot pepper for the pho were fresh and clean.  The portion wasn't as big as some other pho restaurants, but it was about average and enough for me to be full. Same for the amount of meat in the bowl - I felt like they skimped a bit on the meat when I first saw the bowl, but in the end I was full so couldn't really complain.

The restaurant was nice and clean, and there were a few items on the menu that were slightly different from most pho restaurants I've been to. They claim it's \"Hanoi style\", so maybe that's what makes the difference."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price. Ppl are nice. They let me park at the back of their store.

Food was really good. They really mean it when they say spicy. The virmicelli has a special kick to it. The soup bowls are also very well portioned."}
{"text":"Hmmmm... where do I begin?  Happy Noodle you say?  I'd say not very happy noodle; I said good day sir!!

So a new pho joint just opened up in the neighbourhood and pho is my thing!  I love my pho!  Let's get to the nitty gritty here, shall we?


The Good:

- Nice clean restaurant.  It's bright as well!

- Very friendly staff, super eager to serve you

- Very clean bathroom, but then again it just opened

- Even offered us mango shake sampler! nice touch


The NOOOOOOO~~~~~:

- Took around 30 mins to get our bowl of pho!  Bad kitchen Bad!!  Seriously pho shouldn't take that long.

- The noodles were extremely soggy like they were boiled for hours

- The noodles were all broken up like someone took a blender through them

So this is not what we're expecting, especially on Yonge St.  The rent is high and the restaurant business is very competitive!  

Suffice to say, we couldn't even eat our order because of the poor quality of it.  The manager completely understood and offered us his apologies, took care of the bill and asked us to comeback next time.  

Hmmm, I'd like to but we're surrounded by good eatery here ya know?  

All in all, I wish you the best in the future!  Hope it's a one time thing, pho shizzle my nizzle, get it?

Bob out for some good pho!"}
{"text":"We ordered the rare beef and beef balls pho and the beef fried rice. Both were excellent- amongst the best we've had. The prices are extremely reasonable. Service was prompt and food arrived quickly. Highly recommended for everybody, regardless of budget!"}
{"text":"We were planning to eat soup tofu next store but it was mobbed and we did not feel like waiting.  A group of teenage kids in line in back of us bailed too.  Both my party and they decided to go next door to this place.

We were quite pleasantly surprised.  Tiny, but nicely decorated little storefront in black and lime green.  Very nice service and we did not find them too slow, thoughn we were not in a hurry.  Excellent, well-flavoured pho and bun dishes and fresh rolls were great too.

We will return."}
{"text":"The taste and quality of the food here rivals Khao San Road. Yep, I said it. 
While this isn't a fine dining restaurant, the food is delicious. 
Happy Noodle is a Viet & Thai fusion restaurant, and it remains open every day till almost 4 am! Talk about convenience. I just wish this was located in my neighbourhood. 

When my friend raved about the joint, I was skeptical because it doesn't look very impressive from the outside.  Nevertheless, I decided to give it a chance. I had the Veggie Curry with rice, and he had the Veggie curry with Noodles in the curry. it was around $7 each. The curry was literally boiling when the waiter served it to us.   It was absolutely delicious and wholesome. Loved the tofu and veggies in it. 

Another highlight ont he menu is the Chrysanthemum tea. It's extremely refreshing, and it's something like 3 bucks. It's iced tea, with chrysanthemums in it! I thought it was really neat. The service here was also excellent. I have no complaints about this place, and would return in a jiffy."}
