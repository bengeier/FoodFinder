{"text":"The atmosphere is great. Service is good. I like the set up of the shop and the flow. Lots to look at while enjoying your meal or simply waiting for it. It's definitely an everyday lunch stop. Thanx for the good food."}
{"text":"Good sandwich shop. Boars Head!  Could improve the flow of ordering and seating but everyone is nice."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I haven't fully explored all of its offerings but for me it's a wonderful takeout establishment - get the chicken salad in a spinach wrap - and it has my favorite Boddington's pub ale in single cans in the refrigerator.  Lots of cheese, obviously.  Was thrilled that I could order a fruit juice-only sweetened pie from Troyers in Amish country for the holidays via Shisler's, especially since the Mustard Seed stopped carrying any selection. They can hook you up with dozens of other pies as well!  So glad I found this place right in my stomping grounds. PS for those GPS-ing it, whoever created this entry misspelled the name of the street - it's Cleveland-Massillon Road.  Can't tell how to fix that."}
{"text":"I love this place. The deli sandwiches are WONDERFUL, and its so much fun to shop for treats or wine in the adorable shop. This is a local gem for breakfast, lunch,  a quick cup of coffee or to pick up Appetizers and  drinks for your dinner party. So glad we live close by!"}
{"text":"I love cheese and this place satisfies my needs. The store resides in one of the prettiest parts of Copley and offers fresh sliced deli meat and cheese sandwiches. Very interesting wine and beer selection, much locally made. The employees could be a little more helpful, as everything here is foreign to me, but I can overlook that for what is offered and the homey decor."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Shisler's for over a year new and enjoy their sandwiches and deli selection for lunch. There is heavy traffic during lunch hours, as many people are taking out, so often the orders are incorrect.  The store have an interesting variety of snacks, candy, wine and Amish baked goods. I like that they have a sampling section for things like \"wasabi peanuts\" and \"trail mix.\"   My company always orders our coprorate Christmas gifts from there for our clients, and they always turn out wonderfully. We also ordered a beautiful gift basket for a silent auction that was filled with delicious goodies and was presented and wrapped beautifully.  One of the best parts about Shisler's is the Ben Heggy's candy selection. Be sure to call ahead to ask if the milk chocolate covered peanuts are in stock - it is their most popular candy item and they are often out of them.  The service is average; the employees are nice enough, but often seem distracted and superior customer service is not one of their priorities.  I would give Shisler's in Copley between 3 and 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I am fortunate to live just a couple of blocks away from this amazing store.  I love everything about it, especially their chicken salad sandwiches (which I have along with a cold root beer).   I love sitting on their patio at lunchtime (but I don't go at noon because many people from the businesses close by are there then) and I also love sitting inside when the weather is not very good.    I love the decor, the comfortable feel of the place, their wine selections (they have wine tastings once a month) and even the selection of specialty beers.  And then, of course, there is the selection of cheeses.  In the wintertime I make lots of grilled cheese sandwiches, and staff have all been very helpful in making suggestions of what cheeses to try. In fact, I have found all staff very helpful and pleasant and have never been treated rudely.  If you are looking for a unique and comfortable place to shop or to have lunch, I highly recommend Shisler's Cheese House."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and wine.  Quiet and quaint atmosphere to enjoy some lunch. The shop has lots to choose from as well!"}
{"text":"Deli, wine and snacks in one of the coolest places in the Montrose area. Food is really good,, high quality. Unique snacks and gift ideas."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. It comes as a surprise to me that the clientele of Copley can sustain a specialty cheese store, but the quality of the cheeses here is nearly unsurpassed for Northeast Ohio. Also, as a local resident, I often find myself here on the weekends for lunch as their deli sandwiches are high quality alternatives to subway."}
{"text":"Foodies rejoice! Though I despise that term, if you're looking for beer, wine or cheese in Summit County, then I urge you to get off the beaten path and cruise on over to Shisler's. The staff here is extremely helpful and friendly. This is a fine example of what a mom and pop operation should look like. The only problem is that unless somebody tells you about this place, you'll likely never see it. The selection of specialty items in this store is nearly overwhelming."}
{"text":"I have only had the occasional sandwich there, but it was good. I rated this a 5 because I love there cheese and cracker/snack selection and the staff is amazingly helpful and nice. Very awesome local business, great with gift baskets and helping you taste and pick a new favorite cheese! Plus they always give my daughter a pretzel whenever we check out lol"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, place is clean, and the workers are very friendly.  Great selection of Boars Head deli meats and cheeses.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Great place for soup and sandwiches! Grabbing a great bottle of wine here is also a huge plus- not to mention the variety of delicious cheese!"}
{"text":"The cutest little cheese shop. They have boars head deli meat and amazing cheeses. So many different types of wine to pick from. You can dine in or carry out. And a plethora of crackers, chips, candy, coffee and exotic oils and cheese spreads. I love this place. $-$$ and they do gift baskets too!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! My fianc√© and I stopped here to pick up picnic food before going to see Shakespeare at Stan Hywet. What a wonderful store! Great selection of crackers, chocolates, spreads, wine, Amish cheeses, and sandwiches! All employees were very kind and helpful! Also, be sure to check out the ice cream store next door, delicious!!"}
{"text":"Shisler is a nice little country style store. They have a good selection of cheeses and wines and some misc chocolates and snacks.  Everyone there is friendly, smiling, and helpful. Make sure you get a sandwich while you are there.   To start off, ordering was simple after you decide which sandwich you would like. :)   Even better all the specialty sandwiches are only $6.99!  I chose the Italian and got it hot (meaning buttered and pressed like a cubano). The meats were delicious and the cheese and peppers complimented it well. Good texture on the bread and the \"amish\" butter used on it makes a difference for sure. Definitely recommend it.  We also ordered the Reuben.  The rye bread was really good and cooked to a nice crispness that added that crunch factor and texture.  The meat was good and the sauerkraut and cheese made it a really tasty sandwich altogether. Thumbs up on this one too!  The chicken salad sandwich was really good. Definitely above average. If you like chicken salad, then you want this.  We also got the pasta salad and stuffed cherry peppers (w/ prosciutto and provolone) from the deli area. Pasta salad was tasty and went well with the sandwiches and the peppers were nice as an appetizer. Had a little bite to it and the meat and cheese had a good contrasting flavor to it. Would buy and eat it again!  If you like pasta salad get it. If you like stuffed peppers or olive type things get the cherry peppers (was different and a nice surprise).   Overall, Shislers is the kind of store I can go to in my area, but the friendliness and price of things is awesome.   If you are in the Akron area for anything, head here and have a good lunch and pick up some wine and cheese for later on and some chocolates!"}
{"text":"I've stopped by several times to order lunch. Word of warning is, be prepared for a long wait if you happen to stop around noon. I ordered a club sandwich and waited 25 minutes to get it.  Great food, just too long to get it."}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here for a sandwich and a glass of wine.  It beats the hustle and bustle of fast food in Fairlawn!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 8 years. I passed by on my way to work and decided to try it one day. Took my sandwich and a menu back to work. Everyone came up and asked me where I got my lunch from because it looked so good. I made copies of the menu and everyone at work started ordering from Shislers. If you call ahead and order they always have it ready but expect a little longer for them to get it ready if close to noon.  Good quality meats and cheeses. Sides are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch,  every time I am in the area I stop by Shislers.  I have only tried a few of their deli sandwiches but what I have had has been good. Their coffee and cheese is excellent, definitely worth a visit for them alone.  They also have some good & unique snack food.  There is usually a long wait if stopping in for lunch, they do have call ahead orders though which really helps out if you are in a hurry.  My only complaint is I wish they were open a bit later,"}
{"text":"My sandwich was made totally wrong the first time around. Second time it was as ordered, but extremely middle of the road.  I cannot figure out what the rave reviews of this place are. $2 for a bottled tea, $1.29 for small bag of chips, and the other \"sides\" were way overpriced as well.   Customer service left something to be desired. The woman who made the order wrong the first time (yes, I saw the ticket and it was marked correctly, she just didn't have the wherewithal to bother looking at it) acted like I was trying to scam her and really put her out by pointing out the sandwich was incorrectly made. Even though my girl and I were the only ones in the place. All but threw the replacement sandwich at us.  If you're in the middle of nowhere and have some extra cash to put the grumble in your belly asleep, there are worse places you can go. But the other national chain \"sandwich\" shop just south of here will make yours to order right there on the spot, usually for a little cheaper."}
{"text":"Love their side salad with chicken salad.  I have to eat gluten free but my husband loves Shisler's sandwiches and has a difficult time stopping when he's full.  We love the outdoor patio.  The cheeses are excellent too."}
