{"text":"Fantastic Italian for amazing value. Had angel hair with tomato cream sauce, julien vegetables, italian sausage and calamari.  Pasta was fresh and sauce was wonderful. Located in the back parking lot, very non-discrete. Take out or delivery only. Great service too - the Italian owner obviously puts a lot of care into his food. Tiramisu was OMFG delicious."}
{"text":"The pizza is bigger than the box !! The pasta is clearly cooked with love ! Always delivered piping hot by the friendliest fellows around! My family is addicted !"}
{"text":"What to eat while I'm staying late at work? Check orderit.ca and this place comes up for Italian.  And it was delicious!  I ordered the Veal Marsala, crimini mushrooms in a wine sauce over top two/three large pieces of veal. It was delicious! The seasonal veggies and potatoes, goes great.  I also looked around at some other orders, the risotto looks enough for at least two full meals.  What I also like is if you needed catering, their stuff comes family style too so you could order a whole tray!  Definitely will order again from here."}
{"text":"I ordered from Simpatico Ciboevino from Just-Eat.ca.   I ordered a 12\" pizza, a single creamy sauce fettuccine, and an order of garlic bread with cheese. It came to $36 including tax and delivery ($2). It took the full 45 minutes to get here.   When I opened the box it looked like I ordered a plain cheese pizza. No other toppings were visible. Then I later realized they were there just really small and sparse. They definitely skimped on toppings, or maybe that's just how they do it.  The pizza was ok. The pasta was also ok. The garlic bread was good.  Their ingredients are cheap. You can taste the cheapness in the parmesan cheese, toppings and sauces. Even though it wasn't too expensive considering I got pizza, pasta and garlic bread, I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"The smell of cheese on the thin crust pizza will intoxicate you. You know what else is intoxicating? The reasonable price you pay for a 12\" pizza.  It's one of those rare win-win situations between your stomach and your wallet..."}
