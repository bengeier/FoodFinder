{"text":"My friend and I went to lunch here yesterday for the first time. We had a great experience. The man who waited on us was super friendly and was very helpful in our deciding what to order. We split the Hummus & Chicken Shawarma Plate and the Greek Salad. Both were delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fresh food that is really tasty!! If your looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant look no further!"}
{"text":"Food is legit with a large selection and their Moroccan tea is bomb. Small place though if you want to stay and eat it's very close quarters. But overall one of my favorites in surprise."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Mediterranean food and this place is really authentic! I stopped for a quick bite  and ordered their beef gyro combo. Not only it was super cheap $7.99 but it was filling. I liked that the meat was not salty. The gyro sauce very light but flavorful. They cooked everything while I was waiting and everything tastes fresh, warm and the French fries extra crispy! I will come back! The service was good. All the staff are very welcoming. I can't wait to try their Falafels and Domas. I left wanting more and I will highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Food is amazing.  Staff is authetic, warm and inviting.  We have been to the middle east 4 times and it is refreshing to have a place in the north west valley that serves up good food and reminds us of our trips there.  Keep up the good work and we hope you are around for a long time."}
{"text":"Had a taste for Mediterranean food, thought we'd give this place a shot. Plenty of parking, clean enough, with a traditional Mediterranean menu. Self serve beverages. 
Honestly, the food was tasty, the wait was a bit long. 
Not sure if the A/C was broken, or not working quite right, but it was warm in there.  Didn't make for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened, if management changed or what, the menu has changed and the food wasn't as fresh as before. Eating soup in a plastic tub is not what I wanted. It's to bad they couldn't keep up. 

Looks like the world is back in order. The management contacted me via yelp and explained that there was an injury with his wife the main chef, and that everything is back in order. Glad I came back. Good food good atmosphere. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Living in AZ almost 20 months this is the best mediterranean food we have tried.  I had the chicken shawarma and substituted the French fries with Hummus.  My husband had #12 Gyro plate. We both thought the food was great and we will definitely be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is AMAZING! They are so friendly and so clean!! The hummus is homemade and can't be any better! I got the chicken shawarma and hummus plate and I was really impressed with how fresh and delicious t was. Will recommend this place to everyone!!!! The Tea turned into iced tea.....so good!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for my birthday dinner and upon walking in the door we were treated as family. Portions were generous and delicious! We left feeling full and happy. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to see a Mediterranean Restaurant that we almost let the food cooking at home burn just so we could eat there. But we're not made of money so a few days passed and we returned tonight.

This was a good idea. We shared the vegetarian sampler and the meat sampler between the three of us. We then took home three gyros to the family that stayed behind.

The food feels fresh and it is very flavorful. The prices are quite budget friendly.  Staff is engaging and attentive. My husband really liked the Moroccan Hot Sweet Tea over ice. I know, I know.

So we wiill be back! Looking forward to watching them grow. Hope they will have some good desserts."}
{"text":"We were over visiting from Newport Beach, CA and read the reviews on Yelp.  There is a reason this restaurant is highly rated.  The food is excellent and the hospitality offered by Mustafa, the owner of this establishment, was as if he had invited us to his home.  This is a rarity to be served, what is basically home cooked food, in a sit down casual restaurant.  We had soup, gyros, and baba ghanoush, all spectacular.  This is truly a family owned restaurant where you are treated like family.

Can't speak highly enough about this experience.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant this past weekend and the food was outstanding.  I had the meat sampler and it was a win.  Also tried the hummus and it was the best I have ever eaten.  The staff was very friendly and I will eat here again in the near future."}
{"text":"What a delicious lunch!  Went to lunch on a Friday.  Ordered the gyro plate.  Came with gyro meat, pita bread, hummus and rice.  So, so good!
Restaurant was clean.  Staff accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here for lunch. Delicious authentic food. 
Both the gyro and falafel were fantastic. Little touches like finely chopping the cucumber and onion with the spices puts these sandwiches above most. You can tell the owners put a lot of love into their food. And they couldn't have been nicer. 
Just a nice, yummy lunch that makes me want to return soon. 
It's set back a bit in the shopping center it's in, but don't give up looking for it... You'll thank yourself."}
{"text":"This is now one of our to go to places in Surprise. We love the family atmosphere and the food is amazing! We have tried many dishes all of them have been delicious but my favorite is the hummus and chicken shawarma. The hummus is so fresh and it has the best flavor. We also love how nice the family is when you walk in they make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh. We will be back for sure. A nice change from all the Mexican and Italian food around here"}
{"text":"I enjoyed many of the items that were part of the beef Gyros plate. I was disappointed that a lot of the meat was more crumble then nice pieces. There's certainly some tasty items on the menu. I tasted several items off my wife's vegetarian plate and they were good. Overall the disappointment in the beef Gyros  meat knock their score down. Like the idea that it is a family attempting to make a go of it in the tough restaurant business"}
{"text":"This place was great and the food was awesome. I will definitely return, in fact I promised my girlfriend I would take her."}
{"text":"So absolutely bummed! Drove 20 minutes out of my way to find this place is closed from 1/13-1/29....now where? It's so hard to find good food close to my daughters house in Waddell."}
{"text":"We have been to Paradise restaurant 3 times over a couple months. Great food every time. Pleasant and gracious employees happy to see us when we walk in the door. Chicken kabobs, hummus, ganoush, stuffed grape leaves, tabouleh, falafels, and pita bread (shared a veggie platter plus a side of kabobs). After tip, 25 dollars for the two of us, with leftovers to take home. We will definitely come back. It is a few doors away from the Sprouts market, to the west I think. Try it for something a little different, yet still with a bit of familiarity. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Im so thankful to have a great Mediterranean restaurant in surprise! My husband and i tried beef and chicken gyros, greek salad and hummus...all so tasty. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family. I will be a definite regular! Yum!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ordered the Gyro and vegetarian plates. We were pleasantly surprised! The gyro meat was perfect and the falafels were tasty! The staff was incredibly friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ive only been here for lunch. For something beyond a Gyro you can't go wrong with the family run place."}
{"text":"First time going here. Had the chicken kabob! Very good! Usually I am very picky with hummus, but this tasted very good. Not pricey either. Place was very clean. And the employees were super friendly"}
{"text":"I was working close by to the restaurant and wanted to eat some middle eastern food. I saw this place with 4.5 starts I thought it would taste really good. I ordered meat sampler to try all the meats they make. The food didn't taste anything good and I ended up getting sick. It seemed like a good family owned restaurant but the food wasn't prepared in a healthy/clean environment. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"This family is so nice and the food is always fresh, hot and super tasty. By far the best Mediterranean in Surprise. The customer service and gyros have me coming back every week!"}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing flavor to the West Valley.  Not only is the food delicious and the Moroccan tea,  the best tea I have had in a long time, but the owners are gracious and hospitable.  The prices are also the most reasonable I have seen since moving into the Valley 8yrs ago.  I love this place and the owners are absolutely the kindest!"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything on this menu.  Ohhhhh emm geeee! Best gyro and so full of meat.   The hummus is to die for.  Great fresh pitas!  The meat sampler was awesome!   And the falafel platter is great too!  We love this place and have gone for takeout multiple times.   You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place after reading the great reviews on Yelp. I wanted to order the vegetarian dish but wasn't familiar with most of the items on the plate. The owner Mustafa and his family patiently explained everything and told me what ingredients they used in the various dishes. They were extremely nice and welcoming. Recently I've adopted healthier eating habits instead of eating fast food like I normally do so I'm trying different places to eat. When the food arrived, it was delicious! Everything was bursting with flavor and you could taste the freshness of the ingredients. I kept saying \"mmmmm\" with every bite and my husband sat there laughing at me. This is now my new favorite place:)"}
{"text":"We had take out and loved it.  It's nice to have a good Greek option close by finally.  I also like that's it's family owned and operated. 


9/7/17 update:  They changed their menu and took away all the unique Greek options I had enjoyed previously."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome service. Highly recommended!! The lentil soup and gyro are great."}
{"text":"The good is made to order.  Everything that my boyfriend and I had was very good. Staff was friendly and accommodating and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Food is legitimately delicious. Rice with saffron was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Beef was mildly flavored and blended perfectly with the tzatziki sauce. 
Chicken was slightly tough, but tasty and humus was creamy good. Could use a little more lemon juice. A little on the pricy side. However, with the kindness and service and being super accommodating, I will gladly pay for this luxury.
Excellent! You should give it a try."}
{"text":"Up the street from work, so  I hit them up for take out.  It usually takes at least 15 to 20 minutes to get your food. Usually order the Gyros they are big and tasty and worth every penny of it. I have ordered the combo app. It was very good as well. However on my last take out order, I order hummus and pita as an app. They put the hummus in a container, never gave me the bread. I called as soon as I got to work and realized it was missing. I was told to come back and get it. Well that's nice , if you want all your food to be cold. I was running short on lunch because how long the order took. Finally ,the manager  agreed to give me a new order the next time I am in. And all of that took another 5 to 7 minutes of my lunch. No apology for the inconvenience  . Haven't been back ."}
{"text":"The BEST Hummus in Surprise! Got the shawarma chicken-it was delicious. The owners are so warm and welcoming too. You feel like your having dinner and your favorite aunt and uncles home."}
{"text":"My dreams came true, finally a good gyro in Surprise. Very yummy beef gyros and a huuuuge portion. I've gone to lots of gyro places and this was probably the biggest portion for the price. It also looks like they are adding to their menu. Only complaint is they didn't seem to have drink cups to go."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly people! For the price you get a lot of food. The falafel was delicious and a great option for vegetarians."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I was impressed. It is really great food. I ordered the Hummus and beef gyro (#20) and and order of rice, and it was amazing! Also the staff were so nice and friendly. This was a good find, and I will come back again."}
{"text":"What a find! Just a small family place with most amazing food. I've just about run the menu, and have not had anything even mediocre. Lightest falafel on the planet. Home made hummus to die for. Don't expect much atmosphere, but a friendly family running the place more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"They have closed for good, sold the business, save the trip.  Don't know if new owner will open soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a new restaurant to try. Paradise Mediterranean Grill got good reviews so we thought we would try it out. When we first arrived I thought maybe we had come to the wrong place - it looks like a diner, and the reviews of the food did not shout \"diner\". We decided to give it a try. My husband ordered the meat sampler platter and I ordered a Greek salad with shawarma chicken on top; we shared a small hummus. This food is definitely NOT diner food. The hummus was light and delicious and the pita bread was soft and warm. Paradise Mediterranean Grill did not disappoint!  We will definitely be back!

The only con to our visit was that the prices were a little high, but that was neutralized by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Loved their humus and salad. Very nice staff. A little smaller eating area inside, but over all, it works. This will definitely be a regular lunch spot for me . I can't wait to try all of the other dishes."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was well worth the wait. Yes it was a longer wait than I had hoped for, but that might have been because I was hungry. 
I had the chicken kabob and my husband had falafel.  We were not disappointed. The hummus was flavored nicely. We will definitely be back, but might call ahead to avoid the wait. The family that runs it was very nice and made suggestions based on what we were looking for.,"}
{"text":"My daughter's LOVE this place- and you know if kids ask for Paradise Mediterranean Grill- it's gotta be delicious!! The entire staff is so nice- and their food is amazing! We love the chicken shawarma and chicken kabobs... And the hummus is fantastic! Must try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service!! Very clean, and we probably waited about 20 min for the food to come out, which makes me happy, because it indicates that they're truly COOKING your food and not just microwaving like many restaurants do. Will be frequenting this place!
(It should be noted that I am very picky about food quality and cleanliness of where I eat!)"}
{"text":"Hummus was the best!  Ordered a variety of food and everything was fabulous!
Staff was very friendly  SUPPORT LOCAL SURPRISE!"}
{"text":"So this was my second visit and I decided to dine in. My experience was excellent. The food in my opinion flavoring wise leans more towards the Middle Eastern versus Greek style which I absolutely love. Everything tasted fresh with family recipes and just perfectly prepared. The staff is very nice and helpful. I live in Tempe and visit family in surprise or else I'd be in everyday. Thank you and I really respect the integrity behind what you're doing."}
{"text":"Service is top tier here! Greeted with warm welcome from owner and all staff. Smiles abound. Ordered a combo plate with chicken, rice, and hummus. Fresh tasting and great quality food was encountered and greatly liked. To top it off, was reasonably priced and worthy of future visits."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!  So happy to have a quality Mediterranean restaurant in Surprise! The owners were so friendly and gave awesome customer service!!  My only recommendation is that they add pita slices w/ salad orders!  Other than that my family and I devoured our delicious food....we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner is one of the most courteous people I've ever came across in a restaurant. Gyro was huge and delicious. Fries were excellent and crispy. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food in Surprise. Fresh, flavorful and substantial portions. Also beautiful presentation. Both the gyro beef and chicken shawarma were delicious as was the hummus. Pitas excellent. You can tell that the owner cares about quality and service. Server was helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"Found this little gem before we went grocery shopping and my husband was craving Mediterranean food so we decided to go and try it. WOW WOW WOW! Their food was incredible and full of flavor, everything was clean and the people were so incredibly nice and welcoming. It felt like I was in my grandmothers kitchen :) They make the tzaiki sauce in house and its so good! I will definitely be going back to this  place"}
{"text":"Wow!The food here is delicious. Gyros are delicious .Grape leaves homemade & awesome. Restaurant is immaculate,bathrooms immaculate! Can't  wait to go back,staff is great !"}
{"text":"Delicious food and restaurant is very clean.  Staff friendly and accommodating. Doesn't get any better, and looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Had a craving for mediterrean food and this place is just down the road from me.. This was my first visit and I decided on the chicken shawarma wrap and some dolmades. I was not disappointed. The chicken was perfectly flavored and served in nice sized strips. I'll definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is great and the staff is friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food on our second visit was as good as the first.  This is the 4th restaurant in this spot.  Hope this one makes it.  My husband loved the rice and I thought the falafels were much better than the ones at the other Mediterranean restaurant in this area.  This will be our go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. Ingredients are fresh.. they did change the menu though.. I ordered chicken gyro bowl.. It's not good at all.  Doesn't even look like chicken or gyro.. however the beef gyro or lamb gyro is really really good. Love the sauce. Please remove the chicken gyro from the menu..."}
{"text":"Lunch was really wonderful!  Food was very fresh and hot.  Authentic Mediterranean food that was wonderfully spiced. We were planning what to order the next time we came in, while we were still eating."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Family that owns/runs are very friendly! Good to have something new in Surprise! Highly recommend the chicken kabob and the grape leaves."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the prices are very reasonable and the family that owns and runs this place friendly and welcoming. Good new addition to surprise definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm Greek and I know good Greek food! Had the chicken kabob pita which was moist and flavorful! I am impressed. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great middle eastern food in a casual atmosphere.
Family owned and operated. Mustafa is a wonderful host offering hospitality and perfect fully prepared food. 
Don't miss this Surprise treasure.
RB"}
{"text":"Showed up at 7:05 pm on Sunday, 3/12.  Sign says open until 8:00 pm.  Doors locked, nobody inside.  FYI - AZ Doesn't observe daylight savings time."}
{"text":"I eat here every chance I get for lunch or after work there food is amazing and the customer service is 5 stars. I try to come here and order some new every time I eat here and everything I have tried was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The staff were very polite and friendly. They greeted us upon entering and answered any questions we had with a smile. It was clean and quiet. And the food tasted very fresh and authentic. They were out of dolmades when I went, which made me sad, but that's ok. The gyro was so good. It is obviously a locally owned business and I support them over any chain so I'm happy to continue my patronage!"}
{"text":"Had limited menu for awhile when cook was ill.  Now a gem again.

Great food.  Reasonable prices.  Love the Meat Sampler and grape leaves.

CLOSED!"}
{"text":"I had had a very good Greek Salad for lunch. They have so much more great dishes with chicken, hummus etc. If you like Mediterranean food this is the right lunch place to go to."}
{"text":"To begin with the owners are so friendly and nice.  We really enjoyed the warm greeting we were given.  My husband and I both ordered the gyro combo.  We watched as the meat was piled high on the delicious pita. The gyro was outstanding as were the fries.  Hurry on and try this new restaurant out.  You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is a small family owned place. Food is very good and they're so friendly! I loved the gyro meat and couldn't get enough of it. They even had dolmades which is difficult to do right! Definitely a must visit if you're in the Surprise area!"}
{"text":"Delicious gyro + fries served w/ friendly service & a smile :) Lots of meat & a good price too! The combo comes with a super big fountain drink! what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My husband and I really enjoyed the food and friendly atmosphere.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food with excellent variety.  Very friendly owners and server.  Clean and bright interior.  So good we are returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I had the Greek salad with shawarma and pita bread. Best I have had in a long time. So happy to have found this gem in Surprise."}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything but the gyro but I'd was fantastic!  The bread was so soft and smelled so fresh, but the meat was flavorful and tender, shaved in small 'shavings' so it was like eating a little cloud 
Their tzatziki sauce is super nummy!!  Great people - friendly and caring.  My new fav lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Very yummy! Stopped by this weekend and picked up a gyro combo for my SO and a chicken shawarma plate for myself. I was a little disappointed when I got home to see that they don't include a pita with the plates - you have to tell them to add it as a 'side' or pay an extra $.99 (that I would have paid had I known it wasn't included). Nevertheless, the food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must if your craving fresh and delicious food.  The owners are so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"O m g!! The food here is terrific! Please ignore all the idiots posting poor reviews. We came on a Tuesday eve and it was quiet. Our order was cooked fresh and was so good. I had a chicken schwarma combo, the fries were super fresh, and the chicken outstanding! Tender, juicy marinade flavored all the way through. Pickles, onions tahini sauce, the seasonings were bold and just right. My hubs beef shaved meat gyro thing was the best I think I've ever had yet in Arizona. Very much like the Donar gyro I had once in Truro, Canada, but better. The tzaziki sauce was the bomb. The entire family was welcoming, attentive and sincere. The young man at the register was great, someone was complaining about him but I think he was quite nice. The only improvement would be if they could serve wine or beer! Most definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love eating here! The food is amazing and everyone always has a smile on their face. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I 100% recommend everything on the menu including the baklava! It's refreshing to eat food made from scratch and to enjoy an authentic Mediterranean meal."}
{"text":"The place was not busy at all when I first arrived, which could be good and bad. The service was delightful and welcoming. I ordered the gyro, of course, and it was delicious. The pita was one of the freshest I've ever had and their tzatiki, with onion and cucumber, was like none I've tasted before, it complimented the beef, which they cut directly from a spit it spins on-yum! It's not fast food as they prepare each order as it comes in and just an update from what I observed when I arrived, at noon more and more customers arrived creating a line. 

All in all, the place was clean, the staff friendly and the gyro good. I love that it's not fast food, but food prepared when ordered, and at a reasonable price(combo cost me in total $8.75). It's obvious to me they enjoy what they are serving and each other, as I believe it's family owned and operated. It's refreshing having Mediterranean food as an option in Surprise, where all they do is Mediterranean. I would recommend coming here and trying them out."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a shot based off the reviews.  I was disappointed overall. The staff was friendly, the food was not that great.   Chicken was dry.  Flavor was ok. I've had better. For the price it wasn't worth it.  There are better Greek and Mediterranean food places in the same area that I would choose first."}
{"text":"My rating is more about the service than the food.  We were there on a Saturday and there were  only a few people in the restaurant.  We still waited over 20 minutes for our food.  The people working there were very nice but that kind of wait for essentially fast food is just crazy.    I thought the Gyro was good with a generous portion of meat, and the fries were fresh and crisp.  My husband had the chicken shawarma though and he did enjoy his food and only ate a few bites."}
{"text":"I'm incredibly happy this place opened. My husband is Lebanese so it's always tough to find good food that satisfies him missing his Tati. We found a good one.

The place is comfortable, clean, and well-lit. They just opened last week so it's somewhat bare but the essentials are there. The bathroom was clean too (an often overlooked detail in reviews!) The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We ate with my parents and 2 kids and there was plenty of room. Booths would be nice, but not a deal killer for us. They only had tables and chairs. 

Now the good stuff. We had the chicken hummus, chicken schwarma, beef Gyro combo, kabobs, baba ganoush, and their hot Moroccan sweet tea. Ohmahgersh. DELICIOUS. Every bite of it. With our schwarma and Gyro, you get fries. That was the only part I didn't eat. They were undercooked but who the hell cares because that hummus and chicken. The pita was soft and perfect consistency for the hummus. The tatziki was great too. If you do come here, do yourself a favor and get a cup of the hot tea. Perfect for a cozy winter night. 

There is only one other place that compares and that's the Greek place on 16th st near the I10. I'm a Local First localist so I'm beyond thrilled this place is within walking distance from home. Remember folks, for every $100 bucks you spend, when you spend it locally, $47 stays in Arizona and when you spend on chains, only $7 stays in AZ. We have to build up our local economy and keep our communities growing! Needless to say, I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! We've been here twice within the last 2 weeks && for good reasons, if I could come here every day I totally would! They have the best chicken kabobs, everything here taste amazing! The staff is so friendly it has a \"family\" feel to it! 
I've been waiting for a good Mediterranean place, this is definitely that! If I could give it more stars I totally would!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma. It was delicious, very flavorful! The fries were crispy just like I like :) The folks behind the counter were super friendly and the whole thing cost less than I would spend at Subway. I can't wait to try everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Staff very great .food okay. Ruben sandwich the meat was really really tuff.the gyro platter was alot of food but I wish meat was better sliced mostly received crumbs of meat and chicken rice soup was bland too much rice in it and it needed more chicken broth and more flavor"}
{"text":"1st here, ordered ftg. got the falafel plate.... everything was so delish! the falafel was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. the rice was tender and flavorful. the grape leaves are not loaded down with olive oil, which I really liked, and were very good. can't beat 9.99 for all you receive. The restaurant is very clean. The decor and the way the tables are situated are perfect for casual dining. Very friendly and quick service. Very happy to have this restaurant in Surprise! Will tell everyone I know to try it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stop in to have lunch when I am getting my car washed or shopping at Sprout's.  Good food and good value.  I like the tastes of the Mediterranean and they do a very nice job.  Food is well spiced and priced.  Very friendly family that runs this little eatery.  Ten times better than any burger joint around.  When I eat there I am in Paradise."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this restaurant has opened because it's a real middle eastern food that's served and its delicious. I recommend the food very highly, serves is awesome and the owner is an amazing man with his family. Please go try it you will be very happy."}
{"text":"I will be going back on a regular basis. The food was great the place was clean and the owner and family are very warm and wonderful host ."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restraunt we have here in Surprise . Delicious meal ,generiously portioned. Prices were more than fair . Family run with a great atmosphere. Very happy to support them and am over joyed to have found it !"}
{"text":"First time here, walked in very quiet the staff was friendly. We ordered our food it was cooked fresh, I got the Greek salad and a gyro sandwich the flavors were delicious, third puts bread had a nice grilled taste the meat was delicious. It seemed like it was family owned I loved it here and i will be back"}
{"text":"Since my move from Chicago, I've been searching for a good Mediterranean restaurant. Went with my hubby in around lunch time,  ordered the chicken shawerma plate with the kufta kabab plate. The food took a little while, but it was worth the wait. The chicken shawerma is a must! The portion size was big, with rice, humus and pita bread.  Took the left over for later. The staff was friendly and nice. A bit pricey but I guess for the portion size it was ok. I might do the sandwiches instead next time. The bathroom was clean.  Overall I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The wife order a meal and got totally different then she ordered . and then for the kids it took 30 mins for a Pita pizza. Really"}
{"text":"Went there for Greek salad.  Had to add Gyro meat to get it the way I liked it.  We had pita bread and hummus to start, which is delicious!  The salads are fresh and tasty, the staff is very gracious.  The pricing is great, love the food will go back soon."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting food. We only tried beef/lamb gyros. Owners are very friendly. Food came quickly and the pita bread was fluffy and soft. We didn't feel overly stuffed like the food was heavy or greasy. Which is a good thing for sure. Will come back and try something else.  Nice to have some different places opening up."}
{"text":"I have had Mediterranean food all over the valley so I know this food, this is my favorite cuisine. Food is alright, I have had better gyro, but what I found so surprising that I got humus appetizer small, costs 4 bucks and no bread. I am pretty sure you never serve humus without pita bread. Story doesn't end here, soup also cost 4 bucks and has a bread on side. It's not about the dollar for additional pita bread but I have never been served humus with no bread. Go judge for yourself"}
{"text":"This is a local Surprise gem!

The food is great. My family & I tried the hummus & pita, chicken kabob, chicken shawarma, lentil soup, and split pea soup. Everything was great. A few of us even thought the split pea soup was the best we'd ever had. 

The prices are totally reasonable and the family that owns the place is very inviting and clearly takes pride in their establishment."}
{"text":"I am so ecstatic that the old owner  and has wife are back! The menus back to original and the food is just as good as it was so grateful made my day"}
{"text":"One of the best falafel I have had in a very long time! Perfectly fried crispy on the outside and still very moist and smooth on the inside. Meaty sampler was delicious! The chicken kabob was full of flavor as well as the chicken shawarma. The beef lifts and gyro were perfectly cooked and spiced as well. The hummus was textured beautifully and tasted amazing as well! Very very very good food and I will definitely be back as well as sending friends to eat here!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent food and the folks are all wonderful here. Very good pricing too!"}
{"text":"We looked up the reviews and decided to visit this place. This is a family run eatery. The food is delicious and well made. We had the chicken kabob combos and Gyros. We were quite impressed with the quality of food. 

In the service department, most of the staff was amazing. There is one member of the staff that serves at cash counter who seemed to put us off. His friends were at the restaurant and he would go to them and seemed to be making fun of us and other guests. He needs to learn to be professional. 

Overall good food. I would recommend the place for the food. Every thing is great other than that one member of the owners family."}
{"text":"Bought lunch for my daughter and myself. It was fabulous.  The meat was tender and tasted great. The owner and his wife and I am assuming their son were all very welcoming and made me feel valued as a customer. I will be going back to eat there again."}

{"text":"Today my husband and I had lunch at Paradise Mediterranean Grill.  
It is a small comfortable restaurant near Sprout's in Surprise. We have a new favorite restaurant!! The gyros are just right! The kind that you crave."}
{"text":"This place just opened 3 days ago. Walked in and took a menu, place was very clean & staff was very nice. Ordered to go bc I had a sleeping kid. I waited for my food in the car, said it would be a little bit of a wait bc my kabob was being made fresh. I had no issues with that at all, they were nice enough to bring my food out to my car even though it was raining. The food was delicious!!! My chicken kabob was very flavorful & the pit was warm and soft 

So glad to have the place in surprise! I'll def be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent. The gyro is my favorite.  They are all so nice. Great addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"Really good. Crispy and flavorful falafel, which is hard to come by in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Great prices and amazing food.  Everything is made to order so prepare to have a little bit of a wait, but totally worth it"}
{"text":"Have been waiting for Mediterranean food in Surprise for so long!  Just amazing. Great food and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have driven by many times and wondered how it would be. So glad we stopped in today! This is the best Gyro place in town! Spotless. Fair prices. Friendly service. It took a while to get our food because it is prepared fresh.  It was delicious! Flavorful meat (Beef Gyro) with right amount of veggies and sauce in a soft pita. Hubby had Beef Kabob. Excellent! We will go back often. Also got the baklava. I've had better. Needs to be sweeter and more moist! Yum, we will be back often!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! A great Greek place in Surprise! This place is so good. The food is amazing and I love it when it's family-owned. You have to wait a little for your food, but it's worth it. We had a gyro pita and chicken with hummus. I can't believe how much meat they give you! Everything is super fresh and the meat isn't dried out. We are so impressed and can't wait to make this a regular place."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  The people are so nice and the food is scrumptious. I had to go two days in a row. I had the falafel salad with a side of pita bread ( the best pita ever). My dad had the chicken kabob and the beef kabob. He loved both. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I am giving this place three stars because I am very picky when it comes to Greek food and there are only three restaurants in the valley that deserve four or five stars but if I had to break this down I would give them four stars for service with that said this is the best Greek place in Surprise Arizona because there is only two as of now and the other one isn't that great. I ordered a large chicken kebab salad with two skewers of chicken kebab. It was very tasty and I ordered a side of falafel with garlic sauce very good as well my only complaint is that the salad did not come with a pita bread and the salad seemed a little weak on lettuce and greens they  should beef up your salads a little bit with more greens to make it look like the picture other than that the dressing and the chicken kebab was very tasty I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Everything was homemade and fresh. Big portions too. Service was friendly and fast. So glad to see a good authentic  Mediterranean restaurant on this side of town. Looking forward to the baklava. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean restaurant I have found in a long time. I usually get the combination plate, and everything is excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just a simple restaurant where you order at the counter and get served very good Greek food for an inexpensive price."}
{"text":"After seeing so many positive reviews I was really disappointed. They have apparently changed their menu and it is awful. 

I got the chicken gyro bowl and the meat did not even resemble chicken. The rice was flavorless. There was no hummus. My girlfriend got the falafal sandwich was better than the chicken bowl, but it was burned. Nothing was worth the price paid. 

Everything was served off of Styrofoam and we were the only customers for about an hour period. 

Too bad they used to be fantastic... We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This grill is very fast to serve, amazing prices, even better food. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. They treat you as if you were family. Will be back soon."}
