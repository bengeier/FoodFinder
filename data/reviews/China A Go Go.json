{"text":"Best Chinese food in this side of town. Almost everything is great. Their take-out and delivery is extremely fast. The only dish that is not great is the Pad Thai, it is pretty bad to be honest. Other than that though the quality of the food surpasses any other Chinese place around here. Price is more like 1 and a half $'s."}
{"text":"Love this place for hangover Chinese.love the Kung pao and NY style chop suet"}
{"text":"Gross!!!!! Not even worth 1 star.. horrible.. taste- bland really really bland my kids didnt even like it & they love Chinese food.. disgraced their culture(&im part Chinese, i eat A LOT of Chinese food) they should do everyone a favor & close it Eewwwww!!!! They are still open because Southern Highlands has very limited asian cuisine. GROSS!! WASTE OF MONEY.. people that like this & gave them more then 1 star has NO taste buds. Matter of fact hasn't has REAL Chinese food.. China a go go has to really GO GO GET OUTTA HERE! GROSS CHEF'S SHOULD BE FIRED. DISGRACE EWWW"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The chicken is not grilled it's more like boiled soft. True teriyaki chicken is supposed to be grilled. The chow mein noodles are big and fat kind of reminds me of fettuccine pasta.. If you already have a favorite Chinese place in town trust me and stick to what u know. Don't try this place you will not like it at all."}
{"text":"Thought I was back in NY City (minus the thick bullet proof screens and extra charge for more duck sauce).

This place has some of the best Chinese food around!!!!

The portions are HUGE and the food is great. 

One thing you can really tell that a different cook made the dish from time to time one really likes ginger and one not so much. Its an interesting twist to the same dish. If you like a subtle change to the flavor of your dishes then its not a big deal but if you like it to be the same all the time then be aware it might not happen.

Overall great selection and good value for the money and it does not take a long time to get your food even if you have it delivered.

I'm hooked"}
{"text":"After 2 hours and 5 calls I still did not receive my food but they took the money off of my card right away and also took a 10$ tip from my account without my authorization. Then stated that they had no idea where the 10$ went that it must have been my bank. I will be reporting them and I will never order from this China go go ever again."}
{"text":"First Chinese I've had since moving to Vegas and I really enjoyed it. I ordered the hot garlic sauce with chicken and fried rice. It was very good, spicy with a great flavor. I'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"I love China a go go!!!! Never fails me! Closest to authentic street Chinese that I can get in Vegas. Reminds of my younger days in Los Angeles china town. Very quick service. Only thing I'd recommend is to up the shrimp ratio on dishes. Other than that they are always prompt and friendly. The taste is amazing and flavorful. I'd recommend the combination fried rice as well as the walnut chicken.... Don't forget the egg rolls."}
{"text":"we would not get seated for having too many kids in our group. I tried to level with them. They would let us dine in. I wonder if all china a go go s are as strict. Kids are kids."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat!  We get take-out here at least 1x per week. 

The service is awesome.  They are fast, professional, polite. They always get the order correct. Phone in orders are ready and on time as promised.

Food is first rate. Ingredients are fresh and cooked perfectly.

Will definitely keep going here!!"}
{"text":"noodles are dry no flavore need to add more flavor rice was dry wont order from here again"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating from this establishment. I ordered Combo Fried Rice & Chinese Chicken Salad.  Below is the content of the email I sent them after partially consuming the Combo Fried Rice, the remainder of which went in the garbage. I don't know about the salad because I was not able to eat after the rice.   

Initially, I thought anyone could have a bad day and that I would not post a review, but contact them by email to state my dissatisfaction and follow up with a phone call so they could discontinue serving that rank pork.  However, when I called the gentleman who took my call blamed me because I ordered it at 11:30, but was calling 2 hours later.  I explained to him that the food was not delivered until 12:30 (as stated 40- 55 min for delivery) so he could just stop it because we know that it did not go bad in 1 hr. or 2 hrs. for that matter.  He then went on to tell me how fresh the food was etc...  I explained that I was not calling to get anything from them, but just asking that they do not give that meat to anyone else.  The guy wanted to continue the debate and I expressed to him that I had initially decided not to post the review, but since he did not think it was necessary to do anything about the bad meat that I felt obligated to post the review.  So here you have it:
    
The pork in the Combo Fried Rice was old and should have been thrown away.  I am sick and tired of restaurants that chance getting people sick just to save a nickel or dime, especially in delivery orders that are not likely to be returned.  Guess what?  You save nothing if people are afraid to eat there.  Not that it matters to you, but now I have to try and make it through the remainder of my work day with a stomachache.  In the future I'll stick to Panda Express.  People say it is not authentic, but I prefer that to ptomaine or botulism.  Throw the old stuff away.  It is not worth someone getting sick"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Clean restaurant and very friendly staff, if you feel like Chinese food you have to come here it will become a family favorite place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had Chinese food delivered from China A Go Go several times and have been happy for the most part.  I have generally purchased through GrubHub and this restaurant delivers extremely fast.  There has never been a mistake in my order.  I have to comment about one delivery, though. :-)  The driver asked me to please order my food earlier because of my house location and because it was their peak busy time.  Problem is...I placed my order at 4:30pm.  Do they expect me to eat my dinner at 3:00pm because it's more convenient for them?  Very odd.

That said, I've really enjoyed their food.  My family has been less enthusiastic saying that they think the flavoring is somewhat bland.  In some dishes, such as the garlic chicken, all you get is heat - very little flavor.  I particularly like the chicken fried rice and broccoli beef and would recommend those dishes without reservation.  Overall, the location is convenient, delivery is fast and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food, but not the best in town. Only ate here because it was nearby."}
{"text":"Foods great I'll give that but I asked for fried rice and they charged me extra without even getting it on my receipt saying its extra next time tell people/me its extra on my receipt not in person."}
{"text":"Great food , and amazing service I will for sure go back as a repeat customer !

I think the place can be cleaned a little more but other then that it's actually great my visit was fast accurate and very fresh"}
{"text":"Great food ! Service was iffy  but food preparation was quick only waited about six minutes seven minutes for five different entr√©es great can't argue with that"}
{"text":"Just ordered from this restaurant , had it delivered 
This was a Saturday evening they delivered within 20 min , (we were about. 1 mile away ) but still for a Saturday that was very good.
The food was very good and the crispy fried noodles were excellent 
Not disappointed at all !"}
{"text":"Took an hour and a half to get to my location even though it ran on the same main streets as them. Found a hair in my egg rolls, and did not receive the correct amount. Nor was there any napkins or forks, wtf! Never again."}

{"text":"Their pork slices are hard tough and they didn't want to give me my money back she wanted to argue with me about how good they are and that nobody complains about it and it was delivered to my house and I don't know if she gave me credit for it I'll see when I go in next time"}
{"text":"Paper wrapped chicken is awesome.  It can be a little greasy but I could eat them until I explode.  The combo plates are fairly priced and there are plenty of combo plates available.  If I lived closer I would eat here more."}
{"text":"Great selection of meals with a large selection of lunch specials (11am - 4pm). Fast and friendly service for a Chinese \"fast food\" style establishment. Food was great and large portions served. Will be back again and again as they are very quick and easy with delivery available as well."}
{"text":"P.F. Changs this is not. Nor would I expect it to be. That said...

Not sure why this place is still open or why people like it. It's absolutely disgusting!  I seriously question the standards of those who deem this place great or even good. It's far from either. 

Food quality poor, its like they use the worst cuts of beef around for Mongolian Beef & try to pass it off as something edible & pleasing when its clearly not. Fried rice is that of cardboard. Everything is soupy, greasy, and just not appealing at all. If you want MONGOLIAN BEEF SOUP,\" this is your place. 

Chop Stix is soo much better & up Bermuda at Silverado Ranch. 

Save your money, your stomach, and palate & avoid this place. I don't know about the other locations but this one could use a Kitchen Nightmares makeover. The owners would do well to pay attention to the bad reviews. They certainly are deserving of them."}
{"text":"Food and service is amazing!!!! I always get there lunch specials which are so good and for the price can't beat it!!!! I have gotten their sushi take it and it has been perfect I can't say anything bad about the food!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be good, but the last 2 times we ordered the food was watery & tasteless.  They need to get a new cook."}
{"text":"China a gogo, what can I say other then absolutely delicious! I ordered the honey walnut shrimp which cane with the standard steamed white rice all was cooked to perfection. The shrimp was nice, savory, and crispy! And the whote rice was the right consistency. Some places cant get that right but china  a gogo did! Will have to bring my husband!"}
{"text":"Easy location, friendly staff and delicious food, I really enjoyed the combo fried rice and the kung pow is damn good."}
{"text":"Wow! Very impressed. Just saw this place for the first time yesterday. We looked up the reviews and decided to try it. Food was great and fast. Reasonably priced and huge portions. Will definitely have take out from here again."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch special $6 and change. Comes with rice, noodles and one entree. It was really good lots of flavor. Very friendly staff and clean. They even gave my daughter fried donut while we waited, really nice of them. Will come again."}
{"text":"I  love this place my friend know it is whereI will choose when it my time pick a place to eat I really  like the Mongolian beef"}
{"text":"Placed an online order for pick up. They screwed up our order & gave us food we didn't even order. It was an online order, how hard is it to read on a computer screen what someone ordered?? Won't go here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! My husband ordered 9 entrees from their party package for our son's birthday and we were very pleased with their serving. Everything was perfectly cooked plus they filled the tray with the right amount of food good for 40-50 guests. They also included additional free food items. They delivered right on time!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese in town! The delivery service is always quick and the food is hot! Recommend the chow mein and shrimp friend rice.  Try the crab Rangoon for starters too!"}
{"text":"The chow mein is great!  The other dishes are flavored well but usually a little skimpy with the meat.  Definetely worth trying though!  Good chinese food....for vegas anyway."}
{"text":"Good, quick Chinese take-out. Prices are fair, the staff is nice and my food is always ready within 10-15 minutes. They have good sized portions. I usually get the personal dinner and that can easily feed 2 people. However, like most Chinese places around Henderson, they serve lo mein versus chow mein. I'm originally from California and had access to several authentic Chinese take-out spots/restaurants and I am still on the hunt for a place in Henderson that serves great chow mein."}
{"text":"Great recommendation by neighbors. Only been open a week at this location. Ordered the sweet and sour chicken with chow mein noodles and it was delicious. Can order chow mein without the veggies; just he way I like it. Friend ordered the orange chicken and it was great. Staff was friendly. Highly recommend. Be prepared to take home left overs. Each order enough for three people."}
{"text":"Disgusting & they got our order completely wrong. Came home to find out they did it that way so we had to pay $20 more not getting the meals like we ordered! Will not be going to this filthy place again."}
{"text":"I love this place! And I just found out that they deliver! Oooh yeeeaaahhh buddy! Lol I love the corn egg flower soup. :)"}
{"text":"Good'Ol Chinese food, taste great, and very cheap with the lunch special."}
{"text":"Great place for yummy Chinese food. 

When I went here I got the orange chicken with white rice. 

Everything was executed well, and I had no complaints."}
{"text":"Oh, China A Go Go.... You're like that boyfriend where, sure, he's nice and all...and not unattractive or anything...but you know that if you just got out a little bit you were bound to meet someone that was smoking hot and hysterical...

Am I making sense?  Probably not (I rarely do).  I go go (haha) to China A Go Go out of convenience.  It's so close.  And the food isn't bad- in fact the veggie chow mein is consistently pretty good.  And the garden veggies are usually pretty fresh and not overcooked.  The place is clean and the employees are friendly....  It's just... this placing is missing that little extra special something.  It needs to go from that nice but boring boyfriend to the hot and fun one.

The problem is I tried a couple other nearby places and got burned (read: inedible).  So, I always wind up back in the arms of the safe and steady boyfriend when I need my take-out fix.  

I guess for now I'll stick to the safe bet.  But I'll always be keeping my eyes open for someone more fun to take his place..."}
{"text":"We went here to have a bite and unfortunately there was a notice from the health inspector that they had been shut down due to unsanitary conditions. We will  not be back after that."}
{"text":"The food was very good and it's not expensive.  The service was very attentive giving us plenty of refills and checking in on us."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Good service and you can't beat their lunch specials.  It's a little on the greasy side, so if your thinking heathy this my be a bust for you unless you order proteined  out!"}
{"text":"We always get take out so I can't comment on delivery or service in the dining room but as far as food goes, it's great. Made to order so it's fresh and as a repeat customer they often throw in free egg rolls or crab rangoons."}
{"text":"This review of China A Go Go (CGG) in Anthem Village is based on at least 6 dinner visits over the past two months. I'll admit, right off the bat, the food is pretty good and probably better than average for fast food take-out. My gripe is with the rest of the experience. This appears to be a family-owned, family-operated establishment. Whether or not the staff are actually related to one another is irrelevant to this review but it makes for good analogy.

At my latest visit -- indicative of all my earlier visits -- I was \"greeted\" by a staff where absolutely everyone was on their smartphone playing games, texting, surfing or whatever. At least the young man, \"the son\", at the register put down his phone, greeted me with a welcoming smile and asked for my order. The patriarch of the \"family\" never looked up from his phone and I can honestly say that I've never been greeted by this manager/owner at any time I've ever visited. (The more friendly matriarch, who usually takes my order, was not in the restaurant the evening of my latest visit.) After paying for my order, I noticed that, one by one, the cooks put down their phones and got to the task of making my dinner. I did not see any one of them wash their hands before preparing my food (fortunately, stir-fry woks are very hot). I sat at one of the half-dozen or so empty tables (all the tables were empty except the one the patriarch was seated at) and waited. The tabletop was dirty and there was food on the floor. The small seating area appeared old and the walls really need a refurbishment of sorts to patch holes and refresh the sickly yellow paint. There are cardboard boxes along one wall (containing food and supplies?) along a corridor that leads, I think, to the restroom; a large mirror; a flatscreen TV; and Asian-themed decorations that really need to be cleaned and dusted. It looked like there was a half an inch of greasy dirt and dust on the top of room's motion-detector and the fluorescent light fixtures in the dining area really need to be cleaned out. My food was served hot and well-prepared with fresh ingredients in \"traditional\" boxes and styrofoam containers along with a container of red \"sweet and sour\" sauce; two packages each of Chinese mustard, soy sauce and fortune cookies; and a small bag of pretty good crispy wonton strips (a nice touch). The portions are large (half-orders are available) and well-worth the approximately $18 I paid for an appetizer, a main dish and fried rice.

I agree with other reviewers who write that CGG's food is better than Panda Express' mostly because the food is freshly prepared and not left standing in a hot buffet steam tray for some unknown period of time. But I believe that all staff who are in the \"front of house\" should be welcoming to their customers; staff should not be preoccupied with outside activities especially when customers are around; staff should practice good hygiene and technique before touching and preparing food or handling \"to go\" packages; staff should not be standing/sitting on the ground out in front of the restaurant smoking cigarettes; and that the restaurant and seating areas should be clean and properly maintained. I'll continue to visit CGG from time to time for the food and convenience but I don't think I'll ever really feel welcome or comfortable eating there.

It makes me sad to write this review because I truly believe the \"family\" that owns/operates this restaurant is trying to make a good product for their customers. I'm not trying to hurt their business; rather, I hope this review helps them to make their business better. I'll update this review if I notice any positive changes.

-- 3.0 stars for the food minus 1.0 stars for the experience"}
{"text":"It is the perfect mix of fast food and authentic. Everything tastes a lot more authentic Than another place such as panda express. Although that does come with the drawback of being more expensive as well (but very much worth it.) All the workers work fast and are nice. They have A LOT of menu options. And it is overall a very good experience.  Its fast like fastfood but is more like professionally cooked chinese food. 5 stars all the way. (Still have yet to be disappointed)"}
{"text":"China a Go Go needs to GO-GO!  This was one of the worst Chinese restaurants that I have experienced.  Ordered the Orange Chicken and it should be called Soggy, Drenched Chicken Wanna-Be.  The meat (if you can even call it that) was a very low grade. Probably fake chicken from a can. Very chewy.  Then they try to cover up the non-chicken by saturating it in the sauce, which by the way, did not have any resemblance to an Orange Sauce either in look or taste.  Chow Mein noodles were even off, very greasy.  Not to mention, the service was horrible.  The girl who took our order was not friendly and acted as though taking our order was a burden rather than a pleasure.  If you want cheap Chinese, go to Panda Express.  At least you get real chicken."}
{"text":"China A No No. 

A cheap chinese food restaurant serves its purpose of providing quick easy take out for lunch, lazy nights or a hungover meal. 

My 2 out of 5 star rating is based on my idea of a standard take out chinese restaurant as described above.

I would recommend to China A Go Go-somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Life savers. I was sick and stuck at home. Delivery was quicker than expected and the food was delicious as usual.  Very easy process, highly recommended."}
{"text":"The restaurant is only about 10 minutes away from my warehouse. I order from there all the time. More than 30, 40 times already. Everytime it would be 30 to 40 minutes. Sometimes it takes longer if the restaurants are busy. But today I've waited over 80 minutes and the food was still not delivered but I have to take my friend to the airport so I left and I call in to cancel the reservation . On my way to the airport the delivery guy called while I was driving, and I explained to him that the order was canceled. Than he goes off about how it takes him more than 30 minutes to drive to my warehouse and that he will never deliver to us again. Which is fine with me because I don't think anybody thats hungry would want to order food and wait a hour and half before they eat. Again, I know exactly where the restaurant is, less than 10 minutes drive away from my warehouse. I only cancel the reservation because I have to take my friend to the airport. But now I don't think anyone should order from this restaurant unless you like taking crap from a delivery guy. By the way the one star is for service not the food"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Chinese food place in Henderson/Las Vegas!! The food is ALWAYS good and the prices are great. I am from Chicago, so I expect good Chinese food and this place has met my expectation each time. I don't understand why out here all Chinese food places put peas and carrots in their rice and are unable to take it out....NOT here!!! They cook your food just the way you ask. I eat in and I get delivery. The guy who delivers is a real sweet heart. When I come in, he still recognizes me and ask me about my day. The food comes really quick when you get delivery. Its always hot and fresh. I just love this place and will recommend it to anyone (which I have done tons of times lol)....keep up the good work all you guys there!! I am a happy customer who will always return!!!

~Kona"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to order some Chinese takeout from here as we are visiting Las Vegas and staying just a couple of miles up the road. We were astonished at the generous portions (the bag was super heavy as I carried our order of two entrees). We thought the quality of the ingredients was of high quality and the portions were very generous. I would definitely be a regular if I lived in the area. I highly recommend the takeout from this location if you live in the area, are staying in the area, or just feel like having some tasty and well-priced Chinese. They have great variety on their menu."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  I can't recommend the mongolian beef, but the orange chicken was good, the rice was perfectly steamed, and they threw in a free order of fried wontons which were decent.
Service was good, fast enough, and staff was friendly.  My girlfriend was very happy with her veggie pad thai, and eggplant with tofu, but I'll let her post her own review."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Every time I get the food delivered its at my house within 15-20 mins.  The only thing I tell people if you don't like spicy them tell the person taking the order (not to spicy). Great Chinese take out."}
{"text":"ordered delivery, they said about 45 minutes, not bad considering it was dinner hour on a saturday evening, food got here in about 30 minutes.....food got here, and it was pretty delicious tasting.  only complaint i had, which i cant even really complain about, is that when i called to order, it was very difficult to understand the lady on the other end of the phone due to her thick accent.  but my order was EXACTLY as i ordered it. and got here pretty damn fast!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever.. Don't be fool by Chinese people eating there.... If you don't speak Chinese it is impossible to order your food.. Everything had to much oil and the place is dirty"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food at a great price. Food is always fresh and cooked to order. There are always people going in and out, so you know the turnover is good. These guys are serious about delivery. Every time I have eaten here, the delivery guy, literally RUNS to his car. 

If you are looking for great Chinese food, this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I have a craving for (Americanized) Chinese food. Their Food & Customer Service is ALWAYS top notch. 

I highly recommend their Orange Chicken, Crab Rangoons, and most importantly the Wontons."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.

Much better does exist out there... somewhere... and cheaper too.  Unfortunately, they don't exist as close by for when I need my version of comfort food.

Short answer is yes, they'll do if you got a hankering.  I went for a low risk chicken chow mein.  If they can pass this simple test, then at least I can give them another shot later on.  Decent ingredients and decent serving size, but I'd say about 25% over-priced.  Tastey noodles; therefore they'll receive a passing grade from me.  Stir fried just right and without excessive oil.  When I can't take it any more, I'll probably be back.

The Asian staff was a bonus, but it looked to me that the menu had been Americanized some.  Sad what has to be comprised in order to survive.  I guess my biggest qualm is that I've been spoiled by growing up surrounded by good, cheap, authentic Chinese food.  So when an establishment can't meet all three criteria, I just pine for days of ol'.  Maybe my standard isn't terribly fair, but since I know it to exist, the burden is on them."}
{"text":"How does this place get such shitty reviews?  

The last time I went here was a couple of years ago, and I remember not being able to get enough of this place.

Maybe people were just ordering the wrong things. What I usually order is their Salt & Pepper Porkchops, Hunan Beef, and Hong-Kong Style Chow Mein. The Hunan Beef is my all-time fave, and the HK Style Chow Mein is a nice difference from your usual chow meins. 

So thank you China-a-go-go. I shall cherish my memories of Hunan Beef 4eva."}
{"text":"So good love this place the cashier girl is always nice and seems happy she waits patiently for your order I like going for the lunch special great price for Chinese take out"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times before but this time the food was tasteless - all $40 of it. The delivery was on time but not sure if I'd be willing to take a chance on the food again"}
{"text":"Don't do it. All I ordered was the Egg Rolls. However, Customer Service was great."}
{"text":"I finally found the best Chinese food near me in Allianti!  We ordered the family meal and got plenty of food, hot and fresh take out. The family meals give you a few items with 2 main dishes. The food was outstanding!  Every dish was fresh and tasty.  We came in to order take out and you could see the chefs in an extremely clean kitchen.  My mother used to say if you see Chinese people eating in a Chinese restaurant then the food is good.  She was right!  China a Gogo in Allianti has the best food."}

{"text":"I'm a regular  Food is always fresh. Staff very nice and sweet,  offers free drink while you wait. Quick... Eat in or out... no bad experiences so far. Since they've open, I have been in 100 times atleast. They are saved in my contacts"}
{"text":"Food is decent, generous portions, and reasonably priced. I tried the Mongolian beef. Not the best I've ever had but it was good. Came with a large side of white rice. I also ordered Boba Milk Tea. It was fantastic! 

I like the ambiance here. Seems most people come to pick up to-go orders but there are comfy seats inside. Booths and tables. They play j-pop and other Asian music inside. I liked that. 


The staff is very friendly! One lady was being a bit of a pain asking ridiculous questions and the staff was gracious in response to her. Overall, I would come back again. Fair food, fair price, friendly staff."}

{"text":"I should've just gotten sushi from Albertsons because I feel sick, and didn't even eat any fish. Over $50 wasted, and I'm still hungry because I honestly thought I was going to vomit if I ate another piece. Best place in town for bulimics. Excuse me, I'm going to sit by the toilet for a bit."}
{"text":"I would give this Psuedo chinese food restaurant NO star!! , in addition to the Moron award to the order taker and the manager?. Ordered two dishes with nobody in the restaurant, literally nobody. one order taker was taking a phone order and another lady was preparing a phone order. Simple enough, after that worker was done with the phone order, she proceeded to take my order. Two dishes to go. transaction complete and we sat down and waited.,  Now for all of you who have given this food establishment a glowing rave reviews, know that this place is small and open kitchen where you can see cooks prepare your food. 10 minutes past, nobody in this place, but the cooks, cashier and us. 20 minutes past, phone order go out to be delivered. We are staring at the cooks if our order is being cooked. cashier and the manager are doing their fuckery things, we sit waiting occasionally catching the eye of the person who took our order.  25 minutes past , a family of 5 walks in, order  and sits down. We still wait. After 30 minutes  i noticed the family after us is getting their order prepared, they must have ordered the lunch special because noodles and fried are getting the star treatment on the wok. Twenty feet from where we sit the person who took our order still doing said  phone orders too engrossed to take noticed that customers are waiting over half an hour for TWO SIMPLE DISH that shouldn't take no more than 10 minutes to cook. I finally got up walk up to the counter asked how many more minutes for my order. The order takers still on the phone while the other lady answers my question with a confused look like i've asked her what is the atomic weight of radium. She turns around , looks and says sorry your order DID NOT PRINT OUT. Here we sit for over 30 minutes practically making googly eyes at the workers and These A GO GO  workers not wonder why are these people just sitting there staring at everbody.  Nobody gave a shite or asked themselves what are these people patiently waiting for.? I knew china a go go is full of themselves, from previous experience with them ,but i figure i will give them another chance. NOPE NEVER AGAIN,  between the arrogance of the workers and really ill conceived customer service, never again. China A NO NO in Decatur and Ann."}
{"text":"Always the best service since they opened here in southern highlands. Food always great and the people that work there are great as well. Thank you for making southern highlands a great place to live. We look forward to your continued excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  They have some of the best pot stickers I've ever had.  The chicken Kung pua is also delicious.  Also tried the Mongolian beef, wasn't bad but I would avoid that entry.  The Portions are generous on any entry.   They have lunch and dinner specials.  The Food taste great for being a part of a chain(didn't find out till today)."}
{"text":"Lunch is great, but dinner is terrible as you will spend $30++ dollars and throw away food to get a main course, rice and noodles like the lunch special offers. They have a huge variety for their lunch specials, but apparently don't like a large dinner crowd, because the only thing appetizing you have to buy A La Cart.

Don't recommend making dinner specials similar to the lunch and charge extra, because the staff doesn't do \"customer relations\" at all."}
{"text":"This place was very good!  We ate there and while we were waiting for our food they gave us soup, crab puffs, and little crispy strips (I don't know what those are called) for free.  I appreciate stuff like that.  When our food came were surprised at how big the portions were.  I ordered the beef and broccoli which also came with fried rice and chow mein.  The broccoli and veggies were fresh and crunchy and the beef was delicious.  My husband ordered the mongolian beef which he thoroughly enjoyed as well.  The food was very affordable and the employees were attentive and courteous.  Overall, a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Almost never has China a gogo ever let me down. They have Proven time after time why it is that we call them on our days off. We have been loyal customers for 6 years and will countinue to be."}
{"text":"I'm usually a panda express kind of guy, but was in the area and looking to try a new Chinese food restaurant. The food tasted amazing, but as amazing as it tasted it wasn't worth it. Woke up with food-poisoning. 
I rarely ever receive food poisoning, but if you know anything about this symptom...it's bad. But your toilet will love you. Ha. 
Stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong and the meat was very weird. Both chicken and beef. I don't know what that was but it shouldn't be called beef."}
{"text":"This is one of the most awful Chinese food I have ever eaten and this is coming from a Chinese girl. I have ordered food for carry out twice at this place. Both times the food was packaged poorly that the bag that it came with is dripping and the food with the sauce or stew in it is basically all gone. Who puts food with a saucey stew in a carton box instead of a plastic container? This cheap business does. 

For what they charge the portions are small. I had their fried rice and it was bland and definitely not Chinese authentic. I can cook better. I had their shrimp chow mein and I can almost swear Panda Express' awful chow mein is better. I am up for giving a Chinese restaurant a 2nd chance. The 2nd time I had their \"New York chow mein\" but it wasnt very New York and it wasnt good. Basically it dripped all over the bag into other food because this business doesnt have any pride or consideration in their packaging or food for that matter. I will never eat from here ever again."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here last week. The place was a little busy. I called in an order like I always do. I showed up and paid. The cashier said it would be a few minutes, so I sat down.  As I was waiting, I noticed that no food was being made. After 5 more minutes, I noticed nobody was cooking any food. I asked the cashier what was going on, he got flustered, and said something in another language. Well finally they gave me my order and I said is this what I ordered. They checked and it wasn't. I finally got my food and left. What should've took five minutes, took 20. 
And then tonight I was going to go to Subway, and thought I'd give China another chance. 
This time I was THE ONLY PERSON in the restaurant. 
Same thing, I was waiting about 5 minutes and nobody was cooking my food. 
I thought if I just sat there, I could be waiting for 20 minutes or more. 
So China a Go Go, no more buisness from me."}
{"text":"Moved here from Los Angeles about 5 months ago and have been looking for the perfect Chinese place that is similar in taste and this place is just perfect! Every time we go, we happen to get the same waitress, a young lady with a great personality. The food quality is great and the prices are great as well. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood chinese place. Lunch specials are huge!  Chicken wings are awesome! Must trys are house special chicken and wonton soup. Delivery guy is great!"}
{"text":"It's the only Chinese place nearby that also delivers. My family usually gets a family dinner b. Lately, their quality has gone downhill. There isn't a lot of flavor in their food and their chow mein is consistently overcooked. I've started looking elsewhere for take out around the same price but much better quality. I also work in the food industry and see some health code violations on a regular basis. I'm willing to let bad service go if the food is good but now that both the service and food is bad, I'm done spending my money here. There is no reason to be rude or discourteous.
So sad, because I've been ordering food from them for the last 4 years."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very friendly staff & very quick service!  I've ordered so frequently that the staff makes me feel welcomed and that they appreciate my business."}
{"text":"I don't know how people eat this food. It is worst than Panda Express and over priced. They need to make some changes."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are awesome!!!...(Mon-Fri) ...  Reasonable price for all the food you get, what more can you ask? I come here almost once a month..."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food. I don't even care for Chinese food, but my dad does so I put it into my gps and this place came up.  Boy was I glad we went there. 

We had to drive through some sketchy neighbourhoods to get there, but the food was GREAT!

The service was rapid and friendly, and I was glad to hear that there are other stores (so that I won't fear getting mugged if I had to drive to there again). Don't get me wrong the shopping complex that it was located in was clean and newer but the 2 mile drive to the freeway was not a part of the \"Fabulous Las Vegas\" that most people ever see, or would want to.

I've lived in some rough neighbourhoods In my life...Fresno, Long Beach, Oxnard but I was too naive to understand how dangerous those places really were.  If driving through the ghetto doesn't scare you then check it out.

Please be aware that they are not all as good as the others.  I took friends to another one and the food was just okay.

Just saw that I never finished this review from July of 2011.  Please note that the review was from over a year ago so it may not reflect the current status of the food's quality."}
{"text":"The chow mien was a little too greasy, the flavor on all the food was good. 
I got the Mongolian beef & Kung the Mongolian beef was pure fat & I got about 6 pieces of beef on each and the rest is the container filled with veggies Skimpy"}
{"text":"Always great, my family and I love their food. The family specials are great and the price is affordable."}
{"text":"I Have had Moo Goo Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork a few times from this location, I have had better but it has not been to bad, except for 11-18-16. It was so bad I did not eat it. I had to just through it out, what a waist of money  $17.20.  I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and fast service. I would highly recommend most things on their menu. Thank you for the drink cups while we wait :)!"}
{"text":"Worst shrimp chow main I've had.........................................really! Dont waste your money.....cannot beleive what they serve you in also!"}
{"text":"I just moved to this area and I found this restaurant on yelp. I was surprised by both of their service and food! The cashier was super friendly! She recommended honey walnut shrimp and sesame beef, and they were incredible good! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a simple enough place, Americanized Chinese style dishes. That said, I've tasted worse. I tend to order pickup and they've yet to get an order wrong, which is pretty rare. Now it's possible that's because I order through Eat24 where it's all written down. The prices are fair for the portions and the service is what one would expect. Keeping in mind that most people only choose to post when they love or hate something I'm trying to give a fair middle of the road review for this restaurant. Im a vegetarian so I'm always thankful that they can swap out the chicken for tofu when requested without added charge. So yeah, middle of the road."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, mangolian beef, orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp are all taste good. the lunch speical is really worth, enough to fed one person and great price as well. the delivery is fast, on the phone they said it is going to take 45 min, but really took the delivery guy about 25 min, he will read all the orders to you, so freiendly and polite. 5 star all day!!! I love china a go go!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I like it ! This place is clean and the staffs are very nice to me, I got a free Chicken fried rice with my order ! Bomb !
I'll definitely bring my family to eat lunch here ! 
I heard from one of the employee said they were just open for few weeks , and they got total 12 locations in Vegas and Henderson !"}
{"text":"considering the area I knew this Chinese place could possibly be really good !! I was right the food is really good!! Very clean tasting ... Service was nice and very fast !!! I will definitely return here !!"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions. We ordered the orange chicken and sweet and sour they were alright but the fried rice was tasted kind of old. The noodles that came as a side not my favorite probably wouldn't order that again."}
{"text":"I had my food delivered. It said it would take up to 40 minutes but it took 15-20. The honey walnut shrimp was delicious, and less deep fried than Panda Express's. The beef chow mein was ok, the quality of beef was pretty good. Crab rangoons were amazing. The strawberry boba was a little too artificial for my taste. All in all good food, HUGE portions (the people below me aren't lying), and relatively quick as long as you aren't ordering right during peak hours. Would order again."}
{"text":"The delivery driver that delivered to me was very pushy , he handed the food to me I already paid on my credit card for it and he wouldn't leave until I added his tip , he forced me to tip a certain amount . He was scary and I would never want to be put in that uncomfortable situation again"}
{"text":"We never order from any other restaurant when it comes to Chinese food. It's always super fresh and super good, you cannot go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this China a go go for a few years, regularly. Usually at least once a week for fine in, take out, and delivery. The food has always been great, with good value, and that is why I've been a regular. After my experience last night, i believe I will find another place to eat Chinese close to home. The hours on the door and Yelp indicate they close at 9:30p.  Last night, we showed up at 8:56pm, so we should have been good. We were met at the door and said they were closing and weren't going to let us in unless it was for a take out order. After telling Ray, who seems to be in charge, that we still had over a half hour before they close, he let us in to order. As always, the food was great and quick to get to our table. Close to when we were done eating our meal, it started to smell like very strong chemicals. We looked over and they were doing heavy duty cleaning on the wok area. We were starting to choke on the smell of chemicals, so we decided to leave. One of the female servers had her face covered so she could breathe better too. As we were walking out the door, about 9:20, I decided to go talk to Ray. I asked if he was the manager, he said no. I asked who was in charge, she said no one was in charge. I said, really? Because you are here almost every time I am and everyone seems to go to you as if you were the person in charge. After that, he admitted he was the person in charge. Honestly, he must be the general manager or the assistant since he is always there. Anyways, I let Ray know how dissatisfied we were about almost not being let in over a half hour before closing, and then to have to breathe in the harsh chemicals while we were still eating. It appeared they were still cooking food, which is even worse!! Health department would have shit themselves if they seen that! And the packaging area looks very sloppy. I told all that to Ray, and he had an attitude with me, saying that the cleaning is why he wasn't going to let me in. So change the hours on the door, Ray!! Cleaning is very very  important, but should be done after closing hours. Ray's attitude is terrible. He does not try to understand the guests point of view. Food is , service last night was . Change the hours on the door Ray, try to understand your customers, and own up when someone asks if you are in charge. Your cooks and servers do a great job. They seem scared of you Ray, but they do a great job."}
{"text":"Very clean. Everytime I visit, there is always someone cleaning the dining area. Love the lunch deals, The food is great and the portions are awesome."}
{"text":"Great place, for the money it cannot be beat. Especially like their teriyaki chicken bowl. But everything I have tried has been good"}
{"text":"In this part of town...it would consider decent compare to Panda Express. It's a hit or miss at this place. Wish it could be more consistent on their flavor."}
{"text":"Cold food  not a good experience. Not to mention pricey. What more is there to say, the first time we ordered pretty good. The last two times not so much."}
{"text":"Continuing on the quest of finding good Chinese food in Las Vegas we tried this place. Not much aesthetically, but clean bathrooms and good food. All the workers seem to be authentic Asians and you can taste that in their dishes. I had a vegetarian chow mein and my husband had Hunan.  Both good choices.  Servings seem more of family style portions. We'll be returning :)"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY, I ordered over 40$ of food that was ready while I was waiting over 15 minutes in the location just to be ignore while barely 3 people working in the kitchen and no one is in the front.
STAY AWAY due to people in the kitchen using bare hands to pick salad and raw chicken and then coming back to the front to handle money when sanitizer are not to be found and place dirty that should be mentioned in the dirty dinning on channel 13!
STAY AWAY due to no one barely speak English and no manager in charge!
STAY AWAY due to these violations are repeated when I came back to return the food that was dry yes even the rice!
STAY AWAY if you don't want dry chicken with minimal teriyaki sauce that was disgusting.
STAY AWAY if you don't want to be upset due to the lack of helping and ignoring your request to get your money back due to lame excuses of too busy and too busy, apparently with barely 3 workers in the location every small order will be too busy!!!
this place not worth to stop even for bottle of water
this place is for sure CHINA NO NO!"}
{"text":"Really nice place for a big family the food is really good specially the house special chicken and chow main ."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Best Chinese spot on the Eastside. I'd recommend the family combos. They've got lunch combos throughout the week as well. Service is quick along with the food. We were surprised at how fast it was."}
{"text":"Wonderfully nice people , good coupons in there ads for free egg rolls with order, and the Honey Walnut Shrimp is like, the best thing since Sliced Bread."}
{"text":"This restaurant has repeatedly gotten orders wrong.   The last time I ordered Chicken Pad Thai and they forgot to put Chicken in the dish.   Once home I realized and called but the store was closed already, so I left a message with my number.   No call back.  I went in the store a week later and they told me there is nothing they can do.   They just lost a customer forever.   Careless on the food and no regard for customer service.   Plenty of other restaurants in area, avoid this one."}
{"text":"I would give it more star's but really all I get is the house fried rice(any combination) . Since pik up stixs left they're the best and their teriyaki bowl, Better than teriyaki madness and Cheaper."}
{"text":"SHUT DOWN as of 3/31/2014 by Southern Nevada Health District for having 46 outstanding demerits. I will most likely never eat there again."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, tasty, and THEY DELIVER! I've ordered both take out and delivery, and I must say that I am impressed. It isn't gourmet Chinese food, but good enough. Also, like any good Chinese food establishment, it doesn't have to be on the menu for you to order it! Pick a meat, vegetables, and any sauces, they throw it in their WOK of magic, and 5-7 minutes later, you have yourself dinner. Hell and high waters will not stop me from returning again and again."}
{"text":"read other comment I left.  food was not prepared as requested.. my last trip there,  for life."}
{"text":"food is good, employees always seem to be pleasant. I enjoyed this place regularly until I made a stop in their bathroom. it was disgustingly dirty. not messy, but as if they hadn't swept, mopped, wiped anything down since it had opened. ( I had observed this about 6 months since they opened). if they can't keep the bathroom clean, who knows what it looks like behind closed doors. haven't went back since."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Good Prices and fast delivery.  The food is always excellent and the service is great. Sometimes the delivery times are a little backed up, but if you go in for pick up, the service is always fast."}
{"text":"I went there today to get some of the bubble tea and it was delicious! They have flavors like Grape,Strawberry,Lychee,Blue Berry,Mango,Passion Fruit,Peach,Honeydew and Green Apple. They also have Boba tea which is the Thai tea with boba. Only thing I have a problem with is the price $4.57 for bubble tea, but you can't argue with it knowing its the closest place for people in the sunrise area.

All in all great asian food great boba tea and good for people who live on the opposite side of town."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and cool employees. VERY small dining, so not good for LARGE parties, but they do take-out. They're always giving away free appetizers and throwing in extra here and there. Decent prices, you get more than what you paid for. I come here more often than not and never had an unpleasant visit. Good Job guys!"}
{"text":"Great place...always nice, food is always hot, and super clean...just wish i knew what the worker next to me was eatting..that soup looks fire."}
{"text":"cant love a chinese place any better. I find myself always wanting to come here. And if i were to go somewhere else i would feel like im cheating on them. Sesame beef with extra garlic is my thing! my family likes to come here too"}
{"text":"I didn't really like the texture of their eggplant, but their sauces are pretty tasty and they give you good portions. For less than six bucks I got two good meals out of it. I just wish they'd carry brown rice."}
{"text":"Really stepped up its game. From 1 start to 5. Good job. Can't go wrong with veggie chow main. Fresh crunch veggies and noodles are not grease with a good taste."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas that's reasonably near our home. We have gone here several times since moving to this part of town and the food is always excellent with very large portions. Parking is plentiful as it is next to an Albertson's parking lot. Really the only down side is that the booths are tight for a party of 4. They are fine if there are only two, but more than that is really hard to fit all the large portions of food on the table."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today and I'm so happy I did! I'll definitely be frequenting since I work close by.  I had the cashew chicken lunch special with half fried rice and half chow mein, it was so good! It was quick, hot and the veggies were all crisp and fresh.  They weren't chintzy with the cashews!  The staff was very friendly.  A huge portion for a great price!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go. Love beef shrimp chow fun spicy and cure for hangovers wonton soup with no pork. Bomb ass soup"}
{"text":"Had the Chow fun noodles with chicken, very good. The pot stickers on the other were a little dry. I would still recommend this place to people. Good sized portions."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch at around 1 p.m. on a Tuesday. There were only a couple of people in the place, so there was no waiting (nice!) and the food was ready in a couple of minutes. I ordered the General Tso lunch meal, which was a huge amount of food for under $7! One thing that I didn't like was that everything (plates, cups, boxes) is all styrofoam; terrible for the environment, but I guess what did I expect from a quasi- fast food Chinese food place?"}
{"text":"Food was a complete disappointment. My family and I had order a couple of dishes and we couldn't be more disappointed. We ordered Veggie Pad Thai extra hot and it was absolutely DRY no flavor at all and just bad. We also ordered eggplant with tofu and that was also very disappointing, the eggplant was mushy and the sauce was like gelatin. The chow mein was also very dry. The rice was normal, and so was the orange chicken. We all instantly felt sick and can't stop throwing up. Never again will my family and I order food from here. If I could I would rate no stars!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The hot n' sour soup is so yummy and the crab ragoons are the best. Running a special right now . . . Buy 2 Boba teas and het a 3rd free."}
{"text":"Best Chinese on this side of town! Tried different places, always come back to my China GoGo...they often throw in a free crab wonton or egg roll with my orders too..super friendly and fast service, fresh delicious food with NO MSG! Delish!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here and ordered take out. The people were nice but we waited almost an hour for our order just to realize they forgot our appetizers. Food was decent but the potstickers were very thick and doughy. 2 of the 4 of us got sick from it. Not sure i want to go back."}
{"text":"Just ordered over the yelp app. Fast delivery I was expecting to wait an hour but I think it was well under 30 and the food still hot But I also don't live so far from the place. I come in the restaurant every now and then they have good food! I highly recommend! Will also be my go to place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was quick. Called in my order and was ready for pick up within 10 min. Not a bad place to go for a quick meal when you're short on time. Ordered two lunch specials: sesame chicken and orange chicken. Portions were definitely dinner size and not lunch size. Overall satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been coming here and ordering for awhile now and I've never had an issue. The food is reasonably priced and pretty darn good. If you're eating with a group, the family meals can easily feed 4 people. They also have delicious Thai tea boba!"}
{"text":"If I'm going to be completely honest this place is completely garbage. The $40 that I spent on the three meals was a bad price but the quality of the food is a whole other story. The meal I eat was spicy shrimp there was exactly 6 pieces of shrimp with a huge pile of mixed vegetables, there noodles were completely tasteless I had to drowned them in soy sauce to get any type of flavor."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 0 stars due to the fact that they refused to serve us. So we get there and their sign says they close at 9:30 pm, it's 8:57 pm and this non friendly server greets us by saying \"to go???\" And we said no we are dinning in, so with an attitude she is about to seat us when someone yells from the kitchen they're only doing to go, so I decided that if you don't want our business someone else will, there are thousand awesome places to eat in Las Vegas, just next time put a sign up that after 8:30 pm this place only does to go orders. I know we all want to go early to our families but this was completely unprofessional. Thumbs down for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm from Ca. And the chinese food there to.me is soo good, well this place reminds me.of home! I loove evrything here, my favorite dishes have to be the won ton soup and the mongolian beef, the lunch special serving size are hugeee and for the price, well its very worh it!"}
{"text":"Love their food and their prices aren't to bad either. Fast delivery time. The shrimp and lobster sauce is delicious as well as the orange chicken.  The combo fried rice is to die for"}
{"text":"The lunch is only 5.95 , come with fried rice and noodle. Unbeatable!   Boba buy one get one half price if we like them on face book. Good service! Good food! Everything made fresh to order! Love china a go go !"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, they always say \"45 minutes\" for delivery, but always make it in alot less time than that. Their price are great as well ! 

And they always give free stuff ! Everytime they forget something (which is hardly ever) when I call for delivery... They go back & bring me back whatever they got for free ! I love this place !"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken chow mein to go and I was a bit disappointed. It was all noodles with a little veggies and hardly no chicken. Service was great and fast. The place is nice and clean. I will try to order other items next time. Hopefully I won't get ripped off."}
{"text":"This place is a good balance between American style and dirty hole in the wall Chinese food. Their menu ranges from the regular sweet and sour pork to the authentic Hong Kong style noodles. My favorite is the Mongolian beef. Quite spicy and the onions are sauteed very well and provides a sweet complement to the thinly sliced beef. The staff is very friendly and they always get your order right. I think this is a family owned business which I am more than happy to support."}
{"text":"Tried China A Go Go take-out for the first time tonight and I really liked it. I had chicken fried rice, Mongolian beef and egg rolls (egg rolls were free w/coupon for $10 purchase). The food is fresh and very tasty. There's a generous serving of beef (it's not all veggies and onions like some other places). But just a warning, their \"mild\" Mongolian beef is really spicy. I drank a whole bottle of water before I could even finished my food LOL! The restaurant is very clean and has a modern touch. I think we've found our new favorite Chinese take-out place, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had delivery twice (through Grubhub) & both times was not disappointed.
Food arrived on time...even a bit early...and everything was fresh, hot, & tasty. Portions are extremely generous.
Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"After I ordered a Chinese food from other place, I was not keen.  I saw China A Go Go on Windmill next to Von's store.  I gave it try by ordering spicy salt and pepper shrimp, wontons, egg rolls, and white rice.  Oh, my spicy salt and pepper shrimp is soo spicy and good.  Wontons taste so excellent!! I am in heaven.  I kept ordering them until I went back to NJ.  When, I go visit my parents in LV, I definitely will order more!"}
{"text":"We had delivery the other night and everything was great. I especially love the honey walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of their food.  I ordered the Thai chicken salad.  Half of the salad was spring mix and the other half was head lettuce.  The salad was very fresh and the chicken was breaded fried chicken sliced in very small slices and was delicious.  The pad thai was okay.  The honey walnut shrimp was delicious.  The presentation and freshness was outstanding.  I will definitely order from them again.  The meal arrived 10 minutes earlier than expected.  You can't go wrong with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is surprisingly better than I expected (or at least it was different than what I have been accustomed to when going to these types of restaurants)  

A little pricier than what I usually pay, especially for Chinese take-out.  But, they are fast and efficient, tasty, and they are close to home."}
{"text":"I work & live in Shenzhen, China 5-6 months out of the year. When I'm back home I always order from here. If your expecting 100% authentic Chinese food your a little far from china or even china town. But if you are looking for some good Chinese Americanized takeout you cant really beat this place. I recommend the Pepper beef, Mongolian beef, Kung Pao Chiken or Sweet and Sour pork."}
{"text":"Eaten here before and it was quite good. But this time ordered the HK Crispy Style Noodles. The noodles fry instantly upon hitting the oil and should be white, these were brown that is tough and scorch tasting. Terrible. Even though the broth, meat and veggies were good the scorched noodles destroyed the dish. As it was take out, I couldn't send it back. 

Previous orders of Combination Kung Pao and Seafood Delight were very satisfactory. Portions are always generous and ready very quickly."}
{"text":"My fave for chinese take out. The food is fresh and tasty at low prices."}
{"text":"Delivery fast but the food was not fresh......chicken fried rice was ok, orange chicken good but cold, chow mien cold!"}
{"text":"It has great food and the price is very affordable, it's a good quiet place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate there about 2 weeks ago and dined in. We just had our food served to us and all of a sudden heard this clipping noise. I turned and looked back from the both we were sitting at and to my surprise the woman working ( who I believe is manager or owner) Was standing by the soda machine just clipping her nails and they were flying everywhere. I was beyond appalled and went to the register to complain, at first she tried to hide the clippers but had known I had already saw them so she told the cashier to give us our money back. The scary thought is, if thats what they are doing in the the front, what goes on in the back. Gross.....We will never eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"I don't like their orange chicken (it seems like every Chinese restaurant has their own way of preparing it) but I love their hong kong style noodles, fried rice, and other items.  The staff has always been friendly...no complaints."}
{"text":"Everytime I come they have good service and good food. Fresh, because they cook it right infront of you.

VERY AFFORDABLE AND EVERYONE SEEMS SO NICE.

This is one of my favorite place to get food at."}
{"text":"If you like mediocre Chinese food that may not be fresh upon delivery this is your place. They are incredibly rude and it's not worth the wait. I suggest going to Rice N Noodle and get much better food and customer service not that much further away.  Do not waste your money at this establishment!"}
{"text":"So I can to eat with my grandma and sister. They were really fast with seating us. They took forever to take our order. They didnt have forks or anything on the table. The food took along time and when I got my food ot was dry. Straight up unedible."}
{"text":"We tried China a go-go on a whim, because my girlfriend was sick and wanted Hot and Sour soup. This location is one of the few Chinese restaurants in our area and the closest, so we took a chance and called in a take-out order. Wow. Friggin amazing.
This place, from the outside looks like a little hole in the wall bento shop. But their food is easily fancy restaurant quality! They are a tiny restaurant, but they've got it where it counts.
Very friendly service, VERY delicious food, itty bitty dining room. Prices are on the moderate side, but once you taste it you will understand why it is worth every penny! Very impressed and will go back again. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Love their food!!! Everything is cooked fresh and to order. The prices are AMAZING!!! We love Chinese and like to switch it up. It's one of our favorite go to's. I e tried almost everything on the menu and haven't ever been disappointed. If your looking for great food at a great price..... this is a winner!"}
{"text":"These little A holes talk shit in Chinese. They can go to hell. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"this food was somewhat good I didnt really feel to welcomed I purchased a lunch special thinking that drink was included i ended up paying about 10 dollars for a not so good meal I ended up feelin my stomach grumbling so I dont really reccommend this place"}
{"text":"The sushi and chinese food aren't bad and  $20 sushi lunch AYCE is well priced.....but the SERVICE is HORRENDOUS!! I keep going back since it is literally a 3 minute drive from our house, so convenient. This was the last time though;  if the service is SHITTY then it does not matter how cheap and how just ok the food is.  We had not been sitting for a minute when a girl tried to give us 2 sushi orders and when I said \"we just got here, those aren't for us\" she continued to put them down on the table. I repeated myself and she walked away. Five minutes after this no one had come to give us menus, take our drink order; the table next to us had to loudly call her over to get a drink refill. I end up calling her over as well, she brought menus and our drinks. Ten minutes after this a guy comes by to ask if we are ready, we put in an order and 15 minutes later, we still did not have it. By this time we had been there over 30 minutes. The place was not busy, about 6 tables between the sushi side and chinese food side of the place and a guy and 2 girls serving.
If you are not hungry and have an unlimited amount of time this is the place for you.... Because you are going to have to clear your schedule and have a snack before going to this place.
It deserves less than 1 star!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered food. Took over an hour to get it. Food was all cold and no sauce or fortune cookies. Called and was told what do you want us to do we are busy but I will give you a free appetizer next time. What about the 70 I just spent.  No reply said no manager was available would never go to this place again"}
{"text":"First visit.  Waited on quickly and took our orders.  They gave us freebie soup and crispy lo miens with a dipping sauce.  I tried the crispy Hong King noodles. And the wife got the General's Chicken.  All if he good was good and I only dropped one star because they messed up our drink order.  I think it was a language thing.  Place was clean and modern.  We almost did not try this place due to the chain's bad health inspection record at their other places.  They have a grade A rating right now from their opening inspection.  We would return to try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and friendly. Has an authentic taste you won't find at a fast food style restaurant."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time. Doesn't disappoint. It's not the most delicious Chinese food I've had but it gets the job done when I have a craving."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good. Love the coconut almond shrimp. Fast service is a bonus and employees are always friendly"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for almost 4 years. We often use delivery and the food is hot, delicious and reasonably priced. Glad it is so close by and consistently a good value."}
{"text":"We received a flyer in the mail and decided to order in with this one because of the chinese/japanese fusion and the multitude of creative yet reliable dinner choices.  I have to say that the food was EXCELLENT for delivery and the price.  The spicy tuna and the kung pao chicken was a bit too spicy, but nothing I can't alter for future orders.  I will definitely be ordering from here pretty much every time I am too tired to cook.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff is polite and quick to help you. As soon as you walk in you are treated to great customer service. Every employee  has a friendly smile on their face and always greet you. The food is good and comes to you quick with good prices, unlike some other cheap chinese places that charge you for flavorless grease treats. Ordered two meals today recieved two free drinks."}
{"text":"Very good food and great deal on lunch specials you got a lot of food for such a cheap price. The workers are super nice to they gave us free egg roles and are always nice I come in a lot and they have always been super polite and they Remember your order with out writing it down"}
{"text":"I used to love this place... Until it gave me massive diarrhea. Twice. They first time i was in denial, thought it was a coincidence, but the second time it was no joke and i knew my Chinese deliciousness had betrayed me. So be warned, if you order the Kung poo chicken from china a poo poo you will spend 48 hours on the toilet."}
{"text":"Nelis china a go go is good place hope you in joy this restaurant because I like the orange chicken and the fried rice and the outside look good too"}
{"text":"I like the china a go go fried rice and orange chicken and also like BBQ ribs and I like wonton and kou chow Ming and I like tai tea boba in the china a go go in the charleston and Sloan and china a go go has walkin and pickup and delivery and china a go go don't have outdoor seting and don't have wifi and don't have tv and I like hot sour soup and I like the beef with the rice on top and they have so many Chinese cheif in the china a go go and I go there sometime I like chicken chow fun"}
{"text":"Thank God they are fast and nice, otherwise i would find a way to dish out 0 stars. 

I work across the street & everyone in the office orders food together, since it is so fast, this is often what they choose. They have a very limited \"vegetarian\" menu. I would use vegetarian very lightly because they cook it all in meat sauce, so needless to say after one bite I felt ill and had to throw it away. Their fried rice was my saving grace, the lo mein is trash worthy too.

I brought a main course to work on a different day & decided a side of rice would be nice so picked one up. Plain white rice, how on Earth could they mess this up? Well they did when i found a huge white piece of plastic in my food! No lie, it looks like the top of the bag plopped right in there and they forgot to take it out? 

Yuck. Needless to say I would rather starve on the days the office orders it, the other people say it okay but it is cheap & ready in about 5 minutes. Not surprised, who would be busy with food like that?"}
{"text":"When I'm not eating High Roller Pizza lol this is the second place I order food. It's actually not bad, I love the Shrimp and lobster sauce so good. They always deliver in a good time frame.."}
{"text":"This is really solid Chinese food!

I've had both the fried rice and the chow mein, and I enjoyed both. I recommend opting for chicken and not veggie. 

The food is cheap, the portions are huge, and it's super convenient.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"it took us years to find a good Chinese food place to accommodate our LA tastes buds and we finally found it. the staff is always pleasant and very quick on our orders. delivery is always faster than expected and the food is always fresh and hot. the works here are very nice . will come back definitely!"}
{"text":"My wife is very particular about the noodles she enjoys eating and this place delivered. Not only did it delivered on the noodles, China A Go Go has very good tasting food. I had the lunch special, orange chicken with Chow Mean and Rice - DELICIOUS. The service was fast, always a plus in my book.

I did not have a Yelp account and hardly review anything any where. I had to do it for China A Go Go. This is going to be a definate stop every Vegas trip.

Thank you China A GoGo!"}
{"text":"Very bland Chinese food. Fried rice and noodles are really dry. Nothing special about their food. Panda express is actually better. I said thank you to them more than five times on my last visit and they just ignored it. They don't know how to be thankful for their customers."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special: Shrimp with brocolli.

PROS
Food tastes good, salted just right for me. Wife says a little too salty for her.
Fast service.
Decent price.

CONS
Tasteless egg drop soup.
A little cluttered. It's a takeout joint, not a restaurant where they wait on you.
Cheap styrofoam and plastic ware."}
{"text":"all ways a joy to come smiling faces especially the girls hot and delicious food a must for lunch"}
{"text":"Best Chinese fast food in SoHi. Super fast delivery. Great menu, great food. More pricey than Panda; but also more delicious. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I have had in a very long time. Fast and friendly. Plenty of food and flavor. I regularly eat here. Huge menu pricing middle of the road."}
{"text":"Being new to the Southern Highlands, this was our first time wanting Chinese take out and found you were just 2 miles for us. We loved the Shrimp Fried Rice and will be back the next time we have a taste for Chinese Food! 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place food is good people are friendly 
Good food for the money I have no problems 
With China a go go"}
{"text":"Would have left no stars for the service since I didn't even get a chance to try the food. My wife and I walked in and never were we acknowledged, when after a few minutes of waiting and just looking over the menu board we asked the server if we seat ourselves. After asking twice she looked at us but still didn't answer. Fine, we sit ourselves and wait for a server. After the table that sat after us got served, we just left and have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"best chinese-american style food ever. 
i had salt & pepper shrimp n pad thai last night n it was so good. so i decided to try other foods. 

i ordered hunan beef n chinesw chicken salad. both were bomb!!!!! taste was soooooooo good as well as hugh portions. Delivery for this time was only took 30minutes. 

little bit pricy but the portion of food is hugh so i can eat for 3 meals with one dish. the rice they gave me is bigger than one from other restaurants.  

love it!!"}
{"text":"very bad work ethics extremely bad service and delivery time with an average or 20 minutes late from a 45 min wait time i wish i could put less but there isnt an option for it ... it is poorly managed restaurant"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout through GrubHub, so I can't comment on the ambiance of the restaurant. But I CAN comment on the quality of the food: mostly delish!

We ordered the Family Dinner B for $28. Only $2 more than the Family Dinner A, but you get a much better selection of entrees, plus two fried shrimp. If you are into seafood and want some variety, definitely go that route.

For our appetizers, we got 2 egg rolls, 2 crab rangoon, and 2 fried shrimp. Nothing special, but they held up well after the delivery. For the entrees, we had shrimp with snow peas and Kung Pao combination (chicken, beef, and shrimp) with fried rice. The rice was undercooked and a bit bland, but the entrees were both really good, although they both needed salt. And, oh yes, did I mention the soup?

By far the best part of the meal was the soup. We ordered the wonton (the other choice was corn egg flower). As the menu describes it: \"Chicken wontons with vegetables, chicken, BBQ pork, and shrimp served in light house broth.\" As  I describe it: \"One of the best soups I have ever had. No lie!\" This was more like a stew than a soup. It was so hearty that after eating our appetizers and polishing off the soup, we couldn't even crack into the entrees and had to save them for the next day!

So, overall, for $28 (plus a hefty delivery charge), we each got one excellent meal and two pretty good ones. If you dine in, you can save the delivery charge. But if you order Family Dinner B like we did (and I heartily suggest it), be prepared to bring home a lot of leftovers. And make sure to order that wonton soup. I promise you will not leave hungry--or unhappy!"}
{"text":"The food was great! It was fresh and very well spiced. The inside of the restaurant and clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend this place over any other in the north east side."}
{"text":"First time here,  EXCELLENT! Service was quick, friendly and eager to please the customer.  Kung Pao Shrimp was very good, they will adjust the spicy level to request, I tried very spicy and was delicious. Portions are large, next time we'll split and still have food left. RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"It's the only Chinese food around my house so when I crave it, I order from here. It's good food MSG for sure but idk the last few times I've had it, I threw it up"}
{"text":"Yeah, fair prices, but don't get the spare ribs, the moo shu pork, the appetizer platter, or the chow mein noodles.  Icky texture on the ribs and all were flavorless.  The egg rolls were fine, though, just normal and not greasy.  Same with the crab rangoons. So, hit or miss.  Try at your own risk?  Stick with their \"Specialty Items\"?"}
{"text":"Our family has grown to love this place and are sad we will be moving out of there delivery zone  there family dinners are amazing and there delivery is so fast and there food is on point if you u get the chance definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Fast and on Grub Hub! This is my preferred Chinese restaurant in Anthem. The food is good. We order the walnut shrimp, beef chow fun, wor wonton soup, salt and pepper fish or house fried rice. Love the friendly staff. It's good for a neighborhood Chinese place."}
{"text":"HK Crispy Noodles always on point!  If you are looking for fast authentic flavors, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Affordable and plenty of food! The lunch specials are a great deal and you'll get a cup of soup if you dine in. I am a fan of the cashew chicken, but the garlic chicken and broccoli beef is good too! I'm not a fan of their chow mein noodles but they're free with the lunch specials. My mom's a fan of the crab Rangoon. My family's favorite dish is the chow fun with black bean. Yum! We'll keep coming back because they're always fast and in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered hot and sour soup with seafood today. Great soup!  A little thicker then last time I had it. It seemed a little gelatin like but still very good. Also ordered two egg rolls. These were very good. Fresh cracked pepper inside was awesome."}
{"text":"This is probably the best China take out in the area. I love the mongolian beef. It's spicy and so tasty! The beef is sliced thin, and very wel cooked. It's so tender. The spring rolls are also great!
The prices are just right, the portions are truly enough.
I am glad that this venue at Windmill makes up for the others with the hygiene problems. My fingers are crossed that this China a Go Go stay as great as it is!
Love it!"}
{"text":"The food quality at this place has gotten worst everytime I go here. The service is terrible because of the way give you your order. Today I ordered two eel tempura rolls which didn't taste cooked , California roll which were so tiny , orange chicken , and I brought along the flyer they sent in then use it for four free egg rolls which were messy. I got my eel tempura roll and California roll and my free egg rolls and instead of my orange chicken they gave me rice. Keep in mind  they were given to me in separate bags. Which also took forever. Doing that messes up customers orders thinking that's eveything they ordered. They really need to start double checking , and getting bigger bags and putting a whole order in one bag. They are getting lazy!"}
{"text":"Have loved and been a customer for over 13 years. They are so friendly and the food is amazing. They have a semi exhibition kitchen and everything is always so clean. Great variety and willing to customize for you. Flavors are really fresh and fantastic. They have remained consistently great!"}
{"text":"A watery egg drop soup comes with the lunch special. A crunchy but skinny veggie egg roll with thick sweet and sour sauce is also party to the lunch special. I got the kung pau beef it was spicy and yummy fresh onions and green bell peppers that were good and not over cooked. The accompanying noodles were over cooked and turning into mush the fried rice was well just kind of bland and boring.  The staff was very attentive. Not bad in a pinch, but there are better fastfood chinese places."}
{"text":"This meal was not great. Got Ginger Beef and Broccoli Chicken, both lackluster. Will probably not order again."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of places in the area, and this is my favorite by far. The delivery is quick, accurate, and super friendly. I've been in multiple homes, and my is always friendly when he hits the door.

The best thing about them is that they don't cram what you're ordering with a bunch of filler. I've had other Chinese places offer up a \"beef\" or \"chicken\" dish that is basically just a bunch of chopped up veggies in a really watered down sauce, with 5-6 pieces of what you actually ordered. 

It's the best delivery in Henderson, I say."}
{"text":"I did not feel like cooking on Sunday, I tried to call a different Chinese restaurant but they were not open. I remembered years ago ordering from here. 
the delivery was fast, the food was very good. 
I had the Sesame Beef and it was delicious and the Beef Chow Mein was also very good. They gave me two free egg rolls. 
I probably will order from here again,"}
{"text":"Really good food and excellent service. I highly recommend this place for anyone. The fried rice with chicken is to die for!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a different place since we just moved into the area and are still exploring. Grabbed a menu from them and was able to find it in the junk drawer... Anyways, ordered the Dinner for two \"B\" Sweet/Sour chicken, a shrimp dish (can't remember which), mixed fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, veggies), two spring rolls. ALL were very good and even the day after! OH and did I tell you they DELIVER?! It was a quick delivery too! We'll definitely be ordering from them again, really liked the dinner for two deals for like $25~, liked the price point and dish choices."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. I love the green apple Boba here!!!!  Perfect string bean chicken lunch special. I've never had bad food here."}
{"text":"So happy with their delivery on the Eat24 app (: thanks for helping me be a homebody today"}
{"text":"I love their mongolian beef!
And I just read someone's review....why would you give them 5 stars if you dont like their service?"}
{"text":"Ridiculousness at its finest!
They don't even deserve a 1 star but yelp don't have a 0 option.
I live by the other china a go go on nellis and lakemead, apparently their phone number listed on the website is no longer a working number. I'd like to call and order on the phone and pick up to expedite process. Got 3 hungry kids at home.
So I called the Charleston location and ask for the Nellis n Lakemead location, and first person I talked to passed the phone to the 2nd person and told me she does not have the number for the location near me. She said try going on the internet and get the number from there......uuuuhhhhh heeeelllllooooo that's the first thing I told both of you and the reason why I called ur location to get the other location's info.
Smh
I got frustrated coz they act like they don't understand what I am talking about.
I like their food at China a go go but dang!!!! Worst customer service ever!!!
Bye!"}
{"text":"The food is really really good 
I tried Combination Fried Rice and it was delicious, having a lot of meat and shrimp.
Definitely gonna come back n try more of their food."}
{"text":"I judge Chinese food based upon their kung pao chicken. This kung pao was easily one of the most disappoint kung paos I have ever had. It was very bland. Delivery was quick, I will give them that. I will not be back anytime soon unless this simple dish changes."}
{"text":"Love the House Chicken here!!!!!  Great value too!  Try the Crab Rangoon too!"}
{"text":"I find it real rude when ordering my food and have to keep on repeating myself cause the lady wants to act like she doesn't know what I am saying then when my foods are being delivered shes just laughing the whole entie time! When they were about to leave i had asked Aloha shoyu they had no clue what that was??? How are you gonna serve Hawaiian food and know what it is? Did you know before it was combine all into one restaurant they did have it and that it's connected with China A gogo I feel things went down here! I use to go all the time but after this incident I rather just go to the regular Hawaiian places to order my food!"}
{"text":"Placed our order and within 5 minutes we were chowing down. Beef Pepper Steak &  Hot Garlic beef. Service was spot on. I would highly recommend this to any sit down and it could top any buffet on the north rest part of the valley."}
{"text":"Let me start this review from the end... As I walked back to my car from eating at this establishment I cracked opened my fortune cookie and this is what it said. \" the key to happiness is to lower your expectations\"  well... that would have saved this place from a low rating if I would had opened the fortune cookie right before I ate here because I was actually pretty much expecting to totally enjoy my meal.
 I stopped here around 3 pm for lunch on my way to work, I ordered from the lunch special menu the Kung pao chicken with fried rice, noodles and egg flower soup. When I got my order I was the only one there and abut six or seven employees working at the time so I sat on the corner and started eating my food, when one by one all the employees started to came out to the dinning area to have lunch, and no, is not that I mind sharing the dining area with the help, it was just that they brought in their own food, some kind of stew, they placed it on a table and they all started to serve themselves from it. Didn't know what it was I all know is that it looked very delicious and appetizing and that it wasn't on the menu, all of a sudden my Kung pao chicken didn't  looked very good it looked kinda sad on the Styrofoam container, compared to what everyone else was eating,  The vegetables were a little under cooked and the noodles and rice lacked flavor, I don't know what it was missing but whatever it was, it was not missing on their food because they were really enjoying it, so much, I was tempted to ask them if I could trade my food for some of theirs or at least ask them to sprinkle some of that we don't use msg MSG on my plate since it was pretty much tasteless but I didn't want to disrupt their lunch. 
 Would I come back? Sure.. If I get to bring my own food.
 I'm no fortune cookie, so don't rely completely on my advice but if you expect better food, go to panda express instead, and that's as low as expectations can get; after all I live in China town, I may be a little bit spoiled.
 On a positive note, the egg soup was good.....five stars for the chicken that laid the egg."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese take out place! Large portions! Great sweet and sour chicken, chow mien, etc. we take it home and always have leftovers. Price is reasonable for the large portions. I highly recommend this restaurant , will always return."}
{"text":"Late review: July 5: Delivery
It was just too hot to do anything so we decided to order Chinese.
We ordered a variety of dishes and the food was delivered hot and steaming.
Portion were big and liked how they separated the food especially the crunchy noodle dish.  The extra rice we were unable to eat we saved and made fried rice the next day."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are great! Hard to beat that price."}
{"text":"This restaurant has always done right by me and my family. Their food is delicious and they are always prompt with their deliveries. We appreciate your business and quality of food. It's tough to compare to any other China A Go Go's. Others don't come close to this one in-particular!"}
{"text":"Quick and tasty. Large portions. Love their Mongolian Beef ordered moderatly spicy. Good price."}
{"text":"Just had hot and four soup and Mongolian beef. Excellent!  And spicy. 
Served piping hot with a pleasant smile. 
You need to eat here!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Oasis RV Park down the road and saw the China a-Go-Go online and decided to give it a go.  Our expectations weren't high, since its a strip mall type setting and a Vegas chain store.  Boy, were we wrong.  Chinese is my favorite meal and I've sampled restaurants all over the country.  This place is outstanding. My wife and I ordered the Mongolian Beef lunches and asked it be made without the hot spice. This was by far the BEST Mongolian beef ever and there was lots of it.  In fact, we had the leftovers for dinner that night.  The noodles are larger than I like, but they were tasty and filling.  Put this place on your 'gotta try' list."}
{"text":"Quick service and decent food.  My go to when I want a variety of east coast style asain food fast."}
{"text":"One of the few Chinese restaurants on the east side and by far the best one in my opinion. The staff here is consistent with service and they all come around to ask for refills so you never are waiting for a long time to get a drink or your food order. 

The food is cooked fresh and fast so it makes for a great place for a quick lunch (really good lunch specials) or dinner."}
{"text":"We were here during my daughter's marching band competition at Las Vegas High School and we wanted to get some fast, cook-to-order Chinese food. We ordered3 lunch special, 2-combination Kung Pao with chow mein and fried rice and Mongolian beef with fried rice. They all were good and we got a lot of food. I've been to a few China A Go Go location but this one seems to have better and more portion of food. We were surprised. The restaurant itself looked very inviting for a sit down place if you wanted to eat there. It was clean. I would definitely go back if we were near there."}
{"text":"When you just don't feel like cooking, this place is the best.  We love the kung pao shrimp and the kung pao combination.  The corn flower egg drop soup is wonderful.
The people there are always very prompt and greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is difficult to find. When I saw this place had opened close by I thought we would give it a try. I've been there about five or six times now in the last month. The food is fresh and tasty and the service is amazing. The portions are huge and they are willing to give you extra sauces and things like that for free. It has definitely exceeded any expectations I had for Chinese food. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We like China a go go.  Great staff, consistent good food.  Love the chicken wings!!!"}
{"text":"First time in this place .. costumer service is great .. waitress was really nice  !! Place nice and clean.. they have great food and the price is okay ..!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood Chinese restaurant.... I got shrimp and chicken pad Thai....mom got chicken chop-suey"}
{"text":"Customer Service maaaaaatters. 
I was greeted and had my order taken by a man named Ommy. He was so pleasant and customized everything I wanted in my order. I always have to tweak my order for this or that reason. He was so patient! 
I appreciate that type of service and the food was fab."}
{"text":"Its funny how a bad experience can change your view on an establishment quite quickly. First off I would like to say this place is all right. Its not the greatest quality but its ok for delivery. Its not awesome in flavor, its ok. I would not suggest ordering the honey walnut shrimp, its very cheap shrimp and the flavor is not the greatest. by the time you receive it for delivery it will be soggy. maybe its better if you order in but I would not make a trip to this place to eat Chinese if I'm out an about, I would definitely go to a better place. I've ordered from this place many times in the past and your order will always come with white rice and a little bag of soy sauce, hot mustard, fried won ton strips etc. I was really sick today so I ordered some food for the kids. I decided to try something new, it was the new York style chow mein. The description states authentic new York chow mein served with CRISPY NOODLES. When I received my order at the door and brought the food to the kitchen I find the mixture of meat and veggies and no noodles to be found anywhere. I call the establishment and told the gentleman that I did not receive any noodles. he then tells me its in the small bag with the soy sauce (which is off to me because I've ordered the hong kong style noodles in the past that also comes with crispy noodles and it comes in a separate large container), giving him the benefit of the doubt I go to the little baggie and find all the condiments and 2 small bags of crispy won ton strips. I told him there are no noodles and only bags of crispy won ton strips. he has the edacity to tell me the crispy won ton strips are the crispy noodles!!! uh no...first off, noodles are noodles won ton strips and won ton strips! two completely different items! Not to mention all their food already comes with this baggie of won ton strips ALWAYS! its nothing special!!!! the fact that this gentleman had the nerve to tell me this, really makes me feel like he is underestimating my intelligence. I will never do business with this company again. If he had apologized and admitted they messed up then I would've been fine because sometimes mix up happens. but to go so far as to insult my intelligence is unforgivable in my opinion. So just a heads up on what you will be dealing with should an issue arise with your food. he did send over a small tiny box of chow mien noodles but it did not make up for the insult nor did it cover the description on what the product came with. I was expecting crispy noodles and instead he sends over a small box of soft chow mein noodles. if I wanted soft chow mein noodles then that's what I would have ordered. this place is on my \"no order list.\""}
{"text":"Really fast service and good food. I ordered for delivery and the estimated time was 45-60 minutes but it arrived to me in just under 30 minutes. The food was really good, I especially loved the won ton soup! Driver was also really nice"}
{"text":"Always great service for dining in and take out. Food is fresh and delicious! I usually get sesame chicken because it's great. The lunch special is a great deal too, I usually get 2 meals out of it."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place if you're looking for super fast, mid-quality Chinese food. I come here around once a week and it's always on point. They never mess up an order, it's always made fresh, and always made fast!! My favorite items as of late are the lettuce wrap appetizer (no mushroom or onion), the bbq pork appetizer, and Kung pao chicken!!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"All the food is delicious every time. I recommend the mongolian beef if you can handle spicey. I ordered the thai chicken salad today.  They told me that they did not have the peanut sauce dressing, after my order arrived, which was disappointing. The location is small and will not accomodate more than 6 parties and 20 ppl. Not the best atmosphere for a date."}
{"text":"Quick down and dirty: Good tasting Chinese food, good prices, close to home, and they deliver.  It's not Wing Lei, but it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky on my Chinese food, just as a disclaimer. Orange chicken was decent, string bean chicken was really good. Broccoli beef was borderline, and the chicken chow mein was bad-it had a really weird flavor. Think I'm gonna keep looking!"}
{"text":"After trying countless Chinese food places in the Las Vegas area, and being disappointed, I stumbled across this one. I love it. I can't say that I've sampled a lot of their menu but honestly they have the best chicken teriyaki I've ever had. I've dined in before and the dining area is nice and clean with pretty decor. Their prices are very reasonable for good Chinese food, their lunch specials end at like 3, & the lunch menu has a lot of variety. Visit this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"China a No No. In a pinch and out of convenience, maybe but otherwise we will go elsewhere. Chicken Chow Mein is so subpar that I will not soon forget. Too many other places in the area (see our other reviews) are so much better."}
{"text":"I have ordered from China A Go Go many times before but always pick up from the location located on Valle Verde. Well since we live closer to this one it's who we had to use for delivery. I was having a lazy Sunday last weekend and figured hey one has to be like the other right? Boy was I wrong! This place was terrible! My orange chicken was the worst i have ever had and that's a lot of orange chicken it's one of my favs! When it came it was all clumped and sticking together as if it were one big glob...there was no taste, very bland and no crispyness what so ever. This is just the beginning I will not continue to bore you but I will not EVER order from this location again. We also had egg foo yung, beef and broccoli and combination chow mein, all were eh I can't even say satisfying.....as much as I dislike Panda Express it would've been more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good, solid Chinese food served fast at a good price.  Lunch specials are a good value."}
{"text":"3 dishes, asparagus chicken, seafood delight, seasons beef. Two appetizers, crab Rangoon, and pot stickers. One plate of steamed rice all for $44. We took home leftovers. Everything came out quick, freshly prepared with fresh ingredients. If you want good, fast, fresh Chinese food this is the place."}
{"text":"Greasy and quick should be the name of this place.. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was drenched in oil.. it was disgusting."}
{"text":"I am always pretty pleased with this location . Although I hardly ever eat inside , I will order for delivery and they are really fast . 

The food is average Chinese Food and I typically will order the same thing Singapore Noodles with Egg Rolls and Pork Pot Stickers ! The driver is always nice and prompt ! There are a few locations in town and sometimes they can be a little messy inside !"}
{"text":"This place for some reason always tastes different like it depends on the cook I guess!  But it's always good!!  Their house chicken is so good and food is always hot upon arrival!"}
{"text":"This place is so welcoming. Love the calming Chinese music. Love the employees. They are so friendly and caring toward their customers. There's this one guy named Chen. He's a young cool guy with glasses that is super chill and often asks to refill your water at the right time.

Food is amazing by the way."}
{"text":"The food was good kinda mad it took 2 hours for delivery to get our food .. And all they said was sorry. And didn't care our food was cold had to reheat it and the bags were all a mess full of Sauer"}
{"text":"Great quality Chinese food. Not too greasy and flavorful unlike many of the Chinese restaurants around."}
{"text":"Excellent food always hot and fresh. Fast delivery service . my family is hooked. We love this place. Great prices and friendly service . We eat here at least once a week. 

Right off of the 215 and Valle Verde they are worth the drive for sure."}
{"text":"Usually, I get amazing food at this location. The last two times have been the worse ever. There quickly going down hill here. The food was again over cooked and items missing . There was an underage child working behind the counter and bringing out food."}
{"text":"I liked the chow mein, the noodles were really good but a little too garlicky.  If I ordered it again, I would just have the shrimp in it and not  the beef.  The beef was a little too spongy for me.  The Kung pao chicken had way too many nuts.  The egg roll was not my favorite, I've had much better.  The food was cooked fresh, which was nice.  Just okay.  Good for a quick meal at home."}
{"text":"Ordered to go and they were super friendly! They gave me a cup so I could have a drink while I was waiting. Once I picked up my order, the guy at the counter let me know that they even included some complimentary Chinese donuts in there! The donuts were delicious and so is their walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"I usually love the egg rolls and the soup but today is not cutting it. I'm sorry china a go go but place your workers wear hairnets or some type of head wear. I didn't appreciate my egg roll hair"}
{"text":"Meh- so many Chinese takeout places in Vegas, this one isn't the best.

Lemon chicken has a hefty amount of meat (looked like three pieces pounded out, fried, and sliced) but the lemon sauce wasn't that great, didn't pack as much of a lemony punch as usual.
Won ton soup had a ton of meat also, but the won tons were falling apart. Soup was packed with meat, veggies, and soggy won ton wrappers.

Also ordered a milk tea boba. Not sure if it was overcooked or old, but boba was falling apart. Tea was fine, but ended up tossing the drink.

Good value for the prices, I guess? But quality is lacking."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant,  good food from what I have tried so far,  fast delivery and friendly service.  I don't eat Chinese food very often,  but this is one of the best places to get it in South Las Vegas for takeout"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food is really good everything is made fresh. Been to dozens of places in California and the kitchen is always hidden but not this place. Love everything I order."}
{"text":"It's good chinese take out, nothing special or different than other places. Kung Pao chicken isn't very spicy"}
{"text":"I order chicken fired rice at least once a week. I'm addicted to it.  They're extremely quick on deliveries."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is fantastic. I eat here at least 2-3 times a month. Price is slightly higher than average but its worth it."}
{"text":"So many great options! We chose the personal dinner. For around $11 you get soup an egg roll fried rice and choice of meat. Smells great!"}
{"text":"I once recommended this during lunch...only to arrive while it was still under construction.  My bad!  When China A Go Go (CAGG) finally opened up, the pervious mistake was not repeated thanks to the oracle that is yelp.  Inside we went and were warmly greeted.  This has not changed in all the other future visits....warm and friendly greetings.

CAGG appears to be an order at the counter sort of establishment, but this not the case.  CAGG kindly ask you to have a seat and you are treated to friendly service while sitting.  They have awesome lunch specials ranging from $6.45-$7.35) until 4:30!  What really knocked my socks off was rice or chow mien. Half rice and half chow mien, if you wish...or all rice or all chow mien.  It's up to you!  Sometimes I have even been treated to a complimentary soup or a couple of doughnuts, BONUS!!

Everything from orange chicken to boba Thai tea.....pure awesomeness!   CAGG is quick to establish a relationship with it's guests.  This is somewhat of a rarity in Vegas.  CAGG, I am yours!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not great! The chow mein is kind of bland and the sauce for the dumplings had absolutely no flavor! I am very disappointed in the food! The portion size was amazing because they gave me a ton! Just wish the food had more flavor to it! Will I go back? I don't know!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it food was speedy and very delicious. I had the pad Thai noodles I got them med spicy but next time I'll get spicy. My kids got the kids orange chicken meal which comes with white rice. Overall the food was awesome and inexpensive. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about China a go go so I decided to give it a try for myself. The location is quite small and it wasn't the cleanest not the dirtiest Chinese restaurant I have been to. The prices were pretty good especially if you go during their lunch special. I'll be back again probably to get food to go or eat there to take advantage of their lunch special. Only 3 stars due to the large amount of grease that was on the food and that the place was not too clean. If I was basing the rating on food taste only without the oily issue I would give 4 stars. My advice, is to go during lunch time to take advantage of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Nice little appetizers in the beginning and nice esthetic and room set up :) +yummy food"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the staff here is super friendly!  So 5 stars there.
I ordered the personal dinner.. opened my soup first and on the bottom I found what looks to be a small piece of some kind of blue wrapper. 
Moved on to the dish which I was pleasantly surprised with the size.. but then quickly disgusted/disappointed to discover a black hair in plain sight. 
Unfortunately I live in summerlin and stopped on my way home so I couldn't take it back."}
{"text":"Been going here for 10 years.  I think this restaurant has actually gotten better the past few years.  Food is prepared much more consistently I have noticed.  We love the salt and pepper shrimp, Mongolian beef and new checked noodle soup. 

Finally they have online and mobile ordering."}
{"text":"Completely awful. Ordered the pad thai and the chicken was under cooked and the noodles tasted terrible. Not to mention it's not cheap. Do not go to this place!"}
{"text":"I had the kung pao chicken fried rice egg flower soup it was hot and spicy just the way I like it"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to do take out or eat in about once a week from this China a Go Go. Since then we saw a story on the news about chicken being left outside. We will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Just plain not very good delivery time was ok price was ok.Just not very good."}
{"text":"This place gives you the best bang for your buck. The service is great, and the foood is very tasty"}
{"text":"Ok so I don't want to be the party pooper but truthfully food isn't great and prob won't order again :/ at least from the delivery"}
{"text":"Food is average at best (suspect chicken) so we drive out of the way to get better, the wonton soup is good"}
{"text":"The food tastes good but they always forget something in my order whether its the Hot mustard I ask for or the extra soda I wanted added in.    

When you order $40 in food or more and they tell you its going to be a 20-30 min wait I feel the least they could do is offer you a free soda while you wait, even Arby's does that...

I suppose my biggest complaint is that 3 times I have eaten here now and gotten sick all night from it.

The first time I figured that maybe it was just me, I have health issues and thought, well, sometimes food causes problems and sometimes the same food, the same restaurant even does not and I let it go.

The next time a friend of mine brought me some take out and I did not ask where from, she has pretty good taste in places and I was sick all night long--I did not find out actually from where the food came from till last night when I had them for what I thought was a 2nd try and once again, spent the night sitting on the throne of doom.

As someone who eats out both breakfast and dinner 3+ times a week, I have been to a lot of wonderful and not so wonderful restaurants and won't lie, I have had much better and will not take any more chances with this place again!

And for the record, I had Chinese food last week at Galanga Thai on Windmill and Las Vegas Blvd, delicious and did not get sick.    :o/"}
{"text":"This place is not that good.  The soup had a funky taste. Have had much better Chinese food other places, the only thing good was that the food came out fast."}
{"text":"I have tried a number of Chinese restaurants since moving here. I have learned that there are very specific differences between authentic Chinese, New York Chinese and Chicago Chinese. Being from Chicago. I think this is closest to what I like as a quick take out after a busy day. I will say, I'm not crazy about the egg rolls I like big, thick egg rolls. And the pot stickers are a bit doughy. I always order the Beef with ginger and onions. Soups are very good. Again, everything is good and consistent. Not a place to stay and eat in. The restaurant is a bit cluttered. The staff is always nice. And we always have coupons, a plus. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, it was delivered fast (20minutes) and very hot, the individual dinner was more than enough for two with leftovers.  Crab Rangoons are very good."}
{"text":"I can really say this place is bomb when it comes to Chinese food, I have ate in so many Chinese places in Vegas and not been satisfied. I suggest you try this place out, you won't regret it. My sister suggested to come eat here and our whole family went, we pick this place now when we are in the mood for some Chinese"}
{"text":"There food is great. There employees are awesome. They get you served quickly and there delivery is fast and food is always hot and fresh!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten several times there and the food is always wonderful. I usually get the Garlic Shrimp and it is amazing with plenty of Shrimp. The lunch special portion is enough for two meals. And the Staff are always very courteous and helpful!"}
{"text":"Most patrons complain about poor service, but I need to say I'm rating them very low because of excessive service interruptions...seriously!  First, she brings those pasty fried strips with the red sugar sauce, then takes my order, returns with the food and no table settings or napkins.  I'm not the type of person to be rude, I actually try harder to be patient, so I know it's not my attitude toward anyone.  But patience was a bit stretched with the further trips to my table. How many times can you ask if everything is okay? It became a game when at least 4 of them came to my table a total of 12 times since I sat down.  And all I had was a measley, pedestrian cashew chicken lunch special, after the usual lunch time.  There was nothing exceptional about the food,  which I expected based on prior reviewers, but I just needed a place to sit after hours of shopping.  And a place to work on other reviews.  So many unnecessary interruptions...think I'll go to Panda where the food is a touch better and nobody harasses the diner looking for a little solitude and productive down time.  Really disappointed with this ludicrous experience."}
{"text":"Tonight I received the worst service and cold food from this place. I will never order from here again. I order thru the yelp app and basically they took over an hour to deliver my food. Not only was it cold but I received the wrong dish. I was not going to make a big fuzz about it but when the eat 24 guy told me the cook had to help deliver food because they were slam and short staff I was worry. They then offer a $5 credit and apologize but minutes later they said oh no we can give you a free order of Rangoon but you have t spend over $40. Wth!!! I will never buy food here. The food was deliver very late and cold therefore greasy. China A Go Go remember you are not the only choice around and you don't want to end up like dragon wok OUT OF BUSINESS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Very cheap food and big portions.  I went in to get a quick lunch and the cashiers are super friendly. After I came out of the bathroom, they had my water, soup and complimentary appetizers laid out on the table. I sat at another table because I thought the setup was for someone else, but they kindly directed me to the table with all of the food setup already!  I had the lemon chicken entree for 5.95. It came with a ton of chicken, fried rice, and chow mein. It was not overly oily and the chicken was both soft and crispy. When I left the cashier even said he will see me soon. Excellent food and customer service for the price."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to grab Chinese food on the way home.  I have always been pleased with the quality and the taste."}
{"text":"The food is great, price is reasonable, good size serving and the workers are friendly! A great place to satisfy that \"Chinese food\" cravings!"}
{"text":"Always been good food everytime I go. Fast service nice people..prices are excellent...
It's a good meal ...rather then paying those high prices for poor food on the strip and prices.."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place, we were looking for a new Chinese place to try and chose this one. We walked in and I was really impressed with their customer service, really friendly and gave us free drinks while we waited and added free ragons as well! Food was great, seemed fresh and we will def be back!"}
{"text":"Gotta admit I'm pretty impressed with this chain. Now living in Las Vegas there are tons of choices to eat for Chinese food. I haven't ordered the nice looking stuff but my body was feening for Eggplant. Well, Lo and Behold, they had eggplant and tofu on their spicy menu. Eggplant in real life it looks disgusting, I gotta admit it's not the greatest presentation. It even feels disgusting in your mouth because it's slimy. But if you close your eyes and imagine that you are in heaven, you will find that Eggplant tastes amazing. Of course the secret is getting rid of the bitterness by adding salt and letting it sit so that the bitterness comes outside.

Back to the review, this dish is off the friggin chain. For 9 bucks you get something healthy and your body feels refreshed the next day. Tofu was a bit small compared to the eggplant but no big deal. 

I totally recommend this dish for those that want something different from your regular Chinese Veges..

Beware of eating the red peppers though. Tread lightly if you aren't a fan of spicy."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service.  Food was very good.  Three of us ordered one cashew chicken and one walnut maple shrimp.  Just the two meals.  It was more than enough for us.  The shrimp were large and plentiful.  No shortage of cashews on the other dish either.  Ample food and good quality.  For the price this dinner was an extraordinary value.  Without asking they also brought us piping hot fried dough balls dusted with sugar.  Not sure what they are called, but it was a nice touch and they were a free addition to the meal.  Not fancy, but clean and well run while we were there at 6:00pm on a Saturday.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food...their egg rolls, chicken chop suey and chicken friend rice are amazing!! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Had hi hopes cuz it's right close to my house. Possibly the worst Chinese I've ever had.. Everything smelled of fish.. The beef was not even edible.. Should be called china-a-no-no.."}
{"text":"Finally a solid Chinese take out in this area! Dragon Wok across the street literally serves dog meat, so anything would be a step up from that, but China Go Go is pretty awesome. They have a wide selection of different Asian options and the wait is usually pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"If you want to pay an arm and a leg for some mediocre Chinese food, than this is the place for you. Maybe I ordered on a bad night, but you know what they say about first impressions. I ordered a small chicken and broccoli, no rice. The total was $12. Yes, $12 for a little container of chicken and broccoli. The chicken was tough, and the broccoli was a bit under cooked (even though I asked to have it well done) but, edible. The sauce was good, but as a whole, it just wasn't there. I've also run in for just rice, and it was pricey for a container of plain white rice. Maybe I'll have to give it another whirl and re-review, but as of now, this is not on my go-to list."}
{"text":"On top of it AND very clean! The vegi soup is perfect! The orange shrimp, chicken served on arugula is fantastic. Even if it has a strange orange color!Pricing fair.
Clean and fresh."}
{"text":"Ok, so the hot and sour soup has me in its clutches. Huge chunks of real seafood (!!!!) and just the right amount of spice; so good, I have come back for it 2 days in a row.

The lunch special was ginormous portions but I'd probably ask for no noodles next time. The egg drop soup was tasty. The dining room isn't very pleasant: very loud with tv blaring news, open kitchen, generic decor... I'll be taking my soup home from now on. Skip the crab rangoon (just tastes like grease with very little filling). 

And yet another Vegas restaurant that uses evil styrofoam. Even though I ordered to dine in, it was all still served in styrofoam. Why does no one in this town care about the environment? It is illegal in some states!!"}
{"text":"Food there is always good. I've been there several times for lunch. I always order the General Tso chicken lunch special. The cream Ran goons are delicious"}
{"text":"Not bad food not bad service. I enjoy their honesty when they are out of something. Boba Tea is to die for."}
{"text":"Compared to every other location this one is by far my favorite! The staff is so friendly and go above and beyond to give great service!"}
{"text":"Go to for to go. Strange giving a fast food place so many stars but they have genuinely good wonton and sweet-sour soup. Lettuce wraps are good also. You have all the same generic options but it's fast, cheap, they deliver and are in a convenient spot. Really fulfills all my needs. So don't think I'm calling it gourmet, but in its category I'd say this place is one of the best."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but good experiences here, always fresh. The orange chicken and Mongolian beef are quite good, as well as all the egg rolls and wontons. I wish they had a little more selection, but I'm just knit picking. All in all this is a solid choice for Togo or delivery Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great service great food even better location thanks for coming our way. The customer service is first rate, they take the time to review all the options. I seem to forget what I liked so much last time, they listen and figure it out every time. Love them!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a neighborhood Chinese spot. I love the fact that they have an online ordering system.1000x better than Panda Express."}
{"text":"Great food, service and friendly stuff. We ordered salt and pepper pork chop and we love it. We also tried their thai tea and lychee slushie which was really good! A must try!"}
{"text":"Great food. Cooked to order 
Ordered on Yelp , but they didn't have my order in the system . No problem . I just reordered on spot.
I love fresh food rather than food under burger lamps! 
I ordered fresh salt & pepper shrimp .
& chicken fried rice 
10 mins before closing . Employees did not give me any grief & were still friendly ."}
{"text":"Good beef chow fun and huge portions... Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  So far I have had the Broccoli Beef, and the Hot Garlic Chicken.  Both were very good, and the portions were enough to feed me twice.  Prices are also pretty good, with lunch specials around 6 bucks.  If you eat in, you get free soup as well.  Ive been here a few times now, and the food is always good, and always feeds me several times.  I could never eat the lunch special in one sitting.  Also, the prices are very cheap.  
Overall I am pretty happy with this place and will certainly be going again and again."}
{"text":"Ive only been to this location once, but have been to China a GO GO in general many time.  I love the food here and the portions are amazing.  For less than $7 I can order a meal that will literally feed me 2-3 times.  I normally give a 5 star rating for China A GO GO but this one is only a 4 star from my one experience.  The reason for 4 stars is simply because the food wasn't up to the expecations I have from eating at the other ones around the valley.  I ordered my usual favorite which is the Mongolian Beef.  Usually this will come pretty spicy which is what I love.  This time around my dish did not come with ANY hot peppers in it at all.  I am sure I coudl have asked for some, but I didn't feel I needed too after eating this same dish at least 10 times and always getting spicy hot peppers in them.  Aside from this one mistake the place was the same as usual.  They have great lunch specials and if you eat in you get to have the awesome soup they make too."}
{"text":"The main dish tasted great. Sweet and sour chicken. And broccoli beef were great. The service very friendly and attentive. The only thing that turned me off was the smell of the lo mien noodles was like really bad freezer burn and the texture of the rice was very strange. Almost like minute rice.  Very odd.   The egg rolls were good and sweet and sour was good."}
{"text":"Food is decent, resturant is clean but there's this one lady that is always there who is mean but nice like fake nice. For some reason I feel like I'm getting food from a hostile place and I don't like it. I'm not sure if she is owner or not but it's a weird vibe.

 I like their Chinese chicken salad a they give you a great portion of food. I'm not too crazy about the baby springs they put in it mix with the ice burg I would suggest requesting ice-berg only I know I know its weird but trust me, with the baby springs it give it a funky flavor. The crispy chicken that comes with it is so good they give you a big serving of the dressing which is also so good but can be a bit sweet for others. So other then that for the most part their other food is pretty good. Priced ok and fast service just not the friendliest."}
{"text":"i like china-a-go-go.  i haven't been to the ones in henderson, but there's one on durango accross the street from Sonics & it's decent.  

personally love the salt & pepper pork or squid & walnut prawns..
they aren't shady when it comes to the prawns too..  

their friendly over the phone and prompt when they deliver.  
it's definitely a delivery spot we can count on being good."}
{"text":"Love this place! I go at least once a week! I always get the string bean chicken, egg rolls and the crab rangoons! The service here is friendly and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Typical Chinese take out.  Not amazing but not horrible.  Adequate and better than Panda Express for sure."}
{"text":"100% authentic white boy Chinese food. The place is clean and I like the open kitchen. It's always a little creepy when you walk into a Chinese place and they are passing tickets through a little window to the kitchen. 

The staff is super nice, helpful and friendly. My order was ready pretty quick too. I'll definitely be back.

If you're looking for a life changing Chinese food experience from a strip mall. Keep those feet movin down that street."}
{"text":"Constantly good. I have been getting take out once a week and never had any issues with my food or orders."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to China A Go Go and I'm not sure whether I'll be coming back. The chinese dishes on the menu are decent, but steer clear of any Thai items. They just not good. I ordered a pad thai and it tasted more like lo mein, with none of the Thai spices. And I really think they should have better people taking orders in the front. I ordered a chicken fried rice, but didn't get it, and I ordered a chicken and shrimp pad Thai, where I ONLY got shrimp and no chicken. There are too many Chinese take-outs for them to be making mistakes like this."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out so we wouldn't miss the Golden Knights. Great service and was very fast. Will be back."}
{"text":"Was actually pretty impressed with the food here. It was much much better than I thought it would be. So good on ya! I'm actually kind of craving it right now or maybe I just really want some Chinese food. Regardless, I'm definitely going again sooner than later."}
{"text":"Many others who reviewed this place seem satisfied if not pleased. Running a small business is brutal so I wish them well."}
{"text":"Mango and Strawberry Smoothie with boba. I am used to a family owned boba cafe and have only had boba there because I am so picky. After taking a recommendation from the cashier they made a delicious smoothie with boba! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and VERY good food! The chicken chow mein, the honey walnut shrimp, and the broccoli and beef are a DEFINITE MUST!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town most authentic and better taste!  Now with delivery!  My favorite chow neon as well their sesame beef"}
{"text":"I had my heart set on Chinese from China Go Go got in there to pick up my order while I'm waiting to be waited on I witness a employee who is HANDLING food scratching like he has fleas.Scratching his head and back. And NO he did NOT wash his hands.I had to tell another employee to tell him to wash his hands.And YES I cancelled my order.I am grossed out and currently starving.I guess a sandwhich and chips is dinner today.I will not be eating there anymore."}
{"text":"Great food. I usually go for lunch and they are packed. I just wish they would offer dinner specials like they do at lunch instead of using the same tired traditional Chinese restaurant dinner specials.

Why does the cost of Chinese food triple after 5PM anyway?"}
{"text":"This is our place for Chinese food.  Always delivered hot and fast. I'm usually not a fan of egg flower soup but they add corn and it is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is really good , they have really good lunch specials which is nice . they're always pretty fast and friendly and the food always full of flavor . This is great place to go for a quick bite during lunch hour or for dinner ."}
{"text":"toda la comida aqui esta deliciosa y muy buen servicio y se lo recomiendo, a toda mi familia nos gusta"}
{"text":"Good Chinese take out and also dine inn. I ordered a full serving of orange chicken which was A huge plate of orange chicken with some broccoli on the side and a separate big plate or rice. This order could feed two adults, and possibly 2 adults and a child depending. Huge portion for only $6.95 and also tasted very good. They also give won ton chips with sweet sour sauce for free if you dine in which was interesting. Service  was great as well."}
{"text":"I placed an large order at China GoGo and when placing my order the young lady said ok 15 minutes...well I understand it's Friday night at 6:00pm and dinner time. When I  arrivrd to pay for the order I had to wait 16 minutes while the cashier answeted the phone and proceed to take 2 other orders from the phone. The third call in and cashier  then said hold on so I could pay for my order. 
 However it took over 30 minutes for them to complete my. It was not worth what we paid for the meal."}
{"text":"Not too bad! I live within walking distance from China a Go Go and have ordered from here several times. Even though I usually order to go, the staff is still very friendly. They have online ordering available so that's a bonus. And orders are usually prepared pretty fast, within 10 minutes. 

I've tried the Chicken Fried Rice and Pork Fried Rice ($5.95). They are average...I prefer the chicken. Both are a bit oily, but still good. The Chicken Wings (8 for $6.25) are better, but a bit pricey for what they are. They are delicious though! One order of fried rice and chicken wings should be plenty for two people, or for one dinner and a midnight snack.

TIP: There is plenty of lettuce/garnish/peppers that come with the wings, kind of like a mini salad. It's pretty flavorful and spicy, so I'd recommend saving it with the leftovers and add your own ramen or small bowl of rice. Good for a small snack!

I've lived in this area for nearly 20 years and the same spot has changed ownership/businesses several times (the other businesses weren't that great). I wouldn't mind if this particular business is here to stay. If you live in the same zip code, I'd recommend trying this place at least once."}
{"text":"I ordered some chicken fried rice and some crab rangoons from here on Sunday. The delivery fee wasn't so bad, and there's no minimum (this is all on grubhub), which I really enjoyed. The fried rice was spectacular, very delicious, flavorful, and filling - it was also at a great price! However, at only a few dollars shy, the crab rangoons were pitiful, which is why I omitted the final star. The crab rangoons hardly had any filling, it was primarily just a fried shell, and a small one at that. I'm used to these HUGE chunks of crab rangoon, especially when they are priced at almost the same amount as an order of fried rice or orange chicken. 

Skip the crab rangoons at all costs. Delicious, but very pitiful, pretty much a rip off. Otherwise, great price, great speedy service, and great rice."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheap Chinese I've had thus far in Vegas.  Kung pao shrimp, chicken curry, and egg foo young all perfection.  Dumplings also huge and tasty."}
{"text":"Quick and easy. For a fast-food style Chinese chain the food tastes amazingly fresh. Although I generally only eat Chinese when I have a cold, this is pretty much the only quick Chinese place I go here in Vegas"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Las Vegas. Wouldn't eat any other Chinese food take out. They are always nice and give free stuff!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Place is always clean and staff is friendly. Usually order over the phone for a quick pick up on way home. Pot stickers are great!!! When I get chicken fried rice, always order $2 more chicken and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"So sad, this establishment has really went down hill. The prices were raised and the quality of food and service have went down. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and the staff is always friendly. That's just the place the food is fantastic always on point hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered several entrees all were delicious! The cashier gave us doughnuts which were also delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Your typical sub-par Chinese joint. The workers here were kind of rude.

Giving this place 3 stars and not 2 because I think I'm addicted to their crab rangoons. And also, they deliver!

Would highly recommend crab rangoons and any kind of chow mein because how can you mess that order up? I love me some noodles. Their combination fried rice isn't bad, either. I used the gravy sauce from egg foo young and mixed it in with the fried rice and it was a great concoction. 

Would consider ordering from here if it's for delivery, I guess. Dining in was a \"meh\" experience. It also felt a tad bit on the dirtier side while eating in."}
{"text":"I feel in love with this place everything was fresh and awsome I love this place not many places with fresh food here they male it to ordet . THERE SPICY ORANGE CHICKEN awsome"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times as the food is always pretty good for a decent price. The chicken teriyaki and honey walnut shrimp are definite favorites and the appetizer sampler is a great option for those like me who can never decide on a single starter."}
{"text":"Well I have not gotten sick here and have been here at least a half dozen times; was here today and received great customer service from the cashier and the head chef .  Really appreciated their kindness.  Thank you:)"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW. we just ordered and picked up our dinner. We ordered the family B menu. The Wonton soup was probably The VERY best I have had in years!  Chicken, shrimp, pork and wontons. The Bok Choy were in whole pieces.  Enough for dinner on its own. 

The appetizers of fried shrimp, egg roll and the ragoons were fresh and still very hot. 

The fried rice is true fried rice with pork, shrimp, peas and other yummy ingredients!  

Our dinner was lemon chicken. Gorgeous. My husband had the shrimp and snow peas, extra spicy and extra good. 

Enough for another dinner (except for the soup, that was almost my whole meal). 

It was definitely enjoyable dinner and extremely happy with this find. 

Definitely a do over and over and over!  If you're reading this stop and order already!!!"}
{"text":"Walnut Shrimp to die for!  Whether you dine in, order to go, or have delivery, the Rainbow location gets it right every time.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I needed a Chinese food fix and boy did I get it!!! The place was nice and clean. We ordered four plates... chicken phai tai, beef and broccoli, chicken chow mein, and we got a kids chicken teriyaki plate.  They all tasted good and the portions were absolutely huge!!!! Did I mention the servings were huge!!! This fed four of us and we still managed to take THREE to go boxes loaded with left overs!!! We spent thirty five dollars for all this food plus two drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Amaizing service .I received my order in 20 min and the food was great. I ve been ordering from this location for the past year and I have no complaint."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and found some good dishes that kept me coming back every so often. But whoever is cooking today pretty much flopped - our meals were not good at all. Sorry, we won't be back."}
{"text":"It's slim pickings when it comes to Chinese in southern highlands. This is pretty much it. It's ok, they're friendly and the fried rice is good. The sesame chicken is ok, as is the sweet and sour chicken. Large portions. Does the trick when I'm craving cheap Chinese but I'm too lazy to drive further into town."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped by for a quick lunch not expecting too much. Right when we walked in we were greeted by a friendly server and given a seat. They have lots of great food and super good prices. The service was awesome! My drink ran out and right when I hit the last sip I had a refill waiting. So fast and attentive. Cheaper than Panda and way better quality. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"90% of the time, I order this for delivery to my job.  I've eaten at the restaurant a couple of times and, ehh... I'd prefer the delivery.

They are extremely fast and everything I've tried there has been A-OK to Good.  House Special Chicken is great for lunch, and you can get them to kick the spice up a notch.

Recently, I've been ordering the Mu Shu Chicken and was excited to learn you could get that spicy as well.  The hoisin sauce mixed with the chicken, green onions, bamboo shoots and egg is addictive.  I usually order this and forego the tortillas (it also comes with rice), but I have put the chicken in one and it is still just as tasty.

To make their $10 minimum, I usually order something $9.75 then a can of soda for $1.00.  I rarely drink the soda, but I have coworkers who do so for me it's not a big deal.  Add the $2 delivery fee BUT! I have been very fortunate to find $2 off coupons for Eat24 to utilize when placing my delivery order, which will negate that. More tip love. :)

tl;dr - This is more of a convenience place for me but the food is tasty."}
{"text":"This place is what I was looking for when it comes to great Chinese food! Came in ordered sat down and not even 5 min later our food was hot and ready! We ordered the family dinner which is greatly priced, got two entrees shrimp fried rice soup and two wontons and two spring rolls! We had the teriyaki chicken and orange chicken! So fresh and on point! Not to mention the vegetables were cooked perfectly and you can tell everything was fresh. What I liked was you could see they don't use all the grease and oil when cooking everything tasted fresh. Def will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually Order from here a lot, it normal takes 20 mins for them to get here but today when the answered the phone the lady was RUDE!! & Deaf. They took an hour to get here but all in all it was delicious"}
{"text":"Horrible Customer service!!! My Dad politely ask him about the total amount and the cashier responded super rude. Then we needed fo change to a bigger table because we were waiting for more family and she came outside and questioned us in a super rude way why we were changing tables. We ask for the manager or if she was the manager and she didn't wanted to answer. If they don't like their jobs im sorry but thats none of our business. At the end we didn't even ate comfortable..."}
{"text":"Food was bad no flavor waitress didn't understand English bad food bad experience all around the soda was even bad"}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean and the service is always great! I absolutely love the mongolian beef. Could eat that multiple times a week if i had the choice. But it is spicy so be prepared. My kids love the Hunan beef. We visit often, especially during their linch special time as it is very inexpensive."}
{"text":"We ordered and had our food in less than ten minutes. Nice! The orange chicken is way better than Panda Express. Kung Pao Chicken wasn't as spicy as I like but I can't complain with all the crisp vegetables in there. It was yummy! Egg rolls and veggie fried rice very good also. I got 1/2 servings which was a lot of food for the money. So glad they are so close!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT CHINESE FOOD THAT DELIVERS
I have gone to this location on Valle Verde for years and have loved this place. It's a great VERY FAST Chinese Food restaurant that serves very good food. Plus they deliver!

Last week I got my favorite dish. Not only did it come out in minutes, but they brought it to my table... they don't have waitstaff!

There is a large menu with lots of combinations but I've found that you can pretty much MAKE UP WHATEVER YOU WANT. For example, instead of the CHICKEN AND EGGPLANT or TOFU AND EGGPLANT I just get CHINESE VEGETABLES AND EGGPLANT. It is by far my favorite dish of theirs.  You can get HALF ORDERS (Most Whole Orders are $9, half orders are $6). Most lunches come with a combo setup including EGG DROP SOUP.

VERY FAST and VERY, VERY HOT!!!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT CHINESE FOOD THAT DELIVERS
NEW WEST SIDE LOCATION (TROP & HUALAPAI)
I have gone to the location over on Valle Verde for years and have loved this place. It's a great VERY FAST Chinese Food restaurant that serves very good food. Plus they deliver! And now they have one by my new home on the west side! Woo-hoo!

There is a large menu with lots of combinations but I've found that you can pretty much MAKE UP WHATEVER YOU WANT. For example, instead of the CHICKEN AND EGGPLANT or TOFU AND EGGPLANT I just get CHINESE VEGETABLES AND EGGPLANT. It is by far my favorite dish of theirs. 

Just today I had the chicken and eggplant and it was very good. My girlfriend had the tofu and eggplant and it was so hot that I almost got done eating before hers was cool enough to eat. This would be great for a delivery dish, as it would hold it's heat for a long time. Oh, and I think the lady who brought us our meals winked at me!

You can get HALF ORDERS (Most Whole Orders are $9, half orders are $6).

Most lunches come with a combo setup including EGG DROP SOUP."}
{"text":"China a go go on Ann road is terrific! The food is always fresh and the order is accurate.Food has good flavor and as close to back east as you are gonna get.The garlic shrimp is delicious! They don't nickel and dime you to death and charge for every little thing.Always a winner.Other places around town charge for extra sauce......when there wasn't enough to begin with.These guys are the real deal.Super fast delivery!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery took well over an hour. Food was lukewarm and below my expectations based on reviews. Stomach was upset the entire evening afterwards. Not sure if it was the food or just something didn't agree with me. I was really hoping this was going to be great since it is very close to my home. But after this experience I probably will not be ordering again from here."}
{"text":"China A Go Go is a China A No No. Over thirty minutes late. Half the order was wrong. I had to call three times, and the quality of mediocre. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Fast Fast Fast.  Seriously, this food is ready for you in an amazingly fast amount of time.  I always find it comical that chinese take-out places tell you that your order will be ready in \"ten minutes\" regardless of what or how much you actually order.  China A GoGo really does have the order ready in ten minutes.  I timed it.

Aside from being fast, the food is really good and the portions really are large.  I've had the same item a few times and noticed that the flavor varies slightly.  Last time, my meal was a little heavy on the ginger.  Normally this would be a negative, but in this case it tells me that someone is using fresh ginger and actually adding it to the dish.  For how fast and cheap this place is, it's comforting to know that fresh ingredients are being used.

Unfortunately I haven't tried more than two or three items from the menu.  Yet.  I have definitely found my go-to Chinese take-out, so I'm sure I will sample the whole menu in no time at all."}
{"text":"Looking for a great takeout place that delivers? Check out this spot! We live nearby and have received coupon flyers prior. We finally decided to try and were super happy with our choice! They have family dinner specials that easily feed 4-5 people or are enough leftovers for two meals for 2 people. Check your mail for your coupon flyer, then call and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and the customer service was even better! Alisa was on point, courteous and attentive from the very moment I opened the door! It's very hard to find this kind of service anywhere, anymore, but she got it nailed! My sincere thks! You made my day! Keep smiling & projecting your super attitude!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up right next to me. It's very convenient to have great quality Chinese food next to you.  The service is excellent and good tastes so good. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas I I had the teriyaki chicken and my drink was water it was pretty good I am very pleased thanks!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area. If you want Chinese, this is a really fine choice. I highly recommend family meal B as it comes with tons of food. The portions are very generous as well."}
{"text":"First time ever experiencing this place and i may say their honey walnut shrimp is super good!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat authentic Chinese food. They have big plates .large servings. And they have great costomer service."}
{"text":"Big portion, cheap price, decent taste.
It's a fine choice for a quick filling lunch."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing and the service is great. I take my family here at least once a week and its always a hit. Looking for some great Chinese food look no further go and get some."}
{"text":"I ordered a teriyaki chicken plate ($10)  then paid $2 for delivery and received nearly all veggies , I love vegetables but that's not what I ordered or expected . If I wasn't at work I would've drove to return it and gotten my money back ."}
{"text":"They make me my general Tso each time even tho it's not on the menu. Had to deduct a point for the two times I ordered mixed dishes and requested not meats but seafood and they have come with chicken both times."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food at a decent price.. Very friendly employees and large portions of food. The lunch specials are a great deal and they offer a large variety of Boba flavors..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the BEST service for people with food allergies. They are really accommodating towards my gluten allergy and will even have the chefs check the ingredients on all the sauces. Food is always fresh and delicious. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered over the phone and the gentleman was very polite. We ordered the shrimp and snow peas which was delicious. The beef curry was also really good, maybe just a little skimpy on the beef. The cream cheese wontons were good. They also gave us an order of fried donuts for free. Delivery guy asked to see the card which made me happy they care about security. Food came quick and hot. Overall, it was a good experience and we will order again in the future."}
{"text":"This place was so good. Closest mac salad I could find to my grandmas too. Sad it's not there anymore, really wanted to take my boyfriend. :-("}
{"text":"I just ate the food for the first time. This place is legit, This is really good food. My whole family liked it and with my picky crew that's hard to do. The delivery was pretty fast too, about 30-40 min wait. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Can't figure out all the negative reviews.  It's Chinese takeout guys (aka home of the $10 lunch combo)... not an authentic 5 star dining experience.  I order dinner for my family here about once a month.  They always remember me and even throw in some free spring rolls and fried noodles. We haven't gotten sick once despite the other reviews.  Not the greatest but never a complaint...  They deliver a consistent product at a very reasonable price and never had to wait longer than 15 minutes.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"China A Go Go is one of those to-go Chinese spots. Of course, you can eat there as well. When I'm in the mood for take out and want to catch up with Netflix, this is my jam.

I have been to the other location on Lake Mead near Boulder Hwy and it was more of a sit down with a sushi bar. I just happened to stumble upon this location when I went grocery shopping at Smith's, which is in the same shopping center. I saw on the Yelp app that you can order your food ahead of time (I like that!) but since I was so close anyways I just decided to order in person. 

-Sesame beef: LOVE! It's been a while since I've had this dish where it was fried and crunchy. So far this is the only place in LV that does it the way I like it. No soggy beef, please.

-General Tso's chicken: Always happy with General Tso, it's my safe dish at any Chinese restaurant. 

-Chow Fun: Flat noodles are my favorite! Ask them to make it spicy!

The portions were typical of any take out Chinese place. Overall, I will be back again."}
{"text":"I really love this place lol if you just looking some where to eat and hang with friends this is the place . I LOVE THE BOBA here !!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service here is not the best. I ask them a question about their menu and the guy kept rolling his eyes like if he was annoyed or something. Didn't feel like the service was good nor does it deserve a higher rating."}
{"text":"Seems like a lot of the reviews are a bit dated. Restaurant AND kitchen are clean (if you're from NJ/NYC like me, you'd call it immaculate). More than satisfied for the cost. 

$6.55 for bbq pork, veggies, and brown rice. Exceeded my expectations. Food came out SUPER quick and cashier was friendly. Found my go-to spot when in a rush and in need of some cheap eats."}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected but I'd return here before going to Panda Express! 
A very large selection menu...portions are very generous and plentiful...and the food is very good! 
Combination chow mein noodles with chicken, shrimp and pork...walnut shrimp served on a bed of (sugared) lettuce and pot stickers...we couldn't finish it all..good thing it's all in to-go boxes cos we will be taking the left overs home! 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A quick way to do Chinese! However quality not very consistent with different location having slightly different taste."}
{"text":"When you have a Chinese food craving you are looking for something specific. Sometimes you just want to cure that hangover with something greasy or experience something finer. China A Go Go is that perfect place in between when you're looking for tasty Chinese food on the go. 

For a family of 4 adults and 3 children, we ordered quite a bit using the Yelp app's delivery option, Yelp Eat24. We easily plugged in our order, received a free Crab Rangoon in the process from a deal they were having, and added tip all at the same time. Using the app was so convenient, especially since our order was so large. End are the days of over complicating a take out order!

Within the hour our delivery guy arrived and our order was perfect. The only hiccup was that en route the Thai Boba Tea had spilled, but our driver surprised us with a return trip with a fresh tea at no extra cost. Talk about amazing and thoughtful customer service!

Overall our food was delicious and without any faults that I could note. The Mongolian Beef, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Combination Noodle specifically was so tasty I couldn't wait for seconds.

I couldn't rate this Chinese spot enough for their food quality and customer service! We were so pleased with everything from how easy ordering was to sitting down and enjoying our meal. Definitely they will be an establishment we'll eat from here on out while in LV!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend eating here. They recently were shut down with over 40 health code violations & demerits. I read about this restaurant's violations & was not only disgusted by the way they handled their food but by the way they handled receiving the demerits; they seemed more concerned that they were caught rather than the well-being of the customers that were eating there. I was so concerned & appalled I came here to write this review, hope it helps avoid someone getting food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I don't like being lied to...who does.  I called ahead to ask them if they use MSG and was told \"no.\"  I asked again, \"are you sure, because I get headaches after eating MSG?\"  The lady on the other end snaps back \"no MSG!\"

Well, the lady working the counter lied to me as I still have a headache from eating lunch there yesterday. It's so bad that I feel compelled to write this review as I cannot sleep with this headache.  I only get headaches after consuming large quantities of the garbage, which is rare since I take precautions to avoid it the best I can and haven't experienced anyone else lying about it.  Hell...even a Vietnamese restaurant admitted to \" just a little bit...just a little bit\" recently which I appreciated, yet avoided.

Rather than being honest and not making a sale, China A GoGo decided to be deceptive and in return will get my honest review about the cleanliness of their restaurant and quality of their food.

So against my better judgement, I ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch with Hot & Sour Soup...not to go.  The table I sit at is sticky prior to my food arriving.  The soy sauce and Sriracha on the table have crusty residue on the tops of them.  Even though I chose to dine in, my food arrives in a styrofoam to go box...the soup in a styrofoam cup.  The lady plops it down in front of me and I see noodles hanging out of the box laying on the sticky tabletop.  I pull the noodles that have contacted the table out putting them on my napkin.  I'm given only 1 napkin, a plastic fork...no chopsticks.

The Mongolian beef wasn't at all spicy or seasoned for that matter.  Not a lot of meat, but a ton or green bell pepper and onion.  A more fitting name would've been Bell Peppers in MSG sauce.  It came with fried rice and some bland brown noodles.  I was expecting it to come with white rice and would've preferred it to.  The fried rice was meatless and flavorless.  The noodles were just as bland, actually more so.  Maybe I should've eaten the noodles hanging off the box that touched the table?  They may have had more flavor after soaking up the table top bacteria.

The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour.  Tons of tofu, no meat whatsoever and close to no bamboo shoots.  A slippery, slimey tofu soup without any crunch is what I got.

Even without the MSG fiasco, I would've rated it 2 stars.  Since I was deceived in the name of a few dollars and am still suffering at 5am the next day, they get 1.  China a NoGo makes Panda Yuckxpress seem like a 5 star dining establishment."}
{"text":"Before I explain my experience here at China A Go Go, let me tell you about what lead me here (I'm writing the review in the restaurant at this very moment). At around 5:30, I ordered dinner at another close-by Chinese restaurant (check out my reviews to see which one) and at 6pm, I was throwing my order out because it was revolting.  I hopped onto Yelp to write a review and then read some reviews for other Chinese joints.

That's how I found China A Go Go and I'm not disappointed!  I don't typically order honey walnut shrimp, but I did this once after it received many good reviews on Yelp.  I also ordered crab rangoon, my personal favorite at almost all Chinese places.  My order total was around $19, which I guess is the going rate around here...

Anyway, they gave me wonton chips while I waited. They were stale, but who cares?  I didn't come here for that.  Literally within ten minutes, I had both of my food items and they were pipping hot! The crab rangoon pops in your mouth and their sweet & sour sauce is pretty good.  The honey walnut shrimp is a large helping of medium- large sized shrimp that don't taste like they were previously frozen and they are pretty thick.  The sauce, although still not my favorite, isn't too sweet and has somewhat of a tang.  I would order both again and will definitely recommend them to friends.

I am a little disappointed that they do not deliver to my address, but I understand!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sort of a Love/Hate feeling towards this place. 

My husband and I love the food. 

We will never order delivery again. After an hour passed waiting we decided to call and the worker gave us the delivery guy's phone number. We called and he said he was at the wrong house...

Another hour passed and still no food. The delivery man stopped answering our calls so, we call the store again. She tries to offer free egg rolls! Egg rolls?!?! After two hours? We overheard her talking to the delivery guy about losing his keys in the background! So, he never left...

So after two hours, being lied to about the delivery guy, we canceled our order. That was that.

Good food, just never order delivery!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE GAVE ME FOOD POISONING. 
There's no doubt that this place was the culprit. I hadn't eaten anything today except for this \"meal\". 

Ordered the Broccoli and Beef lunch combo(came with fried rice, chow mein, and the entree), Mapo Tofu (I don't remember which meat), Pork fried rice, and beef chow fun. 

ALL minimal flavor. It was suffice at the time considering my boyfriend and I were lazy to pick up food and to cook. What a regret that was. 

I've never had food poisoning until this day. ID SUGGEST NOT TO EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I have ordered here a couple of tines. Food has always been fresh, hit and delicious."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Food was delivered within specified time frame st room temp. Im new to this area. It was ok for a first timer"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings, mongolian beef and kung pow hands down.  

mind you I love spicy food.  I always order the food extra spicy and they comply with my requests perfectly.  While i wait they offered me a free soda.  And they have always greeted me with a smile.  

Not to mention they are clean and quick!

They do charge a little bit more for their entrees than other places, but it's well worth it for the service."}
{"text":"I discovered this gem through an internet search. My daughter and I have stopped there a few times and have always been very happy with the food. Tonight we decided to order and have it delivered. The lady who answered the phone was very friendly and helpful and never got annoyed with my questions. She told me it would be about 45 minutes, but was much quicker than that. (Good thing I already had pants on!) The driver was extremely friendly, smiled the whole time, and even gave me a Chinese Scroll Calendar as a gift. Being a vegetarian, I love the menu options I have with them. I keep their menu handy for whenever I have a hankering for some good food. The only suggestion I would have is that they should also offer brown rice. White rice doesn't settle well in my stomach. I LOVE this place!!! I'll be ordering frequently!!!"}
{"text":"Wow the best food I've had in awhile the food was fresh the portion was huge I'm loving this place next time and every time I come to Vegas I have to have it.  I had the Singapore curry noodle without pork it was it was just the bomb."}
{"text":"Super awesome! They pass out some delicious samples sometimes and give large portions."}
{"text":"This is my go to chinese fix for my Moo Shu Pork and Buddha Delight. Other than that everytime I've tried something else... it's been garbage. 

Today took the cake, beef teriyaki bowl was.... fried beef and sauce.... this is not teriyaki."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to pickup fast food Chinese. Portions are really big. Next to the Vons. Fast service. I didn't order much off the menu. I can only really go off of what I ordered.


General Tso's chicken - My favorite of what I ordered. Good size pieces of chicken. Not overly breaded. And pretty good crisp to them

Orange Chicken - Not bad. A lot more bread. Not very crispy. 

Mongolian Beef - Pretty good flavor. Not too bad.


Overall - pretty good, but not favorite fast food Chinese."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly! Restaurant area looks clean. Menu seemed large enough. Rice, veggies, and flavor was nice. The chicken was really poor quality though. It ruined the meal for me, I won't be back. The rest was fine, which is why I give 3 stars. I'll stick to the places with better quality meat."}
{"text":"I love their hot spicy garlic chicken! Spicy and has some amazing mushrooms bursting with flavor!
My kids love their sweet and sour chicken and fried rice.
The hot and sour soup is pretty bomb.
Staff doesn't really care to give good service but hey, it's a fast food Chinese place, and fast is exactly what they are! 
Love the crab rangoons and that spicy garlic chicken FO SHO! 
I've had their crunchy Singapore noodles with gravy save and shrimp and that's pretty bomb too."}
{"text":"For a Chinese takeout place, it's great. Clean, nice workers, good service. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. Different from the usual, and it was good"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the customer service sucks I wouldn't recommend this location the people working there are to slow."}
{"text":"First my 5 stars are based only on the food I ordered for pick up and the service. When I moved here in November I was curious if I could find a Chinese food place that I loved as much as I did back in California. I am not big on a lot of Chinese food but I love chicken fried rice. This is usually how I rate a good Chinese place. I am a picky eater so I have always ordered mine with no vegetables, rice, chicken, and egg only.
China A Go Go is on my way home from work so I thought I would give them a try. I ordered on-line with the special instructions of no veggies and a pick up time of ASAP as I was leaving work in 5 minute and it is about a 5 minute drive away. I was leery of the online ordering but it worked just fine. I arrived at the place and my order was ready and best of all it was correct, No Veggies!!
The best part of all is it tasted exactly like the chicken fried rice I use to get at my favorite place in California. I am a fan of this place and I see a lot more orders in the future. The price was also reasonable."}
{"text":"Pro: very cheap and fast

Con: I took Togo and they stuffed the meat the noodles and rice into on tiny box.  They gave a lot of food but no space in box. By the time I got home it was spilling everywhere and was very messy.  

China a go go please get bigger boxes if you will give a lot of food !

The food was yummy though:). Next time I'll eat at the restaurant though so I will comment on service later on.....To be continued"}
{"text":"4 stars for the fast service, super cheap options, and the nice delivery drivers. 
Today I placed my order with eat24 app a little before they opened at 11 am... and my food arrived at 11:07! They are always on time or early. 

The food is pretty good, the same as most Chinese delivery places but you can't beat the prices here. The delivery charge is only $2 and a lunch combo with a drink and your choice of egg rolls or Rangoon is just under $8. I recommend general tso's or the house chicken, every time I order it's very good. The Orange chicken has been hit or miss... I'm not sure why. The portions are very big, they give enough for two separate meals. 

**Tip for cheap people like me** After the lunch specials end just order from the kids menu. They give you the same amount of food just a lower price lol. (I hope they don't notice)"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch.  I order from my office all the time and they are always on time, always hot, and always exactly what I ordered.  I usually get soup and extra crunch noodles.  They even bring a soup spoon and a little bowl so I don't have to eat out of the giant takeout container.  The only reason I have 4 instead of 5 is because despite explicit direction on the order about half the time my order goes to another building in my business complex.  Overall I love this place."}
{"text":"The food is good, what can I say? I've lived in the valley for the past 10 years, and this place has always never failed to satisfy my appetite. The noodles and rice are always good."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas from LA where we have some great Chinese restaurants. Decided to try this place. When picking up the food wasn't greeted by any staff and attended by a rude woman at the counter. Wasn't a pleasant experience at all.

Finally get home with the orange chicken, fried rice and noodles and honestly I can't even eat it. It's very bland and not good at all. I'm starving but I'd rather save the calories for something else."}
{"text":"Ordered food online from this place for dinner via new Paypal service.  For some reason you are unable to specify delivery this way but that is fine.  PayPal offered $10 to use their Eat24 service so I gave this place a shot.

Food was great.  Order was exactly as I placed on Paypal Shop and food was ready for me right at 4:30pm as specified.

I will definitely be getting dinner for the family again."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food. They make it when you order so it's fresh.  Will come back again. The lady at the register was very nice.  You don't hear that very often from Chinese establishment.  Lol"}
{"text":"the food is good great service and happy employee the lunch special is a good price for the amount of food you but if dine in you get soup too lol"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, of all cuisines I'm probably the least versed in Chinese Food. It's not that I don't like it, that's not the case at all, by my manly physique it can go without say that there are very few things I dislike. I'm just not very adventurous in this avenue of dining. There are the things I like and I'm not very open to swaying away from them.

So here's what I've had from China a Go Go - Sweet N Sour Chicken, Lettuce Wraps, Fried Race, pork stuffed Won Tons, General Tsao Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. Well, now that I typed out that list I just realized that I might be more versed in Chinese dining than the above paragraph said. Whoops...All of the listed items are outstanding. The Honey Walnut Shrimp is absolutely amazing. The shrimp are \"UUUGE\" and the sauce is the perfect amount of sweet. The amount of food you get is amazing. The Lettuce Wraps appetizer is enough to feed 4 hungry hippos. Those two items are by far my favorites on the menu.

Here's the biggest thing, and not to stereotype, but I'm going to, I've found that service can sometimes be less than desirable at Chinese restaurants. This place puts the stereotype to rest. For a fast food-ish type restaurant they were very attentive when dining in. Provided refills. Checked on us numerous times. When ordering to go we asked how many crispy won tons you get on the side because we had 4 people eating, they decided to throw in free pork won tons \"to make sure everyone has enough food.\" Outstanding!"}
{"text":"It's in my neighborhood. Food is okay.  Delivery is quick. In-house service is okay also. Nothing great. It's fast food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good Chinese food, I ordered the Orange chicken and the Mongolian Beef lunch specials which were really cheap and a lot of food.  Recommended if your looking for some quick Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean with casual ambience. 

Food is ok.

Good for Groups

I love there Thai ice tea with BoBa , I order with less ice :).

Economical. Two can easily fill there tummies for 25$ max with BoBa ofcourse.

I like there Chow Fun. I did not like their chow mein though. i found very few shrimp like 4 of them in their Chow fun maybe thats the asian way of saving money :)

Not the best chinese food out there but worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Great service. Fast with drinks.  Came in just for boba today. Was very good.  Food is usually great and quick as well"}
{"text":"Always great service!! Great food and great prices!! I always get the House Special Chicken. The Fried Wontons are great. Make sure to dine in so you get the Egg Drop Soup."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the food. It's always delivery, never dined here. Food is great! Best Chinese on this side of town."}
{"text":"We were new to Las Vegas valley last month and took a chance because we were missing our old Chinese place in Utah.  So happy with our choice! We have ordered again since.  Quick service, easy ordering and delicious food!! We decided we have found our new favorite."}
{"text":"I would give it a negative 5 star if I could. Worst Chinese food ever!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from CAGG a bunch of time and usually get the same thing, the won ton soup or egg drop soup, garlic chicken, the peppered chicken wings and the house special fried rice.
I have never had a bad dish from them and they are super quick when you place an order for pick up, yeah delivery can be a bit long about 45 mins to an hour but I know that so I order early enough in advance.
My favorite is by far the peppered chicken wings, super crispy and just the right amount of heat.
For a small local hole in the wall I'm a fan."}
{"text":"China a go go they smile at you and make fun of all the Americans in Chinese.  They were laughing at this lady because they thought she was over weight. 
I told them I can understand you and I said it in Chinese.  Instead of feeling sorry or guilty because they were busted they got angry at me for understanding what they were saying about their customers. 
This is the type of place that will call you \"number one customer\" while they spit in your rice. China a go go well you can a go go right back to China !"}
{"text":"RUDEST FUCKING PEOPLE I HAVE EVER MET!  I Never coming back again. I came in and was not greeded. When I was telling them my order the guy looked mad the whole time. I asked for a boba drink and he answered rudely \"We arent making any right now.\" I was the only one in the restaurant so when my food was ready they asked me to see the receipt. I put it in my big purse so they were getting mad because i couldnt find it. Really? Smh"}
{"text":"Very good and fast service! First time here but I was pleasantly surprised because I am picky about my Chinese food, tried many places in Vegas but this is by far the yummiest and will be our new favorite. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed an excellent New Year's Eve lunch! We dined in; the service was great; our order was served promptly, & came out of the kitchen hot & just as we ordered. We had the lunch special, as well as hot & sour soup, & chicken lettuce wraps. We got some donuts @in the house\", & they were sinfully delicious! We had plenty for a take-home box. I recommend this spot if you're in the area, or need a break from shopping."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, they are quick and polite. Only thing wish they would give you or offer sauces without having to ask."}
{"text":"Yummy for the tummy. Great price, great food and great service. Always busy. Hot and sour soup great for a rainy day!"}
{"text":"They forgot my order, while 3 people that order after me got their order first and I only order one dish! I walk out after setting their for 45 mins! They will give you their gressy chinese chips while waiting!"}
{"text":"It's odd that no one has reviewed this place.  They advertise in all the local papers.  We have been going here for the entire four years that we have lived here.

Although there are a few cramped tables they basically specialize in takeout and delivery.  Most any common Chinese dish can be found here from Chinese Chicken Salad to Walnut Shrimp.  We just took out lunch from here (Sweet and Sour Pork and Pork Chow Fun).  OK, it's not the best Chinese food ever, but it is really, really solid food.  I've never had a bad dish.  They pack the sauces separately so that the fried foods don't get soggy.  And they put extra ginger in my Shrimp Chow Fun when I ask for it.  The family running this restaurant are hard working and pleasant.  If you want quick Chinese, DEFINITELY go here."}
{"text":"Good food like always, but horrible cashier. She was a female with broken english. Im all about equality, but someone should have been shadowing her to ensure accuracy. They tend to use this to their advantage (broken english or foreign writing), because when you order substition for items like fried rice, they wont tell you the amount. Typical hustle.

I ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, but was given the black pepper style instead. I told a guy about what the mistake was, he just said sorry and did not attempt to fix the problem."}
{"text":"When our dinner plans fell through, my wife and I were left looking for other options.

She wanted Mexican, so I started looking for a Chinese place nearby. China A Go Go had good Yelp reviews, so I called in my order from the Mexican place she got her food. 

My order of Sesame Chicken was ready in about 10 minutes, it was waiting for me when I got there. The portions were pretty large and the chicken was cooked perfectly, not too crunchy and tasted excellent.

The fried rice was an extra $2.50, which may be normal, but I don't recall paying that much extra for it before.

At any rate, my experience here was excellent and I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Their Chow Fun is super legit! I got the Beef Chow Fun. Kudos to the chef for excellent 'wok hay'!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through grub hub and the delivery was super fast. The food was awesome. Had the general tso chicken and shrimp and lobster sauce. Mmm mmm good"}
{"text":"Cooking on my days off have been a regular routine for me. But lately, I just haven't been in the mood. I blame it on the additional responsibilities I have agreed to take on at work. Gotta feed the boys though and China A Go Go is a lifesaving Chinese restaurant that I've been ordering from for years. It's always takeout or delivery so just a review of the food here. 

1. Fried rice: There's a reason why this is first, I LOVE their fried rice. I sometimes order a whole pan. Reason mostly for the four stars. 
2. Spring rolls: You already know that my 14yr old has to have his spring rolls. Very good, flaky and crispy. 
3. Honey Walnut Shrimp: This is where I first learned that I love this dish.
4. Orange chicken: Family favorite. Great orange flavor. 
5. Chow Mein: Who gets bored eating this? Not us!
6. Crab Rangoon: Needs more cream cheese
7. Wor Wonton Soup: The wonton is always the first to go, the rest are left overs so I only order this occasionally. 
8. HK style noodles: Thumbs up! The gravy is wonderful, yummo. 
9. Boba tea: I prefer Plumeria. 
10. Mongolian Beef: Still looking for my perfect Mongolian beef. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place."}
{"text":"Since I last reviewed this place they've improved the boba situation it seems. They still run out sometimes but usually only on very busy days near the end of the day. Still a good place for sushi and Chinese food on the east side of town imo - I usually get either the Eel Tempura Roll (Eel, cream cheese, cucumbers, Eel sauce, Tempura fried) or the potstickers (at this place they are bigger than most others with a more hearty dough covering, personally I like them better this way but some may not)."}
{"text":"Ok I don't understand why the workers kids are all over the place! Is this a daycare or a restaurant?  Service isn't the greatest either! Leave the kids at home and run this like a eating establishment!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a minus I would. I've been here a few times and every time it's the same \"BAD\". Bad attitude bad food. Cannot stand going to an ethnic restaurant and because you're not from that country they think you don't know what good food is suppose to taste like so they serve you crap."}
{"text":"Out of all the available Chinese joints around Vegas, this is the one to skip. Our delivery showed up over an hour later and was lukewarm at best. What should have been crispy breading on sesame chicken was pure mush. The flavor wasn't very good either, so I'm not sure it would matter if it were fresh. I called the restaurant and the only point they made was that I would never get crispy food from them via delivery. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Well... I was hungry and this was right across the street with okay reviews. 

And... that is exactly what I got... okay food

I ordered the Lunch Special Garlic Chicken. It came with noodles, fried rice, spring roll, wonton strips with sauce, and corn egg drop soup.

Starting with the soup... let's just say that it was tasteless even after dosing with soy, salt, and pepper (and finally the secret sauce). The wonton strips were a nice surprise and pretty decent, but that sauce... what the heck was that??? The fried rice was typical. The noodles were spaghetti noodles I think? with virtually no vegetables and no flavor. 

Then I tucked into the \"Garlic\" Chicken. I have eaten a LOT of garlic chicken, including some pretty bad renditions. However, I don't think I have ever had garlic chicken with no garlic flavor at all. I'm not saying it tasted bad, but it surely was not garlic chicken.

When you go in there is a counter to order at, so I walked up, ordered, and paid. Imagine my shock when the next two patrons walked in sat down and were waited on like a regular restaurant, hmmmm. The young lady at the register was also the one that delivered my meal and checked on me. The service was friendly and appropriate but it would have been nice to know that to go orders are placed at the counter and eat in patrons should seat themselves and wait for a menu and service. Still shaking my head on this one.

Overall, decent food (not great by any measure) with strange service. I might return if I was hungry in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I had the fish with black bean lunch special.
The good part was the fish was cooked well and they do lunch specials on the weekend. That's about it.
The fish was soooo salty but the chow mein and fried rice that come with it was under seasoned. It also comes with a very small portion of soup. 
It fills you up and the price (around $7) is good for the overall portion, but that isn't enough to make me go back. The one on N Rainbow is much better"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, and pretty quick but the reason why I'm writing this review I( even downloaded the Yelp app)  Service was really bad, we had a young guy with glasses and was in a bad mood will walk away and didn't even refill a drink, I don't usually tip bad but the way he was with us made me not enjoy food and my bf and I took the food to go."}
{"text":"Amazing! So quick and yummy. Mongolian beef tasted authentic. Definitely a better version of Panda Express. Their donuts were great too!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice and clean, and the service was good, but the food was mediocre. I got the Kung pow chicken and was expecting it to be spicy like the menu said it would be. It wasn't spicy at all. It was so salty that not even white rice could help tone down the saltiness. My mom got the combination fried rice and it was pretty good. I don't think any Chinese restaurant has managed to mess that one up for us yet. I don't think I would consider coming back here just because I felt so out of eat from having such a salty dish. Hopefully not all of their dishes are that salty."}
{"text":"Fast Chinese food and you get a lot for your money! 

Food is good. 

But their pot stickers scared me way to big and texture was not on point!"}
{"text":"Great Fried Rice, and Tasty Egg Rolls. The have lunch specials which is a good value, and Tasty Egg Rolls. What I like most about this place is the Kind Friendly Staff!

Very Clean Restaurant!

Get a Large order of fried rice, a meal in itself!"}
{"text":"I'm from Nj and I was scared to try a Chinese restaurant out here but China a Go Go is awesome! Service is great as well"}
{"text":"My food was ready super fast which makes me wonder if it was reheated or perhaps undercooked since it was shrimp. This was the only thing I had eaten that day. Within a few hours, I had flu like symptoms. Long story short. I am on day three with food poisoning. Worst ever. Throwing up, using bathroom, dizzy, head throbbing & body sore. I do not wish this upon anyone. I would stay clear of this place. I have heard one of the locations was on dirty dining. Saw that on another review for a different location."}
{"text":"We love this place. We are even chummy with our delivery driver. Our food ALWAYS arrives hot. Great for a night you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I hate to have to give this review because I know these things can happen... But I feel obligated. I found a bug/fly/beetle in my wonton soup. I uploaded pictures... Make your own decision"}
{"text":"SHELLFISH ALLERGIES The one reason I am giving this place 1 star is because I placed an order today and listed \"no shellfish\" twice. After eating my hot garlic chicken, I began to see hives & my throat began to tighten. I was having an allergic reaction so I rushed to the emergency room and spent hours there ! They had obviously had shellfish near my food or used the same wok after cooking shellfish. Once I got home I called them to tell them about my experience. Their response was \"you're the first person this has happened to. We use one pan for all dishes but we clean it and there's a big fire\" . That's when I knew I was right! I told the manager he needed to add a disclaimer for those with allergies on the site because I figured if i wrote no shellfish in my order twice, that would be accommodated. He jumped around that suggestion and offered me a credit and to put \"is really allergic to shellfish\" under my phone number. Because I obviously want to go back to the hospital.... I turned that down obviously and am furious. I didn't even ask for a refund, just for them to put a disclaimer up so no other person would have to deal with this as Shellfish allergies are very common. This place is getting reported without a doubt!!!"}
{"text":"We typically order food from here once a month to once every two months.   We usually pick up, but had it delivered today.   Big mistake!  Food arrived in decent time and tastes good as usual.  Costumer service was horrible. I thought I had selected to add the tip via yelp because I knew I didn't have much cash on me.  For whatever reason that didn't work out.  The driver asked for a tip.  I explained that I had thought I had included him the tip.  He told me it wasn't included and continued to wait.  I apologized and told him to give me a minute while I located my wallet. Of course, all I had was $1.   I pulled out the dollar and before I could finish apologizing for not having more cash on hand or fully extend my hand to him, he snatched the dollar from my hand.  He turned around and stormed off to his car and left.   I understand that tips are a vital part of income in the food industry, but this was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"My delivery service was very slow! The owner insisted that his driver was on his way but it took another 15 minutes for him to arrive! Overall food was great, but be sure to come here on time, my food got cold!"}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I used to go to lunch here once a week but then our office moved :(
The lunch menu is about $6 and you get 2 meals easy. Cant beat $6 for lunch AND dinner.  

Seems to be family owned and they take good care of you. I made a quick phone call and my food was on the table before I got off the call. If you eat in you get those crispy noodle things and soup too.

I'm sorry that I don't get to go here for lunch anymore but its just a few miles from my house so I still stop in occassionally on weekends to get dinner for take out.

Its one of the better C-A-G-G's I've been to."}
{"text":"This is our go to delivery place.  Always fresh and fast.  They also handle substitutions and special requests extremely well.  We are so glad to have found this location since we moved from the southwest side and loved their location over there."}
{"text":"I thought highly of this place at first, but today I made my mind of never going here ever again, don't ever ask for deliver because you won't have any forks or chopsticks included, but what is the most disgusting of it all is there chow mein, what I got was so soggy noodles that were deep fried yesterday and placed in the fridge and re heated I will never ever go back to this place my egg rolls came with a piece of hair, this place i don't know how it passed the health code, it violated so much"}
{"text":"Good food, always fresh and on time. Try from many choices such as soup, beef and broccoli, seafood, beef, pork without being drenched in sauce."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch and great food and service to match, this is the spot!  We had just walked out of the Macaroni Grill for poor service and chose China a go go instead...SO happy with the food. It made up for being so irritated with the Macaroni Grill! Will DEFINITELY come again! The salt &pepper shrimp was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"After moving from the east coast 15 years ago it took a long time to find a decent place that has good Chinese food. China A GOGOs have been popping up around town for the last 10 years and each of them are really good. They have a friendly staff and they remember their customers. The food is amazing and though I usually swap between the Orange Chicken and House chicken I have had other menu items such as the sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef. They're all hits and I've never had a miss from this gem."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price and the big plus.....it's right around the corner from us....hoot hoot!!!
We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Honey walnut shrimp is a HUGE portion and is actually better than China Tango. Includes rice and wonton chips as an appetizer if you dine in. Not bad for a local spot in Henderson area. Still can't seem to find the best Chinese take out restaurant in Henderson though.

Bathrooms are like storage space too, not the cleanest, but not the worst."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and I definitely say I will be back a lot more! I highly recommend the green apple boba slush and the serving size for the meals are massive! The service here is great very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Ordered online & had dinner delivered. Honey Walnut Shrimp & String Bean Beef with Crab Rangoon, Shrimp Tempura,& pork fried rice. All arrived super fast, hit, & exceptionally delicious!!"}
{"text":"great good, fast delivery, cant go wrong with the teriyaki chicken bowl. the delivery guy is always nice. the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"ordered last night for the first time through door dash delivery service.  well YUM.  i had a cold and the hot and sour soup was just what I needed.  the food we ordered was hot, fresh, and delicious.  definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"Busy place and very good food. For fast food Chinese, delivery, carry-out or dine-in, this is great. Always fast, accurate and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for years.  The food is consistent and good.  They work with us on special orders, and the portion sizes are normal.

They offer delivery, although most times we call in an order and pick it up.   

Watch for their coupons - depending how much your order totals, you may get an additional item free with the coupon."}
{"text":"i've been living in las vegas for two years now and have gotten the doorhangers on my front door advertising other chinese places with coupons but i always come back to china a go go. the other places always disappoint.  at c-a-g-g,  the portions are big, the price is right, delivery is quicker than the quoted time, driver is friendly, and you can order and pay online.  i always get the moo goo gai pan and pot stickers and have enough left over for another meal.  the veggies are not overcooked, the chicken is tasty, and the pot stickers are a meal in themselves.  i'll be back....again...."}
{"text":"Eeewwww!!! Ordered Hunan beef,steamed rice and egg rolls for delivery.It took about an hour to get to us and was dry,luke warm and flavorless.Enough said!Won't be eating at China Go Go in Anthem again."}
{"text":"Good food and great employees. The serving size is enormous and I do recommend going during lunch for the lunch special because you get so much. Prices are worth it and the taste is really good for the price you get. I'll be coming here often."}
{"text":"I would have taken a picture but I was starving and we ordered delivery. So first off this is not authentic Chinese food that you get in china town. This is that yummy American junky style that I love!!! You know the average Chinese take out.  

Me and my coworker ordered lunch specials and our whole area said where did you get that?!?! Then 8 more of our coworkers ordered from them. Not one of us had a complaint. Our bill for two specials and two Thai iced teas was $16. Hello McDonald's pricing lol. I got the cashew chicken special which came with fried rice, chow mien, egg roll and crab Rangoon. So good!!! My friend got the beef pepper steak lunch special she wouldn't share but said it was good!!! Others ordered orange chicken and sweet n sour chicken. All of us were happy!!! 

Delivery took like 20 minutes. So fast and piping hot!!!

We will order again!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in town. I love they have authentic food and Thai tea with boba plus they deliver. Food is freshly made after you place your order. I really like everything about this place... Even ordering online."}
{"text":"my family and i love their hong kong style noodle, orange chicken, and mongolian beef..."}
{"text":"This is our second time at this restaurant and we enjoy it! There food is always hot and fresh! We recommend it to all of our friends and family! The Moo shy pork is to die for and the house special noodles are awesome!"}
{"text":"The delivery was fast, but the food was almost not edible. The orange chicken all you could taste was ginger, and everything else just was super bland! Soy sauce and spicy mustard couldn't save this meal!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! Dry noodles, large chunks of grisly orange chicken, flavorless stir fried rice, and a soup that was horrible! I will never go back here again!"}
{"text":"Best China a Go Go hand down! Not only is their food always good and fresh they have amazing customer service. Whenever we do pick up they always offer us a free drink while we wait and even threw in free homemade donuts! Those little things make us keep coming back and we love it!"}
{"text":"I am a first timer my mother on the other hand has been here a few times since her move. She loves the orange chicken , I myself got the spicy garlic shrimp lunch special and it was just full of flavor and and spice  the pot stickers were yummy and huge!!! Service was great, well attentive. We'll see ya soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Good prices . Perfect for a big family like mine... I ordered for a party of 15 and they had it ready in 20mnts.. thanks allot you guys..."}
{"text":"Great food ever time we come in. Never a problem to have each item just the way we like it which is never they way the menu states the item comes. The staff is super too!"}
{"text":"I live across this restaurant and it drives me crazy, it smells so good! I give them a 4 star because their food is great, especially their beef with hot garlic sauce but the staff is not so welcoming. Other than that, it's great place to get fast chinese food to-go!"}
{"text":"Always great food, fast service and friendly helpful staff. Delivery service is good, just order food 45 mins ahead, they get busy. Can order the food via online too! Which is perfect when you dont have time to be on phone. Their boba is not so good, its a hit or miss. But Thai tea is done right. Overall, this is my new go-to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a few times after I've forgotten how cheap the food tastes. I feel gross and regretful when i have gotten take out.  Not good quality imo"}
{"text":"I ordered the combination Lo Mein, it had a greasy taste to it and there was hardly any meat in it. I don't think I'll be going there again."}
{"text":"A Great place to grab good Chinese food.... Try the Mongolian beef it's spicy but it hits the spot"}
{"text":"YELP has done it again!!! We were on the hunt for a Chinese spot on this side of town other then the franchise boys... Yelpers and their amazing reviews lured us in. They prepared the food fairly quick and handed us a few full bags of delicious awesomeness. The boba tea was great especially the pineapple. Their combination fried rice is like no other fried rice I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Beef Chow Funn & Salt n Pepper shrimp! Can't ever go wrong with those favz. Food is always hot with their quick and prompt delivery!"}
{"text":"I usually settle for this place because it's conveniently located near my house. The customer service was so awful that I avoid this place like the plague now. Beware patrons"}
{"text":"I love this place. The Thai tea and shrimp fried rice is my go to! But it seems like Everytime I order combination chow mein it only comes with one piece of shrimp, which kinda sucks but either way the food is super good!"}
{"text":"All the sudden they claim they don't deliver to my house  when last week they did. I think the food is decent but the customer service and blatant rude behavior towards patrons is ridiculous. I will NEVER GO BACK! Maybe they need to do some customer service training. I don't care what country you originate in. Human kindness is universal. Done done done!"}
{"text":"this is probably the best chinese food i've ever had. the service is very friendly and they are very quick. i usually get the salt & pepper shrimp or the sesame beef. i also swap the white rice with fried rice, it costs a little more but i let none of it go to waste. in the restaurant, there are many places to sit, it doesn't feel crowded, and it's very clean. 10/10"}
{"text":"China A Go Go needs to GO GO the h*ll away!!! Ew does not even cover it! We ordered some type of honey shrimp tempura concoction & the shrimp was raw and the whole dish was plain. We also ordered some pork thing and the pork tasted funny, like it was past the expiration date, I thought for sure we were going to get ill. When I went to grab the salt shaker to put some taste on my food it was all sticky and crusty - DOUBLE EW!!! A big waste of money unless you really like sh*tty chinese food. I have heard that the other China A Go Go's were better - I'll take their word for it and go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"This place is conviently located by my home. The women that work the cashier are always friendly and got their sh*t down! Yesterday I ordered orange chicken, and kung pao shrimp over the phone. She said it'd be ready in 10 mins and it was. Super fast service and still taste yummy! Oh and they have lollipops next to the register but the good flavors are always taken :-("}
{"text":"The first time I came here was for lunch... service was great and sushi was good (spicy Mexican and Las Vegas rolls). Came in a second time for dinner and I was not pleased at all. The woman taking our order looked like she didn't even want to be there and had a bad attitude. Next, the food. I ordered chicken/shrimp Pad Thai, the flavor was just not there. The chicken was yellow and did not look or smell appetizing. My husband ordered \"the spiciest\" item on the menu, spicy chicken, which was not spicy at all and also lacked flavor. 
Then, sushi. We ordered the crispy rice?(don't remember the name) roll and it was the worst roll I've ever had. It had no flavor at all. The man who brought it over didn't bother to give us ginger nor wasabi. 
We will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"This Chinese place is in my 'hood.  I could walk here if I wanted too.  With that being said we tend to frequent this place a lot.  Overall it's a good place that seems to be busy all the time.  I am amazed on how fast they prepare this cuisine.  I always call the order in but I am pretty sure that if I were to show up they would make it pretty quick.  The girls in the front are always nice and greet you when you walk in.  The prices are pretty good.  We used to get the Family dinners but we always ended up with a bunch of leftovers.  Which isn't bad and usually gets eaten the next day.  Lately we have been just getting on entree and upgrading the rice to fired rice.  They give you a big helping of food so it is usually enough without a bunch or any left overs.  I do prefer this place over the big franchise Chinese place that have black and white animals as the mascot.  If you live in the area or just visiting check this place out.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Today I was really lazy and couldn't get out of my house due to my final exams. I wanted to get food but didnt want to drive anywhere. I saw that I could order on Yelp and get delivery from here which was amazing! At first I was concerned and wondering if I should call the restaurant to make sure they got my order. In the end I put my trust in Yelp and I got my food 30 mins after I ordered and paid online! It sucks that you have to pay for delivery but at least it's only $2. I also got a beef entry and when I was paying for it, I was concerned because I thought it was kinda expensive, but when it got here, the amount you get is reasonable. 
Food is great and I would recommend trying out the delivery if you are lazy to drive or to shy to pick up the phone."}
{"text":"Chicken and beef very tender and tasty. Kal bi a little on the chewy side and too strong on the soy sauce but everything delicious! Their salad dressing is out of this world! 

Tempura was great! Not too crazy about shrimp but I love the vegetable pieces."}
{"text":"China a GO GO is my go to place for some quick and cheap chinese food. You can't berat $5.95 for lunch special with corn egg drop soup with your meal!!

I recommend the mongolian beef (w/white rice), general tsao (w/noodles), chicken and string beans (with white rice) and hot garlic chicken (with white rice and noodles).

I think it's better than Panda Express.. It's not expensive.. it's under 10 bucks, and can be shared with 2 people!"}
{"text":"They have gone severely down hill. Have gone here for a couple years for close by chinese. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is good sometimes it taste horrible. I ordered a meal that was supposed to come with orange chicken, rice, chow mein, a side, and a soda. Got everything except the chow mein but a butt load of rice. I had to wait well over 30 minutes for them to deliver the chow mein that should have already come with my food and by then I wasn't even hungry for it. No normal human will eat that much rice and the food was lukewarm when I got it. Vegas sucks for decent chinese. I will never order from this restaurant ever again. Cons out way the pro... which I can't think of any pro's.. no thanks."}
{"text":"I haven't been to any of the China a Go Go locations in a couple years, but we decided to go here last week for dinner. We ordered Family Dinner A - $25.95 which came with 2 Egg Rolls and 2 Crab Rangoons, soup (Egg Flower), rice (BBQ pork fried rice), and two entrees (Orange Chicken & Beef Broccoli). It was more than enough for two people. In fact, it was enough for our dinner that night AND lunch the next day. The food pretty much tasted like most of the other Chinese fast food joints. My favorites were probably the BBQ Pork fried rice and Egg Flower soup; both very satisfying. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. We dined in, so they kept refilling our glasses and making sure we were doing alright. This location definitely has much better service than a couple other China a Go Go locations I've been to."}
{"text":"This place is great l order Chinese eggplant with tofu"}
{"text":"Good place       nice customer service.        nice Chinese food  orange chicken is very good.    I'll be back"}
{"text":"Food was ok but I found a hair at the bottom of the broccoli & chicken food container! Of course after when the food was almost all gone. Combination fried rice lacked flavor but veggie chow mein & egg rolls were good. I probably won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"Much better food than your average takeout Chinese. The mongolian beef actually has some spice to it. My kids love the chicken chow mein and the fried rice. 

We have always had great service and extremely fast takeout. We can literally call on our way home and it's done when we get there. The prices are average, the family deals are usually the best options. (Look for coupons in your weekly mail circulars.) The actualy establishment is more geared for take away service vs. eating as a family @ the location. Ok spot for eating alone, or as a pair."}
{"text":"Came in with the wife and service and food was amazing! We had the beef and brocolli as well as the general tso chicken. Really happy we came."}
{"text":"A basic but solid Chinese food joint. Clean, quick and super friendly staff. I called in a to go order and was surprised when I was told I could pick it up in 5 minutes. Whoa there, girl! 5 minutes? I can't even get out to my car and down the street in 5 minutes! I asked her if they could have it ready in 30 minutes instead. She obliged. 
I showed up 30 minutes later and the food was packed up and ready to go. I decided on the personal dinner and chose sesame chicken as my entree and chow mein for the side. The dinner also comes with soup, a crab rangoon and an egg roll. It's a ton of food for just $10. 
I didn't even get into the soup (think I'll save that for lunch tomorrow). The food was decent-not spectacular but good enough. The crab rangoon was the best part-of course how can you go wrong with crab and cream cheese? The egg roll wasn't my favorite-that's all I'll say about that. The chow mein was simple-noodles, bean sprouts, onions and carrots. The flavor was good. The sesame chicken wasn't too bad. I have a sneaking suspicion that although I asked for the food to be ready in a half hour, they may have stuck to the 5 minute time frame cause the entire meal just tasted kind of-older. 
The menu is extensive and has all the usual Chinese choices along with a couple Thai options. The restaurant is in kind of a dying shopping center but it's easy to find and there are quite a few tables if you want to eat there. 
I'll be back to dine inside-the food will be fresher that way, I'm sure. With the lack of decent Chinese food restaurants on this side of town, China a Go Go is a welcome addition. Good food, great prices and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Found this gem when I had first moved to Vegas and was without a stove, turns out, it's my favorite local Chinese restaurant!

I always order the chicken and broccoli and egg drop soup. 

The staff is so nice and friendly, I was impressed. The restaurant itself is a bit small but I usually don't go during regular lunch or dinner rushes, so I can always find a seat.

I have not ordered delivery from China A Go Go but, looking at reviews, they seem to be great at delivering!"}
{"text":"This place is really close to my house... so when we don't want to cook... we get take-out.

It's better than Panda Express... not as good as PF Chang's.
More expensive than Panda Express... not as expensive as PF Chang's.

I'm rounding up this time... as I would normally give a place like this 3.5 stars... but they are always quick and the location is really good for me.

I really, really, really like their Wor Won Ton soup... I make it a meal most times.  It's got meaty big wontons, succulent shrimp, pork strips, chicken strips, snow peas, cabbage and carrots in a clear savory broth.  I add a bit of garlic chili sauce and it's perfect!

It's hit or miss here on their other dishes... sometimes they are really good and sometimes they are just 'eh'.  I'm not a fan of their noodle dishes.  They seem to heavy and starchy. (Note: their rice isn't anything all that great either.... it tends to be dry.)

I like their kung pao (anything) and their chicken and green beans is a favorite. 

The good thing is that they don't have the food sitting out in chafing dishes like other Chinese places... .they seem to cook your order when you place it rather than have it already cooked and just ladling it out."}
{"text":"Great crispy, crunchy noodles with duck sauce (the stuff they give you when you order soup) - I couldn't stop eating them!  Next time I'm gonna ask for some more!

The food was delivered through GrubHub and arrived on time.  It was still piping hot and delicious.  It's on point with the flavors of what American Chinese fast food is about so I was a very happy camper!  The portion size was excellent for the $7 and under meals.  Great value!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! Came all the way from Hawaii and this was on the top of my list to come and eat. I've never had better Chinese food anywhere else always perfection when I come here. I ordered the family dinner meal chicken chop suey, Mongolian chicken, veggie fried rice, and shrimp chow mein. It was just as I remembered when I visited a year ago this place is consistent with their quality in food, customer service and cleanliness. Their pricey but you get what you paid for, food has flavor and they give you a lot of food. Oh yea thank you Yuki!"}
{"text":"I gotta give it to this location, the food is way better than any other place I had order. Got the won ton soup, pepper & garlic shrimp, HK style crispy noodle and sesame chicken (the best of orange chicken w/sesame) it was all really good and no complaints from me. Found an awesome chinese delivery that might just beat some of the chinese place I have tried in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I'm glad they opened on right down the street from my house. The prices are reasonable and fast. They deliver as well love it."}
{"text":"Good food sadly portions have reduced as time as gone by, love their Mongolian beef, ok orange chicken, sadly not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Eating off styrofoam with plastic utensils when paying full price just doesn't seem right."}
{"text":"I had a lunch special. Something any 50 plus pound overweight person would enjoy. Large quantity of tasteless food served in a Styrofoam box, even though I ate in. On the plus side everything was served fast and hot. Soup no flavor,  chicken was spicy,  but didn't taste like anything. I'm sure the egg roll was frozen fast food, it also was flavorless. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I always feel like it taste great. I haven't food another Chinese food place that I like more then this one. The only thing I would say I dont like about this place is that the food isn't always consistent taste wise. It always taste good but other days are better then some. That's easy to over look for me specially when it's always fresh, taste good, and customer service is great."}
{"text":"It's good, it's fast and decent portions. It's close to my house so I don't have far.  I've never had an issue with the staff, they are efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"It bothers me that I even have to give it one star. I don't know what happened over the last year. This used to be a great place with great food, now it appears like things have changed for the worst. Food lacks taste, flavor or consistency. Almost like refrozen dehydrated pop in the fryer cheap ingredients.
More so now I think they just don't care. 
Last night was the last of China a go go for me or my family. We all got sick with Diarrhea and vomiting."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! This by far has been my favorite Chinese American food I have favored! I have rated the food from an A to F ratings. My A list has been the Phad Thai Noodles and Kung Pao. The Phad Thai Noodles will fill you up quick! You probably won't be able to finish the whole thing in one seating. They are pretty hot, but the good hot. The egg and shrimp are popping. You can't really get overwhelmed with the mint leaves so that's good. The Kung Pao is just as spicy and the meat is real good.

  I have only one B dish which is the Sungapore Curry Noodles. The noodles just have a great pleasant taste to eat. You just enjoy the taste. My C list is the Phad Kee Meo and New York Style Chow Mein. The Phad has a similar taste to the Phad Thai but without all the spiciness just the flavor. Also the Phad has an up notch taste to those regular fake Chinese places. Every time I go in and make my order it is super fast! And if they take a little longer with your order it's either A they are busy, or they are making it from scratch and are busy so your order is going to be a little hot, but tastier. 

  At least that's how I've seen it. The Wontons are good also crispy. I've had there lunch specials. The rice doesn't feel that much like your chocking on it and the noodles are okay. The boba from here is good also. I think what makes this place soo good is that it has kept a lot of the same cooks from it's grand opening and has kept at least two of the original staff members. It's been four years since it's opened and it has been kicking ass for me since then. One day I wish to try out the restaurant next door to it.

  If you are around the area you should give this place a try. I will keep updating this reviews when I try new dishes from this place."}
{"text":"Quantity and Quality. We always get great food and a great price!

When they warn you that the Mongolian beef is hot, they mean it."}
{"text":"GReat food.  This was my second visit.  Both times equally good.  There were 8 of us, each of us with a different dish and then we shared three different types of sushi as appetizers.  All of it was good quality and taste.  The service was good too."}
{"text":"My wife is one of the pickiest eaters I've met, but for some reason she loves the vegetable chow mein here and the spring rolls. Now, I've had both, the chow mein is forgettable to say the lease and I'm pretty sure the egg rolls are just frozen from 7-11 or something. But, she loves it and I'll get her whatever she wants. 

On the nights she's craving her chow mein and spring rolls, I just get an order of their egg flower soup and a side of rice, i mix them together and add a little low sodium soy sauce and a healthy dose of sriracha. It's very good and filling and cheap.

There isn't much more I can say about the place, it's cheap, quick chinese food. It's a little more expensive then panda express and a little better, but don't expect gourmet. I'd say it falls somewhere between panda and p.f. changs, but a lot closer to panda express. 

Coke products gained them an extra star on my review. Sorry look at this as a 3 star review."}
{"text":"One of the best locations for food quality of fast food to go.   Their service is really good and one of the fastest.  Only down side is when you call their English is not so good."}
{"text":"Great food with lots left over. Honey walnut shrimp on of the best in town. Great customer service. If you don't like spicy they will make it mild for you if you ask. I love this place."}
{"text":"They never fail to surprise. The food is great. The delivery is awesome. If you love Chinese food this is the place to order and they are fast and friendly."}
{"text":"5 stars, but... Didn't like their hot and sour soup. It was weird, had unusual ingredients and it's pretty much a staple that's the same everywhere, so I was surprised. 

Was our second time ordering delivery, consistently fast, hot, friendly, and the portions are good. We always order way too much food.

The curry Singapore noodles are wonderful, and they give you your choice of heat on most items. 

Will keep going back!

11/8/15 batting 1000. Ordered delivery. Very good, fast (about 45 minutes), and hot. :). During Sunday night football!

Their ribs and, salt and pepper wings are both great! Yummy."}
{"text":"They are the best in vegas so far.. and I'm used to San Francisco Chinese food.  Delivery is usually quick and drivers don't get lost"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food and  FAST"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  The food is Delicious.  We ordered Potstickers and Ragoons for appetizers. For lunch:  Walnut Shrimp and Chicken Lettuce Wrap, complimentary fried wonton wraps dipped in sweet n sour sauce and donuts. We also had Mango Boba slushy--Loved it.  We plan to go back again when we are on that side of town. Service was good too.  :)"}
{"text":"I just love the food! Fresh and nicely sesoned, cooked as good Asian food should be. 
The service has been exceptional  every time. 
I recommend giving this restaurant a try. If you are a fan of Asian food you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A bit of a mix emotion about this place, but overall, its very decent.  

Located on the corner of Decatur and Ann is China A Go Go.  Going to the actual place, it seems to be in a nice area.  Going inside, is a different story.  I'm sure they keep their place clean as possible.  But the fact that it's really small, it tend to get crowded very easily.  Of course I ordered to go, since there wasn't really much of a choice of seating arrangements, plus it seems crowded as is.  

The staff on the other hand, they're very good, I really respect the fact that they, keep their cool under pressure.  They seem nice and courteous, despite how busy and crowded it was.  

The food was really good, for a decent Chinese food on the go.  The pricing is reasonable as well.  

Overall, if you do like Chinese food, this is a decent place to order to go, if you're in the area.  Most of the time, I would suggest to order to go.  If you don't mind the small area and crowds, it might be interesting to dine in.  But dining in isn't highly suggested."}
{"text":"First time here.
I enjoyed it. We got the family dinner B with soup, combination rice and some beef and shrimp entrees. It was delicious and the portions were huge. 
I didnt like the packaging! Some of the boxes were leaking and greasy.
For a place with a lot of carry out and delivery they have to improve this."}
{"text":"Best service every time i come here! Good food and friendly staff. The food is very fresh!

Dont find good places around here anymore"}
{"text":"Ordered orange chicken and General Tso's chicken which were both made with those breaded frozen chicken nuggets made with compressed white & dark chicken parts ground together with occasional cartilage and grissel. The breading was soggy and mushy and everything smelled/tasted \"old\".  Hardly any vegetables other than onion and green peppers and the bottom of the container was filled with undercooked broccoli that could not even be chewed through. I think there was one lone carrot strip in there. Even the fortune cookies were soggy and didn't taste right.  I was surprised the food was so bad, especially on a Sunday when most Chinese restaurants are popping and the food should be fresh. $20 down the drain. I definitely won't order here again.  I gave 2 stars because the service was fast and pleasant.  Panda Express would be considered \"gourmet\" compared to what I got."}
{"text":"It's great in a pinch! The service is friendly, and while not the most attentive, they do genuinely want to help and care about your experience. Everything is made fresh, which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Good enough for me! I like this place, because they are always fast and always get my order correct, and the prices are solid for the amt of food you get. I got a beef fried rice and mongolian beef, so I could have leftovers. I mean, who doesn't like chinese leftovers? Mongolian is a little spicy for a lot of people, but its perfect for me. With the fried rice I add sweet chili sauce and some cock sauce to give it some heat and sweet!! No reason to complain, they've always been solid for me and I've been here probably 50+ times in about 4 years, (like I've said before, location being close to me is great).
Btw, delivery service has always been fast too. Just order enough so the surcharge is actually worth it!"}
{"text":"We have been buying take out from them for years but last night looked like the trash can from an operating room and tasted like nothing and had really nothing but the awfullest looking big think hunks of cream colored and slimy chicken, mushrooms one little piece of corn, about a 1/8 of an inch of a piece of carrot...well U get the point and the Thai noodle dish was same chicken and tastless noodles.  This is not how their food used to be...not even close...even the soy sauce was different and tasteless....guessing, new owners?"}
{"text":"I wrote a review for China a \"GoGo\"(no space) which is a different listing for this same restaurant. I'm just going to cut and paste my old review and place here on what seems to be the proper China A \"Go Go\". Been there a lot of times since my initial review and the praise still holds today.  

*** Original review ***

Excellent Chinese food, although there was too much broccoli in my beef and broccoli for my taste. I've never sat in or called in an order there. I've always just walked in and ordered and have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for my orders of at least 3 entries to be ready. Highly recommend.

Oh and by the way. There's actual Chinese people working and cooking there. Every time I go into a restaurant based on some ethnic food, that isn't a a big chain like Panda Express or Olive Garden, I always try to see if the cooks are of or at least within' the ethnic parameters of given store. This passed the test! There were like 3 Chinese people cooking, two Chinese people working the tables, a Chinese dude handling the front end and I even think there was a Chinese dude waiting for the next delivery order to be ready for delivery. That alone gives this place a 5/5."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location and it was overall pretty good. The service was good and the food was pretty tasty. I noticed everything looked very clean and well organized."}
{"text":"I travel a long way just to come to China A Go Go, it is my favorite place to eat Chinese food in Vegas; the price is super good, the food is fast and the service is incredible. Thank you so much for everything."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great, fast & inexpensive. Staff is always really friendly and I love how close this location is to my house. My favorite thing here is the hot garlic shrimp. Spicy yet full of flavor."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Chinese place in Las Vegas. Their lunch special is the best as it is very affordable and the portions are perfect. My favorite thing to get is their House special chicken with mushrooms and their Thai tea yum."}
{"text":"Not great, not terrible. Average Chinese food, good for delivery on a day you don't feel like cooking or getting out. A few dishes stand out over the others. Chicken or Shrimp with Broccoli and Egg Foo Young are consistently pretty tasty. Again, nothing special or spectacular but convenient if you live in the Southern Highlands area."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese place close to home  The food is always good and for the 2 of us we usually get the family meal A and it will last is for days."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to love this place. We will now never eat here again. Last night at around 8:30pm we ordered food for delivery. We had a couple of bites and then saved the food for our lunch the next day (today). 

This morning as we grab the food out the fridge and pour it into a plate, we noticed MOLD on the noodles... most disgusting thing I've ever seen. We got sick to our stomach because we probably ate moldy noodles last night. 

Never again.. beware of what you're eating. Pour everything on a plate instead of eating it out of the container they bring it in."}
{"text":"My go to Chinese take out. I know their other locations has gone on dirty dining but you have to judge each restaurant for their own efforts. They are not a franchise so I don't assume they have an SOP. But in this location their food is always really good and authentic. They are super nice and again their food is always fresh and delicious.
Another good thing about them is that they are English and Chinese fluent so if there is something that I want they can always customize. I would give 5 stars but their location cannot hold more than 20 people and their deliver is a bit slow. But I don't blame them they are always busy:)"}
{"text":"Always delivers superfast super friendly individual great food and a great price support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"I work near this place. It is so perfect when you are craving Chinese food and don't want to spend a lot of money. The staff is always friendly and the food comes to you hot and fast. I never had any problems with the flavor or quality of the food. it's always so fresh! My favorite  items are the bbq pork ribs. Oh man they are so good!  I am hungry just writing this up.  You can sit at the few tables they have available, or take the food to go."}
{"text":"I went in to pick up a lunch special here and as I proceeded to grab my drink before I left. A dingy man came up to the woman at the counter with a ziplock bag of raw dripping chicken he asked the woman if she could fry the meat. I was absolutely appalled when I saw her take the meat from the man and give it to one of the cooks. The man walked away and came back and told the woman he had fish. She gave the man a busier tray from the kitchen and we walked out. As I got into my car I notice the man standing outside the trunk of his car with (BARE HANDS) was grabbing raw fish with their heads skin and scales still attached and putting them into the tray the woman at the counter gave him. If I didn't know any better I would defiantly say what's going on is totally illegal and unsafe in a environment that handles food. When I got back to my office my food taste so gross I couldn't even finish it. Now I'm afraid I'll be sick! Never again will I eat here. I regret not taking a picture of the man, this place needs to be closed down for good!"}
{"text":"So far the best Chinese food I have found in the Las Vegas valley (just got here 5 months ago) .  I ate also at a location by Warm Springs which was also good and also the one on Durango which I found to also be good."}
{"text":"Fortunately food tasted better than it looked.  Definitely don't dine in.  Between the cluttered room and very loud men in the kitchen I had to take my lunch to go"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location a few times. But this last time on 3/24/2017 the service was disgusting the order was wrong and incomplete. I ordered orange chicken and what I got was dried out almost flavorless chicken I asked for no steamed rice and got 2 big containers of it I called to find out why things were wrong and incorrect instead I heard it was the new girl she doesn't understand then I get you'll get next time. This is the final time I think if I pay for something we should get what we paid for also it took the driver over an hour to deliver the incorrect wrong order further while talking to the lady on the phone she gave me someone else's address saying it was mine then had the nerve to ask me if I'm sure I believe I know my own address I had to tell her your wrong I don't care what shows up from my number im not the first person to have a cell number. So all of this is to say I am now done with this place completely."}
{"text":"So we get the adds for this place, and on the add it says delivery up to 5 miles ! We are 4.8 and they will not deliver to us..... Nice !!!! You should take that off your add thanks for wasting my time!"}
{"text":"This place is the ONLY place close to my house that serves Chinese, so I am sort of a captive audience.  I can say this, I will eat it when I need Chinese food, but If there was other options nearby, I probably would drive a little further to get that.  It is not terrible by any means, but I have learned what they do well, and what they don't.  For example, I will not get pot stickers/dumplings from them.   they are just too thick and doughy.  Second...I don't order their soups, they are tasteless.   You get the point."}
{"text":"This place is fast and good! Drinks, appetizers and everything else always comes out on time. Family friendly! I love the chicken lettuce wraps and shrimp and snow peas! They have combo family orders that are very convenient and also have party trays for small get togethers!"}
{"text":"I have never dined in always had delivery service to my home. Food is always freshly made and hot. Very friendly and courteous customer service. Only place I've had Chinese food delivered and I will continue to do so."}
{"text":"This is one of my least favorite Chinese restaurant. Food does not seem fresh. Taste is bland. I would recommend Cook on Wok."}
{"text":"We stopped by for some food before an appointment we had that was in the same area. It was our first time there. I expected it to be good but not that good! It was so delicious!! And they give you plenty of food and it didn't take long to come out at all!! It was fast, yummy, and more than enough. It's far from home but we will definitely be back! The service was great too! They were so kind and attentive. You can tell they are good people. If you're in the mood for Chinese, go here. They won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Just found this place near the house and ordered to go. Food was tasty and the service is efficient.  Will visit again, to try different items."}
{"text":"My husband had the pork fried rice a few weeks ago and wanted to get some for me to try today. Yes! It is excellent. Has a great flavor and the pork was abundant and good quality  (not one piece of fat or grizzle). The employees are always very nice and very fast with getting your order done. Good place ! Try the roasted pork with Chinese vegetables. It's really good too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if China Go Go is a franchise but this is the worst of the bunch.  I've had a lot of meals at their location in Aliante which rivals restaurants in Chinatown.  This location on Trop is very dirty.  Dried rice caked on the floor and dust on chairs.   It looks like nothing has been cleaned in years.  

The food is equally bad.  I ordered the black bean fish filet that I've had dozens of times at other locations.  This one was inedible.  I'll never return to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered and paid on my phone and it was ready for me to grab when I got there! Really quick"}
{"text":"This food is always delicious- I've ordered take out many many times- this was the first time I ordered through Yelp- fast service - food is great- highly suggest the walnut shrimp and the chicken fried rice and crab rangoons. Add some chow mein and the king pao.. don't forget Jasmine Tea- 

Also, they are connected to a sushi restaurant and so they take sushi orders to go also!! Win win! The owner is such a nice man and always is so nice to my dad, Ernie. We have been ordering since 2010 and have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Customer service was A+ and the food??!! Incredible!!! You know when you have a craving for Chinese food but don't wanna spend $1 and have it be saltier than the Dead Sea? This place satisfied my craving AND was seasoned correctly. We got the Lettuce Wraps, Combination Chow Mein and Chicken Teriyaki with fried rice. Bill with 3 soft drinks came out to round $35ish. We DEFINITELY had left overs. Booths were comfy and the vibe was cozy. Will be returning. Enjoyed that a complimentary appetizer was brought out even before ordering. Try the fried donuts!!!"}
{"text":"I swung by China A Go-Go today for the lunch special because I was in the mood for some cheap, Chinese food!

I ordered the lunch special ($5.95) with Spicy Garlic Chicken with came with Chow Mein and Fried Rice. Apparently, if you eat in, you get a cup of the soup of the day, which is cool, but I took it out.

The food was alright, nothing to write home about, but not bad either! The Spicy Garlic Chicken wasn't really spicy at all and struck me as being more sweet than anything else. 

It was a minor thing, but I asked for no vegetables and there were TONS of veggies in the Chow Mein...perhaps it's pre-cooked that way and heated up. In any case, I ate around the veggies :)

Really not a bad place for a cheap bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience all three times.     stay away
I've tried this place e times because it is close and each time I've kicked myself for going back.   Rude rude people and service.   Wonton soup tasted like fishy dishwasher 2 times I tried it.  Very pricey for tiny portions.    The staff waited on one couple hand and foot bringing them samples and little treats.     Guess I'm the wrong ethnicity.    RUDE and lousy"}
{"text":"I ordered beef and broccoli and fried rice last night and since about 6am I have not been able to get off the toilet.  Aside from some eggs and toast I ate yesterday morning, this was all I had to eat so it wasn't too hard to narrow down what did it.  I called the restaurant to talk with the manager \"Johnny\" but he only said that he suggested I go to a doctor. He refused to credit the order and said he'll keep my name and number for the next time. I will not order from them again."}
{"text":"Good prices, nice clean fast food style restaurant. Service was attentive enough, and the food TASTED ok. Not great, but ok. The problem is, it made me sick to my stomach later. In ways I don't care to discuss. I felt off the rest of the day, and will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"This place has delish food. The service is fast and food is made to order. The prices are fair. They also deliver. Their delivery is fast too. My food was delivered 30 min after I had placed the order."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Not only is the food the best Chinese food ive had, they always cook it fresh to order and the portions are so much that two people can eat off one plate. Also there customer service is exalent. My new favorite Chinese food spot"}
{"text":"I love the combination fried rice always nice and rich flavor ! Very close to my house as well so easy to pick up food always done when I get there !"}
{"text":"This place is now my favorite! The staff if super nice and the food is amazing. The place is clean and you feel welcome when you walk in because they greet you. 10/10 will come always when I want Chinese"}
{"text":"Uh my food was an hour and 20 minutes late that resulted in cold food. Also they forgot to bring my soup I truly needed with this hang over I have over here and also no soy sauce. My ice was melted and my soda taste horrible. Also paid more for extra meat and well it looked like it would normally be, no extra meat. But, all in all it wasn't that bad but I'm Sticking to my other place..."}
{"text":"The food here is really tasty. I have ordered from this location probably a dozen times now. Sometimes my order is not correct when it arrives (different items, lack of rice, something like that), but as far as preparation, speed, and taste, I am a fan. If you are thinking of eating in the dine-in section, prepare yourself for a busy, crowded, informal little space. It's more like eating at fast food than an actual restaurant. The delivery is incredibly fast and friendly, and other than the occasional incorrect order, I have always enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Used to order from this place a lot, until a few days ago. I ordered delivery orange chicken w/ no sauce. I got overcooked, hard, un-edible chicken. When my boyfriend called to let them know, we were immediately disrespected! They told us that's how the chicken is cooked and that its good. We continued on the phone for 10 minutes before coming to a resolution. They wanted us to come into the restaurant and give the food back and would switch it out with a beef & broccoli. The big issue was my boyfriend just had surgery on his torn Achilles and is not supposed to drive. We had already tipped & paid for a delivery fee. They knew they made a mistake and still wouldn't budge. When we went in we showed them the food that they had served us and still would not admit they were clearly in the wrong. We had him taste a piece of the overcooked chicken they had given to us and even he didn't want to eat it. Although they did resolve the issue by providing us with another entree, the customer service ruined it for us. When  you know your food is not prepared satisfactory, you should be able to admit it and accept it."}
{"text":"So I have ordered from China A Go Go for about 5 years now and have never had an issue. Today I called and as usual when calling from work I had 2 orders as we are paying seperatly, the girl on the phone told me that it would be 2 delivery fees, when I asked why she put someone else on the phone and they told me they now charge for each seperate order. When I told them to cancel the order she seemed like she did not care about loosing a customer  who was canceling a $25 order before taxes all because they wanted to charge an extra $2 . I will do a review on China Tango once im done eating lol, and China Tango only charges $2 for a delivery fee and the rate did not go up for seperate orders."}
{"text":"Delicious food and boba tea. Love their sweet and sour sauce. And reasonably priced family meals."}
{"text":"Before today I would've given them five stars. They are always fast. They always deliver on time. The delivery guys are always very friendly. They usually throw in some free stuff to your order. And out of the 10 times I have had delivery from them, nine times the food was exceptional. today it was pretty average, which is why I'm only giving them four stars. But I'm sure all restaurants just have a bad day every now and then?"}
{"text":"Dinner was great  nice employees too love love the wor won ton ...me and family will be back soon"}
{"text":"Would have been 4or 5 stars but the cooks were eating which is no big deal but when 3 of the 4 of them went back in the kitchen to cook they rinsed their hands..no soap and hand washing lasted for maybe 15-20 seconds. On man actually used soap and almost washed his hands for 30 seconds! However the food was very good and fast and the service is nice. It would be nice to adhere to hand washing regulations"}
{"text":"Good food, always fresh and excellent customer service!!!

The won ton soup is amazing with plenty of won tons!

Lettuce wraps are really good with plenty of meat. Better then PF Changs."}
{"text":"We ordered pick up last night for dinner and the food was awful. I was pretty disappointed. I got my husband the Mongolian beef and it was incredibly dry. I ordered the lemon chicken for myself and again, super dry. They also serve it on lettuce and there was nearly a full head of lettuce in my to go container. They also didn't put the sauce on it which I don't understand-maybe they didn't want it to get soggy but trust me, it was so dry that wouldn't have been an issue at all. The service was also terrible-I don't think the guy who helped me even said a single word to me during the entire transaction. We've had a lot of good experiences here but after last night, my husband asked me not to go back. I'm bummed because we did really love this place."}
{"text":"They were great but messed up my wife's order she said no Chile and they put Chile they were nice but didn't understand English when my wife was ordering ."}
{"text":"The food here was actually really good. We got the family combo. The only thing I didn't care for is if your eating in they serve you on paper plates and not on actual plates but other than that the service was really good and they kept on checking on us to make sure we were ok. Worth coming back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I order from here quite often.  I usually get the meal for one and it's more than one person can eat in one sitting.  Their hot and sour soup is the best in town andI love their fried rice.  I have never tried their delivery service but they are supper fast getting my order together when I take my food to go.  The food is good, the service is fast, and the price is right, that is not to love."}
{"text":"Delivery Rating Only - When I ordered my food it was a easy process and wasn't difficult to navigate the menu online I went ahead and ordered the Orange Chicken with Fried Rice not knowing the size of the orders at the time being that I never have ate here before.

After ordering it took approximately less then 15 minutes to get a text message saying that my order was enroute to my residence. The delivery representative was very polite and very professional when arriving at my door.

The portions you order are a decent size and they make very good meals by themselves they are packaged in separate containers which was different then Panda Express how they out everything on one plate. This makes it great for mixing and matching food when ordering for a group of people.

The price wasn't bad at all in fact I thought it was rather cheap compared to other establishments I have visited in the past but the quality is there. I didn't have any problems with the food it was hot and fresh when it arrived ready to eat!

I would recommend to a friend and others looking for a decent / quick meal of great value."}
{"text":"Definitely will be back. Our waitress took our order with out writing it down, didn't miss anything. Plates are a nice size probably big enough to share. Chow mein is ok. And the price is not bad. Nice dining are"}
{"text":"This business is near my house and I have eater and take  out many times.  First it is the health Rule you must wear gloves when handling food , you can not take it out to cook with your hands.  This place has A  rating and I was their when the Health /dept was their.  So I go back and order to take out and no Gloves I tell them they need to tell your cooks to put on gloves when handling food, so on with the gloves, next time no gloves tell them they need to put gloves on.  So I order my food and take it home found a pice of metal in the food and take it back the next day show them, or we are sorry I could have choked on this they need to check their items to make sure they are not missing metal for them.  I inform them that they have a A reading and I could be a B if they don't start to were gloves .  No manager their , I must say their food is very good but I don't eat their ofter because I have a problem with shrimp and the walks are not cleaned, they are raised out and used again, no soap."}
{"text":"When i ordered on eat24 they lied and stated they did not have drivers at this time to deliver. When I called and asked for delivery they said they could deliver.  They tried to use the excuse that they dont deliver outside 4 mile.......My building is 2.1 miles from the restraunt..... they probably didnt want to deliver because the size of my order.....the food is not bad but i will not order from somewhere that lies to me....."}
{"text":"This place always has really great food i havent met anything i didnt like! The egg foo yound is good! The moo goo is so bomb it make my heart just melt"}
{"text":"Have the best kung pao chicken and they have a lunch special which makes it more affordable!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and have not been disappointed! Their lunch/dinner plates are reasonably priced, taste delicious, and are quite full! Even their delivery is quick and friendly. It's one of the very few places that offer fish in black bean sauce in their lunch specials. For that, they have my heart!"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese restaurant! Fresh food, good and Fast service! It's our families favorite Chinese restaurant. The fried rice is the best you'll ever try! And their fried donuts are amazing! I recommend going during lunch hour so it won't be so packed"}
{"text":"The lunch specials were reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. The downfall was the service and cleanliness. Out of the 6 spoons on the table 4 were dirty. The sushi was disgusting worse than Albertson's sushi. If you are looking for well priced and good portions of decent Chinese food the lunch specials will do. The service wasn't that great. It's like they try to test their memory skills by taking orders without writing them down then come back and ask you to repeat the order again... They should have just wrote it down the first time. Simple requests like boxes and I've already ordered my drinks aren't understood. Don't ask them questions or they will just stare at you blankly."}
{"text":"It's not that good, the Lemon Chicken was tough and over cooked. Lemon sauce while it was on the side in the to go order didn't taste like lemon sauce. The shrimp fried rice was pretty plain and the shrimp was low quality and not very much. Good service and reasonable price, but not that good. Might try some noodles and maybe some veggie/tofu items if I ever go back. I wish it was better."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING. Ordered beef and broccoli, 20 mins after eating starting to feel it. I was a human fountain from both ends for about 24 hrs. It's sad because we used to love coming here. STAY AWAY, FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR UNBORN CHILDREN AND PETS, STAY VERY FAR AWAY."}
{"text":"All the food was really good; shrimp pad Thai, teriyaki beef bowl, beef chow mein, chicken fried rice and steamed rice. The service was great and they had my order packed up, in under 15 minutes, before I got there. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm a fan of this place. The food is salty, the thai tea is too sweet, the rice tastes fake...once a year I'll order food to see if anything has changed..it's been the same the last 4 years.."}
{"text":"I love getting there wonton soup whenever I'm feeling sluggish or sick. There's a variety of fresh vegetables in the wontons are very big and will cut. I like their Mongolian beef entr√©e. It just has the right amount of spicy and sweet along with a thin fry layer on the beef.

There are some entr√©es that I feel like have been over battered and fried but it's just my preference. The staff is nice and quick make it to your food as fast as possible. I live the closest location so it's very convenient. The pictures are of my to go order."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on with Vegas and why the Chinese Chicken salad I ordered had jalape√±os in it. Way too spicy and I did not eat it all but threw it out. When I want a Chinese chicken salad, my palette wants mandarin oranges and a sweet sauce-not spicy! Four stars because so far this is our favorite Chinese food in Vegas. Favorite dish is the chicken with string beans. Tons of fresh string beans. LOVE. This dish alone will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going here for years ever since it opened. The staff here are....pleasant. They rarely smile but at the same time they're never rude. The quality of the food is good and everything we've had so far tasted great. The place is well kept and your order doesn't take long to get ready."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food in Vegas! Great customer service and super fast when it comes to getting the food to the table!"}
{"text":"The food is always good and comes out really fast!!! I've been going there for many year now, it's very convenient that they have sushi as well, all you can eat for 20 bucks for lunch! And lunch special for 7 bucks really reasonable prices!!"}
{"text":"I am from California & it's very difficult to find a Chinese restaurant that accommodates to your needs as a customer. I specifically love the general tso chicken made less spicy, less vegetables, extra pineapple, and use white meat. As well as the mapo tofu with no pea or carrot. The taste is wonderful! It meets every standard that i have for Chinese food and they're quick at it! They might make a mistake here and there with the order but I don't mind! A lot of other places refuse to change their ingredients but this china a go go suites your needs accordingly. The service isn't outstanding but what to expect from a popular place!? I recommend coming before 6:30 PM because the rush is bonkers crazy! And for parties over 8? Get ready to move tables!! All in all I love china a go go on ann and Decatur! As a side note I'm pretty frustrated not with their service nor their food because after further investigation other claims about them being on \"dirty dining\" was true but change in management has made the store soo much better these past FEW YEARS. Yes. I said years. What baffles me the most with other reviews is that they judge based on old information or they complain about missing food when after further discussing with the owner on my last visit, majority of the people have complicated orders that's difficult to keep up with! I think some sympathy is in order for the store. So if you're needing a quick bite to eat that's healthy and fast? Try out china a go go!! Best Chinese in north LV yet in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Great service and the food is always delicious and fresh. Come here at least 3 times a month. I have brought several friends and they love it too."}
{"text":"I usually order delivery from a different spot but I thought I'd change things up tonight and unfortunately I will not order from here again. The food was ok. But the delivery driver could not understand me and I could not understand him. I understand a language barrier but when you have to explain directions to someone over the phone it's very frustrating. I asked for soy and hot mustard to be included with my order and it was not. The food was cold when the driver finally did arrive because he got lost. I don't blame him. The restaraunt should have better gps instructions."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Chinese take out and don't want that corporate Panda express crap, you're in the right place. This joint cooks their food to order, albeit quickly, instead of leaving their food out under nausea inducing heat lamps. I definitely like that it is family owned and fairly priced.


 You can taste the freshness in the food that you won't find at one of those stereotypical chinese fast food eateries. The portion sizes were generous too and a family meal is more than enough food for a family of 5, or perhaps even 6. That being said, the taste was only decent. The fried rice was flavorful and rich. The egg drop soup was as expected. The orange chicken is tasty and familiar, but brings nothing new to the table. The kung pao chicken had lots of crunchy vegetables but I have had better. The crab rangoons weren't good at all, but don't take my word for it because I've never liked those things. The spring rolls were ok but I've had better at random hole in the wall thai restaurants. The bottom line is that this place, while worthy of my future business, still cannot beat Pick up Stix in terms of quality and flavor. I hate to say it, but a corporation still has these guys beat."}
{"text":"Tasteless. Over cooked. Also, Worst orange chicken I've EVER had. Bloody embarrassing, just horrid. Staff should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Good food, great portions and price and the staff is always very pleasant I come here most every Saturday."}
{"text":"I don't know what these people are smoking, but China a Go Go is your typical fast food chinese for a price decent chinese should cost!

I ordered the Beef and had a chunk the size of a hotdog in my to go order. Plus I gagged at the fat content. The sweet and sour shrimp is so so, but the coating is a little undercooked. 

I would suggest trying a Chinese restaurant that has more than 15 reviews ;-)"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning and when I called to speak to their manager they hung up and refused to answer my phone calls.. awful!"}
{"text":"This place isn't as great as it used to be i prefer China Gourmet. they changed many ingredients and it honestly isn't too good any more"}
{"text":"Every time we are in Las Vegas we make it a point to stop here to eat.
HUGE potions,
Lunch starts at 6.99,
Great customer service"}
{"text":"At $5.95 for a huge lunch portion and $7.25 for the combo including a drink this food would be a steal even it were cardboard. Alright, that isn't entirely true but this is your typical fast food Chinese. No matter what anyone says this is 100 times tastier and healthier than eating the MSG soaked Panda Express garbage. The service is quick and friendly and the portions are huge. Oh, and the food itself wasn't the worst. My stomach approves!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Awesome food. The price isn't too bad. You get what you pay for! And in this case... The food is wayyy over the top. It's amazing the quality of food for the price. The cashier always kept checking on us to see if we were doing okay, always a +1. The service was fast and the food was so fresh. I think their food is made to order and not pre-cooked (like Panda Express.) Id rather eat here and spend the extra dollar or two and receive tasty steamy hot food (even if I have to wait a couple minutes more) it's worth the small wait and worth the small price difference."}
{"text":"Ughh I just went in to try and order, as I see one of the cooks run to restroom and I hear him barging super loud! Then he walks out and just \" working just fine!! Wtf? I will be calling health district ASAP!! Yuckkkk 
Oh and hubby and I walked out of there!"}
{"text":"Very delicious ! Come and bring your family. Best chicken fried rice in Las Vegas. I've been to 3 China a go go's and this is the best one hands down. Very peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"This establishment is garbage. The food doesn't taste good, the noodles taste like cardboard. Save your money and your calories."}
{"text":"I just ordered from here for the first time and ordered delivery. They were so fast and the food was still nice and hot! Great food quality and lots of it. We will definitely be ordering from this location more often!"}
{"text":"I was super skeptical about eating here after reading some of these reviews. But it wasn't that bad. The food wasn't anything to write home about but it was still good. Satisfying and filling. Loved the mango boba!"}
{"text":"I always get the BBQ pork fried rice, bbq pork and a few other delights.
I usually have it delivered, when arrived still hot and tasty 
If you dine in, room is limited but there is a thrifty ice cream shop down the walk way."}
{"text":"There is a significant lack of Chinese food offerings in the Southern Highlands area, let alone a place that will deliver. China a GoGo is a decent fast casual restaurant and hits the spot.

I usually order the combination egg foo young which is surprisingly better than a lot of others I've tried elsewhere. I also like the Crispy Hong Kong Style Noodles. It's flavorful and a decent portion.

My favorite thing about the place is their speedy service! I love how I'd usually get my order delivered in less than 20 minutes even during dinner rush time! They have never gotten my order wrong and are always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My go to Chinese place. Everything we've tried so far has been good."}
{"text":"Very good and clean place. Their service is super fast even when it's with a large party. I'm sure there are better Chinese places but if you want something good and fast this is the place."}
{"text":"-confession- 
I've been here 3 times in the last week.

It's very fast and convenient. My family and I can be pretty lazy and this has been our go-to. We always order mapo tofu and fried rice. Considering my dad has Chinese blood in him, he enjoys it. Honestly, it could be a hit or miss... not terrible, just mediocre I guess.

Service: 3 out of 5
They are straight to the point. I respect them for it considering you don't expect great service at Asian restaurant anyway. It's just not in their blood, just saying. Grab your food and go. Honestly no need to small talk. They've never gotten my order wrong. That's important!

Convenience: 5 out of 5
I've called right after I got off work on multiple occasions to order, 10 to 15 minutes later, my food was ready for pick up. They also deliver if you're in the neighborhood (3 miles radius to be exact) with a minimum of $15 order and $2 delivery fee. Doesn't that sound convenient when you're super lazy? I think so! 

Food: 4 out of 5
Like I said in the beginning, it can be a hit or miss. I tried mapo tofu for the first time here and fell in love. I've had it again and again. Sometimes, I eat the whole thing and want more. Sometimes, it doesn't feel worth it or as good as before. Not the worst, not the best, just MEH. If you know what I mean... lol.

Overall: 4 out 5 stars
Why? 
When I'm hangry or in a crunch, they've got my back. I would probably always recommend you pick up or deliver over dining it. But that's just me."}
{"text":"This place was so so. The menu is a bit confusing and doesn't tell you what you get with certain dishes. I asked for something with shrimp, rice, and vegetables and I'm told the Kung pow shrimp would be my best bet. I order that only to find out there's nothing really kung pow about it at all. Hardly any flavor. I ate what I could and it was followed by a really bad stomach ache not too long after. Not too sure I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken teriyaki, delivery was very quick but was very disappointed with the teriyaki..it didn't really have much taste to it. It was very plain and I basically just threw it away after 3 bites.. Customer service was ok but food was terrible.. Never again!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the delivery was slow. I love their wor wonton soup. I will order from them again."}
{"text":"This place has a great LUNCH menu until 4pm.  Get soup and a slightly smaller portion for a much $$ better price.  Food is really fresh and good! If you are a regular, they usually give you free fried egg rolls.  They love Seniors!!"}
{"text":"Hubby didn't want to drive so we decided to try out China a Go Go since they do delivery and we had the flyer on top of the pile of ads we were going to dump in our recycling bin.

I ordered the crispy orange beef and hubby ordered the twice cooked chicken.  We also ordered crab Rangoon.  Our order amounted to a free 4 eggrolls and the wonton chips were complimentary.

Sounds like a good deal, but the food was not so great.  My crispy orange beef was not crispy but plain chewy.  No bueno.  My hubby didn't enjoy his chicken.  The eggrolls were filled with cheap veggies.  The crab Rangoon and wonton chips tasted like how it should...yay.

A few weeks later, hubby had the twice cooked chicken again, but he dined in during lunch and he told me that it tasted decent when he ate it there.  

My conclusion:  Don't order to go if you want decent food at this place."}
{"text":"They have the biggest shrimp inside of the shrimp fried rice. And shrimp and broccoli is very generous. They chicken was so delicious. Not really expensive."}
{"text":"I want to give it a 3 1/2 stars. I came to pick up a To go order. I made the order on Yelp. It was very convenient.

Located near Sushi Bomb, and Walmart shopping centre.

I was craving for Chicken wings with sesame sauce and Seafood Hot & Sour Soup.

The food was waiting for me not long after I made the order online. They seem to be fast and efficient.

Chicken wings were tasty but was too sweet for me and the Seafood hot and sour soup was good but not spicy enough. I want to try the wings original with no sauces next time.

The restaurant has some seatings and the place looked clean. I noticed they have awesome lunch specials ranging from $6.45-$7.35) until 4:30pm. The entree comes with half rice and half chow mein and you can choose all rice or all chow mein.  

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, close to my house. Always satisfied with everything I ordered from this place."}
{"text":"I order the basic cashew chicken, fried rice, egg rolls and egg drop soup for us. The food was kind of watery with barely any flavor."}
{"text":"We order from here all of the time! Quick delivery, awesome choices, and 99% of the time our food is amazing. 

I give them 4 stars because sometimes they lack in consistency."}
{"text":"We ordered multiple different plates.  Most of the veggies were over cooked. The rice noodle plate had a small amount of veggies. Over all my family ate a giant pile of salt. We're gonna throw the left overs away and we will never be back. 
So if you like highly salty, greasy and over cooked food this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. However, they are not clear about cross contamination. 

Very good service though and the ambiance is amazing!! The prices are not too bad, but I wish the portion sizes were just a little bit bigger. 

The taste of the food is phenomenal! But because of them not being clear about cross contamination, I almost died eating the won ton soup because they added shrimp. I'm allergic to shrimp and I let them know that. They still brought out a bowl of soup with shrimp with no regard as to what I had mentioned to them."}
{"text":"DELIVERY NOT TRUSTWORTHY- waited 1 hour and 10 minutes* Big disappointment*

Ordered food tonight with my Man at 8:49pm hence they close at 9:30pm. So,we made sure it was okay to order food given the time.
 The guy on the phone said it is still okay to place order for delivery  -we were quoted 15 minutes after placing the order.  We waited outside for the delivery- it didn't come. We called them at 9:25 getting concerned about the closing time. They said wait 10 more minutes. We waited and by 9:45pm we called back and got an answering machine. We decided to head over there. We caught 2 of them leaving the shop at 10:00pm. We told them that they were not very honest with us and that they better be sure to refund the debit transaction that they hit us up for and that we will eat dinner elsewhere. We do not trust that the food was even safe to eat. Did they spit in it and screw us over and make us wait an hour and ten minutes because they don't give a shit about the business they work for and the customers? How can we trust them??
The delivery guy was calling my cell phone at 10:02 while we were actually at China A Go Go, He was claiming he was at our home-but we were not trusting that he was truly at the house since they gave us the run around already with the time frame and lack of communication & lack of accuracy on delivery time that we were quoted. We are very disappointed in this bad service and will reach out to the owners to inform them of what happened. We came home to the food on the porch after we ate at Taco Bell. WHAT THE HECK??? If they deny us a refund i will be reporting them to the BBB ( Better Business Bureau)."}
{"text":"The sauce for the mongolian beef is really good. The lunch specials are inexpensive and they load em up! :)"}
{"text":"I was for years costumer here but I stop coming because of the costumer services sometime they are ok and another they see you really bad. Then I just star ordering to go  but we stop coming. Today we were hungry and decided to come and order food to go, we wait 45 minutes waiting they didn't turn on the ac like 25 minutes waiting. I get 4 lunch special plus a crab Rangoon, they give me one little container 1/2 way with sweet and sour. I give back the bunch of soya souse they give me and ask for sweet and sour the way they are half way full I need at leas 4 of those for the crab Rangoon it self. I ask for more they ask $1. I just live. At home they don't put no utensils or any napkins. 
I give 2 stars because the food still ok but the service so bad, I remembered wen I come to this place and the 2 guys in the picture attend you if you wait to much they give you something in the house or give you cup to drink something in this weather, so sad the waitress feel like owners any way I am not coming back so sad."}
{"text":"The brown rice and egg white fried rice is fantastic.  It's not on the menu, so look for the posters on the cash registers.  Or just ask about it."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome Chinese. I'm usually skeptical about finding a new place, but this place was excellent. Ordered delivery and it was at our door piping hot in 13 minutes!!! Beef and broccoli had plenty of sauce and the broccoli was cooked perfect for how we like it! Chicken fried rice was delicious as well and the chicken wonton were superb! Online ordering makes it even easier!!! Will be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Always great quality and good tasting! The service is great and employees are pleasant. I eat here often. Favorites include combo rice and egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried a lot on the menu because I can't get past the two things that I have to order every time... The lettuce wraps and the Go Go wings. I get the wings super spicy... Have never been disappointed both items are on point!"}
{"text":"Small portions and overpriced. The typical \"Vegas\" substandard Chinese food quality that most of the Chinese restaurants in Vegas tastes like. They always dona careless job packaging take out food that something is always leaking by the time you get home. Ordered from here a few times because its the closest one to me but this will be the last time. I can honestly say I can cook better."}
{"text":"Great good food and the prices are good ! My favorite combo fried rice ! Place is always nice and clean and welcoming. Also boba is great and good !"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the neighborhood and were craving Chinese. We decided to stop by. My husband said it's better than Panda and I agree. It's delicious. I was most impressed with the orange chicken, it was all chicken lightly breaded, unlike panda or other places that when u take a bite your like where's the chicken?.. The staff was friendly, hospitable, attentive, and the portions were good. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years but it's more of a occasional visit kind of place for me. Usually when I stop in, I'll go for the salt and pepper shrimp or the black bean fish fillet, both of which are pretty grubbin. I used to really love the shrimp here but the quality of the shrimp is suffering lately so I've stayed away. Usually when I'm not in the mood for eating shrimp or fish, the Buddha's delight is a pretty good option as well. The food isn't super stellar but the servers are nice, food portions are big, and the service is quick.

Overall, china a go go is a quick eat when I'm in the mood. Not too bad for A Chinese place on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great food and prices; we will be ordering from here quite commonly. For the price it's hard to beat - and I spent over half a year in China. The portions are generous and taste very good. Recommend!"}
{"text":"If you want someone to not understand your order at all and ask that you repeat it 5 times with everything thing you ask for. Read it back to you and then come later and be like, oh I got your order wrong."}
{"text":"Better than Panda Express. Servers are friendly :) will come back again for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Worst Honey Walnut shrimp I've ever had. All you can is the soggy batter. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times and I have enjoyed my experience each time I've gone. Their food is really good and their service is excellent. Food is generally made quickly and I was always made to feel welcome. I love Egg Fu Young and theirs is good. 
I cannot really recommend this restaurant for selfish reasons because if everyone new how good this place was, there would be even more people there to pick up eats. Thank you to the staff for always providing good services..."}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery from here through EAT24.

The lunch specials on the EAT24 site clearly says it comes with \"a choice of rice AND chow mein\". When you click on the lunch special, it gives you an option of choosing between steamed rice and fried rice. Based on common knowledge of the English language, that means you get to pick the type of rice you want AND you will also get a standard chow mein.

The food did not come with chow mien. Called the store to correct it, the lady said it was MY FAULT since the order said rice only. You programmed your menu on this site and advertised that the dish comes with both rice AND chow mein. How is it my fault that the program only prompts the choice of rice?? Was I supposed to add the note \"Hey, I'd really like to have the chow mein that already comes with your lunch special with the rice choice you also offered.\"?? The receipt clearly shows the word \"lunch\" at the end of the item, you'd think they would know what comes with their own lunch special.

She refused to do anything to correct the error and stood firm that it was my fault that my receipt didn't say chow mien under the lunch special items. HA! What a joke.

The food itself was another experience. Corn egg flower soup was so bland, it was practically just water and cornstarch warmed up. Never had dry orange chicken until now.

Not ordering again from this shady business who won't deliver what they advertise. Awful customer service and sub par food. Thanks. For. Nothing."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken Pad Thai, orange chicken, dumplings, shrimp fried rice and white rice. We live less than 10 minutes from this location. When I got the food home the white rice was cold and tasted like cleaner, they made the Pad Thai with dark chicken and red onions so it was super greasy, the orange chicken was tough and the fried rice was dry. 

But that is par for the course.

Why I am giving a bad review is that after I called I was told that since we didn't IMMEDIATELY eat everything that it should be expected to be not tasty and basically the girl I talked to didn't care.

Needless to say I will NOT return."}
{"text":"I order online and when I call and told them I am missing items, they told me I am so sorry we will give it to you next time when you order, first it took almost an hour to place my order, the person taking the order can hardly speak English never order online they are Idiots, like really do you really think I will order again, Chinese people are Idiots."}
{"text":"My favorite chow mein is from China a go go, haven't had a better noodle than theirs yet. I recommend the orange chicken. 

Best Chinese food on the east side!"}
{"text":"Ordered the snow pea shrimp and Mongolian beef yesterday and they were super fresh! Also they gave us free donuts and wonton strips. Today I got a bubble tea and got another for free! I'm so happy there is good fast food Chinese finally near my home."}
{"text":"Excellent - my favorite fast Chinese, try the spicy garlic beaf and the veggie egg foo young! Fast friendly service and highly skilled cooks. Glad you guys are close to my new home!"}
{"text":"finally ate at the new location on rainbow. I ordered chicken chow mien and Mongolian beef. the noodles were on point but didn't care for the chicken added. the beef wasn't as spicy as the description says so I had to add more sriracha but it had a good flavor"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. Needs more vegetables or I would give them a 5. Great service, clean place, large portions."}

{"text":"6/11/2017  I revisited China A Go Go after several years and enjoyed the food and experience.  I ordered a large bowl of Hot and Sour Soup and it came with some seafood ingredients and was pretty good.  I think I would have enjoyed the plain Hot and Sour Soup just as well and will try it on my next visit.  I also ordered the Lunch Special Hot Garlic Chicken with added Snow Peas and I had to request a to go box because I was full with only eating a small portion of the Hot Garlic Chicken.  It was fresh and tasty.  With my drink which was refilled 3 times, my bill was $17.09.  I could have ordered only one item and been satisfied.  The wait staff was pleasant, quick to refill my drink and to ask if everything was okay and ask if I needed anything.  I would recommend this place for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and flavorful food."}
{"text":"The salt and pepper shrimp was very good. We had the garlic chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and cashew chicken. The portions were generous. The  service was fast and friendly would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Considering we are in Vegas and so far away from the Ocean, I wanted to see where they get their fish (sashimi) shipped from. So, I asked our waitress, and she literally had no clue. First of all it took me a good 5 minutes to ask her the question, because she couldn't understand what I was asking.  Had to rephrase my questions multiple times, trying to dumb down the words for her to understand and when she finally did, she still didn't know. #1 mistake! She obviously didn't know how to speak proper English, which was upper annoying. So for that reason I didn't order their sashimi. So, I went with Calamari, came out alright... I've had much better though. but there was absolutely no dipping sauce. I asked her for the sauce, (which also took her a while to understand), and all she offered me for the tempura sauce.. .all wrong! In my experience, I usually get the aioli sauce. Then I figured okay.. they can't mess up miso soup, that's pretty fool proof right!? WRONG! Got is completely watered down, and it had no seaweed in it! a pretty important ingredient to miso soup! Overall a terrible experience, will never come back here again. Some words of advice to the owners: get english speaking staff who are able to answer simple  questions, and also put some damn seaweed into your miso soup! Oh also, they're not JUST Chinese, they're also Japanese (serve sushi), and hawaiian bbq! Maybe the restaurant should focus on one thing at a time and perfect it first before expanding! Terrible..."}
{"text":"I made a yelp just to review these people. Their sushi house SUCKS, their customer service is HORRIBLE!!!! First time I went the girl was completely rude, no thank you, no clearing the table, or checking if we wanted more. We were so unhappy. I went a second time just because it's down the street from me thinking maybe it was the server who was horrible. But they were horrible again!!! They messed up our order and when we asked to fix it they started yelling in Chinese and being rude to my family and I. Very unprofessional, I would never yell at someone in a language they don't understand. Please drive the extra mile and go elsewhere, their service and sushi suck!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as China a go go I usually go to but still ok. green valley location is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in years. But was in the area so I stopped in. Still the best China a go go I have been to. They were the first in town before they franchised out...General/ House special chicken lunch special is all I ever order!!!"}
{"text":"Living in many different smaller and larger cities across the United States I have tasted really disgusting to alright to excellent Chinese food.This restaurant does not have just alright Chinese food as they have disgusting Chinese food. I am not a big fan of Panda express as they have better tasting items on there menu than this place. I ordered the Twice Cooked Chicken and I took a few bites and I almost threw up. I also tried the Spicy Garlic Chicken and I was not impressed either.If you want decent Chinese I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Food was average and way overpriced. Service was great though. Decent Chinese food if you live in the neighborhood and want something quick."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town. Best China a go go in town! Love everything on their menu. Staff is friendly. Portion is huge!! And 7 out of 9 of the times, I seem to get something extra for free. Egg rolls or donuts or cream cheese ragoons. I always order the pork fried rice honey Walnut shrimp With chai boba tea."}
{"text":"Great service, very affordable price, and tasty. The staff was very friendly and giving. They gave me a free drink and egg rolls with a coupon I received in the mail. Seemed pretty authentic to me as every worker in the store seemed to be from China. The affordable price, friendly and catering service, and taste will bring me back again."}
{"text":"China go go to go over one of my favorite Chinese restaurant on W. Charleston Blvd. I just cited to try them as it was convenient on my way home from work for pick up. The food was terrible, the wor wonton soup had no variety of vegetables and meat in it, fried rice had no flavor and the meet was very tough. I don't think I'll be going back to this location ever again. I don't remember China a gogo from years ago having such bad food. Maybe it's just this location?"}
{"text":"This place is consistent w their quality and accuracy. We always order here to go and our kids love it. We love the honey walnut shrimp, HK noodles, orange chicken, crab rangoon.!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad order in 8 years. It's Chinese Take out. And it is always hot and fast."}
{"text":"Just got our food from this place for the first time. Arrived super fast! We got egg rolls. I expected them bigger for the price, but they were delicious! We also got wonton soup, garlic chicken and chicken teriyaki. Everything was fresh and delicious, will order again! Thank you, guys, for outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Order the honey walnut shrimp and dip it in sweet and sour sauce so GOOD! I love that they deliver as well !"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here alot in the past but food is great love the soup now on to why I gave a bad review 2 times now I've ordered recently and the driver won't get out of his car he calls me to go out to the street to get my food what the hell I ordered food to be delivered to my door not to the street"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food at a Great price. Love the Kung pao chicken! When I first walked in I was greeted by a friendly girl she took my order to the table and asked me if I needed anything. They give you a generous amount I couldn't even finish it! They also deliver!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with our meals. We ordered two orders of orange chicken, twice cooked spicy chicken and Szechuan beef. The chicken had a lot of gristle and bones and the color of my twice cooked chicken was a horrible shade of brown and the texture of the orange chicken was very strange. I asked for veggies to be added to the spicy chicken and they weren't. The beef wasn't bad, but it was definitely mediocre at best. I have tried this place several times, but this last time was inedible and we ended up throwing all the chicken dishes away and eating cheese and crackers for dinner:( I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Normally this place is really good but today there service was wack!
Everyone is on their cellphone instead of taking care of their customers quality of food was not good either don't know if I'll ever come back I'm very picky when comes to my food you mess it up once and we're pretty much done!"}
{"text":"Just moved into Southern Highlands and had hoped my local Chinese place would have good or at least decent food. I left two stars instead of one because I did not vomit. I'm sorry but they really need a new cook.
I decided to leave this review in hopes that the owner would see it and strive to improve the taste of the food. 
We do not have many food options out here in Southern Highlands so please please please improve the quality of your food."}
{"text":"I must say they have some pretty yummy food here. Love the Pork Fried Rice, the Wonton Soup, and the Sesame chicken. We order the family deals and they give us a lot of food for a pretty good price. The Salt and Pepper wings are pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good flavor. Large lunch portions. I'd give it five stars but they serve everything in styrofoam which is just sad."}
{"text":"I order on line to deliver they are so fast and the won ton soup is hot delicious when sick with flu. Love this place"}
{"text":"Easily becoming one of my favorite places to eat. Staff are friendly and take good care of their customers."}
{"text":"I eat here probably once a week.  It's just good, fast, cheap food with hearty portions and great flavor.  Plus the people who run it totally rock!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Amazing service. Always enjoy my meal. I come to eat lunch here atleast once a week.  Never disappoint. I recommend sesame beef plate, orange chicken and general tso chicken"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and amazing service! On top of that it's always clean since the first day I came here. The staff is very eager to work together to make sure my orders have been timely. I normally order togo so I appreciate the speediness! Thanks for making every experience awesome."}
{"text":"You can just taste the freshness in their meat and veggies and their customer service is probably the best I've ever received from a Chinese restaurant - my server was so sweet, polite and attentive AND he had a sense of humor! Look, I'm from San Francisco: I know good quality Chinese-American food when I taste it and this is great quality food! Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fantastic! Be careful though...portions are huge, especially the kids menu. Everything is very flavorful, it's not covered in goo, veggies are crispy and fresh. Fast, friendly service. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wow just got off the phone because I wasn't able to place my order on there web site and low behold while placing my order the price was completely wrong they told me is what they charge and the price online don't matter its just wrong, well I asked them to give me the price that was listed on line and asked for a manger there was none available so he just told me he couldn't help. What great service to get."}
{"text":"For me China a Go Go was an okay place to eat today.  The place was very clean and our server was very attentive.  However, the main part of any review comes down to mostly the food.  I ordered the Orange Chicken special for $5.95 and as good as the price was my chicken tasted like vinegar.  Sadly I probably won't come back.  :("}
{"text":"Always good. Always on time or early. Food is always hot. It's almost like the delivery guy is cooking it while he's driving, lol. I don't know how they do it. Best Chinese take out in Las Vegas, for sure. Potstickers are just like they should be. Chow Fun is always good & I love the hot & sour soup. You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Good fast food chinese food. Great prices too. Hubby and I ordered the combo fried rice and general tso chicken. Spot on! But the real winner is the foil wrapped chicken in the appetizer. So flavorful!!! 

Stop in if you're in the mood for quick chinese food that also has great taste!"}
{"text":"It's not the best Chinese I've ever had but it's really decent. The only iffy thing I've had is the egg Foo Yung. It's OK. But that's the worst of it. They are really friendly aaaand you can order online. Huge plus.  
It's well worth the speed, convenience and price."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THE SUSHI PLACE THEY JUST BUILT INSIDE!!!!! It's disgusting and horrible customer service. I just got here and once I was seated a girl asked us for our drinks. We ordered water and were given tap water-whatever. So I asked which rolls were baked and they only had 2. The ice mountain and frying Jason. They're exactly the same thing except one has asparagus in it. I didn't like the ice mountain and the server refused to take it back and the frying Jason is still sitting at the table. And then, she comes with the caterpillar roll which we didn't order. She begins to argue with us \"YES YOU DID\" and then the table next to us says it was theirs. She brought them a crunch roll which they didn't order, and she says \"here it's good\" and makes them eat it. So far she has been rude and honestly wasn't even worth the $20.  Definitely never coming back and going to Yama or Kaya instead. 

UPDATE: she's ruder. NO WHERE on the menu does it say that you will be charged for every roll you hate and don't wanna finish. She told us we would be charged unless we finished the nasty rolls so we're basically being tortured."}
{"text":"I was super excited due to all the amazing reviews. I place an order, using the eat 24 app, and it tells me it will be about a 45 minute wait. Nothing unusual, any time I order anything I expect about a 45 minute wait. 
47 minutes after I place the order I receive a phone call from the restaurant stating they were too busy to cook my order, would I be able to wait another 45 minutes? 
I asked ok so instead of calling me when I placed the order, you waited till it was supposed to arrive to call and ask me to wait the same amount of time I already have?
The gentleman said we were too busy to call you and haven't even made your order but if you will wait another 45 minutes we will make it and get it to you. 
I stated that doesn't seem like very good customer service. 
He said well do you want it or no?

I was appalled! Obviously they do not value the delivery business. 
Thankfully eat 24 will be finding a better more customer friendly restaurant to offer to customers rather then one that can't staff respectful customer service friendly people."}
{"text":"For a primarily take-out Chinese restaurant, they're great! They have a large selection of food, the prices are fair, and I think it tastes better than a huge Chinese restaurant down the road on S. Eastern Ave. 

The portions for lunch and take-out are big, the cashier, dine-in workers, and cooks work fast and are dialed, and they are friendly to me. One young female employee in the dining area doesn't do anything but check her phone, so hopefully the rest of the crew will square her away ASAP. (That kind of lazy, no initiative behavior is bad for business)

I'll be back whenever I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"Everyone has their own opinions of what \"kind\" of Chinese they prefer. This one, is not mine. 

Although the staff were friendly, the food was not as good as some other Chinese restaurants I've experienced in this town. 

I ordered egg rolls and the mongolian beef lunch special. First - the spring rolls. Now when I envision a delicious spring roll I see a delicate wrapper with shredded goodness on the inside. Light, flavorful. These were the opposite. The wrapper was SO thick, it felt like I was chewing on two of them, not just one. And the \"shredded veggies\" on the inside, were not shredded. They were chopped up and extremely thick, the veggies were hard as well, as though they hadn't been cooked well. It was too much to chew. The \"spicy mustard\" they gave to me was in a packet and was not hot AT ALL. It was like regular mustard. Yuck. 

The mongolian beef was good but again, the slices of beef were enormous! They were not bite sized. They were double and triple bite sized. Definitely do NOT order this on a date because you will look like a velociraptor tearing into his meal. There was a lot of flavor, but also - a LOT of grease. The fried rice that went along with the meal was dry and tasteless. I only ate a couple of bites.

So overall, if you're looking for a quick meal with big portions and friendly staff - you've got it. If you're looking for refined taste and normal portions - you might want to try elsewhere. Sometimes, and this is one of those times, bigger isn't always better."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Kung pao chicken spicy & non spicy (kids love it too)!! Keep up the great recipe!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I love chinese food and instead of wasting money on buffet at asia, you should come here."}
{"text":"The people at this establishment are rude.  Their customer service skills are horrible. I called top order food and had forgotten the name of one of the things I always order so I asked the guy and he made a ride comment about if I order it all the time I should know the name and then wouldn't let me speak to a manager or tell me his name. I will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst China agogo because I gave I fully understand when accidents happen . You can't control when a piece of hair falls in the food . But I was the first order of the day . How do you ruin that . That's supposed to determine if you have a good day or not . Well I found hair in my food . First she said they could credit me money to eat there wtf. Credit me money to eat there again. So she thinks I'm going to eat food with hair in it then come later in the week with credits for free food fuck that . I asked for a refund and she starts speaking another language then says we'll give you 7 dollars I said what the fuck I gave you 15 dollars. She proceeds to tell me I paid \"online\" when I paid in cash. Then she says ok we'll give you refund but you have to give the food and drink back . Are you serious China agogo I'd be glad to return your dirty ass food . You think I was going to eat it and get my money back with hair in it"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the prices are really fair. I've been disappointed in the kung pao though. No matter how I order it I get it very spicy with Chinese red hot pepper and jalape√±o peppers, first time I've noticed that in Chinese food. I'll try again because everything else is so good. I don't want to order it mild - I like a little spice. On my last visit I had the pepper steak and bbq pork chow fun. The steak was so tender and delicious that I saved the chow fun for lunch the next day. Home run on that one! Don't plan on coming here for a nice sit-down meal. It's a plastic fork and paper plate place that could cut their floor space in half and just put in a drive thru. Almost all the business is to go or for delivery. Go somewhere else for ambiance, but this is the place for really good food at a really decent price."}
{"text":"We were driving around Henderson and we were hungry for something quick to eat.  Not being too familiar with this side of town we stumbled on China A Go Go for a quick lunch.

It's a casual place to grab a quick bite to eat.  Order and pay at the cashier, sit where you want, small little place with lots of take-out orders. Clean and friendly service. Lots of options and lunch combinations come with egg flower soup.  I ordered the beef with broccoli and a side of potstickers.  Wow! The potstickers were on steroids perfect if you're Fred Flinstone-too many, too big and they weren't all that great. The combo lunch was HUGE and could have easily shared. All very tasty.

Located in the Vons shopping center."}
{"text":"Picked up take out for pajama night at home!  

My husband was very dissapointed with the hot and sour soup.  Claims it was the worst he's had.

We also ordered string bean beef, chinese eggplant with tofu, combination chow mein, and a free BBQ sliced pork for spending $20.  The eggplant was the winner.  Huge portion and really good.  The string bean beef was tasty too, a bit salty.  The chow mein was ok.  Certainly not the best I've had.

Good thing the BBQ pork was free, it was awful. Flavorless, chewy, yuk.

It'll do the trick for chinese take out, it's not the best but it's cheap, hot, quick, and filling."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials... They give alot for just $5.95 includes corn egg drop soup with your meal!
I had the mangolian beef w/ white rice... beef was tender and tasty...  Definitely can be shared with 2 people."}
{"text":"While doing my banking next door the smells that come from this restaurant are intoxicating. I finally decided to give in and try the Chinese food here. I was impressed with the wonderful lunch specials that they offer, so many choices. The prices are so very reasonable too. 

The restaurant offers decor that is festive in the rich Chinese culture. The servers speak English but their primary language is a Chinese dialect. The staff is very friendly and even with the language barrier they understand the guest enough to get the order correct. Plus the menu is in color and has pictures that you can point to what you want. My order was prompt and made correctly the first time. 

I had the lunch special offerings of Beef and Broccoli which was delicious. And for extra an extra healthy choice later  ordered the Steamed Veggies special too. I figure since I will not eat all of it, l will have something healthy to snack on later. Sure enough I did not eat it all. The helpings are fairly large too. The steamed veggies were just right. My experience here was smooth and will visit again. Count on that."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot, I always get Kun pao chicken with white meat only!  Service is great never any issues!"}
{"text":"I know it's weird that an Asian person would like this place but I love china a go go. I always get the family dinner with fried rice, hot and sour soup, Kung pao chicken, and beef and broccoli. Their house special chicken is good too, it's like general tsao's chicken or spicy orange chicken. It also comes with a couple egg rolls and rangoons. After tax it's like $29 bucks and can feed a lot of people. If you split them up into Panda Express boxes they'd fit 4 meals generously.


The food is always fresh and good. Idk how authentic \"Chinese\" it is is but it is the perfect hang over food for me lol"}
{"text":"So I don't normally have chinese food, but my husband and I have barely eaten all day and wanted a 'cheat' meal. We wanted fast Chinese food - and China A Go Go definitely fit the bill. 

When I called, I ordered orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and fried rice. The women on the phone hung up before I was finished ordering which was rude. When we arrived - which was only a few minutes later, the food was ready to go in the bag. The total was $30. I thought that was a little pricey for 2 entrees and 1 side of rice, especially at a hole in the wall Chinese joint. Well, later I got an advertisement in the mail that was giving a deal - no coupon needed - for exactly what I got for $22. They didn't even offer that to me so that's why they get a 2 star..."}
{"text":"We tried this place recently.  I've been there twice for lunch specials.  The table service is excellent.  Quick and friendly.  The food is cooked to order making it instantly better than 3/4 of the fast food Chinese joints in town.  The fried rice is perfect.  The noodles are some of the best I've had - they are thicker noodles not the really thin ones that are more common.  The egg drop soup had just the right balance of salt and chicken flavor.

Prices are reasonable.  Two complete lunch dinners with shrimp was around $15."}
{"text":"We've ordered food from this location twice and it's been excellent both times. When we ordered the lunch special, I was surprised to see how much food was included. They've even thrown in small samples of appetizers for free :) Awesome food and customer service!"}
{"text":"It was really good , definitely might come back but it wasn't great ! Only thing I didn't like is that they bring everything separately . Like my rice was on the table 5 minutes before my mongoean beef ."}
{"text":"Always get the yummy food delivered. This was the first time to dine in. Love the food, the booths and tables! The music is hilarious but adds to the ambience. The food is plentiful and piping hot when it's brought to your table! I use Grub Hub when we order in and the food is just as delicious as the dine in!"}
{"text":"First and foremost: Like most take out Chinese food restaurants, this is a western style Chinese food restaurant. If you come on here to gripe on how \"unauthentic\" it is, you need your head checked.

I've been eating here for years. It's family owned and run and the food is not only cooked super quick, it's cooked well and priced just right!!!

My personal fave is their cashew chicken, which I order extra spicey. The sauce is wonderful, there's a prefect balance of chicken and veggies, and they don't skimp on the cashews!

Their hot'n sour soup is also a welcome surprise as it comes with big chunks of imitation crab and shrimp.

Are you eating alone and hate left overs building up in your fridge? They do half orders on most of their menu items for $6 with a side of rice. I'm 5'9\" and 165lbs, and one half order fills me up just fine.

The only problem I have is that one of the dudes working the cash register can be a little impatient, but I find the rest of the staff super friendly."}
{"text":"Frequent China a GoGo for lunch.   I find the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place for years. Alwsys good quality at reasonable prices with faster than normal delivery"}
{"text":"The best me and my wife have had in Vegas. The trick here is order the full order and tell them how you want it. We had the pork fried rice extra dark lots of soy and hot 
we had the Chow Mein hot and well done and the orange flavored chicken extra crispy and you guessed it HOT! The services is always great the staff is so friendly and the place is clean I can not ask for more"}
{"text":"Worst Meal.  Wife insisted we stop, we ate only a little of both our dishes.  Was Garbage !!  General Tao Chicken was just Ok, my HK Noodles Sucked.  Too much sauce, bland taste, and worst of all the Meat Quality was Poor !!   I can't eat that low grade beef and chicken, that is what i give my dog to eat.  MSG Loaded."}
{"text":"This is one place that you shouldn't let the looks on the outside deceive you.  We were quickly seated and they immediately served our drinks before we even got settled in. Their menu is huge and there is so much to choose from. We ordered 2 lunch orders of Orange Chicken with fried rice, large order. Of Kung Pao beef with white rice, and side of Cream Cheese Wontons. All of these dishes were huge and very large portons. Even the lunch specials were very good size, 2 could share that meal. The service was nice and they were very attentive with refills. 
I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese food and this was actually a very good place to eat. I already recommended it to family and I have every intent to eat there again."}
{"text":"good Chinese food is hard to find in LV especially being from Cali, the only good thing about this place is that it's close to my house and it's similar to Panda express except its made to order.  I usually have to add a lot of chili oil and soy sauce to my orders to give it more flavor but besides that, all I can say is that it's 5 mins from my house which is a plus when I'm craving chinese and don't want to drive to chinatown (spring mtn)"}
{"text":"Love this place. We always order from them every Thanksgiving and Christmas, and the experience with them is always outstanding. The food is always ready on time for me to easily pick it up. They always bag it up perfectly so that nothing ever leaks in my car. I always get the beef chow fun and it's always been created with the perfect amount of sauce and seasoning. Another favorite is the eggplant tofu. It comes covered in sauce but do not be afraid; they've added the perfect amount of seasoning so it's not too salty at all. I also ordered the Singapore noodles today. Definitely recommend if you've ever tried it before, it was just a little dry today since I picked up the food a little late. TLDR: I'm a regular at this place and will continue ordering from here since the food is always outstanding and fast."}
{"text":"Really good this evening. Try one of the family meals, it a ton of food. We enjoy the freshness and being able to see the clean kitchen area. A+"}
{"text":"Great to go food when you don't have time to cook spicy though and consistency is a plus along with being convienent"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is pretty bad.  This place was so good about a year ago.  Customer service has gone out the window."}
{"text":"Love coming here. The food is great and it's always clean inside. I definitely recommend coming during lunch specials as it's so reasonable $6.95 for a entree fried rice and chow mein."}
{"text":"Been coming here since my wife introduced me to China go go since we were dating in 2012. Very attentive, fast service great food especially lunch specials for under $10 comes with soup, these winton appetizer and the entree large enough for 2 people. Now they have all you can eat sushi for $20 that's an unbeatable price!!!! My kids love this place too and they are very very nice to us sometimes their english is broken but as long as they continue treating my family good and cooking really good food then I am their customer"}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly. The prices are great, and the good is very good. You get a good size portion and your entree also comes with miso soup. For a mini chicken katsu (chicken, rice, veggies, and macaroni salad incl.), miso soup, and a drink, the total came to $7.81. We had a large group and they didnt seem stressed about it, they even gave us a large order of rangoons for free! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through eat24 and an hour had passed and I hadn't gotten my food. I called the restaurant and they said that I would have to call eat24 to get my money back. Luckily I had selected that I would pay with cash so I was able to reorder my food through the restaurant themselves. Even though this was not their fault, they apologized many times and gave me 2 egg rolls on the house! This was not necessary but greatly appreciated. 

I ordered pad thai with beef. This dish was okay. It tasted heavy on the egg. I also ordered the orange chicken. This was delicious!! The egg rolls were good too! And they delivered super fast, which was great! I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Sometimes China A Go Go gets a bad reputation for being dirty.  I've never found that to be the case at any location.  I've been eating here for years and I have come to expect consistently good food and service.  It is not uncommon for me to go into China A Go Go, place a to go order and be offered a complimentary beverage while I wait.  It never takes terribly long either. 10 or 15 minutes max.  I am always pleased with the amount of food I get.  I am sure to never go hungry when eating here.  My usual order(s) are mushu chicken, orange chicken, garlilc chicken, beef with brocoli or mongolian beef.  Sometimes I'll get a noodle dish like chicken chow fun or Singapore curry noodles.  Everything I ever get is always good.  From time to time I do get egg foo young.  This was never my favorite Chinese dish growing up as I do not care for eggs 9 times out of 10.  But here is different.  I love the egg foo young and its the gravy that makes it.  That stuff would make an old shoe taste good.  Not that the egg foo young tastes like an old shoe.  Its good on its own but stellar with the gravy.  I just want to make that clear.  The point is I've never had a bad experience here.  I've got my dad hooked on it and my grandparents really liked it too when I treated them to dinner after they drove me home from SoCal when Grey Hound over booked their bus and I could not get on.  Argh!  But that is another story in and of itself.  Lets bring the focus back to China A Go Go.  Its good Chinese food made by Chinese people unlike some other \"Chinese\" restaurants *cough* Panda Express *cough*"}
{"text":"Sometimes China A Go Go gets a bad reputation for being dirty.  I've never found that to be the case at this location or even the one on North Rainbow.  I've been eating here for years and I have come to expect consistently good food and service.  It is not uncommon for me to go into China A Go Go, place a to go order and be offered a complimentary beverage while I wait.  It never takes terribly long either. 10 or 15 minutes max.  I am always pleased with the amount of food I get.  I am sure to never go hungry when eating here.  My usual order(s) are mushu chicken, orange chicken, garlilc chicken, beef with brocoli or mongolian beef.  Sometimes I'll get a noodle dish like chicken chow fun or Singapore curry noodles.  Everything I ever get is always good.  From time to time I do get egg foo young.  This was never my favorite Chinese dish growing up as I do not care for eggs 9 times out of 10.  But here is different.  I love the egg foo young and its the gravy that makes it.  That stuff would make an old show taste good.  Not that the egg foo young tastes like an old shoe.  Its good on its own but stellar with the gravy.  I just want to make that clear.  The point is I've never had a bad experience here.  I've got my dad hooked on it and my grandparents really liked it too when I treated them to dinner after they drove me home from SoCal when Grey Hound over booked their bus and I could not get on.  Argh!  But that is another story in and of itself.  Lets bring the focus back to China A Go Go.  Its good Chinese food made by Chinese people unlike some other \"Chinese\" restaurants *cough* Panda Express *cough*"}
{"text":"emmmm i am a regular for about 1 year. I always order sesame chicken and I think they already know that. So every time they see me the they always smile and talk a little bit with me. I like this place.:)"}
{"text":"My first time to China A GoGo and the experience was pretty good. My wife had the Chow Mein and I had the Curry Chicken. I have been looking for some great curry that isn't the Thai food type with coconut milk. It was tasty and spicy just the way I like it. The Chow Mein was actually more of a Lo Mein, good but pretty typical. The Chow Mein could have had a bit more Beef, Chicken and Shrimp but my wife enjoyed every bite. I would love to try the Egg Foo Yung but nobody makes it better than me. China A GoGo, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I was having a lazy Sunday evening and decided to order take out from here last night. I called in my order to a very polite guy over the phone and was told my order would be ready in 15min. 

I was a regular at China A Go Go at a different location on the other side of town so I was interested to see how this food would hold up to the other spot. I was definitely not disappointed! They were pretty business when I walked in and the cashier told me that she was sorry but my order was running a bit behind. I don't mind waiting at all so I just sat down and patiently waited. 

This location is a bit smaller than the other ones I have been in but the food is still awesome. 

* Combo Fried Rice 5/5 had a good amount of large shrimp! 
* Sweet and Sour Pork 5/5 tasty! 
* General Tso Chicken 5/5 it's a little spicy but good. 
* Mongolian Beef 5/5 spicy brown sauce but so good. 

Since I had never been to this spot before I used the map provided by yelp and it's slightly off FYI. It took me a minute to find it. It shows it's next to the Metro PSC but it's not, instead it's the building over in the same parking lot next to the Dottys. 

Overall I was very happy with my food and will definitely be back when I'm craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"The tofu veggies had a good flavor but the tofu was mushie and weren't real fried. They did substitute my Thai tea for coconut milk which was nice, they were really nice and service was good."}
{"text":"This is a nifty little place to grab a quick lunch or quick bite in the afternoon. We really enjoy their chicken dishes. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"We order from them regularly for family parties and the food goes by quickly. I went in tonight and ordered fish fillet w/ black bean sauce, Buddha delight, and chow fun shrimp: all delish a go go! 

Oh, and I got the food super fast. I went to sit down and just when I got comfortable they handed me over the food! Wasn't even waiting for 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is awful. We really like China A Go Go, their food is fresh and good, the place is clean and they must be doing well because they added a sushi bar - we haven't tried their sushi. The service though seems to get worse every time we go, the waitresses are rude and off putting. We asked for the fried crisps and were told we could have them after we ordered (as if we would eat them and leave - a party of 8). We asked for silverware and she implied we pocketed a missing fork. Just poor manners."}
{"text":"First of all, it smelled great when u walk in. I got the combo chow mein. It has BIG thin strips of tender beef, good size chunks of chicken and a lot of big bite size shrimp! It was fresh, hot, and delicious. Now I have a tummy ache cause I couldn't stop eating and ate too much lol! Good local Chinese spot. They have lots of stuff like curries and pad Thai on the menu too. Will try those next time:)"}
{"text":"Loved their pad thai waz good and not too spicy. The eggrolls were crunchy and a bit over-cooked,  nevertheless,  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Got there at 9:30pm  and the place was busy.  Clean and the menu was straight forward. I ordered a quick bite of vegetable rolls (2), and they had almond cookies that took me back to my childhood.  I will definitely come back for the lunch entree.  A great addition to this side of town!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this was really bad. I ordered a teriyaki bow. The chicken  was soo dry and over cooked and didn't even have any of that brown seared grill marks. Needless to say so was the rice, vegetables, and orange chicken.  All dry. 

I poured large quantities of soy sauce to try and save it with no luck. I will say the chow mien was good though. 

I couldn't finish my food and hated to but had no choice to through most of it away. Sorry don't come here."}
{"text":"My family and I order from this place several times each month.  Their family special (appetizers, soup, 2 entrees, fried rice) and lunch entrees are always flavorful and hot upon arrival.  Although the workers are not as friendly as in some other restaurants, I really don't care about that, as long as they are polite (which they are).  The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great people, great service, food is always on point. These guys have delivered food for me minutes before they were supposed to close. Never had a problem other than I can't stop eating the food because it's so good. 

Give it a try it might be a chain but it still has a very genuine family run, friendly vibe to it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. It's your typical fast food Chinese American restaurant.  I really wanted noodles and China a Go Go was the closest restaurant to me at the time. I saw pictures of some noodles on here from another Yelper and I wanted it. 

We went in and ordered the Chicken Chow Mein. My daughter loves noodles so it was a win win for both of us. It was almost 7 bucks for this entree but me and my tot were both full after eating it. It wasn't too greasy or salty and the noodles were al dente. 

I've been back quite often for the noodles because I love carbs. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food this isn't the place to go. Sometimes the staff is hard to understand as they don't speak very good English but they understand enough for you to order. Overall, it's a good place if you need something quick to fill your belly."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with this restaurant!  We ordered delivery and the delivery guy arrived earlier than expected.  The food is very delicious!  We ordered Mu shu chicken, Hong Kong style Crispy noodles, Orange Chicken, Corn egg drop soup and Bbq pork with veggies.  Bbq pork is for dinner later on but the rest was very good.  It was not that salty but very tasty!  Great job guys!  We will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from this place and I've got to say, they're pretty consistent.

I've only ordered for delivery and the girl who has taken my order both times is easy to understand, even if her accent is heavy. She's always very polite and patient with me who always has a change of heart when ordering delivery mid-order (I know, I'm a terrible person) . They've also been very accommodating to my requests for items not on the menu (green beans in black bean sauce) and any modifications I have to an order (um, instead of the carrots, could I just get more cabbage?).. honestly.. I don't even know how these people put up with me.

Delivery is fast and everything comes ridiculously hot! I know the corn starched sauces help with that, but seriously.. it's like magic to me. This is not the most authentic Chinese you will ever have, but sometimes, I just crave that Americanized Chinese food that's almost like.. well.. fast food. I mean, at least half of the menu items are fried, and all are smothered in sauce. Delicious in an oh-so-comforting way.

So far I have tried:
-The hot and sour soup and as a previous reviewer stated.. it's not so hot. It was sort of bland and the texture was so viscous-y I stopped after a couple bites. On the plus side, it does have some seafood in there, including a chunk of imitation crab.. never seen that before.
-The sweet and sour shrimp arrived still crispy (no, really, how do they do it?!) with the sweet and sour sauce conveniently on the side. They have an interesting technique of preparing the shrimp in such a way that they turn into little rings when fried. Like a shrimp onion ring. Sort of difficult to eat, but the great thing about it is that since it's split in half, it's definitely clean and I appreciate that!
-The eggplant with fried tofu is a total win if you like fried tofu. I'm more of a silken tofu person myself, but the sauce on this was fantastic!
-The vegetable fried rice was so-so.
-Various fried goodies: crab rangoons (I couldn't stop eating them) were free with our order, egg rolls which are vegetarian and the boyfriend loved. They looked pretty standard, more like a spring roll. They also gave us a baggie of fried wonton strips. These were happily consumed by my boyfriend who judiciously declared them as his own. He put them to good use with the rest of the sweet and sour sauce from the shrimp.

Usually when we order we get way more than we can eat, and we spend around $40 when the tip is figured in. $20 p/p with a lot of leftovers? Yep, this is my go to for indulgent pajama night when I want to turn mushy on the couch."}
{"text":"First time ordering and the food was awesome.  Will definitely go back.  We had the orange chicken, General Tso's chicken and black pepper chicken.  All was great!"}
{"text":"No good! The potstickers were disgusting tasted like dough, the meat was somewhat flavorful but mushy, the rice was fine.. it really just wasn't good.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love love everything about china go go, from their menu selection to there ethentic Chinese cuisine, their prices and the fact that I always have one nearby every time I move, LOL.
This review is about the  online site is attached to yelp called eat 24, When u place your order for either delivery or pick up. My first time using it and definitely will not be my last. I truly loved it because you're able to tell it everything you want and not forced to charge it if you want to pay cash, which is always a great touch. I was quoted 45 to 60 minutes and it came 30 minutes later, They must knew I haven't eaten all day and was hungrywell, because it was a Monday evening and people are eating pizza and wings on Monday night football set of Chinese food. But who cares it's an amazing sight to use to make sure everything you need gets through without having to repeat yourself or sometimes the language Barrier gets in the way, on both ends."}
{"text":"Living nearby my local grocery store I wanted to grab some chinese that's not the usual Panda Express.  I didn't know what to expect but I decided to give it a shot anyway.
They have a lunch special until 4pm which consisted of your choice of entree with including egg drop soup and some fried chips of some sort. I ordered the orange chicken which was actually pretty good. Not breaded as much as the usual Chinese fast food, but the chicken inside was tender and juicy. Their chow mein wasn't anything special nor their rice was not anything out of the ordinary.
For the price and value, I would recommend this spot if you want a quick bite but not trying to break the budget."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go on an occasion! Never fails to amaze how quick and amazing their customer service is"}
{"text":"Egg corn flower soup was great as well as the BBQ Pork Ribs. The Pork Sweet and Sour not so much. Place looked clean and it had fast service. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful !!!! But the food is not on point at all;/ don't order the pad thai or pepper steak . The meat were all fatty . Ahhhhhh"}
{"text":"I love pretty much all China a Gogo but this location has the friendliest staff. I've been here multiple times and never had a bad experience. The soups are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Clean,food's great,employees are really nice & you can't beat their lunch special.been going here for years"}
{"text":"Thought that a nearby Chinese place would be great. Ordered a couple of items. My beef dish was okay, nothing great.  GF's shrimp were slimy. I tried one and was sick for the next two days.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! What do some people expect, PF Changs? Food is really good, hot, fast and super consistent. The crew running the restaurant is always eating at the restaurant; I like that. Yes the lobby is a bit run down but get past that and you will be happy with your visit."}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from this restaurant several times now, and the food is always good. Very consistent, fresh, my order is accurate, and the employees are accommodating."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery service from them last night.  I like that they do the family meals.  We generally order a couple things and then share between us, so it's pretty cool to already have in that format with a better price tag.  I thought it was very affordable and the portions were good.  The food was good, not exceptionally fantastic, but still really yummy.  I wasn't a fan of their fried rice, so I probably wouldn't order it again.

The delivery time though was fantastic and about 20 minutes less than what they told me it would be.  We would definitely order from there again.  =)"}
{"text":"I like the delivery service & their lunch menu. Nothing out of the ordinary but nothing super bad where I wouldn't  come back."}
{"text":"My go-to when I need fast delivery. I've tried multiple China A Go Go locations and this is one is the best one. Very clean and food is good! 

The specials are the best!
The lunch specials come with one entree, fried rice, and chow mein noodles. 

The personal dinner specials come with one entree, soup of the day, eggroll, crab rangoon, and your choice of steamed rice or fried rice. 

My favorite entrees from them are the sweet and sour pork, honey walnut shrimp, and sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"The place looked a bit messy and unclean. Took quite sometime to get our \"to go\" order regardless of two people behind 2 cash registers. The menu offers regular Chinese dishes. Nothing out of the ordinary.
We ordered only combination fried rice for 2 because we felt that something was wrong with the meals. My companion is a very relax and easy going person that can eat literally anything, however he suggested first to get only the fried rice orders because he perceived not a good vibe with the entire restaurant.
The food was edible, rice somehow overcooked. Portions very less than acceptable and we felt it was overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a few months now and it is the best one they haven't town, They're always so nice in never had an issue. Can't beat the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Very good! Inexpensive, get lunch menu items all the way till 4. It went well with the munchies I had :) Orange chik, fried rice and noodles. Noodles were only OK, so ill prolly just get rice next time. & I wanna try there skrimpppps!"}
{"text":"a lot of food for a reasonable price. always seem to get full without finishing the plate. the workers are friendly and i always keep coming back for their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Not bad for Chinese food since we were not from the area & still need to explore the different restaurants in this part of Vegas"}
{"text":"I love this location next to our house it's great service and the food is consistently good never changes"}
{"text":"Was in the area about a week ago and decided to get some Chinese at China A Go Go. Service was fast and they were really nice. We ordered 2 entrees, General Tso Chicken and Kung Poa Chicken with Fried Rice and Chow Mien sides. HOLY COW it was a lot of food!! Each plate was full, and MAN it was delicious! I really didn't want to stop eating it. It was so good, that we took the rest to go and ate it for dinner the night after! And it was STILL delicious! And had enough for me and my girlfriend both! The cost was not bad at all, especially for the amount of food that we got. Will definitely return the next time we are in the area!! And definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really yummy, good prices, and fast service. My fav dish is the eggplant tofu, it has a good spicy factor and an excellent sauce. The noodles aren't greasy or too soft. Delish!"}
{"text":"I've just tried the best war wonton soup! Perfect for this cold weather.  Tasty and generous portion."}
{"text":"I've gone to different locations and this location was bot great. I placed my order over the phone and the guy was distracted with talking to other people and laughing. When I walked in the staff were behind the counter and continued to talk to each other as we stood there waiting ti be greeted abd helped. After 2-3mins the lady finally looked over and assisted me. When getting home with our food we weren't impressed at all. The food was barley ok. The fried rice was bland and Mongolian beef was loaded with peppers and onions and barely any beef. 
Will not be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"Always spot on. Ive done dine in, delivery and pick up and they've always been superb. Even when it's a crazy busy night at dinner when Im calling for delivery oand their phone is ringing off the hook, they give me courtesy and professionalism as they take my order. The teriyaki chicken, Kung pao, bbq pork fried rice, whatever you get is delicious especially if you have special requests like no onions! They do great work, consistently! Love it! The staff rules too!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Service is good. My neice loves this place. I normally get the fried rice with chicken and shrimp and add pineapple. Bomb. My neice gets the beef and broccoli and teriyaki chicken which are both good. Good price"}
{"text":"We have ordered from China A Go Go twice. The first time it was very good. We had the Orange chicken, chow mien, sweet & sour chicken, and dumplings. A couple of nights ago we ordered again. Pretty much the same food but also got sesame beef. The food was okay. The meat is definitely not high quality, but overall the flavor is what you'd expect from a traditional Chinese restaurant. I'd give the food a 3. When we went to pick up the food my husband used the restroom and said it was filthy. No soap, no paper towels, dirty toilet, etc. I certainly hope the kitchen has soap & they're washing their hands before cooking. I'd give them a 1 for cleanliness."}
{"text":"I love China A Go Go!  It's the only place to go for Chinese food on this side of town.  Everyone there is amazing, the servers can take your order without having to write it down (and thats pretty awesome since my family usually orders 4-5 dishes).  They're very attentive also.  I never have to ask for anything like refilling my drink or bringing me boxes to take the food to go.  

The food is quite delicious! Everything comes out pretty fast.  Even if you're picking up food, it takes about 10 minutes for them to cook everything.  I love their A Go Go wings, which are salt and pepper wings that are super crispy with added chili peppers on top for a little kick.  You have to try it out sometime!  I also like getting HK crispy noodles, eggplant with tofu, and hunan beef.  

They also added some Thai food to their menu. The Thai Chicken salad that comes with a tasty peanut salad dressing.  Tom Yum soup is also really good if you're trying to clear your sinuses.  The Pad Thai is so so though.  If you're craving noodles, I'd say stick with chow mein."}
{"text":"I drove here for some dinner and doors were locked, around 8:30ish. Staff were inside and watch me try to get in. As I left their was another group of people who tried to go inside but the staff didnt acknowledge them either."}
{"text":"Was really craving Chinese take out. Spent about 45$ for me and my bf to get delivery and after Tio. Even though the guy tried to walk into my house. Hide yo wife hide yo children! First I want to say they charge and extra 2.50 for fried rice. Wth? Literally I'll throw some scramby egg and soy sauce and peas myself.  F it. The beef steak and pepper was mostly pepper and slimy steak. The orange chicken looked like embryos. Terrible. Only good this was my crag ragoon hence the one star. I was feeling a little stomach sick after. I have a sensitive stomach I won't hide that so I wasn't surprised when it happened. I was surprised however when my boyfriends stomach hurt Bc he has a typical man stomach of steal. Will never in a million years come back. Good luck."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Americanized Chinese food. The Sesame Chicken is bomb and the crab won tons are dericious!  I had my food delivered and I was shocked how fast it arrived, less than 30 minutes!  I'd recommend this place fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"This location has definitely fallen off though their deliver is always fast and persistent the quality of their food has dropped."}
{"text":"All due to LJ! I previously mentioned him but I got his name wrong. (sorry) LJ is fantastic at his job. When we visit he makes us feel so welcome and we consider him our friend! 
He has restored our faith in the service at this location and we love bringing him new customers because we are positive he will treat them well!"}
{"text":"Tastes like chinese food in most restauants. Egg drop soup had no flavor too."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down over the years. Not as good as it used to be. 8-1-15. I threw it in the garbage. Not going back.  Too bad"}
{"text":"We are from NJ and are always looking for food like home and this place nails it! It's a little pricey buy well worth it"}
{"text":"Their chicken pad Thai & vegetable pad Thai are so delicious! We get take our quite often from here and the food is always flavorful & delicious!"}
{"text":"great amount of food for the price. The pot stickers were huge! Definitely going to eat from them again next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"My first impression was good but it has been in decline over the last few visits.  Some of their dishes are good but their chow mien noodles are very bland and the fortune cookies taste like card board.  These are two very basic Chinese restaurant items that should be very good.

I will say that the service is decent when you eat in and twice they've given us free egg rolls and a Chinese donut.  I appreciate it but it doesn't sway my opinion from a 2 star.

Maybe China A Go Go is Americanized Chinese food. I lived in Asia (Singapore) for a year and traveled around SE Asia so my taste buds might have become snobbish.  LOL"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from this place 7:30 pm. Ordered the curry chicken  , amd it is terribly bland. , no flavor just onions and chicken,  super dry! Couldn't even eat it .  I give it 2 stars for 20 minute delivery  and for the really good thai ice tea ."}
{"text":"Whenever we feel like having Chinese food, this is the place we order from.  Place is clean, food is good and delivery time is quick.  The employees are very friendly.  We love their combination fried rice which consist of shrimp, chicken and beef.  Our second favorite is the honey walnut shrimp.  Slightly fried shrimp in a creamy sauce with candied walnut.  I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings and was not really pleased with the taste.  It didn't taste like the ones I've had in San Diego.  (That's for a different review). Lol.  Overall, if you're in the Aliante area and crave Chinese food, go check them out."}
{"text":"This place is Lowkey underrated. I have went to this place about three times & so far they have never disappointed. I get the chicken fried rice & the sesame chicken! I love it so far. This place can get a bit pricey so watch what you get.  Also, inside can get a tad bit crowded be careful what time you come. Big portions however, it may seem small in the box, but it's a lot of food in there. Overall good place"}
{"text":"Great staff and quick service. The kung pao chicken was delicious. Will definitely be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Good prices, Good service, try the wor wonton soup, big portion huge bowl, and cheap too. The Crab rangoons are top-notch also."}
{"text":"Horrible, please don't confuse this place with the other locations. China a go go on rainbow is terrific, durango is great too. This place serves their dine in guest with plastic forks and styrofoam bowls, the wor wonton soup here is gross and takes on the taste of plastic its served in. Sliced pork is over sauced and orange chickens really bad last place on earth id eat at....go to a different china a go go please..."}
{"text":"If you have been to the Cheyenne and 215 area, you know this is literally a food desert. Walmart in the same parking lot does NOT count. With that said, I was ecstatic when this location opened. 

On my first visit, I had the Sauteed Vegetables and a Strawberry Slush with boba. I skipped the rice and all of the vegetables were easily identifiable (broccoli, snow pea pods, onions, bok choy, and mushrooms). The vegetables were cooked perfectly and I was full with just the lunch portion and no rice. The Strawberry Slush was the perfect ending to my meal. Not too sweet, with a smooth texture and plenty of boba.

On my second visit, I got the Vegetable Pad Thai and a Thai tea with boba. I will be honest and say it is not as good as you would find at a Thai restaurant, but good enough for the location. The noodles were cooked well and the vegetables and egg were seasoned well. The best part was the Thai tea with boba. I think I enjoyed that more than my Pad Thai. It was perfectly sweet and satisfied my sweet tooth. 

On my third visit, I had Vegetable Lo Mein and surprisingly, I really enjoyed it. Like the sauteed vegetable plate, all of the vegetables were cooked well (broccoli, snow pea pods, onions, green onions, and mushrooms). This time I also tried the Taro slush with boba and I was not disappointed. 

Definitely a good place to visit and the employees were very friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying food here but it's still not good for me. I ordered house special chicken and it's coated with thick flour. It's no different with orange chicken. So what's special about it? NONE. Don't waste your money, same thing with their chowmein, it's effin bland.  I bet you, all their menu here it's either super sweet, super saltly or sour. Coz they want their over coated meat with flour to be \"tasty \""}
{"text":"Best Place for Chinese Food! I've ordered Chinese from this guys for years on the Henderson Location when I live on that side of town...
Thank-goodness I found one in SW area Love it as much as the Henderson Location. You guys are the best! China A GO GO"}
{"text":"Chicken egg foo young and chicken chow mein were okay. The disaster was with the sweet and sour chicken that had no chicken in it.....majority was fried batter."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS and their entire staff is incredibly rude and has attitude. They shouldn't be in service industry"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!! I've yet to get a bad entree. This time we tried the combination fried rice, yummm!! It had loads of shrimp, pork and chicken. We always get the Mongolian beef, hot garlic shrimp, teriyaki chicken bowl and sweet and sour pork, then add a couple more that suit our fancy if the day. 

I'd give it 5 star, but a couple things drop it a notch. I always get take out, and they never put chopsticks in the bag. If I forget to ask, no chopsticks. I get if they are wanting to save a buck on giving them to people that don't use them, but ask at pick up if you'd like chopsticks! 

Also, the sitting area is a bit dingy. I know there is a lot of frying and cooking going in in there, but a good degreaser once a month in the lobby would be an asset!! 

So, I highly recommend take out from this place!! You won't be disappointed! Oh, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"The food was great they give more portions than other China ago ago's I have been too. Price was really cheap as well."}
{"text":"I use to order delivery from the China A Go Go on the Windmill location all the time. I loved it. I also ordered catering from that place whenever I have office parties. Everything there was friendly, portions generous, and food great. This location? No so much. Rude, stand off-ish, and the portions are a lot smaller. Ordered from them three times. The restaurant got mad at me when I accidentally made the delivery person wait 5 minutes for me to get home. And the third time when I called for delivery, they try to say there's a minimum amount I have to order in order for them to deliver when there was never such a thing at the other location and wasn't such policy the first two times I ordered. Horrible. Too bad because I tip 20% literally all the time because I work in the service industry too."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery every time. Reasonably priced and every time we order they offer us a side of egg rolls or crab rangoons for free. One of the only Chinese restaurants my husband will order from."}
{"text":"Ordered Kung pao chicken, potstickers, crab ragoons, chicken chow mein, salt and peppered shrimp. All the dishes lacked flavor. The last time I went the Kung pao was good but the Mongolian not So much. This Was the worst Chinese food I ever ordered. I have ordered there previously and it was decent that's why decided to order delivery. I will never order from there again.  So disappointed"}
{"text":"Had a craving for good Chinese food, so I decided to drive across town to give this place a try. Unfortunately it was the most disappointing, lack luster excuse for chinese food that I've ever had in my life. I ordered the orange chicken lunch special with chow mein. The orange chicken was mediocre at best, and the chow mein was shameful. I've never seen chow mein with no vegetables and no flavor. These were plain, bland noodles. Most likely won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Nothing really bad to say about this place. Its Chinese food, and they deliver. Pricing is fair."}
{"text":"The WORST service EVER! Muriel was our server and was absolutely the rudest person I've ever had waiting on me. I will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, they have some great lunch specials until 4pm.  I have tried several different items here and they have always delivered well.

The staff are nice, they try and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need.

If you are in the area and like Chinese stop in for some food, you should be happy."}
{"text":"It was a great experience! Food was delicious and came hot! We waited a little over an hour for delivery so I went with 4 stars but it totally hit the spot for my Chinese food craving!

Fried rice was amazing, orange chicken was great and my husband enjoyed his beef and broccoli and hot and sour soup. We will probably skip the chow mein next time, though."}
{"text":"I'm sure there is better Chinese food in town but this is my local and one of my favorite spots!
Hands down... I'm always in for the lunch specials.  Lunch will cost me 6 dollars and I'll have some to take home later, so I get two meals for 6 dollars.  I always order the orange chicken.  
Sitting down for lunch will get you some soup and fried wong ton, free of charge.
The place has some of the best customer service that I know of, they are always smiling and pretty quick.  Some days are busy, which might make them take a while but never less, still a fan and enjoy my lunch there almost weekly!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, usually give out some free wonton chips if you eat in. The mapo tofu is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine as well as the honey walnut shrimp. They are very accommodating and quick and are very consistent in quality. I wouldn't say this is the best Chinese food but way better than most chains"}
{"text":"The place is pretty small but clean. I like their lomein noodles.also ordered the orange chicken and crab Rangoon, it was pretty good also but lomein was my favorite. I believe they also have delivery."}
{"text":"Good for a take out place. I think the pot stickers were hand made. Hot and Sour soup was not so good.  Salt and Pepper Shrimp was good.  Plenty of food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Never tried China A Go Go before, but my roommate likes to go here so the boyfriend and I decided to order in. We ordered their six count pot sticker appetizer ($5.95), Honey Walnut Shrimp ($11.95), Chicken Teriyaki ($8.95) and Orange Chicken ($8.95).
   
The food was very... meh. Both chicken entrees were dry and the Chicken Teriyaki was swimming in watered down sauce. The pot stickers were okay, big but not a lot of taste. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was just okay too, it to didn't have a lot of taste and it was more breading than shrimp. 

On a more positive note, this restaurant actually gave us utensils for our food for delivery and for the prices and portions are very large. We won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"great food and service. love this place! close to home so we can walk over anytime. prices are good and nice big portions."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up... I asked for wonton soup, steamed rice, and fried rice. The cashier repeated the order to me correctly. When the food was picked up, they didn't even have the name on the order correct. I come to find out that there was no steamed rice with my order."}
{"text":"Basic chinese food. 
Wasn't very impressive and not as good as other China a go go locations.
I usaualy try a place twice before I make a final review. Stay tuned"}
{"text":"I love this place! There's hardly anything to eat around here, so this is a real standout for sure. Everything we've eaten here is full of flavor, comes in large portions, and is prepared very quickly. They're also very friendly whenever I pick up take out. I crave their Mongolian beef dish all the time, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Their Mongolian 
beef is my favorite. They give a very generous serving size for their lunch specials. Definitely will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this China a Go Go to open for quite some time. There was just something about the beef with broccoli I had tried from another location of theirs. It was so flavorful.

I drove by for lunch today and was happy to see the grand opening sign. I'm not sure if they have any actual grand opening specials, but I didn't care. I wanted to verify if my previous beef with broccoli experience was just a fluke or if it was for real. As expected, the dish is one of the lunch special choices available for $5.95.

I still don't know what it is about that beef with broccoli, but it was indeed damn flavorful! Next time, I have to make sure to get all rice instead of half rice and half chow mein. I need as much rice as possible in order to soak up all that delicious sauce. I may even need to get white rice instead of fried.

Will I return? How about this for an old quote... \"You betcha!\""}
{"text":"One star for conceive and well cooked veggies. :\ for the chicken teriyaki bowl. Hardly any sauce, but the worst was the chicken! It is the lowest quality they can get and sell. :( so sad! Bc it was my lunch.. Can't leave work again. Threw this bowl away! Guess that's what u get for $5.68! China a NO NO!! Never again will I return! Same with my fo workers who ordered the wonton soup! The shrimp was cut up! No cabbage or other wonton soup norms!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service! We ordered Wonton soup, Hot and Garlic Chicken, and Mongolian Beef. I love them all! They deliver too!"}
{"text":"Theyre AWFUL...save yourself and visit any of the other locations.....THIS CHINA A GO GO IS TERRIBLE. Im always met with attitude and unplesantness all around. I wouldnr recommend them if I were.in Smiths parking lot famished."}
{"text":"Hubby and I happened across this place while I was 7 months pregnant and seriously craving some good Chinese eats. We didn't want to go far from our new house, and we found a coupon on our doorstep a few days earlier for free egg rolls with a $10 order, so we thought we'd give China A Go Go a try. Thank heaven for pregnancy cravings!! This is our new go-to Chinese place. Everything is hot fresh and tasty. 

The Hot Garlic chicken is my favorite, and they even substituted vegi chowmein for one of our white rices. Nice!! The Chicken Mu Shu is super yumm, and their prices are on point. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"So delicious! The food is great and the boba tea, yum! ... What I also like about this place is that it's super clean! My husband and I go once a week for lunch. Lots of food for awesome price! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese take out. Fast and fresh and always good. The Taiwanese mei fun noodles are the best."}
{"text":"I have never been crazy about China A Go Go. From my perspective it is a level above Panda Express and fast food restaurants in general. However, it is a level below many casual dining Chinese restaurants. The majority of the time that I dine in China A Go Go is during their lunch special. China A Go Go is a 3.5 star Chinese restaurant that I never went out of my way to dine in. The usual scenario will be that I am in the immediate area and making a spontaneous choice between a few fast food restaurants to patronize.  Most of the time the fast food competitors are a no-go for value and I will hit up China A Go Go for lunch. This is what occured last Sunday.

  I was visiting my brother up in North Las Vegas. We decided to visit Aliante Nature Discovery Park and the Aliante trail system. The Smith's Shopping Center parking lot was the trailhead. If you haven't been to this shopping center, it includes Arby's, KFC, Subway, and other eateries. China A Go Go was the winning choice.

  China A Go Go is just as familiar to me as Panda Express. China A Go Go is a go-to spot for decent Chinese food in the Las Vegas valley. The upshot is their locations are sprouting up across the Las Vegas Valley. Not every location is identical. At some locations you order the food at the counter and pour your own Coke beverage. But at this location, the friendly waitress greeted my brother and yours truly. She seated us and served our food. When the styrophone cup of Coke was low, she refilled it. She was friendly and made my brother and I feel welcome. Too bad I can't say that about an element of the higher priced restaurants I visited.

  Ordering at China A Go Go is as easy as 1-2-3.  You don't even have to walk inside to glance at their menu. It is outside on the window. The luncheon menu ranges from $5.95 to $6.50 for shrimp-based entrees. 

  I ordered the shrimp chop suey luncheon special. It included soup of the day, fried rice, and chow mien noodles. The soup of the day was the exact soup China A Go Go has been serving me for the last six years: egg drop soup. Don't get me wrong. Egg drop soup is good. But it is nothing like wonton soup. Three stars. I enjoyed the shrimp chop suey. China A Go Go was generous with the portions of shrimp. And tasty shrimp I might add. Three-and-a-half stars. The fried rice was tasty filler food. I appreciated that around 30% and not 50% of the plate (a styraphone bowl by the way) was taken up by chow mien noodles. There have been a handful of Chinese restaurants that have left me with a sour taste of the place on account of too much of the plate being taken over by filler chow mien noodles.

  When all is said and written, I could return to the Aliante Parkway China A Go Go when I am in the immediate area during lunch. A 3.5 star Chinese restaurant is always a candidate for a future check-in."}
{"text":"Faster than you can say \"a go go,\" China A Go Go will have your food on your table. Maybe I am exaggerating. However, based on my two recent experiences dining in a China Go Go, my food was delivered to my table at a remarkably fast rate. So fast that I now regard China A Go Go in the fast food Chinese food category where the Panda has dominated. 

   It was a sunny Sunday afternoon, and I was living the dream hiking on the windy and rolling pathways of the Seven Hills trail system. By the time I returned to my car I had built up an appetite for Chinese food. I cruised along the sinuous and hilly drives of Seven Hills to the Von's anchored shopping center off Eastern and Reunion. This is where Eastern Avenue changes from a linear city of shopping centers into a residential thoroughfare overlooking the Las Vegas valley. This China A Go Go is a familiar storefront. It has been here for years way back when the bakery was an It's A Grind. 

   The first thing that is striking when stepping inside this location is its tiny footprint. In comparison it is far smaller than the majority of the China Go Go's. Regardless there are a few tables. 

   I had made the daily lunch special when delicious Chinese food is in the same price level as fast food restaurants. Then again I regard China A Go Go as fast food. I handed over $9.32 for the shrimp Chop Suey lunch special with a fountain drink. This included fried rice, soft chow mein noodles, and soup of the day. Prior to February 6, 2011 on the day my Yelp profile was born, the soup of the day has been egg drop soup. 

   The egg drop soup served in a styrofoam bowl was decent. When the soup arrived on my table, I decided to take in the soup before checking in on Yelp. But it seemed that faster than I can say  \"a go-go\" my lunch arrived on the table. I appreciate speed of service at the exact time that my mind is questioning why is this food served so fast? In all honesty I don't want to know. The styrofoam box of Chinese food was good. But not GREAT like New York Chinese Restaurant to the east and China Tango Bistro to the south. I felt that there was a sufficient amount of shrimp to compliment the vegetables. The fried rice was likewise good as the filler soft chow mein noodles was. 

    In conclusion, China A Go Go is a China A So So in my book. When I am in the Seven Hills area, I will most likely concede future China A Go Go check-ins to New York Chinese Restaurant and other restaurants. Faster than I can say \"A Go go,\" I say \"3 stars.\""}
{"text":"Wow! China Go Go does not splurge on their portions. I felt like I ate half a family dinner. Not a lunch special (served to 4 PM.).
  China Go Go features two price ranges for lunch specials. $5.95 and $6.25 for shrimp based entries. Personally, I prefer the pepper steak, shrimp chop suey, and shrimp with lobster sauce.
  This is the typical China Go Go experience. Upon ordering from the menu, you pay. If you are drinking a cola, you pick up a cup and serve your self at the cola fountain. The server will deliver your food and plastic utensils. If you are happy with your service, there is a tip jar at the counter.
  The lunch special started with noodles and duck sauce. I enjoy thick noodles.
  Then, they served me the soup of the day: egg drop soup. This has been the soup of the day at China Go Go everyday for the last three years. My taste buds would enjoy something different, such as won ton or hot and sour soup.
  Finally, they served my entree: shrimp chop suey with fried rice and chow mien. The portion could feed two people. The shrimps were giant. No scrimping on quality here. With all the broccoli and mushrooms, I felt like I was eating healthy, instead of pigging out. The fried rice was your average fried rice. I am not crazy over the chow mien. It's like filler on what would be a great album. In all honesty, I prefer Panda Express's Chow Mien.
  As I said, China Go Go gives a lot for a lunch special. However, large portions do not guarantee a five star review. I would be a fan if they change their soup of the day or add won ton soup at a reasonable charge, and improve their chow mien, which is served with the meal. I give China Go Go 3 1/2 stars, which is good.
 Return factor: high. I appreciated the customer service. If the customer service is great on my next visit, I'll most likely become a fan and up my rating to 4 stars on an updated review."}
{"text":"China Go Go serves a good lunch special up to 4 PM. Many times when I work an earlier shift, and could make it to China Go Go by 4 PM., I take advantage of the special. 
  There is a variety of entrees. Unfortunately not chow mien or lo mien. Included is the soup of the day-usually Egg Drop, noodles, and fried rice. My favorite is shrimp chop suey. Their shrimp is tasty. Just like Panda Express a shrimp entree is slightly more money. With a beverage, I pay a little over $7 for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Food from here is always fresh and tastes great. Just got food delivered and it's exactly what I ordered. This place does not disappoint . Very friendly staff, great place to eat in or get delivery. Love their food!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken taste like pure bleach yuck. Don't plan on eating here again!!! Pretty sure the health district needs to come here"}
{"text":"Food is average, service average. We've dined in and carry out. We had the food delivered this time. Let's just say the delivery guy was extremely pushy regarding the tip!!! We paid with a credit card and normally your able to leave a tip when you sign the receipt. Apparently with this place your not. So when I open the door the first word isn't hello or a simple hi. It's you didn't leave me a tip, are you giving me cash. 

WTF, are you serious! I looked at him and I said hi, he just looked at me and stood there. I then asked him for my food and it was like he was holding my food hostage Intel he got his tip. I was so annoyed ( let me add they charged me $2 for delivery). I always tip, but this gentleman has no sense  of customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is alright the breading is on the softer fluffier side.. really not a fan of... but the soup and egg rolls were good."}
{"text":"Waitresses here are not friendly. U come in, they dont even smile. They dont make u feel welcomed.... Thats why we always order for to go instead of staying there and deal with their attitudes. The guy waiter is the only friendly person ive encountered there when we dined in there once. I wish i knew his name. Food is okay. Pepper steak with fried rice and chowmein is our usual. And for sushi, i love their lisa lisa roll. Their hawaiian bbq? Hmmm id rather order mine from aloha kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everyone there is super friendly! We live not too far and sometimes order delivery. They quote you 45 minutes for delivery but always show up im about 20. My order is never wrong and food is always hot! Great place thats near by!"}
{"text":"Had beef and broccoli takeout here the other day. Became violently ill! Horrible horrible food poisoning. I've eaten here before but one strike and you're out when it comes to food poisoning. When you eat here you put your health at risk. Avoid or be sorry like I am."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting they should be shame of sellinh sweet n sout shrimo ad a kids meal the size of my foot they arr nasty an attitude stinks! No Customer service values"}
{"text":"Good food I like the Fried rice and the chicken wings are very tasty. I recommend going here."}
{"text":"We love eating in or getting it delivered. Huge helpings and they always add a little extra to our order...love their Thai Tea!!! Great for a good sized meal at a reasonable cost when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience...been a loyal customer for 13 years. Have tried other places like this and always end up back here. The quality of the food and service is a great value. The staff makes you feel welcome...my son feels so comfortable here makes it an easy choice for lunch after Church"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here I've been coming here for the last 5 years and get different menu items. All has been good except the chow mein (i guess i'm just not a fan of that). My husband does not like chinese food but will only go to this location if I ask for Chinese. Only place he has not complained of the food."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are great. Kunp pao combimation is always good. I think they evem have free delivery"}
{"text":"I walked in after a long day at work around 9 o'clock thinking they close at 10:30 they sat me down and I ordered got good food and left around 9:30. Little did I know that they closed at 9:30 it was kind of them to not throw it in my face that they were closing."}
{"text":"I call this place China Lady GoGo. 

I called off work the other day (because I was over that shit, yo) and I decided I was not going to leave the house on my day off.  As I was watching the Price is Right (I miss being unemployed!), I caught the Hunger Bug. 

This place is right down the street, so I called them up and ordered the sweet and/or sour chicken, which came with an egg roll and fried rice. The lunch menu on the weekdays is cheap!

The driver showed up minutes after I got off the phone with a bag chalk-full of steaming Chinese deliciousness. 

The chicken dish comes with the red sauce on the side so the chicken was allowed to be crispy when it arrived. The egg roll and rice went well with watching Ellen. 

I resolved that I had to take off more work in the future to get that weekday lunch special. Even though I got fired, it was worth it."}
{"text":"The worst food I've had!! Employees are rude and food is flavorless! The veggies taste old and the pork taste like left overs... orange chicken was ok, but other than that I would never go back. My 1 star is for the orange chicken."}
{"text":"So glad I tried this place . I live across the street and so convenient and sooo good ! Everything I have ordered has been excellent and such huge amount"}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of places for carry-out Chinese food and this place has the best food at good prices. Can't complain! Get the won ton soup and beef fried rice."}
{"text":"Better than Panda Express. Food is made fresh by order and it tastes fresh too. The menu is large and extensive. My favorite thing is their lunch menu since it serves 1, but in reality it will feed 2 people, i jut wish they offered that lunch menu all day.

My favorite dish of theirs is the shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, chow mein,  egg drop soup, and the broccoli and beef. The restaurant itself is small, maybe about 8 tables, so it's really better if you order ahead and take it home. It's right next to the subway in the Smith's shopping center so there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Everything was great!  Nice prices, nice portions. Delish sesame beef and orange chicken. Next time i will order extra orange sauce to keep it saucy and not too dry. Sweet and sour sauce is on point!! Delivery came quick and there cream cheese wontons are like heaven! Thank you china a go go, we love you!!"}
{"text":"China a go go will fix that Chinese food craving, but is it the best, no, def not the worst either.  My biggest problem is that the prices don't match the food.  Maybe if prices were a tad lower and the egg drop soup were better..."}
{"text":"this is the first time I've eaten in, i will not be ordering delivery again if i can help it.

their lunch specialv is huge. I've only eaten the soup and won tons....already full.

If you like boba don't come right at opening, its not ready yet. that's the reason for 4 stars.

the combination kung pao is too spicy for me...the spiciest i've ever had. they put the regular crushed red pepper and the long red peppers, but also add jalapeno. next time i will order no jalapeno .

the lunch with large Thai tea was under 10 bux and more than enough for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"For no-frills Chinese, I loved it. The food was excellent! Dining in? Meh...paper plates, plastic utensils, but regardless the food is great and there's plenty of it! The Pot Stickers were huge and I got 6 of them, that filled me up alone and they were good. The chicken Fried rice, and General Tsao chicken was fantastic. Even though I ate there, they served all my food in to go containers, so now I have dinner or lunch for several days left over.

Ambiance=0
Service=8
Food=9

It's my take out place from now on."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place! So far, I like the sesame beef. Its really good and sweet. Will definitely recommend my friends to come check out this place. :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be good I order once A month,while at work.    and this place messed up my whole meal and charged me extra and forgot my drink. on top of waiting for over 1 hour I will never order China a go go again"}
{"text":"Yay for boba tea because they have it here now and that makes me happy! China A Go Go is always a great go to place for lunch or dinner. It's way better than Panda Express and they have great lunch specials too! My family loves the Orange Chicken here because it isn't dry and over done like at Panda. I am a fan of the fried rice and veggies myself. Of course you can never go wrong with the chips that they give you here while you are waiting, they are super addicting and they are great to dip in anything! 
They are always super friendly here too, which is always a plus because you can't just have yummy food if you don't have nice friendly people to go with it :-)"}
{"text":"Sucks to ive them only 3 stars,but things have gone down hill. It was my fav place for many years as they had similiar food to that if what i was use to,NY chineese food. In the past 6 months the quality has gone downhill. Their food  has become salty and lacking in the flavor it once had . Maybe the owners changed hands or maybe the cook changed.  I hope it improves"}
{"text":"OMG!  This is the place I go to for Chinese when I visit my family in Vegas. This place is so damn good my mouth waters while writing this.  
Like I've said before I always judge a Chinese food restaurant based off there Beef Lo Mien, (or Chow Mien, depending on what part of the country you're from)  Which is a soft long fat round noodle, with no vegetables and extra spicy, and cream cheese wantons.
For Chinese there customer service is top notch, it's cheap, and there establishments always seem very clean.  This particular location I come to because it's close to my parents house.  They also have fountain soda which is kinda important to me. I hate places that charge by the can, and a lot of Chinese places charge by the can.  That's kind of an immediate turn off.  This place is great!
You gotta try them out!"}
{"text":"Beef hunan amazing but broc beef had zero flavor.  Veggies had no flavor either when menu said should have garlic flavor.  Fried rice very good, altho menu prices online are lower than actual prices, thus charged more first time ordering to go.  Very fast and easy to call ahead and order."}
{"text":"On my way to go eat at Hot Head Burritos, turns out they are now closed. Super hungry and find myself settling for a place called China A GO GO which should be called China a NO NO. 

Ordered orange chicken lunch special and it comes with rice and chow mein noodles. The chicken is frozen and taste like frost bite. Needless to say I will pray I don't get sick. 

Recommend Subway next door. 

Chow mein was good though."}
{"text":"love their chow mein and orange chicken. flavorful and the wait is never long. This is our go to Chinese food place in our area. We have tried others and they are terrible. So now we stick with the china a go go."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food on this side of town. Their egg foo young is always cooked perfectly and the gravy for it is just right. We usually get their seafood combination and it comes with shrimp, lobster and an assortment of vegetables. Their fried rice is not greasy at all. You get free egg rolls with your meal."}
{"text":"Food is O.K., nothing special. Takeout service was fast. Prices reasonable. The vegetable soup was delicious, and I doctored it up w the rest of the veggie lo mein, Sirracha, and lime. I have had much better Chinese, but this place is fine on the fly."}
{"text":"We get takeout from here maybe once a month or two. Everything we get is good. I really like the Hot and Sour Soup (NO SEAFOOD!) I like that they have eggplant and tofu all the time. Kung Pao chicken is good and sometimes we get Spring Rolls. Also, we always get those great little fried noodles that you have to eat with the plum sauce while they're still warm. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food was a little dry and too salty the HK noodle wasn't what I'm used to. Orange chicken and beef broccoli was good. Just wish delivery didn't take that long almost a hour."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special of the salt n spicy shrimp, which was delicious, and instead of getting the fried rice I requested white, but I didnt get the chow mein noodles; thoughtvthat was part of the lunch spec - 1 entree rice and chow mein noodles.  I did order egg rolls, maybe because I ordered white rice no noodles? Thought about asking but was getting full..."}
{"text":"Friendly people and fresh food but is it me or does all Chinese food taste the same no matter if it is a mom and pops original restaurant?! Nevertheless, I love the ribs and chicken wings."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special hot garlic chicken, and to be completely honest I chose the dish because if the Szechuan sauce. Rick and morty's season 3 premier made me realize that it was sorely lacking from my life and I wanted to try it. Holy wow the dish was amazing. The mushrooms were meaty and perfect and the chicken was juicy. I asked for extra sauce on the side and it was the prettiest sauce I've seen with the peppers served in a large portion. I got a lot of food for 7$ the lunch specials have the dish + a huge portion of rice + noodles. I am so full. I also order crab Rangoons and they're fried perfectly (dip em in the Szechuan sauce). Overall I am deeply satisfied. The food got here really quick and it was still piping hot while I ate it. Good job guys."}
{"text":"This place was on dirty dining 2 much don't know if I can trust it my whole family used 2 go there since dirty dining none of us go there"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant and I was really happy with the service & the food is great!  We got the Lunch specials and it was generous helpings and more than we could eat.  Had to get a box to take home the leftovers.  They were always checking to see if we needed anything or drink refills.  I would recommend this place to everyone!  Great place to eat.  
I came to Yelp to find a place to get Chinese food.  Thanks for all the reviews!  Place was great!!  Wish I knew how to post a photo.  Pics even look delicious!!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, incredible food, I come here all the time and am never disappointed. I would definitely recommend you try it out"}
{"text":"Boba tea here is really good and their plates are always big and delicious,  when I need my Asian food fix this is the 1rst place that pops into my mind :) thr best!"}
{"text":"Food portions are big even for the lunch special. Service is great too with no complaints, sometimes they give you free sugar donuts on the house! I like General Tso's chicken with a little spice."}
{"text":"Really GOOD Chinese food is so hard to find, even if you go to Chinatown, so being that this place was on Windmill in a strip mall, I was quite skeptical.  However, I had a horrible Chinese food craving after a weekend of too much alcohol and needed some grease to balance me out.  Since this is just down the street from my house, I decided to give a try and get delivery.

First off, you can place your order right online. It's really convenient and easy.  Everyone knows how hard it is to order Chinese food on the phone sometimes because you can't understand each other!  I ordered pot-stickers $5.95, pork fried rice $5.95 and combination kung pao chicken $8.95.  The prices were SO REASONABLE!  My order was $24 with tax and delivery fee.  But I noticed that they have these family meal combos where you get soup, an appetizer, fried rice, white rice and 1 or 2 entrees for a set price that was under $25, or a personal combo package for $9.95.  

The delivery took about 40 min, which is typical.  The best part is that the food is FREAKIN' AMAZE balls!  It's some of the best Chinese I've had in Vegas.  The ONLY thing that made me give this 4 stars were the pot stickers.  They were huge and the insides were yummy, but they were slightly undercooked so that the top part dough tasted not completely done.  If they had just been cooked more evenly, these would have been amazing.  As they were, I had to pick off all the dough and just eat the outside and the bottoms.  

I'm excited that this place is so close by.  I will ALWAYS go here when I want some yummy Chinese."}
{"text":"I have a lot of food allergies! I'm picky! I've been oredering from China a go go for many years! They know my allergies and essentially create dishes for me. I've never had a problem! It's always hot, fast and allerg in free!"}
{"text":"Great grub , always tastes good and big meat portions - and very fast delivery time
Family meal b with the won ton soup, kung pao chicken and Mongolian shrimp is the way we go. Keep up the great food and service"}
{"text":"If you are in Henderson and don't want to drive 10 miles to Chinatown area, then check out China A Go Go.  It is pretty darn good and about 10 levels higher in quality than Panda.

1.  Ambiance - Located in a strip mall with easy parking and fighting for your food attention with a coffee shop and a sandwich shop near by.  You can smell the Chinese cooking and it get's your olfactory senses going.....  Inside, the restaurant is small, a few tables and quite crowded if there are people waiting in line.

2.  Food - The quality of food here is quite good.

a.  Beef Chow Fun (Dry) - One of my favorite foods or comfort foods as my grandmother and mom always made this for me growing up.  I like the fact that this dish not only has al dente noodles, they do not fill up the dish with carrots and celery.  Veggies are important to the texture and the taste of the overall dish, yet using carrots and celery actually takes away from the taste of the dish vs. adding to the flavor.  Here they use green onion, onion, bean sprouts.  Very nice.

b.  Chicken Curry - The flavor of the curry is a bit spicy, not too hot, just enough to get your juices kicking.  You won't need to grab lots or water, so rather it is a nice taste and flavor.  It is unfortunate that due to mostly western palate, that they use chicken breast instead of chicken on the bone.  The flavor of chicken on the bone is far superior to chicken breast.  However, they do slice the breast just right and flash cook it at the right speed so it is quite tender and juicy.

c.  Spring Bean with Chicken - Love the flavor of the black bean mixed with this dish.  The spring beans are cooked to perfection and the chicken is flavorful and tender.

d. Rice - They give you plenty of rice with your dishes.

e.  Overall - All the food here is focused on western taste, yet all the cooks are Chinese short order cooks or so appear to be and yapping away in Chinese.  The cooks are all visible as you enter, so you can see everything.   They do catering here and pan sized dishes, so this is great for parties.  I don't vary much on what I order from here, because the menu is mostly western food, and not what I normally order.  However, for what I do order, it is great.

I say check it out. You cannot go wrong.  This place is like going to Inn and Out for a burger vs. McDonalds."}
{"text":"Authentic. 

Coming from San Francisco and living with home made Chinese food, I can tell you, when I am ready to have a great quick REAL Chinese meal, this is the place I go, instead of driving to Las Vegas.

Real chinese cooks, real ingredients that take time to prepare. None of the normal celery, carrots, onion and green onion only ingredients. Yes, this place is made for the palate of suburbanites in Henderson, but you can find some great stuff like Chicken Curry, Chow Fun Noodles, and String Bean Beef.  All very tasty.  Best for take out or very casual dining, as the eat in area is very small and loud and crowded as you are basically in a take out environment.  Try it for basic and quick chinese food. Cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to try this after driving all day back from the grand canyon, that we didnt' get to see I might add.  I went with the orange chicken 0 (who can mess up orange chicken) well I found it.  My bf ordered something spicy garlic chicken. Blah. He gave me a bit  and i bit into something that must have had a rock in it. Not sure what it was but it gave me the worst toothache. We ordered the chow mein which was good, but we also ordered crab won tons and never got them. 15 min into eating we finally went to ask and they gave it to us and as ana pology gave us 2 stale cold egg rolls. yuck. where you can taste the grease as you bite it. whats worse than cold grease?  I recommend trying pick up stix!!! they've never done me wrong!"}
{"text":"Let me start by apologizing for not posting sooner. 2 months ago....I am still trying to forget the horrible nightmare I experienced here. I was so hungry, long busy day at work, I decide to break for lunch, treat myself...normally I bring lunch from home.  I decide on my old favorite China go go.  I rush back to my office and start scarfing down my Kung Pao lunch combo.  The noodles were nasty, so I move on to my entree, after two bites I see the antenea of dead roasted  daddy ROACH!! I puke, gag, dry heave!!! I have a cucstomer walk in about an hour later, Im still shaking, I could cry I just ate kung roach pao!!! Worst experience ever!  Once I stop puking I call in and they offer to make me a new dish?!!!?? Really  NO THANKS!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a gift card I received during the holidays so I decided to try this place out during their lunch special. I got Broccoli Shrimp , Broccoli Chicken and Garlic Chicken lunch specials which come with a side  friedrice/chow mein. I also ordered Fried Wontons ( stuffed with chicken) and Combination Fried Rice both regular priced. Overall the food was decent but I found the chow mein to be very greasy and Broccoli Chicken was not very edible. I enjoyed the Garlic Chicken sauce but the actual chicken was cut in a weird way .The combo fried rice had chicken,pork and shrimp but the way it was packed the shrimp was stuck to the bottom of the container and I think maybe only had 1 shrimp? It wasn't as good as I had hoped. Overall I got a lot of food for around $36 but I wouldn't be quick to try it again. I have experienced better."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. My food didn't have much flavor. :(  the prices are low, they give you a TON of food and they even gave me extra food (delivery) they gave me free doughnuts. If it wasn't for how nice they were I would give them a 3 for the lack of flavor. But they are so considerate - they deserve a 4."}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese takeout joint around the area.  Our favorite dishes to order here are Shrimp Egg Foo Young and Combination Hong Kong Style noodles.  The Egg Foo Young patties with gravy is our favorite.  The fillings are inside and not outside the Egg patty like some restaurants.  The Hong Kong style noodles are not as good as restaurants in Chinatown and portions could be bigger but we like them.  If you don't want to drive all the way to Chinatown for takeout this is the place to order."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from China A GoGo for a while and I've never had issues with them or their food. I'm a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews but to each their own. The food is good but not luxurious 5 Star food. They always deliver promptly and the order is always right. Will continue to order from them."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in Vegas so far I would recommend to everyone! There pot stickers are to die for and I love the honey walnut shrimp I can eat it every day"}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered the dinner plate and it was so much food for only 9 dollars. Orange chicken was seriously amazing and delivery was fast."}
{"text":"I think what makes a restaurant great first and foremost -- is great quality food and second, excellent service. This restaurant offers both and more. My son and I are sick with the flu and we're so thankful we got our food promptly, and it was delivered by a very friendly delivery person. Highly 
recommend. Great delivery experience! My son loves their Vietnamese noodle soup."}
{"text":"Extremely nice servers. Came in and ordered a lunch special added on the house of extra samplers of appetizers which was free. I enjoyed their varieties of beverages especially there Boba drinks. We were always asked if everything was fine and great or how the food was? There courteous and respectful manner makes me want to come back and dine here again. I will definitely try the other menus when I return. Overall, I am and was a satisfied customer after dining here at China A Go-Go @ W. Cheyenne Ave. Continue to do what you guys do best! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick take out Chinese place near my apartment and this was definitely a winner. I ordered the egg rolls, chicken and broccoli and beef and broccoli. I ordered both chicken and beef so I could compare the two proteins and must say I find the beef to be tastier! The egg rolls were more like spring rolls to me..they are small with a delicate, flaky crust...not like the big NY egg rolls I am used to with a thick crust. 

  I liked how the rice is portioned in containers that are the same size as the entrees; there is nothing worse than getting a carton full of rice that is the size of my pinky. Also, they marked the rice cartons with a little black dash so I don't have to play a guessing game when I go to the refrigerator for left overs...which will happen...many times. The entrees are $9.55 each and are easily three portions! 

   The only downside was that the onions were a little too undercooked for my liking. I like my onions to be cooked until they are soft...not with a crunch and that pungent raw-onion taste."}
{"text":"This dining establishment has verify poor service. Server do not have any personality. No table service. We were required to order and pay at the register. So pay before being served. No drinks was offered. We had to get our own water."}
{"text":"My favorite place for delivery. They never take long and usually bring us freebies. My favorite is the honeydew slush."}
{"text":"Lately My Asian food of choice has been Thai, due to stronger flavoring in-general, but for a change of pace, I recently tried China A Go Go, & am extremely glad that I did!

I placed an electronic take-out order for 

Veggie Egg Foo Young, Veggie Fried Rice, and Salt & Pepper Tofu.   The estimated time for my order to be ready (on a Friday evening) was pretty fast, so when I got there right at the estimated time, I was pleasantly surprised that my order was indeed waiting for me!       Seems like they do a lot of take-out business, but I've never seen many people dining there.

While the Veggie Fried Rice was kind of plain, the other two dishes were full of flavor.  With the two pints of steamed rice they included, my $25 take-out order provided 3 full meals for me (& I eat a lot...).

I've already been back there, ordering the same dishes, minus the Fried Rice, and can easily envision ordering food from China A Go Go several times a month -- fast service, great food, & fair prices!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star because my last 2 orders have been completely wrong and they never remember my chopsticks."}
{"text":"They have such a friendly staff, I was never treated so nice in a fast food restaurant. Was ordering food for the in-law so I'm not sure how it tasted, but their service is definitely a five!"}
{"text":"All I can say is if you order the right way you will be very happy lol 

Pork fried rice extra dark, beef chow fun extra dark, veg egg foo young, honey walnut shrimp and sesame beef that's all you need in life don't order any off topic weird kind of stuff just stick with that and you will be very full and happy"}
{"text":"Yummy! Our new favorite fast food chinese place. I always order $1.00 extra meat on the lunch special, and it gives plenty of food for leftovers. Sesame chicken is the favorite in my house.  Service is friendly too. Plenty of tables to sit at if eating in."}
{"text":"I came here expecting to have a great meal with my daughter and we were both disappointed. Unfortunately it's the closest Chinese food place near my house"}
{"text":"A wonderful suprise discovery in my own backyard. Great Selection of entrees. Huge Portions. . Go with a friend or two and sample wache door in under 5mins.  others dining choices. Not to worry ..there will still be plenty to munch on as a late night snack. Or to go and they will have you out the door with your order in around 5 mins."}
{"text":"Great food and I couldn't believe how fast the delivery was. Time quoted was 45-60 mins, received it in under 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Have to say this place treats customers as if it's a five star restaurant. Extremely great service and extremely clean! I even got a free drink on the house. Can't believe this kind of service from a chain food business! A+"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!! 

I can't believe I found a delicious Chinese food delivery place!!! 

I got the half orders of Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, whole order of Pork Fried Rice, and Crab Rangoons. I of course was ordering for 2 people, and this was perfect, and even had leftovers. The Crab Rangoons could have used a little more crab... but everything else was just what you would expect. There was actually a substantial amount of pork, and orange chicken was crispy, and very flavorful.

The order came in about 35 minutes, and it was HOT, and Steamy, and just what you would want. YUM. If you order, you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think this place is BOMB.

Crab rangoons=amazing. Crispy on the outside with yummy cream cheese and crab on the inside. YUM

Not a fan of their chowmein but their fried rice and shrimp in lobster sauce was to delicious.

Really good chinese food. It has been hard to for me to find good chinese in vegas that didn't taste like Panda Express, finally found a good spot"}
{"text":"I have only had their lunch specials but they are huge and cheap. I personally like their Hot garlic and kung pao combination lunch specials. Both are very flavorful. I normally order it with all rice because the chow mein is too thick for me. I prefer thinner noodles. 

I do wish the lunch specials had an egg roll or crab rangoon included but I can't complain since they are so cheap."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service! Nobody ever came to offer a drink refill. It's like the servers don't want to be bothered. Not a good dinning experience."}
{"text":"This place is always empty and I was hesitant about ordering from here even though it's located at the corner of where I live.  So I decided to finally stop in on my way home from work and wow I was surprised.  They may seem empty but not today. I walked in and there were a few people already waiting for their order, they had several large phone orders and a few people were coming in after me.  

I ordered the pad thai and it was very very good.  I went back a few days later and ordered the lunch combination kung pao with fried rice.  and again there were a few people in front of me waiting for orders and a few people came in after me. 

I think this place just APPEARS to be quiet and empty but it really isn't.  The food is good, I will definitely go back and continue to try other things.  This isn't the BEST chinese food I've had but it's very good and worth return visits.  Their prices are avg and a good amnt of food for what you pay for."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss with the food here.  Their shrimp chow mein is pretty good not overly greasy.  Just tried their seafood delight and that was actually pretty good.  

Their Sesame Chicken now that my family loves and their Honey Walnut Shrimp.  

If you don't mind noise from the kitchen and the TVs and all the foot traffic this location gets (not many choices in S. Highlands) then eat in.  If not I suggest taking it to or having them deliver.  Their delivery is pretty fast!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, the food is yummy and the staff is nice.  Their Thai Tea is pretty amazing as well."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices. We do vegetarian options and get out for a family of four for around $30. They have a deal for takeout that will give you a free egg roll with sufficient purchase, but they don't tell you about it unless you know to ask. Dishes are indeed a bit too salty, but isn't all cheap Chinese food?"}
{"text":"If you want really quick and yummy Chinese, here is your place. 

We've ordered from here a few times now, and it's insane how fast they are. I placed an order last night, and they were at our door in 20 minutes. On average, they're always at our door within 45 minutes. Always faster than the estimated time. 

Best dishes:

The Mongolian Beef
Hunan Beef
Honey Shrimp

Also, for the price, they give you large containers. At least 1/4 to 1/3 larger than the surrounding Chinese joints. Always a plus!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often I always get one  the bowls, which last me a couple day. I recently tried the boba strawberry slush I and I am addicted! The staff isn't overly friendly. And I also like ordering from grubhub"}
{"text":"Price is right, food is authentic. Real Chinese people cooking Chinese food. Can't go wrong. Fried rice is the best."}
{"text":"Nice and close to the house
Tasty grub, at a great price.
For when you need a Chinese fix."}
{"text":"Blah, blah, blah....this food is boring and Panda Express has had tastier food which Panda Express is scraping the bottom of the barrel. My orange chicken was meh with no hint of spice or depth of flavor. The fried rice was rice, big hunks of scrambled eggs and a lot of peas. Totally flavorless and bland. The delivery took an hour and the food wasn't piping hot or even mediumly warm upon arrival. 

We received a couple of forks and some napkins, no soy sauce and no spicy mustard. I have never seen a Chinese delivery service not send soy sauce or at least one packet of spicy mustard. If I was to reorder, which I'm sure I won't you have to spell it out if you want any standard extra items. I will be on the look out for a better delivery Chinese place. This was bland, luke warm and totally tasteless. If the food had been hot the crab rangoons weren't bad, nor were the egg rolls. 

Typically with Chinese food I'll eat it over a couple of days but as soon as the table is cleared this food is going in the garbage. It doesn't even equate to good left overs. Steer clear of China a Go Go on Rainbow. It's a no go."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best won ton soup..and the employees are all awesome great customer service."}
{"text":"*WARNING* TAKE YOUR BUSINESS SOMEWHERE ELSE. Our food arrived at our house about 20 minutes ago, and we found 2, not 1 but 2 pieces of hair in our food!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good! Much much better than the China Max in outlet! We accidentally dropped in here because the Bachi burger is not open. Thought it might be similar to Panda Express, but the fried rice and Mapo tofu are surprisingly delicious! Yeah if u are Chinese, I highly recommend you try: MAPO TOFU and FRIED RICE."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Friendly staff. great food at reasonable prices. Large portions. customers always welcomed.   Mu shu pork, walnut shrimp.
etc. nice lunch and  dinner specials."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have some of the best Chinese food I have tasted here in Las Vegas. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas.  The servers are really friendly and they are willing to accommodate.  The sesame beef is amazing!  China a go go is a great option for dine in or takeaway."}
{"text":"Not bad not great. Decent takeout. The service was really good and it was clean inside."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once. I came in at lunch and ordered the Cashew Chicken. It came with fried rice and noodles. The prices was very good. The food was filling, and portion size was excellent, but the food was just ok to me.
Now, I know that they're are a lot of good reviews for this place, but just like every other cuisine you may try, individuals get a taste for how certain things are best tasting to themselves. My fried rice was rather bland from what I've come to expect from fried rice. The Cashew Chicken would've been really bomb, but they put a lot of ginger in the dish, and I just don't care for the overpowering taste of that root. The star of the meal was the noodles. Perfectly cooked and garlicky, they had the perfect balance, and I finished those before I was halfway done with the Chicken or the rice. 
It was nice and clean inside, the wait was short, and the people working there were very friendly. 
I would try another dish for lunch there sometime when I am back on that side of town working, and if so, my review may change a little. 
They are worth a shot, so give them a try!"}
{"text":"Ever since the sushi place next door opened, this place has gone downhill. Not only did they RAISE the prices, the quality of the food has decreased as well. My family used to love this place since it was the only decent asian place to eat on the east side... not anymore. And don't think the sushi place next door is any better because, IT IS NOT! 24$ for a half-a** AYCE dinner?! Do yourself a favor & save your money. I will for sure drive the extra miles to go to Sushi Twister or China town. 

The Fried Noodle (small appetizer): they gave our table of 8 people a tiny plate that was barley filled with fried noodles and the dipping sauce was noticeably watered down.

The Chicken Katsu: we basically were just eating fried panko batter, hardly any chicken.

The only thing that wasn't so bad was the spare ribs and the boba & even those prices weren't acceptably matchable to the quality. 

I would honestly say that this place is lucky there's no competition near by."}
{"text":"Delish!!!  With fast delivery!  My husband and I consistently fight for the carton with Mongolian  .

{"text":"The food here is probably the best Chinese I've ever had. I mean the service isn't top notch but I take it home anyway. You get a lot of food for your money! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal! Fast, friendly service. Gfood is great! We've been coming here for 6 years! Thanks for keeping it great each time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible restaurant!!!!

Magically, after paying, they no longer have the individual meal so my husband is not getting the crab ragoon, soup and egg roll with my 3 individual dinners that was ordered.

Didn't get the fried rice for one of the dinners

They told my husband 48.08 and charged my card 58.67!!!!!!!!

When I called, they were rude and acted like I was the issue. While I was dealing with them, I found hair fried/stuck to my sweet and sour chicken!!!!

I am repulsed. Will not EVER order from here again."}
{"text":"I have finally found my go to delivery spot for greasy Americanized Chinese food! After trying several others (Cook on Wok comes to mind) that fell short, this one so far has been far better than anything else I've tried in Vegas. *note - for \"fake\" chinese food, clearly this place isn't authentic and doesn't try to be! 

All of the meat dishes come in \"small\" (which is still very good sized for 2 people). Be sure and ask for the small size if there's only a few of you or you want to try a few things. 

Pork fried rice - classic greasy chinese food staple. Plenty of pork!

Sesame chicken - the best rendition of this I've ever had. Sticky, sweet, crunchy, delish! So far no weird chewy chicken pieces that I usually find in Chinese food dishes

Mongolian beef - very spicy and I wasn't loving the beef.. kinda chewy. This one I won't be getting again

Dumplings - good for chinese delivery, but nothing to write home about

Crab ragoons - the best ones I've had here. Getting the perfect blend of \"crab\" and cream cheese is an art and these guys rock !

It says no MSG... there's probably some trace MSG in the food or something, but I can say I do feel fine after eating here - which is more than I can say about most asian places in town. Delivery was quick, prices are reasonable. I'm in love."}
{"text":"I love this place... One of the best Chinese food restaurants on this side of town.... I recommend to everyone
Sauteed Garden Vegetable Combo w/ veggie egg rolls and yummy thai tea boba"}
{"text":"I actually really loved this place. The parking was super easy to find one close to the store and I wish I asked the server what his name was he was humble and very kind. Each person that delivered our water entree and boba drink were super sweet and the food was delivered extremely quickly. I get annoyed when people say service they don't like the service I'm from Hawaii and honestly Chinese people are hard amazing workers they don't try to kiss your butt for a tip they're straightforward and seriously put a lot of passion into their work and food. The food portion sizes are ridiculous we went during their lunch special hours and recieved a huge plate for 7 dollars. You can't beat that loved the atmosphere food and service not to mention their bobba is amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delivery time was a little long, but that's a price I'm willing to pay for lazy! LoL! I ordered Kung Pao Shrimp and added mushrooms, medium spice level, brown rice, a side of egg rolls and pot stickers. My family used to own a Chinese restaurant back in the Midwest for 25 years, Chinese takeout in Vegas has been very disappointing, so this is based on that. The veggies were fresh, shrimp was large and fresh as well! Pot stickers were seemingly homemade - which I enjoyed and for the long wait time, the egg rolls were surprisingly crisp. As for the flavor, the pot stickers and the egg rolls were pretty good, the Kung Pao Shrimp was a little lack luster on depth, a bit greasy, & what I would consider a little too spicy for a diner's \"regular\" palate - I can handle spice though. Added some soy sauce and a bit of salt/MSG to waken up the flavor and it was okay... :/ The sides were tasty, and the visual appeal of the Kung Pao Shrimp was exciting...so I was disappointed by the sauce in this dish. I'll try a different dish next time...worth a second shot."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. My girlfriend and I don't cook often so we usually try to find good take out places. This place is really close to our place and the food is great. We ordered two lunch specials and I'm impressed with the quality and quantity they give you. I ordered the kung Pao chicken and my gf ordered broccoli with beef.There is enough to have left overs. I recommend it to anyone who's looking for some good Chinese food. I'll be back to try out some of their other entrees."}
{"text":"We love this China a Go Go!  Great cashiers and the delivery drivers are always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Ordered food during lunch time for myself and other coworkers.  They came to deliver the food.  The chicken wings were so black it looked like it was deep fried 5 times. I called and complained and they advised me that they couldn't do anything about it but send more chicken.  I got the chicken they resent and again it was black and looked like it was deep fried more than 3 times.  There were items missing in my $60 order that they stated on the phone they could not replace.  I took the 2 containers of chicken plus the one item my coworker ordered and went to this place.  I told them the chicken was so disgusting and black.  They told me that was how they cooked their chicken.  They told me over and over again that they put the crab rangoons in the bag with the wontons and I kept telling them that they were not in there.  The staff proceeded to show my pictures on the menu and at that time, I told them all I wanted was a refund.  The lady argued and argued and didn't want refund my money.  I kept telling the lady that I was on my lunch break and couldn't even eat my food because they messed everything up and on top of that, had to drive over there (after I asked for delivery) to return the fried chicken that was black.  China A Go Go was on the \"Dirty Dining\" segment on the news and I will NEVER eat at CHINA A GO GO again! The staff at this location was rude and hesitated to refund my money ( which I got at the end) and yet advised me never to come back...I told her I was never going back and neither were the other 300 employees that I work with.  GARBAGE FOOD!!! don't eat there or at any other location!"}
{"text":"This place let me start off by the number of pleased customers I seen walking in the door I knew I made a great choice of food. Their customer service is exceptional!!! They really take pride in their satisfication of the customers needs and accomadate accordingly. Food was just exactly how I imagined amazingly prepared and cooked to perfection. I will definitely be a returning customer and will continue to use their services. Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Always very consistent, very good food and amazing staff! Definitely happy to have in Southern Highlands. 
Usually order the chicken teriyaki, honey walnut shrimp, and the chicken vegetable. Always fresh and good. 
I recommend this Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"The only reason they are getting a four start of because we are in restaurant, they give you paper plates and plastic ware. The food was fantastic! Mother ordered sweet n sour pork. I ordered wide noodle chicken and hot garlic shrimp. Definitely coming back but will bring home lol"}
{"text":"Last time the food was excellent. This time it is dry and lukewarm.  The service staff is worse than the food. All they want is your money and then they dont help you after you place an order in togo. My food was sitting at the counter for 7 minutes while the staff just stare at you in aw. Not a smile in site from 6 employees. With that said, it felt unwelcoming, almost to the point where you are bothering the employees. And the kid that took my order was very effortless that had no energy to lift his fingers to help out. I was the only one in the restaurant at the time. I give this place one more chance before I stop coming here."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed, their customer is good and the food is always consistent. I'm not gonna lie.... I like Chinese food more than I should. If you like chicken wings, try their wings here."}
{"text":"China Go Go has fresh food and it' not greasy like most Chinese restaurants. Kids enjoy the food as well as the adults who have tried this restaurant.  Everything is great off the menu and it's not pricey.  If you have an urge for Chinese, you have to visit here.  Awesome food."}
{"text":"It's official. I think I'm addicted to Thai Tea and Boba drinks. The first step is admitting you have a problem, right? I discovered Thai Tea at a Farmer's Market a few months ago, and haven't been able to get enough of this stuff since. Same thing for boba, except at first I didn't care for it but now I crave that shit like it's crack or something. 

After a failed attempt to go to our usual boba spot, a Yelp search revealed that China A Go Go sells boba! Worth a shot, right? I called ahead to make sure they were open (it was 9PM) and the girl who answered was nice enough. I ended going up with the Thai Tea and my husband got a Taro slushie. Unfortunately for us, they were out of boba. Boba is half the fun! We were pretty disappointed.

THIA TEA ($3): I've never had a bad Thai Tea. Sure, I like some better than others but I was content with the tea here. I though it was weird that they used Coffee-Mate creamer in the tea, though.
TARO TEA ($3): The employee made this from scratch. We watched in fascination as she got the ice, water, sugar, and scoops of taro and blended it into a giant slushie. We got the idea that maybe we could make Taro slushies at home! Anyone know where to buy some Taro powder?

P.S. I've had takeout a few times here in the distant past. Foods 'aight. I've only tried the vegetable chow mein and spring rolls. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Next time, I'll call to confirm that they have boba on hand. My tea drinks simply aren't complete without boba.

{"text":"Rice and fried rice was good.   But the orange chicken was only meh.   The chicken pieces were fatty and chewy.    Food came quick and was hot.   My cousin enjoyed his shrimp fried rice.   I'm gonna order elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Went there last night, we ordered the General Chicken, sesame chicken, organge chicken, and chicken chow mien. All was excellent!!!!  Crab rangoons were also delicious.  Only thing we didn't care for were the egg rolls, they weren't horrible by any means.  We will be back for sure. Staff was great, fast and courteous.  Glasses never were empty."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for take out Chinese food.  Everything is always fresh and flavorful. The staff is always friendly. Glad we found this hidden gem. And reasonably priced to boot!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The sweet and sour chicken was my preferred style, not too battered. All other dishes we ordered were good. 

The only reason it lost a couple points was that my son found a hair in his teriyaki. It clearly wasn't his. I know when I was picking up our take out, most of the cooks had longer hair and not covered. 

That grossed us out a bit. I know it happens, so we will probably try here again."}
{"text":"Food: Bland to say the least. Everyone eating was surprised how plain the food tasted, Chinese food typically being so flavorful!

Ordered delivery, first surprise was the \"MILD\" shrimp. Just to spicy for a child to eat so was off the menu for her. Hot and sour soup had seafood in it, ordered plain. Usually this would be a plus but had a guest whom did not care for seafood in the soup.

There are plenty of other Chinese restaurants in the area, keep trying."}
{"text":"I've dined in and the food was hot and fresh. But recently ordered to go and it the total opposite. Room temperature and far from fresh. I don't recommend ordering to go. I will say the delivery guy was super courteous."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm hungry and don't really know what I want, I head to this restaurant!   It never disappoints me at all.  And they are open on most holidays and are open late.  I really like this place.  And if you want to try something good, I love the Chicken and Broccoli.  Super good and super fast!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and think it's OK.  I've been amazed both times how quickly my food comes to me after ordering.  Literally, like 2 minutes.  Are they just heating it up when I order it? 

But the portions are large and the prices are good.  The food just doesn't seem \"authentic\" to me.  But it's not bad.  

My favorite is the lunch special.  For under 7 bucks you will get a meal with fried rice, noodles, and soup.  The portions are over the top for lunch but leftovers aren't bad.  

The place seemed old and not spotless.  The fingerprints all over the mirrors and door kind of creeped me out.  Do they clean these at all?  The booths have tape holding the material together but the tables and seating seem clean.  

All in all an OK local spot for chinese.  Don't travel out of your way."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken are always good. Friendly and  fast service"}
{"text":"We live 2.4 miles away from this restaurant and the manager has refused to deliver to our address, claiming that we live more than 5 miles away. The customer service here is the absolute worst, and if there was an excuse needed to NOT do their job, I would hope in the future they make a more educated one. If your customer service is that bad at least make the food worth it. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious chinese food. Came out fast and fresh. Big chunks of chicken in my teriyaki bowl. And they granted my request for extra teriyaki. Love the Honeydew slush with No Boba. The Shrimp for a appetizer was delicious. My friend had the Walnut shrimp. It was alot of food that she couldnt finish it, and the prices were low."}
{"text":"It's convenient, fast but ok. Don't expect to be impressed by the food just expect Chinese Food. It's affordable and it's good for take out."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Your food arrives hot and fast. Some of the best Chinese food in the area. Fantastic lunch specials. Great family menu also. Prices are great.  So if you are looking for service, quality and price China a go go is your place."}
{"text":"China A Go Go, more like China A No No.  The food was nothing to boast about, and the service goes just along with it.  My fianc√© ordered a small container of chicken and broccoli, and although she ordered the broccoli to be cooked well done, it was undercooked.  The chicken was tough to eat, and they definitely make sure to put a lot of broccoli and not a lot of meat.  For $12 for a small container of food, I expected there to be a good amount of meat.  They do not honor their own coupons, and unlike other Chinese restaurants, they do not offer free egg rolls or sodas with a minimum purchase.  I won't be going back here unfortunately, as first impressions last, especially when it's so expensive. Definitely not worth it :("}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant, a friend suggested I order the Singapore noodles. The staff was so friendly I had a very nice experience! The food was great! I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed... Fried rice was oily, to go container it was in looked nasty.   Orange beef was ok, not the best I've had.   Asked for sweet and sour fish,  was not what i was expecting.   Chow fun was good.   Moo gu chicken was ok.   Our first experience wasn't a good one.   Sorry China a  Go Go"}
{"text":"You know what's great when you have 2 cars in the shop and the third needs a battery? Yes, a black Amex would be nice; a sugar daddy even better. But, none of those were happening last night. No, what was happening was ridiculous amounts of Chinese food. True, we need the money for deductibles and such; but sometimes, you have to splurge.
My favorite things about China a go go are that they have bbq spare ribs and three different vegetable dishes. I really prefer the spare ribs to the slices of pork that other places have. Not only are they fatty and delicious, like me, but they remind me of Chinese take out, as a kid, in New Jersey. The sauteed veggies are delicious. If you like a heavier sauce, I suggest the Buddah's delight.
Delivery is pretty prompt and has always been accurate. The driver last night seemed surprised to be getting a nice sized tip. It was good to make someone's day better.
The food is good, service is good, and there is always a special or coupon. We need the coupons. Remember, two cars in the shop!"}
{"text":"Ordered Kung po Chix.  Was greasy and the chicken was all dark meet. Egg rolls and soup were great"}
{"text":"While the food was ok, they shorted me 2 soups, 2 egg rolls, and 2 crab rangoons.  I don't like getting ripped off, so that makes China A Go Go, a no no!  $28 for $20 worth of food.  No thanks!  It's like buying a 20 ounce coke, and only getting 16 ounces."}
{"text":"I've been to about 3 china a go go's around town and I can definitely say that this location is one of the better ones. It's next to the Von's on windmill and Bermuda, across the street from bachi burger.
I came with my husband during his lunch break because I was craving cheap Chinese lunch specials and this location was the closest. We went in and the waitress was kind and told us to sit down anywhere. I was quite impressed that they had booths and looked like a cute little restaurant since most other china a go go's look like only take out locations. There was only one other table but within, no joke, about 10 minutes, the place got packed!
They bring you crispy wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and egg drop soup (only for dine in) as you wait for drinks. I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special for about $6, expecting something small and greasy, assuming you get what you paid for.
It comes out in to go boxes and that box was FILLED! My husband and I looked at each other in shock at how much food they give. We could already tell that we weren't gonna be able to finish it. It comes with both chow mein and fried rice and the food was piping hot/fresh.
I love Chinese food and I grew up eating authentic Chinese food so if you're looking for that, this place isn't it. But if you're looking for really decent quality Chinese food for dirt cheap, then this is definitely the place to go (especially this location, really clean)."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some delicious Chinese and ordered delivery from China a Go Go. Orange Chicken, BBQ Pork, Egg Rolls, Crab Rangoons. Everything was on point, exactly what we were craving! And delivery estimated 45 minutes and they arrived at our door within 10 minutes!! It was incredible. Great portion sizes, too."}
{"text":"The service is great. Very friendly. Try the Taiwanese Mei Fun, it is delicious!!! I love the thin noodles. Their egg rolls are my favorite out of all the one I have had. I am here once a week!"}
{"text":"I discovered China a Go Go when I made my way to Barnes & Noble in The Best of The West Shopping Center. I was very surprised when my sweet waitress brought my Buddha's  Delight to my table which was vegetarian with tofu. Outstanding and the portions were generous. I ate off it the next day.
Tonight I ordered delivery through Eat 24 and not only was their menu easy to order from, the very kind delivery guy was there way ahead of what they said.  I had the dinner for 1 with sesame chicken and The Emperor's Delight a LA cart. For $24, including the tip, tax etc I can eat off it a few days! I couldn't buy and make it myself for that!"}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars mostly to how rude and unhelpful the staff were. However the food was actually great and very reasonable in price. It just sucked that the staff seemed more preoccupied with their phones than serving customers"}
{"text":"Been going here for years!! Love their food.. Love that I can access the menu online and put in my order that way..."}
{"text":"Don't do it!! It tasted weird so I stopped eating it. My boyfriend ate my food and next thing I know he's vomiting and stuck in the bathroom. Expensive food poisoning."}
{"text":"HOLY SPICY KUNG PAO CHICKEN!

whoah they aren't kidding when they say it's spicy!  Fast, affordable, and tasty.

Tons of food for the lunch portion, like I could've made 3 meals out of it."}
{"text":"I love China a go go, fast service, excellent food & friendly staffs, reasonably price...
I order the Hong Kong crispy noodles, orange chicken and shrimp fried rice..."}
{"text":"Best \"China A Go Go\" out of all three. You know it's good when actual Chinese people go and eat there. And they don't use Mexicans to cook the food like Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Had China A Go Go for delivery the other night. I prefer this place over my bf's favorite (Chop Stix).

Ordered Thai Tea (I like how it's made there and not the canned kind). Pepper beef was so delicious (too many mushrooms--it would've been better without it, since my BD and I had to pick it out). Orange chicken is orange chicken (for me, the best take out Orange chicken comes from Panda Express). General Tsao's chicken was yummy too! I enjoyed it, BD wishes there were less veggies (I enjoy veggies, I thought that they had the right amt).

We ordered Lo mein for my little one w nothing in it, BD enjoyed it even without it! I love this place for Chinese take out--they're decently priced and food is good.

Didn't see much crab in the rangoons and the rice was hard the next day (that's usual for most Chinese places though).

I've ordered taro boba from here before too--and it's just as good as the places in china town."}
{"text":"Always dissatisfied and disappointed with their food so I've stopped going. Their beef is like rubber and orange chicken is dry. Their fried rice has no flavor and neither does their chow mein. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. The kung pao chicken was spicy and delicious. The sweet & sour pork was good, about as good as most other Chinese restaurants. But the Mushu pork was amazing and my favorite thing I have eaten there so far. The portions are large enough to share between 2 or 3 people depending on how much you eat. My friend and I split 2 entrees and an order of dumplings and we have enough leftovers for another meal. They also serve some great boba tea. Prices seem good to me considering the portiob sizes. Definitely one of my favorite places for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Lunch special was excellent!! I love hot (temperature) Chinese food and this place does it right!!! Sweet and Sour Pork super good!!! The lunch special soup was tasty! They stacked my plate! I'm satisfied!"}
{"text":"Quality has deteriorated to the point where I drive 15 minutes in each direction for Chinese food now rather than get food from here, 60 seconds from my house."}
{"text":"So it was one of those nights, feeling lazy, tired, hungry and not in the mood to cook. Nobody wanted to get in the car and go get anything and all i could think about was the delivery Chinese place we used to call in LA. SO we found China A Go Go on line. They have a great selection and the prices are not bad. We had a few people eating so the order was large and they through in some free egg rolls and Rangoon's... So Delicious. The order Showed up faster then promised and was HOT. I cant say anything bad about this place and was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love this place,  best Chinese ive had. The honey walnut shrimp is amazing! Also you must try the sesame beef and the crab rangoon."}
{"text":"I have ordered here 3 times in the last few months. Every time I've received my food, it's hot and fresh. The delivery is lightning fast."}
{"text":"...Some of the best Chinese food I've had in town! Phenomenal service. Quick. The lunch specials are cheap and have huge portions. Try the cream cheese rangoons! To die for! 

..I don't live anywhere close to this place but whenever I want Chinese this is where I go. Try it , you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of China A Go Go.  I made sure to be here the first week it opened.  They have great dishes and the family style service is a plus.  I have never had a bum meal here, nor have I had bad service.  I can't believe I haven't been here in the past 6 months.  Funny how fast time flies.  Anyhow, here is my review from my last visit.  It'll probably be a short one as we just got take out.

I called China A Go Go and ordered their Meal A.  In our order was Broccoli Beef, Orange Chicken, Egg Rolls, Fried Rice, White Rice and Won Ton soup.  

We pull up and found a parking spot right out in front of the restaurant.  

As we walked in we were met at the front by a hostess and she took care of our order.

Within 5 minutes of getting there, our order was up front double wrapped in plastic with all of the plastic ware, napkins and chopsticks.  

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I love China Go-Go it's my favorite place to eat. The leftovers are great for lunch at work the next day, if there are any. The Mei Fun Noodles I get those every time."}
{"text":"The home made egg rolls are excellent.. beef chow fun is good ! And service is very friendly, we support China a go go"}
{"text":"I love this location. I used to go here at least once a week until I moved across town. Awesome lunch specials, fantastic staff and great food fast. Vegetarian pad thai is my fave, but the house chicken is to die for and the Mongolian beef is good too. :D 

Plus its in the smiths parking lot so we you can grab a bite before grocery shopping."}
{"text":"Oh I miss my old china a go go on Ann and Decatur. :(  This one is closer to my new apartment and they fall way short.

I called in my order for vegetarian pad thai with extra noodles and a thai tea. When I showed up they were rude and gave me a dirty look when I asked for crunchy noodles. My Pad thai was ok, but not as saucy and delicious as usual and kinda cold. 

 I have always been a steady regular at the other one, but I guess I will have to find a new chinese restaurant. Shame. :("}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food, excellent service.  The employees there are kind and generous.  Love having leftovers for the next day.  They deliver within so many miles, too."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was very good. We got the chicken fried rice, paper wrapped chicken, shrimp pad thai & sesame chicken - none of which was really good. The fried rice was horrible. I don't know why this place is so busy."}
{"text":"My order took forever. Instead of 45 mins, I ended up receiving it after 1hr and 30mins. The lady was so rude that she didn't let me cancel my order and charged my card right away. I ordered shrimp fried rice but there were only 3 shrimp. Never gonna order here again."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Chinese food I have ever had! Everything was mushy! The pad tai had jalape√±os in it which I've never seen and didn't like. The egg rolls were bland and the Orange chicken was not very flavorful."}
{"text":"Dont go here that egg drop soup gave me a virus found a dead mesquito.in it...im not coming here anymore"}
{"text":"I love the food here and the service is excellent . Love coming to this place. The hot and spicy chicken and chow mein is very good"}
{"text":"I love China a gogo! The order taker was great, I called back to change my order. She did it with no problem! :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant. Good food, great prices. Check them out. Cream cheese Rangoons are lit."}
{"text":"OK - this place is for serious cheap and fast food...  Mostly pick-up orders.  The dining are is super tiny and people going in and out all the time makes it an uncomfortable place to eat.

The food - it's not that good.  I have a number of dishes but recently tried pad thai.  It was fettuccini tossed with scrambled eggs and almost no other flavors.  There was no peanut flavor or sweet-savory flavor.  

It is cheap with huge portions, but seriously lacking in flavors."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place.......

- open kitchen
- freshly prepared
- delivered piping hot
- large portions
- very reasonably priced
- close to home
- attentive staff

Great place for quasi-Chinese food.  Much better than Panda Express but not as good as several places in ChinaTown.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've been here before many times but this is my first time reviewing it. 
China A Go Go is sooo delicious. They have good customer service and always check up on you and makes sure you're alright. They take your order quick and you receive the food quick also. 

The lobby is always clean and ready for more customers. 
I always order the beef with broccoli and it tastes wonderful every time! Definitely recommend if you are curious of trying China A Go Go."}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE FOOD in VEGAS!!!! My favorite part is they deliver. The chicken chow mein and honey walnut shrimp are to die for. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I like this China A Go Go, it's not better then the other one on lake mead but the delivery guy is nicer"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Nothing special. I've tried several dishes from this place and I've had better, but it's decent for a Chinese fast food restaurant. They deliver as well with a minimum of a $10 purchase.

FYI: There sweet and sour chicken has little to no chicken in there."}
{"text":"Bland and almost inedible. 

Just ordered delivery. Weren't able to through the app as it said they weren't taking delivery orders now but called and they took my delivery order. Ok. 

Woman was nice enough, took out our order, and it arrived on-time. Man who delivered was nice enough as well, weren't many words exchanged. 

The issue didn't start until we opened the food up. At first sight, everything looked like it had been watered down. Soggy looking orange chicken, almost looked like sweet and sour, and the chow mein and rice was so light-colored with barely any other additives (just all rice and noodles) which didn't quite make me excited to eat them. It looked like a plate of Chinese-food-porridge. 

It tasted as expected from sight. Very unappetizing and I couldn't even finish it. The chicken was soggy, oddly sour and under-seasoned. Noodles were bland, only a faint garlic taste. I felt like I was eating Chinese food at a senior citizen's home. 

So disappointing. In reading the other reviews, I wonder if the owners are just tired or have lost their passion? Everyone said the food used to be good. I'm afraid, big name chains are going to take over this business if they don't step it up. 

I don't care how close it is, you can get food delivery from almost any part of the city now in the same amount of time with all of these other services. We will order elsewhere. 

#No-No-a-Go-Go"}
{"text":"This is the best China a go go I've visited. Some friends suggested it and brought us here for lunch, and truthfully we hesitated because we didn't find the other locations to be anything other than mediocre. We were pleasantly surprised. Not only was the food hot, and really tasty, it had large portions (on actual plates not styrofoam like other locations), good service, and a good overall atmosphere. We tried the house special chicken, Mongolian beef, orange chicken and shrimp chop suey. Basic Chinese fare but done pretty well, I'm happy to say."}
{"text":"We love this place, the food tastes great, service is quick, portions are huge, and prices are so awesome!!"}
{"text":"We just got our food here to go. This place is OK. They pack the shizzzles out of our food for what price we paid for. I'd come back here but there are other places I know I can still try. This place only has a few reviews and I thought I'd help out other yelpers before they come here.

But it's not as good as I thought it would be. Decent Chinese food for a great price."}
{"text":"I've been to other china locations in town and this one is terrible, food portions are smaller,most of entree items came out barely warm, my soup came out cold, they didn't have big spoons to fill the individual bowls with soup easier, their water tasted bad, they had old dirty looking plates. I will still eat china a gogo  but definitely not at this location ever again. itd be best to just close this store because it gives a bad name and image to the other locations."}
{"text":"I love love love the crab rangoons even though I hate fish there is absolutely no fishy taste. They taste like cream cheese rangoons, which i love, but they are the best ones I have found.  We have tried a lot of items on the menu as well as ordered when relatives came and everyone loved their food.  My mouth is watering as I am typing this and now I will have to grab lunch from there tomorrow! YUM"}
{"text":"Went here today on recommendation of friends.  They love it.  I ordered takeout.

When I walked in, there was food on the floor that needed to be swept up at the entrance and there was food under every table.  First sign of disappointment.

When I picked up my to go order, I noticed the man behind the counter cooking the food wasn't wearing any hand protection as he was grabbing food from different containers and dumping them in a boiling pot.  Second sign of disappointment...

Won't come here again..."}
{"text":"Order Sesame Chicken, our favorite, Hunan Beef - too spicey, fried wontons - always yummy and Wonton soup which was awful, it seemed to me it was Kitchen Sink Soup, not your usual Wonton Soup.

Have been going here for years, however it seems like quality is going down.  Plus when you put in a pickup order and they ask for your phone number, you would think they can just pull up your usual order, we go every 2 weeks or so for the last 5 years."}
{"text":"Ordered SHRIMP egg fu youg, had it delivered. When we opened the  bag the smell of shrimp was strong, as I was eating I noticed a smell of Ammonia.  I smelled a couple of shrimp, they smelled so strong. Not that I was going to continue to eat, but I  went online to see reasons why shrimp smell like ammonia...they are spoiled!  The worst part was when I call the restaurant the person there said \"we freeze the shrimp until we need them\" REALLY? I immediately drove over and got a refund and let them know I will not be back.....all while being told there was nothing wrong with shrimp, she \"was sure of it\"."}
{"text":"Never again.... Got wicked food poisoning. Wish I could have given 0 star but wanted to warn others.  
Besides the horrible food poisoning the food was mediocre at best, the sauces were soupy and bland."}
{"text":"My man and I went here for dinner tonight.. I ordered orange chicken & fried rice ; I was impressed with how much food I got for the price. Orange chicken was okay but not the best.. I wish there was more chicken inside... The rice was really good though.. Cooked perfectly and seemed fresh.

Jaycen got the appetizer delight. He wasn't super impressed .. His fried shrimp was cold & the BBQ rib \"slices\" were weird tasting he said and seemed old. He said the rest was okay though. 

All in all it wasn't the best Chinese. Still looking for a good Chinese place in Vegas...

On a plus side, the iced Thai tea was really delicious - I would come back just for that lol! But the guy taking our order couldn't even tell us if there was caffeine in it or not.. Uh ok? lol"}
{"text":"I always eat here but today my food was cold n the chicken was hard n dry. Was not happy didnt finish. $40 waisted"}
{"text":"The food was entirely inedible. Had the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was cold. The egg drop soup was off and the service was terrible. I've never not eaten what was placed in front of me but we are all leaving our food. I strongly recommend you go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Close to my new home. Happened to spot this place the other day and thought I'd give it a try . Had the Won Ton Soup, BBQ Sliced Pork and the Combination Chow Mein. Everything was pretty tasty. This is definitely just a take out place but they have few small informal tables if you want to eat there. They threw in a couple of Crab Rangoon for free. Not bad!
This may not be traditional Chinese but for neighborhood take out or delivery with fresh quality ingredients and balanced flavors , this fits the bill!"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable price. Close to other shops. Friendly staffs and fast delivery."}
{"text":"Let's say you're in the mood for some Chinese food. Nothing fancy, just something to satisfy your craving, and you don't have the motivation to drive to Chinatown. Well then this is the place for you. The food isn't bad, typical Americanized Chinese food, but it's close by and it quenches the Chinese food thirst. So if you meet the above criteria, give this place a try. You probably won't be disappointed, I wasn't."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese in Vegas... Good prices HUGE portions and flavor is greAt .. Hard to find good places for Chinese but this place is pretty good ! Egg rolls are tasty and like their chicken chow mien , Kung pao is also tasty!"}
{"text":"I was excited that a Chinese food place opened nearby. I just was craving orange chicken and ordered pick up here when it opened. I was a little sad that I didn't check my order. It looked like sweet and sour sauce on chicken and tasted like it. Maybe they mixed up my order but I was just too hungry and tired to go back. I only ate my rice since sweet and sour has pineapple in it and I'm allergic. My husband ate it and said it was sweet and sour for sure. He liked it lol. I'll give it another chance one day :)"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place to eat. It's very close to my home. The food & staff is fantastic. I eat here at least once a week if not more. I love their Thai boba tea and garlic shrimp with a crab wonton appetizer! It is so amazing! They really take care of their regulars too. I would eat here everyday if it were possible. It is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad  dish at China a go go. Everything is flavorful and the portions are a good size.  It is a bit on the expensive side I must admit, but you get what you pay for.  When you enter you are greeted and asked if you would like to sit down or take your food to go by very friendly hosts.  My favorite dishes are:

-mongolian beef
-honey walnut shrimp
-shrimp and chicken pad thai
-the mei fun
-chow fun

all very delicious.  They also have two versions of lunch specials available until 4pm!

:)))"}
{"text":"I love that they are quick here  and the food generally tastes good. I go for the lunch special. It comes with a lunch portion of a few popular menu items(e.g. Mongolian beef, honey walnut shrimp, Kung pao chicken, etc.) , rice, and chow mein. It costs about $8 after it's all said and down which is \"ok\" for a lunch special, but I wish that it at least came with a regular size soft drink or something."}
{"text":"The rating is more like a 3.5, but that option isn't available yet. Haha. Anyway, I just stopped by here to get my Mongolian beef fix and I must say it was some of the best flavor and portion wise.  I got an order of Mongolian beef and pork fried rice, which totaled $14+. Maybe it's just me, but that seems kinda steep for take-out for 1.  The service was quick tonight, but I've heard that sometimes it can get pretty busy, so call ahead.  Everything was flavorful and tasted good, but my only gripe was the fact that my whole container of bbq pork fried rice were fat pieces and not meat :/  Next time I go I will steer clear of that or politely ask them not to do it again."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is lacking.  We chose this location because it also serves sushi, which is a favorite for one person in our party.  He comes for the AYCE.  I am concerned when he gives his order because they never write it down.  My daughter and I ordered from the Chinese food menu.  Our appetizers and meals; so all of the hot food,  came out before any sushi.  Halfway through my meal, I finally had to approach the register where the staff was standing and ask them where his sushi was.  They never brought it all out.  One waitress finally asked him was that all, but because it had taken so long, he couldn't remember the names of the other rolls he ordered.  To make it even worse, she brought out the check right after that and came back a few minutes later asking if we we're ready for her to take it.  No.  We were not done ordering.  The check should arrive after the meal,not in the middle of it.  One person was not done since they just barely started getting things out to him.  
So many places no longer care about the quality of service they provide."}
{"text":"I love this place ! If I want Chinese this is my partners and mines first pick. So fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"Everything was good the food was hot. I can say my mother in law got a hair in her rice not sure how but other then that it was good for me."}
{"text":"Well..in my wifes and my quest to find a new chinese fiood place to replace our favorite Egg Roll King in Reno we stopped in for the lunch specials. I had the orange chicken with fried rice and my wife had the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and we ate there so we had the egg flower soup as well....Verdict?...the food was good reasonably priced and we had take home, as well so we will be back. Saw a couple reviews talking about the rude service and the girl that brought us out our food was a little...ahem ...abrupt...lol...but I dont care...Ive had jobs I hated dealing with \"customers\" who were jerks and inadvertantly probably went off on a couple decent ones so it didnt bother me at all...Young lady find your happiness there or get a new job...u seem miserabke...did appreciate the smiles as we were leaving. Bottom line good chinese, decent price just lowere your sensitivity level when you go..lol..and it will all be good..Later"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner, and it is perfect for nights I don't want to cook, but also do not want to drive through and get a burger.
I love that I can order through Yelp, and my food is always ready VERY quickly.  
The portions are always enough for dinner and lunch the next day which is a great bonus.
We frequently order rice, noodles, and egg rolls. Which considering we always reorder, is great! 
Customer service is always spot on as well. 
I would recommend this place to others for good and quick Chinese food."}
{"text":"Oh wow !  this was different and i was glad. Its fast chinese food / take out. but very different from the others..... Ordered delivery. Came on time nice guy. Food was hot lightly packaged old school style in the cool little box . no bulky foam box with dripping plastic bag around it.( thank god) Got veggie chow- mein. Very good! no mystery slime sauce all over it for flavor, just good noodles and a garlicy scent. So good i actually thought i was eating chicken lol.. but i wasnt.

Really like the little container of ORANGE sauce. Refreshing flavor."}
{"text":"I'd like to give 4.5 today if the option were available.  We stopped here for lunch on our family outing.  As always, the staff was pleasant and friendly.  They were attentive to our needs and gracious with the portions.  We even received complementary egg drop soup and Chinese donuts!  

Between the four of us, we ordered crab Rangoon, shrimp fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and vegetable chow fun.  Everything was fresh and tasty! 

We eat here, or order takeout or delivery, occasionally and we are always happy. The only reason I would give less than 5 stars is due to the cleanliness. It's in need of a makeover and thorough deep clean, but they never disappoint with flavor and great service!!  I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Ok food for the price, awesome service. Fried rice and wonton soup are really good. Affordable delivery fee."}
{"text":"Cheap good Chinese eats!

I had the Mongolian beef, it was right up there with the some of the best authentic Chinese restaurants I've had here in Vegas. The name made me think \"Panda Express copycat\"  at first, but it was a 9/10 experience food wise (which is what really counts if you aren't some blueblooded high roller)"}
{"text":"Went for Thai tea boba.  Perfectly made!  They brewed the tea like how it's supposed to be (not powder or pre-made stuff).  Filled it up 3/4 of the way. And the rest with coffee mate creamer.  Yummmm. Definitely the spot to go for boba from now on.  Speaking of boba it was soft and squishy- the kind you can kinda chew on or shoot at people through the boba straws."}
{"text":"This is actually a really good Chinese local place in town. They recently opened and they are really clean and friendly. The chain has been on tv for not having so cleanliness place but this location is brand new so i wanted to try it before or if it gets a bad rep. I have not dined in yet. But have gotten take out from this place and I love about two to three miles away and by the time I get home the food is still very warm and steamy. Their fried rice is very good and their chow mein is also very warm and good. I would recommend you try this place at least once. It's hard to find a good all around Chinese local place to eat other than on the strip or Chinatown. Also they give u free sodas while you wait, not sure if this is a regular thing or just while they started."}
{"text":"Good place for quick Chinese food. A little better than your Panda take outs. They give a lot of food for the price. Beef Broccoli is always yummy don't care for the noodle that they make. it is a little thicker than your chow mein noodles, and smaller than your upon noodles. 
Boba drinks are alway bit with me, all the flavors are good with or with 9ut the Boba in it..."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time! Love it, great service and easy ordering process. Love the won ton soup when the family is sick."}
{"text":"This was a very nice and fast dining experience. The food was served quickly and was hot. We were given appetizer treat at no charge of fried shrimp and they gave us a Chinese calendar as a gift I look forward to coming back again. I had the healthy Buddha and it was excellent"}
{"text":"For a good while I was really enjoying this place because they have some of the best egg foo young that I've ever tasted. Today I wanted to try something different and had the shrimp pad thai. When i got my food i saw a small black dot on to of the noodle. When i look at it an placed it on top of my Styrofoam plate i saw it was a roach!! 

I am so absolutely disgusted. They offered to make me something else but im like Hell Fck no...give me back my money!"}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times over the years. The service is good as well as the food!
Our favorite is the egg foo young.  Always consistent and good!
You get plenty of it, there are times we have even shared it!
The place was is always clean.
We have brought several friends here who like it as well.
We would for sure go back and I will update then."}
{"text":"I was a fan but not anymore. Whenever we eat here we get bad service. The staff forgets about us or takes forever taking our order. One time we had the egg rolls and noticed they had a very strange odor as if the cabbage had gone bad."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food for cheap, what more can you ask for? (the sesame chicken and walnut shrimp both rock)"}
{"text":"They were featured on Dirty Dining . don't eat here. Look through the pics and see how they left food... COOKED FOOD sitting outside"}
{"text":"Real good late night chinese food and on time deliverey service as well. We ordered 3 entrees, Mongolian beef-very good and right spicy, kung pao chicken-good, and honey walnut shrimp-to die for. Also, I said I had a coupon but didn't, they needed to actually have the coupon, since I didn't have a coupon,they gave us free wontons, which were really good. Thanks! I love this chinese spot and we will be ordering again. Ps. They said 45 mins and they were on time."}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't too good. Nothing compared to Yama sushi. Don't waste your money here. Took my little bro for the first time to try sushi and he hated it.."}
{"text":"Be prepared to eat like royalty. Clean restaurant and fresh foods and beverages are wonderful. Order the passion fruit slush boba you won't be disappointed. Aloha"}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS so good! I love there beef and broccoli! I always get the Taro Boba it's addicting. I love taking friends there if they have never been."}
{"text":"The food is rockin' and the portions are big! Everyone was friendly and the restaurant was clean and neat. Finally a decent Chinese restaurant in my hood."}
{"text":"Great or excellent Chinese food is a challenge to find in the Henderson area.  I used to be okay with China Tango and with inconsistent food that they've been generating, has me turned off.  
China A Go Go, definitely heavier on the oil factor is a little more flavorful than China Tango in Anthem.  In terms of service, they are both friendly and efficient.  The dine-in is just more upscale at China Tango.  

The price comparison is about the same, the food is okay, but no where great.  Beats driving to Chinatown, so I guess I'll settle.  Our normal staples are Mongolian beef, Singapore noodles, broccoli chicken, Szechuan chicken."}
{"text":"China a gogo is my go to spot for Chinese food to go around my house. Over the past 10 years, my roommates and I have been religiously ordering from here. Personally, I am a huge fan of their crab rangoons, shrimp in lobster sauce, salt and pepper shrimp and quite a few other dishes. Speaking of which.... I may just order from them this evening for dinner. 

Yummy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great because it is convenient, good for groups, children and connected to a sushi spot as well. It is also clean inside and recently renovated.

The only downfall to my experience here was the so-so tasting food (which at grand opening tasted as if it had more love put into it and now tastes just like any other Chinese take out) 
Adding to that, upon coming in to the time I left, I had been helped (somewhat) by at least 5 different people. They had a handful of staff and ALL were rude, impatient, and unprofessional.

All in all, it just lacked care for the paying customer.
Not the best experience. Not the best food. But it got me by."}
{"text":"Had the lo mein with shrimp. It was good. Service was good :) have come here a couple of times now. Always clean"}
{"text":"Convenient at the time....

I ordered fried rice and egg rolls to go, about thirty minutes prior to closing.  I was craving it, but not anticipating the longer drive to my regular spot.  Fast service, as friendly as you'd expect right before closing time.

I was not entirely okay with the floor being mopped while the guy was still cooking someone else's food as I could see the water splashing precariously close to the stove top. But since the cook was talking and laughing over and into the wok; I figured a little floor water wouldn't hurt, right?

Because I was starving, I convinced myself that the heat killed any germs. There was something mushy in the rice, the pork. The texture was unfamiliar, which is why I specifically order pork fried rice and egg rolls (overcooked, tooth breaking lyrics crunchy): to test the place out.  Being from New York, that's the easiest way to find out whether or not the place is up to par.

Unfortunately, I will not be spending any money here again."}
{"text":"This convenient joint has quick service and tasty entrees that are consistently very good!
I usually get a shrimp dish, but this visit I had Moo Goo chicken. This was a great choice and they don't cheat on the chicken or the veggies! The entree  was so fresh and delish. 
When I mentioned quick earlier, I wasn't kidding. It's almost like they anticipate your order before you get in the door! They had my meal ready literally less than 2 minutes after I ordered. 
Most entrees are around $10, which is a pretty fair price, especially considering the speed of service! 

The parking is never a problem in my experience. There are a few other quick serve restaurants adjacent to Go Go but I've never had to park very far away. 
I recommend you Go Go here soon and try some tasty & lightning fast Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Always like the fresh hot food here. My favorite is moo shu pork, a delicious mix of pork, veggies and egg with moo shu wraps. Service is quick and portions are huge!
I'm sure Green Valley is no match for China Town, but in the 'burbs I love to Go Go go here!"}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS delicious here, short wait for the entree's, I recommend for anyone looking for great fast Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I would love to say that China A Go Go-Valle Verde is awesome. There food is bomb as hell. Great delivery and very very fast. Always CORRECT and always respectable. We order all the time. Jin is the gentlemen that answers phone most of the time. He is very kind and CORRECT on ordering.like this evening I called and ordered my food by another employee and she is just as great as Jin. Sorry I don't have her name. Anyways she took my order we hung up and guess who called back? Jin  because he knows I like my rice a certain way and saw I didn't order it that way. I just forgot! And he said hey don't you order your rice this way? And I said yes I do . I said thank you for the call  back it was very kind. That's some customer service and care.If they are not the owners they deserve a raise for sure. Thanks Jin and very nice lady sorry I'll have to get your name. Keep up the awesome work & food. Oh yes shout out to very fast delivery driver's you all are great!"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood shop around. Our favorite entree is the orange chicken, especially when you ask them to make it spicy!"}
{"text":"We have great time there.  Massive food and good service. we've got spring roll for free after order."}
{"text":"I thought with a name like that, how good could the food be, but it is the best, a little expensive, but it makes you wanting to keep coming back for more and more and more!!!
YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY"}
{"text":"I am an addict! I've ordered 3 times for delivery in the past 2 weeks! The food is ALWAYS FRESH AND GREAT!!!! Love love love!!!!!!!! Every single time it's great! Every time!!!!! 
Try the teriyaki chicken! Or the walnut shrimp! Or anything there! So good!"}
{"text":"WOW just WOW ok not the video game but food. .After struggling to find places in Az that tasted this good on first try. The Best Veggie Hot and Sour Soup everrr large flavor and sour and spicy like I like it !. Crab Rangoon was amazon done correctly can taste all the stuffing part witch is the best. Also tried the General Tso's chicken I normally rate Chinese places solely based on this dish cause I have seen it butchered alot either being a dark brown sauce or overly spicy or no sauce. I noticed right away this was good had 2 large chilli peppers in the box being a spice fan I was like yes please. Like stated these are large portion sizes so pull up your big boy pants and enjoy. I was even happy that they got all the sides like dipping sauces etc.. I got delivery and took 30 -45 on friday threw grub hub however I am shure there times vary but well well worth wait. I will try singapore noodles next ! Ohh and happy hour and lunch specials avab. this is better then panda express in my opinion"}
{"text":"That's an enjoyable place. Very good food for a very fair price. Great Neighborhood Restaurant"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a China a Go Go location. I have heard good things about this place by friends and have been excited to check it out. 

I came here for lunch with a coworker. We ordered some pot stickers and the eggplant and tofu entree. Our food came with egg drop soup. The portions were enormous. The two of us were able to share the entree and still had about half left to take home as leftovers. The food was prepared quickly and was extremely fresh for a fast food type of restaurant. The prices are also fantastic. 

I'll definitely be frequenting this location for lunch more often!"}
{"text":"This China A Go Go is a decent fast food option in the neighborhood. They offer many coupons and discounts and the owners here were accommodating to our requests and very pleasant.

Don't expect gourmet Chinese food here but you can expect decent Americanized Chinese food for a good price."}
{"text":"Great experience! 

Ordered delivery through Grubhub. Our order arrived early, and we were extremely pleased to find that the restaurant was able to cater to all of our special requests (ie no tofu in the eggplant, no veggies in the chow mein).

All of the food we ordered was delicious. The flavors were all correct and well balanced. My eggplant was cooked perfectly, and I loved the addition of thinly sliced jalape√±os that gave it just a little kick. The orange chicken was mild and sweet, perfect for our youngest child. The paper chicken was tender and flavorful.

Also, the kids meals are a terrific value. Huge portion that made 2 meals for my kid.

Can't wait to order again! :)"}
{"text":"Fair, not good/great.  Server brought my wife a cup of Egg Drop soup, but told me I couldn't buy that size for Hot and Sour soup, so I had to get larger bowl.  Right!  Good soup, though, but a wee too tart.  Oh, H&S soup should have ground pork bits in it, not shrimps. Potstickers had tasty filling and dipping sauce, but the wontons/dough they were wrapped in was way too thick/doughy.  Egg rolls were very good.

Main dishes - wife had Pad Thai.  Bad idea; never go cross-ethnic in a foreign cuisine restaurant.  The dish tasted fishy.  My dish was General Tso's Chicken.  Chicken was processed kind w/ strange chew/consistency and individual pieces were over-fried.

Restaurant staff were friendly and smiling. Building was clean and decor modern.   Background music was some kind of Asian rom-pop, which was a bit of a distraction.  All-in-all, not a bad experience for our annual \"A Christmas Story\" Chinese restaurant semi-reenactment."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, my standards for good take Chinese food was set high. Nowhere in the past cities I've lived on the mainland had proved to meet the Hawaii standards. Yes I know I'm being a snob but I know what I like and nowhere has come close. Except maybe this place. China A Go Go does give me some hope in the Chinese take out world as most of the food has not disappointed. I've tried various dishes-beef broccoli, honey walnut shrimp, HK fried noodles, chow fun, orange chicken, egg drop soup and a few more and most have been very tasty and limited on their greasiness.  I've ordered from here a few times and the wait is never long and service is friendly too. The prices are do-able so until I'm able to make it back home, this place will work to fill my Chinese take out needs."}
{"text":"On a cold day sick in bed, I was craving some soup and comfort food. This place really delivered! The chicken fried rice was excellent and the wonton soup hit the spot. Best of all, I requested extra ginger in my broccoli dish and they really listened!! Thank you China A Go Go!"}
{"text":"China A Go Go is stuffed in a big mall well an outdoor strip mall any way and the sign was a little obscured by a tree so I almost didn't see it. But I did and I went in and ordered a half order of sesame chicken and wow did it come out fast. Sure am glad I only ordered a half order because I think it was enough to split especially with the plate of rice that they gave me with it. Too bad I didn't have a friend to share it with. Next time I'll know for sure. The menu seems extensive and they do have quite a bit to go trade where people are coming in to pick it up constantly while I was sitting there eating. The flavor was nice these portions were huge and I think a lot of people in this neighborhood are enjoying some real nice Chinese food.. I think there are a lot of people around here must be repeat customers. It would help if you could order in Chinese because I think they're English is a bit weak. But hey don't worry even if you get something you didn't order it'll taste good and in my case I didn't get something I did order but I still had enough so I was happy so go get them give it a try see what happens"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST EGG FOO YOUNG IN LAS VEGAS, hands down! It has the thick, light brown sauce you'll find back East, not the thin dark brown sauce you find out here. And, the portion size is huge...easily sharable among friends.

I'm from New York, and this is as close to \"New York style\" Chinese food as I've found here. They also appear to have New York style \"chow mein\" (which, in New York, consists of some either shrimp, chicken, or some other meat, with vegetables in a gooey white sauce...not a noodle dish).

The wait staff was friendly and super attentive. They frequently came over to make sure everything was okay.

The only down side to this place is the lack of a vestibule (set of inner and outer doors) to provide a buffer from the elements. When the doors open in the winter, you get a blast of cold air, and when they open in the summer, you get a blast of hot air. So, the restaurant can have uneven temperatures, necessitating the use of a jacket or sweater in the winter. But, other than that, this place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"After ordering delivery the food arrived quickly, before the estimated time. The food was hot and delicious. After ordering from other places this is definitely going to be our go to!"}
{"text":"Lunch menu is the way to go! It's EVERYDAY even on the weekends till 4 pm. Great portions. If you dine in, you get egg flower soup. Service is always good whether you dine in or take out. Boba drinks are also tasty! Sometimes a little stingy with the boba!"}
{"text":"Very excited to find a quick, cheap, typical fast food Chinese place so close to home.  Food and prices are good.  My husband loved their Singapore Noodle (that's his thing at Chinese restaurants).  Kitchen is out in the open and looks clean.  We'll be eating here pretty much whenever we're craving some Chinese."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food is delicious. I went there twice per week.They have lunch special on 11:00am to 4:30 pm, I love Mongolian beef is very very good, the beef is very tender, and the Phad Thai noodle is very good also, and the most important thing is that their service is awesome, I can tell that they are very caring and respectful towards every customer, when I leave they always wish me to have a nice day."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese take-out restaurant. I've ordered from a few different China A Go Go's and this has been the best location by far. I always get the shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, and chicken chow mein.

The delivery time is average to any other Chinese takeout restaurant. They all take about a full hour to get to your door. This place is definitely worth the wait. 

You'll be satisfied with this place."}
