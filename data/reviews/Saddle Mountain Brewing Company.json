{"text":"Awesome place! Great food, beer, and people!  Try the Mouth on Fire Burger if you like spicy, it was delicious!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm from Tucson and we were going out with some family friends and we decided on here since it was a Friday night and only 30 min wait,  everywhere else had closer to an hour wait for the chain restaurants.  After a glance at the menu they had house made pastrami and I was sold.  It came out fairly quickly and man was it good.  I will definitely go back just for the pastrami"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great atmosphere, great food, beer is tremendous. Wings for sure, fish and chips the best, burgers a must and I'm sure everything else is just as good. We went on a weekday and the service was phenomenal, so if you go on a weekend when its packed Id imagine you'd get weekend service you get anywhere... Quit whining and enjoy a badass place in the west valley."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are great as well as the fish tacos.   Service was quite poor though.  Only saw waitress once since ordering our food. No waters on our table and would've had another beer.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. The waitress refused to serve a large group food because we weren't sitting although there is a table against a wall with stools we were willing to sit at. She also said she had too many tabs and ignored our group for an hour! Then the general manager said we needed to sit and would serve us once another group left.  Again,  we said we would sit at the table against the wall and he also refused to serve us any food and only drinks. I said I was going to leave and the GM said \"good, don't come back\"!  Sad since they have a good menu and drinks. Will NEVER go back!!! This was a large group of professionals willing to spend a lot of money. Stay away until there is a management change"}
{"text":"Went here with my parents. Very small and cramped.  Your sitting shoulder to shoulder with people you don't even know. Service was slow. Everyone was nice.. but slow. The waitresses chatted a lot with their own friends instead of taking care of their customers. My mom's food was delicious but my dad was very unhappy. He specifically asked for certain things not to be on his burger and they did it anyway. I think this was partially on the waitresses since they don't write anything down you say. Also, asked for our check and it took them ten minutes to get it to us and no the waitress gave it to us with no pen. Took her a while to come back with a pen since she was socializing.  Just overall not happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Father's Day dinner was delicious! We had a party of 10 and Britt and the team did a great job. Love the beers and my wife loves the Mojitos!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Good prices. Came here on a date and had a great time. The man loved the beer choices. Staff was super nice."}
{"text":"Presentation was really good and give you a lot of food. I got the pastrami which was really good. My wife ordered the bison burger and they recommended that she get it medium-rare; so she did. They brought her burger out well-done... Made no sense! They were really friendly but super slow and under staffed. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good, great drinks full bar and beer. Excellent food, bar staff could use some guidance."}
{"text":"Tonight was the soft opening of Saddle Mountain Brewing Company. I found out from our server that it was supposed to be just for the contractors that helped to open the restaurant, but it turned into a busy opening night. 
Being a busy opening night, there were a few expected opening night problems to work through:

First, it was busy and it took a while for our server to come by but once she did, the service was good. 

Second, not all of the beer they offer was available but the ones they had were quite good! More to be available later in the week. 

Third, the server recommended the beef dip sandwich and, after ordering it, I was informed that they were out. I then ordered the chicken sandwich and was very pleased with it. The chicken breast was cooked perfectly and the flavors of the sandwich were excellent! Certainly a good second choice. 

For an opening night, I was impressed! There were only minor issues that were to be expected for an opening but I'm sure it will only get better! It's nice to see a place for good American food and microbrew beer on the west side! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty beer choices, friendly staff, typical pub grub food but with extra effort put into freshness and quality. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Similar to what our reviewers stated, the food is way overpriced for what you receive.  However, the beer... oh the beer... This is what it is all about!  At least once a week, we bring in our growler to get it filled up with SMBC Strawberry Bit*h.  Yes, this is what the beer is called. If you love low IBU's and fruit forward beer, this is it!  Very drinkable and BIG on flavor, and it fills you up after 3 pints. Now if they just lowered their food prices, we would be dining in there on a regular basis and not just occasionally."}
{"text":"Having moved to the area recently, Saddle Mountain has quickly become one of my favorite establishments. The beer they brew is excellent, I'm an IPA snob and their Ray's Gold IPA is an outstanding example of a well brewed west coast style IPA. Also, they serve hard alcohol and have a full bar; that's a major perk since my wife isn't much of a beer drinker.

The food is excellent, my personal favorite being a chicken Alfredo and roasted pepper pizza they make. But you really can't go wrong with anything from them. The service here has always been outstanding. Their servers are knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. If there were anything negative to list about the place, I would, but I honestly have had nothing but positive experiences here."}
{"text":"Went here and LOVED IT! the wings are outrageous  in love. Everything was great. Beer I think is maybe lacking for something on the menu that isn't so 'hoppy' and would like something that is actually pretty versatile or seasonal. Was disappointed in that area but the food and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat when visiting town. Great brew, generous food portions, and lay back environment. We have had their burgers, sandwiches and appetizers. All yummy so far."}
{"text":"Great beer, but just okay overpriced food.  Burger was average and the Rachel Pastrami sandwich was good, but not worth $14.00."}
{"text":"I like Saddle Mountain because it's very close to my house. That being said, beer is just ok. It's pretty much just your typical brewery and nothing special. My favorite is the Hop Snob, a west coast style IPA. The food is hit and miss. Last time I was there on a busy night, I ordered a cheese burger. It came with no cheese, and was so dry and not seasoned. It really just tasted like very well cooked ground beef. The turkey avocado club is delicious and pretty much my go to. It's huge so I always have lunch the next day. It's a pretty fun atmosphere. We like to sit at the bar but it's usually always too crowded. The bartenders are the best. Very attentive and quick. Never have an empty glass in front of me. They also serve up some pretty great mixed drinks for those that don't care for beer and the pepper vodka is awesome and a nice delicious spice to their bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes after ordering before food arrived.  Several beers on menu were out, and waitress seemed clueless about choices and tastes  of beers.  Food was good when it finally arrived, but had to wait for her to come back and ask if we wanted more drinks.  Had to ask for water halfway through meal.

Restaurant theme is mixed with airplane memorabilia  throughout restauramt \"Saddle Ranch Brewing Company?\"

Owners need to train hostess and servers on customer service and details about food!!"}
{"text":"My party enjoyed their drink selection and thought the food was okay. My burger was nothing spectacular. We did not like the Caesar Salad and had it taken off of our bill. But it is overall a solid restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. My mother and I usually go during the late afternoon and it is always hopping with people at the bar and eating dinner. The servers are AMAZING espically Sierra! Everytime my mother and I go in we pray Sierra is there, we LOVE her! So sweet and you can tell she enjoys her job. We love talking to her she is so funny. The food is even better then the service. They have the BEST pesto chicken pizza and the appetizer board with meats, cheeses, and veggies is to die for! (cant remember what they call it) The atmosphere is great. I love how its not too quiet and the lay out of the resturant is very open so tables arent on top of each other. I love Saddle Mountain and will continue to come here whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"I had a very good Bloody Mary and a Bacon salad that was very fresh with an wonderful vinaigrette dressing. My husband ordered an amber ale that he said was very good with an outstanding pastrami on rye.  I tried the pastrami and it rates as good as any Jewish deli I have been to in Miamii, Detroit or Chicago!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times since they opened hoping they could fix the hiccups. Sadly they have not. The service is slow no matter where you sit. I have dined on the patio, bar and inside and without fail slow service each time. Went in this past Wednesday at 6pm. 6 tables open...hostess said there was a 30 to 40 minute wait. When asked why the wait she states there are only 3 waitresses and the didn't want to fill the open tables. Needless to say we left. 4 other parties elected to wait the 30 minutes they too were told. The times I have eaten the food was just ok. Sometimes the rueben was dry. Fries were soggy. The beer is delicious however. Stout is great. In the future I now know just to fill a growler and take home and grill my own food. Unfortunate the service problems have not been cleaned up since the opening as I was hopeful to have a new hangout."}
{"text":"Very good beer and a huge selection, but the best is their smoked pastrami...just amazing. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I usually find a lot more redeeming qualities to a place. However, Saddle Mountain Brewing Co. was a disappointment. We did not eat in, but had take out a few days ago. We had the Jalapeno bombers, Fish and chips, and the Rachel sandwich. The bombers are plain jalapenos that are stuffed with sausage and have cheese. They are supposed to come with an avocado aioli but we did not get any. They were a bit greasy from the sausage but were ok although not the traditional finger food we are used to. We had to use forks. The fish and chips were also just so so. The filet was a little thin and the fish was ok but not the \"cod white\" that I expected. The problem was that the batter coating was a little too done and hard to bite into, not a crunchy mouth feel. The fries were only so so and not very memorable. There was ketchup and mustard packets provided but they had something on them that smelled like someone had sprayed it with room freshner.  I imagine some cleaner of some sort got spilled on the items. So we didn't bother with them. The absolute worst part of the meal was the cole slaw. I've never had bland, tasteless coleslaw in my life until now. It seemed to be made with just a little watered down mayonnaise. It was dry and honestly had little or no flavor. It had no tang or any sweetness (depending on the style you like). It really did nothing positive for the sandwich.

Unfortunately the slaw was also on top of the Rachel Sandwich. The sandwich just wasn't very good.  We always want juicy, succulent pastrami and this was very, very dry. The bun was a basic pretzel bun but there was almost no sauce and nothing else to give the sandwich any flavor. A good mustard would have really helped.

Since we didn't order any beer, I can't give any information on those. But we probably won't ever go there for food again. It just wasn't very good, way too expensive for what we experienced, and not worth our hard earned money."}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars Bc of the service I was given this white girl I forget what her name was but she was a salty ass bitch she had an attitude for everything.That's why she only got a 1.50 tip the place doesn't close until 10 and she asked if we wanted another round of beers but looks at her watch like she doesn't wants us to order another round that's why we left and went someone where else to continue drinking."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! Great place to hang out. The service is on point! The food is bomb-diggitty! Caesar Salad is so good, it's a must have! Side note: ask for an extra side of Caesar dressing and dip your French fries in it! Holy Moly is that delicious! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the burgers delicious. Well def be back, glad to have a brewery in Goodyear."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see a brewery and family-owned restaurant come to the area!!! No more chains! This is pretty much the only place we go out to eat anymore. 

My husband LOVES the beer! I'm not a beer drinker, but they have a full bar and awesome cocktail and wine options to keep me happy! The food is also great! They make things fresh daily and are very proud of what they serve. We've had everything from pizza and wings to burgers, and one of my favorites is the green chili plate. Keep up the good work SMBC!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went in this afternoon for lunch.  Amazing!  We got the flight of beer so we could taste them all.  My husband got the 'Purist' Pastrami and I got the Triple B (burger, bacon and BBQ).  Of course we shared and it was so delicious.

The Pastrami was out of this world.  It did not have any one flavor that over powered the sandwich.  It blended so nicely.  The triple B.....oh my!  Huge beef patty, loads of bacon and it wasn't drowned in the BBQ.  Definitely the best burger I have ever had.  Same goes for the Pastrami, it was perfect.

The Hostess was very pleasant and patient as we were looking for a good seat that accommodated the best visual for the football game.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Definitely coming back to this place.  Loved the decor.  It was simple, inviting and had the vintage feel.  Over all best place in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and hang out. Food is good and the music playing over head is nice. Beer would be great if it was served in cold glasses. Do not like warm beer. And we have gone a couple of times and its always warm beer."}
{"text":"Awesome brewery in the west valley. Great brews and food. Been there about 15 times."}
{"text":"Solid beers across the menu. Above average brewpub food with some excellent choices. Pork Verde was newsworthy.  Service (Vanessa) is excellent.  Good energy throughout and solid values."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the west valley and were excites to know that there was a new brewery in town...beats the drive to Tempe. My husband and I both ordered \"mouth on fire\" burger. The burger okay but the meat was cold and insipid. We went for lunch and I spilled my drink. I tried flagging down my waiter but she was nowhere to be found. When I finally got her attention, she advised she'd get me a new drink but was too busy to find a mop. Drink never came!! She never came to check on our table (party of 6) we were all disappointed. Beer was amazing."}
{"text":"Great beers, food needs some improvement. Bison burger was dry and tasted boring. Fries greasy and old. Overall slightly pricy place with gear beer, avoid the bison burger."}
{"text":"Smbc is breath of fresh air from the chains we are used to on the west side. We have been there many many times and each time are happy with the experience. Servers and staff seem to truly care about the patrons and are invested in this family-owned rarity. On my most recent visit, I wasn't sure which beer to try. The server asked for my bottle beer preference, then asked the bartender to determine a good match, and finally brought me a couple choices appropriate to try. My daughter requested warm milk, which the server poured into a coffee mug and warmed for her. Our service has always been above and beyond- enhanced by the owners, Laura and Jacob, who are usually on-site and mixing with their patrons as friends. Don't spend your money on a corporate chain with little vested interest in the customer- try out SMBC! Great food, delicious beer, and more importantly spectacular service!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and a wonderful selection of craft beer brewed on site. However, the premises is not handicap friendly. The handicap parking is far from the entrance and the sidewalk is blocked by the beer garden/patio no wheelchair can fit. A wheelchair is forced to go into the parking lot to reach the entrance."}
{"text":"We love to come here. Good food... And getting much better than when they first opened. For the most part staff is great. Have had a server a couple times we really don't like but everybody else, especially bartenders and managers are great! Beers are amaaazzzing! Nice to have a good brewery on this side of town. We love to go see their liver entertainer Seth too!"}
{"text":"After three visits, I'd say that Saddle Mountain is a work in progress. 

This place has plenty of potential.  Nice atmosphere.  Great microbrews.  Ample pub menu. 

The fish sandwich, burger, and pizza were all pretty good.  On my last visit, a friend ordered the spinach, strawberry, and grilled chicken salad.  The salad was wet (over dressed), the stawberries were frozen, and they substituted field greens without telling her that they were out of spinach.  

The wait staff is friendly and polite, but  clearly inexperience.  They are not up to speed on the menu and beers, and haven't mastered the skills of efficient table service.  

I'd love to see this place succeed.  The West Valley needs a variety of good dining.  Hopefully the owners will step in and provide enough oversight to make this place a great success.  Wishing them well."}
{"text":"Craft beer is decent I tried a few the hop was a little much so they tasted similar to me.  I do like hoppy beer though.  They need a better wine list granted for a micro-brew I suppose this is not a surprise. Food and atmosphere is great.  The bartender was a joy."}
{"text":"Am so happy this little brewery is in town now.  I am not a big beer drinker, but others in our party were and enjoyed their selections.  The food was sooooo good - everything seemed homemade and absolutely delicious.  Odd location, but love having a yummy choice on the far west side.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Brand new to town. Our very own micro brewery. Hookah!!  An aviation theme but from the 1940's so if you love beer and flying but not the fed's this is the place for you. Music at the moment is great. Pink Floyd, The Eagles, George Harrison etc but that just mean I'm getting old. The atmosphere is laid back and relaxed and family friendly. Here's hoping they do well. Good luck guys."}
{"text":"We first ate there last Friday and loved it so much that we came back the following Wednesday.  Both experiences were top notch.  First time we had the beef dip, fish N chips and a pepperoni pizza & shared an appetizer of the pretzels with mustard.  SO good.  Out of this world cole slaw and perfectly cooked everything!.  My husband had the Flight beer sampler so that he'd know what to get next time.  So last night, our 2nd visit, we had the Yum Bison burger (hubby), the classic caesar with chicken (our son) and the classic burger (no longer on the menu BUT the waitress said it would be no problem to make it for me.  We also had chips & salsa and shared the mediteranean app plate (please keep that on the menu.. it's SO good).  Our son loved his salad.  Our burgers were cooked to perfection, hand pressed patties, super soft gourmet buns, toasted, the meat kept it's warmth until the last bite.  To our surprise, Wed's is called Pint Night where 2 beers go on sale and there's a competition to see which ones sells the most by the end of the night.  Whichever one wins you can come back the next night and buy a growler full on sale!  (guess where hubby is stopping on the way home today.  The entertainment was also phenom...a very talented young man who sang & played guitar.  We will definitely be back there again & again.  LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Come here if you want a sports bar feel without the sports bar crowd. The craft brews are unique and delicious, the food is yummy, and the service is good! It's a little noisy, but you can fix that by sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"The Hubby and I have tried it twice. I cannot imagine what would bring us back. 
--The first visit had us excited to try their flight of home brews. It is heavy on the hops and the dark end of the brew scale. We also added three beers they do not include in the flight. Their beer alone would not bring us back. The second visit I ordered the house recommended Bloody Mary. It was what I would expect but nothing special. I like spicy stuff, salsa, etc... but I hate it when bar tenders think they need to over spice a drink just because it is possible. If you crave a Bloody Mary like I do and appreciate the tomato mix and veggies ask for the maker to cut out some spice. 
--The first visit the Hubby ordered fish and chips. Absolutely nothing close to special. Run of the mill. Tiny fish serving for the $12 cost.  I ordered the tomato soup (soup of the day) It was just a bowl of soup. The second trip in the Hubby ordered the Ray Ray with the coleslaw on the side. I don't know who could have eaten it with the slaw on it. The amount of Pastrami and other toppings where to heavy for the ARTISAN bun. If fell apart and he had to eat his burger with a fork. We mentioned to our server to pass along that the bun was not up to the job.  I ordered a Ruben which was huge. If you are all about the amount of product you get this is your place for a sandwich. If you want a meal that will stuff you go for it. I on the other hand would have liked a sandwich that was not overly greasy and too much to finish. 
__Over all we are not impressed with the food. Just serve a normal amount of well done food. This is a place we were hoping would fill a missing link in the west valley... a home brewery. Not even the beer will bring us back."}
{"text":"We had a party of seven and was told it was a thirty minute wait. With three open tables we offered to split out party up but the hostess wouldn't seat us saying the tables were in different stations and the kitchen was backed up.  It's a brewery, why wouldn't they want us seated ordering beers?...we left."}
{"text":"Looking forword to a brewery on the west side, what a disappointment. There was no beer or drink menu. We asked our server what kind of beer they had...She could not tell us. The food menu had very little options. Our server took our drink and food order. My husband's flight came out, but I waited 15 minutes for my drink. Waited again for our food She lost our order. Our server .came back again and asked us if we wanted dessert...We told her we never received our dinner!! After 3 times we finally received our food...not good. Will not be back. Not enough T.Vs either. What a waste of 2 1/2 hours"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, Beer and Service!  Already looking forward to our next visit here. Highlights are the IFR oatmeal stout and the Beef Dip sandwich. Expect a visit from the owner, Jacob, too!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great beer. I am a hombrewer and they love to talk about their beer, if you have a question they are more than eager to grab a brewer to ask questions. My new go to in the west valley for a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour. Great deals: beers $1 off and $2 off other drinks!  The Oktoberfest beer has a great balance of malt and hops.  Sat at the bar and had prompt service from Lacie."}
{"text":"So glad that we noe have more options on the West Side! This place has some awesome food, esp their pretzels with beer cheese and beer. What else can a girl as for :) great place to hang out for a drink or 2 and good times!"}
{"text":"For my first time here this place knocked my socks off! Service was exceptional. The buffalo burger is heavenly. A little over cooked but otherwise great! BEERS ARE INCREDIBLE. Their seasonal beer list is constantly changing. Stop driving by this place!"}
{"text":"Can't believe we have a hidden gem by us! This place is great, good eats and live music which is not too loud that you can still carry a conversation with your group or date. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Beer was good. Food was good. Environment was a little dead and older than I'd prefer for happy hour but overall good experience."}
{"text":"First let me say the burgers were excellent . Beer was great as usual. Love that Ray's gold IPA.  Wait staff was good.  Attentive and prompt. The only complaint we had tonight was the French fries were not fully cooked and came out warm not hot.  We have been to this brew pub many times over the last few years but this was the first time for our guests.  A little slow on the service but a busy place so you expect that."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! Atmosphere was great. Staff is friendly and attendant. Food was delicious. We had the fire burger and triple b. Fire burger was definitely fiery! We had a few different beers. They have a good selection of local beers. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have stopped here a couple times now, this first night, our server was friendly and attentive. They were super busy, but no one was overly panicky. Food was pretty good, trying to be fancy but county at the same time. Not really sure where the thought were going with it. Anyway, cool little spot. 

Now the next time we went, server did good, until she shorted us on change. Granted .94 cents is just not that big of a deal, but it's the principle. She would have a great tip between the 3 of us if it weren't for that. We were sorely disappointed, won't be paying cash here again. Had this been our first visit, the place wouldn't have gotten 4 stars... That's a bad first impression for a new place trying to make a name. 

This isn't my first go to stop, but it's decent quality and price."}
{"text":"I aint gona lie the beer is good heavy and potent. The women most are very polite and attractive. Pizza is reallt good too.if your a local chicano stay away.its also a snobby place.workers are way too sensitive to street humor and slang. I went in a little tipsy to begin with. got a little flirty. not too loud and no bar fight. anyways over a month later im told I am not welcome here no more.oh well just beer spot.my money is exactly the same as the next costomer.I can spend it else where .thats what beer does to people. Gona get loose and voices will raise with anybody.fuckem"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and the ambiance is great, very laid back like a dive but not grimy. The beers are amazing, and they cycle a few out every so often. I used to like be the food, very creative and tons of flavor. The burgers were great, they had this great dish Chicken and biscuits that was SOOOO GOOD. However when I went there this last time, I asked for my burger medium rare and got a burger that could still moo I swear. I tried to eat just the outside and make due, and gave up pretty quickly. My burger honestly did not even seem seasoned. I didn't send it back because I just didn't want to be \"that\" customer. (It was pretty late too) this morning I tossed up only uncooked beef with my coffee. I don't know what they've done to the menu or the burgers but they used to be great. I will not be eating from here again."}
{"text":"Great service, and good food. The place seems always busy and fun. I like the beer matching with each dish, not mention the bartenders all seem friendly."}
{"text":"I really liked the stuffed mushroom appetizer and they have a nice selection of beer! All the appetizers that I have tasted are delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally an original on the west side. Great selection of house beer. Love the bison burger with a glass of taildragger!"}
{"text":"We went Friday night for the grand opening. The food was excellent beer was good and the atmosphere was terrific."}
{"text":"Tried this place two times now, including today. Good atmosphere. Good food. Pretty good beer. I had the jambalaya first time; Chips salsa and wings today. All food good. Wings a bit chewy. Jambalaya pretty good. Had sampler tray of beers each time. I like their beers quite a lot. Not too hoppy. I don't usually like stouts but theirs is good. 

Seats comfy and I like most of the setup. However: Tvs are mounted way too high. Crick in my neck each time I go. 

Service is marginal. Even though not very busy, and plenty of servers standing around, didn't get checked on much. Funny- asked for 3 things end of today- the check, more salsa and a napkin. Did not get napkin. How tough is it to get all 3? Consistently average service. Too bad really. 

I like that they have happy hour on Sunday's. Decent prices. 

I'll try again but really hope TVs get lowered and service improves."}
{"text":"I like the idea of supporting local businesses, and I've been to this one a decent amount since it opened a few years back. I honestly haven't been here in 6 months or so, but my family decided we wanted to go there tonight to experience their Oktoberfest. The service was decent as always, and the beer had the funny aftertaste it always has. The first meal I had there was a Rueben or Rachel, and was impressed with the flavor and amount of meat in the sandwich. It kind of reminded me of a NYC type Deli sandwich. My meal tonight was sadly disappointing. There was more bread than meat on my plain pastrami, the bread was crusty, and the flavor wasn't that great. The food seems to have gone way downhill, and $17 for a crappy pastrami sandwich and onion rings is too pricey for what you get. I'll go pay less for typical bar food at Augie's or somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good brew house environment but seating/bar/waiting areas are extremely limited when they're busy.  Good beer selection, food prices are a bit high for what you get."}
{"text":"Second time here.  I think they are getting better.  Working the kinks out.  I still haven't found the killer dish on their menu.  I tried a pizza on the first visit and the french dip the other night.  I'm still looking.

The chasing tail amber the other night was excellent."}
{"text":"Good food...unique menu but not always the fastest service. My husband and I like to visit local joints and this is one of them. However, some of the staff have not been the most courteous but it seems to be improving. Ambience is great!"}
{"text":"My wife absolutely loves this place. The drinks are great and the food is tasty. My son also enjoys the menu items. The service is good and you feel welcomed as soon as you enter the establishment."}
{"text":"Okay was going to try and be cute (I said try) and make a picture that read I don't always drink beer but when I do I do it at Saddle Mountain Brewing Company. But not only am I not cute but apparently I have no usable skills either. But to all of the people on my face book page if you are looking for some great food, great beer and some good music visit Saddle Mountain Brewing Company and if you are not looking for the above mentioned go there any way and support your local Brewery."}
{"text":"Great brewery and eatery. Had the turkey sandwich it was really good, but the Rachel is unbelievable, the smoked pastrami is so good, and it comes on a pretzel bun!!!!! It comes with coleslaw, but get it with sauerkraut and you will not be sorry. Cool atmosphere and the service was great. I will for sure come again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"300 Ft Steve is worth the visit.
Pretzel bites and Thai wings are both very good.
The Rachel and Reuben were good but some bites of the Reuben were impossible to chew (tough corn beef).
Beef dip is good but Bistro Steak was not worth it (too small, too tough, sides are nice though).
Will be back for burgers and beers."}
{"text":"First trip here was decent. Second trip was great. Our server was personable, beer was cold, food was hot.  

Their house wings are made of crack, I'm not sure what is in this sauce, but I would totally buy it if they bottled it.  They have a poblano cream cheese that goes on this insane fire burger-seriously the burger is not for the faint of heart. Heartburn for days. However, the poblano cream cheese left me wanting more. I asked for it to be put on the Rachael instead of 1000 and slaw and it was amazeballs!!!!!

Beer is pretty good, decent selection of low IBU's, which I like. Wish happy hour was a bit more plentiful, but at least they have one. 

Seating layout is weird, lighting on the southeast side could use some help. 

Overall it's a win, I'm beyond happy to add a non-chain place to the rotation."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a brew and snack after finding out our dog had to be put down. Very good beer. Had the warhawk and the funnel bubble. They both had good qualities but I like the funnel better. It has a abv of 7.7 which makes it strong yet drinkable. The jalapeño poppers were different than anything I had ever tried. Very spicy and good. Definitely recommend this place in West valley if ur in area. BTW ask for Bailey for your server. She will explain everything in detail and is cute to boot."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza Italian not impressed.  Lots of cheese 

The chili was like red beans with chili powder    Beer nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Great food. Great beers. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice microbrewery. Be careful with the hot burger it can be very spicy in my opinion."}
{"text":"The beers are excellent. The food is also very good, nice selection as well. My wife and I eat here at least once a week. Great selection of beers and always have new ones to try. Service is always fantastic, this place can get real busy but waitresses are always taking good care of people. I lived 45 years in the Northwest and it is known as the micro brew capital of the world. Saddle Mountain is as good as any northwest brewery and that's saying a lot. You need to try this place out!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would.  Gave our name & group count and then waited an hour & a half watching others being seated ahead of us.  We talked with Panda a few times with promises of seating.  Yes there were 8 of us, but tables could have been moved together to seat us.  Fortunately the bartender was pleasant and friendly while we waited.  As they prepared our table, we were told it was for someone else who came in later (we overheard they were frequent customers).  Panda relented and seated us but we ended up leaving without ordering because the other group was so nasty to us.  Would never return - horrible experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the staff is cool. Oh and the beer is pretty amazing. Grabbed a bison burger, 5G pull and a 300 ft Steve. Pretty legit."}
{"text":"Tried this place for birthday dinner. I'm not a picky person and understand when it comes to the food and bar industry but the service was lacking. Our server was quick to run from our table after getting our drink order and dropping them off. It took 15 minutes to get any food ordered when the restaurant was no where near busy. Besides the less than stellar service, the food was good. Jalapeño bombers were amazing and wished we had ordered a second helping as there is only 4 per order. Hopefully with a little more experience this place will become a favorite."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a non-chain restaurant that had good beer. On a Yelp search, much to my pleasure, I found the Saddle Mountain Brewing Company. When we arrived we immediately were greeted and seated. The place is clean and very inviting. It was not overly noisy and did not have screaming kids. As we were sitting down our waitress greeted us and we talked about the beers. I selected the Amber that had a great flavor that went very well with my Pastrami sandwich. The meat was piled high and had a great smoky flavor. It was balanced with coleslaw and a dressing with a unique flavor. My wife had a Mojito and the Rueben sandwich. It was equally generous with the meat. She really liked the flavor and was complimentary on the dressing that was on the sandwich. Overall a great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"I came from the east valley to get a gift card for a friend that enjoys your restaurant. You guys don't do physical gift cards. Do you actually think that people want to send gift cards via email? I understand it saves money to do it this \"new and innovative way\", but you just lost business. I hope he likes Rudy's BBQ. 

Update: another customer informed me that she was able to purchase a physical gift card. That's great! Maybe all that is needed is staff education of both gift card options."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and really enjoyed both experiences.  The beer was excellent.  We have ordered beer flights each time and we really liked every beer we tasted.  The food was very good.  Our group enjoyed burgers and the smoked brisket sandwiches.  The servers were friendly and professional.  It is a great place to go."}
{"text":"On our \"date\" night we decided to go to the brewery last night on St. Patrick's day.  I have to say we will be going back again!  Everything we had was amazing!  From the beer, to the food, to the dessert!  I had the Rueben and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger...both were exceptional!  We could not leave without trying the drunken brownie, it was delicious!  Looking around at everyone's food everything we had seen looked so good, and we can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Ok, can you say hipster?
We can, so can Saddle Mountain Brewing. There was an AMAZING guitar playing singer when we arrived, he was the absolute best thing about our visit. We had \"The board\" it was acceptable, the garlic was so raw that it left me with an unhappy tummy for the rest of the night, I'm not sure if it was supposed to be pickled or roasted or what, but it was raw. My daughter had bacon Mac and cheese, she had two bites and was done my food was completely forgettable. Dessert?  Oil saturated donuts and what was truly delicious pair of dipping sauces. 
We didn't drink which we believe to be part of why our review of the food is so different than the rest of yelp."}
{"text":"This place has a large selection of home brewed beers.  I like that the selection is quite broad.  IPA lovers and less hoppy beer lovers are able to imbibe amicably.  

I have only had the \"Rachel\" which is a pastrami sandwich and Oh My Goodness is it good.  The pastrami is smoked in-house and you can taste the smokey flavor.  I will be going back to try more menu items.  The staff is also very, very friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best Ruben sandwiches I have ever had. The meat was juicy, bread crisp, and beer wet. Loved it and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio. Beer was tasty. I had a Caesar salad with sundries tomatoes which was tasty. Hubby had bison burger that he said was very good. Friends had a cheese board with hummus and veggies. All quality. Would definitely go back. Service was good not great I had to ask for water twice but she was pleasant."}
{"text":"It is so nice to have a great place to go.  It is versatile no matter your age.  Families feel comfortable and it is a great place to meet up with 'the gang'.  Food is great and the beer is incredible.  The serving crew works their tails off when the place gets slammed with business.  Definitely a place I put on my 'repeat visit' list!  Military is definitely welcome.  If you are military, let them know."}
{"text":"This place is great! The bacon mac and cheese is amazing, myself and my daughter love the pork chili verde also. We have also tried the jalapeño bombers and pretzel bites which are delicious. They have a great selection of beer too. I really like the 5g I believe that is what it's called. The staff is also very friendly and attentive. I have 0 complaints."}
{"text":"Met up with some co-workers here for an employee appreciation day. I had never been there before that, but I liked it. The environment is casual, the food is great and the drinks were pretty good. I will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best local breweries in AZ, and its right here in Goodyear! The beer is incredible, and they always have at least 8 craft beers on tap, a couple of them changing for seasonal beers. I like the food too, but not as much as the beer. Food is good, but slightly overpriced in my opinion. Haven't had any complaints with service either which is a major plus! Will be back and bring some of my beer drinking buddies with me"}
{"text":"Thank you everyone on yelp for the  recommendation of SMBC.  The food was excellent and the service was great.  
We had the Rachel and the Reuben, best sandwiches we have had in many years.  Will now make it a stopping spot EVERY time we come thru."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now & really enjoy it. The Asian Wings are to die for.  Just sayin'. 
The first time we had the fire burger & they are not lying it's HOT. I'm a wimp now but the hubs isn't & he thought it was hot. Like the hot that is too hot to taste your food hot. Having said that I had great flavor on first bite so if you like it HOT this is for you for sure. 
The onion rings are great. Crispy goodness on the outside & great onion flavor. Holy Yum Bison burger is really good as well as the Triple B. I would eat those on a cheat day & be satisfied with my choices for sure. The beer battered fish was really good too. The tartar sauce was yummy but not a fan of the fries. But in their defense I'm not a fry girl. I'd prefer a really good onion ring instead & here I'm in luck. YAY!
The beers we've tried are all good. Taildragger 643- IPA,  Taildragger - Cream Ale, Strawberry Bitch- Strawberry Blonde Ale but Taildraggers IFR- Oatmeal Stout was my fave so far. 
All around good brewery with good food. It's my new fave on the West Side."}
{"text":"One star is for the decor, effort to have an on-premise brewery, and having cloth napkins.  Unfortunately this establishment needs to really step up to stand out in our community.  I like to support local establishments, yet don't like to feel ripped off at Scottsdale restaurant pricing for less than a TGIFs experience.  This recent visit was not good.

Cleanliness-Walking up to the front door was a dead bird that looks like it had been sitting there for a while at the curb.  Seems like a basic opening checklist would include surveying the exterior for cleanliness and things in their proper working condition.  The patio looked like it needed to be hosed down with spills on the concrete.  Inside the place looked like it could use a dusting...while not heavy on the decor, clean the ceiling fan blades, tables and chairs.  Things felt sticky.  Definitely there was a stale bar stink indicating dirty drains.  The owners and strip mall landlord need to maintain the dumpster area, especially when it's so close to the front.  Extremely disgusting to see the doors to the dumpster open and greasy food waste all over the area leading up to and around the dumpster.  

Food-Way over-priced for the quality!  Little over $50 for couple beers and burgers, then the $2.50 upgrade cost for six greasy onion rings!  The meat on the fiery burger was flavorless.  The buffalo burger was undercooked to our requested liking.  We asked for medium well, and got medium rare.  French fries were also very greasy.  Overall, the food quality didn't sit well, needless to say, meal did repeat itself.  It's been a long time since we've had diner's remorse!

Beer-Prices not listed. If you're going through all the motions to brew local beer, why not showcase it in chilled, clean glasses!!  It's a huge turnoff to drink slightly cold beer in water spotted glasses.  Funny that we ordered two different beers, but both came out tasting the same.  When we inquired about this, we were told it depends on the keg.  You'd think if a customer is expressing displeasure with their beer, why not offer to replace with something else?  Nope, not here.  Overall, the beer was disappointing.

Why not also provide some explanations on your brews?  It's ok, be proud....give a shout out for your creations.  I know not every patron knows all things beer....so why not educate them!  Give a little history about your operation...maybe even offer individual tours of the brewery.  A good place to maybe model after is The Ballast Point Brewery in SD.....you both got all the same qualities, just they got a fun, clean and cool vibe.

Ambiance-it's ok, but it seems a bit off.  Couldn't put finger in it, just seems that people were not enjoying their experience or maybe the place is way too mellow or uptight...don't know.  You'd think that there would have been some sort of daily specials, or anything to promote the whole brewery aspect, but no.  Maybe play some cool background music?  

We've visited your establishment three times this go around....knowing that start-up kinks needed to be worked out.  Now that you've been around for a couple years, there's still some work and marketing needed; don't wait for new competition to come to the area to start stepping up your game.  Perhaps management should not only be visible on the floor, but float around to tables to check on patrons and food product.  Sadly, couldn't tell who was running the show during our visit."}
{"text":"The beer was great.  Make sure to have the bloody mary with their homemade pepper vodka.   So gooood.  The beers on tap and the bar tender are excellent."}
{"text":"Ive wanted to try this place since we moved here but its very busy on fridays and saturday evenings. Now I can see why! great beers! Awesome food and the cocktails are not lacking either. I think they should expand and make a larger location. I'll be back for sure. I sat at the bar and the bar tender was really nice and great sense of humor"}
{"text":"Hit or miss, some tasty beers and some not so amazing (or just not my type of beer). Good news it seems like they are adding more beers to their lists and the set up of the please is great for popping by for a quick beer or having a large group with you.

Yesterday we went and ate for the first time, which is the reason for the lost star, it was like eating at Applebee's nothing mouthwatering or memorable but not absolutely terrible. We got the fish tacos and the queen Ann salad, so maybe we didn't order right? 

We may go back for beers when we see new ones add, the Belgium wheat was tasty!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and my wife and I went excited to have a local brewery in Goodyear. The service was bad and they seemed disorganized. We ordered the nachos and the only way we could describe them is that they looked like diarrhea.  I am not sure if it was actual cheese or not, we could not eat them. Our displeasure was obvious, but our server did not seem to care. The beer and selection was good though. We have not convinced ourselves to give them another try, hopefully things have improved."}
{"text":"I've been here several times early in the afternoon on Friday....the beer variety is goodil...and I've tried a few and really like what I've tried so far...will eventually try all. the green chile stew is awesome...very flavorful..staff is friendly and service is good....if you prefer to relax...afternoon is best....very loud in the evenings....will be back again and again."}
{"text":"An excellent local family owned feel place to grab good food(generous portions) and the brewery is making excellent beer."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon here after hiking with my boyfriend.  I had seen it a few times when driving thru and made a mental note that I wanted to try it out.  

We stopped in on Sunday afternoon and were greeted by the hostess right away.  We ended up sitting at the bar and the bartender Sierra made us feel welcomed right away.  I ordered a Bloody Mary with their house infused pepper vodka, just the right amount of spice.  My boyfriend tried the Hop Snob, an IPA and enjoyed it.  I am not a beer drinker but it was described as the right amount of flavor with hops.  We put in an order for the SMBC Brewers Board, a tasty mix of artisan cheese and meats.  The presentation was done nicely and it was a much larger portion then I was expecting.  I especially enjoyed the Ale Mustard.  My boyfriend also tried the Ray's Gold IPA, which he said was good but the Hop Snob was superior. 

We left with a growler of  Hop Snob and will be back again to try out more dishes on the menu.   Thanks again to Sierra for making us feel right at home amongst the locals!"}
{"text":"Decent beer for the price and really cheap growler fills imo. The beers are very low on the ibu's compared to what I'm used to but the flavors are still there. The food kicked this up to a five star because of how well the food was not only cooked but displayed. They put alot of time and effort into it. I would like to see a double or triple IPA in the future."}
{"text":"Not what I expected, I walked in and joined a friend at the bar.  The bar tender was nice but wasn't really attentive after we ordered a few beers. We then closed out and moved to a table which then took several minutes to be acknowledged. We asked for help and a menu. Just odd since it wasn't busy at all, but eventually we were able to order.  It just seemed as though we didn't even walk in. The pizza came and it was ok. At this point we just wanted to finish and get out! It's a shame because it seems like a nice spot but it just didn't measure up!"}
{"text":"I went to try this place out with a group of my family and friends from out of state since our buddy who lives here raves about this place so much. First don't ask for water since it taste like cramp. Second we ordered our food and tell me why our food was so cold like it's been sitting there for awhile. The jalapeño bomber app that has something stuffed in it got me feeling sick as well.  Maybe it was undercooked?  Who knows. I just know I got home and puked out what I ate. Third we kept asking for utensils to eat our food it took so long we just used our hands! Then 15 mins later they decided to bring out utensils and told us sorry we didn't have any cleaned ones! 4th who serves warm beer?! When we asked for our glass to be super cold with a cold beer in it that's not what we got. Very disappointed with our visit and I won't be returning. The staffs are very nice but they need to communicate with each other."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here on a Friday night and it was a great choice! Neither of us are big beer drinkers so we ended up having their blackberry martinis! And they were delicious!! And we shared the Goodyear pizza!!! Sooo good (leftovers are just as great)) the service was great!! Our server was very attentive, and friendly! There was a little bit of wait but that's to be expected anywhere on s Friday night! It was an overall great experience and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great menu, great drinks, great service and a nice fun atmosphere!! My 2nd favorite brewery in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Just had Mother's Day brunch here.  Food was great.  We have been in a few times now.  Laura is so personable and attentive to customers.  She remembers her customers and it makes you feel really good!  Loved the chorizo eggs Benedict with chipotle hollandaise.  Hubby quiche was yummy too!  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"What a find!  This is a new restaurant and brewery in the west valley. Great craft brews - I truly enjoyed the IPA and the Oatmeal Stout. Such a great atmosphere and there is live music on the weekends. We had the very tasty and very meaty buffalo wings and homemade German style pretzels with spicy mustard. So good!  I highly recommend and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The first review that I wrote was accurate at the time.  However, we decided to give it another chance and we are SO GLAD that we did.  The food, the service, the beer are all 5 stars.  I met with the owner, Laura.  She said that they had computer problems and she did not get my original e-mail.  There are so many great items on the menu--the fish and chips, green chili pork, jambalaya, hamburgers, etc.  The servers are all young but extremely well trained. And the craft beers--as good as it gets.

I am so glad that Laura and her husband opened this place.  We needed a good brewpub in the west valley and this fills the need."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Saddle Mountain. I actually was in doing a vlog review  and the staff was awesome worked with us very well gave us lots of amazing information and we really loved trying the beers! If you would like to see our three part review vlog of Saddle Mountain go to @MedelbergsTravelService on Facebook."}
{"text":"waited 15 minutes for the server to wander over to take order and he got it wrong. then he disappeared again and never came to make sure we were doing okay and we had to nearly trip someone to ask about our order. never again. I will drive further to go to State 48, who has a vastly superior menu"}
{"text":"This is our favorite local hangout... Especially since it's in the same parking lot as our martial arts school. The servers are wonderful and the food is always good. There's always a great selection of beer (duh - it is a brewery) and it's a welcoming atmosphere. We love the free wifi and dig the music. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food is typical bar fare and beer was ok. Not a big craft beer person so that may have been lost on me. Went here last night for dinner and was not impressed.

The problem I had with the place is that they sat me and my wife over on the back wall where it was so dark we could not even read the menus. We had to get up and walk over in front of the window to read the menus (sun was going down so there was not much outside light either). The waitress seen us and said \"I'll light that candle on your table\" yet she never did and that little candle wouldn't have made any difference. The rest of the place was bright and well lit, however, the wall to the left when you walk through the door has NO lights at all.

Not to mention, they sat us near a long table that had probably 15 golf buddies drinking and it was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think let alone talk to one another.

We were hoping the food would make up for the very poor atmosphere but it did not. We'll scratch this place off our list."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place to go, weekday or weekend.  I come here often and I'm always treated well. On this particular occasion Marrisa was our server, she was awesome!  Promt service and took care of our every need, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Great beer great service! This has been a local go to for us since it opened! My favored is the red ale and the strawberry and chicken salad is fantastic! I've not had a single server that wasn't great! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good food and drink, the service was very attentive, live music and we will be going back..."}
{"text":"Our family went here for dinner- ordered the Ruben, Bacon Mac & Cheese, & Turkey Sandwich, had 2 waters & kids juice.
The Ruben was tasty and the Bacon Mac & Cheese was alright. My husband liked his Turkey sandwich too, but wasn't crazy about it.  Giving 3 stars because the food is overpriced, we waited an excessive amount of time for our bill, and then we were charged incorrectly (ours was $40, but we were charged for someone else's $78).  They fixed the incorrect charge & offer a military discount, but we weren't impressed.  Seems like a decent Hoppy Hour though... good luck."}
{"text":"Great little brewery off the beaten path. The hamburgers are delicious, the beer selection is solid, with some great seasonal offerings, & the service is always friendly & competent. The flights are very generous & a great way to try a full gamut of beer.

If you chat up a manager or one of the owners, you might get a tour of the brewing hall, which was a super fun treat."}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt. Service was slow and really bad!! Servers had no idea what they were  doing. A little more training would go a long way in this place. And not burning the pizza would be great!"}
{"text":"We like to come here every once and awhile. The burgers and sandwiches are great, and the wing sauce is unique and delicious. It's like a mix of hot sauce with BBQ, but I don't taste any BBQ. The service is a little hit and miss (slow, but never rude or inattentive), and everyone i friendly. It's a bit pricey, so we don't go as often as we would like, but it is worth the money. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place!!!!!! The servers are AMAZING, Ashley is our favorite! The chicken and GIANT biscuit IS TO DIE FOR! I'm not a beer drinker but my brothers love their beer..... High alcohol content LOL the owner is so friendly!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend with the family. The food was a disappointment and service was mediocre. The beer was also not cold. Will not be coming back here again. Too bad I had high hopes for this place since I live nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I had their spicy burger forgot exactly what it was called but it was very fresh. Server was a bit slow but the food made up for it. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm a beer snob! I've brewed my own beer for years and I know a good beer when I get one and the SMBC Oatmeal Stout is a very good beer! My wife and I both had the stout and we both had the fish and chips. It's the best fish and chips I've had in AZ! Very good! 
Our waitress was knowledgeable about their food and their beer. She recommended the fish and chips and she was right! 
It's nice not to have to drive into Scottsdale for something good to eat!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight. Have hit this brewery after all the games at Goodyear Ballpark this season. Never had a problem before.  Love the $1 beer for a ticket stub. Tonight showed up at 1030 and they were closed. They closed at 10 but there were people inside finishing drinks. I asked the manager why they were closed and he said it was the ONLY night they could clean the bar. Sounds stupid to me. Game is sold out at the ballpark. Going to be a lot of pissed off customers!"}
{"text":"Try the Bacon Mac & Cheese - it is heaven!"}
{"text":"Had the buffalo burger and it was cooked to perfection and it was insanely good. If I am back in Phoenix I'm coming here"}
{"text":"We were excited to find out that there was a brewery over by our side of town. I can't say it was the best, but it wasn't the worst. The decors was pretty neat and we loved how they honored the troops, very important. The beers were ok, nothing special. The food was also so-so. My husband and I both had a burger and it was just a regular bar burger, nothing to write home about. We also shared the Irish eggrolls, that were dry in the inside and didn't have much flavor. The best Irish eggrolls are still from Lumberyard Brewery and the ones from Saddle Mountain just couldn't compare. We will come back for drinks since the bartender was super nice."}
{"text":"Overall We had a great experience at Saddle Mountain, the food was great, nice beer selection and the service was top notch!  I'd have to say the only down side would be the they are a bit on the pricey side! I thought $16.50 for a burger was a bit much. It was a great burger!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience.
First of all, we had a choice between sitting inside with live music that was ridiculously loud or sitting outside on the patio with no fans or misting system in Arizona.
Secondly, their vegetarian menu items are limited to a cheese pizza (which appeared to of come out of a box), or a pretzel.
Next, my Reuben sandwich had approximately half a teaspoon of Russian dressing and absolutely no sauerkraut. When I asked the waitress about this, she checked with the kitchen who informed her that they didn't have any sauerkraut, but they sent it out without it anyway. Not a good decision.
While the beer flight was good, my wife's iced tea had all indications of having come out of some sort of mix.
The final straw was when the lady at the table behind us lit up her cigarette. I challenged the waitress as to whether smoking was allowed and she said it was, despite being in clear violation of Arizona state law.
The bottom line? While I may return for the beer, my wife most likely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Clean place..overpriced food and drink. Takes a long time to get your food so don't be in a hurry to be someplace. Service is a mixed bag. The live music player is too loud. OK experience.. Could have the potential to be great."}
{"text":"We checked it out because we had a coupon, which they didn't honor, said it expired on the 10th. I didn't notice that but could've missed it, however. coupons usually go thru the end of the month, don't they?

The Chile Verde was very good but the menu wasn't too impressive. I was so hoping for something like Four Peaks but they don't come close. The IPA was very good along with some other beers."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, and service is superb. I especially love their bison burger. I can't seem to get beyond that in the menu. We're very new to the area and this was our first restaurant we were introduced to in the West Valley. Kudos."}
{"text":"Although the food, service and atmosphere were all amazing I'm giving them 4 stars for lacking Sunday Ticket. The place just a few doors down was packed because of the availability of The Sunday ticket. This place has a fantastic selection of beer and food. There was 5 adults in our party and we all ordered different things. Everything was superb"}
{"text":"Food is okay/not bad.  Nothing really has stood out.  We've tried burger, mac n cheese, onion rings, pretzel bites.  All decent at best.  Horrible moscow mule, don't think they knew what it was or how to make it.  Beers pretty decent.  Good outside patio when not 1000 degrees.  Had solo guitarist playing.  Not bad but wouldn't have minded the volume a bit lower.  Would probably go back, more than likely happy hour only though."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked in, waited about 20 minutes and then were seated by the hostess.  A few minutes later the manager appeared at our table and very rudely accused us of seating ourselves.  He informed us that there was a waiting list and that it was not ok to just sit down (which we had not done).  After checking with his staff, he found out that we had been waiting and he came and apologized, but it was too late.  We will never go back.  Beyond that, overrated and over priced food."}
{"text":"The worst service ever.  Beers aren't that good!  Rude!  Check bill thoroughly before you leave.  Three times in a row they overcharged me.  Never going there again"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of friends, I tried Saddle Mountain Brewery Company for lunch today. I'm working, so no brew, just food.

Apparently 1130 on a Tuesday is early, because I was the only customer until another 3 tables came in right at noon.

I was greeted immediately at the door by the hostess/server, and had my choice of seating. The place has a nice feel to it. The atmosphere is casual but cool, the tables and chairs are comfortable and sturdy. The bar is nice, and the bartender was busily cleaning and polishing glasses the whole time I was there.

I ordered the Italiano pizza, and an iced tea. Total bill was $18.20, but the pizza was easily two meals. They gave me a pizza box to go at my request. She also offered to give me another iced tea to go, which was a nice touch.

The pizza itself was delicious. It says on the menu that it has \"light tomato sauce,\" and it surely does. For my tastes, I would have liked more sauce than what was there, but hey, it was right there on the menu. There was a lot of cheese, and the other toppings were good and appeared to be fresh. 

Overall I enjoyed my meal, and will go back. Next time I think I might try one of their burgers."}
{"text":"I love this place ! The ambience and the restaurant its self is just great ! Let's start with the food , the nachos with the chile verde are amazing , a good amount of spicy with the jalapeños ! BUT the thing I love the most is the Rachel sliders ! The pastrami meat is to die for ! So tender and delicious ! The small salad that it comes with is so refreshing! I pair this meal with strawberry b*%#! And I'm sold ! For the first time ever , we had room for desert , we had the donuts and once again I am not disappointed , they were so yummy ! And a good amount as well , you get to dipping sauces and fresh strawberries , so good ! Btw management is great !!"}
{"text":"Took my wife out for lunch yesterday and chose this place as we have had great meals in the past.  We were greeted at the door by some kid who said it would be about 5 minutes to wait even though the place was at best half full.  I told him we only have an hour for lunch.  A minute later he told us it was going to be at least a 5 minute wait to allow or waitresses to catch up on their tables.  WTF?  We said why can't we just sit over there (pointing to the open tables)?  He again said we need to let our staff catch up.  We said forget this and left.  My wife goes to lunch 5 times a week and it will be a cd day in Phoenix is before she or any of her numerous clients/residents are told to go there.  Awful treatment and terrible lying don't make for a good host/hostess."}
{"text":"First time here and had a great welcome by the waitress and great service thanks  Chynna! The beer was also great"}
{"text":"Thankfully another craft brewery in the much too dry West Valley.  The beers were pretty good, not stellar but not a waste of time (or cash either) but what I really enjoyed was their smoked pastrami sandwich - very tasty for sure and unique.  Wife really enjoyed her lunch as well."}
{"text":"When I took my date here on a Sunday night I was somewhat skeptical since Goodyear isn't exactly known for their breweries. Pleasantly surprised is an understatement. We both appreciated every aspect of this brewery. The decor was clean, modern and a touch on the industrial side, the staff very polite and helpful, and we both found a beer we loved.  The food was also better than expected.  I would highly recommend taking a tour of the actually brewery as well, the manager on duty was great about answering all of our questions about the brewing process."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in here after watching IT at the Harkins theater. I don't have much to say about the food since we didn't order any. We sat at the bar and I ordered the chasing tail ale which was very good. The bartender was nice as well and the place looked pretty clean. I can't wait to come back and try the food. I will update my review after that."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, apart from the atmosphere/decor, there was not much to like. The service was okay. We were greeted right at the door and were seated immediately. It was pretty lonely and open for a Sunday evening, which was nice. However, after getting us our food and drinks, the waiter was nowhere to be found. 
The food was disappointing. I had the Pork Chili Verde. First off, it was cold. Second, it was a pretty small portion. Lastly, the green salsa was very bland.
My friends burger looked a lot more appealing, but I wanted to try something I had read a review here about. Not worth it. I had a pint of the warhawk? beer. It was okay, but at least the waiter knew what to recommend.
I do not think Ill be returning."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I've hosted a bday dinner here! And paid many other visit, each time better than the last! Great choice of brew and bomb digs food!"}
{"text":"In a word... Awesome!
I only gave 5 stars because I can't give 6.
In town from Portland, OR and this place has a great environment and vibe, wonderful staff and great food and drink.  We had \"The Rachel\" sliders and they were better than advertised.  The IPA beer was on par with some of the best micro-brews in the Pacific NW.
The standing room only on Friday night is a testament to how good this place is.
Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food, the service is terrific and the price is right. Get here early because they fill up fast."}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here every Thursday for happy hour. HIGHLY recommend the nachos, beef dip, triple B, or the quesadilla (with chicken instead). The Show your Stripes beer is so damn good!"}
{"text":"I first stopped in for a beer, it was late and they were wrapping up, but last night my wife and I stopped in after a horrible day. Within a few minutes we were seated. 
It has a very dark and ambient atmosphere with 5 TV on opposite sides of the place (3 on one, 2 on the other.)
Our waitress Kali (spelling?) was amazing. She was chipper and very friendly.
The beer is very good over all and they have some coming for the Christmas season that I am exited to try. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Brought my father and we had a fantastic time! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Showed up with a couple dogs thinking we could sit out on the patio, but apparently there was a large party they were setting up for so it was unavailable. We were still accommodated with our dogs though in a very fast and friendly manner!! Great service"}
{"text":"I'm very happy to have a locally owned restaurant/brewery by my house. Their craft beers are awesome and their food is really good as well. It's such a fun atmosphere. I had my husband's surprise party for his birthday here and one thing they did that was really neat, they named a beer after him for that night. They donated gift cards to a charity event I was helping with. This is just a great place and highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Great choices for drinks...all kinds. 

Think bar  staff could lighten up, smile more not favor regulars perhaps, seemed somewhat arrogant and short.

A nice option for different crafts..."}
{"text":"From the atmosphere and decor to the food and beer, this was a phenomenal find and right in my figurative backyard. Wife and I ordered the pretzel bites for a starter to go with our flight of beer. 4 of the 6 that we tried were definitely worthy of repeating again on a future visit. 

I ordered the triple b burger while the wife had the bacon mac and cheese skillet and neither dish disappointed. As such, we've already identified items on the menu for the next visit."}
{"text":"This place will be on the radar for some time. Great food and great staff. Oh, Da Beer is good too.....hahaha....#illbeBack"}
{"text":"We went for lunch around 1 pm on a Saturday.  The place was not packed however it was fairly full.  We were seated immediately and after waiting for over 15 minutes we say other people who sat down after us approached immediately by a server.  The table next to us was seated after us but had drinks before anyone came up to us.  We ended up leaving without anyone coming up to us.  

Worst service I have seen and years and will not be back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, we normally go to Augies but figured we'd try this place. I was excited when I saw a packed parking lot, and even more excited when I saw there was plenty of seating.  We were given menu's, sat ourselves on the end of a community table and reviewed the menu. After a few minutes we knew what we wanted to drink and eat. After about 10 minutes no waiter had stopped by, we asked someone else at the table if they had been helped, they said \"no\".  We waited a few more minutes and left. When leaving the hostess asked why we were leaving, their excuse was they're new. I'll continue to go to Augies and never give this place another thought. 

This is my first ever review."}
{"text":"They have a delicious Rueben sandwich . The corned beef is made I. House and is excellent. Our waitress was really attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"5 stars on the beer, atmosphere and service. Best bar sign ever.  We only had the Brewers platter. We will definitely go back again!  They did have the brewery behind the glass behind the bar. Seating was spacious"}
{"text":"We go here way to often. I have brought a number of out of towners here and everyone has been happy and asked to go back next trip. You can find things on the menu that are in the 'Eh! OK' category it they have really good food and the beers on tap great. I keep to the club, fish and chips, or the herb chicken sandwich. That herb chicken is a perm a special waiting to go on the menu. ~definitely recommend trying the place."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time and waited 25 minutes to get in which is completely understandable for a Saturday night. It was extremely busy, yet the waitress did everything she could do to make it great! We ordered a hamburger and a turkey sandwich. The hamburger was actually disappointing as it had little to no flavor. The ambiance was great, we had a glass of wine, and the desert was amazing!"}
{"text":"What happened?!?! Your food used to be awesome no matter if you did take out or ate there. This last time I ordered I was so happy that you brought back the chicken and biscuits.  I ordered it for take out and was greeted promptly and the greeter took my order without any problem.  I got home to sit down and eat and was so broken hearted.  The biscuits were burnt, the gravy did not taste like the awesome gravy that it was. Maybe it was the biscuits that changed the greatness of the gravy. The piece of chicken was pretty good but doesn't make up for my disappointment.  I guess that I shouldn't do take out anymore."}
{"text":"Our Sunday place to be. Football, amazing food, and the best Bloody Mary made by the best bartender Celsea. Recommend taking a growler home. 

They care about their customers. It's not a job. It's their passion. Their language. Great beer. Great food. Better company. Thank you. All of you."}
{"text":"Great food and brewery experience! So glad to have a brewery in the West Valley that is so good!! We got a growler to go of our favorite beer!! The food was good as well!"}
{"text":"Best microbrewery on the west side! So happy to have a local microbrewery/restaurant here in Goodyear! This place also has great food and great service. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and was very friendly. The vibe is very hip so we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The bright spot in Phoenix! We are from the northwest where craft beers are on every corner. Thank goodness we found this wonderful place to eat and drink! The food was great and the beer selection was something that we had been searching for. Their west coast ipa was outstanding. Great atmosphere too. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went to saddle mountain brewing for the first time tonight and it was amazing. Had the pretzel bites, jalapeño bombers, and the firehouse burger (I love and can handle spicy food make sure you can before ordering)

The food was awesome, staff was very nice, very pleasant, great atmosphere. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Wow. I paid 10.50$ for two jalapeños cut in half to make a full appetizer. So cheap that the portions are cut that small? I'm sorry that's just terrible and disappointing. 
One of the few brewery's we have in the west side and the portion sizes are so poor I won't be backs"}
{"text":"The best. Great beers and wings ....great service too. Jalapeño poppers are so good. Sliders are really good too"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim last night for Taco Tuesday...but ended up absolutely loving the Hoppy Hour and craft beer!  The patio tables were perfectly relaxing in this nice spring weather.  It was steady and busy.  I don't know how I missed this place when I lived here a year ago.  SMH.

Back home in San Diego, Mira Mesa to be exact, where craft breweries really took off running...I'm used to the super good stuff like Ballast Point.  So, I came here hoping for the best.  It did not disappoint!  I absolutely loved love loved the IFR Nitro (Oatmeal Stout).  We also drank several of the ales (like Hop Snob and Chase the Tail) and loved those just as much.

Their tacos for the Tuesday special are only $3 each.  You can choose from chicken, pork, or beef.  The pork was our favorite because of tasty pineapple salsa, which I usually hate!  The chicken was so so because it was a little dry...but if you ask for extra sriracha ranch, it's good to go!  I didn't have the beef taco, but our friend did and he liked that one the best.  Apparently, they change the toppings for the beef taco from week to week.  

We also had their apple fritter dessert and basically scarfed it down in a matter of minutes...so no going wrong there if you try it!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Saddle Mountain Brewing Company. They had a great Beer list that offered a lot of different varieties that didn't include 80% IPA's. The Food at Saddle Mountain was delicious, everyone was really impressed with their meals in our group. Overall I would definitely return when in this area of Arizona again."}
{"text":"I was even warned that the jalapeño poppers were hot, I guess I just couldn't resist-felt the daring young second childhood kid in me.
Great going down.....but.
Food was great waitress was very very knowable about the menu items and Beer selection."}
{"text":"Oh so yummy grub here. 

Burgers and sandwiches that are OMFG good.

Beers, I got the sampler of 6. They nailed the Saison so I had another pint of it, the Oatmeal Stout was too low gravity (though I understand why) and the freestyle wasn't to my liking, but the others were great examples of Microbrew.

I plan on coming back and having lots more, hell maybe I can share some of my brewing knowledge with their brew folks and stuff like that!

Anyway, yeah, best damn find since I moved to Arizona, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area for White Sox, Reds, Indians, Dodgers, this is an excellent place to stop before or after a spring training game.  Energetic atmosphere.  Pretty crowded on the two times we visited, but we .were seated right away.   The service, food and drinks are all top shelf.  Brewing Company is in the name so really good beers are expected. The definitely deliver the goods with Hop Snob IPA, 346 session ale and the oatmeal stout. That's why we came a second time and enthusiastically recommend the Saddle Mountain Brewing Company."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have been to many micro breweries, and this is one of the best! their beer is great, and when they do a new unique flavor its not so wild that its not enjoyable! The food is really good, I always get their house wings and a bacon bbq burger! have been here several times, never had a bad experience. the staff is awesome and super friendly... my wife and I even got to see the operation in the back when they were preparing to brew a new beer! met one of the owners who really knew her stuff about the process and their beer! if I ever have a bad experience, ill update this review, but I doubt it will ever happen."}
{"text":"This place is great all around, if you get Trevor as a server you are lucky! Recommend bison burger, pastrami sandwich and pretzel bites."}
{"text":"We went two nights in a row.  Yesterdays food and service was good. He had the fish and chips and I had the green chile plate and we were quite happy with everything. 
Todays food and service definitely could have been better, especially considering the place was not nearly as busy.  He had a burger and I got the wings 1/2 hot and 1/2 thai. He was happy with the burger, but my wings were not crispy and they both had a very thick sauce on them - not  good at all. The service was awful once we received our food, but they did take the wings off the bill with a little persuasion. They seemed to socialize with their co-workers too much."}
{"text":"I love the nachos ! The food and  service is always great and it is such a Fun environment to be in."}
{"text":"Best food on the west side in my opinion. Ever appetizer I try is my new favorite! Anyone hung with the \"Russian\" sauce is to die for. I know it's a brewery but I don't even like beer, but I can't stay away because of the food."}
{"text":"2nd visit while staying in Goodyear. Nacho's were a little weird with like a standing water in the bottom of the dish and raw jalapeno's adorned on top. Then got fish and chips and the beer batter was definitely overcooked and hard to eat. They did comp me a beer for the trouble so service was good but this time the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place is legit and a very welcomed edition to the West Valley. The beer selection is superb...thank God they have more than IPAs...I'm a fan of the Chasing Tail Amber and Tuskegee Red Tail. My wife LOVES the Kickin' Rita (Spicy Beer Margarita) and they have a ton of locally crafted beers of all styles to fit your pallette. 
The food is top notch and the Pastrami is the best I've had...rivaling NYC deli shops. If you haven't been here you're missing out"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd visit.  We come every year at this time and we almost didn't return.  Last year we were disappointed by the food and service.  But we really love craft beer so,  we gave Saddle Mountain one more shot.  Glad we did.  New beers, a great new chef and back to great hand made in house pizza."}
{"text":"Another update! Went back last night since we had company in town & had AMAZING service! Lexi was our server & she was the best server we've had there. I hope the service continues to be as good as it was last night!"}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy! We will be back. The beer was great and the \"Rachel\" sliders were delish. They were a version of a Rueben."}
{"text":"The Bloody Marys are amazing. Try the Bison Burger as well, one of the best burgers i've ever had. Really love this place! The atmosphere is very laid back and the servers do a good job."}
{"text":"When I 1st moved to this neighborhood I was really excited about living in walking distance to this place.  I like the theme of the restaurant and it is clean.  However, I don't think their food is very good.  They have hardly any gluten free options and the staff seems unsure of what gf really is.  My family members that are not gf didnt really like their food either.  This place has a lot of potential!  I will check in with them again to see if they have worked on their menu.  I hope they do, because I could see a line at the door. 
update, they have improved their menu and their bl"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome beer! Awesome Place! Awesome staff! I think you get the point. SMBC is just a great place to go to relax and unwind or to go hang out with friends. Their staff and service is super friendly, the prices are perfect, and it's fun."}
{"text":"This pace is the boom. really good food the fire burger is Soooooo good. I will definitely refer this place"}
{"text":"Really good beer and pizza!  If I'm ever back in Goodyear, I will definitely stop in again.  Service ob a Friday nigjt was amazing."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. There's not many breweries on the west side so we were excited to try this place. For starters, it took a very long time to get our food. Our server was great though!!! She genuinely felt bad for the food taking so long. 

We ordered appetizers and the onion rings were good. We ordered chips and salsa as well and the chips were stale. We had to return the order. An hour and fifteen minutes later, we got our food. There was a couple things on our tab.  The bison burger was ok... didn't care for the fries. The philly cheese steak was good. The wings were cold and the pizza was mediocre. 

Overall, we would probably go to native New Yorker instead."}
{"text":"Just okay. Prices too high for Goodyear. This is not Scottsdale. We had a decent salad with way too many croutons, and an okay burger. As I don't want to spend my money on just okay, I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and have always been impressed with the different beers I have tried. I haven't tried their whole selection, as I generally stick with the kinds I prefer, but have never been disappointed. The food was exceptional as well. I have had a few different servers, and one of them was disappointing, but overall good service. This is a great family-friendly restaurant with an exceptional beer selection. I will continue to come here and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Food is always great and the beer is wonderful! The servers could use a little customer service training  but otherwise we Love saddle mountain!"}
{"text":"Place was great, Manager was awesome and made up for the invisible waitress. More importantly the food was delicious, definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about trying new places, but I was really amazed with this establishment. I had heard good things, and finally had a chance to try it out. I must say I was satisfied with, the drinks, food and more importantly how I was treated by the staff. Very friendly and informative. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Friendly guy sat me.....Ordered a flight and a lunch wrap....  The wrap was good.  Would order it again if I'm back.  I only say if, because I live in the East Valley, was heading out of state, so this would be a 3 hour round trip drive.
I ordered the flight....she said they had a new beer, so pick a beer from the list to have replaced with it....I appreciated the fact that I got to pick the unwanted beer, rather than them!  Here's where the review fumbles....as I said, I was headed out of state....very much could have been on my lunch from work, with the time I was there....Sat at the table, with my meal and flight pushed across the table from me....I think this is international sign for \"check please\"....for nearly 20 minutes before she came to \"check\" on me, at which point I said \"just a box please and here's my card\".  I was a little bummed at the inattentiveness.....however, I will give her this, she was the only server working, and I was one of four tables....one newer than I, but unfortunately getting better attention than I.  Sorry, I factor all of this when \"calculating\" my yelp...a form of synergy...So I would probably go back....sit at the bar....where your \"server\" is pretty much \"right there\"...."}
{"text":"This is the best oastrami! Try the Rachael! Brined pastrami then smoked. In a pretzel. Bun with delicious coleslaw. I've been coming here every time I visit Phoenix and they have never let me down. Everything on the menu is delicious you can't go wrong! Service is top notch. This is owned by folks who love to brew deliciously good beer and serve amazing food! You won't regret coming here only only not coming here sooner! Great job Saddleback!! Your awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm in from LA and I like to try local craft beers when I'm in a new place and when I found this place is couldn't wait to give it a try but, unfortunately it never happened. 
I walked in at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed which was a good sign. I walked over to the bar area which is really small for a BREWERY. there was 2 of us so we were waiting for a couple of seats to open which I figured would be soon since there was a woman sitting at the bar with her 2 year old toddler (which I'm sure is highly illegal) waiting to get her growler filled. we waited 15 minutes for this woman and toddler to to move but since it was taking forever for 1 of the 3 bartenders to start filling her growler I finally got frustrated and irritated by not being able to sit because they clearly would rather have the 2 year old at the bar than a couple of paying customers, so I left.
hopefully toddlers sitting at the the bar isn't a common practice or this place may not be around much longer. I can't recommend this place just due to the fact that I never got to try anything due to the staffs lack of attention to detail"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has 4+ stars. It doesn't make logical sense. The hummus on the \"Mediterranean\" board is over spiced with garlic and some sort of vinegar/olive juice or brine which is not how classic hummus is prepared. The olives were hot for some reason, another mystery. I'm not sure the menu creator has ever been inside a true Greek or Mediterranean establishment as this is a poor representation of their culture. We sent it back and had calamari instead. You can't go wrong with fried food as it is inherently easy to cook. They were obviously the kind that were precooked and frozen however so that was slightly unappealing as well.

We ordered the strawberry fields chicken salad and the \"Rachael\" sandwich for lunch. The dressing for the salad tasted like strawberry milk and should have been more of a true vinaigrette than a cream sauce. The chicken was over seasoned with most of the seasoning burnt and charred to the breast with a slight chemical taste. Not sure what that is about as salads are also hard to mess up.

The \"Rachael\" pastrami sandwich was good, not great. Fairly greasy but it is pastrami so that could be expected. The meat is brined in house for 21 days or more which adds to the flavor and overall appeal.

The beers were great, though and probably the only saving grace. 

If you have never visited an alehouse, brewery, or pub, don't open one and expect people to flock to it. For example places like Ohso, four peaks and  san tan are leading examples of what your standard brewery/restaurant should be like, and this establishment simply is not up to par."}
{"text":"I really had no clue there was a full fledged brewery restaurant on the edge of civilization.

You will find the standard brewery food, I had the fish and chips, I really enjoyed the shoestring seasoned fries. My beer was good too and it was made great due to the daily special it was on.

They had some loud live music, maybe it is my age speaking but why must live music be so loud?"}
{"text":"My first time here and not disappointed. I live in Tempe, but my boyfriend lives in Goodyear; looking for a place to celebrate near him, I found Saddle Mountain on Yelp. Celsea, our waitress was phenomenal. We didn't have to wait to order  (if anything we were talking so much we kept forgetting to look at the menu).

I had the smoked turkey avocado. From first bite to last, each mouthful I could taste the avo, smoked applewood bacon, aoli, and turkey. The bread was toasted, yet soft. I ordered the onion rings instead of fries, and they were great.

I didn't eat the 2nd half of my sandwich so we could partake in the drunken brownie  (warmed chocolate brownie, caramel, vanilla ice cream with caramel drizzeled on top). After eating only half, this big girl was full.

I can't wait to eat the other half of my sandwich tonight  :)

I will definitely become a frequent customer if this is how it always is."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Love that it's all about local. The beer was very good and the burger was amazing. Friend had the Ruben and said it was outstanding. Their fries are thin and crisp.  Get a side of the beer cheese - worth every calorie!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome microbrewery on the westside! Friendly staff, excellent customer service. Had the flight and the brew was phenomenal! Thank you Memo conversing with us!"}
{"text":"To be honest, the two stars are for the decor of the brewery and restaurant. Our experience there was fairly awful. We went on a Sunday around 5:30. It was very busy and we had to wait for a table, which was fine. They told us 15 and it ended up being closer to 30-35 minutes. We grabbed a beer at the bar and walked around until they had a table available. Once we finally got a table (one that had been empty for at least 15 minutes before they cleaned it) it took at least 15 minutes, maybe more, before anyone came to the table. We were about to get up and leave. The experience I've described so far is basically how the rest of our meal went. We saw our server a handful of times, the food was okay, and the beer was subpar. We had a two flights and tried every single one of their beers and were unfortunately none wowed us. A lot of them were pretty good, but just had no wow factor. 

We make a point to try any new brewery we come across and this one was just very disappointing. They get points for the decor, cleanliness, and nice staff, but they have a lot they need to work on! We do not live close, so it is very unlikely we will ever give this place another try."}
{"text":"had a great time here the other day. The food seemed well thought out and most if not all items made from scratch which is so nice in a sea of crappy chains. fish and chips, turkey sandwich, pork sandwich and Chili Verde. All were great, and good portions. Chili verde could have had more tomatillo/chili flavor but overall wonderful. Thanks for a gem in the sand."}
{"text":"First, off it's great having a brewery and eatery on the west side of Phoenix, so thanks for that.  I had the hamburger here and it was good for lunch, a larger portion.  A little pricey for lunch but it was quite and nice inside the restaurant, and the waitress was nice.  I'm regretting not having tasted the brews now, but I'll be back to taste those."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Amazing food! Amazing beer! Definitely worth it to order the flight with 6 beers to taste! My boyfriend order the opposite 6 so we got to taste all the beers! I loved all but one.. was just not my thing. Waitress was super helpful because it was our first time there. Would recommend and would go again!"}
{"text":"Had just finished the sentence \"There aren't any cool places to eat in this town\" when I opened up yelp to find a brewery had opened 2 miles from home! How did we miss this?! Drove up and could hear the live country music from the parking lot. Win win win. Great food, great beer & friendly staff. Super cool design, super clean and we even took a quick tour of the brewery. Great time and 5 stars from us both. Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer. I had the turkey avocado bacon sandwich with fries. Crispy fries. Fresh turkey. Yum. With a Hob Snob West Coast IPA.  Highly recommended. They also have pastrami sandwiches brined for 30 days. Yum."}
{"text":"This is one of our regular places to visit. Always friendly - a happy chatty place. Spouse got the Sangria and gives it 5 stars - the best outside Rocking M Ranch in Illinois. Started with an awesome Bruschetta - the balsamic vinegar was a treat. Fish tacos and Fish n Chips for main course - both very good which is as expected.  Located just off the I-10 in Goodyear,AZ on Estrella Parkway easy to find and a must dine here experience."}
{"text":"The West Valley so needed a place like this!  Why did it have to happen after I quit drinking?

So I can't vouch for the beers (although from the sign on the wall, the IPA only has a disappointing 5.9% ABV).  

The industrial/vintage aircraft decor is nice.  I was here for a lunch appointment and we each had wraps; I, the Thai chicken and my guest the Buffalo chicken.  Both were very good and so were the fries they came with.  

I'll go back and would encourage you to try it also.  Not only do we need places like this in the West Valley, we also need to patronize them when they do open they stay open and their successes bread more."}
{"text":"Well.....all the staff were super friendly and nice to an over tired Alley pup. We interacted with 3 team members and they were all 5 star worthy. Nick met us at the door and made sure we were seated comfortably.  He made excellent conversation and made us feel welcome.  A keeper for sure.  Steve was our waiter and he again deserves 5 stars, friendly, warm and great conversation.  Give the man a raise & promote Nick! Bryan the manager on duty gets 6 stars.  This place is off the charts for friendliness and customer services.  Their kindness alone made the drive worth it. 

Alley loved the awesome service and the great treatment she received. Excellent staff for a larger brewery.  

Now into the beer....we didn't try the food, just the beer.  The beer didn't really stand out.  It wasn't horrible but we didn't feel the need to take a growler home.  The IPAs were ok.  We got a flight of 6.  The alcohol was lower than expected for all types of beer.  After speaking with Bryan, we learned this was on purpose.  The master brewer wanted people to be able to have a few before being totally wasted.  That is definitely a positive.   

Next time we are in the area will make sure to bring our appetite because their food looks top notch.  They have a winter beer we WILL be back for."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but this was such a horrid experiance. They were not very busy at 4 pm and we were quickly seated but waited so long for a server that we had to ask if we were going to get one. Finally we're able to order...the server appeared annoyed with us. Pretzel bites were amazing. I think there was some confusion about our wings....no.idea what kind of sauce they had on there but we didn't complain because they never actually asked what we wanted. We ordered burgers medium well and they came out medium to medium rare. We attempted to complain and the server actually argued with us that since the ticket said medium well that is what they were. She then told us we should have ordered them well done before asking with anattitude and apparently permanent bleep face if we wanted her to take them back. I declined but another in my party refused to eat it and asked for a refund. Per one guest the bathrooms are nasty. The manager did come out and offer a replacement meal to the guest who returned their burger. I was in town visiting and we were hoping for a nice meal so my suggestion is this is definitely NOT the place to find that....Oh and I also forgot the extremely creepy email I received after dining there....I did not pay for the meal or provide my email address or share my name and somehow they obtained my email address and thanked me for visiting....nothing like stalking people....ugh"}
{"text":"Good beer , good food. New place so service is slightly slow, but that's normal. Get a flight of beer try them all and enjoy what they have to offer. Got a coupon in the clipper to come out and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"In honor of Memorial Day weekend, I've chosen a patriotic establishment to review. I referenced Saddle Mountain Brewing Co. in my review of the Goodyear Ballpark because they serve Tail Dragger beers on draft. But this brewery offers more than a great selection of beers brewed on site.

Saddle Mountain Brewing is themed, from the names of the beers, to the menu and the decor, to honor the military. Flags were being hung outside while we waited to order. It's mostly centered on aircraft, so clearly, they are trying to make a connection with Luke Air Force Base. Regardless, it's a cool place to hang out for a few beers, but this place has a kitchen that could stand on its own.

Having been here several times before, I have noticed that the menu continues to evolve. The Jalapeño Bombers are my favorite appetizer. On other visits, I've enjoyed everything from pasta to gumbo. Today, it was time for a good old burger. The Triple B, with BBQ sauce and onion rings was cooked perfectly. And I enjoyed (my favorite) Tuskegee Red Tail and a Warhawk  with my meal. The food and the beers have never disappointed!

There are a lot of breweries popping up all around Arizona. This one has been around for a while. It reminds me of Four Peaks in a way, because that was the first brewery where I enjoyed something more substantial than the typical bar fare (and the beers are that good). Because Saddle Mountain continues to offer a great selection and rotation of beers paired with an excellent kitchen, they deserve an even stronger following. Keep up the good work, and God Bless America!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Tried it out as its close to us in Goodyear.   We'll probably return at some point but honestly it's nothing fancy.  Goodyear is lacking!!!"}
{"text":"If you go to one of the games, show your ticket stub to get $1 beer! Really great food and great service! The hop snob is amazing if you love IPA's"}
{"text":"Excellent smoked pastrami and I don't even like pastrami!! Great choice of brews, burgers are very good and service was outstanding.. we have only been once but will be going more often for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice place cute in a little strip mall near the 10.  Husband had the Ruben and I had the French dip.  Both were very good.  Service was excellent and food came out quickly.  This one's a keeper on our list."}
{"text":"DELISH!!!! We love coming here, my husband loves the beer and I love the food. The atmosphere is always awesome and it's perfect for  date night or a night out with the family!"}
{"text":"Outstanding brews and great food selection."}
{"text":"Selection of beer was minimal as they were changing staff and had a new guy brewing. I ended up drinking someone else's bet and traded them mine. Sounded good but wasn't. The food on the other hand was amazing. Definitely the best bar food at a brewery, hands down. Might be back once the beers are up and running!"}
{"text":"delicious!!!  cant wait to go for happy hour.  The food is great and the open area dining make it feel very roomy.  You have to try the flight of beers, a great selection and great way to taste them all"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. My husband & i came for mothers day brunch. Great food. Having a complimentary mimosa. Will come back & tell my friends."}
{"text":"Love this brewery great beer and best pizza I ordered a margarita with extra basil... Food is yummy and table service is excellent... Very busy place so expect to wait but worth it... However I'm still waiting for them to put grilled salmon sandwiches on the menu"}
{"text":"We first went to his brewery on my birthday and have been going since they opened!  Everything is wonderful from the drinks, food and the best Rice Krispie desert!! Wait staff is also super nice!

Since we moved to the East Valley, we wish there was another location over here:)! Come to Ahwatukee please :)!!"}
{"text":"So much more than just your neighborhood Pub

Saddle Mountain Brewing Company is a pleasant alternative to the everday sports bar you will find all over the valley. Sure, Saddle Mountain offers the same typical bar food like most sports bars, but Saddle Mountain has a much more relaxed atmosphere, and that's a challenge to find in your local sports bars. 

In addition, to the great atmosphere, Saddle Mountain offers really good food and the service is good. Would I consider Saddle Mountain to be a four-star restaurant? No. However, they do serve a pretty good corned beef and pastrami.  Just the proper ratio of meat to kraut and cheese; served on a good sized marbled rye bread.

The beer selection is great.  I would recommend getting a flight of beer so you can sample.  The prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly. Not a bad way to spend time with friends and family."}
{"text":"The worst service ever.  The beer is eh? They are very rude (employees). Never visiting again!  Zero Vegan options was also disappointing"}
{"text":"Awful service !! Took forever for just drinks
And it wasn't that busy food was ok on a side note I think it is a very well designed place."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I'm so glad this is in Goodyear!! If you're looking for something nice and good you should probably eat here."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, the beer was decent, but the food and the service were horrible. Over the past few weeks, I had heard that the menu had changed and the food was better. So we decided to give it another chance. 

We went to dinner there last night, and as was expected for a Friday night, there was a long wait. No big deal, as we anticipated that. I told the hostess that there were five adults and we needed two highchairs for toddlers, thereby making us a party of seven. For whatever reason, they decided to seat us at a table for four. My wife told the hostess that we were a party of seven and that the table for four would not meet our needs. My wife also pointed out that there was a table next to us that was empty and that we should merge the tables into one to give us more room. The hostess proceeded to tell my wife that the table in question was reserved for someone on the waiting list already. My wife then asked the hostess to find us a table that would accommodate our group. The hostess told my wife that if we wanted a bigger table we would have to wait an additional 30 to 45 minutes. At this point we resigned ourselves the small table because we were hungry and the toddlers were getting restless. 

Once we were all crammed into the small table, the waitress came by and took our drink order. She then returned with our drinks and took our food order. She then return with her food and we never saw her again until the bill came. We never got refills for our drinks and we were never asked if everything was OK. 

Needless to say that the service continues to be horrible. If you go there, go with the understanding that the beer is decent and the food is good, but you will not get good service."}
{"text":"Great place for some home brewed brew. The homemade pastrami sandwich is a must try. You might have to wait on the weekends for a seat."}
{"text":"Went on a wednesday around 8pm and the place was busy. The hostess took a long time to seat us although there were three tables available to seat two, the two parties of 3 and 4 had to wait for tables to become available/to be cleaned.

Once seated, it took another 15 minutes to order. I had the Herb Chicken - it was good but I would not order it again. The pomegranate Mojito was awesome, but strong. I did not have any beer. (I know! At a BREWERY! I will next time :) )
I liked the food and the look/atmosphere there, but the service needs help. It is just way too slow.  

Our server said that it is pretty busy all the time, even during the week, but on weekends wait times are extra long (who knows what that even means - I'd recommend - make reservations :) )"}
{"text":"Great service, yummy food and beers, and they appreciate their military! First beer on them AND a 10% discount! Oorah!"}
{"text":"After hiking to Quartz Peak at the Estrella Mountains on Sunday, we were famished. This brewery was like an oasis in the middle of the desert for us (or actually more conveniently placed close to the I-10 and Estrella Parkway) more or less. 

Great service, cool ambiance, and delish food are a triple threat! I couldn't decide on a single beer so I decided to order a beer flight so I had my choosing of 6 of their beers. I really liked the oatmeal stout as well as the Warhawk. Ray's IPA was hoppy and had a bit of a kick to it. 

The Triple B Burger was excellent. When I return,
I will order that again because I'm a sucker for burgers with BBQ sauce, bacon and fried crispy onions. The beef itself though was dense and full of flavor. The only thing that could've been even more perfect is if I could've topped it all with a fried egg. (But I guess that wouldn't be a triple B then). 

Our group ordered the pretzels appetizer but I think our waitress forgot to include it, which worked out since we were so full from our entrees anyway that it would've been impossible to eat it all but I am curious about trying it next time."}
{"text":"Excellent little brewery. Had the Chasing Tail Amber Ale and Tuskegee Red Tail Red Ale. Both very good. A must try if you are going to Goodyear Stadium to see the Cleveland Indians or Cincinnati Reds. Reuben was very good"}
{"text":"Great place! Beer is awesome and food is amazing!! Celsea is an amazing bartender and knows her beer! Memo was very helpful and we look forward to offering their taps at our tap house, House of Hops Kingman!"}
{"text":"Drove out to Goodyear from Gilbert to visit some friends and popped in for dinner, based on the Yelp reviews- so this was our first visit. The place was pretty busy (Sunday around 6:30pm) but we were sat right away. Waited for an unusually long time to see a waitress, maybe 10-15 minutes, but she apologized right away for the wait. It's a smaller place, the decor and atmosphere was exactly our speed. Micro brewery, nicely decorated with aviation memorabilia, tv's around for something to look at. I tried two beers, the cream ale and the honey ale, both were tasty. BUT...if you like a really cold beer, like I do, you might be disappointed. I think the beer was served at a more typical 40-45 degrees, no frosty glasses. It was tasty, for sure, but my personal preference is close to freezing. My wife and I both had burgers. They were pretty good, but not great. We both found the meat a little too thick, tough to open your mouth wide enough to bite, and the buns were a little dry. Onion rings were very good. All in all, not bad at all. If we're in the area again, we'd give it another go. Maybe try one of the pizzas?"}
{"text":"The place is decent but uninspiring. The server Chelsea is attentive and engaged. The nachos were promised with real cheese and weirdly came with a little real cheese buried underneath some kind of cheese whiz. Would not recommend.
Having a pint of the Edge Pale Ale after trying a flight of their beers. Beers are decent, worth the visit.
Sadly, there are people at the bar who really bring down the experience.
While I doubt I'll come back, if I do next time I'll sit somewhere further from the drunks.
Not was a nice touch that Chelsea recognized the issues and apologized, I'd hate to be a server in a bar!!!"}
{"text":"I am happy to say an update to my review on this local brewery is in order. I am so glad I have given them several more chances. 

Improvements from my last review:
--the tap water is now delicious. I would think they started using their filtered water which I know they had for their beer. (I know, I know, beer is more important than water..lol. But one has to hydrate everyone in a while to enable another delicious beer) 
--fries were delicious. They no longer taste like fish. Yay!!

New Notes; Pros:
--bison burger is AWESOME...you must try. 
--Beer has even made improvements from opening. When  they first opened their beer leaned heavy on the hoppy side. Now they have a more balanced selection and have even started listing the IBUs (International Bitter Units). I love this. They have a beer with IBU of 18 and MAN...doe that pair nicely with that bison burger.  
--service has been great and the whole place seems to be firing on all cylinders. 

Cons:
--hmmm, I must say I don't really have any particulars. I look forward to seeing and tasting the continued progression of this coolly vibed local brewery."}
{"text":"I came in just to try it out. Even tho they only carry their own brewed beer, beer selction is awesone. Food wise...havent had a bad experience. Granted ive only been here 3 times. Try it out and judge yourselfs."}
{"text":"Fun place good beer staff was great the vibe is cool clean . I ordered a flight and like most of the beers a large selection of their own craft beer and a great menu"}
{"text":"Was here today for happy hour!  The service was great and quick.  The beer I tried was good. We had the pretzel bites and they honestly were pretty horrible.  They were dry and luke warm at most.  The cheese dip they came with was good though.  We also has chips and salsa and that was not much to write home about. I will come back but hopefully can be more impressed with the food."}
{"text":"We just finished our 3rd meal at SMBC. I upgraded my score to 5 stars because the food and service have been consistent with each visit. At this point we (hubby, my parents and myself) have ordered 8 items from the menu and all 8 were delicious.

Tonight hubby had Thai chicken wings and I had the 3B burger (beef, bacon and barbecue). I think we will try the pizza the next time, it looked delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I highly recommend the nachos and the pastrami sliders they're so delicious! The service is good too!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. The Irish Eggrolls is a must here. One of the best places to go."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the establishment seemed clean, and the beer was cold.
I like the casual and family friendly vibe of the place, to note it was Friday approximately happy hour and relatively busy.
Again, our waitstaff was fantastic. However I was a little unnerved about another patron sitting on the porch with a large pit bull, which patrons had to walk around to get to their tables.
I have several pets, and would consider myself an animal lover. That being said, I don't necessarily want someone else's dog sitting next to my table as I try and eat a meal. As such I did not order anything to eat this time.  
I hope to try again, but have nothing but positive things to say about the establishment just wondering why animals would be allowed in such a small and confined space."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great Service 
Seated Quickly
Smells delicious when you walk in 
Friendly People
Casual
Nice environment

Cons:
Loud
Food was bland and uneventful 

Overall, nice place to hangout in. Did not have alcoholic beverages so have no say in that. Had high expectations for food and presentation was good however food tasted very plain. Meat was undercooked. Tried the apple crumb dessert and did not hold up to expectation, had lots of spices. Pizza dough felt undercooked. Tried his place out due to high reviews but was disappointed.

What we ordered:
Beef dip
Chicken and biscuit 
Margarita Pizza
Clam Chowder
Apple Crisp"}
{"text":"The best Rueben I've ever had and my husband said the dish and chips was better than what we had last week at San Clemente pier. Our waitress (Heathermeagan) was amazing and I recommend her highly! Trent does a good job in the kitchen too!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff brew really great tasting beer paired with good food. Plenty of seating and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Sadie it's Patio Time....and Growler refill is $14.14....Great Deal! On the Patio and the Best Bartender....Cierra just brought me a fresh cold Brewski. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant manager, Panda, greeted us warmly. Beers are excellent, food menu is diverse and easy to navigate. We were very happy to find a quality local restaurant in Goodyear, and regret not stopping in our first night. Spring training special: bring in your ticket stub the day of the game, and your first pint is $1."}
{"text":"We came across this place accidentally, and we are so happy we did! The beer brewed here is to die for, and the food complements it perfectly. This has quickly become our favorite date night spot."}
{"text":"We love this local spot in Goodyear. It's absolutely our favorite, we go at least once a week. Best food in Goodyear by far. Awesome setting, fun atmosphere, and amazing service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great brewery and and food! Loved the beer, Thai chili wings, and Goodyear pizza. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and I Love their Mac & Cheese, but what it really comes down to is their beerski's. Great brew selection and they're always crowd pleasers. Love the seasonals, they're always a hit. Looks like it's time to expand, gets a little crowded, but a fav go too."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! First time stopping by, and will definitely be back. I had the chicken sandwich don't remember the name but it had chicken, cucumber, tomato, lettuce, pesto aioli and alfalfa sprouts. The best part of this sandwich was definitely the soft focaccia herb bread! I had some fries which were delicious! 
My husband had the Three B's burger. I had a bite of that and it was too, very flavorful! Didn't read what it had but it was delicious! 
We also ordered some mini corn dogs for our toddler and of course I had to try them; these were super fresh and also scrumptious! He ate them all including the carrots. 
Service was excellent! They were nice enough to let us bring our baby's stroller, as long as it wasn't on the way. (Which we decided to leave Red Robbin because of this!) Didn't get to try their beer but will definitely be back for a mommy and daddy date! 

Two thumbs up for Saddle Mountain Brewing Company and of course they deserve five stars!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me 7 years of living in Goodyear to find this place. I feel cheated in a way. 

To begin with, the service is great. Everyone pitches in, and as a former waitress I love seeing that!

The food was served promptly and everything was fresh. Afterwards, my dad proclaimed his bison burger was the best burger he's had in a long time. Mind you we are from California, so our standards are high. They even cooked the burger exactly how he asked for it (rare), which is so hard to find usually.

My one and only complaint is they don't have turkey burgers. But that's just because I love them and I think they'd make a killer one.

We will definitely be going here more regularly."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, I have been here a few times and have not been disappointed. I only wish the actual restaurant was a little bigger because there are so many people crammed in to a small area, you cannot enjoy a conversation with your table without yelling. Perfect place to eat, drink a couple beers and then leave so you can actually enjoy your company!"}
{"text":"The beers were great! My husband had the fire burger which was so spicy but good! Be prepared for high level of spicy (he does spicy challenges and admitted this was moderately spicy for him). I had the bison burger. The burgers were good but disappointed such a high quality burger was alongside some low quality French fries. You would expect hand cut fries with this dish. They seemed to be bagged and frozen which is ok but a mismatch for the quality."}
{"text":"Me and my girl wanted to try something new so we came here. Food and drinks are good. Service was normal and the environment was good. Over all happy. I had the Triple B burger"}
{"text":"A great place for a good brew, I had the the Thai wings and I must say these are some of the best I've had. Great staff as well super clean."}
{"text":"The service is good but I expected more out of this place. We had a turkey club and onion rings and it wasn't that great. The onion rings were too greasy and over cooked. The sandwich I already forgot what It tasted like. We asked for a side of ranch and they charged is for it. We laughed at that. We also had the calamari appetizer. Not only was the portion extremely small but very greasy. It seemed they took them out of a bag frozen and dumped in the frier. They had no flavor. The well drinks were ok.For the price we paid it wasn't worth it. We won't be going back. I believe if you are going to have those prices on food you need to have way better food."}
{"text":"This is such a Wonderful place for The Two  Amazing We  
Enjoy Everything And May I Mention Chad Our extremely Professional and Knowledgeably Waiter  Totally Awesome 
The food we ordered was French dip sandwich but we shared Totally meeting Our Expectations Onion Rings OMG Crunchy delicious & The Brew Was Extremely Definitely Delicious Dont Miss Out You Will Not Regret What A Spectacular Place Cheers"}
{"text":"Went with some friends on a Thursday night. They were very busy but the wait staff was hustling. Good burgers and hand crafted beer.  The motif is post WWll. 
It was a nice find."}
{"text":"Have been back a few times to give this place another shot since it's one of the only breweries on this side of town. I had the jambalaya which was perfectly seasoned. Also tried the jalapeño poppers and they were awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good! We sat at the bar and the server was very polite and helpful. Bring our first time they let us sample some of the beers which I liked. I am a bit picky when it comes to beer so it was nice not sampling with a 20 oz.  I had the fish and chips, yum. My tarter sauce was so good I dipped everything in it. I am excited to go back and try more of everything. And I really liked the design. Husband said the mac and cheese and burgers are great. My friend had the green chilli skillet and just wow!"}
{"text":"Great beer unfortunately for this local establishment that is where it ends. I tried their thai pizza twice first time was okay second time the sauce tasted like it has turned. I also wish this restaurant would offer a vegetarian/vegan patty like most other bars who serve burgers. My husband got the burger while he ate it was not worth coming back .The worst part about this experience was we were told we could not sit out on the patio. It was a beautiful day and they had plenty of staff."}
{"text":"This is a very good brewery with fresh food to match. The service is friendly, professional and they can always recommend a great beer to match your food. I am picky when it comes to IPAs but this brewery has the best IPAs I have had. They have cool music playing and a relaxing atmosphere. Wish there were more places like this on this side of town."}
{"text":"It is a small place if you have more than 4 dining.  You will need to wait!  We had 6 of us.  It was about 45mins to wait.  We figure we will chit chat and wait the bar area.  It is small at the bar area.  We were finally seated, it took a little to get our drink and food order.  They were packed and busy.  We ordered the board (cheeses, breads, humus, etc.).  It was very good.  I ordered the beef dip with french fries.  It was very good.  Very flavorful and good crispy fries.  Small con was getting the server's attention for a refill."}
{"text":"Three of my husband's favorite things... beer, airplanes and great food. We tried this place on a Thursday night and it was moderately busy. We were seated right away and the service and food were outstanding. The nachos are a must. We got a 6 glass sampler of different beers and we liked them all. My favorite was the 5G pull and my husbands was the Imperial Red."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they build this place in the Westside! ! All good breweries are in East valley, too long of a drive when u live in the weezy...but here is perfect!  Good food, beer, service and music ! Will most definitely go back there again.  Very family oriented too!"}
{"text":"This is a great local place for local beers. Fun spout appetizers and homemade food. Lots of tvs and a full bar. The heated olives are awesome on the app of cheese plate."}
{"text":"Great comfort food and beer. Great pretzel bites, mac n cheese and this dish that was breaded chicken, andouille sausage, white gravy two biscuits. Spicy good."}
{"text":"About as good as it gets for the west side. Great Menu. Pretzels are meh... Brews are solid though."}
{"text":"Great little place, nice staff, I think the sandwiches are best, Wednesday thing, this will have some people going elsewhere, people love a daily happy hour! Nice place to go to once in a while though."}
{"text":"Meat, cheese, a chaser and a salted rim? Outside of the Midwest? How can this be real? When it comes to good Bloodies, we don't ask questions, we just drink! Their B-17 Bloody Mary was fantastic, as was the sidecar of their own beer. We also had a delicious burger. Next time we're in Goodyear, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful, beer is delicious, atmosphere is pleasant. The service however can be rather hit or miss, and unfortunately it seems that when we bring out of town guests we happen to get less than impressive service, coincidence of course. Menu items offer great variety, and the beer is great - especially when you get to take it home in a growler!"}
{"text":"We never find ourselves this far west, so when we did, we made sure to make a stop at Saddle Mountain.  My hubby and I ordered the pretzels with mustard and beer cheese as our appetizer.  The pretzels were very bready and not pretzel-like at all.  The mustard tasted like they made it themselves.  The bartender said she loved the cheese the most, but we loved the mustard much better.  We also ordered the buffalo burger.  It was great of them to split the order and put it on two different plates so it was easier for us to share.  It wasn't great when I bit down on a 1\" piece of toothpick that was in my burger.  It looked like it was a part of a toothpick they use to keep the burger together, but the one in my burger was intact, so who knows how it got in there.  

My hubby and I both chose our own beers for our flights.  He chose all the hoppy beers and I chose the more malty beers.  I loved the amber ale and he loved the IPA's."}
{"text":"I've been here 1 time. The environment is fun, family friendly (on a Sunday afternoon) and casual. The food was awesome! I had a burger and loved it - definitely recommend it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I didn't drink but I saw a good selection of their beer and a beer sampler that looked interesting. I will try this place again on a weekend evening and I'm sure it will be fun."}
{"text":"Went in for a second visit, food was ok but a little overpriced. Service wasn't great, overheard employee badmouthing the place to another employee. Descent beer selection. Server didn't know much about the beers. If they can work out the kinks this could be a cool little place."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. I love their Crafts & Brew nights. (I made a really cool sign for my firepit - gotten lots of compliments on it) So, atmosphere is fun and can be loud. We've joked with other patrons at other tables.  Fun place to spend a couple hours or pop in for appetizers and/or a drink.

The food is good quality pub fare.  We've had the beef sliders, chicken wings, SMBC hamburger, french fries and thai pizza.  

My most recent visit, I had a terrific server (unusual spelling, but can't recall her name) Our server was very observant of when we might need something. Once, I raised my hand, very briefly, and she caught the movement (from the corner of her eye as she was heading the other direction) and turned right around to come back.  I was shocked she noticed!"}
{"text":"Just bought a house in the area and figured I would check out the closest brewery, and I'm glad I did. I never like going to restaurants/bars alone, but I wanted to check it out their food menu (couldn't find it on their website) and pick up a growler of beer to take home. The bartender and one of the cooks (Dave -who ended up sitting next to me after his shift) were very friendly and informative. Not just on their beers but also other local establishments. Besides the great service,   the meat pizza was very good. The bartender offered me a few samples (loved the 5G Wit) but I ended up getting a growler of their West Coast IPA. Not a bad price either. Also, worth mentioning, this brewery also has a full liquor selection (which is rare for breweries).  Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have a place like this to call home now on the west side.  To start off the atmosphere is amazing. The decor of the place just sets it off for a fun and relaxing time.  I know it's only been open a week but the staff is rocking it out concidering it was soft opening all week. The food is amazing all made from in house so it's fresh everytime. I had the Beef Dip and OMG it's the best one I have ever had. They now have 6 beers to choose from which are all pretty tasty, I had a beer flight and tried them all. (Chasing Tail amber ale) is my fav. I definitely will be going back alot to hang out and bring my friends."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great atmosphere.  The owners are gracious and humble and make every effort to provide an amazing experience... and they just won an award for their beer?! Cornerstone of Goodyear"}
{"text":"We came in a Sunday evening. The place wasn't very busy. We were seated right away. Our waitress McKenzie was great. They have a great selection beers! I ordered the Ray Ray. It was absolutely delicious. Onion rings are also very good. Food was delivered quickly. What an awesome meal!!!"}
{"text":"The food lacks creativity and inspiration. 

The wings were pricey $10/10 they were drumettes so they were kinda meaty. The wing sauce has an identity crisis, it's half Franks and half Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, a lousy combination. My $10 burger did not come with fine shredded lettuce as the menu indicates it came with a flimsy piece of green leaf lettuce. The red onions were very scant, nor was I asked how I wanted the burger cooked. You can probably get a better burger at Dead Robin....The fries were dry and did taste like fish some. Her $13 Rueben had a shred or 2 of sauerkraut and the corned beef seemed to be rubbery like it was boiled all day and had no flavor at all. 

Service was good and the place is nice. It's very unlikely we will return."}
{"text":"Came in to get a burger and was blown away.  The place is small and tucked away but man their food was amazing.  Small locally owned business with great service and great food."}
{"text":"Best french dip!  Bison burger is also a hit! Great beers and service. We will be back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Sampled the beers across the board, didn't walk away all that impressed with any of them.... kind of picky though so can't fully blame them there.  At the same time none of them were bad, but their flavors were pretty generic and tasted about the same across the board for what we got.

Service was OK, but ordered a Bison Burger medium and it was somewhere between well done and hockey puck.  As an elite burger snob, this was a big miss and pretty disappointing.  Gamey meat is dry to begin with; when cooked to a crisp I was thankful for the amount of toppings.  I mentioned it, and was told \"Yeah, our head cook isn't in tonight and this is what you get as a result.  Sorry!\".  While I appreciated the honesty, $16 for a badly cooked meal is too much for my liking and I don't think I would give them my patronage again as a result."}
{"text":"Waited an hour on a slow Sunday afternoon to be told, \"sorry we're having problems in the kitchen\".   My kids order came out 10 minutes apart but my wife and I were never served.  The waitress said she would take care of our drinks as we watched everyone else get served.  I eventually told my waitress to just cancel my order.  A gentleman came out of the kitchen shortly after to apologize and said they would take care of our meal.  I appreciated that, but at that point 75 minutes had passed on a simple mother's day outing with the family and it didn't matter as our time had been ruined."}
{"text":"The brew in this establishment is amazing! They have an IPA that is tasty and strong. I first started going here when I moved into town with a new job. The staff is above friendly and if you go there often they treat you like family. Not one bad experience there ever. I would recommend this brewery to anybody and everybody. Right of the 10, a little tricky to find, once you get there, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fun find with great brews and good food!  Unique menu with items made in house. The only reason for not giving five stars is that the servers were very inattentive."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to stop by this brewery for lunch today.  I didn't have a beer, but my husband tried the Belgian Tripel.  He said it had a smooth taste, non hoppy and fruity. Definitely one to get!  We had the pretzel bites with the beer cheese, about the best we've had!   I had the pizza. The crust was light, fluffy and not over cooked!  Hubs had the Thai wings. Really, this place is amazing.  Food is good. Service is getting better, atmosphere is fun and exciting. Char was amazing.  We WILL definitely return and have Char take care of us!!!"}
{"text":"Ok here we go,,, nice place , bartender was accurate on he's suggestions with the beer , I had the chips and salsa it was good , nice kick with the spice , small detail hard to get, sadly the corn and beans mix is from a can but still pretty good with the pico mix , after that I had the jalapeño bombers .... awesome !!! Nice flavor nice presentation , taste pretty good... keep it like that  next time I'll stop by for dinner looks pretty impressive... pictures of them"}
{"text":"The food is something else! Servers took care of customers very well and were welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Shout out to Hayden for the stellar service she provided. Really made our visit memorable. This is a cool place and took my team here for lunch. Prices were good for what they offer. and really cool aviation themed decor. The sandwiches and burgers are good portions and will make anyone happy. The bison burger looks amazing, but I opted for the Rachel (name of an ex too).  Its a twist on the traditional Ruben (not an ex) which I liked much better. Plenty of beers on tap and they have daily specials. We all also ordered flights to try the beers they offer. I really liked the 'Strawberry Bitc*'. Yes Bitc*. And shes good.  Crisp, light and refreshing. If I'm in Goodyear again, I will def come back. Wish we had a place like this in TX."}
{"text":"Okay now listen...I was hesitant to try this place because of a couple reviews, but I have to tell ya...this place is AMAZING. The beer, the food, the ambience, the customer service...just awesome. I had the flight of beers with 6 to choose from, it was happy hour so it was only $8, the beer was great and I'm not a beer drinker. We had the Jalepeno poppers az an appetizer...wow...so good. It was filled with a mixture of sausage and cheese and some type of aioli. A must have! I had the fish tacos for my entree that came with black beans...i thought it was just going to be some mediocre type of blackbeans and corn but nope...so very flavorful. The tacos were so delicious, with breaded Alaskan Cod and tomatoes, cabbage, green onions and cheese...the food was just so mouth watering good, hat I didn't want to finish it...I wanted to save it to eat it again later...but of course I finished the hell out of it! My husband had the Bison Burger with fries, and Cole slaw. ALL AMAZING! THEN we tried the Bloody Mary which was garnished with sausage, cheese, olive and okra...with spicy pepper vodka...just wow! The prices are a bit more than what we like to spend, however, you're paying for great food and everything in between. You will not be dissapointed. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Seriously 1 tortilla 1 dollar? Hahahaha i got fajitas with just two tortillas, who eat just two tortillas? Well the fajitas were pretty good, and I used to go there with friends but since that time I won't go again, I can't believe they make me pay 1 dollar for 1 tortilla!!!! When you can get a big packet of tortillas for 3 dollars Hahahaha I'm sorry but that is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Just OK, not great food but ok, not great service but ok, beer was decent, and prices were middle of the road. Many other places I would choose first."}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker, but my husband is and really likes their IPA.  The food is good too.  The strawberry chicken salad is my favorite.  The only on is that they do not do Happy Hour on Fridays.  Otherwise this is one of our favorites when we go out locally."}
{"text":"Not bad... But not great either.  Tried the stouts and I was somewhat impressed.  Nice coffee tones, smooth with a hint of vanilla bite. 
The food... Well, needs a little improvement. Ordered the Pimento Bacon Cheeseburger with the beer cheese. It was missing something... More cheese, aioli, or something. The burger was cooked to order, juicy, but just missing a key element. Plain fries for the side... Boring. How about using real skin potatoes with roasted garlic and truffle oil. Just and idea. 
As for the fish tacos... A fishy idea. Raw cabbage, half a slice of tomato, fried fish on a flour tortilla and a drizzle of tarter sauce.  Personally I would have done a chipotle lime cabbage, fresh pico de gallo, broiled flakey white fish on a corn tortilla. The side of mixed corn/black beans was simply plain & cold. Easily livened up... Jalapeño, cilantro, onion, etc.  As for the plain yellow cheese... Try cotija cheese instead. 

Liven up the food a bit and experiment with the menu... Would make a much better brewery!"}
{"text":"Fresh, local, delicious. Go on Wednesday to try their homebrew for less."}
{"text":"One word...WOW!...The Beer..Awesome!..The Food..Awesome!..The Service..Awesome!..The Staff..Awesome!..The Live Music..Awesome!..This place is Awesome!!..Do not pass up an opportunity to enjoy this brewery!..Okay two words..WOW and Awesome!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is amazing! Their burgers are on point for sure! I know everyone has their preference...mine is for cold beer! I just wish theirs was colder! I also wish they had their blueberry beer more often!"}
{"text":"NOT impressed!  

The server had absolutely no knowledge regarding the beers brewed and/or served on the premises. 

Very limited menu (and unimpressive), poor attitude of server.

I WILL NOT RETURN TO SADDLE MOUNTAIN BREWING COMPANY I PREFER TO GO BACK TO THE LICHFIELD TAPROOM!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but def good quality all around. Very good microbrews, best battered fish ever, sides all topnotch. I took off one star because they charge 2.50 for simple substitutions or minor additions. They also booked a kids bday party in the bar? what? I left my own kids home...to have adult time away...?"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. We had \"the purest pastrami  sandwich & the fish & chips. 
 The pastrami was awsome! The rye was tasted just right! Also substituted the onion rings for fries. Just the right choice!
  The fish and chips were good. The fish was served hot but the fries were a little cool. 
   We would visit here again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"So might be me just being exposed to lots of food in Los Angeles, I am here for a visit and everything seemed pretty average. Macaroni and cheese is pretty bland, and the pizza was pretty average. Just was hoping for something a little more flavorful. I think my only suggestion was change the cheeses they use on the pizza and the mac and cheese. Get some jack and cheddar in there."}
{"text":"First time with daughter and husband and kids , great service, great staff , i will cut to the chase had a couple of different beers and we had 3 different things of menu which all were very good ,   one note that fire burger was excellent but left that fire taste which was good wow, they were great with the grandkids, I can't believe they didn't tell me about this when it it first opened, to the staff see you soon"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my wife and her parents for dinner.  The inside of Saddle Mountain Brewery is somewhat large with bars on both sides of the restaurant and some booths and tables in the middle.  Behind the back bar you can also see the brewing equipment (fermenters) so can tell that the beer is brewed here.  It is decorated to look industrial so you can she the air ducts, there's so pipes separating a bar and dining room and the light covers looked industrial as well.  Last but not least they have a little merchandise area where you can buy apparel, pint glasses, etc.

As I often do whenever I visit a new brewery I went ahead and ordered a flight of beer.  At Saddle Mountain a flight consists of 6 beers and I chose the IFR Nitro (oatmeal stout), Rays Gold (IPA), Hop Snob (west coast IPA), 300 Foot Steve (imperial red), clandestine (Scottish Ale) and Hops and Oats (OPA).  All of the beers here ended up being good representations of their types with my favorites being the west coast IPA and the OPA.  As an appetizer our group ordered the nachos.  While we were waiting for them the waitress came back and told us that they were out of the pork chili verde and asked if we would like chicken breast instead.  Since we didn't have much of an option we agreed.  As soon as they put it down it looked great.  The chips were clearly freshly made and not of your standard variety.  All of the toppings worked well with the nachos too and I especially loved all of the jalepenos they put on it.  I think that they did this to compensate for the fact that the chicken wasn't in a chili verde sauce and so this may not be standard.  Then for my entree I went with the fire burger.  It consisted of a burger, fire roasted poblano chile, spicy chile pepper blend, poblano cream cheese, pepper jack cheese, fried onion straws, onion and lettuce all on a brioche.  As you can imagine it definitely had a bit of a kick to it!  It wasn't overly spicy though and the brioche bun was a good pick as it held together throughout my eating of it.  The burger was cooked nicely and my favorite part was probably the fried onion straws which gave the burger a lot of flavor and a little bit of a crunch too.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  All of the food here was really good and the beers were too."}
{"text":"I found MY spot. I love the atmosphere so cozy but modern. The waitress was friendly,  quick, and on top of her game. The food was delicious! !! A little pricey for lunch but will definitely eat there often."}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to be able to give this place 5 stars. The food and the beer were SO good, and such a nice surprise on our side of town.
I got fish and chips, my husband got french onion soup. I'm a sucker for french onion, and it was amazing. My fish and chips were really great, especially for being in the middle of the desert. The breading was flavorful and crispy, the fish tasted fresh. The beers were standard, good solid craft beers with nice variety between the flights we got.
However, the service was TERRIBLE. It was a busy game night and granted, they aren't a sports bar. They were busy and needed more open tables. But our server - whose name I know, but will not include to be kind - at NO point made us feel welcome or engaged us in any sort of conversation outside of our orders. She made us feel like we needed to leave as soon as possible. 
We were brought our bill before we were asked if we needed anything else; we had planned on ordering more beers and possibly dessert - which meant they missed out on a larger bill, us staying longer, and a larger tip.
All in all, we'll be back to give it a second chance because the food was amazing and I want to try dessert. Hopefully that'll offer the opportunity for better service."}
{"text":"Lots of variety of handcrafted beer but the recipes are nothing new or even that different.  Typical brewery where they throw in lots of hops and give it some hip name. Unfortunately the beers have no balance and are not drinkable.  German pretzels were nothing I've ever had, even in Munich.  They were mini loaves.  You can't go to watch sports on TV as the screens are mounted so high you set stiff neck before you can choke a beer down.  Too bad.  The area could really support s quality brew pup. This just isn't one."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and professional, the beer is great and the food is of high quality. My favorite is the Hop Snob IPA and the beef sliders. Great wings as well."}
{"text":"We visited Arizona to see a friend and we decided to have lunch at this Brewery. I had to push straw me sandwich and it was actually delicious. It had the perfect amount of pastrami and the fries were really good too. Service is great and we would definitely go back if we were out there again. Oh, of course the beer was good as well. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"A very unique place to eat! Local brewery, good food and greag friendly atmosphere.  Try the French dip with a pint and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The service has been great both times I've been there. Fish tacos are a good first chose plus the red ale."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we were not disappointed. We were immediately sat down at a bar top. Our server Ivy was very sweet and suggested beers for us to order on our flight. The nachos are tasty and I recommend the Chasing Tail as a beer or as a mixed drink, the Pin-Up Martini. We will becoming back!"}
{"text":"I love SMBC! The food here is always on point and the service is fantastic. The buffalo burger is probably the best I've had in AZ. Definitely a little gem on the west side."}
{"text":"Food good, beer meh, service HORRIBLE!!!! 3 waitresses and 4 tables occupied, you'd think we would get exceptional service...well you're wrong! They spent most of their time sitting around and talking to each other than checking on their tables. Our waitress was M.I.A. for about 17 minutes. We were low on waters & beer, my daughter needed more ketchup and our Hot wing pizza was missing the ranch sauce. I had to go up to her and ask if she would bring us our check!!!! my husband was not impressed with the beer, very okay. I ordered the Triple B Hamburger with fries and it was tasty and the pizza was okay (minus the dry chicken)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a pretty large menu. The beer was average but the Thai Pizza was tasty. The restaurant was pretty busy for being only 5pm. I'm pretty sure happy hour was going on but our waitress never explained it and I'm not sure if we received a discount.

The Thai Pizza was big and relatively spicy. I wish the pizzas were more of a personal size because we would have liked to try a few different options.

Overall, nothing special but it was better than your typical sports bar."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Love there Thai wings! Great beer too! Staff is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"So I had the Mediterranean plater and an oatmeal stout. I landed here by accident and was pleasently suprised. They seem to have a good beer list. 

There menu to me seems a little limited but it would fit most people. The problem for me was I had a burger the day before and most of their menu is burgers and sandwhiches. 

I will say the plater was fantastic and hit the spot. 

My server was great but she was not my origional server. I was sat and given 1 server and I heard her say to the hostess in a snarkey tone is there only 1 person. She took my drink order and suddenly a new server came over to take my food order. I was fine with that because the first girl seemed like a jerk. 

2nd waitress was really nice and seemed happy to serve me. If I go back I will make sure to ask got her and would sooner leave then be waited on the jerk from the first time. I never got her name and she never gave it."}
{"text":"WOW what a great brewery and food , sliders, wedge salad and a great IPA .
thank you it was worth the drive !"}
{"text":"Great beer & great food, what else do you need.
Some friends and I came here to expand on our brewery explorations as it is quite far away from my house (about 45 minutes without traffic). I was pleasantly surprised to see they had 12 of their own brews on tap; awesome. We got two flights consisting of their entire selection. Of the twelve, only two of them didn't do anything for me, but the remaining ten were all winners. I was particularly a fan of the Hop Snob west coast style IPA, Warhawk Cream ale, IFR Outmeal Stout and Show Your Stripes Honey Ale. 
Not only are there great brews, but the food is terrific too. On my first visit I tried the pretzels and hot wings, both A+ (the honey mustard with the pretzel made it!). On my second visit I shared a pizza; the Italiano. I don't think they are brick oven pizza but it sure tasted and appeared as such, which I absolutely loved. I would recommend the pizza to anyone!
To top it off, the servers there were all really friendly, talkative and gave the place a very welcoming vibe; somewhere one can really hangout with their friends and family. If it wasn't across town from me, this would definitely be a regular spot for me, but if you're ever near Goodyear/Avondale, go check em out!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal. Beers change regularly and are a great variety. Staff is friendly and a great place for a low key date night or dinner with the family."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited on St. Patrick's Day. The place was packed and we waited for a table for a bit, but the day was beautiful and we didn't mind the wait. I had the club sandwich and a beer, and my boyfriend had the Ruben. Both were just amazing! We were treated to a bagpipe player halfway thru the meal, which was surprisingly enjoyable. Service was good, the atmosphere was noisy but fun. Can't wait to go back'"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place, from the service to the food. We had chips and salsa and Jack Daniels whiskey infused cream with fresh berries. Well, I had two of those. We will definitely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the food. Others seemed to be really enjoying themselves and having fun. We had a strawberry and chicken salad with a thai pizza and neither were very good and the thai pizza was incredibly salty. Probably a great place to hang with friends and have a few drinks, though."}
{"text":"I have been here at least three times and never any complaints. Great menu with lots of options for a brewery. Large, cold, yummy margaritas. Huge fan of the Triple B burger and Freedom Fries. The burger has an awesome egg bun, bacon, onion straws, bbq sauce, cheese, onion, tomato, lettuce. Huge, thick burger. Good looking salads, Mexican food. Something for everyone here. I'm a fan of their soundtrack too, includes Pearl Jam genre music."}
{"text":"Waited forever for a table which is normally a sign that this will be a good place-no so much. The waitress dumped the sample of beer on my leg. Didnt even get napkins to help clean up, just laughed it off. The pretzels were great, that is why they get 2 stars. The food was super greasy and I could not finish my meal because it was so unsatisfying.  The live music was nice as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great brew!!  We will be eating here frequently for sure.  Nice to have a brewery in my community that serves great food.

First time here and I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! GREAT DRINKS AND GREAT SERVICE! ......After a few not so great experiences we decided to give Saddle Mountain another shot and glad we did!  I had a friend in from out of town and told him it was a great place but to expect poor service and a long wait for food... man were we proven wrong! We walked in, were greeted promptly and seated quickly, the hostess was extremely friendly and nice. 

Our server (Nicole) was awesome! She was very attentive and recommend some awesome beers. We ordered and were both shocked how quick the food came out.  Nicole was extremely personable and relates to her guests well and even asked us if we were heading to spring training and some special event with Saddle Mountain.  

I can say that Nicole's amazing service and our overall experience were great and definitely changed our opinion of Saddle Mountain!  I hope the management sees these posts and thanks Nicole and your staff for ensuring that we are repeat customers!  Like the headline says everything was great! Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with our experience here (and we didn't even get to eat here).  We called on Friday to see if we could get a Saturday evening reservation, early like 6 ish...   Even though early we knew with a larger party it would be hard to seat us on a Saturday.   The girl would not take our reservation, she said nothing under 10... and said Friday is usually the busy night not to worry.   

We were taking this group out for my daughter's birthday, by the way.   So we show up little before 6pm to lines out the door and an hour and 15 min wait.    When I said I was disappointed in this because we could not make reservations she seemed confused and said, they won't make same day reservations, but she would have taken ours since it was the day before.   

Honestly we were excited to try this place, it was a special night for my daughter, and we were stuck scrambling to find a place at 6pm same night!   Super disappointing, especially since it made no sense to me that they would not take a reservation - especially for a larger party and on a weekend!    

We found another place and had a good meal and birthday but boo on your policy - at least make sure everyone is educated as to what it is!"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago with friends. We sat on the patio and that was a big mistake! We were very much ignored and waited too long for everything. We got the wrong beer brought to us and had to wait forever for the correct one. No apology, nothing. The only good thing was the green chili Mac. Although the portion was small! It was more of a side. My husband was still hungry so he ate my burger. The burger was OK kind of dry. Had to ask for ranch and mayo in which we were charged for as well. Like really? Not sure about all the great reviews, but we were all disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times and we still don't like the pizza, but their Happy Hour is ok. The sliders are excellent as are the nachos. They use green verde chile pork on them that stands out and is excellent. The bruschetta is excellent. The Happy Hour deals are so so; $2 off appetizers and $1 off beer and wine. If the specials were better, I would bump this up to a 4 star."}
{"text":"1st time here.  The beers are very good.  I got a bison burger, very delicious. I would rather have truffle fries but hey its still good.  Service too, very attentive. Also I love the music here"}
{"text":"So I have gone a few more times and they don't have the beer I like anymore. Now what has turned me off officially from going is that they will not be carrying their delicious chili cheese fries any longer. They are changing their menu. So, I am uncertain if you should even bother."}
{"text":"Lacie (bartender)
Best bartender I have had in a long long time! Friendly, quick, pays attention to detail! When you come in, sit at the bar and ask for Lacie! She's the best! Master mixologist and awesome to chat with! 
Would recommend to all of my friends and family!
Thanks Lacie!!! You're Effin awesome!"}
{"text":"For so long, we have loved the friendly hometown feel of Goodyear but missed local businesses like those in downtown phx. Saddle Mountain is just the thing we have been missing. The seasonal beer we tried was delicious. We will definitely be frequent patrons of SMBC. So happy to welcome this local business out west. Drink local!"}
{"text":"Beer is good but food is inconsistent. I ordered the grilled cesar chicken salad 4 times and it came out different 3 out of the 4 times. Not what one expects when paying $14 for a salad at a place in goodyear, az. The brew is really good and resonably  priced. I'd give it more stars if it weren't for the bad attitude of some of their lead staff."}
{"text":"I'm from chicago, and visited my friend  in arizona. Best service I have ever received. Coming from Chicago i thought service would be slower. It wasnt . It was the best service I've ever had. Memo my was my server and he was phenomenal. Thank you for the hospitality, it will never be forgo"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service.  We got there about 1:20 in the afternoon on a Friday, and the place was packed. We were told that the wait would be 15 minutes. No big deal because we were heading to the baseball game after, and the stadium didn't open till 4:00. 
A table cleared, and the hostess went to clean it for us. While she was in the back putting the dishes up some people came in thru the patio exit door and just took our table. How rude is that? Obviously they new someone there because some guy had their beers poured and to the table as they were just sitting down.
The hostess didn't even realize that the 2 people sat down, and grabbed 2 menus to seat us. I told her someone else took our table. When I brought it to her attention,  she looked confused, and said she would be right back. I thought she would rectify the problem,  but nope. All she said is that she was sorry and they have a table opening up outside on the patio. The people on the patio weren't gone yet. So who knows how much longer we would have to wait.
I have a concept, instead of having the young hostess deal with, how about have the manager come out and speak with us. How about compensating us for your horrible customer service. 
We come out to spring training all the time,  I will never go back. Good beer and food cannot make up for horrible customer service.  
There were 2 seats in the bar, they could have moved them to the bar and given us the table we were waiting for."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We were so pleasantly surprised to find a place with amazing food in Goodyear! My husband and I were probably the only people in there who ordered water to drink so I can't speak for the beverages. It's busy for a good reason!"}
{"text":"I came in last night expecting to see my favorite brunette happy hostess, I believe her name was Brin. Unfortunately I was greeted by another host who was very unwelcoming and all over the place. The food was mediocre and not as I had remembered, it was a very unpleasant experience and I can definitely tell there has been a change in staff. Bring back the old employees!"}
{"text":"The beer flight was good, although I didnt love the amber beer. The double ipa was my favorite. Its a good atmosphere... Nice to have a couple beers with good music and not feel like youre at a club. Bison burger was delicious and the mac n cheese was great also. Friendly servers. Would totally come back for a second visit to see if I could change from 4 to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love the French Dip!  Its the best I've had, and I order it anytime it's on a menu anywhere.  The service is always good."}
{"text":"My first time here and I will definitely return. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad at all, considering how packed they were. 
I knew I wanted to try the Imperial Red and my dad had no idea, but our waiter made a very good suggestion for him and he loved the Cream Ale. 
I ordered the Pork Chili Verde and it was delicious!! Just the right amount of heat and the pork was fall apart tender. The salsa of roasted corn, black beans, onions and tomatoes complemented it perfectly. We split the donuts for dessert and the dipping glazes were so yummy, especially the vanilla! Highly recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the dessert is where it's at though we had a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie inside it with ice cream on top it's a must have!! Service was on point and if you are a beer drinker they have a great selection of award winning beers."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat and drink in Goodyear. The staff is always very friendly and helpful and I've never had a bad meal here. They even have happy hour all day on Mondays! I'll continue to be in here a couple of times a month as long as I live in Goodyear. I'm just so happy to have a brewery so close to home!"}
{"text":"The service is very slow. The servers do not know how to handle more than 1 customer at a time even though there are several at the table. We shared the beef dip sandwich and ended up being sick since about 3 AM. Lucky for us we have 2 bathrooms in our house. Don't go unless you want to end up with a stomach ache and sitting on the toilet numerous times the next day."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely delightful dining experience at Saddle Mountain Brewing Company a few nights ago.  Our small party of 4 sampled a variety of beers and enjoyed every single one--though my personal favorite was the amber.  The pretzel bites were great, the caprese salad hit the spot, the bison burger and roast beef dip sandwich were done to perfection. Quite a treat to find well crafted beers and a menu tailored with care.

Keep up the great work, we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Went with some family from out of town and by far some of the BEST food and beers we have had. Out of 7 of us, not one of us had a bad thing to say about our meals. We had the fish and chips, the Ray Ray, pastrami sandwiches, and nachos. The only thing we didn't like were the egg rolls. Everything else was amazing with great prices!Definitely looking forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in as much to have lunch as to sample a few beers.  We ended up sitting inside as the afternoon's heat was a little too much to enjoy the patio area.  I started off with a Chasing tail amber ale while I looked over the menu.  I ordered the Reuben sandwich while my wife ordered a Turkey Avocado sandwich.  She's not much of a beer drinker so she ordered the house Cab to go with her sandwich.  When my Reuben sandwich arrived, I was ready for another beer, so I ordered the Imperial Red.  Both sandwiches were great.  Service was good as our waitress made sure we weren't waiting on anything."}
{"text":"I met a few friends here for a \"gal's lunch\"...this was my first time, not theirs.  Firstly, I expected it to be a lot larger.  Nothing wrong with the size of the place, I think I was just expecting a huge dining room.  It was actually a very nice sized room...a lot of high tops (which I don't like, cause I'm short and hate when my legs dangle...LOL!).  But, I was able to get us a regular table.

My friends arrived and one of them chose a beer.  She wasn't sure what to get, so our waitress assisted her on making a decision.  I'm sorry to say, I don't remember the name of the beer, but she really liked it!

Both of my friends got Reuben's and I got the Beef Dip (as a creature of habit, if French Dip or Beef Dip are on the menu, I must order it!).  When the food came, there was a lot of it!  The Reuben's were huge!!  Mine was also a good size, plus I had added carmelized sweet onions, which were really good on it.  My only disappointment was...the description mentioned a horseradish cream with my sandwich.  I love horseradish cream with roast beef anything, but the cream tasted more like regular mayonnaise...it didn't have any kick to it, so I didn't enjoy that at all.

After eating most of our meals, we decided to share a dessert and got the brownie in a skillet with ice cream and caramel drizzle.  It was delicious!  If we had been hungrier, we probably would've finished, but we did pretty good with it, there wasn't much left.

The service was really friendly and attentive.  The food was pretty dang good.  Honestly, my only complaint was the horseradish cream, which would've put my Beef Dip over the top.  But, I will definitely be bringing the hubby to check this place out in the near future."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, food was amazing.  House made corned beef - the best we have ever had and we know Reubens.  So worth the drive from North Phoenix.  We will be back for the beer cheese pretzels and green chili."}
{"text":"Good family eatery. Food is good Can get pretty busy on the weekends like most places.  I enjoy the bison burger.
As others have mentioned, try the beer sampler!  Then you'll know exactly which beers you prefer.. great idea!  nice little brewery!"}
{"text":"We were lucky to find this restaurant on a recent trip to Goodyear. They have some very creative items on their menu- jalapeño bombers and Irish egg rolls. They were both great as was their pork chili verde. Their beer is also good. Service was very helpful. We went there three times during our trip and we'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fire burger was great and really spicy.  Fries are really good.  I took my parents and wife.  They also like what they got.  The beer is really for local beer.  I had the \"show your stripes\" beer.  It was good, I would order it again.  If you are looking for a brewery on the west side of town.  This is the place."}
{"text":"After visiting Four Peaks a few weeks prior, I was craving some of their delicious fries. However, the fries here did not even compare! 

My sister and I shared their Fire Burger, and it definitely lived up to the spice. I've tried spicy burgers at tons of other places, but it was never really that spicy. However, this burger was a little too spicy for my taste. There was literally a layer of pepper seeds in the burger. 

I did enjoy their beer flight. You can choose from 6 of their beers, and they were all pretty good and affordable."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The staff is amazing. Crystal, John, Mimi, Panda... The whole crew is tops!! So happy we found you! Love the pizza, fajitas are on point! Pretzel bites are great! Burgers are humongous so are the nachos!!! The Chile better pork is awesome and so much of it. And don't get me started on the desert! Brownie+ cookie=YUM"}
{"text":"Really good food.   Enjoyed the French dip sandwich,  excellent! My husband had the pastrami sandwich  and was so tender and had nice smokey flavor.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We really had a great time. Lots of great beers to try. Very friendly staff and excellent food. We even managed to get a tour of the brewing equimpent room."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!! A microbrewery in Goodyear .. FINALLY!!! 

The food is good, the atmosphere is like you're in your neighbors man cave and he suddenly brings out a home made keg, that's really the best way I can describe it from my experiences there. 

I'm not a beer aficionado but I liked what they brought me... the food was good, the service was good, I really can't complain here... ok maybe the service could have been a little better but in general not a disappointment. 

I can vouch for the pizza and the dip, both filled me nicely :)"}
{"text":"Happy to see  a new place open so close to home, great food, but they need to improve service. Too many servers standing around chatting."}
{"text":"Good brewery with a decent menu and prices.
My aunt and I stopped in for lunch as a break from our errands.
The manager, I didn't get his name, came around to each table, was super friendly, and even helped the wait staff. All the staff was friendly as well. As with most breweries, you may have to wait to order as it usually takes a while for someone to get to your table, we did have to wait a bit for someone to come take our order, but nothing that would deter me from going back (maybe 5-10min wait).
Being from Michigan, I love breweries! 
I try Mac n cheese everywhere I go and this Mac n cheese did not disappoint! I got the green chile mac. Fairly spicy but does not leave you wanting anything else!
I can't have beer, so I was disappointed to not see a cider on tap. But they did seem to have a good selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Good food great beer! My son recommended the Ruben sliders for dinner and they were fabulous and served on fresh pretzel rolls. I had the Tail Chaser ale and it was very good. Next time we're in town we'll be back."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, and everything I have ordered has been very tasty. 

We were in on a slow evening, and we were lucky enough to be able to sit and talk with their bartender who was responsible for their infused vodkas. Talk about amazing! We also like their beer tasting board, so you have the ability to try several of their beers before making your choice for a pint. As far as appetizers are concerned, we really like their Mediterranean platter."}
{"text":"The food, staff and beer is awesome this has become my favorite place to go in Goodyear. It's usually pretty busy but well worth the wait. Highly recommend their Chasing Tail Lager."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and I have to say it never disappoints. That being said had the best experience while bringing my in laws from Oregon for beer and the best burgers around.  Can't recommend this place enough and if you come at a busy time trust me it's worth the wait.  Our server Elizabeth was hands down one of the best servers I have had and she should be praised for a great experience.  Thank you SMBC for another great meal!"}
{"text":"With only one visit here, I've decided to make this one of my top favorite places in AZ. Service was great and the atmosphere is all around great. Food and beer though... both were the bomb dot com! Beer selection was great and amazingly tasting. Beer is affordable enough to get drunk there and burn a whole in your pocket lol food was sooooo tasty. I ordered what I thought was a simple cold turkey sandwich but turned out to be the be totally mouthwatering. 

Now the hubby and I don't drink much when we go out to eat, but this is definitely a place to do so. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband & I tried this place for lunch one day last month.  We ordered 3-4 items & shared so we could get a good sampling! We loved the food & drinks!  We will be going back for sure!  The only downside is we do have a gluten free kiddo & there are no options friendly to him, most 4 year olds don't eat salads. :("}
{"text":"Chicken tenders hamburger and hotdog were all fresh and kids loved it. Pretzel bun homemade and high quality ingredients. French dip amazing. Nachos good but way too much meat on it. Not much selection for a vegetarian. Chocolate stout cake-divine. Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"Great local place love the food (minus pizzas) love the beer. Salads are great maybe avoid the pizzas for now. Honest opinion."}
{"text":"After waiting at least a full hour for our 6 top to be served 4 salads and 2 entrees we decided to skip our meals and leave. We arrived at 7:30 and by 8:30 it had become a joke. The waitress tried her best and we tipped her fairly for our drinks in spite of her apologies and insistence that she would cover our food. Honestly, it was embarrassing having recommended this place to my co-workers for dinner only to have to leave an hour later without food. I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a bite and my husband really enjoys there beers. Get a growler to go."}
{"text":"I'd had gone here about three weeks ago and I've been eager to go back. The service was pretty slow at first as there was only one server and one bar tender. However, the girls did there best and were very sociable and friendly. They also apologized for any waiting. The food was good. I got the chili fries which was a small portion but they were really good, my only suggestion would be to add more to the portion for the price. We also had the Goodyear pizza which was pretty good. I very much enjoyed the pizza and the 12\" was enough for my husband and I to share. NOW the whole reason why I came here was because they have good prices on flights during happy hour and the beer was pretty good. I'll come check this place out again soon. Nice atmosphere and vibe."}
{"text":"We travel to Sadona alor so we thought we would try this place out as a mid trip luncg spot. Well the sandwiches were outstanding. Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Bison burger  are excellent. Fries are ok, onion rings are good if you like fat ones. But what are excellent are the onion straw garnish for the burgers. If i could get that as a side. Awesome! We asked, nope. Beers are as to your preference, some real good some meh. The only down side is, been there three times now, is the service is iffy. Always one waitress that is busting her butt great, a couple that are decent and try hard tge rest seem to be whishing to be somewhere else and it shows. Go for the food and hope you get a good server."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went here with our daughter. I got fish and chips ($12), as well as the Amber Ale ($4.xx); The lady got a Ruben ($13), and the little one got chicken strips ($5). The beer was pretty good. I will probably go back and get a growler of the ale, it's nothing too special; however, it's smooth and refreshing, making for a good session type beer. I'm certainly interested enough to try all the other beers they have to offer.

The food was certainly lacking. The fish that came with the fish and chips was reminiscent of Long John Silver's--certainly a step above, but still not so great. The fries were pretty good and the tartar sauce -- relatively surprisingly -- seemed to be house made and was decent. The coleslaw was god awful. It was bland and essentially tasted like they had done barely anything to the cabbage/carrot mix. 

I didn't try my fiancée's ruben so I can't speak too much to it; however, it was unusually fatty -- even for pastrami. The meat was cooked inconsistently; parts of it looked like roast beef. All in all, it was not a $13 sandwich.

The kids chicken strips was your standard bar-type chicken strips. I don't think this would bother most people, but I was expecting a little more from a micro-brewery. I wouldn't think it is too difficult to make up a nice batter with some of that lovely beer, and deep fry some fresh chicken! I suppose it shouldn't be too big a deal as the kids meal was only $5, but I would pay more for better. 

I'd go back for the beer, and maybe munch on some fries if I get a little drunk, but I probably won't dine here again."}
{"text":"Food and beer were so-so, waiter was solid but hostess and management were less than courteous, outdoor patio was pleasant. Aside from location there isn't much that would draw me back here."}
{"text":"the place is cute, but I really don't think it was worth the money.  It may have been an off day, I would give it another chance."}
{"text":"Good beer! Ordered fish tacos they were so so. The hot wings were delicious. Staff was okay too. Great decor!"}
{"text":"Way, way, waaaaaay out west, there's virtually nothing that isn't a chain. If you want something new, this is one of the only options. And it's not a bad option to have!

Saddle Mountain started making brews back in 2012, but the restaurant itself appears to be a much newer establishment. It's a run-of-the-mill American menu, and like its larger and well-known competitors, has beer pairings for the menu. 

It seats several dozen, and still feels a little bare-bones, as though there's plenty of space to be filled with more decorations. For now, it's still a decent place to catch a game. My burger was pretty good. The flatbread, slightly bitter after an IPA infusion, was sparse on toppings, and resembling something closer to a bruschetta than a thin-crust pizza. Disappointing. Nevertheless, there are plenty of options, so I'd try more. 

I didn't have too much of the beer itself, but I must say theirs was easily in the top 5 red ales I've ever had. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and so far would actually prefer these beers over some bigger local names. 

So I know this is a long haul for most of us, but I must say it's worth going out of the way, if not for surprisingly great beer. I guess I have a reason to go to Goodyear after all!"}
{"text":"We have been there twice sine the opening and coming back may be in question. We waited an hour for dinner last night. That should be only one star. The food and beer make the difference. Our server was top notch tonight. Last time one of the serving staff did not know where the restroom was located. The server last night should never be put in a situation of apologizing for lack of kitchen management. Saturday night should have been all hands on deck but the head chef had the night off. Really? Please fix this issue before it is to late."}
{"text":"Bar staff was extremely unfriendly - we were there sat 17 feb from 1450-1800.
  The girl behind the bar had the worse attitude, unfriendly, unprofessional, slow, if u hire people like this you will be out of business soon.
I am shocked about the  way we were treated at this place ."}
{"text":"Had never been here before and decided to try it with my husband and his friend from out of town. Sampled all twelve beers and they were all unique and very good. Also had the nachos and Thai wings. The nachos and wings were both delicious. The service was okay. We had asked to be sat closer to the bar, so without even looking at us the hostess says, \"sure\" in a very short tone and then seats us closer.. The waitress didn't all seem that interested in us or how everything was either. The manager was very nice when he came to check on us. Overall, the food and drinks were great, but service was just okay."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and both times I've been surprised by the food. The jalapeño poppers are unlike any poppers I've had before, but they are actually really good. Same with the nachos. Nothing like you expect nachos to be, but DELISH!

The one thing I'm not keen on is the chicken they use on the pizza and other items. It is so damn salty! Mentioned it to the waitress the first time, but the next time it was just the same, so I guess that's how they cook it.

Not a bad place though and we'll definitely be going back.

Since it's a Brew Pub, guess I should mention the beer! Hubby loves it! Enough said!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of people from work. It was a good time with a aviation motif. The servers were dressed like Rosie the Riveter. We ordered drinks and dinner. We sat outside in an area which was heated and had a strip of tables. Which was still casual yet, not as loud. We talked to the waitress and wondered if the hair bandanas are required and they are, but not provided. I guess that plays into the motif? 
I ordered the fire burger and substituted the beef with chicken. It was really good. I was pleased with the serving size, the flavors. The burger was a tasty blend of textures and flavors. It was a great place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and food was incredible. Had the pork tacos and the corned beef. All very good. Then we got to the donuts and OMG so good. Best of all tho was the service. Spot on with friendliness and suggestions. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I recently relocated to the West Valley and I am exploring new territory. I noted not long after moving to the neighborhood that the parking lot around this place is always crowded. I checked out the Yelp reviews and decided to give them a try.

We were seated immediately and given a choice of a table or a booth.  Our server was prompt and attentive. My roommate and I ordered a couple of apple ciders, the stuffed mushrooms, Irish eggrolls, the grilled pastrami with onion rings, and the donuts for dessert. Everything we ordered was tasty.  We have no complaints. In fact, before we completed our meal we vowed to return, but next time we are going to walk there so that we can sample a lot of whatever they are brewing."}
{"text":"When you visit a restaurant in its opening days, it's expected that things will be a little uneven. That said, this place shows lots of promise.

The negative straight up: Service was extremely slow. Our server was pleasant, but trying to be multiple places at once; communications with the bar weren't flowing well. I saw our beer flight sitting on the bar for over five minutes (I timed it) before our server went to fetch it.

However, there are bountiful positives. My husband loves craft beer and there's not much available on the west side, much less places that offer growler fills. We ordered the beer flight. My husband found them all drinkable and had to really debate which of his new favorites to get as a growler.

We were visiting mid-afternoon on Sunday and didn't need a full meal. We ordered the pretzel appetizer. Now, I'm a bread snob; I make all my bread at home. These are exceptionally good pretzel sticks--perfect chewy texture with proper pretzel salt on top. The cheese dip was what really made this awesome. It had real body and complex flavor--cheese and some kind of ale, and it was thick so it actually stayed on the pretzel bread. (Applebees serves nasty, watery cheese dip--bleh!)

I watched all the other food that passed by. The pizzas here looked and smelled good, too.

We will definitely be back! Here's hoping they get lots of business and attention, and the service issues are resolved with time and experience. We certainly need more good, local places like this."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last Friday night. I wasn't impressed for many reasons. Firstly, the wait time was considerably long for the amount of people that was there. It isn't a large place and more than one table was empty. The hostess suggested a small 'bar area' that is suitable for drinks and appetizers. So my friend and I walked over and after waiting for over 10 minutes, I stepped over to the bar and ordered 2 beers and closed out. This was the one and only time that night, that we had decent service. Eventually, 2 seats opened in the center of the bar and we weren't met with any greetings, etc. I ended up asking the bartender  for 2 menus, we received one minutes later. The bartender took our food order and another 2 beers. She asked if we wanted to close out, I merely assumed she was talking about the beers. She charged everything to my card. Found it strange and my friend agreed to pay her tip. We got out food a short while later and not once did the bartender come back to see if we needed anything else or if the food was good. The only time she came back was to retrieve the bill, to which she grabbed the clipboard, took a look at it and then threw the board down on the counter and walked away. The service was horrible and wouldn't go back, nor recommend this to anyone else."}
{"text":"We stopped here on New Year's Day after a super wet and cold camping trip in KOFA. It was a warm detour and was quaint and quiet and left us super glad we had stopped. 

The atmosphere is great and was the brewery we had been searching for since we moved to Arizona. We've discussed many a time how so many breweries here were lacking identity but this was the perfect mix of theme but not overly done. It still had plenty of touches that made it its own. This included a few punny signs around the joint and some indicators that an owner or perhaps family had once belonged to the military, which they openly support. 

The back wall has an amazing light up \"DRINK LOCAL\" sign that is too adorable and makes you feel proud to support local business. 

I had the pepper burger and my boyfriend the bison. Let me tell you that the burger I had was not for those who can't take the heat. I was basically in tears trying to consume it. It was perfect though, because I was suffering from a pretty gnarly sinus infection at the time. You could actually see the bits of red pepper flake and jalepeno inside the cheesy mix. It was very good, though. Just seriously hot. And it had me ordering another beer, so they win. Both IPAs that I had were VERY good, the perfect amount of hop. 

Overall it was a really great place with good food and great service. It wasn't overly crowded and we loved the flashback 2000 punk/emo music that was playing, very college flashback. Definitely check this out if you are heading on 10 past Goodyear; quick detour but worth it."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place 3 stars is we came in on opening day, and my nephew got sick and we didn't finish our meal. Appetizers and drinks were good and the service was fantastic. we plan to come back."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience at this place. I went with a large group of friends for a birthday dinner and the place was packed for a Wednesday. Our food and drinks were delicious and our server was amazing. The brewers nachos are sooooo good! I knocked off a star only because the mist fans on the patio were a little too much. I understand that it's Arizona, but man, I didn't expect to end the night looking like a poodle head. Too much mist!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour drinks and apps. The food is all made fresh and it's excellent. Not your typical greasy bar food. There always seems to be a wait in the evening on weekends. They have a huge selection of beers brewed on site. This place is a real gem for casual dining."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a place close to home that serves good food and craft beer! So far, food wise I've had the green chile, the chicken and biscuits, the pastrami, a pizza & have been happy with everything, really love the pastrami so it's hard to try other things. The only item I've tried and not liked were the pretzels, more like dry bread instead of a thick soft pretzel.  As far as the beers go, I really like the Belgian Wit and the Oatmeal Stout.  They also have occasional seasonal beers and specials on food. I know we will be frequent customers! Hope they have continued success!!!"}
{"text":"I love saddle mountain. My husband and I go a couple of times a month and my parents go weekly. The food is great the staff is super friendly and the beer is seriously good. Rays gold ipa is a good choice. They have a Thai chicken pizza that's very delicious"}
{"text":"If you like Craft Beer this is the place in the West Valley....The food is good and they change up their menu. The bartender Sierra always goes out of her way to chat with us and make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"Went here with friends and enjoyed the atmosphere, and vibe. Wings were good, and the beer flight is a great way to taste the beers for $9 and you get to choose six. The green teen chile stew dish was okay, and the Rachel was reported on my by friend as being tasty. The service was a bit scattered. We didn't get our beer until after all our food was brought to the table so timing was an issue. But it was easily overlooked! Just sit back and relax and enjoy this gem in the west valley."}
{"text":"The beer is on point. Many options and it's local which is great. I love to support them from that aspect. Chynna was an amazing server who was there for all our needs. We never waited for any food or drink refills with her as our server. We'll definitely be back to enjoy the new beers they keep rotating on tap! Definitely a great time!"}
{"text":"In short - overpriced poor quality meal

I have no problem spending $15 on a burger; but, when I do - I expect a $15 burger. When I order pretzel bites - I expect pretzel bites, not bread balls. Food-wise, we spent $40 on two burgers and an app thinking we're going to have a great date night meal. Barely through the app before the burgers showed up - had to rearrange the patty so I could actually get a bite of meat, which turned out to be not so good of a bite anyway. Portions, quality and overall value just not here. Felt like someone had an idea for a beer bar and considered food as an afterthought. Staff were all very nice. We won't be back though which does disappoint us. We'd much rather keep our money local than try yet another chain restaurant next night out..."}
{"text":"Had high hopes based of a friend's recommendation but instead it was a let down.  I give 2 stars as the beer was pretty good and the burger (when we finally got it) was tasty. We came in at about 8pm on 4/18. Dinner rush appeared to be mostly gone so it was about half full.  We ordered beer and and calamari appetizer which came out fairly quick. When we ordered dinner however, it took 35 minutes for it to come out. We witnessed our server sitting at the bar at one point, braiding another server's hair (yuck), and later when we asked her for a side of ranch, she went over to the server station and was counting her cash out for several minutes before she returned. It shouldn't take 35 minutes for a burger to come out. The food was good, hope you have better luck with service than we did."}
{"text":"Really love the beer, always amazing!  Management needs to upstaff and quit being CHEAP about staffing!  

There were empty tables outside, buy no wait staff.  A bunch of us waiting outside bitched and complained. Two couples left after we told them whats going on.

It's hard on staff, and hard on patrons.  Probably won't be back until they make those changes."}
{"text":"Went with my husband for lunch and it was amazing! I got the honey beer with my fish tacos and he got the show you'r stripes with his chicken bacon tacos! Could've been more staffed though! Other then that food and beer was delicious SHOUT OUT TO LACEY BEST BARTENDER EVERRRRR"}
{"text":"Saddle Mountain is a top notch local brewery. Their house beers are both smooth and strong and the food is delicious. Whether it's the pizza, the strawberry fields chicken salad, or the herb chicken salad... You can't go wrong. Friendly service + good beer + quality meals = a restaurant I'll be coming back to soon and often."}
{"text":"Food was good. Better than standard bar food but not phenomenal.  I had the bacon mac and cheese which I enjoyed a lot. Husband had the beef dip which he liked. Tried the Tuskegee Red Tail ale which we really liked a lot. Staff was friendly and attentive and we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The place looked nice but when we were seated we received dirty silverware, the waitress was okay, but the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza, it was not fresh it gave me a bitter taste in my mouth. The macaroni and cheese was good, but nothing special to come back for."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some gourmet mac & cheese and a Yelp search found me this place. I had no idea there was a brewery just down the road in Goodyear... and with strong reviews! My b/f and I thought we'd give it a try. They had some live music (The Spirited Lads) which seemed a little loud at first but we found ourselves entertained during the meal. The dining area really isn't very big, so I could see it getting pretty crowded on the weekends. Fortunately, it was a Wednesday. I ordered the Mac N' Cheese (shells, Gouda, Gruyere, and bacon w/ a small baguette) and my b/f had the Herb Chicken Sandwich with fries. We got our food in a timely manner and it was good, just had to pick off the scallions! The portions are not huge, pretty sensible really. The mac could even be improved upon if they added some of that herb chicken in there... But we were happy and I would like to go back and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. Just wow. I had a burger from here and it was fantastic. Im not a big specialty beer person so that was not a big appeal to me. But the food we had was beyond great. Just a piece of advice. Get the bloody mary. nice and spicy"}
{"text":"Usually I find something to nit-pick about a place to not give it five-stars but I can't this time. It was my first time here and the food was great, the prices were great (took advantage of some Sunday specials), the waitress was very good and the beers were plentiful. Though I don't recommend the Warhawk (a cream ale).

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in for a drink. Live music was great, very lively bar, nice bartenders, and amazing waitresses. Marissa catered to all our needs for drinks and was always there when I was running low to refill me with a refreshing Hop Snob! The beer at this establishment is unmatched in the west valley! Check it out!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.  Always great food and amazing beer.  We love to get their flight of beer.  Prices are great.  A wonderful, local place to support."}
{"text":"Excellent food, loved the buffalo burger!great service; live music; their own brewery; it's about time Goodyear has something unique....buuuuuuut they don't take American Express"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the dessert. Delicious food and if you're a drinker, they have a great selection of drinks. 

I had the triple B burger, which came highly recommended from Yelp. It was delicious and vey satisfying. French fries are BOMB! 

The dessert is even better! I had the drunken brownie and literally all my taste buds were exploding with flavor. 

If you live in the area, you definitely have to come visit."}
{"text":"Awesome pastrami awesome service
A new regular place for my wife and I to have drinks and lunch on our Monday date days"}
{"text":"This brewing house is located in an eclectic little shopping plaza. The SMBC itself, is very humble in esthetics, but has a cozy feel to it. (The two previous statements explain my reasoning for giving three stars instead of two) The beers aren't much to \"write home about\" and to their favor, that is reflected in the pricing. You could pick up better quality and tasting beer at Fry's. My party ordered, an array of items from the food menu. Overall, the food was bland and not well constructed. In my opinion, there were too many items on the menu and SMBC should scale back and focus on mastering a few. I'd spend a couple more bucks and go to the Yard House; if your watching your budget, you'd be better off going to Chili's."}
{"text":"We made the drive across town to Goodyear to catch the Tribe/White Sox, but we couldn't go without hitting another brewery first. Saddle Mountain was a worthy stop with a standard selection of no frills, solid beer. We also enjoyed some juicy burgers to fuel the drink train.

This location is the first micro brewery in Goodyear in which the owners, Jacob and Laura Hansen, had to go through a long, painstaking process of changing the city ordinances to allow the production of beer. Open for just over two years, you'll see indoor and outdoor seating, servers that have a pin up look, and pictures on the walls that show the owner's love of planes. The affection of planes is so great that his line of craft beers is named after a World War II plane, the Traildragger.

The beer list the day we were there consisted eight of their standard beers and three seasonals. A flight of six beers of your choice will cost $9. Beers ranged from a strawberry blonde to an imperial red called 300 FT Steve. This beer definitely stood out with an IBU of 90 and and ABV of 7.5. It started out surprisingly sweet, then had a very strong hoppy finish but it didn't linger for days. If we would have hung around, I would have enjoyed a full beer of this flavor. But whatever your style of preference, Saddle Mountain has it  and I'm sure you'd pleased with their take.

The food menu consists of a starters which includes a brewers board, pizza, salads, sandwiches, and skillets. Pairing suggestions are given with each entree. We each enjoyed a burger and I had a little sweat on my brow from the fire burger. The burgers aren't cheap with my brother's bison burger topping out at $16.50.

Service was satisfactory and our server did well as she was bum rushed with tables of mostly Indians fans trying to get some lunch before the game. Total for the flights and burgers was $53. Seeing that I'm an Indians fan and will continue to check out the Tribe in Goodyear on a yearly basis, there's a good chance I'll be back to Saddle Mountain on a yearly basis also."}
{"text":"I downloaded this app specifically to write a review on this place. The service is HORRIBLE. I sat at the bar for 15 minutes and didn't get any service at all. There were two bartenders and they were helping everyone around me but wouldn't even talk to me. Would never go back. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Need new staff."}
{"text":"I was a little harsh the first time around. Gave this place a second chance. It got worse. No prices posted for beers. Had posts for Happy Hour and Pint Night yet no one knew what those deals actually we're. We ordered nachos for an appetizer...They brought pizza to our table. Left after a beer and appetizer. Had to find somewhere else for dinner. 

I have it a second chance. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"Great place for craft beer and pub food. The Turkey Avocado Club is not to be beat.  Servings are very generous and staff is excellent. Enjoyed the patio with cool mist fans to stave off the AZ heat. Highly recommend this pace for drinks and a casual meal."}
{"text":"This has become a go to for me. Great environment! I've been to plenty of breweries but Saddle Mountain is by far the best! What I like most about this facility is their darkened but not too dark lightening, the music is good, the food is good, the beer is great, and the staff remember. I recommend this brewery to anyone!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this spot out yesterday and wish we had gone sooner. Would be an awesome spot to catch some football. Right off the 10, great spot for the West Valley! The atmosphere is very inviting, the beer flights are great and the food was delicious! Our waiter was the chef and he was very informative about the beers and food! Had the bruschetta to start, scrumptious! Split the smoked pastrami sandwich and the fire burger, amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"That lacy bartender is badass. She's quick and knows how to make drinks and tasty. Service is always quick and good. Never had anything bad here."}
{"text":"This is my families second time eating at saddle mountain and both times were fantastic. The food is amazing!!! I recommend getting the bison burger. You can also get the beer sampler, which is definitely worth it before ordering your choice of beer. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. I will keep coming back for that bison burger! 

Only thing I didn't like was the coleslaw, unfortunately there was no taste. I had to put salt and pepper in it and it helped, but I didn't finish it. Like I said BISON!!! . Will come again."}
{"text":"Wow, hidden in a mini mall is this brewery, find this place and go. Red tail and chasing tail beers are good, Thai wings are very good, the homemade pastrami is incredible, nice and tender great flavor  with the rye bread,and the onion rings and the cole slaw were great as well."}
{"text":"This palace is awesome!!!!! GREAT beer GREAT food GREAT service! Good music, laid back great staff!"}
{"text":"We have been to Saddle Mountain several times for dinner.  I really want to like this place but wish they had a better selection of wine.  When we go out with our friends, the guys love their beer but usually the gals like to have wine.  The only kind of white wine they have is Woodbridge!  Yuck.  The food is decent (good burgers) but the terrible selection of wine is keeping me away."}
{"text":"Hand picked location fir location fir lunch. The oatmeal stout was fine but not as robust as I prefer. The smoked turkey bacon sandwich was fabulous. Combined they hit the spot. Service was great. Will definitely consider this local again if in the area."}
{"text":"Not from around here, and always looking for a good local place to visit (non-chain). This place lived up to my search efforts!! Great beers, amazing starters (highly recommend the Jalapeño Bombers and Stuffed Mushrooms), and the Reuben tops it all off. If in Goodyear, this place is a must-eat!!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in our visit last week. My biggest complaint is the prices. $16+ for a burger and fries is crazy talk. Same with sandwiches. I got the Rachel and because of the price I was expecting several pounds of meat similar to NYC deli styles. It came out with minimal meat. Overall the food was just ok but we paid $40+ for a burger and sandwich. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places I've been to in forever.   Beers are great. Loved the ipa grapefruit!!! So yummy. Only complaint is that our waitress took forever but the managers came around quite often that made up for her absence.   Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This is really more like a 3 1/2 star experience. It has been a while since we were in last so we decided to go in for a late lunch on Friday. It was fairly busy with no where to sit at the bar so we sat at a table. While the food we had was excellent unfortunately our service was not. It was super slow and no one even checked on us after we got our food. I would have definitely ordered another beer if asked. I decided to order a growler to go which took forever to get but I guess they were having issues with the keg. The unfortunate part is when I got home and tried the beer that was so amazing at the restaurant it was flat. Sad face. I probably should have taken it back but we had a busy weekend ahead and ended up pouring the majority of it down the drain. 
I really like this restaurant and hope that the service improves. We will be back but I will definitely sit at the bar next time."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, drink, and have a great time with friends and family. Everything on the menu is awesome! I recommend the soft pretzels, Mac and cheese, pizza, and fish and chips!"}
{"text":"The Rachel , all I can say is WOW !!!!! I have a lot of pastrami this was the best !!!! My husband had fish n chips also very good. But the pastrami on a pretzel bun incredible!!!!! We live 4 hours away, but my kids just moved to the Avondale area , can't wait to come back to Saddle Mountain.. Oh and to see the kids .."}
{"text":"Met family while visiting the area.  Food was good, my fish tacos had a weird piece of fish but it was tasty.  Everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Good gastropub food but takes a long time if it's crowded. A good selection of micro brews with a couple of IPAs with 75 IBUs. Visited before a Reds spring training game"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  We received mixed reviews between Yelp and Rate Beer. We decided to try it and were pleased. The food was unique and delicious.  The beer was awesome as well. Loved the WWII ESK theme, friendly atmosphere, and great server Mia. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So here we are again .. 
In the last few months we have had anywhere from three to four and a half star experiences here (usually once a week or so.). The beer is better, the bartenders are wonderful and when the rush isn't on the food service is good as is most of the menu.
Clearly there is a problem when they are Saturday night busy.  
Nearly an hour at the table waiting for two cheeseburgers and a chicken sandwich?  The response from our server when we inquired about our food?  'The kitchen is really backed up ....' ??!!  Really?  Who trained her?  How about 'let me check and see what I can do...'
We're stuck.  We live in Goodyear and this about the only place resembling something other than chain-food-America.
I don't know.  I'm tired of paying for just better than okay food and unspectacular service .. So for those of you reading this saying 'why don't you just stay home' ... I'm way ahead of you."}
{"text":"Okay- So we've been back a few times since my first review. Wait staff has improved- they are friendly, prompt and attentive. The food remains to be mediocre and despite the new menu items - the menu remains lackluster. The beer menu has way too many IPA's on it- good if you like IPA's - bad if you don't. They still have to step it up. I believe the only reason they have business is because they are the only brewery in the southwest valley."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great beer choices, excellent happy hour and phenomenal food. Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food, great beer, family friendly.  Most of the servers are efficient and friendly. Clean, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was the first pastrami I've ever had. I came to Saddle Mountain with some buddies that wouldn't stop talking about this place (and for good reason). Once they found out that I had never had pastrami, that was the only thing they would let me order, and I'm thankful they did. I got the Ray Ray and it was delicious. Tender, smoky, full of flavor, yum! 
The beer was also delicious. I got the Oktoberfest and an IPA and both were great. This restaurant is pretty far from me but I will most definitely be back. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Quiet little brewery/restaurant. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Amber Ale is soooo good!! I come back for it multiple times. The food is also really good. Delish!"}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff, large variety of their craft beers - most are excellent! Staff will lead you to the right one for you. Pizza is great, jalapeno bombers even better, but jambalaya is to die for!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were delicious, service was friendly. They have delicious pretzel bites, Rueben sandwiches and burgers. Their house Bloody Mary was spot on and the hubs was a fan of their beers. We felt totally welcomed with our two toddlers in tow."}
{"text":"I had the Pastrami sandwich, and it was delicious.   SMBC cure their own Pastrami.  I've had Pastrami in New York, Chicago, LA, and other places, and I have to say, SMBC Pastrami is one of the best I've tasted.  I definitely will go back.  I am very happy that SMBC is not far from my home."}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.  Burgers, fries and onion rings are top notch ans hot.  Waitresses super great and kind.  Great atmosphere.  Yummm"}
{"text":"Normally I would give the food here a solid 3 stars. Average to slightly better bar fair. The locally brewed beer is 5 star. Today is Veterans Day. I am a combat wounded Vietnam veteran. My wife and I were invited here by another couple to observe this day with good food, good drink, and good conversation. After we had completed our meal and sampled a few of this restaurant's fine brews we were enjoying a pleasant conversation and although we had closed out our ticket we were considering ordering an additional brew when we were approached by a restaurant employee and asked if we would leave. We were informed that the restaurant was extremely busy and that they needed the table for other customers. To their credit, they did offer us a little miniature growler of beer to get us out of the restaurant. In a way it did remind me of my time in the service when I was often reminded to \"eat up and get out of my mess hall\". It is good that you all have so much business that you have to literally push your customers out the door. You probably won't miss mine."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Estrella Mountain Ranch 54 weeks ago from New Mexico. This was the first menu I found that had something with green chili. Then it was the Green Chili Platter. We met Laura and Jacob, the owners, that very night.  We do not get to enjoy Saddle Mountain as often as we would like, but it is a diamond in the rough. BTW my favorite dish is now called the Pork Verde Plate. The staff are the most welcoming, friendly, and attentive. Everyone of them make you will feel like you have been a life long patron. Celebrated my birthday in October with our new neighbors and had a great time while the Spirited Lads played. Families are welcome and the bigger the better. Do yourself a favor and go for a meal and an extraordinary craft beer. You will not regret your choice."}
{"text":"This place was great. Good food, good beer, attentive waitstaff. They had a live one man band when we were there, he was surprisingly good!! I enjoyed his music. 
  I'm not usually a craft beer kinda guy but both of the beers I had were good. The little lady got some strawberry (or something) beer and she liked it too. The food was good, I do believe I had a pizza and the Mrs got a burger on a lettuce wrap. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food (cheesesteak sandwich and spicy burger) was good. Beer (double IPA) was good. Service was good. Gave a military discount which was nice. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for the dessert and drinks and they are delicious! Little on pricy side with the drinks tho. The donuts are excellent! The brownie is cool too with the ice cream but I like the donuts better!"}
{"text":"Great American food. Clean restaurant with a fun atmosphere and friendly staff. Kind of hidden but worth the trip"}
{"text":"This place is great. So many breweries have one good beer, but this beer list is solid all the way through. The stout, amber and IPA were especially good. The IPA was perfectly balanced.
We then ordered the mouth on fire burger which did not disappoint! It was SPICY and sooo good. Perfectly cooked too :)

I love that you can see the brewing equipment through the windows. They sell and fill growlers (even those from elsewhere). The space is really beautiful and I love that they have fresh herbs growing in their planters.  There is lots of outdoor sitting AND heaters for the winter. My only complaint was that our dog was not welcome in the outdoor seating. 

The staff was kind and attentive for our lunch. I wish we lived closer so we could come more frequently!"}
{"text":"Driving through AZ on the way to Sedona and yelped nearby breweries, Saddle Mountain looked promising so decided to check it out. Great decision! Loved the decor- it's a throwback to vintage, Tuskegee pilots. Great decor, fun finishing touches from the metal basket light fixtures to the pipes running through the bar. Had the pleasure of talking with one of the owners and she let us know of some great upcoming collabs with other breweries. Coming from San Diego we know and love our beer so this was a great stop. Food was tasty, we sampled bison burger, yum! And Goodyear pizza, both solid choices. Shout out to our server Trevor for quality service and good convo. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Will be back on our next drive thru!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had all year!! Tasty, juicy, awesome!!! The atmosphere was friendly and lively. The beer was ok but the the burger was too good for me to notice."}
{"text":"I have to go with a 3 star rating. THE GOOD- The Clan destine Scottish was a really tasty beer so kudos to that. THE BAD- Ordered the fajitas which arrived in a teenie tiny skillet that would fit in Barbies dream house kitchen. The portion was pathetic. I opened my tortilla which was the size of a steering wheel. I just had to laugh because it would take 4 skillets to fill one tortilla. If want good local brewed beer its worth a visit. If you want to eat I would suggest you skip it. Great beer without great food us just a 3 star for me. Pick up the game in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Very busy night, the sliders were excellent and a lot of choices for beer. Service was good, beer was cold, restaurant a little too small. I'll definitely return"}
{"text":"Was told it is owned by a fellow military vet. Love the decor. Nice selection of beer and the food is great too. Good service, clean establishment. If you're looking for cheap, suggest Auggies a couple doors down."}
{"text":"This was our go to when we were in town last month. The day bartender on weekends is awesome!! (I seriously wish I remembered her name) and she made the experience!!! Every person we talked to was friendly, the beers were great, and the food was also on point. Sunday football is fun and the breakfast sandwich is seriously a must try! Wish we lived in Phoenix, this would be our home bar."}
{"text":"Been going there about once a month or more. Always good food (try the Triple-B burger - AWESOME!), good beer and wine selection, and great service. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, nice atmosphere, nice to have a place like this on the westside!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here. I was happy to see the crowd. This place is turning into the place to be in the west valley. We had the Thai chicken wings which were very tasty and the jalapeño bombers. They were a bit too hot for me, however the Italian sausage and cheese were a neat touch in them. Then we shared the Bison burger. That was sooooo good! Huge portion so easy to share. 
Our waitress was not very attentive, however the manager or possibly an owner? Came over and took great care of us. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very Good Craft beer, it's nice that Goodyear has a brewery that it's locals can go too. This brewery and 4 peaks brewery are really good. Good Check them out!!! It's must go to stop. The food is ok but the beer is what is on point here."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad comments about places but some of the staff were just standing around.. I ordered the bison burger it was very under seasoned, my boyfriend got the Ruben and said it's sauce was very flavorless and he is a guy who can eat by only ate one half of the sandwich and stopped. We had the brownie for dessert that was ok. It was very pricy too! The drinks were good our waitress did know about the different beers. I don't think we will eat here again though."}
{"text":"This place is always slammed. More of a mature clientele. 
The servers do their best, but it's slow.
The beer is fantastic!  If you bring in your ticket stub following the baseball games, you can get a $1.00 pint.
The food is just so-so.  It's actually not that great.
It's a nice place, but we only come here after the spring training games."}
{"text":"The place it self is cool I liked it.  I like all this kind of industrial,  hip, vintage bars.  I didn't eat so I'm not sure how the food is.  The service is ok like most of the bars.  Their drinks I think they are good.  What I didn't like is the \" sparkling lemonade\" because it's literally just the lemons from the soda machine mixed with a little sprite soda.  Buhhhh ... they should called it \" fountain lemonade\" Instead..."}
{"text":"Terrible Terrible Terrible...this place better pick up their customer service and having patrons get their own beers makes it worse.  Went here on 6-12-15 stopped in at 1:30pm walk in it says \"Wait to be seated\" their were like a whole 10 people in this place waited 5 min to be seated then waited 15 minutes to give our order...then our great waitress Hailey never brought us our beers we ordered we saw the guy poor the beers waited like 5min never saw a waitress so my wife actually went up to the counter and picked up our beers and our waitress never noticed or said anything.  The food is marginal at best very vanilla and unimaginative we had the fish and french fries, chips and salsa, and chocolate brownie all with poor taste the beers were decent wouldn't eat here again that's for sure.  Overall the service was terrible never had to go get our own beers before what a joke we wont be back good luck keeping the doors open."}
