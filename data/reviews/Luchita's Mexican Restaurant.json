{"text":"Lotsa expectations, hype was built up by reviews of other yelpies! Unfortunately I have tasted better mexican food in other smaller cities of Ohio. Chele Releno was not even close to what I had expected. Quesadialla was ok. Bland guacamole, salsa was the only good thing I tasted. Flan was not very rich and creamy as I had expected. Camarones Borrachos was passable. Tasted the cactus for the first time and it wasnt as bad. 
I'm not going to go back for more.
Staff is extremely friendly and nice, 5 star for good service."}
{"text":"Unpretentious decor with solid tasty and well priced food."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food at a good price.  Good margaritas, great combo plates, quick and friendly service...what more could one want?"}
{"text":"If you want great Mexican food and the best Margarita's west of Cleveland then you have to try Luchita's Mexican Restaurant in Elyria. Across from LCCC.  The food is great, service is friendly,great decor and the Margarita's are to die for.  I just hate to try any other Mexican because they don't even compare to the standards the Luchita's Elyria has set.  Tony runs a great restaurant and has a staff that cares about each customer.  Try it, you will love it!"}
{"text":"We love Luchita's! It's our corner spot and the prices, portions and service keep us coming back- a lot! Either in the dining room or at the bar, we have a wonderful time every time. Their food is traditional and we're in love with their salsa. We enjoy most of our experiences at their bar, but have enjoyed dinner there with the family at the tables. It's our go-to on nights when we want to have something healthy and fast."}
{"text":"Great Tacos! Reasonable prices. And the margaritas are on point too!"}
{"text":"I will most likely come back here.  The service was great despite them being super busy and understaffed.  The house made chips and salsa were excellent.  The salsa was a tiny bit spicier than standard Mexican restaurant table salsa--Beardyman and I both liked this.  It was by no means spicy salsa--it just had a bit more than nothing.
He got the beef fajitas.  I was impressed.  The vegetables were not overcooked and looked like they had actually been seasoned.  He said that they were the best fajitas he has had since we moved here (aside from my home-made ones of course!).
I ordered the ceviche.  What they brought me was not actually ceviche but it was alright.  There was a generous amount of shrimp and calamari, fresh tomatoes, and lots of lime juice but it was all drenched in a sweet tomato sauce.  I wasn't bad but it wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered ceviche.  The menu description of the ceviche didn't mention the tomato sauce.

We will definitely be back.  I liked that they had ten or so veggie options including salads, fajitas, and burritos.  The vegetables appeared to be well seasoned and not overcooked which is a rare thing among the mediocre Mexican fare that NEO mostly offers."}
{"text":"Excellent guacamole, though I'd add a little salt. Salsa and chips (gratis) will have wide appeal, fresh and flavorful, if mild. Frozen margaritas and sangria both very good. Seafood quesadillas only slightly above average, but chipotle shredded chicken with chorizo and avocado fajitas are exceptional. Good service, pleasant dining room. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this cute little restaurant. Walking in, there was surprisingly more seating than the place leads on. We started with the guac with goat cheese, which was amazing. We also ordered mojitos, which were very well made. My fiance ordered the Burro de Tabasco and i ordered the the Tinga de Pollo. Both were great with plenty of food. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is 1. The service is slow and 2. The chip bowls are tiny. Give a girl a bigger bowl of chips! Especially if ordering guac as an appetizer. I felt like they were having to refill it every 5 minutes it was that small."}
{"text":"\"Mexican inspired\" is more accurate. The salsa was good, the service was bad. The entrees were mediocre and what we ordered was soggy. Asked for No cheese on the entree, it came with plenty of cheese. 

The atmosphere has promise, but the execution was lacking. I can't recommend this place, as much as I'd like to. If they had better servers, and a better kitchen it might be a destination."}
{"text":"If you love bland over priced Mexican  American food you'll love this place. The service was good they had a nice selection of tequila. However the menu was very disappointing and very over priced.  They did not have any options for people who love spicy food. Most of their sauces tasted like sweet marinara. Pretty much any other cheap Mexican joint would be way better.  And really the only authentic Mexican place in the area is taqueria ranchero in Akron."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for Mexican cuisine. We eat there or get it to go. Always quick and always delicious. From the molé sauce to the \"Pick Two\" you just can't go wrong. Can't comment on the drink menu but the food menu has something for everyone. I'd give it a five except as much as I love guacamole I dislike onions. And their guac is full of onions."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating here due to the great reviews, but must have caught them on a bad night.  Sat down at 8 pm and no server appeared for at least 20 minutes, not even a glass of water.  Finally ordered and food took 30 minutes to arrive, and it wasn't very busy.  Empty plates ignored for another 20 minutes, never offered to refill our drinks, and then I had to flag down my server for my check to make a 9:40 movie.  Food was better than average, service terrible, Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"And the Server spake, saying, \"First shalt thou take out the Holy Groupon. Then shalt thou count to four, no more-no less. Four shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be four. Five shalt thou not count, neither count thou three, excepting that thou then proceed to four. Six is right out. Once the number four, being the fourth number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Groupon towards thy server. who, being naughty in my sight, shall redeem it.\"
We showed up with a party of 3. Groupon denied. \"We are very strict\" says the server. Needless to say we will come back, redeem our Groupon (with a party of four, no more, no less) and never return again."}
{"text":"Stopped  in for a drink prior to a concert at Blossom. Wow, fantastic  tequila selection. Bar staff friendly and engaging.  We tried two flights. Both were good. Good presentation of the flights. Did not eat so can not grade the food. The chips and salsa were average. A MUST GO PLACE IF YOU ARE INTO TEQUILA"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed.  

The chips and salsa were nothing to write home about.  The chips were bland and a bit stale, while the salsa was bland, as well...damn near tomato water with a couple flecks of green herbs.  When we got a refill on the chips and salsa, I noticed that the bowls of salsa are filled and kept on a tray, uncovered, on a shelf behind the cashier's station.  That's kind of sketchy to me.  

I ordered the Mexico City Tacos with steak.  They were tasty enough, and the portion (3 tacos with 6 soft corn tortillas) was very good,  but again, the corn tortillas were very bland and dry.   The refried black beans (aren't they supposed to be pinto beans?) had a strange taste, and the rice was just OK.  

The service was very good.  Our waitress was on top of everything and my glass was never empty...a sign of a good waitress!  

I was puzzled by the hostess/bartender (it was tuesday night) when, despite the very light crowd, she sat our part of 3 at a table that would have been perfect for 2.  There were lots of 4-tops available the entire evening, so I just thought it was strange.

In all, for the average prices on the menu, $14.95, I guess I just had higher expectations for this meal."}
{"text":"Not very good service. I paid 15 dollars for \"chicken fajitas\" and there was hardly any chicken on my plate. Don't get me started on presentation. It was horrendous. Wouldn't recommend to people who love Mexican food. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Although a different owner, food appears to be the same outstanding quality as the Lucita's on west 117th street. Of Cleveland.  The wet burrito is just to die for!  If you really want to be cool, order your burrito xmas style with half rojo and half verde sauce.   This is a term they use in the south west where I worked for the food network on some shows a while back.  I should also mention that I don't drink alcohol so food is my only focus."}
{"text":"I've been coming for years.   Many times driving 50 minutes across town just to get their world famous \"wet burrito \" Xmas style (red and green sauce).  This place is as authentic as you can find and thank god it's here!"}
{"text":"Great place. Been going forever. Don't be afraid to explore beyond taco Tuesday, however great deal, also great meals!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! 

I have been coming here for years. The restaurant itself is a little run down and its kind of out of the way, but the food makes it all worth it! I live 45 minutes away and I make the trek to this place every month.

My favorites on the menu are:
Enchiladas with both mole sauce and red sauce
Burritos
Guacamole
Green Salad (nice dressing)

Their refried beans, chips, and salsa are also all delicious. 

I've been to mexico, and this food is as close as you can get!"}
{"text":"We just had a very mediocre meal with very poor service.  I feel that we wasted our time and money.  We are all (a table of 7) very sorry that we chose this restaurant for dinner.  We should have known not to stay when we walked in the dining room and saw how dirty it was."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Luchita's, and have been to ones in differing locations in the city, many times. Last time I dined at the Ridge Road location, a friend loved her tortilla soup. Hubby happy with his choice. I ordered what a patron at a neighboring table had, a steak quesadilla. Not on the menu but they would accommodate.Tasty but way overpriced as I saw when I received the bill. It was in the mid-teens for a large tortilla, some steak strips, and avocado. We had some of their fantastic salsa left on our table, in our small bowl as well as in the serving carafe. I asked if we could take the salsa home. Was told from nervous server that we could purchase it. (By the way we didn't request more in hopes of doing this, we just had plenty left over.). Asked same question from manager/owner. Same reply of we could buy it. Was told by him that he could reuse the salsa that was in the carafe. Apparently state law permits that. The carafe's design is very slender on the top; a patron wouldn't be able to stick a tortilla chip into it, but still...yuck! I don't want to eat someone's recycled salsa. Manager/owner was rude to boot. Haven't been back. Will only patronize the 117th location from now on."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is a good deal for mediocre tacos. Buy a drink, and then get $1 soft or hard Tacos.

Overall Ok place. I'd certainly go again on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I'm really confused about Mexican Food in Cleveland.  I'm not from Texas or something- I'm from Atlanta.  I can't find a good Mexican spot here to save my life!  Maybe the folks at Luchita's are from some place in Mexico that doesn't have a population in Atlanta or anywhere else I've ever been.  Maybe it's fusion.  I need to be clear with all y'all on this one- I hate fusion.  I hate it.  If I'm going to a fusion place let me know and don't go calling it Mexican if it is like whatever kind of fusion it is.  I don't like Luchita's.  It is pricey.  I don't even know what the menu is trying to offer me and I think maybe I've just been so disgruntled by the entire experience that I am unable to put words together to express my disdain for that which is Luchita's.  The outside made me hopeful.  No.  I have no hope for Luchita's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood spots. Still wondering why it took me so long to try Luchita's, glad I finally did. Queso Fundido, Enchiladas, and Guacamole a la Cabra (I think that's Spanish for goat cheese deliciousness). Friendly down-to-earth staff and bartenders, strong drinks & pours (keep the Herradura flowing), and amazing food. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I have been to Luchita's many many times and have recommended it any time Mexican food comes up.  The food is great, service is great and fresh made (not from a gun) margaritas are the best.  Always a good fun crowd on either side.  I strongly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic Mexican food.  My personal favorite is the Burrito Mojado.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT here!!! Terrible service!! Management...including owner was incredibly rude. We are even investigating the restaurant because our credit card information (as well as one member of our group) was stolen."}
{"text":"I love the authentic Mexican cuisine! I have had the fajitas which look nothing like our American Mexican cuisine! They come with a red sauce & wedges of tomatoes= delicious! I have also had, I can't remember the name, but it is a fried I believe enchilada? And it was puffy and delicious! They have their own recipe for margaritas! 5* on Shaker Square!"}
{"text":"This place is small and cramped. The food tasted good, but the cleanliness of the establishment is questionable. The bus boy dropped the washcloth on the floor, then picked it up and began wiping tables down. 

They also refused to honor my Groupon voucher on two separate occasions - the last time at the discretion of the manager even though we followed all of the rules in the 'fine print' from the website. 

One part of our order didn't come out until we were done with our meal. Then, the waitress literally asked us for a large tip (we gave 20%) because she said that she doesn't make much money and that we shouldn't take it out on her as the waitress just because they wouldn't take our voucher (we wouldn't!)  

This was a terrible experience! I'm not likely to return."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of Luchitas from the late 90's and, with the CLE food scene booming like never before, hadnt been since that time.   Just too many other great options around.   So, when I saw a Groupon offer pop up that offered an additional 25% off the already 50% off rate, I thought it was a no-brainer.

I'm sad to say, I think Luchitas best days might be behind it.   

While there was a respectable crowd there on the early Saturday we went, the place had multiple open tables.  As soon as we weere seated and were handed the menus, I thought \"oh oh\".    The menus handed to us were stained in multiple places and the plastic sleeve the paper menus were in were cloudy and smeared, as if someone took a cloth and tried their best to clean them.    Looking over at the tortilla chip warmer, several large buckets of industrial cleaner were stored.   Nothing wrong with that, I guess, but could they not find a space in the back?

The special $7 guacamole tasted store bought with a few goat cheese crumbles scattered over it while the queso fundido bubbled in a 2-3 inch layer of chorizo grease.    Beef in a taco also tasted old.   Refried beans that accompanied my Pollo con Crema tasted \"off\" and/or rancid.   

Drinks were ok, not great.   The Golden Margarita was acceptable while the Sangria was just simply awful.

On the good note, the chips and salsa were very good and the server did a great job.  

No need to ever return - even at 75% off."}
{"text":"I love Luchita's. I've been going there since I was a kid, and the servers remember me and say things about how grown up I am, and ask about my brother and parents. 

I've been all over the world and this is still one of my favorite places. I am shocked to hear about cockroaches (and think they are on top of things enough to fix that problem), but frankly, I'm still going to go. Maybe cockroaches are the special ingredient that makes the green sauce and salad dressing so tasty."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and a half to eat sub-par, pricey Mexican food. I hated the taste of the tortilla. My taco was wet from the grease of the meat, so it was basically inedible. The wait staff  weren't  very helpful....only came to check on us once. The guacamole was good, just too expensive. I thought it would come with my meal free as a side, but when I got my bill they charged me for it! An extra $7 on top of the $13 taco plate. Definitely not worth the money or time....I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Service was fine but the food was overpriced and not so good. I had steak fajitas. Meat was too tough. The rice had what appeared to be small peas that were most likely frozen and dehydrated, not fresh. I'm sure everything like the re-fried beans was from the can.  They would do good to lower their prices to better reflect the lower food quality."}
{"text":"Luchita's is definitely different than other Mexican places around. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad. To the lady complaining about the burrito, the menu perfectly explains what you are getting: \"a flour tortilla filled with your choice of shredded chicken, shredded beef, ground beef, refried bean, or vegetarian, then topped with melted cheese.\" It's not their fault you were expecting something different. If you look up traditional burritos, that is how they are made - flour tortilla, stuffed with meat or beans. Just because everyone is used to chipotle's burritos being filled with whatever your heart desires, it does not mean that's what you're going to get at an actual Mexican restaurant. (If you do want a big burrito filled with lots of stuff, they have one, too.) Luchita's is definitely a little more \"Americanized\" than other nearby restaurants but I prefer it. I don't feel sick when I'm done eating there. If you really want authentic Mexican, order some of their specialty dinners. Luchita's is one of the few restaurants around with chiles rellenos and empanadas. Delicious."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice and attentive.  Margaritas were delicious.  But unfortunately the food, no bueno."}
{"text":"Great service, authentic Mexican fare with awesome margarita's .. Food was very good, Natalie was attentive and very genuine as our waitress.  Would come back again in a heart beat.."}
{"text":"Meh...

The menu is meager but the drinks are good.  Don't order the chicken enchiladas as while they ARE shredded well, there are no onions or peppers in the middle and NO seasoning, just lots and lots of dry-ish pollo.

The red enchilada sauce is peppery and pretty bad tasting.  They even *charged* us 50 cents for some in a small cup for the kids to dip their chips in and it was too spicy anyway.  Nice! :-/

My fajita chicken salad was quite good, actually.  The refined beans as other reviewers pointed out are VERY good, but the rice is from a bag and bland and even borderline undercooked/crunchy.  A message to the owners: authentic Mexican rice (visit allrecipes.com) is VERY easy to make with like 6 or 7 ingredients and takes about 30 minutes!!  NO EXCUSE for using a pre-prepared or bagged mexican rice mix.

The guacamole was also good, but overall our meal was over-priced for the food they were serving - and the service itself was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Small little place with friendly staff. My husband and I stopped by on a Saturday evening about 630 and it was busy but we got sat right away. 

We shared a pitcher of gold margarita. It was small so we each had 2 glasses. The chips were ok nothing special. The salsa was good! Had a little hear to it. 

The queso fundido was amazing. I would come back just for that!

I had chicken enchiladas that were just ok and my husband had tacos de Cameron. He really enjoyed his. 

Overall we would come back!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Cleveland from LA, I've been searching for good Mexican food. Luchitas is about the best I've found so far. I heard great things about so had to try it. Atmosphere is good, margaritas are fairly strong, the food is good. It was two months ago that I ate there so honestly can't recall what I ordered food wise but I know my table of four had a great time and left full. I will return."}
{"text":"I went there last night and we asked for margaritas on the rocks. Very sour for my taste or I would have had more. Maybe if you specify one of their 100 tequila options it might have been much better. I ordered a beef burrito. It was literally hot seasoned ground beef in a tortilla. Nothing inside at all. I would have expected cheese, lettuce, vegetables, etc. I suppose the cheap price prohibits making it a really good option. I am guessing that there are better items on the menu. If you told me I have to go back and have the same items I would definitely pass. The saving grace was that the server was friendly and prompt. Kaetlyn did a good job on ensuring we had everything we needed. It is a pretty small dining area and loud so probably go early or later if you want a relaxing Mexican food kind of dinner night. If not, prepare to eat and leave. Not a good place to relax and have a few cocktails. Thanks"}
{"text":"Best margaritas in Cleveland. The atmosphere at the bar is nothing but fun. Food is good as well, but go for the atmosphere most of all."}
{"text":"When you first walk into Luchita's you will get a seat either in the front or the back. If you sit in the back you have it coming for you. The acoustics in this room makes every conversation loud. The staff here is rude. The food is overpriced. After eating here I did not feel so well. When I woke up the next day to stomach cramps and headaches told me that I should never go back."}
{"text":"Omg I like this place. Strawberry margarita that I got here was so yummy, but my favorite here it was Ceviche. I was looking so hard for a good Peruvian food and this mexican place got it."}
{"text":"I am almost hesitant to write this becasue I don't want it to get too crowded. First, when it originally opened, it was bad. Overpriced, bland, the works. However, with the arrival of a new part owner and a revitalization of the menu and prices, it's become the best Mexican restaurant in Hudson. The chips and salsa are delicious, dollar tacos on Tuesday are a must have, and the atmosphere is fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was good portions and was delicious, but Bar service was pretty bad. Bartenders stood there and talked while we waited 10 minutes to be served drinks and another 15 minutes to order food"}
{"text":"Luchita's offers very good Mexican food at reasonable prices -- and for Cleveland, that's saying a lot!  (I was spoiled by living in Chicago for 35 years prior, where there are plenty of authentic, gourmet Mexican restaurants.)  The ambiance is comfortable and real -- does TGIFriday's HAVE to set the standard for restaurant decor in Cleveland?  And the service was warm, attentive and homey, which added to the enjoyable dining experience we had at Luchita's.

The empanadas were delicious -- light and NON-greasy, with flavorful fillings.  Green salad ordinary/undistinguished.  Flautas crispy and good, not great.  Sopa Azteca was tasty, a step up from ordinary, but not outstanding.  I had Pozole de Puerco Estilo Michoacano as an entree and it did not disappoint -- a more authentic dish with an excellent array of flavors, also a very generous portion.  My friend had Filete al Chipotle and gave it a B+: meat a bit tough, but ancho pepper salsa made up for that.  We were stuffed but shared an average flan for dessert, and it was plenty large enough to serve two.

Very glad to say I could wash everything down with my all-time favorite brew, Negra Modelo -- yummmm!

Note: we learned that all four Luchita's locations are independently owned and operated (by various family members), so food is not necessarily identical or equally good everywhere.  The 117th St. location is alleged to be the most direct descendent of the founder of Luchita's.  Try it -- you're unlikely to be disappointed (speaking of which, we had previously gone to the nearby Mi Pueblo and had a universally BAD meal)."}
{"text":"Before my most recent visit, I would have given Luchita's 4 stars for sure.  I've been here many times for lunch and have always had good service and good food.  I especially love their chicken tortilla soup and amazing salads.

I stopped in for dinner last night during happy hour, and again had good service and good food.  However, my disappointment was from the bait-and-switch specials advertised on their website.  It says $.99 beef, chicken, or veggie tacos on Tuesdays and 50% off appetizers during happy hour.  It turns out that the Taco Tuesday deal is actually 3 tacos for $6, 3 taco minimum, must all be the same.  And the \"veggie\" tacos are refried or black beans.  When a Mexican restaurant says \"veggie,\" I am thinking peppers, onions, etc. because they usually say \"beans\" when they mean beans.  Not that the taco deal that they offer is a bad one, but it's significantly less of a deal than what they advertise on their website.  And the appetizers are discounted for happy hour, but not by 50%.

I've been a loyal repeat customer of their Hudson location for years, and this probably won't stop me from returning, but it certainly lowers my opinion of their establishment."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I have high hopes. And every time, I leave disappointed. Our service was good, but - the food just has no flavor. I feel like I need to add salt to it, and you should not feel like that when you are eating Mexican. I usually end up filling up on chips and salsa, and those are decent. They also make a pretty good marg there. It will be awhile before I go back."}
{"text":"Go for drinks and chips and their queso dip. Skip the food - average at best. No flavor, nothing special. This is our conclusion after about 2 years of sporadically eating here."}
{"text":"Well, I just left after sitting for 15 minutes without even an acknowledgment from any of the numerous servers much less even taking a drink order. During that time, I watched literally every table around me receiving drinks and food, two of which were seated after we were. I began to wonder if I was invisible. Needless to say, I left and went across the street."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Friday evening dinner. Service was slow throughout and the food was sub-par. Drinks came out about 15 minutes after we ordered them (2 beers, nothing fancy). We ordered and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. My wife ordered a vegetarian dish but received a chicken dish instead. I ordered the Tequila Lime Pollo and it was served over tortilla chips. The first few bites were okay, but it quickly became too salty and the chips like mushy cereal because of the soupy consistency of the dish, which was unexpected. Our server said she'd removed my wife's dinner since it had to be remade. It came out in a reasonable amount of time but our server took a long time to come back to us to check in before we could report the error, not to mention I was about finished with my dinner when the remade dish came out. Upon receiving the check both dinners were charged at full price. I asked if she said she'd removed my wife's dinner charge but the server was referring to the erroneous first dish. DUH! Of course we aren't paying for the incorrect item. Anyway she proceeds to tell us she'll see if she can take 50% off the dish. Upon returning she informs us it's the restaurant policy to give a max of 20% discount and asks if that's okay. 

Overall a poor service and dining experience. We waited too long for drinks and follow up on drink refills. Also our server may have been new / seasonal, but she shouldn't have first offered to remove the dish from our check then to offer 50% off, only to realize policy dictates 20%. Luchita's is okay for afternoon beers and chips at the bar, but I won't be back for food."}
{"text":"We visited Luchita's on a Sunday evening and enjoyed absolutely everything we ordered as well as the service and atmosphere of the restaurant.

The building just has that vibe of being a well kept secret... An authentic Mexican food/dive bar in the heart of the west side. 

I ordered a piña colada frozen margarita and absolutely loved the texture and taste of the drink, a steal at $6. We also ordered the goat cheese guacamole to start. At $7 it seemed like a small portion, but it was delicious and looks can be deceiving... We had PLENTY left to put on our burritos when they arrived. We also had a Groupon for $26 worth of food, so we figured why not.. Live it up.

We split a large shredded beef Chimichanga and a large combo with 1 pork burrito, 1 chicken burrito, and a cheese enchilada w/ mole sauce. EVERYTHING was so freaking good! The burritos were STUFFED with meat, the chimichanga was the best I've ever had, and the mole sauce was also delicious. Honestly, I feel like reviewers who didn't like their food didn't get the right stuff. Our food also took around 10-15 minutes to come out, no wait at all.

Thank you Emily & Ashley for great service, we will be back!! Especially for enchiladas and margaritas on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Had the Chile Rellenos great taste and I'm picky. Friendly and hospitable staff who made me feel very welcomed. Great atmosphere, Cindy has a very friendly personality. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good Mexican is tough to find in NE OH. This place is mediocre at best. Mole sauce is awful. Waitress warned us to get it on the side because it's sweet and most don't like it. Boy was she right. Salsa is very good and guac is ok."}
{"text":"Luchitas is hands down delicious! I'm always there for Taco Tuesday!! The staff is extremely polite and always doting on you while you wait for your food. The food.. omg.. the food! The cheese, the meat, the sauce!! It's all amazing. I could sit there and simply eat the chips and salsa for days. Love this place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Luchita's is closed on Sundays! I have only been here once (shocking, I know as I am a major West Side stalker). I enjoyed a great margarita (or 2 or 3) with a good friend over chips. I think we ordered dinner too, but mostly I remember having a great time and the margaritas. 

It wasn't totally easy to find parking."}
{"text":"My fiance and I bought a Groupon for Luchitas. We got there and it was 99 cents taco tuesdays to our surprise. So we didn't use our groupon. It was very busy and they keep their staff running! The tacos were all good but the soft ones were the best. Chicken was a bit bland but I can't complain for the price. Definitely the best taco Tuesday around town. We also bought a side of rice and beans to split. The portions were generous.I am glad I still have my groupon so I can return back and try some main entrées."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Service great in the bar area. Needed more sauces with entrees though."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good Mexican food for being in the Midwest. I like their chips and salsa. The mole sauce is pretty good. The tortillas they use are not freshly made and they are American tortillas, which makes a huge difference in taste. I don't like their rice at all. It has a funny taste to it. it almost tastes like it stored in plastic bins , I taste some kind of weird plastic or chemical in the rice every single time I go. I don't think they cook the food fresh to order because it comes out of the kitchen so fast. 
The blended margaritas are very good. I am Mexican so my Mexican food standards are high. This place is just ok."}
{"text":"A great little Hispanic restaurant tucked into an old rough neighborhood bar in a very questionable part of town. There is no way I would have gone there on my own, but some friends highly recommended the food, so I met them there for dinner. The margarita I had before dinner was so good I had to have a second one with dinner. I asked the barmaid what was in it, but I guess it's some sort of a state secret because she just smiled and said something I couldn't understand in Spanish even though she had been speaking perfect English moments before .  
I had the rojas and verde chili rellenos for dinner, and I'll admit it was outstanding. My friends were certainly right about the food. I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in town for business."}
{"text":"Food was bland this time around.  Beans were tasteless.  Fajitas did not come out on a sizzling plate and the chicken was lukewarm.  Margaritas were very sour.  Los Jalapeños and Cozumel can run circles around this place.  I think I am done with it."}
{"text":"Nyaa....so so.   I bought carry-out.  Enchiladas and burritos.   The food lacks authenticity in the ingredients.  The chicken choice was chocked full of chicken meat, but a little dry and just tasted like a wrap with lots of chicken, no taste of ingredients that we've all grown to love in Mexican cuisine in other places like Chipotle.  Maybe the eat-in menu has better taste, but looking at the prices combined with the mediocrity of the carry-out food, it doesn't appeal to me.  Oh yeah as I was waiting at the bar to place my order, the order taker instructed to take the chips and salsa away from me stating that I didn't need it???  What's a Mexican place without chips and salsa???  An Italian restaurant??"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in at least 10 years but I was in the neighborhood and my boyfriend wanted to try it out so I figured why not as I knew I had seen them on groupon earlier and could get a good deal,boy was I wrong about that! The server took forever to actually greet us and much longer to get drinks out and finally take our order but we were somewhat ok with that since was getting a little busy in there. I found out they charge you .50 for each (very small) bowl of chips or salsa you get which is a total joke!!! I go out to eat Mexican quite often and have never been charged for such a thing but whatever not I huge deal. However the food was not even good,had little to no flavor on any of it, The final straw came when we went to cash out using the groupon I had purchased and they said we couldn't use it because we each got a taco as well as our meals and apparently they were on special that night so because of that they wouldn't take my groupon at all towards any of the meal .The manager came over and just said your taco was on special so NO and walked away. Needless to say I was upset and I will never go back there again and wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing groupon for that place because obviously they will find a way to not take it and you'll be out extra money ... Thank god there's always Nuevo in North Olmsted,that's the place to go if you're looking for amazing food and service totally worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Greatest Margaritas in Cleveland!!!  Kind of small but very quaint!  Great service from the whole team!  Great pricing!"}
{"text":"There's this list floating around Facebook with the top taco places in Cleveland... and Luchita's was on it, so I had to give it a try. 

It all starts with the salsa, which was delicious. We weren't given many chips, but the hostess was very willing to bring over more. I had a beer and ordered the chicken fajitas (pictured.) I always feel that fajitas are a safe bet when trying a restaurant and Luchita's did not disappoint with this meal!"}
{"text":"Used to be great.  My first few trips here were simply glorious.  Sadly it has become just awful.  The food and the service have just dropped off.  I have not been in a couple months.  Perhaps they will get their act together and bring back some flavorful food.

P.S. the chimmys are always cold in the middle now. :("}
{"text":"Luchita's is absolutely amazing. They have the BEST margarita flights and we are never disappointed with our meals. I highly recommend for any occasion, and the patio is lovely!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some Mexican food.  It's hard to find shredded beef, as well as chimichangas, but this place does both so I'm sold.  Great cheese sauce, chips, and a hint of spice in the salsa.  Very inexpensive, great food, and amazing service."}
{"text":"Luchita's has been good to me in the past. But tonight was different. We rolled in about 8:40, just for some beers. When a friend was hesitating when deciding whether or not to order food, (kitchen closes at 9) the bartender provided helpful insight. \"If you order food under 10 minutes before the kitchen closes, the chefs will spit in your food.\" We laughed at the age-old joke. But she insisted on making us grasp the reality of the statement. \"No, seriously they will really spit in your food because they get here at like 8am and when it's time to go they are really ready to go.\" I of course, decided not to order food. And every bite of salsa I took tasted just a little gooier. Otherwise she provided really amazing service."}
{"text":"Be ware of any Mexican restaurant reviews that start with a rave review of the chips and salsa.    I see that often for Mexican restaurants that get high yelp ratings based on the cocktails and chips and salsa. 

This place has very mediocre Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex food.  The staff was friendly so I can give them a third star but really if your going for the food its just  average and more of a two star."}
{"text":"first time in dining area, seated in bar area last year - sat down with daughter to eat while in Hudson-went with intentions of spending money!  Seated where 2 other booths were finishing up - no one else in area but us.  TEN minutes to get asked about beverages.  Finally came back to get order, I asked about childrens menu; saw it online but not in menu given - sassy in telling me there wasn't any and its just a la carte items - the tone and attitude from young waitress killed my appetite - got kids ques for daughter - tasted like the ones I make at home, nothing Mexican about it.  Never asked what I wanted, never gave more chips or salsa, didn't refill drinks. Her ques came in 2 minutes, but not worth the $3 - had to go to cashier area to pay, never came back.  Never going again.  Sad, LOVE mexican food.  Get better staff.  Salsa good, chips needed salt."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a number of times...but I've yet to experience it!  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they're clearly doing something good for it to always be full...  That being said, however, it's not hard to fill this place up because it's ridiculously tiny.  The bar is a decent size but the number of tables is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Best house made margaritas ever!!! So fresh tasting and lime filled! Mojios are good as well. Freshly made in house packed with mint! Good is another story. Like most places for Mexican you get your chips and salsa upon arriving. Salsa kinda on the spicy side but good. Great weekly food speicals! Tuesdays they have 99 cent tacos, chicken,beef, or ground beef. Soft shell ,hard or my favorite the mexicano where the stuff the corn tortillas and deep fry them! Yummy!! Meat was a little on the dry side but good. Service was ok. When came in they were packed. Had to wait 15 minutes for a table but hey 99 cent tacos why wouldn't they be packed!"}
{"text":"Don Patron is my new go to place for Mexican food. The management of Luchitas should frequent their place and see first hand what makes then successful - from the top down. I'll only visit Luchitas if I'm walking downtown and want to get a drink.  Luchitas bar is much better but that's where it ends."}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight and it wasn't even busy. Waiter who was actually really nice took order then we didn't see her the rest of the night. Only 1/2 of our food order was delivered. Had to flag someone else down to get the rest. Nobody checked in on us. 3 employees including a manger spent the whole time cleaning the bar so they could leave for the night. Clearly ownership and management issues here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a one star because this by far was the worse Mexican food I have ever eaten. When I think of Mexican food I think of rich and hardy tastes. This place served me burritos with only the meat inside of them and nothing else. When have you ever eaten a burrito without any lettuce, tomatoes, sauce or anything else other than just plain meat?!
By far the most boring and tasteless Mexican food I have ever been served at a restaurant - EVER!!!
I don't recommend this place at all, and if you're going to try and argue that it's authentic Mexican food, then I would say if it's authentic, then it's from the boring and tasteless side of Mexico. Save your money and go to McDonalds before you spend it here, it will actually have more taste than the food served here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Used to go all the time to the Shaker Square location, but sadly they closed. Great food delicious magaritas and fabulous servers!"}
{"text":"IF you want to know anything about a Mexican restaurant's food, start with its salsa.  If a restaurant can pull off making a great homemade salsa, you can count on everything else falling into place.

I sit here in Washington, DC...367 miles away from Luchita's...and a week removed from the wonderful dinner I enjoyed there last week.  STILL, I am remembering my evening there along with their spicy & delicious salsa.  Yes, I have a good memory, but I am also having their salsa as I write this because it is so good I bought a quart to bring home with me!

Really!  The food is delicious.  I ordered the small combo of a beef enchilada and pork burrito.  Both were fresh, hot, and tasty and served with a nice rice and beans.  My date ordered the Rajas con Pollo.  She very much liked her dinner and paired it with a salty margarita. 

The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the owner, Eduardo, came to our table to inquire of our visit.  I confessed to him that his prices are too low.  Our dinner was cheap by both DC and Cleveland standards.  We had a pricey dinner at a celebrity restaurant the night before our visit to Luchita's, and I got to tell you...I wish we had visited Luchita's instead of the other place.  Everything about Luchita's was more inviting.   Both Eduardo and our waitress, Sam, made us feel welcome and comfortable.  We had a wonderful evening at Luchita's.  I am sure you will too."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Florida. Ate at Luchitas and was pleasantly surprised after seeing the negative reviews. The food was delicious, just good basic Mexican comfort food. Margaritas were excellent. I liked the Luchitas nachos. The wet burrito was good, just a little salty. Margaritas were excellent. Also appreciated the inexpensive $2 kid meals (my kids like cheese quesadillas which really do not cost much to make). Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the Nachos Luchitas - amazing platter full of all the meats and the cheese is perfect! Add some habanero sauce (ask for it) and its perfection. Portion is so large you will have leftovers."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago !! Food was insipid !! Shrimp fajitas were cold and didnt even taste fresh !! We had a bad experience with the cooking per se and service was very mediocre !! The dinning area looked dirty and unkempt !! They did not meet my expectations !! I have had much better mexican dinning experience in other places !! Would not recommend it !!

{"text":"My fiancé and I went to dinner at Luchitas last night.  I had the Puerco and couldn't have been happier.  It reminded me of my time living in Hermosillo. The pulled chicken flautas with green salsa and media crema made me smile they were mildly sweet, fresh, and flavorful.  
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The customer Service is fine, the Decor lacks expression and the food is the most saltiest food I have ever eaten!!!!!!! It saltier than the OCEAN!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, skinny girl margaritas are where it's at so you can use most of your calories on the stuff that matters like chips and dip. The guac is 'you need a fork because your chip is going to break its so chunky' good. I had the veggie enchiladas which I highly recommend. The only reason this place gets a 4/5 is because I only got two enchiladas and another time I got three."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but the food was de-li-cious. Friends say that it's the most authentic Mexican restaurant around. Their portions are good and I crave their refried beans...

Little fun hole-in-the-wall joint. I went when I first moved to Cleveland, so in my mind, it's a Cleveland staple.

It was a little hard to find parking -- had to park in the side street. That's my only complaint."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Luchita's this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We ordered the crabcake appetizer and the nachos.

The crab cakes were delicious. They were served alongside a bed of salad which had a sweet-vinegar dressing that complimented the crab cakes perfectly. Really, really good. We had originally tried the crab cakes at Taste of Hudson, and loved them, so we definitely wanted an order of those.

The nachos were fantastic. I am not kidding, they were some of the best nachos we've ever had. Big crispy tortilla chips piled high with a really tasty blend of shredded cheeses, chicken, sausage, refried beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream and guacamole. We couldn't finish it all. I wish we could - it tasted so good. The chips were nice and crispy, perfect amount of salty-ness, and the cheese, chicken, beans and sausage were served bubbly hot, and topped with tomatoes and cold sour cream and guacamole. Perfect blend of crispy and creamy, hot and cold. Excellent! 

Our server was very nice, and we were seated pretty quickly for a Friday night. They were very busy, and the place seemed pleasant and clean. Had a \"fun\" vibe ... Lots of people talking and laughing .... Multiple TVs on in the bar area with various sports games on.


Overall, we really enjoyed our meal, our service was good, and the environment seemed clean, up to date, welcoming and happy. 


We will absolutely be back!  :)"}
{"text":"So, this is a place to grab a quick bite of Mexican food. The food is decent: Not great, but not bad either, Although it does come out of the kitchen surprisingly quick, which leads me to  believe, as others have said, much of it might be microwaved. It doesn't matter. It's good for what it is. As for the service, it's mediocre at best: Half-interested on a good day, subtly hostile on a bad one. As for the music, I don't need to hear \"If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony\" while I'm eating a plate of burritos with my family. Get real. Maybe I'll return."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the shady exterior.  Enter and you will be pleased.  We sat at the bar and had Tecate while we waited for our table.  Once seated we over-indulged in chips and salsa.  The salsa was very fresh and had a nice kick to it.  Bean burritos where great and the rice was nice and fluffy.  The best part was the margarita made with Patron tequilla...or mabye when our friends picked up the tab.  (Thanks guys- not necessary!)
Only one minor complaint.  We got there at 7:30 and the place was crowded.  We were seated, ordered drinks and I started in on one of my long-winded stories.  The waitress came over twice in 5 minutes.  Honestly, my stories are great and I didn't want my friends to miss any of it.  The constant interruptions disrupted my momentum and the story was lost in translation.......!!  I can appreciate the fact that she wanted to turn the table, but after we finished eating at 9:00 there where quite a few empty tables."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife because she heard the Margarita's were good. I had the enchiladas while she did the drinking. The food wasn't bad but it's not great. I would come here again to it, as it's not a really fancy place but it's close and the staff is very polite. I would like to come back again and really dig into the menu, then I might go up on the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants, and Luchitas is one of my favorite. The food is always fast, flavorful and reasonably priced. Some of my favorite dishes are the pollo tinga, the tacos Mexicanos and the flautas. It's hard to find a restaurant in this category that can deliver such fast service while maintaining fresh, quality ingredients. Luchitas does it.  

As for seating, I'd recommend the bar - which has several large, flat-screened TVs perfect for watching games - or the patio, which is a casual, sun-drenched area. 

Lastly, I have to mention that the skinny margaritas are the best."}
{"text":"Despite the hype, Luchita's seems like below average Mexican food at best.  I mean honestly, where's the flavor here?  

Chips?  Bland.  

Salsa?  The only good thing on our table.  A little runny for my taste but good enough to smother the taste of bland chips.

Guacamole?  Green, bland paste.  Needed something to punch it up.  More garlic, maybe?

Beef Tamales?  90% masa, 10% beef.  No bueno.   Sauce was decent but a little tangy. 

Beef Tacos with Beans and Rice?  I had to smother my tacos in salsa because the meat was bland and a little overcooked.  My rice tasted like it came straight out of an Uncle Ben's rice box.  The beans were terrible--black paste with no flavor.

My husband had the tilapia fish tacos and while things were edible there were just no reasons to expect great things from this establishment.  I'd say go here if you don't have a choice, or don't care for flavorful food.  My recommendation is to drive a few blocks to Mi Puebla."}
{"text":"We went to Luchita's at around 8 on a Thursday evening and there were almost no other people there which really surprised me. We were seated right away and brought chips and salsa immediately. The salsa was delicious! I wish the chips were warm but that's being a bit nit-picky since they were still crunchy and the perfect vehicle for the salsa. We also ordered queso dip which had large chunks of tomatoes and veggies in it for a nice thick consistency.  While we decided what to order, we got a pitcher of frozen margaritas... We opted for a mango strawberry swirl which was very sweet and refreshing, not to mention beautiful! For my entree, I ordered shredded chicken flautas which came with a side of rice and refried beans... Definitely makes for 2 meals as the flautas are enormous and there are 2 on the plate! They are nice and crispy on the edges and soft in the middle, and the guacamole is excellent (very creamy).  I didn't care for the beans... A little too sweet for my taste, but the rice made up for them as it was very flavorful.  By this point I was completely stuffed, but someone decided to order the fried ice cream for our party to split, and honestly it was the very best part of the meal.  The presentation was lovely with fresh fruit and drizzled chocolate and caramel around the plate, and the dish itself was everything fried ice cream should be; crisp on the outside with a beautiful shell around a ball of creamy vanilla... Heavenly!"}
{"text":"I am sorry. I have never written a review like this before, but feel I need to now. This was the absolute worst dining experience I have had in many years (and I eat out several times a week.)

Arrived at 10pm and were told before anything else, the kitchen closes at 10:30, okay fair enough. So we quickly order drinks, appetizers and entrees. 

I was driving, so I asked for s Coke.  Not a flat Coke like I received, but a regular Coke. My wife ordered a pomegranate Cosmo, but what she got was basically a couple shots of \"well liquor\" with a drop of juice. It was completely in drinkable.  Vodka is actually my favorite liquor and I could not take more than a sip of this turpentine.  I mean, it was the absolute worst drink I have ever had. 

Next, our entrees arrived, (notice there is no mention of our appetizers yet.)  I had ordered a \"slow cooked shredded pork\" meal, but what I got was a big chunk of pork that I needed to saw through. The flavor was nice, but it was not slow cooked or shredded. 

After a while, our server was walking up to random tables with our appetizers asking if they had ordered them. Eventually she made it to our table and we just accepted them. I ordered a \"puréed\" chipotle chicken soup (which sounded amazing on the menu.). What I got was a tomato paste with chunks of chicken so big, I had to cut them with a knife and fork. 

When the meal was through (with very little actually eaten) we asked for the check. We were told ONLY THEN, that they could only accept cash OR would have to WRITE our credit card information on a piece of paper to have processed later. Now look, I have been in the financial industry for over twenty years, (15 of which was credit card specifically,) I understand the likelihood of my number getting out is basically non existent and I am fully aware of the zero fraud liability policies of banks, so I don't care if they publish my account on the Internet (which obviously they wouldn't.)

The problem I have is, they waited until the end of the meal when we had no other choice.  It was a poor decision made to avoid losing business. In my opinion, it was nothing less then deceitful. 

Lastly, as we were leaving the restaurant, we saw how filthy it actually was. The floor of the dining room obviously have not been vacuumed at all that night and in the middle of the vestibule, there was a pile of dirt, a dust pan and a broom that looked like it was just let drop there. What was missing, was someone actually cleaning. We have no idea how long these things had been sitting there, but it was filthy. 

In short, I will absolutely never return to this establishment and consider it an embarrassment to First and Main in Hudson."}
{"text":"I My veggie burrito tasted like a mcdonnalds  breakfast burrito and my husband said the chicken tasted like turkey!  We will stick to our Dos Coronas in Macedonia"}
{"text":"Before moving to my home just hours away from the Mexican border, there was Luchita's. Man is this place good!! Authentic food (which is rare, lemme tell ya!) and Margaritas delivered to my table by the pitcher?? YES PLEASE!!! Parking can be crap, so be warned for that, but otherwise skip Taco Hell, skip that Chipoltle crap and run, don't walk, to Luchitas!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing from another yelper regarding cockroaches, I'd say to PASS on Luchita's. I can no longer give them the benefit of the doubt. It seems the cockroaches have been around much longer than just a few months. The cockroaches will most likely hang around Luchita's and will remain there... even after their doors are closed."}
{"text":"fair margaritas (if you order the premium ones), below average food.  Nothing at all like the original Luchita's on w. 117th"}
{"text":"Great drinks! Great Fresh Food! The waiters were very courteous and we had an amazing time! 

The entrees are quite creative! They are not the usual enchiladas, burritos and tacos u get...Try it ! Great taste!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of work colleagues for a team dinner.

Décor was nice and it had a cool ambiance, sadly that was as good as it got.

I ordered a dinner portion of ceviche expecting a traditional seafood dish with lime, cilantro, avocado and onion. Instead it came out in a thick red sauce and the shrimp and calamari were obviously not allowed to marinate in lime juice but were precooked and tossed into the ketchup flavored nastiness they called ceviche.

I tried a piece of one person's seafood quesadilla and it was inedible, the shrimp being rubbery and unflavorful. 

I also tried a piece of another's empanadas whose dough was gummy and undercooked.

No one of the 7 of us finished our meal.

The service was good but they really need to do something about the horrific food."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican in Cleveland. 

- Friendly wait staff / bartenders
- Good and pretty cheap drinks
- Some of my favs:
   - Chicken Quesadilla
   - Chorizo/potato chimichanga :)
   - Cheese stuffed pablano peppers"}
{"text":"When we came to OH 14 years ago we were starving for Great mexican but willing to settle for good. The original Luchita's on 117th was a scary looking place but the food was SO authentic. UNfortunately, the Hudson franchise is nothing close. 

While the room is much nicer looking than the one on 117th, the food is VERY disappointing. The enchiladas were limp and soggy yet the chicken tasted very dried out. The guacamole is very pasty and was browning from sitting around too long. Unless you want to pay too much for a premium margarita, you get something that must come from a machine and tastes like any other chain. Beyond their control but the bees in the summer always make sitting outside a huge hassle."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? For starters, the food is mediocre, AT BEST. Nothing is very flavorful and my enchilada came out smothered in shredded cheese from a bag, as well as the cheese inside. I could have made it at home in my own microwave.

Also, I was verbally accosted by a family who clearly had too much to drink sitting next to me. The woman personally attacked my friend's appearance, simply because we had given them the stink eye ( they were tickling their 3 year old incessantly, causing her to shriek very loud.) That is fine if they want to go home and carry on like that, but I personally do not want to be seated at dinner having to listen to a shreiking child and witness horseplay. They then attacked our age and simply because I am in my early 20's assumed I was in college. When I told them I was not even in college, they told me maybe I should be. I graduated two years ago....

Getting off topic, the man whom I thought was the manager on duty turned out to be the owner and stood back and did nothing when he found out what had transpired. No apology, no comforting to my crying friend, NOTHING. It was obvious that just because we were younger meant no respect or empathy. 

When I had gotten home and called him to express my concern at his lack of diffusing the situation, he told me there was nothing he could say and next time he would \"try to be a better person next time.\" I'm smart enough to distinguish a condescending and patronizing tone when I hear one and believe me, his was one of them. 

Needless to say, I will not be going back. Ever."}
{"text":"the food is ok and the portion of the food in my opinion does not match the price.  I got the rajas con pollo that came with only two tortilla for $15. i was still hungry afterwards and received more food for less than that at other Mexican restaurants.   i went to the diner on clifton the next day i got 4 nice sized pieces of french toast, enough egg whites ($1 extra) to make an omelet, and a nice portion of home fries all for just over $10.  Needless to say i was beyond satisfied. This latest experience made me remember why i had not been to Luchita's in years."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Friday and the place was empty so we were seated right away. The service was fast and the food was good. I ordered the chicken fajita salad with the sour cream and guac on the side with the house made dressing. The salad had such good flavor from the chicken that I didn't even need any dressing on it. I wished I would have gotten the taco salad ( my mom got it) because the chicken fajitas made my lettuce a little soggy so I primarily ate the chicken, which I didn't mind because I stuffed my face with chips and salsa before hand. My moms salad looked bomb and she said it was awesome. 

We ordered a pitcher of skinny margaritas, which were flavorful and strong. 

The chips were ok- nothing special, but I enjoyed that the salsa had a little bit of a kick to it. We also ordered an bowl of guac, which was good but a little too chunky for my liking. It also seemed to have chunks of lettuce in it which I found odd. 

I'm giving this 3 stars because I adore Mexican food and will always compare it to chipotle, \"dirty Mexican\" restaurants and my favorite Mexican place in Charlotte. I would come back here, but I wouldn't crave it or have it as my first suggestion for Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"Always avoided based on the terrible reviews and the fact that I'm not a huge fan of this cuisine. 

Our children raved about their tacos from the Taste of Hudson outdoor food fest. We brought them back as requested.

Parking is tight at the First & Main development but we lucked out in finding a front spot. 

Inside we were seated immediately in a large open dining room, that was stylish, they had some cool lighting at the bar area, something that fascinated our youngest child.

We were seated but waited a while for chips & salsa, something the hostess could have easily grabbed off the open shelf next to the hostess stand.

The menu is very small, something I like, as most Mexican restaurants have pages and pages of endless options. Here they keep it rather simple.

Our server was friendly, knowledgable of the menu and was great with refills, couldn't ask for better service.

The chips were tasty with a very mild salsa, perfect amount of salt.  Only to be enhanced with a queso dip that was perfect.  It was even served in a big appetizer bowl, a plus as it's annoying when other places give you a tiny little sample dish.

I had a Tacos Mexicano ($13.99/Sept 2013).  Three tiny crispy taco shells with a choice of chicken or beef.  Both meats were shredded. The dish was a big lop of lettuce and completed with rice and beans.

In general, I liked it, especially as someone that doesn't like the traditional mom & pop Mexican joints.  The kind that occupy some former fast food joint or a former Denny's and the kind that try to hide the B & C health grades on the windows.  This place was immaculate.  Very clean, not too fancy but not so simple that you couldn't entertain friends or business colleagues. 

I'm rounding up and giving a 3.5 review a 4 as I think they put in a good effort and they're stuck with reviews from folks that like the typical Mexican joints that I would hate."}
{"text":"The other reviews are all true. Food is great, but service is one of the worst. We walked in and felt unwanted and ignored. Finally got addressed and seated and didn't have our waitress come back to attend to us for a LONG while, even though she walked past plenty of times. We tried to grab her but were unsuccessful. She eventually came around and we ordered drinks & food together (since we waited so long). When the food came out we still didn't have our drinks. She said the bartender was slammed but it felt like the waitress just forgot to pick them up. That stunk cause we had to sit around after dinner for a while trying to finish our drinks vs enjoying them during the long wait. Some food details were wrong-she blamed the kitchen not herself. 

Bottom line: food good, skinny margarita delish. However, you can get that elsewhere with genuine service and an establishment that's excited to have you as a patron! This is Hudson, they need to get it together cause it's a prime location in the heart of the area!"}
{"text":"Rating this restaurant one star may be too generous. I went to Luchita's in hopes of a nice, relaxing lunch; however, it was just the opposite. The service was horrendous, the management may have been even worse, and the food was sub par. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks and even longer for the food, all while we were one of the only tables in the restaurant. At one point we actually walk around to try to find service. We were then overcharged for our meal with no compensation or even apology when brought to management's attention. I would not go back to Luchita's even if it were the last restaurant in the world. 

*also, the guacamole was reminiscent of cement*"}
{"text":"Not much to look at and the area is is not the heights but the food is really exceptional. Luchita's has been around forever and for good reason."}
{"text":"Disappointed! I've heard for years that Luchita's is arguably the best Mexican in Cleveland. I have tried many Mexican restaurants and enjoyed most of them, so I was looking forward to my 1st visit with my family to Luchita's. I was surprised to find Ceviche on the menu, so I ordered it for an appetizer and was really excited about that. At every Mexican restaurant I go to, I typically always order the Carnitas for the entree, so I did just that. First, the Ceviche ($10) came out in a cocktail glass as some sort of dip. I was looking forward to a salad. Very disappointed! Second, my Carnitas came. It was swimming in a pool of watery sauce on my plate, with a side of rice and refried beans. It tasted like it was boiled with very little spices or marinade. Very bland. I am used to the baked/fried carnitas that are crispy in some areas. Very bland. Very disappointing. My wife ordered the chicken fajita salad and she said that the chicken was also very bland. Overpriced and terrible food. 

The only positive things I can say is that the space and location is nice, the wait staff was nice, and the kids menu is cheap. Other than that, we won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"I love me some good Mexican food. Being half Puerto Rican, I think my standards are pretty decent in this regard. I like some semblance of authenticity, but keep an open mind that things end up \"Americanized\" to make it more appealing to the masses. 

I tend to find that \"hole in the wall\" establishments are the best. This place is no exception. The neighborhood this divey restaurant is in is dicey at best. Definitely a little unnerving in the evening times. If you were to judge this place at \"face value\" you wouldn't go in. The building is not at all attractive and looks more like a corner bar from the outside. But, momma always told me not to judge a book by it's cover.

I bought a Groupon to this place and boy, am I glad I did. What a gem! The inside is huge. Honestly, you'd never guess it from just the outside view. Well, that and the fact they have like 10 parking spots. The parking sucks...just being honest. So, if you come here when it is busy, expect to park on the side street. But back to the inside....the decor in here is pretty cool. It is well maintained and is definitely clean. Clean is like number one for me when I review a restaurant. I do not care how good the food is, if it is dirty, you have lost me. Plenty of seating to accommodate large groups or just a simple one on one date. The menu is simple with the typical Mexican fare. Nothing crazy out of the ordinary. We came right at 3 and placed our to go order. Within 15 minutes we were on our way to Edgewater to enjoy our little picnic.

1) Chicken burrito ala carte: This burrito was definitely on the larger side but very very simple. Definitely a more traditional burrito. Lots of shredded chicken, a nice soft tortilla and plenty of yummy and bubbly cheese. Simple flavors that just plain work!

2) Chicken fajita dinner: I am a fajita-aholic. I love fajita....and this dish definitely didn't disappoint. Lots of yummy veggies, tender and juicy chicken and just the right amount of spices and flavor. The veggies were cooked perfectly too. Not all soggy and gross....just enough bite! The fajita dinner comes with pico, refried beans, guac and Spanish rice. I will break these down one by one:

a) The pico was super fresh and full of flavor. I could tell this stuff was hand done and I love the amount of cilantro they used. I could eat this stuff as a side on it's own. 
b) The refried beans have to be some of the best I have had. Again, simple yet effective flavors. They are cooked perfectly too. Nice and moist and not at all greasy. Topped with some yummy cheese that is broiled to a nice bubbly brown.
c) I absolutely loved the guac. I cannot say enough about the flavor of this stuff. It was perfect and definitely fresh. Another thing I could eat as a side on it's own!
d) Spanish rice is a hit or miss at most places. This place is a hit. Perfectly cooked (not soggy, not hard) and just the right about of flavor. Some places serve you bland and soggy rice. Not here. This stuff was right on point!

The bartender who took our order was extremely friendly and willing to accommodate my request for hot sauce put in a small container. Made the time pass by fast by talking with us and getting us some water. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Luchita's was a huge disappointment. The food quality was very poor.  I ordered tacos and chicken fajitas.  My 6 year old held up her taco and said , \"mommy look.\" grease was pouring out of the taco so much so that her plate was filled with grease. I showed the waitress by picking up the taco as more and more grease poured out. In sheer disbelief she said nothing and walked away.  Trust me Taco Bell is a hundred times better!  On my way out after expressing to another waitress how bad the food was' she said \"they just didn't drain the meat.\" Poor quality food, poor service."}
{"text":"Luchitas is located on Cleveland's near West side in a rather rough-looking building that seems to fit well within the confines of the surrounding neighborhood. It's old school Cleveland at its best. Upon entering you'll immediately notice that it's laid out like a typical bar/restaurant with the long bar to the left and the main dining area around the corner to the left, separated from the bar. It's not that large and I wasn't all that impressed with the digs. It seemed a bit tired, outdated and just a little sticky. So let's get the party started, shall we?

Having purchased a deal on Groupon we ordered from the prix fixe menu. Here's the rundown:

Flight of Empenadas - A selection of four beautifully fried and crispy delights. Golden brown pillows  each filled with a different selection of goodies: chicken and cheese, cheese and potato, ground beef and chorizo and potato. These were the highlight of the meal for me.

Sopa Azteca- chicken broth, shredded chicken, rice, pico de gallo, avocado. I was not at all impressed with this dish. It was a bit on the bland side and it reminded me of something I've had before out of a red and white metal can. Meh.

Ensalada Verde-lettuce, tomato, bell pepper,onion, cilantro, queso anejo. Not a bad salad if a tad boring. The lettuce and veggies were fresh and crispy.

Flautas de Barbacoa de Pollo - Here is another gem from our meal. These things were like crispy bbq pork cigars. The Mexican cream, queso fresco and salsa aguacate were great compliments to the crunchy flour tortillas.

Pork Tacos- A trio of tacos topped with onions, cilantro and pineapple. My wife really liked them and I guess I found them pretty good, too. I wasn't a fan of the pineapple in the mix, but overall not a bad dish.

Filet al Chipotle- I should know better than to order steak at a Mexican restaurant. I have yet to find one that doesn't completely destroy the meat. The steak strips in this dish were as tough as leather. I felt bad for the cow. The onion, potato, cactus, chipotle and ancho pepper sauce wasn't quite cooked enough for my taste (some of the taters were a bit on the raw side). I think the best part of this dish were the refried beans and white rice. 

Luchitas sure seems to have its fair share of loyal followers in Cleveland, but I have to agree with some of the less than satisfied Yelpers on this one; I just didn't get it. For me it was a rather middle of the road experience with the highs and lows pretty much cancelling each other out to wind up right at the center of the bell curve.

Having lived in Texas before I've had some rather spectacular Mexican dishes. Don't get me wrong, I'm no expert in Mexican cuisine (or any cuisine for that matter) and I'm not saying that Luchitas isn't authentic, I'm just saying that after reading some of the other reviews on here you'd think it was the greatest Mexican food on the planet. I had very high expectations for my visit and, unfortunately, they finished just shy of meeting them. Among the bright spots was the service, both friendly and relatively attentive (got a bit slow toward the end of our meal). I certainly couldn't say it was the worst I've ever had but I'd be hard-pressed to find a reason to get my butt back in one of their seats anytime soon.

P.S.
Stick with bottled beer if you imbibe here. I had to send back a Great Lakes Dortmunder. Tasted like dirty draught lines to me. Ugh."}
{"text":"Consistently great food, inconsistent service. 

A friend of mine told me about this place, and my husband and I fell in love with it. I've also introduced this place to many of my friends and they love it almost as much as I do. 

Let's start with the food: 

It's amazing. The table salsa is fresh, delicious and has an amazing flavor. The enchiladas will knock your socks off, and the black beans are out of this world. 

Ordering ahead and getting food to go is hit or miss. Many times I've not checked my food before I left, got all the way home (it's a 20-25 minute drive) and it's not even what I ordered. I definitely check my food now. 

The service... is very inconsistent and you either have a great server, or they're absolutely terrible. I bear through it because of the food, to be honest. Tonight's service was terrible, and I never got a refill on my water, or checked on when my food was ran. It's also not even busy, so I'm not sure where my server has been all night. Lol

4/5 for the food."}
{"text":"Visited Luchita's today with Groupon Prix Fixe, which I didn't see before I bought it.  Pozole de Puerco Estilo Michoacano basically were chunks of dry pork with hominy, which was bland. Tinga de Pollo- shredded chicken was tasty. Soup was luke warm, Mexican salad was small but fresh and tasty.  Empanadas and flautas were very good. Restaurant is old and outdated - nothing to write home about.  Probably would not go back.  At $29 plus $8 for side of guac, drinks and tax for 2 dinners this was not really a good value (stated value was $58.35)"}
{"text":"Extremely sub par Mexican food, cheap but not worth the money. Burrito was basically the same as the enchilada and stuffed with tasteless shredded chicken. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great little bar that serves Mexican food on the edge of the West town neighborhood. Menu is fairly extensive but nothing out of the ordinary. Our server was Fernando who was great and made our evening pleasurable. Margarita pitchers are 17.00 which get you about 5, 5 Oz glasses. Not a bad deal. Most of the menu is written in Spanish so be prepared to bring your Babelfish translator. Place is fairly clean. Chips and salsa portion is rather small. Hostess looks like she is 14, let a group behind us get seated ahead of us. There is no hostess stand. You simply have to find someone who looks like they work there. We sampled several items from the menu and we're pleased, although the tacos are fried not served soft as you might expect from a real authentic Mexican place. Again, it is a bar first and foremost."}
{"text":"I've long been a fan of the Luchita's on W.117th. Although it appears to be a bit of a hole-in-the-wall, don't let the looks fool you! The food is excellent! Last night, my boyfriend and I went to dinner. We were seated immediately and the waiter who took our order was very nice--checking in on us, but not hovering (this is a big thing with me). I ordered the tacos el camaron--usually I order the enchiladas with half red and green sauce, but decided to try something different. I'm so glad I did--the tacos were DELICIOUS. The tortillas were perfect, not soggy at all, the shrimp was generous and soaked in this sauce, which I can only describe as tart, slightly spicy, and a little citrusy. Topped with lettuce, pico, and avocado, I could have easily eaten all three (although I'm glad I have the leftovers today). The dish came with a generous side of black beans and rice. I also ordered the silver margarita, which was very good--not overdone with sour mix or triple sec. Pricing is definitely reasonable, my entree was I think $14.25 and margaritas are about $6. There is a little parking lot across the street, which is nice, but if you cannot find a space, you have to street park, which is kind of pain but not the end of the world."}
{"text":"An adventure trying to park. Once we got in the place was cozy. Pulled up a seat at the bar to avoid the wait. Used a groupon certificate and ordered of a different menu than their normal one. Many delicious samplings. Guacamole sampler, cactus salad. Yum. Margarita on the rocks was raw, unrefined and tasty. Didn't realize such a gem existed in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tried Luchita's for the first time yesterday. I was super excited because I. Love. Mexican. Walking in I was very surprised how small it was;however, I never made it any further than the first table where we were seated and there's another room with more tables. 

I don't think it has your typical Mexican restaurant vibe, but again I only made it to the first table. Next time I will take a look around! But overall the atmosphere was cool.

As with any Mexican restaurant, or at least with any I've been to, you're greeted with chips and salsa. I've had a lot of chips and salsa and different restaurants and I can honestly say without a doubt that Luchita's has the best salsa I have had yet! It's enough for me to take the 20 minute ride just for some chips and salsa. Which by the way you can order to go!

I decided to stick to water but my friend ordered a margarita. It was $6 and pretty small but tasted well according to her.

My friend's boyfriend has the queso fundido which he absolutely loves...enough to not want to share!

Being my first time here I wasn't sure what I wanted so i decided to go with the combination ($10). I had a chicken burrito and a beef taco Mexicano with the rice and beans. Rice and beans were pretty average. The beef taco Mexicano was ok, definitely helped to have the guac and sour cream but was tasty. I was highly disappointed with the chicken burrito. It was simply shredded chicken in a tortilla with melted cheese. The chicken was poorly seasoned. I ordered fresh jalapeños to add a little flavor and kick to it. In hindsight I should've ordered that salsa to smother it in. 

I will return. Definitely for the salsa! Maybe to explore the menu at least once more."}
{"text":"Luchitas was known for bringing REAL mexican food to the Cleveland area.  Now their menu has been americanized a bit to cater to all of the families that visit their restaurant with young childeren.  

The Hudson location has a nice bar and excellent service.  If you can come during the week, there are some nice bar specials.

The salsa is great but the rest is similar to any other Mexican restaurant.  I gave it 3 stars because the friendly staff does a great job. The food only warrants 2 stars."}
{"text":"The bar tender was polite, but the food was sadly terrible. I tried a little of everyone's food that was in my party and I was extremely disappointed because it was all really bad. I would go back, but only for a drink at the bar. Mi pueblo blows this out of the water. I hope the other location serve better food."}
{"text":"Have been going to Luchita's for many years and have never been disappointed. I tend to go for the same meal but it's so guaranteed to be good each time that I can't steer myself away from the Cheese Enchilada dinner. Service is friendly, however, dining alone, (and this goes for almost everywhere I eat alone), there seems to be some stigma for the solitary diner. (I've said this in another review). Nonetheless, there is no reason that I can see that I won't return to Luchita's. I will make one siggestion, being Mexican-American and having eaten in restaurants throughout Texas, etc., why don't you just offer up a side plate of flour tortillas with the meal? I recall asking for this at Nuevo Acapulco and they looked at me like I had spat on the table...c'mon, this is my heritage and we ALWAYS had tortillas available at the house and in most Texas Tex-Mex places. Just a thought....I mean how else do you want us to collect the sweet juices from our food that accumulate on the plate?"}
{"text":"Drinks were ok, food didn't look that appetising (but then again, did just return recently from Mexico)."}
{"text":"I've had better salsa and mexican rice elsewhere.  The chips weren't warm, which is one thing I love about Mexican Restaurants.  The enchiladas however--yum!  Very delicious.  Not the cleanest place, so that's why I gave it 4/5.  Parking could be much better, and the stairs leading out the door are very hazardous.  Otherwise, good place."}
{"text":"Barely greeted by hostesses that seemed occupied in their own conversations upon walking in and later in the evening experienced the owner of the restaurant yelling at an employee for a mistake they had made. A mistake that easily could've been a learning experience but the owner blew out of proportion in front of my partner and I and made a FOOL of himself. I will never spend another cent there and there are more authentic Mexican restaurants in Streetsboro."}
{"text":"Si, señor! Luchita's is muy, muy delicioso.

First of all, the service was enough to make this a ten star experience. I have no idea how anyone has had anything but amazing service here, but all I can say is, hells yea. 

Secondly, the never-ending, stuff-me-to-death, awesome bowl of chips and salsa didn't hurt. I loved the texture and spice of the salsa as well. Some may argue that it's not the \"best salsa in Cleveland\", but I say, shut it. It's freaking tasty and I finished at least two bowls by myself. 

Third, hello margs in my face. The bartender asked us what kind of tequila we'd like and filled those suckers up! I mean, so strong that you could have probably lit my breath on fire. Hot damn. Combine that with super-swift refills and you have one bubbly, tipsy blonde. 

Our entrees came up super quickly and we both really enjoyed them (see also: stuffed ourselves to oblivion.) The beau had this tasty, shredded chicken dish with a spicy, cream sauce with warm, flour tortillas for wrapping. Although, I just snuck fork-fulls--shhhhhh! Being the indecisive gal I am, I settled on a combination plate of ala cart items. Jason wanted a tostada, and I got a cheese enchilada with both red and green salsas and a beef, Americana taco. Everything was pretty typical, but the salsas were bomb-diggity! I also get a little taste of the sopa, which has inspired a recipe hunt so I can try to make something that yummy at home.

The restaurant itself was very clean and organized, although, yes-- it's dive-y. It really gave the place a local feel and I didn't mind it at all. We saw families, folks on dates and people grabbing take-out. There's certainly something for everyone here."}
{"text":"My boss gave me a gift card for Luchita's as a graduation gift when I completed my master's program. I was super excited to try it since she raved about it and a few other people had told me great things. Needless to say I wasn't too impressed. I ordered the beef empanadas and my sister ordered the pork with onions. In my opinion the food didn't have that authentic Mexican flavor and lacked a lot of seasoning. Another thing that kind of bothered me was how quickly the food came out after we ordered. Made me wonder if what we were getting was being made fresh... Drinks were good and service was good."}
{"text":"I saw a picture of their Friday fish fry dinner on FB and immediately wanted to get me some! I stopped by after work and since I got there before the fish fry started at 5:30pm I decided to sit at the bar and enjoy their happy hour menu while I waited. Select appetizers were half off so I got the flautas barbacoa ($3.25) and the goat cheese guac ($3.50). Both were pretty tasty, however I would not pay the full price for the guac unless the portion size was increased.   They also give you some chips and salsa (tasted a little hot/spicy to me) to snack on while you wait. Since I got my fish fry to-go and it arrived shortly after the appetizers did, they allowed me to box up the unfinished appetizers (I barely touched them). A young blonde waitress was pretty friendly and the old blonde one seemed pretty cranky. Atmosphere was pleasant and there seemed to be plenty of regulars inside. 

Now the star of the show, the fish fry! ($13). It came with two pieces of fish, chipotle tartar sauce, mac & cheese, cucumber and carrot slaw/salad, and Mexican grilled corn. YUM! The fish was fried perfectly, not too heavy on the batter. The slaw/salad was crisp and refreshing. The mac & cheese was gooey which was awesome. Overall just a very tasty experience and I must say better than the traditionally greasy fried everything fish dinner. I will definitely go back and grab this special while it lasts!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mex in the area!  Very fresh and the food is come out hot, not cold on a hot plate."}
{"text":"This reviews comes as a surprise to me as I've heard how good the food is at the Cleveland location..... at the Hudson location, not good.  The bartender who assisted with my pickup order is the only reason this has a two star review. She was very nice and pleasant.  The vegetarian burrito and vegetable enchiladas on the other hand were not. The green sauce came out of a can about 15 seconds prior to being put on the food. The waxy cheese covered mushy corn and I believe flour tortillas.  Vegetarian at this location means I hope you like peppers and onions because that's all your getting.  We are fans of good guacamole and have heard there's was good so we tried it--- threw half of the 2 Oz we were given (for 6.99) away. 95% chunky onion and tomato, and really no flavor.  If the 4 people sitting at a table being the only customers at 6pm on a Thursday night wasn't a clue, the food surely was a sign to avoid Luchita's. 
Sadly."}
{"text":"Spot on authentic Mexican food.  Not the kind of place where you place your order and it comes out 8 minutes later.  I gotta agree w PW about taco Tuesdays and man those enchilada's are great on Weds.  My grandmother would take me here as she lived within walking distance so this place also takes me back to good memories.  The sign out front is an icon in this neighborhood.  They are closed Mondays.  If you like Mole' then you really will like theirs.  This place is as Cleveland as Sokolowski's and should be on everyones \"Cleveland places to eat\" list"}
{"text":"Unlike most Mexican places, the rice and refried beans are vegetarian but the black beans are not!

It's a Mexican place without obvious Mexican people but the food it slightly above average and it's a little more upscale."}
{"text":"This place has great margaritas we had to wait a couple minutes for our table we had a couple margaritas which were great. The chicken mole was very good add to chicken chipotle which was okay. the place was busier than usual we will come back and try it when it's more of a casual relaxed atmosphere but the food was worth stopping in for again."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant! Enchilada night is a must! Cozy and authentic. Parking is sometimes an issue but worth the short walk.  Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"After going here numerous times, we've concluded that the food is boring and lacking flavor. Go for the queso and margaritas. Skip the dinner."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla I've had. The Complimentary Chips and salsa were really good too! The waitresses are extremely friendly! I am a frequent luchitas goer and the staff has come to me and vice versa. It's great having a locally owned place that values relationships with customers."}
{"text":"Been here twice now for their Taco Tuesday. My 16yr old son loves their tacos. Margaritas are so so...depends on who is making them. Salsa is great. Fillings on the tacos are a lil skimpy but I guess thats what you get for 99c tacos on Tuesday.  Planning to go back on a Weds for their $2 enchilladas."}
{"text":"While the shine has worn off of this place over the years, Luchita's still manages to deliver a quality meal at a very affordable price. 

There was a time when there was an impossible wait to get in, but that was before Mexican or Mexican inspired cuisine popped up on every fifth corner in Lakewood. Thus is the burden of a popular ethnic food!

Despite possible slip ups and varying quality of subsequently attempted Luchita's locations, this one stands the test of time. What you will find here is a good standard of coastal Mexican fare and a couple Tex-Mex favourites sprinkled in for the uninitiated. There are many items unique to Luchita's that you won't find elsewhere and it is definitely worth the time to peruse the menu and try something new to you."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Luchita's in years. I remember exactly why it's taken me so long to come back to this restaurant during my recent visit.

Luchita's is an authentic Mexican restaurant, you're not going to find any tex-mex dishes here. 

My boyfriend & his son both got the steak fajitas. They were skimpy on the steak that's for sure. Their were more peppers than anything. My boyfriend's daughter got the steak enchiladas & she didn't like it. The steak was too chewy. I got a steak burrito & I wasn't pleased with it. It was flavorless & the steak was very tough. 

The dinner wasn't cheap either yet, the food was pretty mediocre. The only thing I liked was the service & the chips & salsa."}
{"text":"Terrible margaritas.. both mango and lime. Terrible service. Food was awful. I'm surprised they are still competing in the Hudson foodie market."}
{"text":"My friend and I picked this place for dinner, knowing nothing about it other than it served Mexican. Everything we ordered was delicious, and our server was friendly and attentive. The place itself looked kind of haphazard and messy in terms of cleanliness, and there's only one stall for each bathroom."}
{"text":"Really wonderful authentic Mexican fare at reasonable prices. I had been wanting to try this place for a long time, and finally stopped by. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was there about a year ago. Had a glorious beef chimichanga. The food was great, but my only complaint was the service. Now, maybe it was just because we were on the patio, but we waited at least 30-45 mins to get drink orders taken. It seems our waitress may have just left mid-meal also, so we had to keep asking various people for our checks by the end of it. Good food, but I wouldn't go back.

Oh! I almost forgot to mention: one of the most disgusting bathrooms I have ever seen. There was uh, \"stuff\" everywhere. Pretty nasty."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like Luchita's.  My husband and I went many years back (15, maybe?) and remembered it as very good.  When we saw a Groupon that would save us some money, we decided to revisit it (it's a drive for us, and we chose the West Side location rather than the closer one in Hudson.)  We went to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Sadly, we found little to inspire enthusiasm.  The frozen magaritas seemed good (though expensive) to me, but my husband and his friend thought that the alcohol content was less than it should be for the price.  The food was. . .actually, a step below \"meh,\" although certainly not \"eek!\"  We ordered different dishes--chile rellenos, a combo plate (enchilada/taco/burrito), and fajitas, as well as appetizers.  The calamari was tough and much less than abundant.  (Sort of like chewing your pencil eraser, if you ever indulged in that in grade school.)  The combo items and chile rellenos were fairly indistinguishable from one another, except that the taco seemed both soggy and stale and that the chile rellenos were overly salty and too cake-y.  The fajitas seemed to include poor quality meat and veggies--my husband complained that we could have made a tastier meal at home.  We tried to improve the flavor of our food by dousing it with salsa.  We asked for the \"really hot\" salsa which was--let's say three stars out of five when it comes to heat.  

The sole good point was that our server was attentive and friendly.  (Our busboy, however, was very grim and almost depressing!)  We must hold the minority opinion about the food, though--the place was packed by 6 pm on a Friday night, and the noise level rose beyond our tolerance limit.  (We like to hear one another without shouting--and to refrain from hearing those at nearby tables discuss their battles with foot fungus, Montezuma's Revenge, and irritating colleagues.)

Even a much better Groupon would not persuade us to return, I'm afraid.  Our expectations were not very high, but I think we could have done as well at Taco Bell.  (And we don't like Taco Bell!)  Glory is fleeting. . ."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Mexican and I mean MEXICAN food!!
This place is it!!

This is a small hole in the wall restaurant/bar that isn't fancy, they don't have much art on the wall. 

But, they have amazing food. Like, AMAZING! I love Mexican food, absolutely love it. However, it doesn't love me. Unless if comes from here. 
The goat cheese guacamole is my favorite. I could eat that until I turn....Green. 

This place has got it all. Homemade chios, Salsa and actual authentic Mexican food and great prices."}
{"text":"Awful food, terrible management and atmosphere. Only thing good about this place was how lovely our waitress was.  

Doesn't even deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"For years, we have heard nothing but good things about this location. I once had a terrifying experience at their Hudson location but that is a review previously listed.

Upon giving in to try this place, we are very disappointed. For starters, the service is sub par. I mentioned my food allergy and she almost ignored it with a \"mhm\" and didn't bother to write it down nor tell the kitchen I'm sure.

The only item worth getting here is the queso, but I still wouldn't bother. We had the enchiladas. All you could taste is the flour tortilla and the pasta sauce they clearly smothered it in. A handful of plain beef and we had what looked like mexican food and tasted like Italian junk. The margaritas were from a slushie machines and taste like something you buy at cedar point.  THEY ALSO CHARGE YOU 50 CENTS FOR A CUP OF CHIPS. 

And they shoved me in the corner like Baby.

All and all, I won't come here again."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews on Yelp!, and knowing the reputation that Luchita's has, I sauntered in for dinner this evening.  The small parking lot across the street was full, and I ended up parking on the side street.  The restaurant is located in a roughly 100-year-old two-story commercial building that screams \"neighborhood joint\", and the art deco entrance was kind of funky.  

Upon entering, there is a long bar to the left, and several tables in front of you, with the main dining room behind the bar.  The walls were covered with stucco, and were fairly uncluttered, save for a colorful painting on the wall, a hat that had been hung, and a cactus in the window.  

When I arrived, only two tables were available, which was a decent sign for a weeknight.  A bowl of chips and salsa were immediately placed on my table.  The salsa had a little spice to it, but had that nagging not-homemade feeling (I could taste a bit of vinegar, which is oh-so-common in jar salsa).  

I ordered the large combination plate, which consists of your choice of three enchilada/burrito/taco/flauta, rice, and beans.  I always use chicken enchiladas as a measuring stick, so I ordered two of those with salsa verde, and a Taco Mexicano with shredded beef.  

The food easily took 15 minutes to arrive, which is a little scary when you know that components of Mexican food are fairly interchangeable, and the restaurant is not very large.  The salsa verde on my enchiladas was caked-on and bland, with none of the spiciness or tomatillo flavor that i expected.  The corn tortillas were rubbery, and the entire enchilada tasted of nothing but plain, unseasoned chicken.  The rice was garden variety meh, and the refried beans were tinny--straight out of the Old El Paso can.  More bizarrely, my taco was in a deep-fried rolled-up tortilla (taquito, anyone?), and was covered with guacamole and sour cream.  I've never been to Mexico, but I've had tacos--which are traditionally grilled meat, onion, and cilantro, with perhaps some salsa on the side.  This was not traditional, and the beef definitely had some crust on the ends.

Mexican food is supposed to be fresh and simple, and provides an opportunity for fresh salsas to shine.  Sadly, none of these were present during my meal.  Honestly, I've had better Mexican food in the middle of South Carolina.  I expect better from a longtime stalwart in Cleveland.  

The only reason I didn't give Luchita's one star was because the staff was genuinely nice.  I save one-star ratings only for the absolute worst of the worst .  I think Luchita's is just a victim of Americanized Mexican food and cutting corners.  For shame."}
{"text":"Such a great neighborhood staple. The food is consistently delicious, and the bartenders are outgoing and friendly. I really like the Mexico City tacos and I suspect they might even be slightly healthy. The chicken soup and tostadas de tinga are can't-misses!"}
{"text":"The lady friend and I were in the mood for some Mexican this weekend and decided to try this place out. I had never heard of it and nor had she. When I saw it on Yelp I thought that the atmosphere looked to be a significant step up from most other Mexican restaurants in the area and we weren't disappointed when we arrived, however, the disappointments started shortly there after. 

-No one checked on our table after we were seated for nearly ten minutes. (Not even for water or drinks and we were sitting outside in the heat). 

-Service was TERRIBLE. The wait staff checked in on us once after we received our food. Our drinks sat empty for 15 minutes. I tried to stop our waitress as she walked by and she completely ignored me. 

-The food was bland overall.

-When we were finished I had to flag someone on the waitstaff for our check, who wasn't even our waitress, who brought over the checks, then our waitress came back by to pickup the tip.

Not too sure if it was the specific waitress we had or what, but she seemed really disengaged with the whole idea of just helping us as people, much less provide good customer service. 

Really really disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst mexican food ever! I order fajitas and not sure what i received. It was not edible. Looked more like soup. The chicken was cold and way too much liquid. Looked more like stir fry with a side of baby poo. Normally fajitas come and you have to assemble them but i am pretty sure this was lartially digested already. I took two bites and could not bring myself to eat any more. Absolutely inedible!"}
{"text":"Luchita' s restaurant is in a great location on the square. We arrived about 6 pm on a Saturday. They were fairly busy but we were seated rather quickly. They have a great bar area and a lot of draft options. The salsa and chips were excellent. The chicken in by burrito was fresh white meat and not your typical shredded dark meat. The rice and beans were very good as well. 

For dessert there are several options for ice cream or yogurt on the square. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Luchita's has been around since the 80's! I used to come here as a child with my family back in the day in the 90's and it was always delicious. I remember the sign with man with the sombrero as a kid and it always made me smile and want to go back.

I've been here several times since my youth and it's always delicious! The place is on point with their Mexican food. The sopa azteca is fantastic. I love the broth with the chicken and avocado. You can't go wrong and I have to get it every time. I love the enchiladas with the green sauce and the empanadas are delicious and crispy. 

Place is great for Tuesdays also for Taco Tuesday. They have 99 cent tacos and they are a great deal. Also on Wednesdays they have $2 enchiladas.

I love coming here for happy hour also. They make a strong margarita and it's fantastic. Perfect balance of sour and tequila. It's not too sour to the point where it's gross. It's the exact right amount and packs a punch!

Service is always quick and the people are very kind and welcoming here. It's a staple in the neighborhood and just has such a cozy feel to it. It's nothing fancy but feels welcoming and I will always keep coming back and talking this place up!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Food has no flavor and they serve small amounts. You do not get the Mexican Culture Vibe. There's way better restaurants. Don't waste your time. Unless you're not familiar with real Mexican food,  I could see why you would think this place is great.  Smh"}
{"text":"Stopped in here last Saturday after another prime spot for our local friends was found to have closed or moved.  Luchita's was hopping and on a wait, be we managed to snag some bar seats.  Bartender asked the entire bar to move down to accommodate our group of four.  She was completely slammed, but had a nice routine for treating the entire bar as one big party.  Always encouraging to see someone doing things correctly in the weeds.
Chips and salsa were pretty great, which is sadly critical for us in moments like these.  We were very hungry and made the old college mistake of eating too many chips.  Food was really good despite having destroyed our appetite and we over consumed as one will do when the stars of hunger, chips&salsa, followed by well prepared meals align.  I wanted to buy a t-shirt by the time we paid.  This is the new go to spot for Mexican on the West side for me.  Regular kind anyway. You want chef power you go to Momocho,  El Carniceo, or Barrio.  I guess we could eat Mexican every time we go out, but that would leave a lot of diverse tastes unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Low key spot, flavorful Mexican food at a decent price. We brought a big group here (many arriving mid-meal) and they were very fast and friendly serving us. I ordered tacos that came in like a deep-fried rolled tortilla - different than I expected, but they hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, it's one of the best Mexican rants in Cleveland. Salsa is great, also the chicken tortilla soup. The potato-cheese chimichanga is great, as are the ground beef burritos, and chicken with mole sauce. I am never disappointed. Good food and not terribly expensive!"}
{"text":"One of THE best Mexican places on the west side of Cleveland! Claire, Ashley, Jess, and Eddy provide the best service and most authentic Mexican food you'll find in Cleveland. Highly recommend trying. The margaritas are also worth your money."}
{"text":"To say this place has the worst etiquette I have ever experienced at any restaurant, is putting it lightly.  Extremely overpriced, awful food, awful service, disgusting practices, arrogant, inept owners.   It seems it has been pointed out over and over again on this website how appalling this place is, and the horrible ways in which the OWNERS themselves handle situations.  It seems they have no respect for their business, their staff, and least of all their customers.  
Stay away; please do not contribute to keeping these scumbags in business."}
{"text":"I had the best enchilada of my life at Luchita's.  It's surprisingly hard to find enchiladas with a verde sauce in Cleveland - at least in a restaurant that doesn't make me uncomfortable with crazy decorations. Or one that doesn't cook everything in pork fat.

Overall? Good food.  Free chips and salsa.  Fast service.  Lots of vegetarian options.  More margaritas than one person could conceivably drink in one sitting. It's definitely worth checking out.  There are multiple locations around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Still my favorite place for Mexican in NE Ohio. The salsa rocks.  Try the Burrito Mojato it's  my go-to menu item."}
{"text":"Was in from out of town visiting family. Went on a friday night on a recommendation from my uncle. Excellent experience. We were seated right away, and drinks came quick. Margaritas reasonably priced and tasted great! Food portions large (needed doggie bags), servers were very attentive and the food itself was great! Would definitely return when back in town!"}
{"text":"I as always (for the 24+ years I have been coming here) can say the meal was excellent! I have had a few over the years had some less then perfect meals but we all have bad days occasionally. This food has spice and FLAVOR! I am not combining the two words, to much spice/heat is a waste of the meal; you taste nothing. You get just enough to wake up your taste buds and make the flavors come alive! My favorite? The ceviche! It's always slightly different by awesome!"}
{"text":"I have grown to love Mexican food over the years. What sticks out to me about this place was the subtle acidity in everything ordered. I love sour/vinegar/citrus flavors! So that is what makes this place stand out to me. Also I was able to chow down on their pleasant patio on a breezy but balmy summer day.  Parking was easy too, especially in the off food rush  hours that we went. I will be back to try margaritas soon, fingers crossed. If you find your self here, do yourself a favor and order the crab appetizer!!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas and I loved my food! Ordered the tacos americanos, my guilty pleasure, and the goat cheese guacamole. Everyone here was having a great time."}
{"text":"Severely underwhelmed by this place.  Sorry to be a hater, but the chips were slightly stale, the enchilada sauce was super salty, and the shredded chicken was very dry and bland.  The refried beans tasted sour for some reason.  Service was good, but all-in-all, there are better places for Mexican food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Nice selection, beans are not fried in lard.  There is a nice patio when the weather is good.  Margaritas are excellent."}
{"text":"Luchita's Restaurant, located off the square in Hudson, is a Tex-Mex style Mexican restaurant. If I had to leave a one-word review, it would be 'meh'. The food is good, not great. The service is pleasant, but exceedingly average. The margaritas taste like mix, like you'd expect to see at some nondescript Mexican place. I had the Baja Carnitas and they were good but a little dry. The tortillas served alongside were given to me as an afterthought. I was expecting and upscale or innovated twist on the traditional Mexican fare served every, and that's not what I got. And I was hoping the bar would feature tequilas and make those step to the front in the margaritas; or even better, have a tequila menu or different tequila drinks. None of that. So if you're in the area and have a craving for Mexican, stop by. If you are looking to get blown away by a fresh and innovative way to prepare the same old ingredients, then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"A really enjoyable Mexican restaurant experience! The food and drinks were wonderful and so was the service."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Food was fresh and served in a very timely manner. Couldn't ask for more from an apple empanada!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, a familiar haunt that never disappoints! The staff is great and hilarious, and the drinks are on point. If you are looking for a great time, sit at the bar and make friends with your neighbor, you will have a blast. The bartender gives me life, so funny and charming. The food is also always great, I recommend the Burro de Tabasco, one of the best I've had. I would recommend Luchitas to anyone I know"}
{"text":"Hands Down my favorite Mexican food in town!
All the hip New Mexican places that have opened over the years while good in there own unique ways have nothing in this great cleveland Mexican food landmark.
Been coming here for over 25 years and still love it as much now as back then.

For starters! The queso fundido is amazing, with such a delicious blend of cheese and chorizo. 
The complimentary chips and salsa say it all! Large chunks of onion and cilantro accent this fresh tomato based salsa. The guacamole stands out as some of the best around. Never had a batch that wasn't  perfect.
 Chip get refilled frequently so be careful not to overdue it. You can fill up fast.

The 3 burrito combo is a fantastic deal , whether you get chicken or beef you cannot go wrong.

We just Love everything. Try the specials they change all the time but always worth a try. Even their little salad had a unique delicious taste. 
The staff is warm and welcoming! 
I truly hope they are around for years to come!"}
{"text":"My 15 yr old daughter and 5 of her friends wanted a special evening last night. They made 6:30pm reservations the day before. They arrived 10 minutes early and were told they didn't have a table for them..... so they sat them (15 YEAR OLDS!!) at the bar!!  They all sat in a row and couldn't talk. They asked again for a regular table and were never given one. They were treated poorly and had terrible service. One of the girls received the wrong order and was given major attitude from the server when she spoke up. They were given their meals at the bar with no silverware and had to wait 10 minutes for silverware.  Just awful. We will never be back.  Shameful way to treat customers regardless of the age."}
{"text":"Really nice. Traveling across the country to Seattle. Delicious ground beef enchiladas with red salsa! Also, full points on the margaritas. 

After the warm meal, now I'm back in the car. I tell my boyfriend I'm writing a review on yelp, and he asks: \"how many stars are you giving it?\"

\"5\"

\"Good.\""}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food, not to mention the margs are delish! You can get a pitcher for $15, it will give you about 6 cups full of drinks, pretty good size for two people. We also stuffed our face with the complimentary chips and salsa-so good! It's making my mouth water just thinking about them. I had the chimichanga and asked for cheese sauce on the side, my oh my! My taste buds were in taste bud heaven that's for sure, I finished the whole plate and even contemplated licking it clean."}
{"text":"We have been to Luchitas twice this month. They have a skinny margarita that is amazing. The waitresses are friendly and generous with the chips & salsa. The food was so delicious and I didn't leave feeling stuffed which often happens with Mexican food. There have been several owners so if you haven't been recently I highly recommend."}
{"text":"On the west side, this is one of the best spots to get great Mexican food.  The decor is nice, the service is friendly, but the food-very good.  To me the food here sets itself apart from other Mexican places because it tastes homemade.

Excellent Margaritas by the pitcher!  Expect a wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"Looking for a perfect Mexican restaurant? Found one! For starters, we like to eat late on the weekends. 10:30 PM, is our start time for dinner. Luchita's stays open until midnight.
The Hostess greeted us and was very friendly, as she seated us in a back corner.
I ordered the Cheese Enchiladas. Portions are very liberal.
The dinner comes with rice and vegetarian beans. The meal was so appealing. It also came out within 7 minutes.The flavoring was just right. The Waitress was so friendly and helpful.
The atmosphere was great. Even though the bar crowd was very alive, the wall between the bar and the dining area was great for acoustics. We could talk without having to raise our voices. In the summer months, they also have a perfect patio outside.College kids and 20-30 something's love to regroup here. But Hudson neighbors also abound. The meal for  2 was 26.00.
There is something for everyone on the menu And the menu has a glossary of terms,
How refreshing!
Here is the icing on the cake, as we were leaving, the Owner came out to thank us for coming in. I loved the care, the food and service here! This is a perfect Mexican restaurant. It has everything you could ask for in a Mexican Restaurant.
P.S. the Salsa is great and has a punch to it!"}

{"text":"Was really disappointed. Queso Fundido was a giant mound of melted cheese with very little chorizo sprinkled in. The corn tortillas it was served with tasted old and stale and almost crumbled apart in my hands. The enchilada w/ their \"special mole\" was flavorless. There was no spice to it, nothing Mexican tasting about it. A very sad mole. The Mexican rice tasted like the plastic container it must have been sitting in for a while. 

And I agree with Jason, it is a dump. This doesn't even qualify as a dive. For the most part, I like dive joints. Nothing makes sense inside this location and it just feels like an awkward, uncomfortable environment. 

Will stick with the Parma location, where their food actually tastes like Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our goto Mexican restaurant in the Hudson/twinsburg/Macedonia area.  Management is friendly and food is great.  I have had several seafood platters that were excellent.   Their margaritas are also excellent.   You will find a wait on weekend nights but you can walk around downtown Hudson until you receive a text that your table is ready.  Atmosphere is nice,  with dim lighting and a beautiful bar in the middle of the area."}

This week visit they tried to sit us in the dining room were 60% of the tables were full of dirty dishes and the waiters were hanging out on there phones and eating food while chatting with bartender and a friend we decided not to eat that night
Tables should be cleared immediately 
Cleaning should be done every night all the time"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this restaurant and it turned out to be an utter disappointment. The food was ok but the service was very disappointing. The employees did not respect us and when we got the bill, the tip was already included which made us very annoyed and uncomfortable. Then, when getting the bill, two of our checks were messed up and they did not give us back the correct amount in return. So rude and so disappointing."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place today. SO good. I'm here now and trying everything on the menu- seems like it anyway. This place rocks. I would drive for hours for the queso fundido. I'm now obsessed. You have to try it."}
{"text":"I must say I used to live in this area for 20 years and very much regret not eating here . I had a Chicken Burrito and a chicken Enchilada excellent flavor and quantity. Nice clean decor and very simple restaurant! The Margaritas finally someone pours a nice amount of liqueur in their Margaritas. Very nice impression for my first time eating here."}
{"text":"I was tired today from working too much, was off today and wanted to stop and take lunch home.  This was my 1st visit.  I ordered the vegetarian tostadas, plus 2 bean enchiladas on the side.  With the chips and salsa they give you, I had lunch AND dinner.  I sat at the bar and waited for my order.  This is an older place, and has a dive-y feel, but in a good way.  I noticed that in spite of the age, the place was spotlessly clean; in fact, I detected a hint of floor cleaner scent.  This doesn't bother me--better than the place being dirty!  The bartender was very nice.

I got home, and tasted the salsa--delish!!  Yum!!  The tostadas were tasty, but I especially liked the bean enchiladas with red sauce.  Very tasty--my favorite thing.  I'm giving only 4 stars because the chips were a little stale--leftovers from yesterday, maybe?  I crisped them up in the oven.  All in all, I will return.  Yummy food!"}

a lot of changes but the food has always remained consistent and very good.
The best Mexican you'll get in the area. 
Azteca (house soup) is wonderful. Good chicken flavor topped with avocado. Sometimes a little bit too salty.
Very good salsa and chips.  Burritos, enchaladas, tacos all good. 
Service has always been good.  It can get expensive drinking here, especially
if you like margaritas.  (But it is not a drinkers bar.)
Atmosphere is comfortable and clean.
Good food and beers on tap."}

{"text":"Very disappointing. Even more disappointing if you're familiar with the quality of other Luchita's locations.

I could always count on excellent taste and service at the Luchita's on W. 117th in Cleveland (and a now-closed operation in Mentor). The menu went past the usual AmeriMex to include more authentic choices.

Went to the Hudson Luchita's on a Thursday evening. With the restaurant half-full, I was led past many empty tables to a spot right next to the (cold-leaking) window. Service was brusque. Menu was more limited than the others, which wasn't promising.

The cheese-and-poblano tamales were odd. Two tamales, one covered with red sauce and one with green, but slopped together so the sauces mostly blended. The red-sauced tamale had a very thin vein of filling, perhaps shoelace-sized, with a few shreds of poblano and threads of cheese. I had to go through 80% of the length of the other one before I finally found two shreds of pepper and a small glob of cheese; most of it was just cornmeal all the way through. Dry cornmeal.

My main course was the tinga de pollo, which was one of my faves from Mentor. But when I lifted a forkful of this tinga, I revealed a deep pool of watery liquid. The chicken itself was extremely salty, masking other flavors.

A minor point, but the waitress did that annoying thing where, when you agree to a water refill, she whisks away your half-full glass and you have to wait for her to putter around the other tables before you finally get it back. And then she stuck it at the far end of the table from me -- literally up to the edge."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Luchita,
As a regular contributor to Yelp, I usually like to give an establishment a couple of tries before I post my critique.  My first experience at Luchita's was 6 years ago, and because it was not quite stellar, we thought we'd give you some time to get it right. Time's up!   

I am a corporate trainer who  works with caregivers to improve their skills in providing patients with a positive experience.  I suggest your employees could use some training in dealing with the public!

First, upon entering, we were looked at as though we were intruders. \"Oh God, we've got customers.\"  Come on, this is Hudson!  You can do better than that!

Second, I wouldn't exactly call your employee D******** a \"Server\" as service is not what she gave us!  With only 3 tables occupied at 5 pm on a Friday night with a handful of servers on staff, she seemed more interested in hiding in the back room than she did doing her job.  The lack of attention is a clear indication of management in absentia!

We had to seek service from a couple other employees to get one water refill for my husband ... and the bill. Another server filled my husband's glass. Eventually D***** delivered the check, pitching it onto the table from a distance of 4 feet..with her back turned, muttering something under her breath like, \"There you go.\"   She should try for the Minor Leagues, for a server she is not!  

At least she warned us about the dangerously hot dish delivered within 3 minutes of our order, meaning one thing--- microwaved food!  The order was accurate, the food, and particularly the sauce, was lackluster with a finish of industrial, the music was New Age!  Come on...how about some Mariachi with our prepackaged entrees?

Needless to say, what a disappointment--Especially considering your location!  Guess that's why I don't know anyone who has darkened your door since we visited the last time.  

PS. The Sangria was tasty!"}
{"text":"Twice refused to take my groupon for unprinted 'rules'. Forgot to bring an entree and everyone done before I could catch someone's attention to ask. Not my fave Mexican anymore. And the bus boy was wiping tables with a rag that hit the floor. Classy all around."}
{"text":"Service is pretty awesome as well as food . I was surprised it only had 3.5 stars. Wednesday's special is $2 enchiladas & they are sooooo good."}
{"text":"The chimichangas were alright, not bad. Guacamole was pretty fake-tasting and bland, salsa was disappointing as well. Chips were unenjoyable. The rice looks like bad fried rice from a Chinese food court and tastes not quite as good."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind. Food is amazing. This week's special is great. Tostadas con poll en chorizo. (Chicken and chrizo on a crispy tortilla with pickled red onions lettuce and tomato.) Worth a try.  The margaritas are the best in town. If you haven't been here before or in a while, give it a try."}
{"text":"For a low key, hole in the wall little bar/restaurant, the tacos here were amazing. It's all I've had on the menu, but it's a cool little spot regardless. Dark set ambiance. Definitely authentic cuisine. It's in a remote location off of 117th and you would probably never think of stopping in there, if you even noticed it, but it's definitely worth it. 

I have not been back since the first time, I was 21 I believe, wow time flies, I'm an old man now. Hahaha. I have it bookmarked and will attend sometime in the near future. Stay tuned for an update, a lot can happen in 63 years."}
{"text":"For the price and location you are not going to find a better Mexican restaurant. I went here for years however I've since moved away but went her the other week and am happy to report that it's just as good as always."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I just moved here from Cincinnati for his job, and we tried Luchita's last night. It was a totally random pick because we had driven into Hudson for dinner and it was one of 2 restaurants open at First and Main (Memorial Day). 
I didn't drink, although a margarita sounded great (will have to indulge next time), but we got some queso to start. Totally not the Mexican queso I am use to, but I thought it was awesome. It had huge chunks of veggies in it (made me feel less guilty....my weight watchers plan is not going so well). For dinner I had a combo - the veggie enchilada (spinach/cheese/potato) with red sauce, and a beef taco. Both were awesome, and not to greasy. 
The only \"bad\" thing I can say is that it took at least 30 minutes to get our food. There was a huge party in front of us whose order must have gone in first. But it was worth it and they were very friendly. We will def go back!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican restaurant in the area!  I've eaten at many Mexican restaurants all over the country and this restaurant is very poor. The service was great. Stop there. The menu is limited. The flan is the worst I've ever had!  It was full of holes. Not creamy like a good flan should I be. I brought half home and have decided to throw it away. It's not worth the calories. I've never written such a bad review before and hope I never do again."}
{"text":"Wow, this place used to be so much better.  Went last night and the food and service was crap.  They messed up the orders and I was the last person at a table of 7 to get my food.  The shredded chicken was dry and overly smothered with mole sauce.  My friend's tamales looked awful.  My mom asked for sauce on the side, which they ignored.  Waited forever to get our drinks. Then they messed up the bills.  Can you say disaster? Never going back."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to Luchita's - well, I guess I live close to A luchita's but not this one. The hudson location is much better than the cleveland one. And, it's probably a good thing I don't live closer, or I'd be about 50 lbs heavier!! I've been to this location multiple times in the past few months and I have to say, it's one of my favorite mex restaurants in NEO. Love their chips and salsa. Their queso is wonderful too!! 

If you're in the mood for margs, I'd definitely recommend getting the margarita flight. You get a sampler of three margaritas of the bartender's choice - and by sampler I mean a glass of each. Get a few amongst your friends and t's a great way to try margs and an even greater way to get tipsy fast.

I love sitting out on the patio in the summer, but inside is just as good in the winter. The waiters/waitresses are all super friendly and on slow days when they have time, fun to talk to. I've never had a trip there with poor service and like I said, I've been about 6 times between July and last week. 

I fell in love with their cheese and potato enchiladas, so basically never steer away from it when I go. It's so different from other mexican restaurants and I was a bit hesitant to try it the first time around, but the waitress highly recommended it and I haven't looked back since! It's basically a pureed blend of potato, spinach, etc (the two things I can actually see) which is mixed with cheese. I got the mole sauce once but didn't like the sweet flavor so have gotten the enchiladas with the red sauce ever since.... LOVE....

I also love the area that Luchita's is in. SUPER cute - First and Main. Parking can suck if it's a weekend or weeknight, but you'll eventually find a spot- Just keep swimming... food is worth it :)"}
{"text":"Awful! The floors were dirty as if they were brushing food off the tables and just leaving it there all day. The seats in our booth were torn. My margarita was served in a solo cup and it tasted like margarita mix and our Burrito was bland. Other than the excellent location, I really can't think of a positive."}
{"text":"I have a hard time understanding why people like this place?? The only Mexican I had worse than Luchita's is Zocalo on E. 4th downtown.  Bleech.  Stay away from both places!!"}
