{"text":"Quality food (especially breakfast) served promptly.  I get the feeling some of these negative reviews might be from a disgruntled ex employee.  I've never had anything but good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our two visits this month to Lou's Tivoli Gardens in Surprise, after we had just discovered it on Bell Rd just west of El Mirage Road.  We also used to go to the location in Sun City a few years ago.

We went once for breakfast and once for an early lunch.  They do have several breakfast specials for $5.50 that are fine.  Not fantastic, but just fine.  Yes, it is a senior crowd, and that is actually kind of nice, with a quiet atmosphere where you can actually hear each other speak.

The food is good and the prices are reasonable.  I look forward to going again and having lunch or an early dinner next time.  The do not have wifi there and actually most of their diners do not have their face locked into the face of an electronic device like a cell phone or tablet.  They are actually talking to each other.

Our service was good and the prices are reasonable.  Seems to be a good value.  We are glad they are there.  It is a nice choice to include in our list of favorites.

Had a small chef salad.  It was a little too small.  Next time I will have the full sized one, would have been worth the extra $2.  They also serve a fresh and hot small loaf of bread with the meals (don't think for breakfast, though) 

If you don't mind that it is mostly their long-time loyal senior customers there, you will enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"The setting is that of an old diner, which isn't that bad. The place seemed to cater to older folks and given the location, that is to be expected. 

The prices are decent and the portions are huge. I had the Gorgonzola spinich dish and it left a little to be desired. My wife had the chicken Parmesan and she enjoyed that. The meal comes with garlice bread, which is excellent, a salad and the beverage. A good place if on a budget. Our waiter was terrible. I repeat terrible! At one point he brought the food to the people next to us and simply dropped out tea pitcher at our table. This stayed there for the deration of our meal. When he brought desert he did not bring a spoon. So rather than go to the station to get a spoon the kid took a spoon off of someone else's table as that person was eating and gave it to us. He did this right in front of us!

We got our bill and I tipped him just shy of 10%, which is fair considering the circumstances. Upon leaving the restaurant my wife had to use the restroom. This waiter took it upon himself to wait outside the restroom and confront my pregnant wife about our tip. He said to her sarcastically, \"I'm sorry if my service wasn't good enough.\" and walked away. Up until now I was willing to give this place a second chance, but not anymore. I would stay away from this place in favor of a more reasonable establishment."}
{"text":"The wife and I used to come here on a regular basis for the past 2 years and really liked it. So much in fact that we brought others with us. In that time there was once that we sent our food back because it was so overcooked the egg was hard as a rock. When Lou came over he could have cared less. So we just let it go and figured he was having a bad day. Skip to about 2 months ago...we were at breakfast again and ordered our usual eggs Benedict. The waitress was Priscilla.  She was quite pleasant but little did we know.
And we ordered as we always did...very softly poached eggs. We'll the eggs came again hard as a rock.  We told her and she said she'd get the owner.  Out come Lou and he proceeds to tell us \"we'll that's the way you ordered them\". He was such an angry SOB and took no responsibility for anything.  Priscilla comes back and proceeds to say to me,\"do you need anything pops\". I looked at my wife and we were so shocked to hear someone speak to me that way. What a smartass she was. We vowed then we would never go back. As we were leaving, I voiced my opinion to the gal at the front door.  And what do you think she told me....Priscilla was Lou's sons girlfriend. Now it all makes sense. Lou takes absolutely no responsibility for any wrongdoing in his restaurant. There is no way in hell he would comp a meal let alone apologize for the mistake. He is an ornery old man who needs to retire....he is not a people person and is a horrific example of an owner."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone to Lou's now for several years and still can't get over what a great value it is! Most meals include desert and beverage for a modest price. The best little secret in town is the Thursday night happy hour with half price drinks and appetizers. We also were impressed by the Thursday night entertainment. His sign said Eddy J and wow can he sing. We stayed and danced until closing. Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Rude management. If you register a complaint with Lou he will tell you not to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast with a home cooked feel and fast friendly service at a great price."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, it was very good, not exceptional. But, I will never be back, because of the extremely rude attitude. Our family went there, following my mother's funeral, and after we spent $400 in food, several of us went to the bar and spent another couple hundred, but at the 9pm closing time, instead of cleaning up around us, as we finished our drinks, these gorillas literally pulled our tables and chairs out from under us to rearrange them. I've never seen that happen, and probably  never will, because I'll never set foot in its dump again."}
{"text":"I don't like to trash restaurants either but 2 times here was two times too many.  Dinner was forgettable at best (a plastic container with canned fruit cocktail?really?).  Breakfast was ever worse! Have they heard of HOT coffee? How many times do you have to ask for cream? When you order a bacon & cheese omelet, who the heck just lays 2 pieces of whole bacon in the omelet & just folds it over AND then doesn't bother to finish cooking the omelet?  Greasy overcooked hashbrowns, toast drowning in butter & that godawful fruit cocktail again. This place is a heartattack on a plate.  Service is HORRID! The over 75 crowd that frequents this place has obviously decided they don't deserve good, fresh & tasty food and has just given in to CHEAP.  How does a place like this stay in business?"}
{"text":"Not thrilled and not going back.  Met a fellow church member there to discuss an upcoming event and decided we'd meet over breakfast.

Waitress came by for drink orders.  I ordered iced tea and water, my friend ordered coffee and water.  Drinks came quick but no ice in the water.  They provided a full carafe for my friend though.

Now, for the food.  The toast was good.  But that's it.  The two strips of bacon were cheap.  Bottom of the barrel type bacon.  Not the good, thick cut bacon.  The hashbrowns were off as well.  Too much butter or oil made them soggy.  But the worst part was the scrambled eggs.  They are obviously not made to order.  This tells me they make them up dozens at a time and let them sit.  The coloring was horrible and the eggs were filled with very hard chunks of \"egg\".  Couldn't even eat them."}
{"text":"We visited tonight for the first time. The lot is always packed so our interest was piqued. 
My husband ordered a pasta dish and I craved the sausage and sauerkraut dinner. While our orders were being prepared, we took in the surroundings. Having been slightly familiar with the German restaurant that had been there previously, we expected upgrades considering the success of Tivoli Gardens. Instead, the decor is tired - nay, beat.  Tape held together the upholstery of the booth behind me. 

There was live entertainment during dinner. Sometimes the performer sang live - reminiscent of Al Alberts. Sometimes he sang along with karaoke. Sometimes with a full track, occasionally offering a short phrase during the chorus and letting the actual singer do the rest. It was interesting.

Our food arrived and we found that we were quite hungry. My husband's meal wasn't quite the Italian dish he was expecting. Too much \"dry\" pasta, not enough meat and veggies. It was accompanied by doughy garlic bread. My sausage was sufficient, but the vegetables had been BOILED and could be mushed with a fork. The sauerkraut was sparse and appeared to be singed. 

I suspect that even though this location is on Bell Road in Surprise, that the fans of this restaurant reside in Sun City. The food quality was less diner, and more hospital fare. Not to offend anyone in Sun City. I'll be there someday, God willing. 

The server was friendly and attentive. I cannot see us returning. The quality of the food simply isn't good enough for us to squander a date night on."}
{"text":"Something non chain on the land of the walking dead. Average. Blue hairs like the one price for everything deal, requires less thinking on their part. Instead of a coat check room they have a walker check. Live music on some nights"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! The food her is normal. I think the majority of the veggies come from a can; but where else can you feed a party of 7 for $100? You get soup or salad, your meal and ice cream for about $10. There was live music, which was enjoyed by some and hated by the rest. It was too loud for the majority of the clientele which seem to be over 60. Several of the orders came out incorrectly and we had to wait a bit for refills or drinks in general. It's all understandable when you realize how busy this place was for a Monday night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place for the \"Senior\" crowd.  The clientele are welcomed and treated with a smile by all staff. I understand if the \"younger\" crowd does not enjoy this restaurant, but they can go somewhere else
where they feel more comfortable.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are very affordable and very appreciated by seniors. This has become a fun meeting place for many church groups, car groups and overall fun place for friends to meet and know they are welcomed and enjoy good meals together.
Definitely a big thank you to the owner and staff for offering a wonderful environment."}
{"text":"Considered a senior citizen hang out with the decent senior discount. The prices are moderate without the discount though. The salads are very large and pretty fresh. The pizzas were thin crust & tasty. The food was a positive for us. We were told it depends on what your order, at times the food can be bland. As for the service, they were friendly and accommodating. They sometimes talk to their patrons like they are children instead of seniors, but perhaps that's their attempts at talking clear and slow for the hearing impaired. Our plates were dirty and had to be replaced. When we were getting our leftovers to go, the food was not packaged for us; instead we were given the containers. For a senior hang out, one would think they would offer to do it. That's all the feedback I have. Hopefully next time will be a better experience altogether."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving at my Mothers request.... read the reviews on Yelp said ...  cant be that bad..............WRONG  Thanksgiving and all Holidays should be your Super Bowl... Best service best food............This place had the worst service I EVER HAD EVER..... The food was mediocre at best... i guess thinking we were with some seniors we would not notice....Wrong..... I cant give this no stars but would..... Stay away... FYI I hate bashing a place I waas in this business for years but...... Time for a reboot"}
{"text":"I always come here for the breakfast.The breakfast here is delicious.I recommend getting the Country Fried Steak with Eggs and Hash Brown.Although the service is a little slow,it is a great place for dinner and especially the breakfast."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my \"go to\" restaurants in Surprise, but it isn't as good as it used to be. It has typical family restaurant fare. The fries are crispy and delicious, but my reuben did not have much corned beef and they forgot the sauerkraut.  They definitely cater to the senior crowd. Prices have gone up but food quality is still average."}
{"text":"We are snowbirds since January 2016 at Sun City Festival.  Have passed by this restaurant many times and just made a (bad) assumption that this was just an old restaurant that seniors went to.  Last week our neighbors across the street who have been here for over 3 years said they tried it and were quite impressed.  So instead of going to IHOP for breakfast after church on Sunday, we elected to go to Tivoli Gardens.  WOW.  What a lovely surprise.  The omelette we shared along with a nice crisp waffle was outstanding, light, tasty and had lots of veggies in it which is what we wanted.  Quick service...the fastest we think we've ever had.  Nice interior, comfortable, warm, happy and friendly employees, quiet, extensive menu, nice lounge area with place for music entertainers to play.  Sorry we underestimated this wonderful place.  It is now one our \"go to\" list for breakfast and now lunch and dinner, too.  Right by the nice lakes with fountains in them.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast as always. So glad I was able to bring my visiting grandson. He is showing me how to use Yelp."}
{"text":"We (4 people) were greeted by friendly staff and quickly seated on Sunday morning for breakfast. The server was cleaver in coordinating and combining breakfast plates to suit our requests. Everything was properly prepared (eggs fully cooked, warm toast) and tasty. Service was good and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Well, we came back after two years.( See my review of 5/26/13 ) Don't really know why it took so long to return.
There were four of us. Very warm, and friendly greeting by two gentlemen when we entered.  Our server Martha, was pleasant, gracious, and attentive, always with a smile on her face. Very proactive in making sure that drinks were filled, and any other needs were taken care of.  Four different entrees were ordered. Top Sirloin Steak, Chicken Parmigiana, BBQ Chicken Breast, and Chicken Stir Fry. All arrived as ordered, including special requests for deletions. Food was excellent. As usual, you get a choice of soup, salad, or coleslaw, in addition to a potato and vegetable with each meal. Beverages are $1.00. Dessert ( ice cream or pudding ) is also included.They don't try to rip you off here. Reasonable prices are one thing, but when you combine that with exemplary service, excellent food, and very good portions...........what is there not to like?"}
{"text":"Food was good, prepared properly, and the addition of extra garlic was on point. Venue is roomy. Good spot."}
{"text":"If you think lots of food is good food you will love this place.  Friendly staff, good service but coleslaw looked old, I ordered Manicotti which was dried out with very little cheese filling, red sauce was passable.  Special was filet dinner for $29.00 from salad to dessert which we thought was pricey and didnt order when compared to a great steak house like Longhorn which never disappoints.  I understand they have music later in the evening which probably pleases the majority senior crowd.  Neither I nor my husband will not go again, two stars are for the friendly, prompt service its not their fault the food is below standard."}
{"text":"I come year once a year when I visit my Aunt.  Food isn't amazing, but they have low prices (even lower if you get there before 6pm).  Live music on Monday nights, and it's always fun to watch the Sun City locals dancing!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. It just serves its niche clientele. if you are older and are accustomed to that style of food and service go and enjoy. Do not expect too much"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, probably won't be a third time.  Both times, the wait times here were really bad and the service is lackluster.  My entree really sucked the 2nd time I went, too."}
{"text":"The food here is just bad.  I have eaten here 3 times too many.  The gravy is so salty, I had to send my food back because I couldn't eat it and it wasn't homemade.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place is just awful watered down spinach and artichoke dip barley warm meatballs. It took them 30 minutes just to get a beer don't even bother with this place."}
{"text":"Whilst staying at the Windmill Suites hotel across the street, I strolled over to watch the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl.  It was Sunday, February 7th 2016, at 7:15pm.  Their posted operating hours say they're open until 8:00pm on Sundays.  I was properly attired in Arizona casual--nice new shorts and golf shirt, canvas loafers and socks, and a Seattle Seahawks ball cap.  There were a half-dozen occupied tables in the dining room and nobody in the bar.  The televisions around the dining room were tuned to the game.  I wanted to watch the rest of the game and have a drink, maybe two if there was time, and see what they served for dessert.  I walked in the front door, waited by the hostess stand to be seated, and was told by an employee, possibly the manager, in a loud voice from across the room that they were closed.  I didn't make a scene.  I turned on my heel and left, knowing that I would describe this experience for potential future patrons who understand the concept of karma.  Although I'll be staying across the street all week, the weather is spectacular, and Tivoli Gardens is the only non-fast-food restaurant I can walk to in less than 20 minutes, I won't return.  And I think you know what I think you should do if you're considering giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Be prepared for slow service and prices that are too high for this Denny's type restaurant. The only plus is that the food is very good, so if you have time to kill and money to waste, I would recommend Tivoli Gardens."}
{"text":"I had the lunch pot roast sandwich special which was served on white bread with one scoop of your Choice of one side which were mashed potatoes coleslaw French fries etc I chose The mashed potatoes which was one small scoop covered with Brown gravy The waitress did not give us a choice of bread portion was small we left feeling hungry and I seriously thought that the price was high for The amount of food we got The waitress Martha when we mentioned that we were not happy  she just grab the plates off the table and seemed very disinterested in our comments I have eaten here in the past but this time the food  portions have gotten smaller and the prices have increased all that was on the plate was one slice of bread with just enough  roast beef on it to cover it that surprisingly was tender two other pieces of stale bread Heavily buttered The scoop of mashed potatoes with gravy and a small wedge of seedless   Watermelon all this bountiful feast for the price of $7.99   I will not be returning to this establishment I hope this review is helpful"}
{"text":"The food here is just bad. also, my son and I went to wash our hands and the men's just smelled gross. my wife said the lady's was fine so maybe we just had bad timing. the food had two flavors, salt and nothing. we got the spinach artichoke dip as an app. it came with stale bread that looked to make an honest attempt at being garlic toast but really just tasted like a baguette soaked in brine before it was dehydrated. we asked for some plain bread but by the time it came the dip was cold and tasted like wet paper. my daughter got broccoli soup that also tasted like a salt lick and by some miracle of science seemed to be composed completely out of the skin that forms on top. son got the kids corn dog that was uncooked at the center. wait staff was nice and attentive and the live music was a nice touch but none of it was enough to cover for the salty slugs that we paid and tipped foR."}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Tivoli Gardens. On Monday night there is Karaoke. I went with some friends and we all enjoyed ourselves. The food was good.  I
had a roast beef sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles.  There is much more for dinner but I never can finish a big meal.  There are specials that come with dessert.  I tried Karaoke for the first time and was really scared cause I am tone deaf.  It was fun!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've lived in the area for more than 11 years, driven passed 100's of times, and never stopped in for a meal!  Our mistake!!!  Our AC went out, placing us in the hotel across the street...we walked across the street to the most pleasent, relaxing, comfortable, restaurant....Lou's Tivoli Gardens.  What an amazing surprise, in Surprise!  Wonderful, quick service, relaxing dining, considerate service, live music, romantic dancing, amazing choice of delicitable meals, all at reasonable prices.   Thank you for a lovely evening during a terrible time."}
{"text":"We where staying  across  the street at the Windmill and I said to my wife let's try this place and it was a 10 
From the food to the service  
(Angelica ) we both would come back and give it a 10 plus"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner!  The spinach dip appetizer was a nice start.  Grilled shrimp dinner was delicious as was the cod dinner special.  All entrees served with a nice salad and dessert (loved the spumoni!), plus 2 small loves of homemade bread.  Our server, Joe, was fun, knew the menu and was attentive, but not overbearing.  Live music in the lounge section added nice background music and there is plenty of room to dance! We will be back next time we visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We took our pre-teen granddaughters here before the Pageant. Food was good and generous. Service was attentive. Nice music combo in the background. Have to say, the place doesn't wow me. However, for this kind of venue they do a nice job and is worth it for a convenient before the Pageant thing."}
{"text":"Tivoli Gardens is a favorite restaurant for the Sun City crowd and the menu reflects that with items and tastes for the more 'mature' palate.  It fills up at dinnertime and it seems like a lot of the folks know each other. 
 
I had the Thursday special; Corned Beef & Cabbage. It was very good and a good large portions for $9.99.  It came with carrots, potatoes, rye bread, cole slaw and dessert.

Service is adequate. Prices are decent.  Not my favorite kind of place, but it's not a bad place at all."}
{"text":"Gary M.

Went there last night and it was as great as always.  My wife and I both had Italian dishes and they were wonderful!  You can buy a bottle of wine for $12.95 and it is pretty good.  What you don't drink you can cork and take home.  Very friendly table servers, some dance a little to music as they serve customers and the vibe is warm and upbeat.  We are older folks and love the entertainment which is a one person band who caters to senior citizens and sings songs almost exclusively from the fifties, sixties and seventies.  The guy is really, really good and there is a small dance floor where you can dance to both the slow oldies but goodies or quicker beats.  THIS IS A FUN place to enjoy an evening but it might not appeal as much to younger people.  The food portions are large and we always take home some for the next day.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"\"Tivoli Gardens\"-- how the heck did they come up with that name?  The only Italian food in the vicinity might be a traumatized meatball hiding underneath a booth.  And don't be looking for any gardens-- anything that might be growing outside in the scorching heat would only be there thanks to water stolen from another state.  

Anyway, the food was barely mediocre, but service was terrible.  The waitress' limited attention span seemed mainly diverted to the needs of the herd of elderly gentlemen who had commandeered the \"special functions room\".  The kitchen staff also seemed incapable of coping with the onslaught of senior citizens, which one could probably have anticipated, given the locale."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing Italian about it (odd name choice). Think more diner from 30+ yrs ago. The place itself is dirty. I was near the station they keep the clean silverware and extra small plates, ABOVE that is where they had the dirty rags they wiped down the tables. Although it was cheap and close to the office I will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst place ever. 

The OWNER has a disgusting mouth to his customers. Told me to \"lick the sweat off his balls\" in front of my 80 year old mother!! Way to go \"Lou\"....

The man needs to get a grip. Can't treat people like that. 

PLEASE DONT PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS !!!

He actually wanted to fight me cause I told him he was being rude to my mother and should apologize. Fight me? He tried desperately to goad me into throwing a punch so he could POUNCE!! Vicious man. Crazy??
The man is a joke to the Surprise business community.

Please don't patronize this jerk!!!!

Please!!"}
{"text":"Very good fish fry. Our waiter was excellent! Nice place with inexpensive food but tasty."}
{"text":"Very good American food with nice variety on the menu.

Popular ... we had a short 5 min wait.

good décor friendly wait staff"}
{"text":"I support this local establishment, I'm just tired of all the franchise restaurants all over the place there's nothing more better than mom & pops establishment that make their food from scratch. It's the good food & spirits that keeps me & my family coming back to this establishment. Senior crowd yes but there such wonderful caring people who lived their lives & its excellent crowd. In the evening they have good music all around to see old folks dancing one day I wanna reach that level & enjoy myself like that. I highly recommend this local establishment to anyone the food has soul there's nothing better to enjoy."}
{"text":"What has happened at Tivoli Gardens?  There is a new menu, and so many of the items that brought us in are no longer available.  What happened?  We have been regular \"snowbird\" guests for several years but now there seems no reason to bother going back.  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"This is a place where mostly seniors go and the wait staff is as senior as the clientele. The waitress was excellent and very nice however, she couldn't hear us when ordering. There were no menus for the kids (they ran out) but the waitress verbally gave us the kids menu. Everyone got what they ordered except for one person. When the wrong food was brought out and we questioned it the waitress insisted we ordered the country steak not the chicken fried steak. We didn't press the issue. The rest of the meal was perfect. They give you a good amt of food for the price and drinks are cheap. Overall I would probably go elsewhere for dinner with 3 kids."}
{"text":"Over the last couple of years I've eaten here several times - breakfast, lunch and dinner. Out of the ten times I've eaten there, the service has been friendly and quick all but one or two times. (The service in the room for groups can be great . . . or virtually nonexistent.)

My most recent meal there was ribs - $15 plus tax and tip. The dinner included vegetable (green beans), small loaf of dark brown bread, baked potato, dessert (small cup of ice cream) and beverage. So the price covers a lot.

The meat on the ribs was great - extremely tender (fall off the bone), the sauce was okay - a bit too sweet for me. The size of the ribs is not big, but for the price it is a good value. The green beans were not cooked quite enough and had no seasoning at all - none whatsoever on them, not even salt. The bread was great. The baked potato and iced tea were okay. The ice cream dessert were fine.

Service was fine, smooth, unremarkable - in a good way. I am tempted to add another star to my rating, but, to be honest, I'm not that much of a fan.

During high season, expect to wait for a table in the evening. During the summer, seating seems to be pretty easy."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really nice atmosphere and has entertainment and dancing and that is all very nice.  There was a good crowd of customers there, mostly retired folks, but Alas !  The food was very mediocre.  I really didn't know that it was possible to serve bad spaghetti .. but mine was lousy.   The garlic bread was saturated with a very  bland tasting oil .. it was awful!!    Wife's  baked cod wasn't tasty at all, and her baked potato had sour cream on that didn't taste good .. she said that it was terrible!   Like maybe it had spoiled.   This restaurant needs a Chef that knows how to cook !!  We will not go back.

Giving it two stars out of five because of the nice entertainment and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is geared to an older crowd.  Not terrible, not spectacular....

The service is not very good. Our waitress never really checked on us. There seemed to be miscommunication. 

The onion ring appetizer was very good. 

I got the pasta rustico and my grandparents got spaghetti. 

The pasta rustico had a fair amount of mozzarella and although it was quite watery at first, it solidified after awhile.  It was tasty and as you would expect it to be. 

A bit overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"This restaurant is frequented by an older crowd. Right in front of the Windmill Inn and Suites, we visit Tivoli every time we come to see my grandparents. They used to have an awesome happy hour, but they don't now, and they've raised their prices too.

The chicken wings are good, but most of the menu is pretty hit or miss, with a lot of mushy, bland food. The service is usually good to great. It's a good place to take your grandparents, but I don't think we'll be back without them."}
{"text":"Great oldie hang out! Live classic American music and dance floor as well as a \"Sinatra\"  atmosphere. Food is good for the price, would compare to Olive Gardens. Portion sizes are big. Booze is a bit pricey and there isn't a happy hour. If you're younger it might might not be for you."}
