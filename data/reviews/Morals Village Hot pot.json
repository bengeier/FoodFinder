{"text":"SERVICE : 10/10 Honestly coming in to another hot pot place I would think that they would bring out all your food on the first round and just forget about you after, but no they were really attentive and brought out EVERYTHING I asked for and that's what I like. 

FOOD : fresh meat and veggies. Small portions but you can always order more."}
{"text":"Was in there last night with my family, we were seated quickly and told that they only take cash. The place was decently busy. The person who was taking care of our table was nice to begin with. As the evening went on (we were only there for about an hour) she was less and less attentive and sometimes ignoring our table as she walked by. The food was alright, small portions, not very much to choose from, we had to reorder many times and it takes longer and longer to get our order and the waitresses attention as the times go by. It was the most expensive hot pot I've paid for. Considering the service and the amount of food they served us, it was an experience but we most likely won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Not good as expected. Me and my friends had diarrhea for the whole day after eating there. Craving for hot pot and found it online but so disappointed. Missed many of our orders. Server was not polite and informative. CASH ONLY (is that allowed?) Not worth $40 per person at all"}
{"text":"Food quality: 3.
Service: 1.5 and that's being generous.

Was here on a weekday around 3pm. Our first time in Morals at this location, we ordered the spicy mafia x morals village single small pot specials ($13.99 ea person). Server was so rude and friendliness was practically nonexistent. We made our order, server took it came back a few mins later to tell us 3/5 (or something like that) items were \"sold out\" on the menu... OK. So we settled for the original spicy base, too much oil that it just coats everything and veggies are inedible. It's a good value for the price point, but the service here was terrible. Sauce bar was empty on several items too.

One of us has a shrimp allergy and brought it up; her platter still came out with shrimp. So we asked the server to please remove it, if anything has touched shrimp, there will be a reaction. The server proceeds to PICK THE RAW SHRIMP UP WITH HER HANDS and puts it in another one of our baskets... uh... what? The service was terrible, our server was rude and constantly on their phone, it was hard to get their attention..."}
{"text":"Morals Village is my favourite Hotpot restaurant in Toronto. Mississauga store is their 5th store in Canada. Now, it comes to mississauga, therefore, i wont to take a long way to Toronto to eat hot pot! This store service is great and fast. Food is delicious and the food selection was very great . Also, this is a best place to bring your family or big group as they have those big round tables and a long table that could fit 10 to 15 peoples. In addition, they have different kind of soupbase which are great for those who like to hot pot.  I recommend this place to people all the time."}
{"text":"Will never go there again.
Four of us went there on Sep 24, and on Sep 25, all of us had diarrhea. Have to take some Imodium to stop that.
Moreover, the self served sauces were not fresh at all, the cilantros on the bar were black! Obviously was put there for too long and didn't change.
Overall, very bad experiences."}
{"text":"Went here with my friends for dinner on a Saturday. We made reservations in advance. 

We ordered the large pot. A large pot can be shared between two people. The original spicy broth is amazing!!! Not too spicy! 

Their meat was fresh. I loved the lamb and beef. 

Customer service was awesome. Always checked in on us and if we were doing okay. 

They served ice cream at the end of our dinner due to the high level of acidic in the broth. 

I would definitely go back :) 

For two people, our bill with top came to $85"}
{"text":"This is a chain of Chinese hot pot restaurants in the GTA. The location of the restaurant is easy to find , with plenty of parking  .

Decor : this is a new restaurant so everything is updated contemporary style.

Service : the staff here is friendly and attentive as well they speak English . Since it is an all you can eat , the only issue I had was when ordering items they didn't not bring everything I ordered . 

Food : I have eaten at other location in Markham , this one is not as good. The portions they bring out are very small so you have to constantly order more which can take more time. 

Over all I don't think I would come back to this location to dine ."}

I've been to a few hotpot restaurants before and this is by far my favourite! The restaurant space is huge! The interior is quite upscale and contemporary. 

I love that we get our own individual pots and not a huge one you normally share with someone else like other hotpot restaurants. Don't get me wrong you can definitely share, however, I like the idea of having my own pot.

The food selection was really good, from the toppings/dipping sauces, hot pot items and soup bases. Definitely a lot to choose from!

Our server was really great. She was very helpful with the menu and always topped our water. Later on in the evening though, the restaurant started to get busy so she was a little occupied with other tables which was totally understandable.

Other servers tried to help us but it seemed as though they didn't speak much English. Also, we raised our hand up a few times to get a busboy's attention but he always walked past us. So it was really difficult to get someone to help us. 

That was my only problem about this place, the service was a hit or miss at times."}
{"text":"This hot pot restaurant franchise originated in China with more than 600 stores and since has expanded to Toronto. They currently have three shops in the Greater Toronto Area with a planned fifth shop to open in Ottawa next year! It's an exciting time for hot pot restaurants in Toronto and especially for those who like to hot pot! Hot pot cuisine is when you choose a soup base in your own pot (communal or shared) and then throughout the night, you can boil various meat, seafood, vegetables, and other food items in your pot to eat! You can choose your own condiments to dip the food into too. It is such a comfort food kind of experience and perfect for the colder months of the year. It's always a fun dining experience when you enjoy it with people who love eating and sharing food.

All of our individual hot pots arrived very promptly and our tables contained knobs for us to adjust the strength of the flat-screen stoves as well.  The Deep-sea spicy fish fillet was seasoned with the numbing ma la spice and I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Came in here for a lunch with a group of 8, since it was the holiday season we were given the dinner option, and I do admit my experience with hot pot restaurants is limited, it seemed that Morals has a couple of extra charges in addition to their \"all you can eat\", including a charge for the soup base..and one other thing I can't remember. 
While the food was great, a lunch for just under \"$40\" with service that wasn't great I would sadly have to give this place 2.5 stars, and just happen to be in a mood to round down vs up for my review. 
I do want to reiterate that the food was good, I just wish that service was improved given that there were maybe only 5 other tables in addition to ours that was occupied, and the prices were lower.
I do give them props for self serve ice cream!
I am definitely not opposed to coming back here to try out their lunch menu but I would venture out to the other hot pot restaurant in the same plaza for dinner since they appeared to be a bit more cost effective."}
{"text":"Went again last night with my parents.  They are from Hong Kong and China so they know hot pots. 

We were all very satisfied with the meal. High quality meat, fresh veggies, good balls. Udon and hand cut noodles were great too.  Just that some shrimp was not the best but you can tell and not eat that one. 

For large pots, the seats near the wall on the left side of the restaurant boils faster. 

Our waitress was also excellent. Came back to ensure our tea and water was full, even wiped the wet mark on our table after she poured. 

So it was a great meal , we didn't even mind paying $2 more for weekend price. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Was invited here after a bad experience at the Downtown location. The service here does not disappoint. The staff were all friendly, and very helpful. Within a few minutes of ordering our dishes were out and pot boiling. 

My favorite part about this place is the amazing beef, very tender and tasty. Just the right amount of fat. 

The crispy sausages are especially nice as well, along with the caste majority of their menu. 

Although I thoroughly enjoyed the hotpot, my first target are the fried buns and condensed milk. They are phenomenal here, I highly recommend trying some. 

Also, before I end off, the watermelon juice is the bomb. Don't come here without getting some. ;)"}
{"text":"This is a large hotpot chain originated from China, the service at this location is great, a lot better than the Markham location. It is a --cook it your self -- type of dining, basically you pick your soup base and then put thinly sliced meats and other food in it until it's cooked. You make your own dipping sauce from a variety of condiments such as soy sauce, vinegar, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce etc. They offer both single serve (per person) and larger pot (shared). Foods are fresh, and the restaurant is pretty clean. The only weird thing is that the stairs leading to it are very high and steep."}

We came here with a group of 10 people for a friend's birthday. 

The food selection was good, but not as extensive as other places. What they did have, was of good quality.

The cost is reasonable, as long as you stay within the AYCE menu. 

The decor is really similar to the upscale places in China and they use PIC cooktops. Some of the tables aren't as easy for sharing but it's still ok to share. 

The service here was good. Always tentative and courteous. My glass of water never stayed empty for long, and the empty plates didn't stay on the table long. 

The place is very clean, maybe due to being new, but they look to be quite thorough when you watch them. 

A great place for hotpot and the flavours are great. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went to Morals Village for hot pot with some friends.   There were 5 of us and we got two large pots to share.  We got a large table for 6 so there was a lot of space for everyone.

A few things to note about Morals: 

1. This is probably standard practice at hot pot restaurants.  They will charge you one price for all you can eat hot pot, then charge an additional price for the soup base.  Remember to factor in the soup base price into your budget!

2. Morals has a very nice sides and sauce area.  There were tons of choices from sesame to hot sauce to sha-cha.  You can even crack a small raw egg and mix it into your hot pot sauce!

3. Drinks are not included in the ayce hot pot price.

Noted points aside, the hot pot food at Morals village was excellent and I thought the quality on most food items were great.  We ordered a bunch of meat (pork, beef), lots of seafood (shrimps, scallop, etc) and a big variety of veggies (napa, winter melon, tofu, mushrooms...) and everything was service neatly in nice dishes and nothing was missed.  Generally speaking, the food we ordered came promptly.

To top things off,  the dinner menu has ice cream desserts for everyone after we were all too full to eat anymore.

The verdict.  Morals village is great place for hot pot.  A little bit pricy but you get high quality food and solid service for a enjoyable hot pot experience.

4.1 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Every broth has Chinese's peppercorns in it and they were very very overpowering! Stomach turned while I was still in the restaurant......all five of will definitely not go back :S"}
{"text":"Decided to take my mother here for thanksgiving, and as her first hot pot experience, I feel slightly embarrassed I over hyped the idea to her. Not saying every hot pot will have this experience in general, but it's this location. 

The ambience and restaurant look is modern and great. 
The quality of your food is great. - thus the two stars. 

The service is not great. 

We waited about 25 minutes for someone to take notice of us to place our order, clearly they were so busy chatting behind the bar and minding their cellphones. I had to ask for service. 
We never received the waters we asked for,  until I went up myself to ask for it at the bar in the back. 
Our server came ONCE to drop off our food, never came by again to check in on us OR LET US KNOW WHEN LAST CALL WAS - We wanted more food as we order minimal items first as we pace ourselves at an all you can eat. Prior to this we asked a different server, Chloe, if we could place two more dishes. With such pristine attitude she told us last call was at 10 pm (it was 10:15pm) and she begrudgingly suggested she ask her manager. Unfortunately not. 

There was no god damn ice cream left.

Question yourself first if the 30 dollar (plus extra charges for drinks and soup base) and lack of customer service is worth the price."}
{"text":"I always go to the location at Chinatown but since i was in sauga, decided to hit up this location. My first assumption was that this location cant be better than Chinatown location. I was wrong, most foods was fresher with the exception of the mussels and marinated beef. It was not jammed packed like Chinatown location and you can expect to be seated promptly on a weekday night. The pots and food arrived in good order in timely fashion.

The sliced meats were especially good. The sauces were well stocked. The place was clean, staff was courteous and constantly filling up soup, water or whatever. I really enjoyed this hotpot and I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Returned for a second time last Friday and it was a much better experience.  The quality of the food was good.  The shrimp was fresh and the shrimp wonton was flavourful.  The staff was attentive to check on us if we needed to order more food and was helpful when I inquired about some of the food items.  The mussels took two orders before they arrived, but not a big deal, most places misplace orders here and there."}
{"text":"Pretty good variety. The waitress had issues with understanding English.. they also kept forgetting items. Overall I like having the variety and my own pot."}
{"text":"A little pricier than the hot pot restaurant nearby, but the meat quality is better,maybe? Or they just put the meat on the plates nicely? Flavour of the soup was all right. But honestly, I would go to the other hot pot restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre, food is ok. I mean how can you really go wrong with food at hotpot? Soup bases were good but the service was slow and they were kind of rude, and don't forget to check the bill before you pay because 15 percent of the gratuity is already added. (Probably because of their shitty service they knew they didn't deserve tip)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the place. Missed out on a Friday night because they do not seat people after 10pm even though they close at 12am. Their last call is at 10pm. Came back on a Sunday night, the place was full. There was a wait but it wasn't too long, about 5-10minutes. 

I like this restaurant franchise because they have a greater variety of soup bases and food available. But at this location the beef was not as soft as others, it was pretty dry. The beef cheese ball and the shrimp balls are still really good. The vegetables are really fresh. 

The service was really slow; the food was not as good as expected. They skipped a lot of the things we ordered and we had to order it multiple times before it came. 

As for the washroom, it was very messy and could have been better maintained. 

We prefer their other locations better because we had a better experience there.  

P.S. Cash only !"}
{"text":"Food quality is good but the service is by far the rudest amongst the hot pot places I've been to.

They are clearly understaffed and a lot of times has 1 waitress to look over half of the restaurant. The waiters don't take food orders. 

We ordered the item multiple times as we've never got the quantity we wanted. They kept on promising that it will come but it never came as the \"kitchen staff didn't want to do it for you because you ordered too much\". 

At an all you can eat restaurant this is the service we got?  First round we ordered 3, 2 came.
Second round we ordered 3, 1 came.
Told them that we would want more and ordered 6, 1 came. 

So in the end we only had 4? We had 3 ppl on the table so  1 1/3 each will considered as too much food! 

Ridiculous. 

I will never return to this location. 

So much for their 4 year anniversary promo."}
{"text":"Cute spot. My husband and I shared a small pot and it was ok but most people had a small pot for themselves. The options were good and well presented. A good experience."}
{"text":"First of all I think the quality of food is better than the Little Lamb. I will give the credit for that. 
Our waitress was very polite and nice. (I guess we got lucky)
However, they do need to improve their customer service tho. 
1. I was trying make reservation, after tried thousand times (around 430pm on Tuesday), finally someone be able to picked up the phone. 
2. They missed couple of our dishes towards the end. (we were full anyway not a big deal in our case) 
For 4 of us, we paid $35/person include tips. 
Since they just open for business, I give them some slack. Definitely give another try in the future. 
p.s they only accept cash for now."}
{"text":"Giving this place a 3.5/5 star.  It's a pretty spacious restaurant and is very clean.  Coming here I was slightly sick so no one wanted to share the broth with me lol.  So it was great that you can individually get your own broth and have your own flavour (they have lots of options).  The service was mediocre, we did have to wave down the server a couple times to get their attention and it wasn't busy at all.  Food was great, very flavourful.  Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"First off, if you don't speak Mandarin, don't go here. More on that later. Upon arrival, you register with an iPad, which takes your phone number and texts you a poorly written text message welcoming you. Once your table is ready you get a call from the restaurant and they basically are yelling at you in Mandarin. I have no idea what they were saying but I figured that was my queue to claim my table. Once you sit down, you are given a menu of all the food choices... in Chinese. If you want an English menu, you have to ask for one. Now comes the fun part of ordering. Our waitress didn't speak a word of English and kept talking to me in Mandarin. Unable to tell her what food we wanted, we resorted to Googling Images to show her the meat and vegetables we wanted. Once the food arrived, it was actually quite good. The soup base was a little bland but that can be fixed by the sauce station they have. For round 2, we had to specifically ask for an English-speaking waiter; which took 15 minutes for them to find. This restaurant has potential, but the language barrier keeps it from awarding any more stars as the service experience was horrid. It's nice to have a second hot pot restaurant in Mississauga. I'll be back in a month or two and hope the staff have some people who can speak English. But for now, the food is the only thing this place has going for it."}
{"text":"AYCE Hot pot, big space so its good for group of people. 
I like the personal hot pot.   Little pot can pick two different soup basic for yourself.

This place has big parking space, nice interior design, and it is very clean too."}
