{"text":"Celebrated a friends bday here, it was a great fun time. Service was perfect, very attentive! Cocktails are delicious, they were also able to make virgin cocktails for the ones not drinking which tasted amazing ! Dinner was perfectly timed, very tasty! Flavours well balance (thank u for not piling food w salt) and desserts were unique and divine! Wine selection has a lot of great choices! Also whisky post dinner options.

Very happy with my experience here! Beautifully decorated. Very trendy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite trendy and well decorated in a refurbished industrial building. 

We were a group celebrating a birthday. A 60$ set 3 course meal was offered.

First course, the mozzarella Di buffala. Half a mozzarella ball served on big chunks of tomatoes. The first course was refreshing but with no sparks. Then again, hard to miss mozza and tomatoes.

Main dish, I had the salmon filet which was served uncooked. The plate was returned and it came back cooked ok. Flavours were not harmonious. And the plate lacked visual aspects. 

Desert was their most popular and signature desert. Seemed like it was a hazelnut cheesecake. The taste was very good. However, it was served half frozen as it was not thawed in time. And no coffee was offered at desert time.

Service was ok. Our waitress did all she could. She was nice and gave all she had. But the restaurant left her alone to serve a group of 30...not well played on their part for this. So 5 stars for the waitress for service but 1 star for the restaurant.

Unanimously, no one of our group will be returning to this restaurant. Overrated is an understatement."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Fun cocktail and wine list. Great place for a night out with friends!!"}
{"text":"Le Richmond Brunch experience does not deliver on the quality expected for the price tag. 

For the good, the Lobster Benedict was tasty although I was expecting a larger lobster portion for 24$. Our waiter was courteous but not very responsive considering the restaurant wasn't busy, leaving empty plates on the table and making us wait for the bill for a while after we finished our meal. 

For the bad, we ordered the French toasts which were supposed to be served with fresh fruits and came served with diced watermelon on top instead. Clearly disappointing. The mimosas are well made but way overpriced at 15$ a glass. Finally, we could observe the kitchen staff doing a bit of fist fighting for fun and one of the chef scratching his beard just before cooking. Not very professional for this type of establishment. We were underwhelmed and will not be returning for the Brunch."}
{"text":"Menu de groupe limité et beaucoup trop cher pour ce que l'on reçoit. On en ressort encore affamé et déçu."}
{"text":"Unreal food, excellent atmosphere, charming staff. I had the best french toast I've ever had here, and the dinner menu was scrumptious. It's a real Griffintown gem! The only drawback was the ridiculous prices for their market section."}
{"text":"Had the Charcuterie appetizer and their signature le boulevardier drink (which is a party in itself) and then the risotto. Was a fantastic meal and my guests were equally pleased with their dishes. Really swinging on the Thursday night we were there."}
{"text":"If you enjoy overpriced salads and parts of animals that should never be eaten (cheeks and hearts) then this restaurant is for you. If you have normal tastes and expectations, DO NOT GO HERE! I ordered Sea Bass that came drenched in olives and salty olive juices...The word Olive was not on the item description once! Suffice to say I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"I went a couple of times, food is very good (especially the charcuteries) but overpriced. the place is nice and great ambiance. The only thing that turned me off is 3 times out of 4 they charged extra drinks on my bill. Make sure you check your bill before paying."}
{"text":"I've tried the brunches there and they are amazing. 
The lobster omelettes and French toast are both a treat.

For lunch, seafood risotto, salmon, T-bone steak are all good choices. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and beautiful crowd but I had to ask for and add salt to my steak and eggs brunch; never a good sign when food isn't seasoned by the chef.  Fun for drinks and people watching."}
{"text":"1 star is even too high. Went there for the second time and was seated in a private area which I had reserved for a special occasion. They decided to sit a huge groupe beside us who took over our space. We were also asked to be moved. We spoke to the manger who did not care because we were only there for drinks and appetizers ($200 worth). Unfortunately we decided to go somewhere else where they would appreciate our money. Food is overpriced for what you are getting and I am not stingy when it comes to food. Service was obviously horrible from A to Z. Food took forever to get to our table and had to flag down the waiter every single time We needed something."}
{"text":"Absolutely revolting service. I don't care how good you think the food is (it's not that great)- the customers service is abysmal. I am disgusted. This place is destined for failure. For a supervisor to speak to a client in such a manner is shocking... 0 stars was not an option."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, wonderful service, fantastic drinks, nice lounge area and love the chandeliers. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So i took the time to investigate further into sous vide cooking and bought a machine myself.  After repeatedly cooking pork chops I feel that I cannot ding the restaurant for their food.  However I maintain my previous opinion on how critics are handled."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor but unfortunately for me this was not a good experience. I reserved a private area for 2 for a special occasion. Despite our reservation agreement, they managed to shove an over crowded group beside us and actually asked us to move. We were ignored by our waiter all evening so we decided to eat somewhere else after dropping $300 on appetizers. Was able to speak to the manager who rudely ignored our concerns. Guess we didn't spend enough!!"}
{"text":"Great meal, great service. Alexi was fantastic as was our server and the whole staff. They fully accommodated my children and my wife and I with all our requests. The lamb, steak, charcuterie plate, burratta were exceptional. I highly recommend this restaurant and the bar scene was great with lots of action."}
{"text":"Always Love it here! Every time just good times. Good food, cool staff. Love sitting at the Bar. Best times, this summer, so far, were here!"}
{"text":"I wish the scale went to seven. This is my favorite restaurant worldwide. 
The food, music, atmosphere and service were firing on all eight. 

The fruit soup was amazing, like a healthy fruit gazpacho. 
The octopus appetizer almost had me out of body. 

Try the spicy spaghetti lobster was like nothing I've ever had, but have been looking for my whole life. 

I drink a lot of espresso all over the place but this was the best I've ever tasted. 

Service was perfect. Great crowd, cool lights and bar

Very busy, even late at night. Call ahead. 

If in Montreal, go there!"}
{"text":"Went for supper last night with a group for a friend's birthday.  Wonderful!  The restaurant is just stunning, the food fresh and excellent.  I started off with an amazing litchi martini, had a pear and pine nut salad that was very tasty and fresh pasta with fresh tomatoes (their vegetarian dish). Dessert was lovely with a few small cookies and sweets and a great cappuccino.  Servers were attentive, polite and on point.  Fabulous evening enjoyed by all!  Will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my most favorite restaurants in the city. My favorite dish is the tartare by far. I love tartare and they are just the absolute best for this dish. Their pasta's and meat dishes are always on point as well. The restaurant itself is also beautifully decorated and such and is a nice place for a romantic nice out. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Service ok. Carré d'agneau excellent. Risotto au homard correct. Service de sommelier très bon. Décor très réussi."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour le lunch. Une belle et généreuse table d'hôte à 25$. La cuisse de canard vaut le détour. Excellent service"}
{"text":"Do not come here. Awful service. Dinner took 3 hours. Very rude waiters. 

So not worth it. French or English :)"}
{"text":"Went here for NYE and we had a blast! Food was superb and service was phenomenal. Absolutely love the look and feel of this place. The owner was very nice and personable and really made us feel at home. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back during my next trip to Montreal. cheers!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in Griffintown, this is probably one of my favorite trendy spots if I feel like splurging. The decor is gorgeous, lighting, artwork, everything is on point. I've been here awhile back for a date and I remembered the food to be really good, so when my sister was visiting from BC, it was the perfect opportunity to go back again.

Good : The beef tartar was a stand out dish for me...and the spicy lobster spaghetti. That sauce is amazing, but it comes with a hefty $38 price tag. The service was okay, it was a bit busy so I was understanding that it would be a bit slow. Oh, and that chocolate cake! A bit steep at $15 for a small piece, but it was really delicious.

Bad : Trout gravlax...quite frankly just tasted like smoked salmon sliced. I wasn't blown away. The octopus appetizer wasn't that good either, I was a bit disappointed because it kinda looked and tasted like sliced turkey cold cuts. Don't get that.

Bottom Line : If you want to impress your guest or date, this is the spot. It's a very lively ambiance and the food is pretty good too. Will return."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Just food was a little bland. For the price you're paying you expect a treat for your taste buds. I've had better tasting food from fast food places. 
Needs a revamp of the menu maybe a new chef."}
{"text":"Went to this place with 4 buddies to celebrate a birthday. The atmosphere and decor are fantastic! The rear part of the restaurant has a huge retractable roof that opens up to give a terrace feel to it.

The servers were very courteous and I have to say, beautiful! We had the octopus appetizer, fennel salad, seafood platter, rack of lamb, and a dessert platter. Everything was excellent.

I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love their terrace. The service is no longer like before. To have a drink is mandatory to have a meal but to have a meal, you better reserve couple of weeks in advance.
The menu also change often, so if you found something that you ate and loved, it won't be in the menu again the next time you come :-(("}
{"text":"Went for my Birthday, it's definitely a picture perfect with great service. Had the salad as entree and it  was bland, bread was  on the dry side. My main meal was the rack of lamb, once again lack flavour...I love trying new places out and for the price this was not up to par. Oh I forgot the dessert was wonderful which was the spice cake!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with the hospitality.  My father and I  arrived at the restaurant early to meet a group for dinner. They could not find our reservation so they told us to wait at the bar while our party arrives. We walk to the only bar looking area, outside as the other region was a diner counter.  There was a private party adjacent and thought it would be reasonable to sit at the bar per their recommendation. A rigid rude woman comes, not the host who greeted us at the door, and tells us we are not with the party and we cannot be there. 

I would assume that the \"front of the house\" staff would be polite and tactful for such a beautiful restaurant.  I was VERY WRONG.

Luckily we realized we had missed an email of change of venue and could leave this acrid place.  Glad to give our money to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Le Richmond is Crazy/Sexy/Cool! I was completely surprised by the laid back, yet stylish ambiance. The crowd, the lighting, the art, the servers, the plating, the music...all led to one heck of a night. 

As for the food, my steak tartare arrived at the table completely raw...and I loved it! Everyone at our table of five loved their meals. Apparently, some people eat cooked meat. Who knew?

Not one to try specialty cocktails, I went for the classic martini, but my dining partners tried 'off the menu' cocktail concoctions. I can't remember the name, but the one with thyme was amazingly balanced and delicious. (Yes, we all shared our drinks. Don't get grossed out. Alcohol is naturally antibacterial.) 

I will definitely go again to Le Richmond. Next time, I'll make sure to try something that is actually cooked to update the review. 

As a note, be sure to check your bill. The next morning, we noticed that we were incorrectly charged for a few things. My mother always warned me to check the bill after a meal. Hey, Mom, after all the cocktails...we could barely sign the bill let alone read it."}
{"text":"Went there for maple brunch and was not disappointed. The food was very good and the ambiance chic but relaxed. I will have to go for dinner to test their full menu but I really enjoyed the concrete jungle cabane a sucre they created. As I do not necessarily enjoy going to a cabane a sucre, I love maple and Le Richmond has done an excellent job with this brunch."}
{"text":"This place is terrible for the price, we waited over 2 hours for the food to come like if you wanna waste time here yeah but if you wanna enjoy a brunch and the food comes 2 hours late, to be honest the food need more salt and pepper at least because it was really bland and the meat had too much fat in it."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant on street Richmond in Montreal (Griffintown). The architecture is quite interesting, food and service are good; nothing incredible, yet I would be more than happy to go back with a group of friends. It is a \"noisy\" place, so if you're looking to talk, or go on a first date, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant; Pullman is a much better place to talk ; )

Additionally, it looks like a dressed-up place, but I was more than comfortable with my jeans and T-Shirt. Yes this is a little \"did you see me there\" (trendy) place, but still would recommend it as they know how to make proper drinks.

Remember, this is a restaurant, if you want a drink you need to order food ; )"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was phenomenal. Great interiors, artworks collection, music, and vibes. There were 14 of us girls and they set a beautiful table. The drinks were superb. But unfortunately the service was weak. Drinks and food came really late. The food looked very nice but was bland! I would say if they change their chef and improve on the taste if the food, the experience would be amazing! All in all the atmosphere and drinks was great and recommend this place for drinks."}
{"text":"I have only been to this place for Sunday brunch 
The first time I had an amazing lobster egg Benedict 
That wasss mesmerizing
I went back this year and they had changed the menu obviously 
I had the foie gras torchon with a figue jam
You can never go wrong with that 
Salmon gravlax and proscuitto egg Benedicts 
The highlight for me was the caramel budino which is like 2 little donuts in a bed of praline cream 

Cons:The portions are small 
Pros: great service and beautiful setting"}
{"text":"Sublime ambiance a la fois décontractée et chic. Service impeccable et discret . Excellente cuisine lors du brunch cabane a sucre. J y retournerais!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant / bistro / market. In terms of service the Richmond is as good as it gets. Staff there are fantastic and the reason I keep going back. They are curteous, polite, always around when you need them. The food as well is very impressive. Always enjoy the pizza and salads. I love going there to grab a quick coffee on my lunch break. I would highly recommend for business lunches (free valet during lunch hours) or just to go with friends & family. I have yet to try a dinner service or 5@7 there but spring is coming and its where I will be headed."}
{"text":"Very interesting blend of a deli, a a sit down restaurant with wine, and a store front. They made it work. The take out menu is great and very tasty. While waiting you can explore what they have on offer in the store, it was hard to see it all.
Prices are good as well.
Definitely stop in if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I am really surprise this restaurant is three stars. I was there on a sugar shack weekend Event with my girlfriend. We took the special sugar shack at 11 am to 1h30 pm.  

We were late about 22 min, the restaurant sent us a text message asking us if we still want to reserve a table. 

When we got there, the lady took our coat To the hanger and we proceed To sit on our table. We ordered a mimosa before our meals. 

After, we received our pea soup. The pea soup was a little bland at first, they added mince porcs on top so it will taste better. We couldnt get enough of the soup, it was a hit.  Then came our apetizers #2, the salad with bacon was my favourite, it has this mill and sweet flavor. The ball of mozarella and a slice of tomato was an awesome take without the bread. The mille-feuille was a mixture of foie gras, maple sauce and chocolate. I only taste the foie gras near the end when I pay attention. 

We waited a little bit longer for our main meal. When it came, the waiter excuses for the wait and he proceeds to say: All great food take time. Needless To say, we were eating arts. It was forgiven! We had a mixture of potatoes, large piece of beef, veggies and eggs. We couldnt finish everything because of the quantity of food. It was a fun adventure. 

Now... Come dessert time. We had small slices of pancakes with a lot of cream and slices of cocoa nibs. 

The wait between meals came in about 3 hours and we ended our visit with an outdoor sugar shack where we get To see animals, get our maple taffy and a hot drink (red wine or chocolate). They also have a cotton candy machine. 

The price is not for the faint of heart. We figure it Will be the same price going To a regular shack and renting a car for a day. We get to feel like queens for a day!"}
{"text":"I really really LOVE this place and their decor! Staff is absolutely friendly and super attentive. Perfect place to hang out for drinks, food-not so much. And this is the reason I am giving 3 to them... I've had dinner here more than couple of times and was disappointed each time..."}
{"text":"Started with the beef tartare. Terrible. Looked and tasted like unseasoned ground beef. Next up the mushroom risotto. Was more like a soup than a risotto. All for only $150 with a little wine and a beer. Ouch!"}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday I have to admit I had already  made up my mind to hate the place before going. I imagined the place to be one of those \"trendy places\" that young people with money to burn, go to see and be seen with snotty service and ridicules prices . I have to say I was wrong. the service was excellent, friendly and nice and I did not hate the place. But there stops the good. The prices are way to expensive for what you get both quantity and quality wise. I don't mind to pay and arm and a leg (even two) for a good tasting meal. But the food was no where (not even in the same area code)  as good, to merit such high prices. I would have given the place two and a half star, based just on service but I have to settle for two because there is no half star option. I had a good time but would never go back there unless I win the 6/49 or some rich aunt leaves me tons of money!"}
{"text":"Très satisfaite du service et de la qualité des plats 
Beau décor 
Assez d'espace pour une poussette entre les tables"}
{"text":"It's pricey but delish! Service was wonderful! We had the mozzarella buffalo and shaved prosciutto   was amazing! We had the salmon and lamb for our main meals - both so yummy! 

Ambience is beautiful and I can't speak enough about the great service! Great job Le Richmond!"}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant is where people go to be seen. It was very loud in there. The staff all look like models ... I swear it must be a requirement or something. I went after work on a Thursday and later in the evening there was a dj and the outside terrace was happening! As far as food goes I honestly was not impressed. I had the Angus Pride beef with foie gras, fresh truffle, Yukon Gold mash and seasonal vegetables. For $56 it was not worth the price. I honestly would rather go to Gibbys or the Keg. I honestly don't think I would come back here... Not even for drinks because the bloody caesar was not that good and the crowd is much older."}
{"text":"Food would be pretty good if it was about a third the price. You walk out feeling severely ripped off. Our party of 4, with 1 bottle of liquor, appetizer, main course and dessert came up to $1,275. 

We also got a taste of the rude hostess as many others have mentioned...I must admit she looked tastier than anything on their menu with her tight-a$$ dress, but it must have gone to her head because she unfortunately had the most arrogant attitude. Someone should remind her that she's just a restaurant hostess. 

Back to the restaurant, there are several places around town with similar food where you don't walk out feeling like you got reamed. Between the overpriced food and dumb hostess who gave us attitude, needless to say, none of us would ever be inclined to return to this place."}
{"text":"Fancy deco, good music and very attentive staff. We had oysters, the pasta cavellini with truffles and the the veal. The veal was very good. It came with a rich sauce of sweet potato. The pasta was my favourite. Overall the food was delicious but the portions kind of small. 
It's a nice place to bring your date or to hang out with friends as the music is not too loud."}
{"text":"I was invited to a business dinner with my work and this restaurant was an excellent choice. We were first seated at the bar and had a variety of cocktails to choose from, all of which were presented well and delicious. The bar tender was very attentive. Afterwards we were seating on a table that looked like a dinning hall table, it was very nice. The decor and ambiance were excellent. We were offered a set menu as this was a business dinner and I chose the Mozzarella appetizer with tomatoes and the cavatelli (ricotta cavatelli, wild mushrooms, basil cream, pecorino). It was excellent. I finished my plate. The dessert was a selection of different dessert on a plate. It was all very delicious. The service was great and I would defiantly be back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely beeeeautiful place: chandeliers, huge windows, gorgeous wood tables and heavy bar stools and a really nice, albeit pricey wine list. The staff was super attentive and snappily dressed but the food? I was expecting more.

The starters were quite tasty: perfect pesto and tasty bread, but the mains, although large, were far too salty and almost too creamy (seafood risotto).  The desserts were great, but didn't come out even near the same time for the 3 of us dining which is kinda weird, 2 of us were done ours before the third one came out."}
{"text":"Superbe table de l'Italie du Nord. Plats très bien exécutés, carte assez élaborée, ambiance énergique mais service exemplaire. Il semble y avoir de la place pour une belle terrasse. La salle est superbe, chaleureuse mais dégagée. J'ai l'impression que ce spot aura du succès."}
{"text":"Being a big group (12 people) we were forced to take the set menu which was VERY limited in choices. 
All the waiters had a shitty attitude and were very disrespectful
The salad had no seasoning, the salmon tartar was bland
I'm definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. A bit pricey perhaps, but the ambiance more than made up for it. Steak...seafood...dessert...everything is good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few weeks ago and was severely underwhelmed, especially given the hype I've heard about this place.

The Salmon tartare was loaded with citrus and the overall flavour was overpowered by that taste. Really disappointing. Nothing notable to say the drinks. 

The hostess was also very rude to me. I walked in wearing a floppy wide brimmed fashion hat as it was kind of raining, and before even greeting me properly, she told me that I had to remove it. Like hello, obviously I'm not going to wear this hat to dinner , even though it's super cute. She was probably just jealous that she didn't had a cool hat like mine lol. 

There are much better restos in Griffintown like Grinder , Foxy , Moretti Pizza etc. Don't waste your time or money here."}
