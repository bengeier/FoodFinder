{"text":"Was in the area and needed to get takeout for dinner. 

Ordered the chicken shawarma, which came with a side salad and rice. The portions were very generous, but I thought the taste was a little off - someone mentioned that a lot of cumin was used so maybe that was it. 

Also ordered the baba ganoush which came with a laffa, which was pretty good. One laffa was definitely not enough for the dip though!"}
{"text":"For $6.99+tax you get a pita full to the brim with Shawarma and humus, salad etc. 
Fresh a d filling.  This guy rocks!"}
{"text":"One of the best laffas I have had.  Had the chicken sharwama bc they didn't have the lamb today.  Lamb would have been even better I think.  The chicken had a lot of flavor and they let you choose from many authentic toppings.  

The only thing they need to improve on is how to wrap the laffa tightly."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh! I work close by and phone my lunch order in at least twice a week. I often order the entree meal with chicken or kefta kebob with a side of rice Megadara and the house salad. The entree is enough for two people as the portions are huge so I have lunch for two days and still can't finish! The laffa sandwiches are insanely huge and if I have one for lunch I skip dinner. The laffa is wonderfully chewy and I question another posters reference to the laffa being bland. Every time I place an order my co-workers ask me to pick up a few extras for them...it's bread for god sake and they love it. The falafels are the best I've ever tasted. Nicely seasoned with a crunchy exterior and lovely soft inside. The Israeli salad is as it should be, tiny diced veg with good flavour and so healthy. Hassan, the owner is a delightful guy with an easy smile and very caring of his customers. Mr. Laffa opened just in time as Sofra down the street (that I used to frequent) changed ownership and the quality of their food went south. Hooray for Mr. Laffa, fresh food with a smile!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in GTA. 
Great hummus as well - you can get it with all kind of add-on like shawarma or tahini 
Portions are large and taste is great. 
This was a surprise place and if you are thinking \"another Laffa place\" you are so badly wrong. 
The attitude of the owner / chef is yet another reason to stop by - one of the nicest restaurant owners I met - one that understands food and special his food and enjoy making and serving it. 
I was already back after the first time for three additional tests with my spouse and without - same results --- EXCELLENT !!"}
{"text":"The laffa bread are fresh and tasty. Service was a bit crazy when we were there. But  portions are big."}
{"text":"Everything's made to order. Laffa shwarma is fantastic. Generous portions. In-house baklava is decent."}
{"text":"It had so much POTENTIAL...but we were very disappointed.  The food was ok considering there are so many similar dining options in the neighbourhood.  

The service was atrocious.  Our server forgot about our order and after 30m we had noticed that other tables were getting their food and we weren't.  We pointed this out and received no apology or empathy from the staff.  It was obvious that the staff did not how to handle what was a busy friday evening.  No compensation was offered.

I recommend Sofra over this establishment any day!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Top notch pita, freshly made. A little hectic at lunch times (especially being near Stephen Lewis). Very tasty shawarma.

As has been said before, however, the service falters. The servers all seemed annoyed, unpleasant, or unnecessarily curt the multiple times I've went here. Still, worth the visit."}
{"text":"Shrimp salad came with only shrimp, iceberg lettuce, carrots, and onion - not all the good stuff described on the menu. One chicken laffa came without the requested cabbage and tomato, the other came without the requested lettuce. Diet Coke instead of the regular I ordered. Not cheap, either."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I've had the shawarma, falafel, hummus, beef and chicken kebabs, but the star is the laffa.  Mister Laffa earns his name by making his laffas cooked as you order in a traditional tabun oven. The laffas are crispy on the outside with a nice soft interior texture. Everything he uses is house made. Sure you can get the same type of food cheaper elsewhere but I think it's worth paying a little more for quality."}
{"text":"With the new owners the place went all the way to 2 stars. The meat is dry, the salads not fresh as used to be. And the service accordingly to the food is not so good. Hope the owners read this review and will do something about this place."}
{"text":"Another one of the places that opened in the great laffa craze of '13.

Humus - superb.
Falafel - awesome
Kefta kebab - Dope !

A notch above the rest -better than mi vami / sofra - both seem like a watered down version of israeli / mideast food. 
And the vibe is calmer than dr. Laffa."}
{"text":"May be there is something wrong with my taste buds, but I honestly don't understand why people enjoy Mr. Laffa so much and write all these great reviews... This place is in our neighborhood, so we went there twice before writing it off the list. The laffas were tasteless and dry, the dips were of the same quality as prepackaged food at Longo's, yet the place is always packed with people...? I think Hanna's Shawarma is much better than this place, it is marginally more expensive but the food certainly tastes better."}
{"text":"Casual Mediterranean food spot with limited seating inside. The food is way above the standard of the type of restaurant it is. Exceptional quality and taste, very friendly staff and quick service. The prices are very fair for the quality & quantity of food you get. The felafel's are made fresh when you order them, they defy the physical norms of what falafels should be capable of being!! The outside is so crispy for how tender and soft they are on the inside it is literally mind blowing. The meat is clearly marinated in some kind of Godly elixir of tenderness and succulence. And the laffa bread... don't get me started I sometimes go to sleep dreaming of this bread. No words can describe it. It is otherworldly. Ultimate perfection."}
{"text":"When any establishment uses Cumin generously it means the food is questionable. Mister Lafta uses it too generously. When I asked why they add so much the waitress shrugged her shoulder and smiled.

I didnt even want my family to eat the chicken after tasting it. Tabulli didnt have tomatoes. Humus and fries were okay.

Definitely not going again. The reviews appear to be from employees."}
{"text":"Pros: All the food tastes really good. Good location and menu. They make the laffa fresh and right in front of you. The schnitzel & shawarma is amazing, I definitely recommend it. Overall, it's a great place.


Cons: The Caesar salad isn't that great, quantity over quality. The lettuce is too thin (isn't crunchy), doesn't have real slices of cheese, the dressing is too thick and not spread evenly (clumps of sauce in the lettuce), and no croutons. The mashed potatoes were horrible, I once got half a potato (raw) in my mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"We love our middle eastern cuisine so soon after Mister Laffa opened we decided to try it out. 

Big disappointment. The only thing we enjoyed was the rice and lentils and hot sauce. The chicken shawarma was bland. The laffa was average. The dips were awful. Especially the eggplant dip. It was a saucy mess with very little actual eggplant. 

I would recommend Sofa Grill over this any day, if you're looking for tasty middle eastern food. 

The service also left much to be desired. Staff could be friendlier."}
{"text":"Warning!!! Raw meat is being served. 
Picked up a shawarma there, the meat looked almost burned from the outside (the roll) but after few bites I noticed the meat is a bit chewy , I decide to have a closer look and noticed some pieces are not even cooked!
Pictures worth a thousand words. 
Avoid."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a take out chicken shawarma in laffa. Very fresh, great toppings and the chicken was tender. Great service."}
{"text":"This was an amazing place, unfortunately Hasan (the owner) sold the restaurant and the food is not what is was.
#MissingHasan 
June 2017....Hassan is back!  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered this for lunch today and it's delicious. The pita was extremely fresh, very doughy and soft. Chicken schnitzel was to die for, not greasy at all and breaded to perfection. Seasoned rice was fragrant and flavourful. Falafel was great and the tabbouleh had amazing flavour to it. Although this was my boyfriends meal, I ate a lot of it, it was that good. Will order from them again for myself in the future, and my boyfriend will too."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Chicken shawarma with rice is dry every time I order it, but the salad is good."}
{"text":"This is my second review and this place has climbed from a three to a four star laffa. They addressed the shortcomings since opening by adding a new hot sauce and a green salsa that really improves the flavour in the food. The laffa was so good. I will always recommend going for a freshly grilled kebob over the shwarma that has been sitting all day but I guess everyone has to make their own choice about that."}
{"text":"Just came home from a very bland and disappointing meal. We dined in.

This restaurant HAD been my favourite place for Shwarma Laffa since they opened a year or so ago.  I'm sad to say that tonight will be my last visit.

Lukewarm unflavoured shwarma meat, thin tasteless Laffa. The Laffa bread looks nothing like the photo I just saw on another review.  They've obviously changed it.  Usually the toppings are full of flavor and can compensate when the meat is cold (which has happened once before) but this time I didn't enjoy the toppings either.

My daughters rice was also served room temperature and she didn't enjoy her chicken shnitzel like she usually does. She complained of a funny aftertaste.

We went next door for pizza."}
{"text":"This place makes my all-time favourite falafel laffa and I really can't say enough about it. They do it all right. The falafels are perfect, the laffa is fresh, and there are several quality toppings to put on. Everything I have tried here tastes SIMPLE, FRESH and DELICIOUS. Thank you MISTER LAFFA for providing a quality product for a good price."}
{"text":"I read the reviews of the guys before me and I wonder if that's the same establishment. 
I been here countless times and had most things on the menu and still never had a bad experience or mediocre one. 
It's a smallish place so the service is not super fast but the food is authentic, fresh and delicious.
Hassan the owner is friendly too and usually sends over a cup of turkish coffee and baklava on the house when you finish your food."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience I've ever experienced with a restaurant. I ordered 3 wraps for delivery through a third party app. All 3 were wrong. 

One should have been onion, lettuce, garlic on pita - they put hummus on it (not sure why?)

The second should have been onion, lettuce, garlic and hummus on Laffa - they didn't put the hummus on it 

The third was requested only garlic sauce - they put all toppings (lettuce, cucumber, onion) and forgot the garlic. 

Lastly. The chicken on one of the wraps was raw - when this was discovered we obviously didn't want to eat anything from here. 

We called the restaurant. The restaurant yelled at my mother in law when she called to ask for a refund, and then hung up on her. 

The chicken on her wrap was raw - and they refused to apologize or refund her money. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great food,everything looks fresh and clean,friendly prices, fast service, I will definitely comeback here again.
highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday. It is a walk up and order kind of place. Nice interior place and good service. I ordered the chicken shish kebab white meat entree and it was delicious.

Chicken was cooked very well and this is basically done infront of you. for 16 dollars it is an ok value, got the hot veggies and chicken and also an assortment of all the salads at the salad bar + the laffa bread. 

come here if you want a quick shawarma meal. portions are good.
giving this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great stuff, the chicken shwarama is nice and delicious. The vegetable's are fresh as well, I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The laffa is made to order, the chicken shawarma is tender and juicy. Above all, the owner is such a nice guy."}
{"text":"More of a take out place than a dine in. 

Changed hands a few times, with different owners having varied care and attention. 

The laffa is very nice (fresh and tasty) and the chicken shwarma and falafel are decent. Overall salads are decent, but nothing special. 

Mainly had positive experience with servers. 

Just wish they could improve their consistency."}
{"text":"Probably as close as you can get to quality middleeastern shawarma in the gta. By far the best place for shawarma . The place got renamed to famous laffa after the co owner split from dr. Laffa and this soecific place has undergone \"renovations\" that made the place smaller than what it was before. I'd give it 5 stars if there were more tables to sit and better quality service."}
{"text":"Solid place for lunch.

Looking for a great shawarma, Shawarma and salad and or any other Middle Eastern food?

This place has gotten better over the past few months."}
{"text":"Very good shawarma. They make the laffa wraps there in the restaurant, always fresh. There are not so many good shawarma places around."}
{"text":"Great place. Meat is always fresh and food there is always a pleasure to eat. 
The owner is super friendly and makes you feel like you're at home when you come eat there. I've never had a bad experience yet and I don't think I ever will"}
{"text":"Everything is a-ok! 

Mister Laffa's was recommended to me by a coworker who lives in the area. I visited one evening and found the atmosphere to be a bit odd. Seems like there was a dispute between the business and a customer as there was a police woman inside taking notes of the situation. This doesn't hinder my rating - sh*t happens, I get it.

I ordered a chicken shawarma salad to go. The chicken was a touch dry but still flavourful. The shreds were small, little pieces of chicken shrapnel was scattered atop my salad. There wasn't a shortage of bird on this meal. I asked for turnips and other pickled things, tabouleh, hummus, lettuce, tomato, eggplant, maybe cucumber and topped with drizzled tahini. They were running low on tabouleh so I got the last few scoops. Because of this shortage, the lady told me to get \"whatever I like\", so I did. Then my salad cost me $15... I still paid and ate and was content. But the price threw me off and I wished there was more tabouleh!"}
{"text":"Ordered a shawarma in laffa and a falafel pita. The shawarma was over cooked, over dry meat and the laffa fell apart. I had to use a fork to eat it.
The falafel was really not good - dry and not freshly prepared. The guy behind the counter used pre-made falafel balls that felt like they were there a long time. Also the falafel mix was very dense - definately mixed with flour or something that's not chickpea. Texture like cardboard. 

I never had a falafel I didn't like until I ate this one.

Very disappointed. Next time I get a craving for falafel or shawarma I'm going to go to a different place - lots of good places in the area."}
{"text":"The food was edible, a bit overpriced for my liking because I have had better tasting Shawarma."}
{"text":"When Hassan used to own the place the food and the service where 5 stars! We were there all the time. Unfortunately he sold the place and I have been there 3 times since every time worst than the other, Need a new shawarma place :(

Hassan is BACK! Changing from 2 stars to 4!"}
{"text":"When the privies owner was doing that it was so good every time . I don't think I will come again . Not fresh , not tasty. The pickles look very bad and taste a same ."}
{"text":"I love this place!
The lines can be a bit long, if you go during lunch on a weekday, but they're worth the wait!
I really like how you can choose what vegetables to put in, unlike another shawarma place I've been to.
The food here is delicious, but the only thing that disappointed me is the service I receive sometimes.
The lady who works the cash register is a little rude, and always seems annoyed with me. Also, some of the people who make the shawarmas end up ripping the pita bread, and barely give me any vegetables.
But other than a few unpleasant workers, this place is great!
4.1 stars!"}
{"text":"Good little spot in Thornhill,
I have been taking out from this store for over two years, and never had the chance to actually sit and dine in, due to the small and limited space..
Food is good and kind of average with the other similar restaurants in the area. Kind of a smaller menu though, It would be good to add some additional items.
My favourite is the chicken schnitzel and the bbq beef, they serve their plates and wraps with the Laffa, so this is just wonderful!

Hassan who is the owner/manager of the restaurant does a great job in keeping the place alive and the menu up to standards, he has great customer service skills and a talent in the kitchen.

Free Baklava and coffee on the house at times as well, and they also offer delivery through JustEats."}
{"text":"Very tasty shawarma, plenty of salads, crispy falafel,  delicious kebabs and free baklava  with Turkish coffee on the top of all.
 Friendly staff and fast service. 
 Highly recommended restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"Three strikes and I am done with this place. I visited the place twice in the past for lunch, they open at 11 and I have arrived after 11:30. Both times I was told they had no laffa yet. How can you be Mr. Laffa and have no laffa? Tonight I placed an order online for my families dinner. I arrived 30 minutes later like the email instructed only to find that they did not have my order. Actually, they had my order, they just didn't look at their online system. Place was empty so they had to excuse. I cancelled my order and that will be the last time I go there."}
{"text":"Guys, I don't know about all the haters, but this place was AWESOME! The laffa was delicious and freshly made right before our eyes, all of the salads and fixins were fresh and tasty, and of course, the shawarma was great! Not to mention, for $10, I can't imagine getting more food - our shawarmas were HUGE!

One of the people in our party got the chicken kabob dinner, which included 2 large skewers with a bunch of chicken, a big portion of rice, and a salad or fries (we got the salad). Meat was very tasty and the salad had a great dressing. Overall, it was a good entree, probably big enough to share, but the price was a little steep at $18.

Of course we got the baklava, which is freshly made, and it was also super tasty. Not to chewy or too sweet. I would get it again!

This was definitely a fast-casual atmosphere and it's great for take out, but if you have time, I recommend eating there so that your food is hot and delicious. Oh, and don't forget to get chips (fries) in your shawarma - takes it to the next level!"}
