{"text":"Was excited to come to Super Point tonight since they are having Millennium_Falco to make the special pizza tonight.  On IG, Super Point told people to come at 4pm as there's when they are serving pizza.  When we arrived on time, the waitress told us to come back and we should be open in 15 minutes.  We went back at 4:15 pm, then was told to go for a walk.  We went for a walk and came back, there was a short lineup already.  The waitress came out at around 4:30 saying that we are just printing out the menu and we will open shortly.  We didn't get into the restaurant till 4:45 pm.  The waitress decided to sit everyone at the patio but we didn't want to sit by the sun.  They were able to allow us to sit in the dining room.  So we ordered their specialty pizza with the pepperoni on it and it was thin and crispy.  It tasted really good.  That was the only good part.  As we were sitting close to the oven, we noticed there was only one pizza was coming out one at a time, considered the restaurant was busy.  

We decided to order the second pizza after we finished the first one, knowing that I do have plans after dinner.  I was hoping that we would finish pizza on time and just pay and leave.  After 10 minutes we ordered, we saw how slow the service was and we thought we should cancelled the order.  I spoke with our server and asked to cancel the order, he came back and told his that our pizza was already in the oven.  So about 20 minutes in, our pizza hasn't arrived yet and that's when I became really annoyed and frustrated.  I spoke with the server that I was told that when the pizza will be out and he said it'll be out in a minutes or two.  Then I lost it and told him  I can't cancel my order since it was in the oven and we have been sitting here for about 20 minutes.  I told him that you lied to me in the face and he tried to argue with me by saying it was already in the oven.  I told him that we have plans  after dinner.  He left the table and handed us the bill.  No apologies from the server.  We didn't give him any tips just because the service was so shitty."}
{"text":"I so so so enjoy this place. All the food is amazing, service is fun and the drinks are good. Such a fun vibe too."}
{"text":"This place has pizza. It also has wine. It also has food that is not pizza but that is also good to eat. Sometimes when I go to there I get these foods, but I always get pizza and every time I get wine also. It has a great selection of the wines. There are wines for everybody, and they have enough bottles to go around! One wine they have is so big that it comes with a free pizza to wash it down. Now THATS amore!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour for a table and then an hour and a half for a pizza that never came. Just cancelled the order. This place is another trend on ossington I will not return to."}
{"text":"SUPER disaPOINTed. Came here sat night, had to wait 45 min for a table which is fine but food better be worth the wait, unfortunately it wasn't at the level of other places I've eaten at in this area. Music was turned up way too loud, so what happens is everyone starts to talk louder to hear one another, couldn't even have a decent convo with my fiance sitting across from me without having to lean in. Their menu is underwelming, with items called cheeseburger, garlic shrimp, warm olives, pork & shrimp spring rolls? sounds like items from a cafeteria menu, doesn't make me salivate at all. Ordered the beef carpachio, which tasted mediocre nothing great, and the capicolo and olive pizza, just had no spark, pizza nova would've been better. Much better pizza joints than Superpoint in this city."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat at Superpoint as I am a huge fan of Bar Fancy and loved Chantecler when the chef was there. However, I found Superpoint very dissapointing. When we arrived we were excited to see lambrusco on the wine list, thinking they would have a good quality dry bottle. We asked the waiter if their lambrusco was dry and he assured us it was. When the bottle came to our table we soon realized that it was the sweet Charli they sell at the LCBO for $9.99. Not at all dry and extremely marked up in price. From that point on we waited 45 minutes for our pizza to be served and felt largely ignored by our server for most of the evening."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my party at least a week in advance and received confirmation that our reservation can be accommodated. I was excited to introduce my friends to Super Point because I had come here a month ago and really enjoyed the food. I showed up for my reservation and they told me they could not accommodate my party despite written confirmation of reservation. Disappointed in the service and the lack of effort in trying to accommodate us. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Tony chef's up the meanest slices I've had in the city! Their za is fresh and so complete."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas and pasta. The lamb cavatelli was perfectly cooked and so savoury.service was phenomenal as well But what makes me give this place five stars is the amazing wine list. First off any place any place with lambrusco by the glass is instantly a hit in my books.. . Bubbly dry red wine goes perfectly with a pasta. The SP68 is a wonderful organic Italian red wine to die for. Smooth tunes over the speakers and little pizza lights really make the room cozy. I'll be here every day!"}
{"text":"RUDE!!!!  Will never return! called for a reservation for 3, arrived on time and was pointed to the first table that barely could seat two, asked if we could move to another table that we could see that was empty, reply was no it's reserved for 4, he said \"you called at the last minute and I squeezed you in\" our reply \" if that's the case you should of told us we could of gone somewhere else\" his reply  \"go ahead go somewhere else\" . We then were told they have communal tables in the back that we could sit at , but the host said go somewhere else, we said can we see the tables in the back, walks us back there and we say oh is there anyone back here and his reply go somewhere else, so didn't need to be told again we went somewhere else Pizzeria Libretto!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Yelp will not allow a review with only three words so I have to give it a little bit of a song-and-dance here to get my point across. But hey that's half the fun of what Yelping is is it not?

Located on Ossington strip surrounded by many choices is super point a pizzeria that has slices available, in my quest to continually try something new I decided to pop in and grab a slice. 

For starters if I actually could see what I was ordering I probably would have just turned around and walked out and went elsewhere. 

Only available there was a choice of pepperoni or cheese so I opted for the pepperoni slice. The server grab it from the top of the oven plopped it into the oven and started to heat up my slice for me, collect my money and I waited anxiously to hopefully indulge in a delicious five dollar slice of pizza.

Oh, I was disappointed. Deliver to me with a wafer thin crust so thin, I was incapable of even picking the slice up off the plate. It was super greasy and it lacked pepperoni. Regardless I still finished eating it, and walked away thinking that this slice was overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Super Point is an interesting spot for spins on Italian classics. If you're looking for awesome pizza this is the spot for you! I went for a special occasion and had the rigatoni (pretty good), two pizzas (fantastic) and the garlic knots (crisp in texture but tasted great). 

Good Stuff: The Pizza choices were varied with vegetarian options, and came in two size options at 14 and 18 inches. They do take out at the front counter for Pizzas as well. Additionally, the people beside us in the restaurant ordered an 18 inch and had one half of the pizza one set of toppings and the other half a whole other set, so you can mix and match your pizza. The location is accessible by TTC, and the alcohol options are plentiful for those wine and beer enthusiasts. The food is good for sharing.

Caution: The Pizza options are presented to you the night of, if you or anyone in your party has allergies I would commit to something else on the menu just in case. The restaurant is super dark, only lit with table candles and some hanging wall lights. The garlic knots had a tough exterior which was quite surprising, they tasted good but the texture was enough for me to put it as a point of caution. The dining room is small so if you are going with more than one person, book ahead of time just in case. The seating along the walls which is the majority of the seating is a tight squeeze, the tables are very close together. 

Overall impression: This place without the pizza for me gets a 3, the service was alright and the ambiance to be quite honest was confusing due to the low lighting and decor choices."}
{"text":"Currently my favourite casual restaurant in the city. 1 appetizer, 1 pasta, and 1 salad is enough for 2 people- all very reasonably priced. The bill will creep up with cocktails, but they are very well made. 

Favourite dishes are the lamb/white wine gnocchi and the shrimp spring rolls.

A nice 1-2 punch is having a drink at Man of Kent next door before dinner."}
{"text":"Walked in without a reso at around 7:30p on a Saturday, which is risky business to start with, but the host used his customer service skills and accommodated us! BOOM point no. 1.

We ordered a margarita and the sopressata with spicy honey pizzas. Both rocked. Could have had about 12 more pizzas but you know.... public decency ;)"}
{"text":"As Bar Fancy's #1, I was pretty excited to try Super Point for the first time this past week. Walking in, I felt right at home with the mood lighting and happy diner everywhere. We ate in the back section- four of us got a table right away around 7:30 on a Thursday night. 

For the meal, we ordered the shrimp and pork spring rolls and it was no trouble for them to add a fourth roll for us. It was nice n' crispy spring roll with very tender shrimp in the centre, surrounded by spiced pork meat. There was also sweet chili sauce on the side, noted: they gave us an extra dipping sauce since we were four people. We also ordered a special of the day - a chicken parmigiana dish. No pasta, it was two large pieces of pounded out fried chicken over a bed of tomato sauce with dense mozzarella cheese on top and generous sprinkles of parmesan. Heaven, and we all got nice and big pieces. 

The showstopper was definitely a large pepperoni pizza. It was a healthy eighteen inches and just the aroma alone could knock you out with happiness. It almost has a garlic bread-like scent? No one minds. Nothing to mind here. The tomato sauces is sweet and plentiful. The crust is thin and nicely folds in on itself, New York style? Greasy pizza bottom, just how I like it. They also use old school pizza stands so that the 'za is raised off the table. It's an incredibly smart move for all tables and small tables, since you're essentially doubling your table surface by not crowding everything with a giant pizza. 

Win! I must return to try the rest of the menu.

{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the city.  I'm confused about all of the negative reviews here.  The service was friendly, the music wasn't too loud, and most importantly, the pizza was INCREDIBLE."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10
Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 9/10

Though it is a very small restaurant, Super Point packs a super punch in terms of its food, and general experience!

Went on a Sunday night and sat at the bar, giving us full view of the pizza and drink making throughout the night. Ordered a bunch of items, and of course, a pizza (pepperoni). Worth mentionings would be the grilled radicchio salad (so bitter and so good), cheesy garlic bread (exactly as you would expect it) and spring rolls (sweet, tender pork and shrimp with a perfectly crispy outside). 

Pizza is a great size and comes out piping hot. 

A cozy and great addition to the Ossington strip! 

THE BOTTOM LINE: great food in a cozy atmosphere - go go go!"}
{"text":"Superpoint is a lesson in having manageable volumes of music in a restaurant. 

My friend and I ordered a side of meatballs, a pizza, and a pasta. My friend specifically asked what was in the pizza and the server did not mention onions. Which, looking back he MAY have but we definitely didn't hear him. She sent it back. 

My pasta came and it was the wrong pasta. I had said \"beef cheek pasta\" to the server and he somehow heard \"cevitalle\" or whatever the other pasta was called. Again- loud music. 

My friend decided not to have anything after all and just cancelled her order instead of ordering something else. I was still at waiting for my pasta and my meatballs after having sat down for an hour and my friend asked for them to check on my pasta. And then she said that they had cancelled the ENTIRE order per my friend's instructions. And my at this point we were both very very confused because at no point did we want to do that or say that at all. But apparently she heard that we wanted to cancel the entire order so that's what happened. Which would have been fine because it was a genuine misunderstanding. But then she began to blame us and be like \"we threw out $100 in costs of food because of you\" - which (a) no you didn't because our final bill would've been closer to $50, so cost of food would've been lower than that. And (b) we had already explained that we genuinely couldn't hear what she was saying because the music was so loud- so there's no point to kick a dead horse. 

So we just left. I was really looking to try the beef cheek pasta but I'm definitely not coming back here to be blamed for something that occurred out of the music being too loud.

As a blanket statement, I'm genuinely pretty sick of all these hipster, west-end restaurants thinking that they're the light of the earth. No customer should be blamed for a genuine misunderstanding."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I have yet to find in Toronto. While I may not have tried all the other big hitters like Vesuvio over in the Junction, I can definitely say Superpoint has this area locked down for best pizza joint in the Bellwoods area. Have yet to eat there, but as far as taste goes, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had dinner at this Ossington strip hotspot last night and we couldn't believe how good it was! Now, I've been to Bar Fancy before and loved it (that fried chicken, tho) but this was something else! My friend is a bit of a wine snob and even she found multiple bottles that she would want to order. They even have wine from Nova Scotia! Our server was very helpful when it came to selecting a bottle of Ontario sparkling rosé (and I usually HATE Ontario wine) that was fruity but dry and delicious to start. We drank this with the cheesy garlic bread, a Caesar salad and spring rolls (so fun!). 

Now here comes the game changer- that pizza was crazy! Crispy with a pillowy crust, we shared two regular sized pizzas between the four of us and were found wishing we had order two more! We also had the rigatoni surprise, a special for the evening that was soooo good. We drank this with a bottle of frappato that another server (not ours, he seemed to be more \"managerly\" and was a total fox!) assured us was made by a \"badass lady winemaker\". It was light and almost too easy drinking with the pizza! 

We decided to share an order of donuts, another special for dessert and had to order an extra side of the grapefruit custard, it was so yummy. We were quite drunk by this point and were joking around with our server so much that she even brought us complimentary shots on the house! It tasted almost like Jaegermeister but she called it a \"blackbird\" and said it was some sort of Jameson/amaro Montenegro concoction.  

We stumbled down to Bar Fancy afterwards and were treated to some more amazing service and fun vibes, they even moved some people down so we could have seats together at the bar! I wish I had more of that pizza now to combat this crazy hangover. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When a friend made a reso here my first reaction was....great way to flush down 100$ for a meal for two for crappy food in an obnoxiously loud & pretentious hipster joint......boy was I wrong!

Service:4.5/5 friendly and attentive

Decor/ambience: Rustic, garage-chic (if that's a thing).....it's a comfortable/airy/classier version of oddseoul/hanmoto.....still closer to those establishments than Mamakas next door....and fun

Food: ranged from 3.5 (bread balls) to 4 (pizza and everything else (American-Italian with s bit of fusion going on)

Value:4 (corkage is 25$)

Repeat: Maybe 

Great for: Fun date night or hanging out w/a group of friends"}
{"text":"This is for the Parkdale location which I had gotten take out from yesterday.  
I was absolutely blown away at how good the pizza was.  I ordered 2 - the SpicyHawaiian and the Shroom.  Both were delicious especially the Hawaiian on which the pepperoni And peppers were top shelf.  My vegetarian wife loved the mushroom one.  We also ordered 2 Caesar salads which like all have said we're excellent.  Olives were just okay.  Service was so-so (no smile or thank you for the $5 take out tip so I'll skip that next time), and prices pretty rich ($85 all in).  But a real treat, waaaaaay better than my usual go-to's.  Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to Superpoint many times since they first opened. It's amazing how great the food is but service ends up leaving bad taste in your mouth when you leave.


Superpoint offers awesome thin crust pizza and the pasta is a true gem and best in the city. Definitely better than Terroni, Libretto etc. Very enjoyable in the a chill and casual atmosphere.


The service though........ugh. Waiters and bartenders are consistently aloof/cold, ignore customers, and don't make any casual conversation. It's gotten to a point where I crave the food but avoid going and recommending to others. This is coming from someone who frequents Chinese restaurants where the waiters yell at you."}
{"text":"I'm totally biased since the owner we know from when he worked at bar fancy.. this place seems to have a more chill vibe And it's great for grabbing a slice of pizza and a beer after work. Service was very on point and quick the entire night. Prices for drinks were reasonable for beers on tap but standard for any mixed drink options. The appetizers were very delicious and the pizza we got had very nice flavour and pizza sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food at SuperPoint. Avoid the back room though.

If you're looking for some terrific pizza and a whole lot more, drop in to SuperPoint. This hopping spot on Ossington sports an eclectic array of treats served up in a casual setting that's pretty much jam packed. Perhaps a little too jammed, one could argue it's part of their charm. I'd beg to differ. 

Service was delightful, and the food was outstanding. We (7 of us) had a few salads, gnocchi, 3 different pizzas, some appetizers as well. Everything was terrific. If you appreciate a good Caesar salad, go with this one. Great garlicky dressing topped with hickory sticks which make for a great spin on crunchy croutons. 

One word of caution. Don't sit in the back room on a hot evening. That was unfair to do to people paying the same as those up front enjoying the AC. I've heard of \"cheap seats\" before, but those conditions were ridiculous."}
{"text":"Second time at Super Point. Love the Caesar salad, the rest of the food is hit and miss (pastas are great). The service feels weirdly nickel and dimey - last time was significantly underserved on what was supposed to be a 9 oz. wine; this time, ordered the crispy eggplant among our apps but the sauce it comes with isn't right for the dish (a creme fraiche-based Parmesan sauce, that is creamy and quite bland and doesn't really go with the eggplant) and makes the dish a miss. Rather than not eat the eggplant, we asked if it would be possible to get a side of marinara sauce. When the bill came, we were surprised to see that we were charged $4 for a few tablespoons of sauce, which is nearly half the total cost of the eggplant dish itself and doesn't cost the restaurant more than a few cents given the amount of tomato sauce a pizza restaurant has on the ready. Considering that we spent over $100 on dinner for two, this seems short-sighted and stingy, especially given that we asked for the sauce to salvage a dish that wasn't great in the first place. I would probably return, though far less enthusiastically than had they just provided the sauce (and maybe asked at the time that we requested it whether the eggplant was to our liking)."}
{"text":"3.5/5

My friends arrived around 6pm and the place wasn't yet filled but afterwards, it got really busy. We ordered the large garlic knots (comes with 10 pieces, and 2 14\" pizzas: pepperoni and capicollo. The garlic knots came first and they tasted good! No complains. The pepperoni and capicollo pizza came on two stand up racks which is so convenient! They definitely know how to maximize table space without huge pizzas swallowing up the table. The capicollo pizza came with roasted onion, garlic, and fresh basil. Both pizzas tasted good and I preferred the classic pepperoni. However, the pizza was nothing too special and for the price ($18+/pizza), there could be some improvement. It's cool though that they bake the pizzas to order. Water refills were not a problem, washrooms were clean, and service was good.

Side note: the 14\" already has a thin dough base so I can't imagine how thin the 18\" pizza is. 

Warning: protect your pizzas from other customers' sTARES."}
{"text":"This review is actually for their take out only location that opened near Parkdale..

Hubby and I are always on the hunt for better pizza and we happened to stumble upon Super point on a very snowy day. It was empty at this location when we walked in but they had a couple of pizzas selling for the slice. We opted for the cream of mushroom and the pepperoni. Both slices were huge for 5$ and were thin (just how we like them!) They also can make full pizza's for take out as well.

Super clean establishment and decent traffic coming in and out. My only complaint was that my pizza slice was not hot enough for me... wished he put the pizza slice in the oven a tad bit longer. Nevertheless, would definitely be back to try a whole pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Such a cool find. You can see them making pizza in the window. This place is a bar and pizza focused Italian restaurant. 

My friend and I came here for a drink at the bar and the smell quickly had us craving pizza, they all looked delicious. Sadly we didn't get a chance to give them a try because we had other plans so my 5 stars are focused on the excellent customer service, amazing wine that I had and the great smell of pizza. 

I will absolutely be back for the full experience."}
{"text":"Received a hot and tasty take out slice in spite of the chilly reception at the counter. Decent overall, but I'll take authentic VPN over hipster-certified pies any day."}
{"text":"I have given Superpoint a number of tries. For a multiple solo slice to go, for a slice and a drink, and to sit down for dinner.

Pizza is pretty good and it's definitely convenient if you are in the area. HOWEVER, on every occasion, the staff at the pizza oven and at the bar have been straight up rude. Why do you work in the service industry if you don't like people? Why do I want to feel bad while paying you for a meal? I think I'm done now...

My suggestion: Go to Libretto instead."}
{"text":"What a lovely addition to the Ossington neighbourhood! Super Point was recently opened by the same owners that did Bar Fancy. Stepping away from the fried chicken game, Super Point serves patrons a variety of American-ized Italian dishes. Dishes include pizzas, pastas, salads and a selection of shareable items like spring rolls and garlic shrimp.

My personal recommendations would be their caesar salad (topped with hickory sticks), cheesy garlic bread (cheese on cheese on cheese) and the melt-in-your-mouth eight-hour braised beef cheek pasta.

At first Super Point was a very small space, but it recently opened up the back  portion of the building. It's 90s, garage party vibe, funky music and fun servers really add to this place and now even more people can enjoy it!

Important note, if you can't get a table or you want a quick bite, Super Point also does take out pizza...allowing you to enjoy their food wherever you please!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time and I love it. I can't say enough good things. Great service. We get the rice balls every time, and I think they are the best I've ever had. Pizza is thin crust, light and flavourful."}
{"text":"Didn't love the pizza. The crust was good, not too chewy, crunchy enough. However the sauce or other ingredients were really salty! Can't say anything bad about the service."}
{"text":"Their pizza's are on point. Pun intended. - One of my new favorites spots thus far. They have another location in Parkdale on Dunn Avenue it's a little hidden so gotta keep an eye out for it. Also it's only a take out place but they have limited seating. 

I really enjoyed their Margarita or Shrooms pizza. Yes it's called Shrooms. No it's not the drug. ;)"}
{"text":"I was there on a Thursday night without reservation, got a table right away
Had rigatoni with spicy pork, the dish was flavourful 
The service was good can be better 
For the desert I had a freshly baked doughnuts, it was divine
I liked the interior it is cosy 
Will go three again and recommend to others"}
{"text":"Easy walk in, get a slice and go..  Appears to be a bar in the back.
The five dollar slice could be a four dollar slice...
Nice thin pizza. Simple cheese or pepperoni options.
Best review, ever!"}
{"text":"I knew that Superpoint was in the Ossington Area, but it can be easily missed, even if the bright neon sign is blinking in your face. On a Sunday, all I had access to was a counter where pizza was being made in the large stove. For someone who is not aware, they could think Superpoint is the entrance to some super cool hipster arcade.

Nonetheless, after a long day of walking, pizza calls, and it did not disappoint. You have the option to buy a whole pizza or individual slices. For $5 dollars, you get a delicious large slice (which could count for 2 slices) of solid thin sliced greasy and flavourful piece of pizza. There were large slices of meat, coupled with salty olives and a hint of space. Don't wear white... you're bound to get a chili oil on your shirt.

For someone who's not crazy for pizza, I caught myself wanting to go back for more and more bites off my bf's.. conclusion of all this: get your own slice and you will love it."}
{"text":"Honey on your pepperoni pizza?  Really hipsters?  Honey??? Why not put Nutella and caramel sauce on it too?  
Hipsters love stupid things like this, and activated carbon.   Hey hipsters lets put black food colouring in your food and call it activated carbon and you can do \"show and tell\" like we did in kindergarten.
Honey on a pepperoni slice of pizza??  I thought I saw it all."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Jonathan Poon's cooking for quite some time now - had great experiences with Chantecler (both with the original menu and after they changed the menu, before he left) and Bar Fancy. So I was excited to try Super Point.

The place itself has a hipster/retro vibe - neon signage outside, and very dim lighting inside, with a neon pink/purple backlight and mostly-wooden interior. It's cosy- seats about 30-35 people. I think there's a back section too, but it's not visible from the main dining area.

We started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls. They're not your run-of-the-mill skinny Asian spring rolls - these ones are quite thick, with substance. It's a full length shrimp (think like tempura size), which is encased in ground pork and house-made spring roll dough, then deep fried. The dish was served with a sweet and sour chili-type sauce. It was a great dish - hot, crispy, and meaty.

Surprisingly, the pizza was the most disappointing. We ordered the nduja deluxe pizza. It's New York Style pizza, with nduja sausage, fresh mushrooms, and green peppers. The size of the pizza was decent, but I agree with Peter T. - there was a serious lack of sausage! There were maybe 1-2 tiny pieces of sausage on each slice of pizza. The tomato sauce was also quite runny - I would remove a slice of pizza from the tray and sauce from adjacent slices would be leaking slowly onto the tray, like a puddle of water spreading on a table. The crust was cooked well (thin and crispy, not soggy like Pizzeria Libretto tends to get), but it lacked flavour.

We also ordered the beef cheek reginette. This dish was fabulous - the beef cheek was so tender and the tomato-based sauce was not too acidic (albeit a tad salty). The house-made pasta was on the harder side of al dente, but I really like a good bite to my pasta. This was definitely the stand-out dish of the evening.

For dessert, we got an order of donuts and grapefruit curd. The curd was sweet, thick, and delicious, not as acidic and citrusy as I had expected. There were 2 donuts, they're about 2.5-3 inches each, deep fried and are served hot and fresh and dipped in granulated sugar. They were so light and fluffy on the inside. A very delicious treat. 

Service was nice - the servers were friendly and refilled our water glasses often. I would eat here again for sure, but I would skip the pizza and go straight for the other kitchen items, because that's where I think Mr. Poon works his magic."}
{"text":"This cozy-cool, unassuming little \"Italian-ish\" restaurant has one of the best Caesar salads I've had in awhile. The dressing is addictively pungent...so garlicky, so zesty...and who needs boring old croutons when you have crunchy, smoky Hickory Sticks?

We also shared the beef reginette: perfectly al dente ribbons of pasta with tender braised beef cheek in a rich tomato sauce.

Didn't try the pizza, but next time I'm taking a lil tipsy tour down the Ossington strip I'll definitely stop by for a slice from the takeout window.

Quick story: I had read they have a \"secret bar\" in the back, only accessible through the back alley, called SP184. So back to the alley we went, and sure enough, there was a door marked SP184 illuminated by a bright pink light. But the door was locked. So we knocked. And someone answered it, asked us for the password (I said the first thing that came to mind: \"beef ragu\") but he laughed and said he was just joking, and then shut the door. Apparently SP184 is a space you can rent out for a party, but it ain't no speakeasy. Haha oops!!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude service. Wouldn't serve us pizza from the walk up window - with a snarly and \"too cool\" attitude. Why have a walk up window then??"}
{"text":"Super Point is a more recent addition to the Ossington strip. The multiple times that I've wandered by, it's always been busy with a line of people waiting for a table. Therefore, it was a surprise to find it mostly empty on a Thursday night. We were here to satisfy some pizza cravings so we skipped over the paper menu and went straight for the pizza options written on the chalkboard (cheese, pepperoni, hawaiian, mushroom soup, or capicollo with olives). We got the mushroom soup pizza and the capicollo and olives. 

I preferred the mushroom soup pizza over the capicollo and olives. They use a flavorful mushroom soup as a base, and topped it with more mushrooms. If you are a fan of fungi, this is your pizza. The capicollo and olives was also good, but on the saltier side. Both were great as reheated leftovers, even after being tossed into the freezer for a couple days. 

Next time I will try their braised beef cheek reginette pasta which I've heard great things about!! It did look delicious!!"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere great. Mushroom pizza, shusitos and fried dough amazing! Large sopprasatta pizza had no cheese about two inches from end so was quite doughy for price, olives and burrata were nothing special. But oh that mushroom pizza"}
{"text":"Pretty bad service - not friendly. Drinks came out separately from each other (glass of wine and can of beer), pizza was meh and the burrata came out after we had finished our pizza. 

Overhyped!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get out to Super Point, but damn I've been missing out.

Before I get to the food, I should probably note that this is one of those hip restaurants with an almost extraordinarily loud atmosphere and tables that are shoved way too closely together. It's not a super relaxing vibe, honestly.

But the food. My god, the food.

We ordered a few things:

Shishito Peppers (\"Spicy Sichuan Pepper\"): Somehow I'd never tried shishito peppers before this. (Not as far as I can remember, anyway.) I was initially turned off by the simplicity of the dish - it's just a pile of cooked peppers without a dipping sauce - but the more I ate, the more addictive I found it. The peppers are spicy and flavorful, while the char from the grill is nothing short of irresistible.

Nodini (\"Warm Garlic Knots, Rosemary, Parmesan\"): This is exactly what you'd think it'd be and yet it's somehow way better than you'd expect. It's basically small blobs of perfectly-cooked dough swimming in an absolutely addictive sauce. No complaints with this one.

House Made Rigatoni (\"Smoked Pork, Spicy N'duja, Mozzarella\"): Would it surprise you to learn this was also amazing? Every component here works so well and the flavors are pretty much mind-blowing. My one complaint would be that it's an awfully small portion for such a high price point.

Hawaiian Pizza: I mean, it'd be criminal if we came to Super Point and didn't order a pizza. And this thing did not disappoint. I can't remember exactly what was on it (and the website doesn't say), but it's not a stretch to say this was one of the best Hawaiian pizzas I've ever eaten. In addition to the first-class toppings, the 'za boasts a sprinkling of really, really tasty spices that only heighten its addictive nature."}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 10 and we did the Pizza Party menu. It came to $40/person + taxes + gratuity. It was honestly worth it because pizza was unlimited, we had five party-sized pizzas, unlimited garlic knots, arancini, and the caesar salad (which had hickory sticks on top). Incredible palette of food. What really stood out to me was the service, branding and atmosphere, and the Hawaiian and Margarita pizzas.

We came here on a Tuesday evening so it wasn't as busy. But the food was worth it. Go in a large group!! Again, would highly recommend the garlic knots, Hawaiian and/or the Margarita (Or just cheese) Pizza. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Wow,  I can't see where these positive reviews are coming from.  

The pizza pretty bad.  It is New York style.  So it is thin crust,  chewy and a little crispy but not really.  The sauce is just ok... The worst part is the complete lack of toppings.  I had the nduja sausage pizza and I tell you I couldn't see any.  He said it had been scattered around the pizza. I eventually found that each slice had one crumb literally 1/4\" in diameter.  It is a joke.  We complained,  nicely, about the lack of sausage.  We were told that the owner went to NY and this is what he thought it should be like....some blend of whatever.  What it really is,  is bland.  Totally bland.  Milky bland.  In NYC they do Vodka sauce on pizza which when combined with their cheese makes them quite creamy,  but they also put toppings on to spice it up.  Do yourself a favor and don't eat pizza here.  Really lousy.  Libretto across the street is a little salty but blows this away.  Actually a lot of pizza places blows this away.  

The service was completely lack luster.  I got the feeling they couldnt care less about anything...that was their response about our comments... 

My friemd had a Caesar salad and soup which ok and some very hot here chicken.  

On the whole between awful pizza mediocre service and loud music I would avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Food is awesome here, but service wasn't that great. I LOVE pizza so discovering new pizza joints is always a plus. The rigatoni was also really good. The only thing was I felt ignored by the server, and service overall took forever."}
{"text":"Soprasetta and honey pizza is very good and the crust, in my opinion, was perfect. Good balance of salt and crispy!
Unfortunately, we could not get over the piss-poor attitude of the Bartender. He was just too cool for school for us OG hipsters. Yes, maybe he had an ageist 'tude or maybe he was disappointed that we did not order any wine; sorry, but the white wines by the glass are very limited.
Beer, delicious pizza and unsurprisingly bad attitude equaled a 10% tip. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite pizza spot in the area! The crust is the perfect combination of crunchy and soft! Will definitely be getting a slice every time I'm in Ossington!"}
{"text":"Service was great but it was so loud I lost my voice by the end of the meal. That being said I did love the music. 

We got the fried zucchini which was on point and the garlic knots mmmmm. The Caesar salad was topped with hickory sticks (can I get a hell yeah?) and super garlicy in the best way. 
The pasta was fresh and epic. My only letdown was the asparagus it came in what felt like a pound of butter. It was just a bit much. 
Would go back again for sure though."}
{"text":"I love love love pizza and headed to Superpoint for a slice for lunch.  It has been open since October.

It's a small take-out in the front with a couple chairs and a restaurant in the back that's open later in the day.  I ate my slice there.


There were three kinds of slices to choose from and I got a pepperoni slice.  It was okay.  I liked the crust as it was light and crispy.  I'm not a fan of parmigiana cheese and there was some sprinkled on the pizza.

The guy making the pizzas and serving left a lot to be desired.  I wasn't looking for him to be my best friend or anything but he wasn't friendly at all.  For example, when I thanked him, he walked away.  I thanked him again when I left and he ignored me.  Wrong profession to be in if you don't like people, dude!

I'd rate the pizza 2.5/5 and the guy 0/5.

I won't be rushing back which is too bad because I love pizza, it's in my 'hood and I'd read good things about this place."}
{"text":"Okay, we were 5 minutes late for our reservation, we acknowledged it and apologized. Us being late aside, we found the service to be super snotty and inconsistent. 

Firstly, our questions about the beer and cider on tap were regular questions one has when discovering a new item. The server couldn't have been less invested in finding us good pairings for our meal and then acted like it was a HUGE inconvenience for me to get a glass of ice water instead of any other beverage. 

After that point when we weren't ready to order our server basically went MIA. Same with getting the bill it took forever. I would totally understand if the place was completely booked up but it was moderately busy with a few empty tables and some turn over while we were there.

As for the food, we got pepperoni and margherita pizza. Super simple pizzas not so super tasting. Their crust is tasteless and the sauce is sweet and completely lacking in complexity. The only redeeming thing  was the abundant cheese. I would go so far as to say these pizzas were gross. 

More on that: how does pizza arrive basically lukewarm and bordering on stale / wondering about timing that two simple pizzas were delivered at least 5 minutes apart. Just seems like a kitchen issue... Would have sent the cold pizza back but my dining companion had already started eating and servers were hard to flag down in this not so massive space. 

The Caesar salad was basically the only thing that saved the meal. It's incredible."}
{"text":"Super salty pepperoni (Soprasetta) pizza with honey (YUCK)! Super shitty service. Seriously, hipsters are ruining everything! They need to go back to school and learn some good ol' fashioned manners."}
{"text":"Super disappointing!!! First on their board outside it says whole pie!!! Staff describe their pizza \" super thin\" !!!!

The service is bad. Server was either busy flirting with a table of four ladies or polishing glassware, Also when he was talking i was not sure if he is talking to me or someone else.

Drinks are expensive in general. This part is my preference but I did not like their drink list.

I was hoping the pizza would be nice and tasty but a mushroom pizza that doesn't taste any mushroom in it :(

In a neighbourhood that you have libretto in front of you with this kind of service you will not last long. 

I would never come back neither recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Super Point Hack: How to Enjoy a Non-Libretto-or-Get-Well Pizza and Beer on Ossington:

1) Food: Wow, what a refreshing selection on the Ossington strip! Appetizers (warm olives, rice balls, shrimp and pork spring rolls, tomato bruschetta, grilled bread, beef carpaccio, burrata and peach, stracciatella, garlic and shrimp, king crab salad) range from $4-20. Soups and salads (soup of the day, caesar salad, tomato salad, grilled radicchio, beets on beets) go for $8-12. Pastas (lamb vavatelli, beef reginette) are about $15-16. Mains (quail saltimbocca, chicken parm, cheese burger, whole trout, 20-ounce ribeye) range from $12-85. Pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, peppers and gorgonzola, capicollo and olives, nduja deluxe) are about $12-17. Sides include the cheesy garlic bread for $7 - we tried this and it's sinfully delicious!

2) Drinks: sparkling, red, white, amber, and rose wines (too many to list!). Cocktails range fron $12-16. Beers (Woodhouse Lager, Asahi Dry, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Bench Sessions Ale, Rochefort Trappist, Beau's Lugtread, Sawdust City Lone Pine IPA, Bench Mosaic Dry Hop, Left Field Coffee Porter) are $6-12 but most are $9. Soft drinks include cola, fanta, grape, strawberry, pineapple, all $6 each. Caffeinated drinks include expresso, americano, cappucino, latte and teas, from $4 to $5.

3) Space: the space holds about 40 hipsters (but there's a takeout window too) with about 10-15 tables and 10 seats at the bar. The pizza oven, where you can watch the pizza makers do their magic, is at the front of the bar while the washrooms, graffitied in cool pizza-themed designs, are in the back, also near the main kitchen. Show up early because there can be a line to get it - not as long as Bang Bang, but it does get busy.

From the creators of Bar Fancy (Chef Jonathan Poon), Super Point is a super cool snack bar perfect for an ice-cold beer and a pizza pie. It's at 184 Ossington, which is right next to Rashers. Look for the neon electric SUPER POINT sign and the takeout window. Its vibe is more upscale than Get Well but less formal than Libretto. Perfect for 2 or a large group of friends, Super Point is easily a classic hotspot for beer, pizza, and good-times along Ossington. Check out the coasters, they're wicked!"}
{"text":"Pizza is fine, nothing to write home about.

Service is awful. Both in person and over the phone. Waitstaff is inattentive and could be more \"over\" being there. I've tried to order over the phone and have been in person and have met the same shit attitude both times.

When I called to place an order I was told to check the website (even though the menu on the website says ask your server for our available pizzas and they are not listed for this location). When I told him they weren't listen the guy on the phone said \"I'm sure you can figure it out, I don't really have time for this\". My apologies for trying to give you my money, don't worry it will never happen again.

I know you are in the ossington strip but that dosent give you the right to treat your customers like assholes for trying to get you to do your job. You are a business, act like one."}
{"text":"4+ stars for the service, wine list, caesar salad and spring rolls.

3-3.5 stars for the pizza -- it's a solid representation of an NYC pie but I thought the crust was on the bland and dry/brittle side. Also, it could use a bit more sauce and cheese, but that's just my opinion.

I'd come back, for sure, to try the pastas and other dishes, or even just for a caesar salad and couple glasses of funky natural wine."}
{"text":"The staff is a little surly, but I take that in stride. Seinfeldian New York has a Soup Nazi, so why not a Super Point Snark in the Six, right? Sure.

My point (a-hem) is this: the pizza is great. 

Disclaimer: I've only ever eaten here courtesy of take-out (slices, depending on availability, in addition to full pies) so cannot comment on the low-lit nooks of the restaurant space itself, the full food menu, or the quality of the cocktails. 

The pizza comes in two sizes - regular and large - and there's a decent selection of options. That said, there are two stand-outs for me: pepperoni (OG style) and mushroom. The mushroom has a creamy base and is covered with chunky fungi. I'm not usually a veggie pizza person (VPP) but this pie is perfect, even if the description in my preceding sentence is not. Not convinced? Consider the sesame-rimmed crust and perfect balance of thin-but-chewy base. Hungry yet? No? THEN YOU MUST BE A ROBOTIC AUTOMATON.

It's Super (point). 

Yelp note: remember to grab your paper plates and cutlery (if you're that kind of pizza eater; no judgment) if you're getting it to-go...it'll make all your picnic buds in Bellwoods mighty jelly."}
{"text":"\"It's like a tropical shipping container pizza party.\" 

Yes, this was a phrase that came out of my mouth on Friday night at Super Point. So let me break this statement down for you: 

+ Shipping container: Our group of four was sat in the back room (some refer to this as the \"Secret Bar\"), which seems to be a space legitimately formed out of a shipping container, or at least parts of it. Corrugated steel and the like. It also looks like the back wall is actually a garage door. Is this a sign this space will be a patio with that garage door open in the summer? I certainly hope so. Ossington needs more patios. 
+ Tropical: there are a bunch of hanging plants at the bar back here. Hostas it looks like. Maybe not exactly tropical, but the tropical feel is enhanced by the red light (partially reflected off the vintage Pizza Hut sign A++) and light, raw wood accents in the space. 
+ Pizza: doy. This place serves, amongst other things, delicious pizza. We shared the cheese pizza, and the red pepper and gorgonzola pizza. Both were tasty (zingy sauce, flavourfull cheese, excellent crust) and complimented well by the bitter crispness of our vinegary-dressinged radicchio and escarole salad. 
+ Party: good vibe, nice drinks list. Lots of options whether you want beer, wine, or a cocktail. The bar manager seems very knowledgable and has made sure to cover a wide range of varieties on all fronts. 

Happy face emoji, pizza emoji, thumbs up emoji."}
{"text":"3.5
If Michel Serra and Ellen Page had a pizza baby it would be \"SuperPoint\". The place is so hip I thought I needed a Tumblr to get a table. The menu is pretty interesting, they offer a lot of Italian classic you would not expect. The pizza was B+. The service is in the same lane as an Urban Outfitters."}
{"text":"I went to Superpoint last night, which was my second time being there.  We were a group of 12 and we did the pizza party menu at $40pp, which was perfect - lots of food, and delicious food - olives, garlic knots, tomato burrata salad, caesar salad, followed by pizza!   The caesar salad is a must - hickory sticks are on top rather than croutons.  My only complaint is that the pizza's came out quite slowly though.  But everything was so delicious, so I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Super Point is on point. It gets all of the points. Apparently I like the word point.

Weird point jokes aside, if you like pizza by the slice, wine, nooks and cozy restaurants this place is your jam. I really loved their pepperoni slice and I'm a huge sucka for anywhere that let's you drink champagne in their entry way. 

I will update this review when I return for a sit down meal, which is sure to be very soon. 

Happy pizza partying!"}
