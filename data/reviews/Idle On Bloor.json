{"text":"I don't think I've had a more awkward experience at a restaurant before my last visit to idle. 

I had been to idle for drinks one or two times prior to this visit and had anticipated trying some stuff off the menu. When the owner (co-owner?) came to take our order I asked for the happy hour special for the day. The man looked at me peculiarly and told me they had no such special. I responded by saying I had seen it advertised on idle's website. He continued to act like he didn't know what I was talking about. It was painfully awkward and caught me off guard. What kind of owner (or staff member for that matter) doesn't honour specials advertised on their own website? Not knowing what to do being the first of a group to order I regrettably asked for a pint. Although we were all starving and intended to order food it was hard to look past the shady service. As a result we had our drinks as quick as humanly possible and left never to return again. 

In hindsight I probably should've pulled up idle's website to prove my case but knowing that I was dealing with the owner, the deception clearly felt intentional. This all being said my review is purely based on service, which ultimately hindered my ability to actually eat food at this restaurant. 

So weird."}
{"text":"Was just passing when we noticed this restaurant...they just recently opened for brunch. The menu looked interesting...Asian dishes, burgers, waffles, pancakes...everything looked so good on that it was hard to decide. So we ordered various dishes to share...well the next time will be harder because everything was delicious. They accommodated my food allergies...everything is prepared fresh. We had avocado cold rolls, phad Thai, the chicken sandwich and Vietnamese ice coffees. The service is friendly and excellent...the owner is really open to feedback...great ambience...free WIFI....a fantastic addition to the neighbourhood. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood  cafe. Friendly service and a warm environment.
The menu has an eclectic feel, with something to everyone's taste. GOOD  portions for a great price.
Food &bar specials ever day.
Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"This place can do better. It was empty when we arrived and still empty when we left. Clearly, there is a problem. We arrived at dusk. the bright overhead lights were still on, snow shovels piled against the wall. Terrible techno pop was blasting. It was as though the management forgot they were open for business. 
The food was awful. We ordered a quesadilla- it seems like it's different each time we order it. The difference is consistent. Consistently bad. Today was with over cooked broccoli, overdone cheese with some deep fried chips scattered on a plate. The last time, blobs of sour cream sneered across the quesadilla. It was sloppy with unappetizing presentation. The salsa is not fresh. Drowning in water- the life drawn out of the tomatoes from preservative. It's as though the current management doesn't take pride in something with so much potential. It's a great location. A nice space. 
Surely with attention paid to music ( curate)! lighting ( cut the overheads) and most importantly the food ( fire the cook) - the experience of being here would be improved. Right now the vibe is super depressing. I would have given this place one star-  the second star is for the nice lady that seems to run the joint. I hope that she and her team will do better."}
{"text":"So it starts as we enter the restaurant.  There seems to be 3 staff members doing their own thing and not paying any attention to us or any of the other patrons.  2 girls are behind the bar counter chatting away about hair styles... whilst a man wanders the restaurant seemingly aimlessly (maybe he's a delivery person?).  Eventually we seated ourselves. Minutes later one of the ladies comes over with menus and water in a bottle... although she looked super puzzled and quizzical like \"what are you doing here? Would you like to eat here?\" but without saying it or asking though.

So we sit down and look at the menu and I say \"alright! This looks great! Look at all the options!\"  And then I looked at the options and wasn't impressed.  It was such a mishmash fusion of many different things that nothing appealed. And then I go to order the spicy pad thai... and I ask for it to be as not spicy as possible and she goes well the noodles are already pre sauced so there's nothing we can do.  So I asked for another minute to decide on what I wanted and I decided on nothing so we left.

I liked the decor.  It was kitsch-ish and cute.  The music was awkward it was like 2006 fallout boy except it wasn't fallout boy and I didn't enjoy it. It just didn't match what was going on inside nor did it entice us to stay.

So.  I did not eat here, but I did experience feeling like we were ignored, did experience music that made me wanna leave, and had a look at the less than impressive menu.

My advice is walk next door to the Thai place or go across the street to Hogtown Vegan."}
{"text":"My wife and I really like it here. Pints of beer are $5. Tall cans $6.50 (great selection on both). Nothing on the menu is over $10. It's not award winning food, but it's still quite good & satisfying and definitely worth the price (my wife and I really enjoyed pad thai and cheddar burger) - menu is similar to places like Green Room, Red Room and Urban House cafe.

Service was great, attentive, friendly and welcoming. Ambiance is mellow, yet social - music is not too loud - 50's and 60 doowop playing. Lighting perfect - charming decor inside - rustic brick wall.

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really great prices for beer and a pretty nice quiet spot. The food is alright, but the service is great.

Good place to go to if you actually want to be able to chat while you drink (the other places in the area can be pretty noisy)"}
{"text":"Great place to spend a laid back evening in the neighbourhood. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, the food is consistently good, the service is always friendly, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Odd odd odd service. Looming just behind you while you sort out the bill. Under poured \"pints\" (16oz which turn into 14oz with chintzy pour). It was good but has declined in service. Just an overall bizarre experience. I'm sure it will improve as the server gains some service knowledge but it was so hard not to be turned off by it all."}
{"text":"Good news!    The original owners are fully removed  from the premise.  This is now fully owned and operated by a woman named Helen who is so lovely.  I am genuinely happy this occurred because it is such a cute place and some of there food is great

Here is why you should go;

1) amazing service.  Literally, they take care of you so well here you feel as though you are visiting friends

2) Their food is also good, specifically their Asian influenced dishes. 

3) Very affordable.  Easy to have drinks and food for two for $40ish 

I am glad Helen has taken over and I am looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I need to come back again soon. Great ambience and drinks, and had a great pad Thai. Jeff there is the best, he was a really helpful server and super personable. If you go here and get Jeff serving you, that guy deserves a big fat tip."}
