{"text":"I am very pleasantly surprised by this place.  I am Japanese Canadian and had the daily salmon sashimi special and it was a lot of food!  For $14.99 it is an AMAZING deal and the salmon was good.  About 7 thick pieces of sashimi and then California rolls and other rolls too.  I was quite full and some ice cream that was hard, I LOVE hard ice cream!  Soo excited to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Average sushi spot. Good for a post workout meal. $14.99 for eat in specials are good food for the money. About 20+ assorted pieces of sushi/sashimi, rice with your choice of meat or shrimp plus soup salad and dessert. Not bad at all. Small family owned. Service can sometimes be slow but friendly nonetheless. I don't think the owners/workers ever take a day off. As is I support small shops and this place is close to home, affordable and pretty good."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck, the quality is pretty good and can't complain about the price. Better than the other local sushi store around the area."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to get sushi in Eastern Toronto and Durham Region. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sushi. From the outside, the restaurant looks very run down and dirty. However, upon entering the place is surprisingly clean and very quaint. I can't remember the exact name of this but they offer an all day, dine-in only special for $15. It comes with a lot of sushi including miso soup, salad, and dessert as well as a lot of other options for substitutes. I like the fact that this place isn't all you can eat. Since I find they are often overpriced, under delivering, and all around not a good value. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The food is about as authentic as it gets. The restaurant could use an update on the outside and some decor changes on the inside, however with a menu so cheap for fresh sushi you can't really complain. For anyone who isn't familiar with Japanese restaurants or cuisine you may find yourself googling what's actually on the menu since it isn't accompanied with many pictures or descriptions. The only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 star is the outside and inside needing to be updated."}
{"text":"Dead fly found on piece of salmon that I took half a bite of. Just happened to eye the last half - no thanks, never going back again. Server said that their fish is fresh from fridge - yeah I doubt that.  Coincidentally commented that the walls were filthy and Ta-Da - surprise, extra protein on a piece of fish. Would give less than 1 star if possible."}
{"text":"I often go here to pick up some sushi. The price points are great and the sushi itself is pretty good. Now this isn't the best sushi I've had in Toronto however I can get a few rolls for around 15 dollars."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible - and now I'm sick! I eat Japanese food quite frequently, and this place is probably one of the worst places I've ever been to. I came here based on Google reviews, which were very positive - and I don't know why?! I ordered the maki set and got green tea and Miso soup with it. The green tea was cold and diluted way too much, and the Miso was bland and lacked flavour. When the maki came, I could already tell the tuna and salmon looked questionable - it was dry and lacked texture. I should have had the common sense to send it back, but I wanted to give it a shot - which was a huge regret as I woke up the next day sick. I don't understand how they got everything wrong. Like, how do you go wrong with tea?! In gist, I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they improve on the quality of their ingredients."}
{"text":"Polite and friendly service.  The restaurant's decor has seen better days and needs updating.  The bento box dinner tasted good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since 2001.  The quality and the taste is as consistent as when I first tried.  I am comforted with the freshness of the sashimi and the reliable crunch of the shrimp tempura.  Delicious, hearty and comforting, never fails each time I visit!"}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest, freshest Sushi, Sashimi in the greater Toronto area - at half the price of Downtown/North York/Yonge St shops.  Granted the decor is aging a bit and nothing's changed here in 15 years - but the food remains great and an incredible value! We keep returning every time we want our Sushi fix.  Order a large Hot Sake and share with friends and loved ones while gettin' your fix."}
{"text":"Ever since Niji got hit by a fire, I've been looking for a new go to place for a cheap but delicious sushi fix.   Despite their terrible parking lot, their food is pretty good. Not amazing, but it'll help scratch the itch. Their fish is okay, they have some nice all-day specials, etc. The main lure is honestly the price.   Don't go expecting anything to knock your socks off. My friend who ate with me didn't like their chirashi and I wouldn't recommend trying to order stuff like Uni. Stick to basics like salmon, california rolls, tempura, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I don't know why some people said it's bad.if u know What's real Japanese food. You will know that's great. I know a lot of Japanese people go there for years."}
{"text":"2.5 starts  Good bang for the buck but I would not go out of my way to return. Food is OK if your looking for cheap eats. It's a small place and I would guess its family owned. The place was about 50% full and food arrived quickly.  My wife an I each had a Bento box combo with various items. Would not rate high on the quality scale but quantity was good. Easy to miss when you drive by."}
{"text":"A small and old sushi restaurant but don't judge a book by its cover. It's a quiet environment but Im always coming to here for their Dine-in Special as the price can't be best for what you get. The sushi there is great to eat but you can't leave the resteraunt WITHOUT having their amazing giant Salmon Roses. The price is a bit steep for having 2 salmon roses but you will NOT regret spending for them :) Its not the most exquisite sushi restaurant around but for the price you pay and the service it's worth it for a good afternoon munch."}
{"text":"Good food especially for the price of each dish.  Love the sashimi here and they have great lunch specials.   Go to orders: Super red dragon roll Salmon sashimi Scallop sashimi Their all day specials  Age tofu is a must ($2.5 for 8 pieces!) Bento boxes - beef/chicken/salmon Shrimp tempura!  Spicy salmon roll"}
{"text":"Dine in specials are a great value. $14.99 for 23 pieces. I've been coming here for many years and always a good go to place for sushi.   The place looks old but it's simple and clean, staff is friendly and polite and it's never really that busy so good when you want to have dinner by yourself or a place for a quiet chat with an old friend.  Ambiance is not that great, I go there because the sushi is fresh, yummy, fast, and cheap. Dine in special goes on all day."}
{"text":"Just want to start off that I've been here a couple of times and the service and food was decent which is why I'm surprised and confused when the service I received over the phone was horrendous and disrespectful.  I had some family over one night and they decided they wanted Sushi. One place that came to mind was this place since it's local, the price is decent and the Sashimi is pretty good quality. First off, they did not have Uni (Uni is sea urchin, very expensive, but worth it) which my family was really looking forward to, but what can you do. I then ordered a Sashimi + Sushi combo, beef teriyaki bento deluxe, some rolls and to top it off, eel with rice. The total was about $80 which I was fine with.  The driver arrived at our house about 40 mins after our order which is pretty good so I tipped him $10. When the food arrived we were all very excited. The sashimi combo and the rolls were great as usual. But when we opened the beef teriyaki and the eel with rice, we were not happy. The eel with rice came with 3 pieces of eel, each piece was about an inch wide maybe a little bigger and to compensate the small portion they loaded the box with white rice, which was a big mistake cause it made the portion look even smaller. Same thing goes for the beef teriyaki, portion was small and it did not look very appetizing. It looked like he took some raw meat used in Pho and fried it up.   I called them right away and the same girl who took my order answered. I explained to her the issue and either she didn't understand or just didn't care. I was not expecting a free meal or anything in return, but for them to just explain why the portion is so small for $8.50. I literally ate the eel in 3 bites...Not only did she not try to help, she laughed at me at one point when I was clearly unhappy so I hung up. One thing i can't stand is disrespect, no matter how good the place is, customer service is everything. My gf works at a high end sushi restaurant and if she ever laughed at a customer she'd get fired in a matter of seconds.  I will never come back to this place again, you can find better prices around that area for about the same quality. If anything, go to the AYCE sushi restaurants around there, they're actually pretty decent or pay a little more and get A+ sushi with A+ customer service. Go to Sushi Moto. ;)"}
{"text":"Came here multiple times for different occasions and they never cease to fail me. My family and I come her often so they're starting to remember us by name and make small talk. The bento is awesome, why? Comes with a small salad, soup, 3 Cali rolls, rice, teriyaki meat (chicken, beef or salmon) under a bed of teriyaki vegetables, tempura, dumplings and, of course, ice cream. All day special is usually something if your itchin for just sushi for a fair price. Hot and flavorful tempura sauce, great service; fast in food, orders, refills, and clearing the table."}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi joint in Scarborough. Located in a strip mall so there's plenty of parking, the décor isn't much to talk of, but the food sure is! The kids each have their favourites, and I like the overall quality and flavor of the food. My favourites are the Sweet Hearts - crab salad stuffed into bean curd boats, and the avocado salad - the same crab mix, but this time with chunks of avocado served in the avocado shell. I'm picky and demanding when it comes to sushi so I almost always order a la carte. That can hit the wallet a little harder, but hey, I'm worth it. There isn't a huge selection of custom rolls, mainly the mainstays or simpler flavours, which isn't bad if you like what you like. Quality is consistently very good, service is relatively fast, though this can vary depending on who's on staff and how busy they are. The last time I was there the place looked mostly empty, but they were processing a continuous stream of pick up and take out orders the whole time, so if popularity with the locals is your gauge, then these guys are right up there. I've been going here for ten years now, and I can confidently recommend this place."}
{"text":"When I get asked how is Super sushi house?  It brings a smile to my face.  This establishment is so polite and convenient and offers a great dinner menu.  One of my favourite rolls in this place is the super red dragon roll.  Fried shrimp tempura in the middle with avocado and more, yum! But honestly, I would highly recommend this place to people.  The prices are reasonable on the dinner combos they offer you.  The lunch menu is packed with a lot of items and priced really well.  There really is no down side to this restaurant.  When you dine in, wait times are not bad, they bring you nice tea, and the food is fresh.  Last time I went i ordered a Ramen, and they made it with a few substitutions to accomodate me.  That is a real plus.  If your in the scarborough area, check this place out, its a bit small but its worth it!    8/10  Follow me on twitter:  @Slidewaysclutch"}
{"text":"Tried their combo specials. Good lil place in a quiet area.....nothing too fancy. Very affordable sushi."}
{"text":"My favorite place ..i found it by accident and year later still going back for more. Small...not fancy..homey feeling. Fresh yummy & good $."}
{"text":"This is my second visit in 2 weeks.  I just love the All Day Specials.  My favourite because I  get so much food for $14.99.  What a steal?  All Day Special #1: I get Miso soup, salad, 10 pcs. of Salmon Sashimi, 7 pcs. of Sushi and 1 x 6 pcs. of California roll and this time I ordered Chicken Teriyaki.  Fresh and tasty.    I am suprised there is not a line up for all that food.  This could be my go to place for a quick fix Sushi place.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"i came to toronto to visit my family and stayed with them for the whole week of my vacation. they took me to this little japanese restaurant for a dinner out.  i ordered a daily special of sushi, sashimi and shrimp and vegetable tempura..they were a bit slow since they only had one person serving the whole restaurant and i guess one person doing all the cooking/preparing of the sushi/sashimi. the food tasted very fresh and appetizing. the red bean ice cream was pleasantly very tasteful.   we were a group of 14 and only paid a bill of $220. i mean, im from new york and that is such a great bargain for good food!! though it wasnt the best japanese restaurant ive ever been to but it certainly was a good one for the price.   might be back if ever i get a chance :)"}
{"text":"Super sushi house.... Where to start.   I should've known from the lack of customers and badly hand made Bristol board signs with grammar errors, I shouldn't be expecting much but we were hungry and this place was the closest to my friends place.   After walking in. Server let us sit wherever we liked, we choose middle area seating. Came by with the menu that had lots of pencil/pen price changes and large sized cups of tea, yay! but had no flavour, boo!  Looking over the menu, good amount of choices to pick from. Took the server forever to come by to take our order, I would say good 15mins. We got the calamari for appetizer and 3 sets of rolls, mushroom, spider and dynamite. I uploaded a photo of the sushi :) Mushroom was rubbery, dynamite was good and spider tasted okay. The calamari was worth it tho, 4 bucks for the amount that we got too. Overall bill was $20. I honestly will probably not be coming here ever again.."}
{"text":"Due to lack of sushi places in Scarborough that deliver, we decided to order from here for lunch. No lunch special meals on their menu, so when we got our food we didn't get any miso soups/salad only our main food. Our super red dragon roll was anything but super. It was so tiny and disappointing. They really need to work on their food offerings to jack up their rolls a bit. We were still hungry after and it cost like $20 a person for such a small portion of food. No thank you, won't be coming back. Not to mention it took more than an hour to get the food. If you do order know that you need to order ahead of time and it won't be cheap either."}
{"text":"If the cravings hit...  I had their age tofu the other day. It's on sale right now. $2.50? 8 pieces. Fairly crispy. Great for price.  I also had their katsudon ($7.50). IT was alright. The katsu was soggy because of the egg. The egg was overcooked. It was also fairly one dimensional in flavor. That one could have been much better.   Their sashimi and California rolls were alright, but not outstanding, but for the price, it's fairly decent.  My biggest complaint would be that there were quite a few flies going around. Swatting while eating meals is no fun."}
{"text":"The food here is great, particularly the sashimi which is tender and fresh.  The all-day menu special is a great deal (see Destiny's review below) - very filling for a good price, and good quality sushi.  The waitress was very friendly and we didn't have to wait long for anything.  A lot of people have commented on the bad service below, but maybe it's changed since those visits, because I had absolutely no complaints.  On the contrary, I thought the service quite good.  It looks like a cheap family-run place, but that's its charm.  I love the Japanese bits and bobs they've used to decorate, including a blowfish hanging from a paper lantern."}
{"text":"Came here around 3:30ish and it rather empty, most people were getting takeout but my sister and I decided to dine in. We skimmed through the menu and decided we were gonna get their all day specials instead. The all day specials was on a separate small menu placed on the table. I ordered the #4 and my sister got the #2. Food came out very quick and piping hot which was good. The waitress was very attentive, occasionally checking on us every 20-25 minutes to see if we need anything else.  Moving onto the food, my #4 included: 5 pcs of sashimi, 5 pcs of futomaki, 6 pcs of tuna roll, 2 pcs of tuna sushi and salmon sushi. All of them were very delicious and tasted very fresh especially the sashimi (it didn't taste like it was taken out of the freezer and flashed thaw). My sister's #2 included: 7 pcs of assorted sushi, 1 tuna hand roll, 6 pcs of Cali roll and 5 pcs of salmon sashimi. In the assorted sushi, there was white tuna sushi which she didn't like stating it tasted like wet paper LOL but I was quite okay with it (I swear it's acquired taste).   Overall, the restaurant was great. I would definitely come back when I'm craving sushi. Honestly, I couldn't believe sometimes how far I would go to get sushi when I had such an awesome sushi place 5 mins by bus away."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a couple of buds since we couldn't get in at another sushi place nearby.  Overall this place is pretty average 3.5/5.   They have a $14.99 combo where you can select teriyaki chicken, beef tempura shirmp or salmon teriyaki  and get an additional choice of your sashimi/sushi.   The price for all that and the value that you get is very decent. After tax it's almost $17 but you get a decent amount of food! This is a good steal if your just looking for just average sushi combo's with other sides. There's nothing eye popping about the dish but if your craving for inexpensive sushi and want to be satisfied this place does the trick.  The interior is looking very old... the floor tiles appear to be dated with really old grungy ceramic tile.. Their daily special promo's and there signs up could use some fixing since they write their own promotions on bristol board.... Also the lighting is pretty bad.. It's very dim and sometimes I felt like sleeping because it's not bright enough inside the place..   I feel like the place needs to do some renovations to get up there business again. I feel like they have a lot of regulars that still go but they need to do something to their interior to attract more new customers. The service was OK. The servers are nice but they are kind of slow... I think I had waited about 30-40 minutes to get my food..   The place isn't bad for the value of food that you get. This place isn't top notch sushi don't get your hopes up but it definitely is a place for cheap and satisfying portions if that's what your craving."}
{"text":"It's definitely cheap! If you don't have a lot of money to spend on good quality sushi then definitely check this place out!   It's not terrible but it could be better. The people that take your order are a little bit rude they don't like to answer simple questions you have about the sushi(example: does it taste good, what does certain ingredients mean and other common questions that people who don't normally eat sushi would ask)   I only really come to the sushi place because it's close to my house but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I've actually been coming here for a few years, but these experiences started off way before I had a smartphone, and way before I had even heard of Yelp. As I've stated in my other reviews, I'm a big fan of value-for-money, as well as taste in food, and dang, does this place deliver on both.  The bento box selection is amazing, and for such a reasonable price (Lunch is around $9, dinner deluxe bentos are around $13). Lunch gives you a choice of meat, shrimp/veg. tempura, rice&fruit, dinner adds a dumpling, soup, salad, ice cream and 3pc california roll. They also have $15 all-day specials that have a dessert, soup, salad, choice of meat OR shrimp/veg. tempura, and a bunch of awesome sushi/sashimi choices.   They also have an all-day a la carte menu - I remember I used to order Agedashi Tofu every visit; four pieces with those leaves that look like they dance for only $2.99!  What else can I possible gush about. The quality of food is great, but not \"perfect\" (obviously, it's a value place!). The best part for sure is that I always feel full, and I always enjoy my eating experience here. I've never had a bad cut of sushi when I did order the daily specials, and I was always greeted and served quickly and in a very friendly manner, even when the establishment was busy.  The only reason I don't give this place a five star rating is because I wish they would offer more variety of sushi in their sushi combos. I know other places very close by (cough Ni Ji) have amazing selection and variety for a good price, if Super Sushi House had that, I know my family and I would be coming here every time!  Also, the second reason for a one-off star comes from comments from my family around our gatherings that have taken place here regarding the cleanliness. While I personally haven't had issues with cleanliness here, the appearance is certainly an issue when you compare this establishment to other places in similar price ranges (again, Ni Ji).  That being said, I'll be a life-long fan. I'm a loyal customer to family-owned establishments, and I know for a fact these guys will still be kicking around in the same fashion ten years from now, so you can count on me coming back.   TL;DR: Highly recommended for a foodie fan who likes being full, and doesn't worry too much about \"authentic Japanese experience\" (it's owned by Chinese people, c'mon guys, be reasonable). Come here if you like quantity & variety value for your money. and never be afraid to try something new! (cough try the a la carte menu)"}
{"text":"the interior is nothing to be crazy about but the food is great for the cheap price. I cant complain!!"}
{"text":"I'd only been here once two years ago, in January 2008, when I used to go to the Goodlife gym just north of this Japanese restaurant. A tiny restaurant that is family-owned, has very quick service and an extremely staff. While I thought the food was good, not outstanding, my mom got some salad that was a bit stale."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what happened to this place. The sushi is still great however services has totally gone in the shit can.  The brother is the one who always makes the sushi but the waiting staff has changed.  The last 3 times I've come here - my sushi takes FOREVER to come - last time I waited 45 min to get my meal, and then to top it off they are always forgetting parts of my order. One time it was the sushi pizza and then the other time it was my California rolls.  I could understand if they said oh sorry we forgot but they don't even realize because it's still on my bill when it comes time to pay.  I don't have the patience for this place anymore.  Sorry guys :("}
{"text":"I've been here twice in one week.  From the look at the exterior, i was hesitant to try this place. The interior is pretty much the same, both need redo/reno.  Besides that, the food is good... not great, but good!! Not bad, but good!  As mentioned in other reviews, this is a place for affordable sushi.  You really get your moneys worth here.  So, i can live with them not doing any redo/reno to keep their prices good.  It does get busy around 6-7pm.  People coming in to take out also.  The young waitress is the only one there covering the floor, so sometimes you do have to wait for her.  But you just have to ask her once, and she gets it done as soon as she can.  So, expect affordable sushi, and good friendly service."}
{"text":"Convenient and low key Japanese sushi place:) The aura and interior of the restaurant make you feel cozy and as if a relative of yours is cooking your food. Great place to catch up with your friends or family. Food preparation time is different from time to time:) overall, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Did the dinner for two $30. Pretty good! Comes with Miso soup, seaweed salad, California rolls, sashimi, ice cream, udon -- pretty much all the works.   Would totally go here as it was good and cheap for sushi!   Great service :))"}
{"text":"My wife and I normally go to another sushi place in the area, but it was Sunday so that place was closed. Google redirected us to Super Sushi. I ordered the beef bento box and my wife ordered the vegetable bento box. Things started good, the miso soup was very good, but that's where things ended.  When the bento boxes arrived there wasn't too much desirable about our meals. The main star of my beef bento box should have been the beef, but it was covered in a gelatinous teriyaki sauce which was a liquid in some places and a harder gel in others. I removed the hardened gel and continued eating. Additionally, there was an excessive usage of a lot of cheap filler ingredients such as bean sprouts and rice. Other places usually give steamed vegetables such as broccoli, carrots and mushrooms with some sprouts...not JUST sprouts in sauce.  In regards to service,  it wasn't there as well. We're not too sure why, since we were the only people in the place at the time.  When we first arrived, we were warmly greeted and the server was quick to take our order but at no point did she ask how our meal was and when we requested a top up of our tea she never returned to the table - not even to give us the bill. We had to wait several minutes at the front counter for her to finally ring us up."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening. Haven't been here for over 7 years. Small place but convenient location and ample parking. Ordered bento boxes of eel and salmon. Both came with soup,salad, california roll and ice cream. Also ordered spicy salmon skin roll. Overall great food and service. The servers are friendly. And we were very full. Will return to this hidden Scarborough joint."}
{"text":"I think this is very good place to get your Japanese grub on. It is a rather small place with its flaws. The tables feel rather close to each other and the place feels outdated. The food on the other hand is rather good. I personally only order from the all-day special which contains a Japanese salad, miso soup, teriyaki or tempura and a complete plate of either sushi, hand rolls or maki. It is generously priced at $17 w/ tax. The customer service is great and although there English is below standards, just ask and they will try their best to help you.  Overall I would say the food, customer service and the pricing as a pro while the environment is a con in my mind."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars for its cheap prices. Not the worst sushi but not the best either. Got the All Day Special #4 with the beef teriyaki. The sashimi was my favourite of the set. The beef teriyaki tasted more like soy sauce than teriyaki. The special also comes with the basic salad and miso soup. Dessert is a scoop of ice cream, the green tea ice cream was of decent quality.  Not sure how recently they raised the prices but the All Day Special is now $16.99 (up from $15.99). Regardless it's still a great price for how much food you're getting."}
{"text":"If you looking for cheap and affordable Japanese food, Super Sushi House would be a good place to go.  Lunch Specials from 11 to 3 starting from $4.25, though the portion is on the smaller side, but one cannot expect too much at this price point!  Sushi Lunch ($4.99) at least have a tuna roll, salmon sushi and tuna sushi. I am still hungry after that... maybe I should just order the regular assortment of sushi instead.  All Day Specials ($14.99) should be a good deal since it has sushi/sashimi/rolls and even a choice of teriyaki.  Super Sushi House is a good place if you want plenty of food at a reasonable price, but not if you really want to have \"authentic\" Japanese food."}
{"text":"*****BEWARE!! This place is AWFUL!  My boyfriend and I had sushi delivered from here and the calamari was burnt rubber. The sushi was sub-par, and the rolls were probably some of the worst I've tried in my entire life of eating sushi.  This is where it gets messed up- We finished unsatisfied...and then my throat began to get numb. It led to my gums swelling, and my left cheek having an overwhelming numbness too. I AM NOT ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING!!! Also, I order the exact same rolls from every place I go to. I have never had anything like this happen to me. I am now contemplating sushi delivery from anywhere"}
