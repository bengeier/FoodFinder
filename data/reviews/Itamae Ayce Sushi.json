{"text":"Came here for lunch only but they had a very decent selection and was quite consistent with their quality as well. Definitely my go to ayce lunch if I'm around the area. Service is usually better than the average ayce"}
{"text":"Nothing here is good..... other than they have sweet shrimp, but other than that I don't really like any of the other stuff.  Especially they are so close to Mikado, a very authentic Jap rest in the area, although is more expensive, but can't compare at all"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on here I thought this place might not be so great but I took 4 coworkers to try it out with me yesterday.

I have to say, yes the menu is a little small for lunch but it has all the sushi and rolls you could ask for. We enjoyed ordering on the ipads. 

Service; it took a long time for them to clean the table so we could sit and it took another 5 minutes after that to get the Ipad to place our order. For a place just starting out, not to shabby but don't expect a quick in and out experience if you need a fast lunch. 

Lunch is 13.99 and for the grand opening had a 20% off special so very good value for money.

Food; limited selection of sushi (salmon, red snapper, egg, crab stick & white tuna)
For the maki (rolls) they have a great selection and all the 'favorites' like eel and avocado, or dragon roll plus some interesting house specials. It was quick to get food after ordering, very quick indeed. 

I'd recommend this place for lunch! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent ambience and worst service! Extremely rude asian waitresses including the Manager. They add 10% tip to your bill and inform you when you're paying that they've already added it and the manager went on to say that all Japanese restaurants add 10%....such B.S"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my friends yesterday with 20% off coupon.
I don't know why others gave them poor rating, I think this restaurant is great.
The I-pad menu is easy to use.
Yes, the items on menu are not so many, but the food is tasty, and they have some special rolls.
for the sashimi, they even have sweet shrimp, this is my favorite~
Service is good, waiters are very helpful and smile all the time.
And I also heard a customer talked to the waitress about how happy they could have this restaurant around.
Actually, I don't think I should give it Five Stars, but I really think this poor rating is unfair to them.
I would give them 4.5~ ^_^"}
{"text":"I came here to have lunch with a friend.The price is right. I love the sashimi... Highly recommended for those who love Japanese Sushi's"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim saw it when I was driving past previously. I was impressed with the atmosphere of the restaurant. We sat down got our drinks and ordered our food. The rice was quite bland which was a big disappointment to me and we also had to call a waiter twice to get our drinks refilled. It wasn't enough to ask if the refills are free as a hint that we need refills. I did think the unique types of rolls they had were cool such as the strawberry roll. Don't think I'd go back"}
{"text":"It is an all you can eat sushi restaurant. Normally I don't like this kind of restaurant but I tried it and was surprised by the qualify for the money.
The ordering is by iPad which is a very efficient way to order.
Highly recommended for lunch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and  experienced what others already said, sub par food, corners cut, orders never arriving. Sashimi is available on the weekend but the fish was like finger nail sized pieces  and not fresh."}
{"text":"The iPad menus are neat, but they seem to let the wait staff off the hook for actually providing service. We had to keep asking if things we'd ordered were going to come, and the touchscreen menu added to the confusion. The green stuff wasn't like real wasabe; almost tasteless and gradually disappeared in the soya sauce. The salmon pizza and fried banana were good; but my overall experience was negative."}
{"text":"We used 3 coupons from Groupon for our 3 visits. First time about 3 months ago was the best and each subsequent time it was getting worst in services and food as well. Good thing we only paid 48+taxes+tip (decreased from 12 to 10 to 7%) as services were really getting bad. For example: wrong quantity brought out. After bringing it to their attention we would have to ask different server about 4 times each issue. Seaweed salad decreased substantially, it became more salad than seaweed. Only chicken skewer were good but if you count they are short changing the order for example you order 2 unit that would equal to 8 pieces but they only give you 5 skewers. That happen for practically every large quantity order. We were planning to come back just for buffet but not now. We saw some great review for another sushi buffet near Pacific Mall and tried the Bentonville box today and found their food is much more fresh and carefully made. This is still a decent place for after Ontario Science center visit to end the day with if you are from out of town."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place ever since it opened, before the new owner arrived the menu and service was excellent however when new owner took over he changed the menu but not for the best. My mother ordered the shrimp tempura and crab tempura, it has been 30 minutes since she has ordered and still no food. Also it seems that if you order 50 pieces of sashimi they will only give you 18 and tell you the rest will come when you're done eating the sashimi however the other 32 pieces never arrived. I have been coming to this place every month for the past 3 or 4 years but I won't come back after today."}
{"text":"Good meal for the price. 
Nigiri sushi was delicious, but maki was not good. Sushi rice for nigiri was very nice. But maki was mushy. I am Japanese, so I know about Sushi well.
The room was cold, I needed to wear the jacket while I was eating.
It is nice place to bring family.
Thank you"}
{"text":"The dish well prepared and taste really good. I was disappointed that the servers are not very friendly as they dont really talk and i think this is very important and has an impact of attracting more customers. But food wise i am satisfied and so cool to order from the ipad but kind of misleading though as it doesn't really look like what they show on the ipad. Will certainly go again as am a great fan of sushi :)"}
{"text":"It seems like lately, we are trying to check out every ayce sushi joint in town. I don't expect much from AYCE, and really I want to give this place a 2.5 but I can't. The decor of the restaurant is pretty nice for an ayce but service is alright (as most places) and the food is meh! Mediocre and nothing special."}
{"text":"When doing AYCE, the portion sizes can be confusing. One dish can come with 6 pieces, another with only 1, so you have to really think/read about the portions to get a right amount.

The quality is top--notch fresh, well-prepared, and artistically arranged on the plate like a proper sushi plate should be. The sauces are flavourful and you get plenty for your orders. The staff are pleasant though not all over you constantly checking, but then I don't like to be interrupted every third bite. However, there's always someone around to help if you ask.

The interior is trendy and clean with a very upscale feel to it. The seating is comfortable and roomy.

In all honesty, I don't understand the poor ratings. This may not be Yorkville but it's great all the same."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch woth a couple of my friends. We did the AYCE.

The sushi is pretty good, not too much rice as filler.  Service is quite fast, though I wish the servers were more friendlier. My particular favourite was the Dynamite Roll.  Wasn't a fan of the sushi pizza.

Parking is available and it's easily accessible by public transit."}
{"text":"The food is really good and fresh. You can tell that everything is cooked to order. You order your food using an iPad as the menu which gives a visual of everything on the menu. They have various types of sushi and great chinese food."}
{"text":"We came for lunch AYCE and it was very good. Not the most vast selection compared to others in the area (Maki Sushi) but still decent. Seaweed salad was great, beef skewers had a yummy sauce.  The yam tempura and the fried udon was a little too oily. Disclaimer, I don't eat sushi , only the cooked stuff, but my wife says the sushi was good. Dessert included cheesecake, mango mousse and the good quality red bean ice cream brand. 

You order everything via a tablet and everything had pictures."}
{"text":"This place is really bad never ever go here the 
I went here on a Saturday for lunch and the first thing I noticed it that all ingredients are old and the seaweed that wrapped the sushi was aired out and lacked the crunchiness, my seafood fried rice was served in the smallest portion I've ever seen, also it had some sorta fish but it had a really bad after taste. All the crabmeat in my maki felt like rubber.
The menu in overall was smaller than most places and lacked choice including the drink menu they only had 2 kinds for beer. My bbq ells sushi has no rice at the bottom. The atmosphere is mediocre and not pleasing. My seating was uncomfortable they didn't want me sit where I want just for ease of cleaning up."}
{"text":"Love the menu at this place. Sashimi is so fresh. Love that they have Red Tuna at no additional charge. Raw beef and salmon salad are also delicious. Service is very good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing all you can eat sushi restaurant worth every dollar especially for their lunch menu which is only $14 I believe before taxes. Great variety, great tasting sushis and amazing customer service. Last time my friends and I went in for the lunch all you can eat and we ended up leaving late. The waitress charged us for the dinner menu by accident and actually came out looking for us to give us our money back. That made me become an even more loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I read all the bad reviews, and still decided to come check out this restaurant. Specially since it's so close to my house. I have to say. It's really really good. And you don't pay as much as the other all you can eat restaurants. My mom liked it so much and the place is so slick. I would totally recommend it and continue eating here.

UPDATE: Came back again, during the weekdays... And this place is packed! Holy, specially since they have amazing deals during the weekdays . I did find a fruit fly in the soy sauce... But I find this to be usual in sushi restaurants... Specially the ones that served lots of fruit dishes."}
{"text":"I visited this place Victoria Day weekend after the lunch time hour. According to my experience, the staff appeared clueless, as they were not on top of their customers' needs and delivered slowly. A server had plated food on top of one another, which had slid off their plates and cross contaminated other food. Mine was given to me late, therefore cold and not to mention tasteless. On top of this, they had accidentally overcharged my order. I will definitely NOT come here again. Most importantly, sushi is supposed to be fresh!"}
{"text":"Worst sashimi ever!  This restaurant caters to those who are impressed by big portions and who care nothing for quality.  You will pay a fortune for stale and flavourless \"fish\" - even if using a groupon.  If you want flavour, go for a roll.  At least then the chef can disguise their so called \"fish\" with some mystery sauce.  Better yet, spend your hard earned cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"I live in the area, so I've been to Itamae several times. I really like it. I'm not a sushi connoisseur at all, but I like pretty much all the food I've eaten here. I'd say 3.5 stars, nothing really blows me away, but it's tasty food, served in a reasonable amount of time, in a pleasant manner.

Will go back.
Would recommend if you live in or are visiting the area and want ayce sushi."}
{"text":"I always like to go to this place, for a vegetarian there's always something great to order. I like the iPad ordering system and the staff is very helpful."}
{"text":"Wife & I visited when it first opened in 2013 and weren't too impressed, but the iPads were unique and drew us in.

Months later we came back and were AMAZED at the improvements on everything!
Quality Food
Quality service
Quality presentation
And I still love the iPads!

Food is delicious and I am very impressed at no matter the size of the order, 3 salmon sashimi or 30 salmon sashimi, they put in extra effort to make it presentable. 
After ordering, food comes in LESS than 3 Minutes on average. 

They've really perfected the system and always bring friends and family.

Today is my cousin's last day in Canada and he says it's the best japanese food he's had!

Well done Itamae!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has so many negative reviews, but I loved Itamae! Its location (and menu) is probably the only thing that I don't like, but other than that, I had a great experience at Itamae!

Alright, now as much as I love technology and the way it's evolved the world, I REALLY HATE the iPad menus! I end up missing certain things on the menu because I didn't scroll. I end up ordering too much or too little of what I want. It just causes a mess. I'm a paper-and-pencil kinda gal.

Anyways, onto the good stuff! There were sooo many choices on the menu at Itamae that I found it hard to choose what I wanted. This place is probably good for really large groups just so that you can order one of everything that you want and everyone can split the pot (I can eat a lot but I definitely cannot eat 4 rolls by myself). The dessert choices are vast and really good as well.

The service was super quick and super good. The waitresses were always filling up our glasses with water and they were always there to help us if anything was wrong with the iPad menu. Although it was a little busy that day, our sushi was still delivered in record time! Ahhhmazing!

Decor in this place is nice. The booths are very comfy and the place is just really clean and visually appealing. 

The price is a bit steep, but IMO, its worth it (I paid a little over $25 with tip and tax for a weekday dinner sesh). Give them a try!"}
{"text":"We were there for the grand opening, but our experience was a little different than some of the others who reviewed it.

Basically, the food was reasonably solid, the service was sub-par, and the overall experience was slow and chaotic. I'm willing to accept that there were some opening jitters, but I probably won't try it again for a few months to get a better sense of how it feels after they've worked out the kinks.

When we arrived, we were seated quickly, but then waited ten minutes for menus. The iPad-based menu system is a neat idea, but it's a little klunky in terms of software design, and it's not clear when your order has been placed, and whether or not you can easily add/remove items after the fact.

Some of the things we ordered didn't arrive until we requested them again, some never came. The ice cream we ordered came very early instead of at the end of the meal. There were communication mishaps with the servers. Food was a little slow in arriving at times.

All in all, the food was decent, and I expect that with more time, this place will get a little smoother. Given the limited options in the area, I expect it will be a success, but I'd suggest going when it's not terrifically busy for now, since they're clearly still sorting out how best to make it work."}
{"text":"This has been our regular sushi spot for the past few months. However, after yesterday we will not be going back ever again. I poured out the sauce into my little bowl and a fruit fly came flying out. I asked for another batch of the sauce, poured it out and there were 2 fruit flies. They saw it and brought my husband and I another bottle, SAME THING. This happened 3 times, dead fruit flies and live ones flying out of the sauce. Absolutely disgusting. In addition, the waiters do not even give us a discount or whole heartedly apologize. Instead, they told us it was happening the day before so they put the bottles in the fridge hoping the fruit flies would go away... thats disgusting, if there are dead fruit flies IN the sauce then why wouldnt you just get rid of this batch to begin with!? Never.going.again.

Try spring sushi or zem1, never had any issues at these places."}
{"text":"Long story short: If you like rice, this place is for you. 


Pros:  service and non sushi items

Cons: majority of sushi items had barely any fish. They put the fish on the surface so it looks normal until you bite into it. Order a handroll. I dare you."}
{"text":"4 stars for the amazing food.. The only thing I can say is the servers aren't the happiest bunch of people.. But overall great experience and defiantly a returning restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is shit. The rice to sushi ratio is ridiculously high, the ingredients are not fresh - my avocados were literally hard as a rock. 

They even managed to screw up the ice cream; the red bean tasted like coconut and the green tea tasted like soap. 

Stay away."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The ipad ordering is also very convenient and you don't have to keep trying to catch a waiter. Decently priced and well made"}
{"text":"I like this place. It might just be the grand opening show they are putting on but the food was great, the service was quick, and I couldn't argue with the 20% discount. Orders are taken on an ipad that is left on the table. At first I thought it was going to be annoying and overly complicated. Turns out it was kind of fun and seeing pictures of the items is nice. I hardly missed the paper and pencil. The fish seemed fresh. The sashimi and the fish for the nigiri were cut super thing but it's all you can eat so just order more. They also kept the ball of rice small so it matched the thin fish well, not overwhelming it. The maki were huge with fillings. Rainbow roll was great. Yam tempura roll had mayo which is still a little strange to me. My favorite AYCE dirty appetizer, cheese wontons, are featured on the menu. Everything was great except the egg tart for dessert. More scrambled eggs than custard and more phyllo than tart. The service was soooo fast. Like light speed. Servers could smile more but overall no complaints. $13.99 for weekday lunch, $20.99 for weekday dinner. The atmosphere is more like the big AYCE places in the suburbs than the downtown hole-in-the-wall ones. I'll probably go back.

Oh yeah... I forgot... They made cute vegetable art on the serving platters. My sashimi had a tree of celery and broccoli and a bunny made of a cherry tomato. Too cute."}
{"text":"i have to say, food wise the qualty was excellent. Decor was equally impressive. Ordering system took a little getting used to, but no missed orders. staff were adequately attentive to needs. bonus, they offer tuna sashimi. left feeling i got very good value for the money. excellent out of place addition to a dumpy neighbourhood"}
{"text":"It is one of the best ayce in town! They have the smoked salmon California roll which is the best! Also they have a great green tea and you can order on the ipad! Price is just perfect for the food quality! Service some times is not at the same level! But does not compromise much! Greet parking area!"}
{"text":"I have passed by this place numerous times and was always curious.  So when I got a discount flyer in my mail I decided to check it out.  Went in and noticed they had a 50% off for bdays and since it was my friend's bday we got 50% off his meal.

This is a buffet type of place except that you order via ipad and the food is brought to you.  It's large inside and can hold big groups if you want to have a bday party in here.

The food is ok - nothing spectacular but pretty good.  We tried a bunch of different rolls, spicy sushi, eggplants, fried rice and a few other dishes.  Nothing stood out as YUM...more like yum.  

It's close by so it's a convenient type of restaurant for me.  It's about $20-22 per person depending on what night you go for dinner, which I don't think is a bad deal.

The servers were half friendly and half not interested in what was going on, which makes me not want to go back...unless I get another coupon!"}
{"text":"Went in almost right when it opened, which might explain why some of the dishes came out so slow. Food is alright, but the menu for lunch seemed really small. Their eel sushi was good, as well as the eggplant appetizer. The mackerel appetizer was incredibly salty, don't eat it all in one bite! They have fried milk which i don't usually see in sushi places so that was kinda cool. Their mango mouse is fantastic, tastes like real mangoes. Overall its alright, especially for the price. It's 15 bucks for adults mon-fri and 50% off for bdays."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on the weekend. Food was good however the service was terrible. Majority of our food did not come. We informed one of the servers. Once again the food did not come. What had happened was our server kept bringing our food to the table behind us even after they finished and paid the bill. At this point I just wanted to leave. 

Once everything was sorted out we finally received everything ordered. We were ready to leave and pay but they messed up again by charging us dinner price instead of lunch. This was corrected to lunch but the experience was already ruined.

TLDR: constantly sent food to another table and then almost charged us dinner instead of lunch. Food tasted good."}
{"text":"I went there to see what it looked like as I am familiar with other restaurants designed by the same person. As expected, the design was quite modern but slightly minimal as if they had a tight budget. I am also familiar with ipad menus as they have been used by Spring Sushi (Yonge and Dundas) as well as 168 Sushi (Mississauga and Vaughn). My main complaint is with the boring and limited menu. There were less than 100 items compared to the more than 150 items on most of the AYCE restaurants that I have eaten at. The sashimi choices were very limited. This restaurant is an offshoot of a Waterloo restaurant and I suspect that they can get away with a limited menu in Waterloo. This place was having the usual teething problems of a new restaurant when I visited it, so it is not fair to comment on the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"We went here for an early lunch on a Saturday. Although, we were the first, the place filled up very quickly. 
We were served quickly. The fish was fresh and they had a lot to other items for people not as interested in sushi. 
Their tempura and chicken wings were good as well. 
Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"Hey -- this new spot on Don Mills is A-OK.

Mundane details:
- parking is a lot (not paid)
- use an iPad to order
- hot food comes nice and hot (love this!) 
- takes credit cards
- gives 20% discounts for seniors

We thought this spot was good.
Try the smoked chicken wings and teriyaki salmon.
Sushi nice and fresh.
Tempura was very good
They give you a carafe for tea.

Pretty decent selection including some Chinese offerings."}
{"text":"As I stated in my tip portion, I've been a rather loyal customer of this sushi place, considering its location is a less than 5 minutes walk from my house.

  I've seen this place change its quality from going rather good, to rather bad, then back again. I think a change in management changed a few things, and currently, it is for the better. The place is busy during peaks hours, such as lunch on Tuesdays (20% off orders) and dinner times during the weekends, and it is relatively quiet during off peak times. So it is expected that service is slowed down by some amount. But even then, the hard working waitresses get the orders taken and the food is delivered promptly. On occasion they have to be asked or reminded, but they are polite about their mistakes, and even have gone so far as to not charge me for food or drinks I genuinely disliked (I had a Margarita with way too much salt). 

  The food has been kept at quite the edible flavour, although, like most places, there is always a bigger fish out there. I have kept coming back for their sushi, mainly the BBQ eel (hand roll, sushi, etc), and their salmon. While my personal preferences let me avoid certain menu items, like their pizza, I'm sure many would find it delectable given their selection. They've added a Chinese menu, which does leave something to be desired, so you're better off going to a Chinese focused restaurant for that. 

 In the end, my only real complaint is that this place could truly be a fantastic sushi place. It has a wonderful menu system using an iPad, and the decor looks just like something you might find along a busier street downtown. There are certainly far better sushi restaurants throughout the city that offers all you can eat, but given the neighbourhood and the price for this food, if you keep your options open, and with a little patience, you could find yourself having a rather enjoyable meal. I come here often, and I see myself coming here again and again. 
  One more thing. They've recently added a liquor license to their repetoire, and just as a fair warning, it's new. Order at your own expense, for now, but like everything in this restaurant, it will get better over time."}
{"text":"I like the iPad ordering system. Sushi is decent enough on the AYCE side of things. Have only been here for lunch. This isn't my area and I wouldn't make a trip for it, if I was in the mood for sushi and was in the area though...I'd check it out again."}
{"text":"My wife brought me here for a causal date night a couple months ago & we discovered they have the best sushi in the area (keep in mind we can only eat cucumber avocado rolls, edamame & rice). The portions are great for what we order & the prices are nice & affordable. 

The service is ok, nothing bad, nothing amazing. As I'm sure you've read you order off an iPad. I don't really like that feature but I don't really care. The food come fast & is fresh.


My big pet peeve about the place is they say they deliver but they don't. I've called pretty much every other day for the last three weeks & every single time they tell me a lame excuse. One will say the driver was sick but will be back tomorrow then when you call they say oh we don't deliver today (On a Saturday) & ects. It's unbelievably annoying! I know they're lying to me. Just say you don't deliver then. 

Overall I will be coming back here. I'm actually writing this review before I go eat there."}
{"text":"First time trying this place hoping it would be like the usual ayce sushi places I like. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. 

To start, the sodas we ordered were flat... I told them it was flat after our first round and our second round was still flat. Also, a McDonald's straw appeared in one of our glasses... (Emphasis on the \"...\")

The food from the kitchen came first, as with most ayce sushi restaurants. However, waiting for the sashimi took longer than usual and the restaurant did not appear to be busy. When the sashimi came, I was very disappointed as it was very sub par quality even for an ayce sushi restaurant. I know it's not going to be amazing, but I expect it to be at least pleasurable to consume. The maki was heavy on rice and cucumbers - no, we did not order cucumber maki. The nigiri was heavy on rice... see a pattern here?  

The only good part about this restaurant is that the food from the kitchen is quite good, which explains the 2 stars, but I came to eat sushi, not Japanese/Chinese hot food..."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised with some of the ratings here! Given, I have never been here with a groupon. Every single time I've been here (around 10 times) has been for AYCE dinner on the weekend. 

I love the iPad menu. Being able to see pictures of everything before hand gives me a better idea of what I'm ordering, and I like not having to flag servers to my table. There's the handy \"call server\" button on your iPad. 

I have no complaints about the food or service. Everything comes out fast once you place your first order. I've had a couple of mess-ups here and there, the wrong thing being delivered to my table, etc. But the staff are always apologetic and quick to fix it. 

I like the selection on the menu. The only downside is the desserts leave much to be desired. However, who really needs dessert after AYCE sushi?"}
{"text":"VERY similar to the \"I Heart Sushi\" location in Mississauga's Heartland. Their options are good, and the quality wasn't bad at all. Overall a nice AYCE location. But I will say...they use REAL Japanese curry and their chicken cutlet with curry is fantastic."}
{"text":"My friend refer me to this place
this is a very cool place...never used an ipad to order food...lollll
I dont know why so many negative reviews....
I personally think this place worth the money!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend Bogdan took me here last week - and now I understand why. The place is all you can eat, the service is good, they have a lot more than \"just sushi\", the prices are fair (especially since Bogdan paid for the meal). My only disappointment was that the menu was short on some of my favourite things like sweet and sour pork or sweet and sour chicken. But oh well. I gobbled up everything and followed up with 1 scoop of chocolate ice cream and 1 scoop of vanilla. I am planning to take my girlfriend back there again sometime."}
{"text":"Was driving by with sushi on the brain,  saw it and decided to stop and try it.  Being in a pretty \"ghetto\" area I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. Very contemporary style and I love the Ipad touchscreen menu! The hostess was very nice and walked me through how to use the menu and to place an order. \"very cool\" I thought,  as I settled in and promptly received the green tea I had asked for. 

I thought I stumbled upon a gem and was taking pics and texting my brother to tell him about this very cool place I found..  Even the food was so beautifully presented! 

Then...  I took the first bite and my Shiny, sparkling gem turned into a piece of clumped up clay. It tasted..  Watered down and just..  Ok.  I was disappointed. I ordered more seeing I paid $14 for this Ayce sushi lunch hoping it would get better. But.. It didn't. 

While extremely stylish and cool looking,  I won't be coming back here.  The food just isn't up to par and except for the hostess, the wait staff leaves much to be desired. 

The slightly higher rate is clearly for the atmosphere and cool touchscreen menu. 

Unfortunately the food is sub par. 

Too bad. :-("}
{"text":"Clean and neat place whoch offers good sushi at a very reasonable price. Tried the sashimi and it was fresh. Maki rolls are delicious... Not a big fan of their typical maki's, but their special ones are really good... All u can eat option also worth it if u think u will have couple of rolls or a variety of items."}
{"text":"Ordering system was nice , food was not good . I did not like fish I ordered or the spring rolls and the sushi , fish was dry and smelled very bad , spring rolls were dry and tasted bland . for that price I think I could have gotten way better food somewhere else ."}
{"text":"It's now called Osaka!
This is my second time being here. The new management is great. The waiter are very nice and fast when you need a refill for your drinks. The aye sushi was fast and hot. Overall love the new management and will be returning back."}
{"text":"new owners/servers/ and restaurant name. 

huge improvement in customer service. but the food seems to still taste the same, not much on menu but desserts are good"}
{"text":"had the bento box b
starters were a green salad, miso soup and 6 pieces of salmon maki.

The bento came with 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, some veggies tempura, rice, chicken teriyaki, 2 pieces of gyoza, a little bit of seaweed salad.
pretty standard in regards to food.

an interesting feature is that you order through an ipad which i've heard about but it was a first for me. interesting but unnecessary. a very expensive menu is what it is.

they also have all you can eat here and i would have no problems coming back to try that in the future."}
{"text":"Didn't believe the bad reviews so my husband and I decided to try it out for dinner tonight.  It wasn't busy yet we still waited at the door.  The staff walked like they were going for a stroll in the park.  Our server was either really tired or on something.  Totally zoned out.  No hello, no goodbye, no talking.  We are accustomed to bad service when dining at any Asian restaurant but this place takes the cake!  

As for the food, the sushi was made too big and the rice was overcooked.  The sauce put on top the sushi made it look like it had been sitting there for a while.  Like soaked and mushy.  The rest of the items were OK at best.  We both wished we went to Yokohama instead."}
{"text":"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!!

You now order with an ipad! Yay innovation! No more waving down servers!

I came for lunch with my girl friend, it added up to about 40$ for a Wednesday lunch but not bad considering you;ll have to cough out 15$ for sushi anyway.. Why not add another 5$ for UNLIMITED FOOD!!!!!!!!!! :P

Food is overall pretty Y-U-M-M-Y! I am VERY impressed with menu selection, quality, and how hot the hot food comes out! 

I don't need to describe how great it was, just experience it yourself."}
{"text":"The value you get for the lunch menu makes this place passable if you need to feed a starving horde quickly and cheaply. Food was decent. But then again, I was eating out of pure hunger. 

Decor was typical pre-fab Chinese modern: a dark interior punctuated by oddly curated 'modern art' design details. But again, when starving, who cares about the decor? As long as it isn't filthy, it's fine. 

Though I gotta say, the service was excellent. The waitress was able to seamlessly switch between three different languages depending on which person in our party she was talking to. Props for mad skills.

Last thing: Leave your bandage miniskirt at home and wear the elasticated pants."}
{"text":"Itamae offers both all you can eat buffet and regular lunch/dinner, but I will be talking about the all you can eat (as I believe it's a better deal at this particular place). 

Since this restaurant is located in such a location easily accessible by both public and private transportation, I commonly visit it with my friends and family. The restaurant works for both large and small groups, with a variety of tables in different sizes. They even have a private room for extremely large groups!

They update their menu (which, being displayed on an Ipad is certainly unique and enjoying to order with everytime) regularly, so you won't ever get tired of their food choices. They do put a lot of work into the aesthetics of their food, I must say. Every dish is a piece of art!

All in all, they have a wide selection of food choices (and quite a large range of sushi options as well), so there's definitely a dish for everyone, ranging from Chinese cuisine to endless sashimi. 

My only complaint about this place is that often their sushi will contain quite a bit of rice, so don't eat too much sushi if you want to save room for other foods. As well, their soups can be extremely salty, containing lots of MSG, and will make you quite thirsty. Lastly, like most buffets, if you have leftover food, they will charge you.

Take your family, your friends, your coworkers, anyone will enjoy this restaurant. :) Just make sure you get enough Ipads for your group.

{"text":"2.5 star...

food is 4 stars... just everything else brought it down.

my second time here... this time because i had a groupon.

Things work quite differently.  i came with 3 people... so apparently the groupon was for 2 people ONLY.  Therefore the 3rd person MUST order something on a separate bill aside from the voucher amount.

Therefore we had 50 dollars worth of food but the 3rd person must order an additional roll in order for us to be \"allowed\" to use the groupon.

sneaky deeky in my opinion.. nowhere in the fine print does it say this unspoken rule.  Anyways... service is not great because they use IPADS to order for AYCE.  Took a long time to get a hold of someone... no chopsticks/no wasabi/ no soy sauce at our table even when the sushi came out.  

as for the food... presentation is excellent .. serving size is not bad at all... the sashimi combo 14.95 offers HUGE pieces of salmon sashimi..  often double the size of any other place i have been to... i had to cut it into 2 pieces to even fit it in my mouth it was so thick.


the only downside aside from the service. is when you pay  they will literally tell you.. you have to tip us on the full amount.. 50 dollars plus the roll you purchased...  oh yea.. and prepare for them to hover and breathe over your neck while you pay.   BOTH times i came they stand there waiting for you to pay and to see how much you tip... litterally apron pressed on your table just hovering over your shoulder like a ghost.  
I hate places that do that...

they demand a generous tip when service is not good.. (rudely too may i say)?"}
