{"text":"We had dinner here for my dad's birthday. The food was excellent. The wait staff was friendly, but dinner dragged on for over three hours. In short, good food but really slow service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my dad. Nice decor. The food is very good but if your looking for steak in particular than I suffers going to the octagon which is right down the street. I tried the ny strip steak and the seafood pasta and the pasta was very god but I would rather the steak at octagon"}
{"text":"I am writing this review the day after visiting the restaurant, and subsequently falling ill from the meal. Today is the last day of 2016, and I can easily say this is the worst overall dining experience I've had this year, and quite possible last year as well. 

Firstly, let me openly state that my wife and I are food snobs. We search for the best food everywhere - we have eaten amazing meals in roadside shops in Jerusalem and Bangkok, eaten our way through Spain and had life-changing sushi in Japan. We can point you in the direction of the best fried chicken in a 500 km radius from home, and we will chase food trucks and restauranteurs when they deserve it. I don't take time to review dining experiences often, mostly the outstanding ones, and this was an outstandingly atrocious one. 

If you read website reviews for a restaurant and see a trend of \"great, great, great, terrible\" reviews, there are two likely scenarios. One: the restaurant is truly good, and the bad review came from a disgruntled diner; two: the main clientele for the restaurant is unrefined, and the bad review came from a sophisticated diner. I would, without a doubt, now state that the latter is the case for this restaurant. However, my wife having grown up in the area and hearing for years about this place, we decided to not judge a book by its cover (although the restaurant management certainly does, more on this below) and give it a shot. Certainly an experience to close a terrible year. 

The ambiance: nice decor, makes you quickly forget that the location is within a suburban strip mall. When we arrived, soft clubby music was playing, but quickly changed to enjoyable live jazz guitar. 

The wine: First sign that something was really off with this restaurant, $3000 bottles on the wine list, but when asked about an Ontario wine from a Prince Edward County winery we personally frequent, the sommelier indicated it to be from Niagara. Extremely sad that a supposed \"fine dining\" restaurant does not seem to be aware of Ontario's hottest new wine region, let alone know where their bottles are coming from. 

The food: Truly, very unimpressive, downright appalling for the price point. The tomato soup was only exciting if you've never have had goat cheese before. We have made better ones at home on a weekday night. Garlic potato soup was delicate and balanced well enough. Foie gras appetizer was acceptable, although quite small and buried within a croissant platform. Before our entrees arrived, a lemon sorbet palate cleanser was brought, which was appreciated. 
The risotto main was absolutely flat, with no layers whatsoever, and clearly not made smooth by the proper way risotto is cooked (that is, slowly and with the gradual addition of broth), but rather by over-adding cream. The gnocchi were nicely presented, browned on the pan, but simply served with, again, a flat, overly rich cream sauce. 

By the time our entrees had arrived, I noticed a fruit fly around the bread basket. One lone fruit fly, however, this is utterly unacceptable for an establishment serving $40-50 mains. Not to mention the $3000 bottles.
I should have asked to see the manager at this point, but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, which turned out to be a big mistake. 

The service: The staff are clearly trying very hard to bring a fine dining experience. Table was cleared promptly, water was refilled often, and although more than the one bottle of sparkling water we ordered was brought, we were only charged for one. Sadly, this is where the flare ends. Based on our experience with the food and the flies, we decided to forgo dessert. When the sommelier/manager returned to ask on our choice of dessert, I requested to speak to him in private. I politely informed him of the problems with the meal, and of my intent to present these on online reviews, as it is not fair to a restaurant to receive a scathing review for which no opportunity at reparation has been offered. The manager thanked me for the information and told me that he would relay the information along. After this, we received a small plate with complimentary crackers and Parmesan cheese slices, on which, tragically, another fruit fly arrived. We did not touch this plate. Following this, our full bill was delivered, with no apology from any management or staff member, and thus no attempt whatsoever at salvaging our experience. 

I must assume that, since my wife and I do not drive a European car, and since we came dressed to enjoy each other's company, rather than to impress other diners, the management thought it unnecessary to address our immeasurably disappointing experience. I would counsel anyone who remotely enjoys dining for the food itself, to avoid this establishment at all costs. If you don't leave Thornhill often, need to impress a suburban date with a unrefined palate, and don't mind the occasional fruit fly with your $200-300 bill, you will probably love this place."}
{"text":"Terra is very elegant, a wonderful place if you are in the mood for fine dining, not to mention the food is delightful. We had Nina and she is such a a doll, she really made our experience extra special."}
{"text":"This restaurant has never failed me. It's our go to for special nights out. Yes it's pricey but the food and service make it completely worth it. The waiters are very knowledgeable on the menu and provide wonderful service. 
My favourite dessert is definitely the chocolate torte. Some other standouts have been the oysters, quail dishes and sea bass. Absolutely everything I've eaten here has been amazing. My favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had dinner their for the first time and was delighted with the food and service.
Atmosphere is very cozy and the waiters are very nice with a good attitude. The tuna sushi starter was to die for!  I had the fish special which was amazing."}
{"text":"Exquisite!! 

OK first off. Don't expect your bill to be less than a $C note per person. You know you are in the right place by the Ferrari's in front. 

Now to the important part. Terra is the best fine dining experience you can find in Thornhill and maybe even in the GTA. Attention to detail is fantastic and the servers are very professional and courteous. They all are like that which tells me the management here is top notch. 

Go for the Ahi Tuna as an app. I have not found anywhere that comes even close. Also found the best tea here... Jasmine (mighty leaf) 

Special occasion, go to Terra!!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  If you want excellent food this is the place in Richmond hill for fine dining"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our 1st anniversary and it was perfect! Our server Mike, was absolutely great. His recommendation for wine was exactly to my liking. 

The food here is AMAZING! I do not eat meat, and there were so many options for me! We started with the arugula salad and lobster and Brie toasty which is to die for!! As my entree I ordered the sea food spaghettini and it was by far the best pasta I've had in the city!! For dessert we ordered the creme brûlée which was perfection. 

Our bill was very reasonable, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something special. I cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand the hype. For what we had, it was completely overpriced. The duck springroll appetizer was ok, The main courses (fish with risotto and lamb shank with polenta) were ok, but not worth the $45 (+tax + tip) per plate. And then $15 for each dessert (really???). There are very few options north of Toronto for decent food, so I can see how Terra stands out, but for the money, it does not make sense (might as well make the drive downtown). The service was very good and the decor was nice. For the same price, you get an out of this world meal experience at Marine Room in San Diego for example (try it next time you are down there and you will understand what I mean). Maybe worth trying once, but not sure I will come back."}
{"text":"Loved the food always fresh and made to prefection...amazing creme brule...staff is awesome, olive bread is delish...fresh oysters yummm...oh and the drinks!!!! Gotta try the berry martini its heavenly.
Good for dates..special occasions or just to eat some good food :)"}
{"text":"Birthday Dinner- what a bust!

Can't believe this place charges this much for food, especially when I have to ask for some basil for the buffalo mozzarella salad. Service was under whelming and over rated.

Not a place i'd visit again... Save your paycheck for better quality service and food!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  Food is exceptional however the French press coffee was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I have been there about four times over the last few years. The food quality and taste has been amazing every time I was there and the service is generally nice too (depending on the server though). It is a bit pricy to go often but I would say I enjoy this restaurant much better than well-know, popular fancy restaurants in downtown Toronto. They have a great menu for Valentine's Day if you would like to try prix fixe."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Their surf and turf is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Food was top notch. Server was a little stuck up at the end of the night. Perhaps because we were 6, 30 year olds spending big $. Will definitely go back again. The food was too good not to!"}
{"text":"We always get consistently good service and have enjoyed our food every time we've been there. It's a fun and lively atmosphere on weekends - typically with live music. I highly recommend it. 

Tips: you can't go wrong with the lamb."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant for a romantic dinner 
I found it expensive so it is a perfect place for special occasion
The tuna appetizer is amazing and the service is great
Overall great place just a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"I and my bf went here for dinner last weekend and we had a good time. They are a bit overpriced but its worth to try and the portions are smaller. The service was slow we had to wait 10 minutes till someone get our drink order. In overall it was ok."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in this area. If you like fine dining, you must try this place.  The service is excellent.  The waiting staffs are professional, knowledgeable and really friendly.  Food is refine and absolutely delicious.  The ambience is romantic.  I never get tired of coming here."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! The service is unparalleled, the food exquisite, and the live jazz really makes it a night to remember. A bit above the average price point but sure is worth every penny. 

We shared a dozen oysters and the kale salad. He had the pork quarter house with barley rissoto and I had the drunken seabass. Dessert was creme brulee and roasted apple tart. Everything was so delicious I wanted to go kiss the chef! 

Truly a lovely dining experience and will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Nothing spectacular. They are very heavy handed with their truffle oil on the fries. Owner/host is very awkward... made comments about us ordering a lot of food... then proceeded to tell us to take it easy on the fries... not impressed"}
{"text":"First off to all those reviews that say Terra is overpriced I just want to say you get what you pay for, is it pricey, yes, but if I want huge portions of cheap food I go to the Pickle Barrel(which I do go to) if I want a true dining experience I go to Terra. This is a truly a beautiful, elegant but not pretentious restaurant. From the moment we walked in we were taken aback about how beautiful and warm the atmosphere was. It was busy, bustling and had a great vibe. We sat at the bar for a drink until our table was ready, we were seated within 10 min of our arrival. The jazz band started and they were not to loud not to soft just perfect. The food....oh the food....beautiful....so good! Duck confit spring rolls and lobster Brie toasties-10/10
Potato soup and Caesar salad-10/10 
Rabbit special10/10
Grouper special 8/10 and the only reason why was because the black lentils were a touch salty. 
Cheesecake 10/10
Now on to the service. I've never and I mean never have had service that amazing (and we go out a lot)
Our waiter was friendly, attentive, present at the exact right time, explained the food we ordered and continued to fill our wine glasses.
Empty plates were whisked away quickly.
I was observing a table being set and the attention to detail blew my mind. The jazz band kept us entertained through the night.
This is a definite will go back restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to Terra after being there for the first time 3 years earlier. Overall, I found it even better than the first time out.

MENU: Better-than-average on a fine dining scale. The great thing about this place is that the menu is somewhat exotic without going way out there. Just enough for those who want adventure without committing to eat anything that might just freak them out. We're talking about venison, bison, ostrich, etc. Nothing too crazy. In my view, a menu should have some variety, but not too many choices. This fit the description 100%.

SERVICE: On both occasions, service was as good for a fine dining establishment. My most recent waiter went a bit over and above duty quite well, as my wife had some eating limitations that he managed to find solutions working with her, and I think he should be commended for his patience and understanding (I reflected this in the tip). Also, the guy was well traveled regarding wines, and while not a sommelier, had a stronger than normal knowledge of the wines at the restaurant, which is pretty much the most you could ask for.

ENVIRONMENT: Friday night has live jazz (bass, electric guitar, and sax trio) that started at 9:30pm. Can I say this is awesome? Why o why doesn't Toronto restaurants (let alone York Region ones!) hire more of this talent? It can't be that there isn't anyone around. And I know they don't charge a ton of dough to play relative to what a fine dining restaurant pulls in for a nights tally. So what is the hold up? It can get a little loud at peak time, but the place has pretty good sound proofing, so at least in the section I was in, it was very easy to speak to the company at the table.

OVERALL: Even holding them to a fine dining standard, Terra did as good a job as one could have hoped. Even with dietary restrictions, they were able to accommodate while at the same time not make a big deal of it. The food was great and the wait staff was very good. What else do you want, really.

There is a valet out front. USE THEM! Parking is limited and you'll find that it's simply worth it to use the guys out front to park your car, rather than driving around for who knows how long.

BEST FOR: Special occasion dining.  Go on a Friday when there's live jazz."}
{"text":"I think all those reviews been written by the restaurant owners. Because people in there normal health will never put good reviews. 1) food is not fresh ,we had a party of 15 people ,4 of them got seek. 2) service it OK not to the level that they pretend to be 3) the taste of the food is on low end, very far from a high level restaurant. 4) it unbelievably overpriced ,there is no any base for that . 

May  be if they wouldn't pretend to be an a luxury place, and start serving at list a fresh food ,only then you can consider them as low everich place. If you want to spend so much money ,look for plenty other places around the city"}
{"text":"Beautiful and excellent...without a doubt the nicest restaurant above Toronto's \"downtown core\"...everything we have ever tried is great.  Also have beautiful private rooms for group functions."}
{"text":"I came here with a date and it was really nice. We visited the restaurant on a weeknight so it wasn't too busy. I hear it gets really busy on the weekend; I would highly recommend you make a reservation if you plan to go then.

Our waiter was very attentive. He kept refilling our water glasses very efficiently (normally I have to flag down the waiter at least once; here my glass was always full) and he helped me choose a gluten and lactose free entrée, which was really good. 

The ambiance was really nice and the perfect setting for a date. I had the salmon entree and my friend had the veal. He said his dish was really good. 

Pros:
- The service was great!
- I really liked the ambiance
- It wasn't too loud so we could really get to know each other (it might be different on the weekend)
- The tea list is incredible!!!

So let's talk about the tea list. You know how at most restaurants they offer you a variety of 5/6 teas max??  Well, at Terra they had a list a mile long. They had oolong teas, tons of herbal teas, different rooibos teas and much more. As a tea lover, I was really impressed!  I tried the pear cinnamon tea and it was delicious! My friend had a black tea and he really enjoyed it. I also like how the black tea came out in an iron tea pot. My herbal tea came out in a metal tea press. Both were presented well and our waiter refilled our tea pots once we finished our first round of tea. 

I would definitely go back to Terra. It was a really pleasant experience."}
{"text":"2nd visit was superb. We explained the problems the first visit and the caring waiter looked after us. A great night with excellent food, wine and service.

A happy foodie ending."}
{"text":"Been there just for a drinks. Can say that staff is great. Very cozy atmosphere! Next time will try food and hopefully rate it as 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Terra makes the little details count.  While Terra sits on the pricey side, I have to admit that I had a pleasant 1st experience when I visited two weeks ago on the 23rd of December.

First off, we were greeted at the door and the greeters quickly took our coats and seated us promptly at a round table fit for a party of 9 people.  Despite the busy Christmas/holiday season, the wait staff made sure we were taken care of and that our food was served promptly.  Staff checked in on us at regular intervals, always making sure
our glasses were filled (with bubbly and/or water), and made sure we had enough bread to start off with.

We ordered several appetizers to share (foie grad, duck tacos, grilled octopus, oysters and the carpaccio I think), which unfortunately were slightly on the smaller side so we literally got a tiny bite size of each to sample.

After the appetizers, staff quickly cleared off the tables and brought us a fresh lime sorbet garnished with a mint leaf to cleanse our palettes.  This definitely was a nice little gesture before getting ready to devour the main!

I can't speak for other mains, but I ordered the branzino fish which was cooked to perfection.  It was not greasy, and was nice and moist.  More so, it was generously portioned along with the veggies that came as a side.  As for the veggies, they definitely tickled my tastebuds! I could tell that the kitchen staff had taken some time to flavour and season the veggies before cooking them.  Honestly speaking, I would go back just for the asparagus and potatoes!

Finally, I have to admit that I wanted to try the dessert but really didn't have enough room to try.  If I ever get the chance to come back, I'd definitely try their flourless chocolate cake!

All in all, I had a wonderful experience at Terra. The staff were friendly and professional, and the food definitely brings a smile to my face.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fine dining experience in Thornhill."}
{"text":"Amazing wine list. Great food that is served properly. Dinning here can be most often very good and other times amazing. I always enjoy the steak and fish choices available. Love the sashimi tuna appetizer here."}
{"text":"Tacky, overpriced craphole. Save your money, this place isn't worth it. I had to listen to crappy dance music in a gold room while eating a $200+ meal. Not worth it."}
{"text":"The service was really really good right off the bat. We came for a family birthday dinner. This was my first time eating at a restaurant where they served a palate cleanser (basically a lemon flavored sorbet) between courses, and it was interesting and surprisingly effective. I was really into it. My favorite part was definitely the dessert. I loved how every dessert came with an assortment of berries. I had the creme brûlée, which was made to pretty much perfection. The ambiance was also dimly lit and very upscale/dressy, which was nice. Terra is very expensive, but I would say that the experience is well worth it."}
{"text":"I attended an intimate wedding here and was blown away. 

The food was perfectly cooked even on the simple dishes on the menu. My biggest peeve with food is when you only taste one ingredient and everything else tastes like it.  Definitely not what happens here, I wish I had more and better words to describe this place."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to go if you want to impress a date! I have been here a few times and I am always more than satisfied with the food here.

The soup and salad here are both quite good. As for the mains, I usually go for the Salmon/Fish of the day or the Veal/Steak option. You can't go wrong if you choose these options. The roasted chicken isn't bad either, but I'm just not too big of a fan of roasted chicken. The desserts here are very good, if not amazing. I'm usually not the type that orders desserts much but I make sure to when I eat here. The chocolate desserts are very rich and the creme brulee is made just right.

Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a fancy restaurant with good food in this area.

Food: 10/10
Service: 10/10
Atmosphere: 8/10"}
{"text":"The food and Service were excellent. Our server Andrew was top notch and attentive and the other staff members made sure that everything was served hot and to our liking. 
  I felt the price was a bit high...lets face it the restraunt is in a strip mall in Markham not some posh building in midtown/downtown Toronto. the atmosphere outside Terra is pretty non existant. I had to park around the side of the mall in front of some flower shop/loading door or garbage cans.

Pro- My black cod with Miso was amazing. Sides were fresh and not overly cooked or salted. Food presentation was excellent. Service was two thumbs up.

con- charging $25 for a small plate of penne with tomato sauce for my child ( I would not have a problem if you made the penne on site).  
Water was quite expensive. 
Coffee was served in a Bodum but plunged by the server before it had time to steep.

If money was not an issue for me it would be 5 stars no problem. I will go back and try the Sundaylicious prefix another time."}
{"text":"A great fine dining experience in Thornhill (don't always have to go downtown for fine food) a few girls and I came on a friday night, and the place was packed, even when there was a thunderstorm outside.

The waiter had excellent service, was attentive and did not disturbed us too much, but was there when we needed him.

The Assorted Appetizer Platter (for two or more people) at $24/person was a bit overpriced for what was inside in my opinion, 1 quail leg, 1 scallop, 1 shrimp, 1 tuna maybe small crab cake? not sure (I think that was about it) so for 2 person $50 for 2 x pieces each. It's a bit overpriced but it was delicious, each and every piece of it.

The food was very good, I don't want to get into detail of each but a special mention is that they have the best gnocchi I had ever had (had some bad experiences that made me hate gnocchi forever) but after having it here, I know to come back here for it. they were lightly grilled or pan fried perfectly and the sauce matched it perfectly.

there's a great selection of tea and comes with a plate of assorted cookies, I think their dessert menu needs more work/selection, maybe add a baked Alaska, souffle, or something unit. the creme brulee was way too sweet."}
{"text":"Tired of the overwhelming Asian food options near our hotel in Markham and too lazy to fight the Toronto traffic, my companion and I made last-minute reservations to Terra on a Sunday evening.

The restaurant is located in a typical GTA-style strip mall, which made us slightly suspicious as the restaurant advertises \"fine dining\". However, once we were inside, we forgot all about the exterior. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and noise level was lively but unobtrusive.

After we put in our order, we were offered a basket of bread and butter, both at room temperature (good for butter, not so much for the bread). We shared the Caesar salad, which was light and salty (in a good way). The scallop and pork belly appetizer was delicious but the scallops were salty (in a bad way) and we wished the single piece of pork belly was larger. We received a mint and lime sorbet after the appetizers were cleared... it was so refreshing I could have eaten a whole bowl of it! I had the pea and smoked duck risotto (daily offering) and my companion had the rib eye steak. Both entrees were delicious and fair-sized. Our waiter brought us a small plate of cheese (I think it was Romano) and crackers while we checked out the dessert menu but we were too stuffed after our entrees.

Overall, the staff were attentive and polite and the food was undeniably good but I do think it's a tad overpriced. Good fine-dining option in the Thornhill area (as the restaurant claims) if you are too lazy to venture into Toronto."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  We often go for special occasions since it is close by and you don't have to trek downtown for the same quality (if not better).  Even their Sundaylicious menu items are as good as their a la carte ones.  We ordered from this menu and just tried their white bean and truffle soup and it was absolutely fantastic.  So flavourful with sauteed mushrooms and a hint of their house smoked pork belly!  I went with the chicken which is always good.  I found that the mashed potatoes weren't as tasty as before however.  Other people at the table ordered the black cod (awesome) and the steak for an extra charge but was definitely worth it.  The desserts were equally fantastic.  I love the warm chocolate torte!  The creme brulee was very smooth and not too sweet.  The cheesecake was a delicious surprise as it had a hint of passion fruit!  I can't wait till the next time we visit!"}
{"text":"The food and service at Terra was great.  I had just gotten off the plane from Paris to celebrate my dad's birthday with my parents for dinner at Terra.  Food was amazing and portions are descent.  

We started to share the hand picked organic lettuces as a starting salad and it was surprisingly good.  I ordered the grilled ostrich fan filet which was prepared just right at medium rare.  Usually, I tell the waiter to prepare is rare for any read meat just in case the kitchen overcooked the meat but it was perfect.

My parents had  seafood spaghettini and the highly recommended miso-maple marinated black cod.  Both dishes were great as seafood options and I would highly recommend them.  To top it off, I gave them the macaroons that I brought back from Paris and they beautifully prepared it on the dessert plate with no questions asked.  It was a perfect end to the evening."}
{"text":"What a joke not worth it. Service was crap and the server was eating oysters non stop while trying to serve costumers. Bass boys was putting there finger in our dish while pointing out our dishes. Dirty bar floor too. In downtown its gonna be a joke, never again for $400,What a scam Although valet the parking was good."}
{"text":"Amazing & classy restaurant! A reason to get dolled up and got out for a nice evening. The ambiance was perfect and it's a beautiful place to go for a special date or celebration. I ordered their fish for my main which was delicious and light. And be sure to order their warm flourless melt in your mouth chocolate torte. Omg it's to die for! You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"First time coming here without any expectations, after leaving I was impressed.
A fine dining experience with enhanced customer service superseded our expectations.  Located just south of 407 on Yonge, Terra focuses on contemporary, fusion cuisine in a calmly beautiful setting even though I found some of the decoration not traditional.  More like contemporary, futuristic, industrial disco feel all at the same time lol. You'll see what I mean when you go there.
As for food and drinks, here's the what we had:

**Bottle of Sangiovese
**Oysters, served on a bed of ice with three types of sauces to compliment the dish.
**Foie gras was beautifully down, the quality was superb.
**Paella Risotto, presentation was beautifully down, great melody of flavors and the risotto was done well.
**Gnocchi- delicious, and prepared to perfection.
**Ultimate Brownie for dessert, this was decadent and I highly recommend if you love chocolate chip, cookie and ice cream.

Overall, a lovely evening and experience!"}
{"text":"Really, one of the best oysters I have had, came from this restaurant. 
Service is mediocre - if you're coming with a big party, the long wait can be excessive 
Fine-dining with correlating ambience 

Food - of course, is what keeps me coming back. Quality food. Though it is a bit over priced 
 Overall, a great restaurant. Thoroughly impressed everytime, with regards to food 

On my second time here for a birthday, be aware they charge for cake plating. I'd advise to go elsewhere for big parties"}
{"text":"Very nice place! My friend had his 30th bday party here. They set us up in a party room that was separated from the main area, so it felt private, but we could still see the dining room. The food was good. We got oysters, ribeye steak and cheesecake for dessert. Everything was tasty. 
I took one star off because of the prices. While it's a nice place I think the food was a bit overpriced. I would probably return for summerlicious where you get a bit more value for your buck."}
{"text":"Interesting game options of elk and bison. Super attentive service. Willing to customize their dishes. Causal atmosphere. Decent wine by the glass. I recommend it."}
{"text":"First time out, celebrating the launch of a new company with my wife.

We did have a drink while waiting for our table. The bars staff was switched on and served us quickly. We people watched for less than 10 minutes and caught the jazz 3 piece playing at the perfect level. Not to loud, not too soft.

There was a good crowd that evening. I had made reservations earlier in the day, and requested a quiet table in the back somewhere. That's exactly what we got. Tucked away in a nice corner, I had a chair and my wife was on a nice comfortable overstuffed bench. The atmosphere was excellent. Conversation was audible from neighboring tables, but not quite loud enough to hear, unless you actively eavesdropped, which we did. It's as much a part of the experience as the meal!

Our server was top notch. He was there at just the right times, he watched our glasses from a distance, and I often caught him scanning his area to see if anyone wanted some attention.

Food was spectacular. That's not overstated. I am not unfamiliar with good food. I've paid more for less in the past. As with all things in life, good service makes up for poor food and good food makes up for poor service. We have both excellent food AND excellent service, so the night was magical.

The wine list is to die for. They have an excellent cellar. I managed to control myself and had an superb Cabernet recommend by our waiter. It was all I could do not to indulge in the 71 Chateau Haute Brion (don't ask the price). I may go back for it if business does well. Really well.

Overall, for my first and only visit so far, I was quite blown away. I will have to reserve judgment further until I can go again. And I will be going again."}
{"text":"This place is okay. They do try make everything feel upscale, however the complete restaurant had an overwhelming stench of seafood.  Not pleasant for someone who doesn't care for seafood. Service was decent and jazz music very loud. Expect to pay around $120-140 a head for 3 courses and a modest glass of wine. Went with friends. Everyone felt their choice was okay. No one was particularly impressed with anything! Feel that there are many other options with nicer food for less. But I guess you pay for the pretentiousness of this place. Personally I can live without it."}
{"text":"I'm going straight to the point and will say I was served great food by an attractive, attentive (and hilarious) waitress.

We were a party of 3 and with no reservations on a busy Saturday night were graciously appointed a table after some wait.

Waiting for our food however took longer than expected, luckily their (stale and unimpressive) bread and butter kept us busy.

I had the crab cakes and the baby arugula salad. Big fan of their Gorgonzola cheese and candied pecans on the arugula salad. They were a bit minimal on the vinaigrette, but the crab cakes were gorgeous.

Total bill was a little more than expected considering they charged us $20.00 for a 2 piece jumbo shrimp side. Guess those shrimps must've been blessed by Jesus himself  to be worth 10 dollars a piece...

Good food. Overpriced. Will be back if someone offers to pay the bill...."}
{"text":"My experience at Terra starts with a bang! That \"bang\" is Jenny, both hostess and waitress. With a great deal of confidence and courtesy, Jenny greeted us, asked where we wanted to sit then suggested (almost at the same time as I started thinking) an alternate table for two away from a draft on a cold day at the front door.

The table setting is refined with a crisp table cloths, clean cutlery and glasses and comfortable chairs. There is a variety of seating options and getting their early for lunch or dinner will allow you more choices. However Terra is a favorite of many regulars in the area and I suspect many tables are reserved for their best guests. They also have a private dining area for larger groups.

The food is excellent and not cheap. Paying $13 for a tomato soup may seem excessive however when a very hot plate arrives with some crumbled goat cheese and basil and the waitress pours the steaming hot heirloom soup from a small tea pot you realize that it is worth every dollar. The Heirloom Tomato soup was excellent!

I would have given Terra 5 stars however they forgot my dessert. How a restaurant forgets a dessert with a largely cleared out lunch crowd at 2:15pm is hard to understand. Perhaps they were busy getting ready for dinner. Or maybe someone was telling me I didn't need dessert. It's good that Symposium Cafe is just a few doors south with great cheesecake.

In order to enjoy Terra, you have to forget about the prices. Yes they are a \"tad\" high, but given the other choices in the immediate area, and the quality of the service, I believe the prices are not excessive. Trying to do this type of restaurant on a budget, never seems to work out well."}
{"text":"Normally, I'm not one to yelp except for really bad experiences but i feel compelled this time. You know the saying \"bad news travel fast\" i hope this does.  I was planning a family event and was looking for a nice restaurant to celebrate. For so called \"high end restaurant\" the service was terrible. I called and left numerous messages for the event manager and either got either very late responses or none at all.\" When i finally got through to event manager ( i think his name was Michael), He passed me on to someone else claiming he's too busy and out of town. 
I decided to go somewhere else. I don't think it's worth giving my business to a place that hires someone lacks good business etiquette customer service. A major part of enjoying a place is the customer service. Though the place appeared nice when we visited, the lack of service is a deterrent. I would not recommend this place for any event."}
{"text":"I feel awful for giving this negative review, considering I really love this place. The BF's family and I come here for dinner at least twice annually. We normally come here for their weekly sunday fixed price menu - which is well worth checking out.

 $39 for 3 courses

The most recent experience was not on par with the previously wonderful experiences I have had here; which unfortunately were before my pre-active yelp days. So I dearly hope that this review turned out to be a one-off mis-fire for Terra. Because I still honestly don't know what happened that night. 

The evening started out beautifully - with our starters arriving - not too long after we ordered. I ordered the bacon, jalapeño and lime soup - which was amazing. The flavour of the soup was smokey, spicy and just a hit of sour to awaken the appetite for the entree. 

Which took way too long in arriving; which kicked off the downward spiral. This was compounded by the wait staff more or less completely ignoring us in this stop gap between starter and main. After lengthy period of time, when I finally caught someone's attention, I had handed them my empty teapot and requested for more hot water - plus asked after our food - shortly thereafter the guy came back and said the food was on the way - before he ran off, I asked after my missing hot water.  He said it was on the way - then disappeared. After about 15 minutes, food started to come out and was about to be put down - when the service guy was about to put it down, he got into a conversation with a co-worker at which point he did an about face and walked back into the kitchen with our food - no explanation or anything as to why they were taking the food away... 

After another period of waiting (which during I still hadn't received my replacement pot of water), we ask again about our food -  someone else comes out to explain and apologise about the delay in the mains coming out, as apparently there was a miscommunication - so the kitchen was cooking our orders now (3rd request for hot water gets inserted here) - at which point it has been at least an hour since we finished the starter. After another 5 minutes, the mains finally come out (hooray, but my water still hasn't arrived - insert 4th request) 

My roasted half chicken is wonderful - but I think my carrot was still raw, because it was Bugs Bunny crunchy - but after the ordeal of trying to get my pot of hot water (which had finally arrived) and main - but I think every little thing was bugging me at that point during the dinner. 

Dessert went without incident, I just ordered their fruit - but the Bf and his family order the flourless chocolate torte and upside pineapple cake; which arrived hot and steaming.  They said it was quite delicious and on par with the past visits. 

I've already stated what bothered me most about this recent visit - but here is the thing - if you ignore my big fat rant in the middle about massive service fail - Terra is quite wonderful, I would even deem it worthy of the 5 stars everyone else gives it.

But unfortunately, this visit rated only 3 stars - because I have to say Terra, I honestly expected better from you -  because you normally knock my proverbial dining experience socks off.

Side note : the usual embellishments like the palate cleansing sorbet between app. and entree ; as well as the cheese and lavash between entree and dessert were missing. (although I don't know if they just forgot or stopped doing it)"}
{"text":"This is one the best stake house in town, very nice environment, excellent service and very good food.
Really recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to. I had the seafood pasta and it was amazing! This restaurant is very price but totally worth it. The dessert was killer.. Tried the cookie that was made to order and it was beyond expectation. Very dressy restaurant so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean. Service was friendly.  For was high quality and menu choices were good,  especially the wine men.  Not two things.   For a high end restaurant,  there are playing nonstop music with a strong beat,  like you went into a Stitches fashion store--awkward and annoying.  All,  the Asian faces seemed to have been all grouped in one area of the restaurant.  Which was weird,  and somewhat offensive."}
{"text":"Nice decor and great ambience. The service was excellent and the food was great! Tried their seafood spaghetti, delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day and had the prix fix menu they had and we really enjoyed it! The food was great and the portion sizes were big (we ended up taking some home). Our server was really nice too! Overall great place to try if you're looking for a fancy restaurant in Thornhill!"}
{"text":"overpriced and service was a glacial pace for 1pm on a weekday. The only seasoning used in these dishes was enough salt to spike my sodium levels for a year"}
{"text":"Excellent environment and service. Food was very good but portions small for the price. They should have a dress code though.  A high end place but the people we sat beside wore sweatpants and t-shirts.  That kind of brought the \"fine dining\" experience down a little."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Terra a month ago and the food was delicious! We came on a slower day (Monday) so it wasn't very busy. The service was great, and our waiter was pleasant and very helpful with the menu. I am a huge fan of gnocchi so I had to try theirs and my husband had the rack of lamb. The gnocchi was to die for! It practically melted in my mouth & the creamy sauce was just right. I had a bite of the rack of lamb which was also very good, perfectly grilled and flavored. Also loved the lime sorbet to clear our pallet! I believe its reasonably priced for the quality of food you're getting therefore if you're celebrating an anniversary or special occasion I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day dinner with my mom and brother. Ordered 3 entrees (seafood pasta, mushroom risotto, seasonal item which was deer meat plus mash potato) and one potato soup. Bill came to $170ish after tax. I think it was overpriced. Food was yummy but I've paid about the same for a 3 to 5 course meal that was equally delicious if not better."}
{"text":"The service really made the experience here excellent. From the moment we walked in we were treated very well by all of the staff. The restaurant decor itself was kind of confusing and not necessarily my taste, but to each his own. Patrick was our server, and probably one of the best I've ever had. He had an excellent sense of humour which made the experience that much better! The jazz band is definitely a nice touch! We ordered an assortment of oyster, which tasted fresh and the accompanying sauces were delicious. The steak fries and sautéed rapini were good, but truthfully a bit over price for the cut we received and portion. The apple crumble did not really taste like a crumble and wasn't impressive. The couple we went with ordered the cookie and it looked delicious. Last note the coffee and espresso were excellent really ended the night off on a great note. Keep up the awesome service!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent service first class ! The food was delicious my rack of lamb delicious . My wife and daughter had the gnocci was great but they forgot to serve without truffle oil although it was tasty. The seafood pasta was exceptional . My oysters were very fresh as was the ahi tuna just the right mix of wasabi and seaweed salad ... My rack of lamb was delicious a must . Dessert was great chocolate flourless torte vanilla creme Brûlée and sorbet yum as was the specialty coffees .. Overall exceptional although price was as well ..."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I like the martini's ie) cosmos. The food... Well in my opinion, for people who have more money than taste. I had soft shell crab and it was not a pleasant experience and I felt I was routing through tons of cartliage before finding some meat. The service is great. But I have found some better places in the area."}
{"text":"For the longest time, this was one of my favourite restaurants.  But a couple years ago I started to find that it was going a little downhill.  The food was still really good and so was the service, but something about the food just wasn't as good as it was before.  It's hard to pinpoint what the change was.  

I've been going to this restaurant for years and I have seen it go through a few transitions over the years.  I'm hoping it was just a blip and it is back t the wonderful, high quality thornhill restaurant I always loved.  There are no enough really good restaurants in thornhill.  I would hate to see this one go really downhill.

If you've never been to Terra before, I recommend the Gnocchi.  They are larger potato pieces that you would see in other restaurants and they are panfried before the sauce is added.  It's really worth trying."}
{"text":"The way one is treated from start to finish determines the level of overall satisfaction at some venues. Valet service and a friendly coat check started off the evening in a formal way, and elevated my expectations for the meal. 

Excellent service and a pleasant decor adds to ones experience. Terra offered multilevel seating, dark colours, looks like the crowd is mostly loyal clients of 15 years +. This restaurant serves continental food for companions, grown up or business partners, this is fine dining.

As an appetizer I tried the seared ahi tuna. The spicy wasabi sauce cut into the flavours of the tuna however a lovely citric tomato/fruit chutney was paired beside livening the dish without over bearing sweetness. 3 out of 5

My 10oz beef filet cooked to order, medium-medium-well, came hot and tender, with fingerling potatoes and a little jeu. Excellent, 4.5 out of 5

My dessert was decadent and plentiful. 4 out of 5.

I would return if I was in this area, perhaps try the octagon steakhouse as there is more to try than space in my mouth."}
{"text":"Usually when I want to celebrate special occasions but want to stay up in the suburbs without going downtown, I go to Octagon.. But after dining here at Terra Restaurant, I am so impressed and now it becomes the Go to restaurants if one want to celebrate or impress!! 

Classy, Chic and Modern decoration.. good for all occasions. Service was excellent! One of the best I have, attentive, helpful and professional. 

The main though pricey..but all nicely done.. and so delicious!!! 

Baby Arugula Salad ($14.95) 
- Our waiter split that in half portion for us to share... (Maybe I want to have the salad all for myself! :P)
- Light vinaigrette dressing with blue cheese and caramelized walnut.. I love walnut!! 

Lime Sherbet was served to clear our palate, before our mains: 

Grilled Bison Tenderloin (8oz) with Foie Gras ($44.95) 
- Waiter suggest how the meat best to be cook to medium rare...which is my preference anyway 
- really lean but so tender.. not gamey at all.. and nicely filleted finished off with a balanced gravy 
- Foie Gras.. exterior seared and Mmmm good (I ate that whole tiny piece since my DC is not into that!) 

Grilled Mixed Seafood ($37.95) 
- Waiter suggest the fish to be cooked medium 
- Salomon, sawfish, cod, tiger shrimp, big scallop, king crab, squid just to name a few 
- All of sampling portion, lightly seasoned!!. and all fresh and tasty.. I would have a hard time if I force to decide if I only allow to order just one!! 

Cheese and Cracker served while we decide on dessert :

While reading the dessert menu, I am so impressed with the loose leaf tea selection ($3.95-$14.95) they have.. One of the best I encountered in a sit down restaurant aside from a tea house.. And all of them according to the menu description are whole leafs tea!! 

French Press Coffee ($3.95) 
- A little weak and watery.. I wondering if they have a stronger brew.. I ended up drinking the coffee black.. though it smell really good 
- Terra should have a more extensive coffee menu... 

Warm Flourless Chocolate Torte with Ice Cream ($11.95) 
- I am glad that I decide to order ONE dessert to share.. it is sizable and I barely able to finish my half portion 
- Rich and chocolaty and fluffy and light at the same time! Heavenly Good!! 

Terra is not cheap!! I definitely think it is worth the price tag. At least the food is really good, reasonable portion and excellent services... I will be back... especially if there is another group buy deal again!!

Now guys you know where you should take your date.. hint hint! Or you can always come for a night cap and dessert!!"}
{"text":"Came here during valentines and it was very busy. My girlfriend and I looked at the menu online ahead of time and was very excited to get their pastas. We were kinda disappointed when we found out that we could only order from their special valentines menu (which has no pasta).  

We ended up ordering their oven roasted chicken and Australian rack of lamb. Although a little pricey, they were very delicious. Neither my girlfriend and I left a single bit to waste.

The service was very good although it was kinda slow (understandable due to large volumes of customer). Our server would regularly check up on us and was very polite.

I would recommend Terra if you're looking for a romantic meal with your partner."}
{"text":"Many restaurants come and go in suburbia, but Terra has been serving fine food for over 15 years and rightfully so. You really don't have to go downtown to have a nice quality dining experience, though there so many more choices. It has been a long, long time since I have been to Terra and my last visit there was pretty good.

Terra does a \"Sundaylicious\" pre-fixe menu for $39 which includes a choice of appetizer, main, and dessert. So I went on a Sunday to try it out. The Sundaylicious menu seem to attract the neighborhood crowd but it was surprisingly not very busy. The items on the Sundaylicious menu were a few selected items from their regular menu and a few specially prepared dishes. For some reason I didn't find the items on the Sundaylicious that inspiring (their menu changes based on sasonal ingrdients, so I must have been there at the wrong time) -- I suggest going with the choices with the supplemental charges, it is well worth it. The kitchen were out of the bison carpaccio, which I was disappointed, however the heavenly rich seared fois gras more than made up for it. 
Terra's wine list is lengthy with a good selection of bottles of all price ranges. 

Service was very good and attentive.

The food is well prepared and the ingredients are very fresh and good quality.  The dishes were good straight forward American/Italian food without any silly ethnic fusions or cliché plating. The amuse bouche at the start of the meal and the sorbetto pallate cleanser before the main were well appreciated.

The prices may seem very expensive for a suburban restaurant, but for those living in the York Region area it beats dealing with traffic and parking going to a restaurant downtown and there are very few fine places to dine like Terra in this neck of the woods. So it is actually well worth it.

My only gripe is that the decor of the restaurant is looking very tired and dated. Slate floors, multi-coloured glass partitions and knick-knacks, boldly coloured leather and velvet chairs, swirly motifs, venetian plaster walls, and busy lighting looks more like a glorified 90's Starbucks café than a sophisticated relaxing restaurant.  

Their tapas menu looks really good, so I will probably go back to try it out next time."}
{"text":"The Prix-fixe dinner at Terra Restaurant typically cost $39 per person excluding tax and tips.  Although, she had a buy-one-get-one Sunday'licious' giftcard, the meal still felt like a smack down on our wallets. This was our \"last supper\" before the start of the semester.  

Appetizer:

Classic Caesar Salad - Chopped romaine hearts, crispy garlic croutons, grilled corn, double-smoked bacon and creamy Caesar dressing

My bestie ordered this. She is a die heart fan of Caesar salad. We both agreed it got a little heavy. It was great when you take the first few bites but it got overwhelming soon after.  It was a fair classic Caesar salad. To be fair, it is what it is...bacon and cream! 

Hand Picked Organic Lettuces -  with toasted pine nuts, goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette (I requested blue cheese in place of goat cheese) 

To be completely honest, hand-picked organic lettuces sounded uninspiring. I can get organic lettuce from Sobey's or even Wal-mart. The server convinced me with table side romance. Apparently, a local farmer had bought over 20 different lettuce varieties into the kitchen. The executive head chef examined each type and selected an assorted mix of greens. This story could be completely fictitious for all I care...he was right! This was the best salad I have ever had. The salad denoted fresh.  The lettuces was crisp with varying textures. The pine nuts added crunch. The blue cheese added an extra level of complexity without overpowering the \"star\" of the dish -- lettuces. There was a perfect balance of oil and acidity. This salad was a demonstration of maturity and restrain from the chef.


Entrée:

Cracking oven roasted  1/2 chicken - With garlic mashed potatoes, garlic fried rapinin and natural jus

As a diligent foodie, I had googled every possible source to ensure I make an informed decision about my entrée prior to arriving at Terra. Yelp and Urbanspoon both had patrons raving about Terra's oven roasted chicken.  Due to my Asian heritage, I tend to think about the cost of goods VS cost...for example, seafood as a raw ingredient costs more than chicken...generally I would have ordered the a seafood dish, an item with a higher perceived value. (Strange...I know....I blame my parents!) However, the pictures of free range chicken on Facebook had lead me to opt for chicken. (Yes! I even Facebook restaurants in advance!)  The dish was faithful to the reviews online, it was delicious! The chicken was moist and tender. The jus was extremely flavorful. The aroma of garlic had really pull the dish together.  

Orchetti with Apple Wood Smoked Italian Sausage - Rapini, parmesan and tomato sauce

My bestie ordered the orchetti as she had never had orchetti before. It was unfortunately dry and over salted. I suspect it was due to the high sodium content of the house-made sausage. It was as though we were licking salt. The orchetti was luke warm.  It was lacking in acidity. She ended up finishing half my chicken instead. Our server concluded there was something wrong as the plate was practically untouched. He asked the kitchen to prepare a new dish for my friend with less sodium to take home. It was a good gesture. 

Dessert:

Crème Brule

As a lover of all crème brule, this a straight forward decision making process for me. It was an average crème brule. The biscotti was \"meh\"! We did not end up finishing it.

Warm Flourless Chocolate Torte

The chocolate torte my bestie ordered was \"different\". While it was not a bad dessert, it was not a typical torte. I felt like the density of the torte was off. If Terra had given the \"torte\" another name, it would been better. I was expecting a torte and had received a semi-fluffy cake of some sort. The cookie was crisp and nutty. It was a little too sweet. The acidity of the chocolate was not strong. Overall, it was slightly one dimensional.  We did not finish this dessert either. 

As usual, I had a great time with my bestie at Terra Restaurant! She is one in a million!  Anyone is lucky to have her in their lives! Overall, the restaurant was good, my wallet, however died a little inside!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant ,very attentive waiters always with a smile . Now to the food we had the Sundaylicious which was realy worth it . Food was amazing , great portions , bread was fresh and kept coming all the time . Appetizers Mains and deserts were great ."}
{"text":"Terra is one of the fanciest restaurants in the Richmond Hill area. By fancy, I'm referring to the food quality/price and the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant. Outside the restaurant you'll feel like you're in any other strip mall.

We came here for a weekday lunch to celebrate my birthday. The place was pretty much empty as you'd expect for a high-end restaurant on a weekday in the middle of the day. There were a few tables with guests, but mainly business people.

We started off with some appetizers. She had the seared Ahi tuna that looked really good (I'm not a fan of Ahi tuna, but it looked amazing) and I had the soup with Italian sausage, which tasted great. The bread and butter were also very good. For our mains, she had the filet mignon and I had the halibut. The Angus beef filet was high quality beef and cooked well. We asked for medium, but it came a little more cooked than we liked. But nonetheless it tasted great. The halibut was also amazing. It was cooked extremely well. It was juicy and not tough at all. For dessert we had two scoops of chocolate ice cream with fresh fruit. Really good ice cream, really good fruit (raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc.). The final price was around $150.

Although service was good, it was very slow. We were on a tight schedule since she had to go back to work (I took the day off). It took at least 15 minutes to bring out the dessert.

So if you want to impress, are okay with splurging, and have time on your hands, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I tried the salmon. It was good but expensive. The atmosphere was nice, and the waiters polite. I liked it but I didn't love it."}
{"text":"Brought our daughter for her 16th birthday.  Waited a long time for food. The atmosphere does not call it for family restaurant. The expectation is for adult, couple type. Not a lot of lighting to take pictures. It seems the servants are trying to do their best but for the class of restaurant they don't seem to have the right experience. So don't bother it for family event. The steaks are seasoned and are burnt outside because of the seasoning. The salads are regular. Overall I could pay $450 for 7 people for dinner with no alcohol for much better places than Terra.
One last thing. They seem to forget things when we asked them for pepper or extra lemon or other things. Forget about getting them to you."}
{"text":"Somewhat fine dinning but not too expensive like the other ones in downtown Toronto.  The price is a bit high, but the portions are reasonable and the food tastes good! You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"You can't miss its logo, \"Fine Dining North of the Core\" as they try to advertise it wherever they can but I think they did pull it off. 

Terra is one of those Italian/American/Canadian fusion restaurants that serves fine dining food (steak, handmade pastas, lamp chops) with the proper dining experience and proper waitresses/hostesses. The price rance was definitely downtown prices but the food was executed well. Our family went last week and we had the black cod, mushroom risotto, and rotisserie chicken and had no complaints. The trick is to go on Sundays only when they have their Sunday-licious menu. At $39 per person, with app/entree/dessert included, its a price you can't beat for good food that is uptown. 

But on a normal weekday, I'd reserve this place only for a special date or a special occasion... Not a place I'd frequently visit."}
