{"text":"the best pizza we have ever tasted! we go to whitby every year and my boyfriend always wants to go here on his birthday. the pizza is divine and they do a range of unusual ice creams too including black pepper and chilli!"}
{"text":"Small and compact restaurant down the same lane as the Capt Cook museum. Booking is advisable, but you can still get a table if you just turn up, but it does get busy and you may be disappointed. Pasta dishes are around £9.95 and a 12\" pizza will set you back approximately £11.00. Beers, wines and spirits are served, coffee is also available. Nice atmosphere and you can see the chefs cooking the pizzas in the clay oven (if that's your thing) as you wait."}
{"text":"Oh dear, oh dear, what has gone wrong here? Last time I visited Whitby this was one of the highlights but last week the food was very poorly cooked and presented. My canneloni had a strange taste to it which I was unable to identify and my wifes fish with a caper sauce was so oily she could'nt eat most of it. The rest of my party were less than impressed too. The only saving grace was the very attentive staff and the excellant chilli ice cream, yes you read that right! Would think twice about going again, very poor Italian food."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing meal at Moutreys, as always The head chef asked what we fancied and suggested changing a few dishes slightly to accommodate, my husband loves seafood and had a scallop starter and Cajun salmon, which he said was amazing, (I cannot comment,; as he wouldn't share) he loved and ate it all. My food was lovely as always. Gary and his team do a great job and with the winter promotions in full swing, it's great for families, couples and those on a budgetThanks for a lovely evening and lovely food. X"}
{"text":"Booked for a table for two and was then forced to a seat under the stairs and next to another set of stairs with a less than pleasant smell of the toilets every time the door opened.  Service was charmless, abrupt and not fitting Yorkshire.  Pizza was average, dough tasted frozen, as it had no texture like regular risen dough.  Loud music, poor service, zero ambience and mediocre food.  Gordon Ramsey come back for another episode of Kitchen Nightmares?"}
