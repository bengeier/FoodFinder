{"text":"Food poisoning after eating chicken dishes - A group of four went to eat lunch at the Rusty Rudder. Two of the four people ordered chicken dishes. A few hours after eating both people that ordered the chicken got very sick. We will never return to Rusty Rudder again after this experience. After being miserable for hours we looked up the North Carolina Public Health Inspection Scores. The Rusty Rudder recently received a score of a 91 and had violations including not properly storing foods to prevent contamination and items stored with date label exceeding 7 day hold time. We hope that by writing this review it will prevent others from getting sick. Hopefully management will evaluate their current methods for storing and preparing chicken and correct the problems so that others will not get sick. Going out to eat is usually an enjoyable experience, but the Rusty Rudder has made me think twice about eating out before checking the recent health inspection scores."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good most days, but not always. I like the crab cake sand which, which can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"The food in my opinion is well above average for bar food.  The bar seems to have a good selection and to serve good drinks.  The service is always friendly and always prompt.  The setting is beautiful.

What is there not to like?"}
{"text":"I have few good things to say about this restaurant.  The view and music were the only two things that made this outing acceptable, but I still cringe at the price I paid for the \"food\" and \"drinks.\" Margaritas had no alcohol in them yet they were the \"special\" of the night.  Save your money. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We went there for a Sunday afternoon. It was so nice sitting outside and enjoy live music. The place was very busy but we were able to find a table quickly. The service was quick. Food was delicious other than steak is no longer in the menu. I would bring my friends again."}
{"text":"Im sure there is a definite crowd for this venue. Though i shall not return. They have so-so service and a horrible beer selection. They played every Dave Matthews and Pearl Jam song imaginable. Great location though beautiful area by the lake."}
{"text":"I guess it was a pretty view...we were inside because the patio was slammed and then it began to rain hard.  Maybe have to try it at the lunch hour one day to enjoy the view.  The food was a bit expensive for the quality and quantity, but again this is mainly a bar so the food is not the main focus.  Although our server was very nice, we hardly saw her.  My husband and I were sharing a napkin, and one of our dinner companions asked for more iced tea and the waitress took the glass and finally returned about the time we were wrapping up to leave--essentially when she was bringing us the checks.  And one other notable that I found rather interesting.....um when did it become ok for dogs to be inside a restaurant (other than service dogs or outside on a patio).  I love animals so it didn't bother me per say,  but isn't that a health code violation having a dog literally running loose in the restaurant?"}
{"text":"Wife got food poisoning after eating at this restaurant. Called the General Manager and he did not seem to care. The rusty rudder got a sanitation grade of 91% in July due to issues of locating food in area that could be cross contaminated. If the manager has shown any remorse we would not be writing this review, but I can not let my wife's night of misery go without at least an apology. I hope this review will prevent someone else from getting sick and the rusty rudder will not get anymore people sick in the future."}
{"text":"Great to go by boat,awesome scenery, however the food, at least when we have gone is horrible! I mean I have it 2 stars because the scenery, and the music... is great! But the food is so disappointing we probably would be coming here often if the food was not so bad! I honestly don't recommend coming here, if you had to, get the wings, this might sound like an opinion and it is but you are better off just getting the wings."}
{"text":"Was recommended by some folks at the Marriott City Center Hotel.  

Glad went, great views, great service and the food was good.  Had good time chatting with all the fellow barflies and met the only two people in America to have visited \"south of the border\" in SC!

Ask the bartender Matt about his thrilling time hanging out with Pedro - he never \"sausage\" a good time (I-95 South of the Border billboard reference)

Recommend this place as the perfect spot to waste away a lazy afternoon....

We will return"}
{"text":"Don't get the chicken tenders. Tator tots are good tho and the burgers good. Beautiful view. Good drink specials all the time."}
{"text":"Rating is for a Monday night.  I got a seat outside with a half price frozen strawberry daiquiri.  It's busyish but not too loud.  The staff has been totally fine, no rudeness to report.  Lots of people are taking advantage of the crab legs special.  No one is being rowdy, just the mid level hum of tables of talking people.  I'm down with this, 4 stars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. I had the burger with fries today with non-sweet tea. All was good including the service and the bathroom!"}
{"text":"The view better than the chew!!! Stop at mc Donald's on the way and just have a drink here.the food served here is nothing more than short order food served by poorly trained servers!! This place would have closed up years ago if it weren't for the view.the chicken is chewy and tough as is the flounder. The amazing part is when our server asked if we could settle our check when we were less than half way through our lunch.this is a perfect example of an owner not caring about the quality of the food,just the."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful view great outdoor seating to enjoy. Service was very slow. One person ordered a drink before their food arrived and the drink was still not there when we were finished eating."}
{"text":"No dogs allowed. Also, they have to have that ridiculous little 18 year old rent-a-cop patrolling the docks to make sure no one from the shore boards your boat. If you have no pets and no friends expecting to get on your boat- you just can't beat this place. Seriously though- that little **** rent-a-cop might just be doing his job but he's a colossal a-hole."}
{"text":"We had been to the rudder a few times. Usually when we are out on the lake and we get hungry we will stop in for a bite. Back in May my in-laws where in town and we took them out in the boat and figured we would take them to Rusty Rudder for lunch. The food has never been excellent but good. And service was usually ok. But this time the service was horrible. Was told outside seating would be an hour wait so we sat inside. But five minutes after we sat down they were seating everyone outside. Waitress came to take our drink order and we ordered 2 appetizers as well. She brought out the drinks. 10, 20, 30 mins went by and still no appetizers. They were fairly busy so we didn't push the issue too much but not once did the waitress come over to tell us how long it would be or let us know what was going on, or to see if we needed refills. After about 40 mins we finally got her attention and asked what the deal was. She said she didn't know and would go check.  Really, how do you not know? I think she just forgot to put in the order or something. They finally came out about 10 mins later. 50 minutes for appetizers is ridiculous even if a restaurant is busy. We had been there before and just as busy and had our food within 20 mins. Food has gone down hill as well. I'm sure this place is ok if you want to drink with a water veiw. But we probably won't ever come back to eat."}
{"text":"Normally we love to come here but the last three times has sealed the deal. I will not return. Myself and some friends jumped in the boat and headed down around 8 on a Sunday after work. We were greeted with a rude waitress and a late night menu that was an absolute joke. When we asked to see the regular menu that we liked the waitress told us they were out of food. Instead of driving a half hour and waisting gas in the boat I'll just continue to drive to the blue parrot where I don't have to pay 12 bucks for mini corn dogs."}
{"text":"This is a bar on the Lake, not a high end restaurant.  As long as you are aware of this going in, the food and drink are good with great views.  The service has always been good for me and met my expectations."}
{"text":"The view was great! We don't mind bar food but the food here at RR was not good. Burgers only come Medium-Well and the BBQ sauce is really A1 sauce. The seafood platter was made of similar tasting items  but different shape pieces. The cocktail and tartar sauce were great!

Expecting bar food we didn't expect much but the service was brutal. Cute girls, but the timeliness of execution was rough!

We would only come back for drinks & view."}
{"text":"Drive your boat up to this lakeside hang out and go in and enjoy amazing drink specials while waiting to sit on the padio outside for good bar grub.  Come at night on the weekend to hear some great live bands too.   Did I mention they always have a drink or beer special?  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Update 10/7/12:
Being the cheap (and I don't mean price) lake bar in the area you have to have lower standards, but this place just keeps getting worse. This is a review of the last and final time I will be going to the rudder. 
My friends wanted to meet here, and wanted to sit at a table, much to my dismay (our waitress is obviously not employed not for her skill, but blonde hair and big boobs, I'll get to that soon). Upon sitting down our table top broke straight off the bottom, flinging drinks everywhere. None of the staff helped, we had to chase down bouncers and the waitress to get a new table (which we ended up having to get ourselves). They did replace the drinks for free, but it wouldn't have surprised me if we were charged for them anyways (to make things less complicated for our valiant server, we had put everything on one tab).
The bouncers had known about \"this table\" but never did anything about it, knowing it was on the verge of breaking, and apparently broke often.
So after this, the waitress brought over one friend's replacement drink and left. For 20 minutes. Upon returning she takes our drink order and leaves for minimally another 20 minutes. This is at like 9pm- the place is still empty. I finally get my dirty martini, which is solid olive juice. Because our waitress totally vanished again, we went up to the bar to get it fixed. The bartender mumbled something about the liquor meters, poured in ONE more shot to dilute the two terrible martinis, which slightly diluted the brine. Of course I make the mistake of asking the waitress for another later on, but asked if they could put in less olive juice. She was really confused, and had no clue that a martini is not a 1.5oz cocktail, neither did the bartender.  She told me if I wanted it made properly I would have to buy another shot. A terrible $14 absolut martini? So I went to the bar and got the same story from the bartender. Sorry you have metered pourers now, but dont make it my problem. After paying extra to make my 2nd drink drinkable at the bar, we left and will not return. 
SLOW service, the bartender can't make a martini to save his life, our table fell apart and they didn't care, our ditsy waitress stopped by our table four times in two hours, then giggled about how terrible the drinks were without offering to fix it, her only advice was to go up to the bar to buy more shots to fix it myself (this must usually work on men........I'm sure shes a nice girl, but cornelius is plagued with \"cute\" girls that likely can't spell their own name, let alone do their job). And I want to add, I love hot girls and boobs, just not when there isn't a brain buried somewhere inside.
Thanks for reminding me how crappy this bar has become, we used to spend a ton of money here. 

Original Review:
I LOVE this bar in the off season. 
The staff is attentive, older than highschool age, and actually cares you exist. In the summer.............good luck. Its annoying unless you're already drunk or don't care if anything happens in a timely manner.

Pretty much always $2 Buds & PBR, $3 Coronas and $5 gatorade shots. Random days might have another item, but these are always \"the special\".  The deck area has a great view of the lake, although the lower levels are all waitress seating, lame. It will take you 30 minutes to get a beer from a waitress.
The bartenders at the outside bar HATE you exist. They MIGHT put their cell phone down a couple minutes after you walk up (whether its busy or not). The \"live music\" is generally really bad. Like, really bad. Its 1/3 musician bad-comedy hour, 1/3 drunk band members begging the audience for shots, and 1/3 extremely loud drunk \"singing\".
Bottom line- its a totally different bar in the summer. As a cheap lake bar, it will attract the young jersey shore style boaters to plop off their boat to drink some more. Lucky for Lake Norman there's plenty of bars, so if you want something more civilized, hit somewhere else. Aside from the terrible wait staff, its exactly what you'd expect from an after boating."}
{"text":"So I have no clue what the food tastes like. However. I do know that this is a perfect place to grab a drink, sit on the patio enjoy the view of the lake (the little part that you can see) and relax. This is def an awesome chill spot. Good beer prices and always live music, at least when I have been here. Beers by the lake? Perfect"}
{"text":"The place is ok. The service is a little slow... And the outdoor seats get really hot. The menu is big but Make the food sound a lot better than they are. This place is ok usually good for casual dining."}
{"text":"The Rusty Rudder is a great place to go if you don't have a boat and want to enjoy the lake view.  Also they have live music outside to enhance the party.   Outside there is a bar, stage for the musicians and upper and lower patios for dining.  The inside has additional dining tables, another bar and pool tables. Sometimes we ait inside if the wait is too long because it is a nice way to cool down after being on the lake all day.

Their food is consistently average.  Not great but not terrible.  Just typical bar style food.  

It is excellent that at their fuel docks they provide 93 Octane Fuel, one of the few places on the lake to offer it.  They have 5 slips dedicated to fueling which keeps your wait time down.  However those five slips mean that there are five fewer to park in for dining and you can expect a long wait if they ate all occupied.  Additionally they sell beer, ice and snacks in the fuel dock store and have designated spots for jet ski parking."}
{"text":"Come to this place for the views not the food. French fries were frozen Ore-Ida, burger wasn't bad."}
{"text":"WE visited here for the first time yesterday.  Just loved it. Great view. Great food (had the salmon entree).  It was delicious and good size portions.  They even took extra care to be sure my meal was not placed next to shell fish in the kitchen.  I mentioned it to the waitress that I was allergic to shell fish and she and the kitchen made sure I was safe.  It is a great place. Our service was great......view was great, food was great. Not sure why others had bad experiences....ours was a great one."}
{"text":"The Rusty Rudder should be first and foremost considered a bar not a restaurant. No one comes here for the food they come here for cheap drink specials, live music with no cover charge, and to watch a hoard of drunk people congregate during the summer months. 

The best part of this place is that it is right on the lake, so you can arrive by car, boat, jet-ski, or arm floaties if you wanted to.  Like others have written, the crowds at this bar are of the lake trash variety, overly drunk women and meat heads, but millions of people have turned Jersey Shore into one of the most watched TV shows for a reason, these people know how to party and watching them do so is entertainment within itself. If you are looking for a quiet everyone knows your name type experience from this bar, then you should look elsewhere. 

Regarding the food, I will give it up to their appetizer selection, their Crusty Rudders are one of my favorite starters around. They are basically tiny delicious cheese and pepperoni calzones. Their buffalo chicken dip is good as well, they have fried pickles, and they also have \"tots\"! Decent bar food like others have said, but nothing impressive from a dinner out perspective. 

If you are young, wild, wearing a bathing suit, and looking to relive some lost spring break moments then this is about your only choice in town. Mix in a monthly dollar beer special, shots, their new Fishbowl (tastes like a pink starburst), and you can create some of your very own \"Norman Shore\" moments right here in Charlotte. 

P.S. Between October and April this place is deserted, strictly a summer spot!"}
{"text":"Good place to get a little view of the lake, although not an amazing view. Fried pickles and voodoo shrimp were both pretty good. Grilled chicken sandwich was kind of bad. Service was friendly but a bit slow."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. It will be the last. Got a table inside immediately. Outside was 30 minutes. It Took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order. And another ten for another waitress to ask if we've been helped. Ten minutes after that our drinks finally came after some apologizing about how they're not sure what happened. Ok. Fine. We place our food order. No appetizers. The waitress came by twice saying it should be out any minute. The third time she tells us the kitchen lost our order. The manager will come talk to us if we wanted. We were there over an Hour before we got our food. Manager never came to speak to us and nothing was taken off our bill. The food was ok. Typical bar food. We had mahi mahi tacos and a crab cake. Nothing special. The view wasn't that spectacular. The service was horrendous. Do not waste your time or your money. It could be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let's face it. You come here for the view...and maybe a bottled beer (hard to screw that up).

But if you are looking for decent food or mixed drinks that wow you, keep researching.

Weekend nights with music and tanked gals dancing a fool is great people watching. And I can say that because I have been said gal a time or two. But always regret it the next day :)"}
{"text":"The WORST food on the lake! We got some apps last night, and while they arrived fast on a crowded night, we could have eaten better at the Convenience store. Mini corn dogs are delivered to them frozen, so they couldn't really mess them up. But the artichoke dip and \"Crusty Rudders\" (pizza pinwheels) are dishes the owners should truly be ashamed of. The dip was bland and boring at best. The pizza rolls however, were downright disgusting. You get better food in an elementary school cafeteria. Unedible, even after we had been drinking their overpriced drinks for hours. At that point ANYTHING would normally taste good. Not the crap they served us though!  Blech!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the location and the lake view.  Food was just fair, admittedly it was Black Friday and we heard they got slammed at lunch but we got no tarter sauce or cocktail sauce with our meals, no Cole slaw was ever served. French fries were cold, shrimps seemed small. Great location, lots of TV's for sports inside, fair number of drink specials, just be aware food is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Called in a take out order; had it repeated on the phone and did not come out correct.  Unfortunately we had left the dock before we realized.  Food was ok, slaw was bad, definitely not worth the money.  We were  the order would be ready in 20-25 minutes and it took 55 minutes.  I am not sure I will be back.   The menu on Yelp is not their current menu :("}
{"text":"Food was very good, service quick. It had a great view of the water from the marina there and inside and outside dining/cocktails. Nice vib. Food tastes home made. I had fried shrimp in a light batter and ordered lobster mac and cheese which I recommend but it is very rich so order a side of it w your meal, yummy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the Shrimp Tacos!!! And TATER TOTS!!!! Cool place to eat coming off a boat. Definitely a chill place on the water. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I thought it was a cool place on the water.  Service was decent.  Location was ideal."}
{"text":"It isn't meant to be a fine dining destination. That being said it is a superb social observation opportunity. Excellent girl watching spot. Yes remarkable views abound. Come on, it's on the lake and that's where everyone wants to be when the weather is warm.

Food - wellll Wilbur... Artichoke dip is barely edible. The voodoo shrimp is a recommendable dish. Otherwise basic Sammie fare... They do pour a stiff drink! Finis!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the best thing about this place is the view. 

We went a few years ago around March and it was super loud and more of a dance party at night. 

This past time the weather was just starting to turn warm and we sat outside to enjoy the view.  Our waitress seemed on her A game at first, then one person in our party waited over 20 minutes for her diet coke before she was told they were actually out.  I had the shrimp tacos and there were about 4-5 TINY popcorn sized shrimp on each of my two tacos.  We upgraded $4 for the lobster mac and cheese as a side, which I think it pretty pricey for the hamburger helper tex mex mac and cheese that landed on out table..... with no visible lobster in it.  We had arrived slightly before noon on a Sunday and were waiting to order alcoholic beverages, once we noticed several tables around us already had theirs, we inquired with our waitress, she said it wasn't noon (when indeed it was).  She took our drink orders and disappeared for at least 10 minutes, by the time we finally got out drinks we were ready for our checks. 

This place has the best location a restaurant/bar in the area could ask for, hopefully they improve."}
{"text":"This place used to be a lot better than it is today. My wife ordered a salad with no onions, it came with onions and no dressing. Also, they're Bloody Mary tasted like ketchup. The only thing this place has is a decent view but it's not worth the bad service and overinflated prices"}
{"text":"What a view!
This spot is great for a long lunch or happy hour by the water. Nothing like escaping the work week with a lake side drink and dinner.

The food is decent, but the location is what keeps you coming back.

Great drink specials, occasional live music, almost always a friendly cougar double fisting a marg and a mich ultra."}
{"text":"We went for drinks on a sunny Tuesday afternoon in March. It wasn't very busy and the outdoor bartender was nice.  My beer (NoDa Woody & Wilcox IPA) was good, but my wife's Blue Moon tasted watered down and off. Almost like it was mixed with Bud Light or something. Not sure what was going on there. We enjoyed our time there though, and the beer thing may have been a fluke.  

The view was ok. Yes it was on the lake, but it wasn't a particularly nice spot on the lake. Kind of in a back corner, hidden. 

We will probably go back for beers sometime, maybe try the food, but the reviews are pretty terrible.  Eat at your own risk, but for a drink outside, not bad,

$3 Drafts on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"DINER BEWARE....this place charges for condiments!  .25 for honey mustard!  Ludicrous!! Such an insult!"}
{"text":"If you think this place has good food then you shouldn't be writing reviews on this site because it isn't even a matter of opinion, this place just stinks.  

The service is TERRIBLE....consistently , at varying days and times.  

The menu is limited. 

The drinks are ok, nothing special, and they are out of normal items frequently. 

I would be completely ashamed to own this place but the location is tremendous and there is no competition so they can get away with screwing people on the daily."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the new menu. Very small with no entrees. Waitress said it was to make tickets come out faster, but we still waited about an hour for are food two fried shrimps, and a chicken sandwich. Price of drinks doesn't off set the poor food. I'll be back for the music and outside patio, but recommend to eat at one of the other fine restaurants around the lake!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible staff. Why does it take so long to get a table when there are empty ones all over the place? 

I should never have to remind my server I ordered a beer, let alone remind them several times only to never get the beer in question. 

Crappy food, crappy location. Only for drunks who are already drunk when they get there. I still don't get why people bring their kids here, its not a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a restaurant looking over a beautiful lake.   Well Rusty Rudders is your place - park the boat right outside and grab a seat on the large deck. Grab some bar bites and a cold cocktail.  This place is packed during the summer so the service can be hit or miss but overall you will definitely enjoy the place and especially the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The place is dirty, smelly and unfortunately it is one of only a few choices that you can drink and eat on the lake. The staff is rude and ignorant and the bartenders are even worse. I would love to go there more to listen to live music but unfortunately their bouncers treat their patrons like like shit and treat the place like it's some kind of college bar. This could be a fabulous and fun casual bar on Lake Norman. This bar is mostly a 30 plus crowd but it is ran like Bar Charlotte. It's pretty sad that they don't know their own clientele and they don't know how to cater to the people in their market."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect argument in favor of competition.  They have a near monopoly as the lake-side bar.  We are new to the area and had our 3rd visit today.  The first two were just o.k.   This time we took a 40 min. boat ride thinking we'd have our coffee and breakfast.  Get this... Sunday morning, brunch day and all that... they are OUT OF COFFEE.  I thought the server was kidding at first.  What kind of restaurant runs out of coffee on a Sunday ?  But here's the real pi$$er... I know we will end up going back because when you're on the lake and you want to tie up, enjoy a beverage and maybe some live music, this is THE place.   If you go expect marginal food, a totally dispassionate staff some would call surly, and cocktails prepared in mass production. (I stick to beer if I order a drink).  But.. as others have said, the view is great and atmosphere festive."}
{"text":"There are few decent places you can go for good lakeside dining, drinking, and entertainment on Lake Norman, but generally, the Rudder is also one of my favorites in the area. I really do consider the establishment more of a hangout joint for drinks more than a place to eat, but I have also solely ate here on occasion. 

Drinks are modestly priced, and even on a weekend they usually have some kind of running special, which is always good. The food is ok. It's not bad in the least, but it's also not impressive. Most people can make dishes of equal quality at home with ingredients purchased from their local supermarket. Food cost is a little above what you would expect from the average bar food. As a majority of their dishes are seafood-based, and given its waterfront location, it seems justified.

Nothing compares to soaking in scenery of the lake here on a nice day. If you have a boat on Lake Norman, they usually have a few open boat slips to park the ol' vessel and drop in. They have a great deck, and even with adequate space it does still tend to fill up. 

As far as entertainment, they've had live bands most times I've gone on weekends. Service was great. My only complaint is the crowd. It really can be douchebag central here at times. Otherwise, great joint."}
{"text":"The view is great especially when it is a beautiful day outside. But that's the only thing I enjoyed. 

The food was HORRIBLE. i'm not even exaggerating it seriously looked bad tasted bad and was baaaaad going down. The only thing I can say was good were the drink specials, which is why it gets 2 stars.

Service was meh, wasn't busy and had to wait a while for things. But our server was very sweet so that was nice. 

There are other places around that I would rather grab a bit to eat, but it seems fun to come to with a bunch of friends at night to drink and hangout."}
{"text":"I hate this dump. The only nice thing about it is the large outdoor area, which is pretty nice and unique for a bar of this size. You can even drive your boat up and get some booze if you like.

I will say my experiences with the Rusty Rudder always came at night for the bar, so I can't really speak for the food or anything else. I generally hate the crowd that always comes here, and every time I've been someone always ended up getting in a fight (granted, it was often one of my friends, but still).

The drinks are overpriced and watered down. The bathroom is a complete mess. I think this place just needs an overhaul. They have one of the best spots on the lake, if they would just class it up it could be quite nice."}
{"text":"Insane daily drinks specials. Went there on a Saturday night and they had $1 Busch Lights, $2.75 Coronas and $5 Gatorade shooters. Took a look at the calendar and the deals varied by the day of the week. I wish I had an alcohol problem.

Venue-wise, a stage with a live band (props to the chick jamming with her fiddle - sadly I was like \"Yo, there's a chick on stage playing the violin!\" - it's a fiddle buddy. They also have a beer pong table but that didn't seem to generate much buzz. 

Bartenders are cool and fast. Always on top of getting someone a drink. They also have outdoor seating with multiple big screen tv's. Always a plus. I think the most impressive part was the fact that it's a boat dock where everyone just pulls in, docks, and gets their drink on. 

I think I was looking for Scuba Steve after drink number 6..."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go have drinks after work with my work friends and I usually love the water front dinning but this was not the case. The waitress took at least 10 minutes to come ask us for drink orders. We asked for the drink specials and were told it was $5 sky vodka you call it's and all of us ordered redbulls and vodkas. After 2 hours of slow service and being ignored we got our bills only to be charged $9 a drink. When we asked our waitress she rudely replied that we did not specifically ask for sky after being told the specials so she assumed house vodka. The staff was rude and slow and clearly didn't care about their customers. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is nothing special; it's just your typical bar.  The menu is simple with not too many options.  I scanned over the menu and decided to go with a Voodoo Ranch Wrap without the bacon and I got the fried shrimp option tossed in voodoo ranch sauce.  Inside the wrap it's the shrimp, shredded cheddar/jack cheeses, lettuce, tomato, and onion.  It's wrapped in a garlic herb tortilla.  I was looking through the sides and tater tots jumped out at me so I had to get some.  The food was delicious; I could have ordered another round and ate that as well.  The texture of the fried shrimp was just right with the flavor of the ranch was nothing like I have had anywhere else.  The shrimp couldn't have been cooked any better.  The tortilla was soft but it held everything in place while eating the wrap.  The tater tots were also cooked to perfection.  They were crisp and came out piping hot.  I had a great experience there and look to head back again.  I would recommend going there because the food is great and so is the service."}
{"text":"We've been for lunch on two occasions. The view of the lake always keeps us coming back! The food was fine. It met my expectation for lakeside bar cuisine. They are always quite busy, but we always seem to get a table quickly. No big bells and whistles on food or service, but I'm sure we will go back."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere.  The food is good but not great.  Its a fun place with a fabulous view."}
{"text":"Have been to this place many times. Location is just ideal for an extended noon to evening hangout with a group of friends during summer. Food has the normal pub menu, but the highlight is its location just beside lake Norman. 
Late night parties has live performances with an awesome crowd. 
Different settings altogether when compared with places in uptown or in urban Charlotte."}
{"text":"Local spot if you want to run into Local NASCAR driver there family's, friends, and fans... have seen members of the Earnhardt family having a good ol time on the back patio... it faces the Lake. you can dock the boat come up and have drinks, food, enjoy the atmosphere and then back to the boat is about 20 steps away..

I came to find this place while wondering around in the apartment complex next door... a one way fence lets you right in to the bar property.... however you will need a code to get back into the apartment complex.

Iv had the buffalo shrimp burger !!  it was Awesome


always opt for the sweat potato fries there way better then the plain ones


Cheers!"}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because of the location...awesome views. The food, however, was awful! We are very easy people to please. If someone tries hard and is apologetic when something goes wrong, we are very understanding. When people that come after you get their bill prior to you getting your disgusting food, then we have a problem. Crab cake sandwich ($13) had no taste at all. \"Fried clams\" (frozen clam strips) and flounder (big pile of mush) for $17...yuck! No mention of the 30+ minute wait for the nasty food when it was delivered. Waitress had only been there about 2 weeks so I don't really fault her. We have been here a handful of times and had great food and service. What happened???"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on July 4th....pretty crowded, but only about 1/2 hour wait....She-crab soup was fantastic, as was the burger my wife had and fish taco my cuz had....I got fried shrimp with slaw, the slaw was weak and kind of flat, shrimp were popcorn size....great waitress ans service though."}
{"text":"The food here was decent. I thought they served all sorts if seafood. I will say that it's nice to eat outside over looking the lake. I would best describe this place as a perfect place to go for lunch to grab a cold drink and done food."}
{"text":"We enjoy going here since we have a boat docked at the marina, HOWEVER, the last 2 times we've eaten here one of us has gotten sick.  If you stick with the fried seafood, you're probably OK, but avoid anything else.  Avoid the shrimp roll and ahi tuna wrap."}
{"text":"We decided to go to the Rudder today as my folks are visiting from Australia so we thought lunch on the lake would be great on this beautiful day.  However the food and service has AWFUL !!!!!!!  The only thing really edible were the deep fried pickles, we waited a hour for our food and it was all cold when we received it, even the bacon and eggs! I ordered the wings as my main, they brought them as a starter,I asked them to be cooked well done which they were not so I sent them back, 20 minutes later they bought them back dripping in oil and just disgusting, there was actually a thick layer of oil the bottom of the basket. They did comp the wings but $67 for a meal that was cold and disgusting I think is ridiculous! As for the service there really wasn't any, the waitress was so stressed out that should couldn't even think what customer service should be, I tipped her as I felt sorry for her, she seemed to be running around like a chicken without a head. The only things this place has going for it is the view but if my restaurants was serving food and had customer service like that I would take a serious look at my management staff! I've just started a business in the area and will definitely not be recommending the Rusty Rudder!"}
{"text":"The Rusty Rudder (or The Rudder, as it is known to most) is one of the most popular spots on the lake, especially during the summer.

This is largely due an enormous three-level patio that extends towards the lake and can accommodate a big crowd.

An outdoor bar allows those congregated outside to get drinks without going back inside.

Boat slips allow float-up access, and there is a small shack on the docks that sells ice and beer as well.

Inside, the Rudder is known as a pretty good live music venue. Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays are big here, and a recent renovation has opened up the interior a bit more.

There are plenty of flat-screen tvs for watching games and a pool table and video games for those interested in some friendly competition.

The food is pretty good, especially the burgers after a long day on the lake.

If you like your crowds big and your music loud, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Much Improved.

When we first moved to the Lake, this was one of our favorite places but that restaurant closed and the Rusty Rudder moved in and it went downhill.  Been awhile since we've been here but they have made big improvements in the cusine and service and it's close to what it used to be.  Music is still way too loud and you can't hear yourself think but other than that, not bad.

My wife and I went for brunch today after Church. The place was virtually empty the entire time we were here.  We were promptly seated at a table right next to a window with a great view. Of all of the restaurants accessable by boat, this one has one of the best views on the Lake. We were given the option of eating on the covered deck but considering we were having a cold wet rain, indoors was more cozy.

My wife ordered a Green Tomato, Crab Salad that she fell in love with. I opted for an Oyster Po Boy with Fries that was not bad even though the oysters were a bit overcooked.  Fries were excellent however.

All in all, not bad and a big improvement from the last time we were here. Now if they would just learn to cut down the music a bid, particulary if you only have a couple of patrons, it would have been a bit better. Another thing they could do is open up theri Wi-Fi to the patrons.  Theirs is secure and I ended up logging on with my own hot spot."}
{"text":"View great , wings not cooked  claims so so fish tacos very good only visit"}
{"text":"Bar food at best, but they try. I would give them 2 stars for food but they get an extra star for the location on the water. It is a must to sit outside and under the misters to cool you off. People watching is off the charts here and makes for a fun dining experience, especially when the drunk lake crowd comes in off the water. The bar is cool and they have live music some nights. Overall - this is one of the reasons I moved away from the lake and into uptown Charlotte - but sometimes a boy has to go back to his roots - ha ha."}
{"text":"The View is the only thing worth visiting here.  Poor service, attitudes of grandeur and Rambo want-a-bees for security.  Not to mention the whole food menu taste like it was cooked in the same greese fryer.  Gas for your boats is not the only gas you will get here.  Choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had good times sitting outside with my wife and daughter when we lived here. Back in town for business and was extremely underwhelmed. Bartender was a frat guy with a backwards hat and a \"what do you want\" attitude and was more interested in the waitresses than me. Got the cheesesteak which looked like it was effortlessly thrown together and they only put cheese on one half. Tasted very bland. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I shouldn't be too hard on the Rusty Rudder, but I will. It's a sports bar on Lake Norman that has live music. But it's more than that. Late at night it becomes a sort of dance club for all the people still lurking around the lake after a day of festivities. I ordered a bourbon on the rocks and the pour into the plastic translucent solo cup was generous. It's just not my scene. I prefer the quieter parts of Lake Norman late at night..."}
{"text":"The food lackluster, table felt like it was ready to collapse....
Ordered the blackened mahi...wasn't really blackened and all I could taste was the salt.
The worst thing in my opinion, we were seated outside at #112....6 people in the party...The table felt like it was ready to collapse. Looked under and saw the time tested fix of stuffing bar coasters everywhere possible.
When the server asked me what I wanted....I said \"a new table\".
Nothing makes me more angry then when a business is making good money and refuses to take care of the important things, like a table that rocks around when you're trying to stab your food.
NOT IMPRESSED...If you want alcohol and music, maybe...keep the \"restaurant\""}
{"text":"4 of us ventured out here on a Friday night. The wait was normal, about 35 minutes, we sat on the deck with a beautiful view of the lake. It took our waitress a while to come over. One of the people I was with wanted a  frozen strawberry margarita and the waitress told her that those drinks only come on the rocks. I could see the island oasis machines at the outdoor bar from my seat. Her drink was a hideous concoction when it came out. The crab dip appetizer followed and it was heavenly.  We actually ordered a second one. Then our waitress disappeared for 45 minutes.  All of our dinners came out cold.  I got soup...cold. My husbands quinoa entree....cold. Cousins pan seared scallops. ...not pan seared and cold. My other cousins clams....frozen strips....cold.  I also ordered a $7 side of lobster mac and cheese.  It was smaller than a ladle,  cold, loaded with PEPPERS and cheese less.  Salads we all ordered came out with the meals??? I asked for the bill and once again the waitress vanished.
My cousins have been here a few times and say it has changed a lot.  Bottom line....go for a few non frozen drinks and an appetizer. Save your money on the rest."}
{"text":"Ahh...the Rudder!  My summer home away from home!  Simply put...I love all that the Rudder has to offer.  Live music, great food, plentiful drinks, and a view of the best lake in the south east.  My comfort level is at an all time high when I am here.  Come by boat or car...which we do both.  Try the shrimp tacos with the amazing Voodoo Sauce and the Crusty Rudders are a must!"}
{"text":"While vacationing in the Lake Norman area, we decided to eat at the Rusty Rudder in Cornelius NC.  I write this review in the hopes of preventing someone else from making the same mistake.  Now I'm no Gordon Ramsay, but I feel that I have a pretty good grasp on what good food taste like.  My parents owned a successful restaurant growing up and I've eaten at great restaurants across the United States and abroad, including eating food from street vendors while serving in Afghanistan.    Afghanistan may have been the safer choice.  Clearly there is no chef working here.  The food consists of frozen fries, tator tots and Kraft Mac and Cheese.  We ordered the Lump Crab meat dip which tasted like a lump of cream cheese with the occasional crab particle being thoroughly overwhelmed by its under seasoned surroundings.  I ordered the lobster roll which tasted like celery.  Now to be fair, it did say it was served with mayo and diced celery, but I might as well have had just a stick of celery, since the poor lobster was overwhelmed by that flavor and sadly died for nothing.  Do not visit the online menu lest you be fooled by trick photography since the food looks nothing like it.  
On a positive note, the view is beautiful but you don't need to eat anything to appreciate it.  In fact, if you bulldozed the whole restaurant into the lake, the view would be just as nice and you would save yourself a $100 mistake for a family of five."}
{"text":"I almost didn't give this place a chance because of all the recent bad reviews.  I'm glad I did though.  It honestly wasn't bad at all.  

We went for lunch early on a Saturday afternoon.  We were seated right away at an outside table with an awesome view of the lake.

Our server was pleasant and attentive and kept our drinks filled.

I had the grilled chicken sandwich and I asked them to blacken it, which they did.  Could have used more spices, but it was good.

My husband had the she-crab soup, which he said was very good.

My son had the kid's cheeseburger and fries and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. He's 5 so his experience is limited, but he ate every bite of it, so it must have been good to him.

The only complaint I have is that they needed to change the oil in their fryer.  The fries were \"ok\" but they had a slight fishy taste to them and that unmistakeable taste of old frying oil.  That and the non-spicy chicken are really the only reasons I did not give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"We came specifically to see a touring band perform their only stop in the area, but seriously I don't know why the Rusty Rudder insists on having live music without taking care of the poor sound quality and engineering.  And they barely advertised or promoted the show at all.  It is not a music venue, and it's just an ok restaurant.  The fish tacos were pretty small and uneventful, while the bow-tie pasta was basically boiled pasta without any flavor whatsoever.  It's fun to be sightseeing on the lake, and of course that's the major draw here.  And occasionally coming to see Simplified play their acoustic set out in the Tiki Bar.  They've got that down pretty good."}
{"text":"Other reviews are pretty accurate. 

This is a lakeside bar with a great view, that kinda does food and music. It is good if you go in with that expectation, but not all that great if you are looking for a more. Food wasn't bad, but I would really only want to come here for a beer and break from the lake via a boat.

Had a nice cold beer, pretty decent fish tacos, and very odd sweet potato tots (don't bother)... 

Always a little disappointed when a place has such a great location and then loses focus. They could triple revenue with a little more effort."}
{"text":"Came by boat for lunch, good docking, not the best I have seen at a on the water restaurant though.  But that didn't take away from the experience. Good food options for anyone and everyone in my opinion.  I had the turkey burger and it was very good.  If you are on Lake Norman and are looking for a place to take the boat to, or a good lunch spot driving and want to eat on the water, I definitely recommend Rusty Rudder."}
{"text":"They do serve food. So that's not a lie. However, all the menu items look and read about 10x better than they actually are. If you prepare for mediocrity, the location, music and great TV setup makes your experience somewhat enjoyable. 

Overall? It doesn't suck."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and view, and when they have live music it's been pretty good. But.. Food portion is ridiculously small for the price. $17 for choose 2 seafood combo for 7 pieces of shrimp?? No thank you"}
{"text":"Charlotte's own version of Jersey Shore but with Lake Trash instead of guidos and guidettes.  

You have to know what you are getting into if you show up here:

 - Bad sanitation rating (95.5 this past Saturday)....results in scary mediocre bar food.  I got a salad with 'grilled' shrimp the size of quarters.  Bleh. 

 - Live band inside plus neighboring hillbillies and drunk lake trash equals chicks making out on the dance floor and then falling down

- Above average amount of girls throwing up in the can or on each other on the dock cause they have been drinking all day and they are teenagers

- Meat-heads jealous over their hoochies talking to other meat-heads.  sigh...watch out for the fists flying.

IF YOU CAN LAUGH ABOUT ALL OF THE ABOVE (and love people watching!!!) ...... then this is a place with a nice outdoor deck to meet your friends after boating.  Hopefully you catch it on a warm summer night when the kids are on good behavior.  It is better to come for lunch when things are calmer and try to order something that have low odds of giving you e-coli."}
{"text":"Nice bar right on the lake. I had the fish tacos. And they where right on par. I drove in off the road, but it looks like there was a boat dock if you want to to get something coming from the lake side."}
{"text":"I was on the brink of 2 and 3 stars and our disinterested waitress tipped the scale to 2. One of the best things of this restaurant, and probably the reason that they are still in business, is the location and view. You can't beat a patio that looks over a beautiful lake on a beautiful day. That being said, don't expect the quality of the food or service to match the quality of its scenery. We got the nachos with chili to share. I've had better nachos at Taco Bell. I also got the rudder fish tacos which were less than thrilling. They didn't have a drink list available and the beers our waitress could list were nothing too exciting (I think I am spoiled by having such a great selection in Cleveland!). All in all, I would only go here again if I was super drunk so I wouldn't care what the food tasted like but still get the lakefront view."}
{"text":"New to the Charlotte area and stumbled upon this place. Awesome view of Lake Norman, cool, live music, great food and affordable, too! I highly recommend Rusty Rudder's! = )"}
{"text":"The Rusty Rudder is a bar with a great view of Lake Norman. There is also a drive up marina. These are the good things. The beer selection is very limited and the food is basically  quick fried bar food that isn't very good. The view is the attraction."}
{"text":"Get the buffalo chicken dip! It's the best I've ever had! And make sure to snag a table by the lake."}
{"text":"The Rudder is one of the best Bar/Restaurants on the Lake.  Food is usually pretty good and the drinks are too.  Nice outside patio area and you can even come in on a boat.  Of course Tuesday nights are the best."}
{"text":"Ok, i know its a dive bar on the lake, but I really liked it. 

Food is typical bar food. We had sweet thai chili wings that were a good price for 10 large, tasty wings. 

More importantly, the daily drink specials are really great (and they do them all day). When you first walk in, the board on your left lets you know what the special is depending on the day of the week. I recommend sitting out on the deck where you can look out at the water and the boats that are coming in and out of the marina. Service was prompt and friendly, restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Rudder I have a great time. You can't beat the location, the drinks, or the menu prices. I always try to arrive early on busy nights so I can get a seat at the bar. The bartenders are the bomb!! They are attentive and always suggest things my friends and I will like. Beers are always cold and they always ask me if I need another before I have to ask. I can't wait until the outside bar opens so I can  sit outside with our regular bartender Mary. You can't beat the service and the view in the summer time!! Keep it up Rudder, I promise we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"As stated by others, the view is the only good thing about the Rusty Rudder.  Well, I guess I can't really say anything about the food, I never got asked if I even wanted water.  

My husband and I walked in on Thursday night, a warm, but beautiful night, so not suprised it was a bit busy - not packed, busy.  We walked up to the hostess stand, looked right at both hostesses standing there, we were ignored.  Then a family of 5 came in from the deck and were seated immediately outside.  When they asked us, finally, if we wanted inside or outside, we replied outside and were told we would be waiting 35 minutes.  Ok, inside it is.  We were sat in a corner by the window, good table, other tables occupied around us.  

Once we sat down, it became obvious that there were table in the outside bar available, but we were never offered to check those out. 

We never saw a waitress, except the ones asking ALL the tables around us how they were doing, wanted more drinks, serving them food.  After 15 minutes we got up and left.  My normally very patient husband told one of the hostesses (who are not recognizable from customers) they we were never served and we were leaving, the response was \"ok, have a nice evening\"

Not going back."}
{"text":"Great spot on the lake. Simple menu but great drinking spot three tier deck with seating and an outdoor bar with live music. Fun crowd and good service. Worth checking out"}
{"text":"We came here because we did not know better!! Here comes the haterade..... 

People: Lake Trash, possibly b/c you can boat right up. Our waiter was a younger, trashier version of a hooters girl
Food: Horrid, one dish was worse than the next. The fried food tasted like the oil was bad. We had a large group (8) and everyone complained about their food, 2 sent it back 
Drinks: Possibly the only reason to go here is the drink specials, with that said -the mixed drinks are majorly watered down, the quality of well alcohol is along the lines of popov, the only thing to order here to be safe would be a beer. 
Music: We caught the beginning of a  Live band inside w/tatted up hillbillies and drunk girls dancing and failing on the floor (pretty funny) 
View: Nice view of the lake

Favor: Do yourself a favor and look on yelp for a place in NC worth going, there are several w/Lake views, w/Drink specials, w/edible food!"}
{"text":"This place has a great view of the marina and of Lake Norman, however the food is disappointing in a number of ways. We ordered the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos, both were not only really bad tasting but they barely had any fish or shrimp in them! I actually had to ask the waitress if the portion I had received was normal or if they forgot to add the fish. They brought me another order, equally anemic, but by that time I had realised how terrible the food actually was and couldn't bring myself to eat. If you do end up here I would stick with something simple like a turkey club, etc.; a dish the kitchen wouldn't have to put much thought into. Otherwise just stick with the view and drinks."}
{"text":"The lake view is the only reason I'm giving this place one star, and also the reason you can't give 0 stars.

Luckily, we snagged at table right by the lake which was the only positive with my first experience at rusty rudders. The service was terrible from the beginning to the end...the waitress only took 2 people out of the 7 people appetizer orders so we were confused to begin with why she didn't go around the whole table. 
Then when the food came, we realized that one of the meals were messed up, I wanted blackened shrimp instead of fried shrimp. Whatever, that's fine they fixed it quickly by just throwing the blackened shrimp just on top of everything. Then, we realized one of the meals was missing, the kitchen forgot to make that dish. So we had one person without a meal for 20 minutes while everyone got there's. When my friend's meal came out, she had specifically ordered without tomatoes since she can't eat them. It came out with TOMATOES, shocker. But the more ridiculous part was that she sent it back to get it without tomatoes, they brought it back out WITH THE TOMATOES. Wow.....seriously?! She didn't even say anything the second time around because the service already shows how much they care about their customers. 

The food there was ok, for bar food. The shrimp and lobster bisque sounds good, but is actually inedible! Save your $7. You would think a restaurant by the lake would have some decent seafood..boy was I wrong. The only thing worth mentioning to order were the sweet potato puffs. Everything else Sucks with a capital S! Clam strips were basically just breading. Very disappointing. When we called for the bill, my friend told the waitress that they forgot to take our the tomatoes again. No discount no nothing, she had to speak to the manager. Terrible terrible terrrible service.

Now...it's a bar right? You would think there drinks would be better to make up for the food. Yes, they have really good specials everyday even for the weekends. The drinks (except the beer) were all watered down!!!!! I didn't even feel a buzz. MORE DEPRESSING since my food sucked. The only thing to get is beer since you know they can't jip you off the alcohol there. They DO have great beer specials.

The place gets packed....there are a lot of drunk folks. The bar was on top of our table, and there was a guy threatening to throw his beer bottle on the table. We told the waitress...nothing was done. OBVIOUSLY.

I could go on and on about how horrendous my first experience here was. It gets packed...really packed which I don't get!!!!!!!!! Lucky for them they have prime location."}
{"text":"it's within 5 mins drive from the hotel i was staying... and we needed a place with some alcohol to hang out.. so i came to yelp and found this place.  

a bar on the lake... live band (country music - big plus!!!!)... $4/ea beer... what more can you ask for????? loved it!!!"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing dinner, fried green tomato & crab cake salad and the special, homemade meatloaf!  Amazing  service, Bre was amazing! Not to mention the view! We will defiantly be back again and again.
Steven the manager and the new chef Antonio even came to visit our table."}
{"text":"You go here for the view. Yes, the lake scene is gorgeous. However, don't forget the other entertaining sight to take in here: people watching.

This is my go-to spot if I'm in the Lake Norman area. If you're on the lake and need to grab grub, this place serves its purpose. They have a big menu. Everything is okay. Like Ryan G said, I think of this more as a place to drink than eat.

That being said... The Rudder always has great drink specials. The patio area is huge and full of energy. I love to come spend an afternoon here. There's usually live music. All the employees are super nice. Don't have a boat? Who cares! Watercraft is not needed to come have some fun.

Boat peeps- you can not use this as a place to go scoop people. If people are meeting you there, tie up the boat... go in and get drinks. But, be responsible! Police pull people over by land and water around this place. 

I don't have kids, but if I did i wouldn't bring them up here on the weekends during the Summer. There are a lot of drunk people. May not want them to see or hear some of the things that happen. For the adults though, sit back and enjoy the show."}
{"text":"Crap....dirty restaurant and poor service and subpar food.  And yes in July in the heat of the summer the air conditioning was out."}
{"text":"Okay, let me break this down.
I had heard this is a great place to sit down and have a couple drinks, I go into this place knowing that it is NOT restaurant quality. So I thought coming here after dinner for a few drinks one night would be a perfect end to my friends birthday. She works a lot and doesn't get out much, so I thought it would be great to sit by the lake and just have a fun time!
First, I get to the hostess stand and are listening to them flirt with the group of guys with beers in their hands for about 5 minutes before they get to us. Then, they tell us there will be about a 30 minute wait for a table outside. They don't show us the bar area, or much less crazy bar area outside (which I later noticed) for us to wait. So after trying to get drinks at the bar for about 10 minutes we gave up, because it was way to crazy in that small area and impossible to get the bartenders attention.
So after we are sat at our dirty table outside (that had a huge spider web on it), we have yet to get a drink menu. And don't see our waitress until about 15 minutes after sitting down. So then we explain to the waitress it's our friends birthday and we just want to have a few drinks and maybe a couple appetizers. So then she takes our drink order and continues to walk off before we told her the appetizers we wanted.
After another 10 minutes we FINALLY got our drinks and ordered a basket of fried pickles and another round of drinks since we knew we probably weren't going to see our waitress for another extended period of time. After finishing our appetizer and drinks, we are sitting there for about 20 minutes without food or drink or anyone asking us if we needed anything. And our waitress is no where to be found.
We decided that wanted another round of drinks and another appetizer when all the sudden the waitress runs up and puts THE CHECK on the table, basically shooing us out. Never asked if we wanted anymore drinks or food, it was horrible. So we just paid and left. I'll never go back there again. It's a shame because it's a great location for an upscale restaurant/bar but this one is TRASH."}
{"text":"A bit above the normal bar food, service was good...will go back.

Had the fish tacos, not the best I have had but worth having again."}
{"text":"Not bad for bar food!  We went on a weeknight when the place was practically empty, so service was really good.

When we told our server we had never been there before, she offered a few helpful suggestions, and all of them were spot on.  The Voodoo Shrimp was tasty, and the blackened shrimp and fish tacos were delicious. The only improvement I would suggest would be to use fresher flour tortillas, or offer fresh corn tortillas as a substitute. The fries were very good - they were skinny and crispy, and topped with salt and pepper. Yum!

All in all, we were pleased with our meal and will likely return."}
{"text":"4 for the ambiance.  visiting the in laws and boated here.  got there early on friday morning right when it opened at 11 am.  when we left around 12pm the dock slips were full.  service staff dressed like hooters girls, but way more attentive.  service was pretty darn good; she always came back to check on us.

3 for the food.  got the fried pickles ($8).  oddly sweet cornmealy batter (super hot and crispy).  the in laws loved it.  i'm impartial to pickles.  got the mahi mahi fish tacos and hubby got the buffalo shrimp tacos.  i asked what the fish tacos were (tilapia..which didn't justify the same price as mahi mahi, around $10).  fish tacos in some pineapple salsa.  it was ok..not something to write home about.  the buffalo shrimp tacos were a little better...nice crunch and bite to it with med shrimps fried and tossed in buffalo sauce.  choice of side included tater tots (tasted a lot like the oil fish was fried in) but sweet potato fries were nicely battered and crunchy.  oh yeah, miller high life was $1/bottle.  

will i go here again.....probably.  will i order the fish tacos, probably not."}
{"text":"As much as we crave waterfront dining, and continue to go to Rusty Rudder, each time we are generally disappointed with the food. First time had fish tacos with the weirdest after taste i couldnt even finish them. Went again and had a chicken wrap and it was literally so dry, not an ounce of sauce of any kind, i had to order ranch on the side to put in it. Fries were burnt. Does anyone that works there taste the food on the menu? If so, it would be so easy to fix with a little feedback from diners or even employees. Others in our party were equally dismayed. such a wasted oppy- hire a good chef with a totally new menu and you will have a goldmine."}
{"text":"We were referred to this spot for a Friday lunch on a hot spring day. It was absolutely ideal. Cold beer, fried haddock with lime, shrimp tacos. A nice view of the small marina. Ducks were walking up on the patio. Servers were very kind. 

Fries could use some creativity as the were bland."}
{"text":"Was at the Rudder today for lunch, party of 8. I am from out of state and was soooo looking forward to visiting. I loved my past few visits. This visit was not so great.  1/2 off frozen drinks on Mondays and ALL your frozen drink machines were broken?  What about kids menus? Nope never got those. The booth that we sat in was dirty as well as the windows and doors, while 5 employees sat around on their phones.  However, our waitress Madison was very attentive. 
Sorry to say but we will now be frequenting The Blue Parrot on our visits to the Lake."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on Sunday early spring  so I imagine that the atmosphere is different at night or in the summer. Anyhow the 4stars is largely for the view. Sat on the deck over looking the lake.I don't imagine that I would sit inside -- looked a little dark and dingy in there. Bathrooms were remodeled looks like - granite looking countertops. Nice drink specials but can't say how they were as I didn't drink  . Had fish tacos which were tasty . Frenchfries were thick cutand good. Good grits. Service was okay."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place on the lake . I've been here over 25 times in the past 2 years. They have recently changed there menu and it was very disappointing. They did not have any entrees and they said it was to speed things up and the service was still very slow. Please change back to your old menu! Awesome restaurant, horrible menu."}
{"text":"I've been a Rudder regular for years. Great place to watch live music, enjoy an amazing view, and sit at the outside Tiki Bar. They made some awesome improvements with an inside remodel, new menu, new chef, and probably 20 new TVs. Me and my boyfriend love to come here for football now too with their $4 Bloody Mary bar. Highly recommend if you're looking for a casual bar & grille to meet tons of new people, have a blast, & enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"Nice place, one of the few on the lake, beautiful at sunset. Live music is always fun but a but too many drunk folks stumbling by (outside tiki bar) during dinner hours. Good food, drinks and service. Skip the lobster Mac and cheese but go for the fried haddock. Oh and reservations for parties 6+ only but it was a quick wait."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in years.  Had some family in town, and it was a beautiful night so we went out to the Rudder.  Sit outside, you wont find a better view!  Their food is what I remembered. Not great but not terrible.  Just typical bar style food.  Plenty of room out on the deck for groups.  We had out 6week old with us.  Not bad to take him with us during the \"off-season\", however I wouldnt recommend taking kids during the summer."}
{"text":"The scenery was nice, the food not so much. Everything from my Sprite to my grilled chicken sandwich was not very satisfying. Wouldn't recommend it except for drinks maybe."}
{"text":"This place has become an absolute joke. The food is absolutely horrible. The Chefs just seem to put together random food and send it out when it is not what was stated on the menu. This has happened twice now, the first time the manager stated they ran out of the correct toppings and just threw random toppings on instead...umm you can't do that!! Today my crab cake salad was completely changed with no warning on the menu, had to send it back and the still came out wrong again. Manager rolled his eyes as he was walking away, oh I'm sorry the food isn't being made correctly! That was my favorite thing on the menu and it's apparently changing soon. I still enjoy the view but will probably only be back for drinks in the future, this is the third time in a row with inconsistant and bad food."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday evening to see Simplified acoustic.
It was a beautiful evening sitting outside on the deck by the water.

We had the crab dip appetizer...it was OK.
They had pint sized Blue Moon draught for $2.50...very nice.

I had the Mahi tacos, two filled with grilled mahi in a flour tortilla with a pineapple
and chipotle sauce;It was very tasty.

Lauren could have been a hooter girl...she took real good care of us.

The acoustics were fine for just the two gus from Simplified; they put on a great
show for NO cover."}
{"text":"Waste of BEAUTIFUL space right on Lake Norman.  It's 1 star in all respects save the view.  It's just so sad to know that they parlay that view into a semi-successful place where the kitchen and management don't really even try cause they know they don't have to.  

With a little investment, new management and a chef who knew/cared about what they were doing, this place could be a goldmine and a real destination.  A treasure for the Lake Norman area to embrace.  However...."}
