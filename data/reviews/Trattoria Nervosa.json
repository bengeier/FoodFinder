{"text":"The ONLY thing I found phenomenal about this place was the service. Our server was so attentive, friendly, charming, patient, and knowledgeable. Service deserves 5stars. I'm extremelyyyy seat picky. I don't know why, but I'm very uncomfortable sitting just an arm's reach away from people of another party. Eating should happen in a comfortable setting...the seating here is terrible, everyone is sort of bunched up together to the point where I could see the fine wrinkles in detail of the couple that was sitting 4 tables away from us, and somewhat hear the conversation they were having. I'd come back here maybe for the cuisine. They have great food, I won't deny them of that. (It's nothing extraordinary, mind you...but it's still delicious!!)"}
{"text":"I went for the very first time last week and I love the design of the place. Upstairs patio is very cute, and our waiter was so nice and friendly. The environment was great also. I ended up getting my pasta customized so it wasn't on my menu and I actually didn't end up liking it that much. I found it to be very average tasting pasta and my chicken was a bit dry. My friend however said her meal was delicious, so I won't mind coming back here for another try but I just didn't haven't a great first experience here."}
{"text":"Cafe Nervosa is the fast food version of dining in Yorkville. Don't get me wrong here I mean that literally. It is FAST. They usher you in, and get you out faster than a celebrity at Ultra, but that is what I expect when I eat here. The tables on the patio are extremely close together it may as well be a communal dinner table, but I kinda dig that! (make a note here folks.. the business that you are spilling to your friend just got a lot more public so ammend where needed!)

I've had both pasta here and the pizza. Both are decent! 
Perfect for a post mani/pedi lunch or a pre-movie dinner.
If you are looking for something unpretentious in Yorkville, wih the price point to match.. go. Would I go if I wasn't in the area? Probably not, but there are just too many restaurants to try now aren't there??"}
{"text":"Trattoria Nervosa is tucked away in Yorkville, Toronto right across from Anthropologie. I believe the restaurant has a sister named Gusto 101 on King St. West, which is another hot restaurant popular among the local. Trattoria Nervosa is much smaller in size with tables on first and second floors for customers. It has an open kitchen and a set menu that we makes us come back for more.

The restaurant's house bread is given after we order, which always takes awhile. The entire menu is available online on their website. It consists of daily specials, appetizers, salads (some have half portions, so ask your server), pastas, and pizzas. In addition, Trattoria Nervosa also sells their in-house olive oil which is amazing! With origins in Abruzzo, it is so full of flavour and smooth, it makes me want to buy a bottle every time.

As much as hubby and I want to order a salad, appetizer, and pasta, we usually order just pasta because the portions are huge. Seen from other customers, the salads look very appetizing and scrumptious. We asked our server if they served them in half portions, and we were delighted to hear that they served their arugula salad (Rucola) by halves. The other salads were unfortunately not served in half portions.

Rigatoni al Pomodoro:
It is a basic Italian pasta with tomatoes (pomodoro). It was full of flavour and left me wanting more. In North America, I find that it is sometimes difficult to find a true tomato pasta, as many restaurants serve meat sauce (with tomatoes) than just tomato sauce. I was happy to see Trattoria Nervosa serving this and really enjoyed my dish.

Mafalde di funghi:
This is a favourite between both of us, and so one of us usually orders it (usually hubs). This pasta uses numerous mushrooms with truffle paste and light cream, giving it a very rich texture. Our taste buds immediately light up and go into celebratory mode as we eat this pasta. We always order pasta with truffle paste when available. This was our wish come true. Aside from the truffle paste, the portion is huge, which is always a great plus.

Agnolotti di zucca:
I wanted to try something new, and I was pleasantly surprised with how good this dish was! What really drove home was the browned butter and the pumpkin paste. I mean, it couldn't have tasted any better. The kick of sage pulled it all together, leaving your mouth full of so many flavours to digest. This dish definitely tops one of my favourite pasta dishes of all time, and I would for sure order it again. I am a huge fan of foods that use pumpkin, and as I have never seen pumpkin and ravioli coupled together, this was indeed a refreshing combination.

The restaurant holds private functions and also honours takeout food through the maegen app.

If you're on the fence about the restaurant, we would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Slow service, at time felt like they forgot about us, 
Arugula salad was good, well dressed, 
Pasta with sun dried tomatoes - really average, the sauce tasted like it came from the can, 
others ordered pasta with seafood- also average, not too much sauce, and not too much seafood
Overall, I dont think it is worth coming back, although the location is good"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch on a sunny day when you're quite hungry. I suggest ordering a pizza because I believe it's their specialty and they're filling and not too expensive. When you're done, hop over to the gelato shop just next door to complete your Italian dining experience!"}
{"text":"Went to eclectic little Cafe Nervosa on a Thursday evening close to 7 hoping to miss the post-work rush and the dinner crowd; no luck. The place was happily buzzing with  conversation, laughter, delicious aromas and wine blushing faces. While there was a short wait (10 minutes) we were led to the bar to order drinks as we wait.

Atmosphere: 4/5. The place is beautifully decorated, the perfect blend of clean lines, natural light, art, tasteful cushions and crisp linens. The patios are gorgeous, we sat on the upstairs balcony. While the tables looked to be tightly packed, once seated, we had no problem keeping our conversation going and not rubbing elbows or eavesdropping on our neighbours. I took a point off because the indoor space is very tight and crowded and the hallways and walking space is narrow enough that while we waited to be seated we had to shuffle sideways and outside and against the wall constantly to let patrons and servers pass. The crowd was mixed, you will see: a lot of older sophisticated diners who were hob nobbing with the staff and appeared to be regulars. A lot of younger couples on dates. Lots of post-work yuppies. Some groups of girlfriends catching up over appetizers and drinks. You will fit right in wearing jeans and a tshirt as you will in a dress and heels. 

Service: 3/5. Previous reviewers mentioned that servers were scarce and they had to do everything but stand on their chair and juggle their cutlery to get their servers attention - we however had the opposite problem. We seemed to have 2 servers (odd, I know), got our menus by one, served our wine by another. Once the drinks arrived we were deep in conversation and were interrupted a handful of times by the server asking if we were ready to order or not. This theme continued through the dinner with constant appearances by our servers asking if they could get us anything else. While I appreciate attentiveness in servers this was a bit much. We had trouble carrying out a full conversation. On the flip side we felt bad for turning him away every time so ended up ordering a lot of glasses of wine - win win?

Food: 4/5. All in all a delicious meal. My companion had the Fettuccine ai Funghi and loved it. I ordered the Primavera pizza which I had read great things about and enjoyed it. Perfect vegetable : cheese ratio. Lost a point for the crust being impossibly thin. So much so, that I couldn't possibly hold it and had to resort to the pretentious fork-knife pizza method. Food came out hot and fresh, in a timely manner. We were not offered fresh pepper or parmesan, which was strange but didn't bog me down.

Value 5/5. Excellent prices for not only the area but especially for the quality and atmosphere. Nervosa could give their food a $3 hike per item and still have patrons shelling out the extra cash. 

All in all a winner. I will definitely be coming back. Great for good conversation and delicious meals."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The service and the food was great! I had the kale & sweet potato pizza and it was so big that you can share it. 

It was lunch time around the holidays, it was super busy and noisy. I'm not sure if that is normally what it's like. I was in a business meeting so it was difficult to hear. The next time, I'll try going with friends. 

**go for the food and expect it to be busy**"}
{"text":"The pasta and pizza are delicious .. Great selection of wine and always busy! They need to sign up for open table mind you, I hate waiting in line ..very yummy and affordable."}
{"text":"Really tight seating. Carpaccio was excellent. Short Rib Risotto was cold, I should've sent it back. Server was efficient, he liked filling wine glasses up after every sip, I found that annoying. Overall not for me, but I can see why people might like it."}
{"text":"Nervosa's dependable if you're not sure where to go in Yorkville, and not expecting too much. The pizza is delicious (thin-crust, whole-wheat option), and the salads are great. The main dishes are ok, pretty hit or miss. Some pasta is good (linguini w/ mushrooms) while other dishes not so much.  The service is sometimes slow, but it's just one of those places. They have a great patio upstairs and outside which is one of its saving graces."}
{"text":"My friends just took me here on a recent weekday evening to celebrate my birthday.  I have been here many-a-time and agree with others that it is a good go-to place.  But you need to get there early if you want a spot on either patio!  This place is full of Yorkville-philes and I admit that while we waited for a table upstairs, we had plenty of people watching to keep ourselves amused.  So much botox, peeled faces, diamonds and mini-dogs in shoulder bags walking past!

If you can get a table on the upstairs patio, that's the best spot.  Especially the table in the far corner against the wall.  There are plenty of burlap wrapped outdoor pillows to recline on.

The food is good.  I had a pizza with rosemary and thin sliced potatoes that was really bland, by my friends enjoyed their pasta dishes.  I had a few glasses of chianti which made the meal that much more enjoyable.  Our waiter was not very friendly, and I actually recognize him from all the years I have been eating here.  He was just as unfriendly as I remember him being.  He offered parmesean and pepper to my friends and just walked away when I said, \"I'll have some.\"

Overall I do like it here, but it's fairly standard, slightly overpriced Italian food.  Yes I will go here again.  Maybe for a different pizza."}
{"text":"Not sure why Nervosa has a low rating, but this place pasta and pizzas are awesome. 

After a day of shopping or having dinner here after work, with a great patio - can't ask for more and it's Yorkville! 

Portions are big and decently priced here, if you haven't eaten here yet, you should go."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch and ate downstairs - really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. The olive oil is light and amazing, great bread. My husband and I split a salad and pizza - while I was expecting the pizza to be much larger for the price (I could have easily eaten one myself) it was absolutely delicious. We ordered the margherita Regina and it had a sweet taste to the sauce, very appetizing. 

Glad we stopped in here, expensive but tasty pizza."}
{"text":"The service here is appalling; save yourself the experience.

We were sat during a busy but not overwhelming lunch service. Our server did not look at us even once. For 20 minutes, we watched her serve the tables on either side of us, without ever acknowledging us. Although all three were all sat within minutes of each other, both tables on either side of us received water, wine, bread, and had ordered food while we struggled to get our server's--or anyone's--attention. After 20 minutes, we gave up and walked to Sassafraz, for their reliably excellent service."}
{"text":"I went to this place mid June with a friend and the place was completely packed. Usually I take it as a good sign that when a place has lots of customers, there is a reason for that. So I was a little disappointed at the quality of food that was served. I had the daily special of Arctic char. The half the fish was cooked right but the other half overcooked. The presentation of the food was somewhat strange with the two pieces of fish stacked on top of each other. Anyhow, it was really the bean base that made me give this low rating. There was hardly any flavor to it and it was dry. My friend had a pasta dish, and again, the food was edible but for a restaurant in such a nice district, we expected a lot better. It was something that could have been whipped up by a college student rather than a trained chef. 
On the other hand, this was my first time there and I have not tried their pizza and numerous other dishes, so by chance we may have stumbled on two of their worst dishes but I doubt I'd go there again. 
The atmosphere and crowd is nice. It looked like fairly upper middle class crowd. The location is good but perhaps location rather than the food was the reason it was so packed."}
{"text":"The restaurant was ritzy chic. The fetucinni al funghi arrived with strands cooked clumped together and bland of taste. My friend and I had to add pepper to make the meal bearable. 

To make matters worst, dishes were cleared right after our forks rested on the half finished dishes and the remaining half glass of wine whisked away to be replaced with the cheque. not that we asked for the bill. We were severely disappointed by the quality and service. 

hustled out of a pleasant evening we left never looking back."}
{"text":"Nice location for the obvious reasons. Tried risotto nervosa and fettuccine funghi, both were great. Was more a fan of fettucine, and it's a lovely little place. Looking forward to it again, especially during summer, want to try out the patio."}
{"text":"The food was 3.5/5 but service is nonexistent. My 2 friends arrived and were seated for about 10 mins before I arrived. There was a small lineup by the time I got there. I wanted to speak with the lady at the front but she was in the middle of telling off 2 customers (I'm appalled by the way she handled the situation). Excellent first impression at the door, right? After the pissed off customers left, I carried on telling her I have two friends that are seated inside. She rudely asks for how many people I am with. My friends, who were seated right at the entrance behind the curtains heard me speaking to the girl and got me. Was she thinking I was going to grab an empty table or something? 
The servers never came by with more water or ask how we were doing, took our plates as soon as we finished and might as well just threw us the bills. The server hovered right over my shoulder as I was paying. There wasn't a lineup at this point but still felt super rushed by the servers. Absolutely unimpressed with the service. 

I ordered the shrimp pasta (3/5)- the shrimp was cooked well but the pasta was undercooked. My friends lasagna was good though (4/5). As much as I like the atmosphere and would like to come again for the patio and try other dishes, I don't think the 'okay' food can justify the terrible service I'd have to put up with."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great, the food is amazing, and the prices are reasonable. The octopus is so, so good--the best in the city, in my opinion. The servers are so courteous and sweet (despite Yorkville!). Please never change anything :)"}
{"text":"After a day of shopping in Yorkville, we stumbled upon Cafe Nervosa.  Am I glad we did!  We had the opportunity to sit on the rooftop patio and enjoy the beautiful weather!  We started off with the pan seared scallops (Capesante) and the steak salad(Tigliata di Manzo).  Both were a great start to dinner!  Since I was so indecisive, I just ordered the same entree as my wife, plus I was in the mood for pasta anyways.  We both had the Fettuccini alla Bolognese, while her sister had the rapini (Orecchiette Alla Barese)    It was delicious!  It brought me back to Rome or my friends Italian grandmother's table.  We finished our meal with the Semifreedo,  it was perfect! The service was friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere was bright and relaxed.   Next time we are in the Yorkville area and in the mood for Italian, we are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that the food at Nervosa is mostly fantastic. But no one goes to a restaurant just for the food. Service and atmosphere are also important. 

That's where this review comes in. I'm a regular at Nervosa and mostly I've had good experiences there. But the last time I was there something transpired that is too extreme to leave unmentioned. 

My boyfriend and I were dining early in the evening last Monday when we witnessed a family treated very rudely by one of the management staff. For no apparent reason this female manager insisted that the family MOVE PLACES in the middle of their meal. The family - an older couple and a younger couple who had a baby in a stroller - pleaded with the manager, who was in her mid 20's.  \"Why should we move?\" they asked. The manager gave no answer and proceeded to move the stroller (with the child in it) away from the family, while the mother insisted that she leave the child alone. \"What have we done to you, do you have something against us?\" There was no reasonable response from the manager. She was as cold as ice. It was early and the place was relatively empty.  What was the point of having them move tables? 

What does rudeness like this do to the atmosphere of a place? It ruins it, and for that reason I'm giving Nervosa 1 star. \""}
{"text":"It's kinda the best spot in Yorkville. Hilary Duff loves it there, don't ask how I know this, but she's always spotted there when she's in town. They have no smoking on either their street side or upstairs patio, which blows hard in the summer. And again, it's a great people watching spot and better inthe summer than the winter.

The best part about this place is the pizza. They have every kind of gourmet pizza imaginable. And you can make your own too.
if you're a pizza fan, this is your spot."}
{"text":"My 2 girlfriends and I decided to stop by on a Saturday night. We knew the place was going to be busy but we've been before and loved the food. While we were eating our appetizers (on the second floor) I noticed a massive cockroach crawling right beside my friends head (we were seated at the 3 people table by the wall). We didnt want to make a big deal so we just tried calling over a server to kill it or do something, but instead they all kind of looked at each other and only pretended to be concerned while not doing anything about it. The cockroach crawled away into the ceiling and the only thing we were offered was to be moved a table right beside where we were sitting. Terrible customer service as well as clearly horrible hygiene in the restaurant,"}
{"text":"Comida deliciosa, atendimento muito bom, adega variada, cardápio extenso e ambiente agradável. Minha filha e eu somos bastante exigentes quando se trata de cozinha italiana, e aprovamos!
Sinaia O. Simões, de São Paulo, Brasil"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. I am always very impressed with the level of service and food quality. I find the flavours impactful and always feeling it was well worth the cost. Of course the roof top patio is a hidden gem in the summer.  I often have the Tagliata diManzo - which is always so perfectly cooked an tastefully paired with roasted garlic, parm cheese and avocado! the wife loves the ravioli  -   filled with pumkin and done in brown sugar!  hmmmm...."}
{"text":"Super cute, great atmosphere. Tables are very close together and busy, but that kind of adds to the European atmosphere to me. The food was great, service decent. The upstairs patio is by far the best, but the downstairs is also very charming. (only the upstairs inside I wouldn't really recommend). Very trendy, upscale restaurant, with interesting crowd of people. Food's not cheap, but I didn't find it too expensive either $20 - $30 for an entree"}
{"text":"Good food, not great food! I'm from Montreal, so I guess I have higher standards when it comes to dining out!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the continuous two days! Both the texture and flavour of their pasta are insane! The meatball spaghetti is a must-try, as well as their various pizza, the crust of them are so thin and nice! The kale salad is just so so, not that stunning as the one in gusto I've had before."}
{"text":"The food looks like it might be good, but there are many other places with dependable service. I just left without eating, having paid for a meal that was delivered cold the first time, then with approx. 25% less food when they remade. Was the server apologetic? No. Did the \"chef de cuisine toujours\" (it's on his apron) appear concerned. Also no.  Would I return? NEVER"}
{"text":"Holy Sh*t....this place sucks b@lls.

Ok..to be fair, the food was pretty good. I was in the mood for simple food and had the arugala salad and a pasta dish.   I have no complaints in the food dept.

The service however was horrendous.
I have never had a waiter come up to us with our plates more than half full, and say \"are you still working on that?\"..that just baffled me.

Also, why is it so hard to fill my water glass?  That's a no brainer.  And a must if you work in the service industry.

You can see where this is going...yes the bill took forever to come.

Wait it gets better....
The bill came to $40.67.  I gave our waiter (Muda) $60.00. 
Ok, now you do the math.  
Ask yourself, what is the best logical way to provide $19.33 as change?

1)  A 10 dollar bill, a 5 dollar bill, 2 toonies, + change.
2)  Three 5 dollar bills, 2 toonies + change.
3)  A 10 dollar bill, 4 toonies, a loonie + change.

Either of those combination's seemed logical to me.  But I almost couldn't believe my eyes, when I received $19.25, in toonies and loonies. 
 I just laughed..I thought that was unbelievable.  First of all, Who does that?  And second, if your gonna nickel and dime me...please don't short change me too.
(see the pic).  

I'm sure our waiter knew he was doing something unacceptable.  Instead of thanking us and handing us the billfold, he sent his bus boy to drop the billfold off to us.  

Our waiter claimed that the restaurant was out of fives and tens, and could only provide change in toonies and loonies. And then he said, not to tip him.  

The whole experience left me puzzled.  I would go back for the food, but not if I'm served by the same guy.  What a weirdo.

true story. (see pic)"}
{"text":"Great food and people watching. The patio is perfect for celeb sight-seeing and sipping on drinks with friends. Inside it's a little crowded, especially on the top floor. 

The pasta and salads are standard - so go for the pizza. Try out the specialty drinks - they know what they are doing.

Interesting fact: Beyonce and Jay-Z eat there when in Toronto. I don't know about you but what's good enough for Queen B is good enough for me."}
{"text":"I ordered take out on their website. I was soooo looking forward to having their rigatoni pomodoro pasta and not cooking for a night!! I have a gluten allergy, and indicated such on the order along with paying extra for the gluten free pasta. When I got back home I looked at the pasta and it was rigatoni - typically gluten free pasta is a penne. I called the restaurant to confirm if they indeed had a gf rigatoni pasta, and the guy on the phone said that they are very busy and he cannot confirm that what was given to be was gf. He told me to take a pill if I get sick!!!! WTF!! That's terrible! I used to love going there for dinner but I will never go there again. I can't believe that's how they treat customers with allergies."}
{"text":"I cannot write enough about this restaurant. It's the most amazing place in your Yorkville and one of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto. The food is awesome no matter what your order, but I recommend trying the giovedi : pollo del mattone and the caprese invernale. All the desserts are great. I Love Italian food and this place tops my list."}
{"text":"Nice and good quality food. A bit expensive in contrast to the portions. Portions are small. And the drinks were priced each time. Not by refill."}
{"text":"Amazing food and spectacular atmosphere! Sit on the patio on a warm sunny day and enjoy the Yorkville people watching, or visit in the evening and enjoy a romantic candle lit dinner. My personal fav's on the menu are the Montanerra Pizza, Caprese Salad and the made in house Mint Lemonade (mix with a little vodka).

This is definitely a summer destination, so try to avoid sitting inside and arrive before the crowds to get a seat on either the lower or upper (covered) patio. If you like to be in the sun though, the lower patio is for you. I personally prefer the upper patio in the evening and the lower patio during the day."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Amazing thin crust pizza and great chicken salad! Cute place with outdoor seating! Reasonably priced for yorkville. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Pizza is fantastic. Pastas looked good too. Grilled octopus starter was perfect. Ceasar salad was unusual in presentation, not chopped up, but was tasty. Reasonably priced for the area. Very busy and noisy on a Saturday night. Service was acceptable but not overly attentive. Would repeat if in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to start this review, but I guess I'll just get it out there:
Best pasta and meatballs I've ever had (except for my Nanna's of course).
I was sitting around in my room looking for nearby restaurants - this menu and images of the location stood out quickly and I made my way over.
I'm happy I did.
I chose to go with the Monday special of spaghetti and meatballs. I'll admit when traveling I usually stay away from staples like this and try new things, but for some reason I went with it, with a Cesare Nervosa to start. The salad was a amazing with an in-house vinaigrette - delicious.
The pasta came out and was served like something out of a magazine.
The sauce was perfectly seasoned, the pasta a perfect al dente; and the meatballs - 'forget about it'!
I'm not quick to review, but I'm actually serious when I say that this was a meal for the memory bank.
No joke - best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever eaten at a restaurant.
If you're ever in the area, I'm telling you - its a no-brainer.

{"text":"After being extremely indecisive about where to eat dinner this past Friday night (too many choices!), we ended up in Yorkville and consequently decided to try Trattoria Nervosa due to a sudden extreme craving for Italian cuisine. 

I found this restaurant to have a superb atmosphere. It looks as though it's been converted from a house, into a totally chic, two-level restaurant, separated by some creaky, narrow stairs. The restaurant has a warm and modern vibe, and the servers were really attentive. We even ended up getting a second order of complimentary bread before the meal - score! 

As an antipasti we ordered the Polpette con Provolene Affumicato (aka MEATBALLS) made out of beef, veal, and pork ground meat braised in a rich tomato sauce with smoke provolene and fresh basil.  Yum, these were to die for.. the kind of meatballs that are so tender, and just fall apart in your mouth.  They actually reminded me of my Nonna's homemade meatballs (I'll have you know that's a huge compliment).  

For my main I ordered the Proscuitto e Rucola pizza which consisted of proscuitto, shaved parmigiano, mozzerrela and arugula. The thinly-sliced proscuitto and the shaved parmigiano were the perfect savory complement, which was combined with the ideal crunch of rich flavour from the arugula. 

My only critique would be that they may need sharper knives, 'cause I was having a REAL difficult time cutting this pizza while trying to act classy. My boyfriend, who ordered a calzone style pizza, was having the same frustration. It was so delicious that all I really wanted to do was pick it up and stuff it in my face Pizza-Hut style, BUT I managed to hold back my urge, and continued to use my (lack of) muscles to tear through this pizza with my slightly dull knife.  Nevertheless, the pizza was wonderfully delicious and I will definitely return after a few more trips to the gym. Which way to the Trattoria?? *flexes*"}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta. Sure wish they offered corkage as their wine list is preey drab"}
{"text":"Yorkville is full of choices to dine at...but half the fun is watching all the people who think they are famous walk around. Nervosa gives you a great view and great food to enjoy the neighbourhood. This place is popular and busy. So if you want a romantic quiet spot...perhaps not the best. But the food is Good! Finally an italian place that does not overwhelm you with garlic and oil. Its is a bit pricey- but thats TO dining as far as I am concerned. The wait staff was friendly and efficient- they were super busy but for the most part did not miss a beat. The manager was also attentive to a mishap and quick to correct. Overall we would dine here again."}
{"text":"Cons:
Beer is very pricey at 7.49 for a bottle of mill st, and we didn't even get a glass to pour it in. The sangria is ok...a bit on the sour side. Don't get the Cesar salad...it is whole romaine leaves and a tiny bit of parmesan/capers and bacon...not worth the money. Pizza was also not great. Pizza libretto, or even ciao wine bar are far better. Didn't get water until the end of our meal... 

Pros: 
The octopus was very good! 
Haven't tried the wine, but I'm sure that's good...they had a decent list. 

I would only go back for the octopus and maybe some wine...I'm sticking to ciao for a cheaper place to eat in yorkville."}
{"text":"Great for people who love Italian food and mushrooms!

Food: Unbelievably delicious - I ordered the pappardelle ai funghi pasta dish for the main and the asiago al forno as the appetizer and they were both to die for

Quantity: Portions are a decent size, had to take half my pasta to go

Price: Pastas are around $15 - $18 bucks and appetizers are about $10 - $12

(I've been to this place twice in two weeks and will continue to go with different people to show them how great of a restaurant it is)"}
{"text":"This is definitely a busy restaurant on a Saturday night. We were a part of 12 girls so a lot too handle. My food was delicious!! Services wasn't  amazing but it was okay.. They were busy so can't blame them.. Nice location tho. Underground parking garage right opposite the restaurant. 
The pasta and bruschetta were delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy their food.. Will be visiting again for sure..!!! 
Walk-in casual or formal it's all good"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, one major problem: portions are too small. I had to order two meals for my twelve year old son. Additionally, three other people in our group had to order a second meal, including myself. If portions were larger, I would have given five stars."}
{"text":"Love the service and the patio at Nervosa. The service was nice and attentive, but not too clingy. A nice mix of casual and class. 

The sangria was light and refreshing while the meat plate was savory. A nice night overall. 

The only negative was my blackened cod. Out of a table of five people getting fish, mine was the only one without the pin bones removed. It ruined my experience a little bit."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favourite places in Yorkville - as a student. It's got a brilliant street patio that overlooks Pink Tartan and Anthropologie - what more can a girl ask for? drooling over great fashion while enjoy a good meal and not to forget people watching - quite amusing.

I've dined there several times for dinner. Its Italian food - the pastas and pizzas are good and super great for a budget in Yorkville.  The margheritta pizza has just the right touch of melted mozarella and tomato sauce and the vegeterian pasta hits the right spot.

The atmosphere is good - the interior is small and comfortable.

The service is okay - i've personally never had a bad experience here.

So if you want a nice casual evening in yorkville, Cafe Nervosa is a good bet!"}
{"text":"Very tiny inside and out. The patio was built for tiny people or kids. The service was quick and they gave ample free bread. My wife and I both found the food just \"ok\"....we wouldn't go again but that being said it takes a very special place to get us to dine more than once."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend after a day of shopping, it was quite busy when we came in. The place is fairly small, but the ambiance is cozy and relaxed. We started of with the grilled calamari, which was grilled to perfection while perfectly chewable, the best grilled calamari I've ever had! my friend had some penne dish, while I got the mafalde de fungi (mushroom pasta). The pastaw as perfectly aldante, and the sauce was so creamy, while bursting with the earthy mushroom flavour.. Will visit again :)"}
{"text":"Cafe Nervosa is one of my faves. It is a great place to drop by for lunch if you're out shopping or work nearby and has delicious food. My grandmother is in love with it as well but I come here with friends mostly. I love their tuna salad and beef salad. Their caesar is fine but very much an appetizer and not a favourite. Their pizzas are what to really write home about because they have amazing thin crusts and perfect toppings. Even a simple margherita pizza is delicious because of the freshness of the basil they use. Their Tiramisu is AMAZING. One of the best I've had anywhere. Only downside is that if you are chatting post meal then they don't give you your bill quickly and you end up sitting there forever waiting around for them."}
{"text":"They have the best Italian pizza in the city, pizza crust is tender and yummy and their special kale salad is a must try"}
{"text":"Have been to gusto 101 and expected food of the same quality. It's not. My favourite funghi pasta was dry and congealed, too much overcooked pasta and not enough sauce or truffles. 

Dining environment is not worthy of being located in Yorkville. Cramped, crowded and noisy. More like dining in a cafeteria or market rather than a romantic Italian restaurant. Tables and fold up chairs stuck everywhere - I understand making a few extra seats to make some more $$ but this is really too much. 

Overall, if you love gusto don't come here...it is nothing like it."}
{"text":"Bellissima! The food is amazing. After a long day at the reference library we took a short stroll to Nervosa. Thankfully we got seated right away. Despite the cramped space, the food and service make up for it. I had pizza and my boyfriend had pasta and we barely spoke as we devoured it. The desserts! I ordered the tiramisu and wanted to order another right after to go because it was that good. My boyfriend got the cake with figs and he still craves it days later. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.  They unfortunately won't accept reservations but other than that everything is great.  I was a little surpised that they wouldn't make an exception in order for me to propose, but it worked out better elsewhere anyways.  

The atmosphere is nice with our favourite table being isolated on the small balcony facing Yorkville Avenue.  A great summer location overall.

The bison carpaccio is excellent.  We;ve had a number of entrees there all of which were good, but nothing amazing.  

I would go here with expectation of having a consistently good meal and enjoying the neighbourhood in the summer, but I wouldn't go with the expectation of having an astounding culinary experience."}
{"text":"Posted this in both of Nervosa's listings (Cafe and Restaurant) as it's the same place with the same waiters:

One of the meals had a piece of METAL SCRUBBER in our food.

We pointed it out, got a new meal, still got charged for the old one in the end. 

Even better : they tried to force us to pay the mandatory 18% tip.

We paid 10-15% tip each because of one of us having to ingest a piece of metal in our meal. 
We actually got chased outside to come back in the restaurant and pay the extra 3% tip.

-------------------------------
The location is SO bad. Every few minutes there are these loud bikes and high-end cars blasting their radio and leaking their fumes in the restaurant. You can't speak over the noise, it is anything BUT personal and comfy
-------------------------------

Would you like premium gas with your sub-premium meal? Thanks!

Why does this place not 100% bad reviews? It is EXPENSIVE, terrible service, the bread they serve with the appetizer isn't even warm (it tastes like it was made a while ago).

The food was tasty but it wasn't a WOW factor. I think they try to maintain some high class image but it really isn't.

There are many, many, MANY other italian place in Toronto that serve just as good food for way less $$.

Would never go back, terrible service, location and price

(I've attached an image of the metal scrubbie in question.)"}
{"text":"Although the food at this place is always consistently good, the menu is somewhat bland. I love the place though, the service, the wine list, the atmosphere specially on summer evenings on the balcony. It's good wholesome Italian food. I just wish they'd update their menu once in a while."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner her and we all loved it! The server was very attentive and answered all my friends' questions about the menu. Service was prompt and all our food and drinks came super fast even though it was a busy night! At the end our server brought the cheesecake I ordered with a lit candle which was a great end to my birthday! I definitely recommend the restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance.  Food so-so.  Sat inside at a quaint table.  Nice atmosphere, open windows to the street and all.  Food overall was very adequate.  Spinach and gorgonzola salad, with no dressing.  Trio of meat, was just that, nothing to add to the flavors.  Smallest double cappuccino I have ever had.  The banana Tiramisu was good.  If I go back, I'll try the pizza that that is supposed to be so good.  Our server was good, but very busy.  Hilary Duff was not sited."}
{"text":"I went for a late lunch on a weekday, and the restaurant was relatively quiet when my friend and I sat down. We sat at a table by the window which would be perfect for people watching when the streets come alive in the spring. 

Our server was patient. I was indecisive on what to drink -I'm sorry- and he came back just the right amount of times. 
One of the dishes we ordered was the Bruschetta ai Funghi, and the truffle oil was so so good, I actually felt sad when we finished it. 

One thing I disliked was that a group of ladies came in and although there were other tables available, the server sat them right beside our table. No big deal, it just felt really busy in half the room."}
{"text":"It's not opulent.  But the pizzas are tasty. And you can't argue with the primo people watching. And it's affordable n everythin'."}
{"text":"Pasta was yummy as well were the salads. The fish was very moist. The Bronzino was delicious. It was so much fun ordering on Uber Eats!!  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food the for those who is addict to salad the kale salad is must to try, but the place was so crowded and noisy the tables were so close to each other in my point of view I don't like such a crowded place, the service was quick and fast ."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today. I was a regular customer until a couple of years ago when I moved away from Yorkville. We went by this evening and were 'welcomed' by the rudest host I've ever seen. First she says they have place for 2. Then she said there's a wait time and refused to estimate how long it would take. Then motioned with her hand and fingers and said 'move outside' like she's talking to cattle. I told her to take my name off the list as there's no way I'm ever going back to Nervosa. Instead we went to a lovely patio nearby and spent over $600 for a good bottle of wine, a bunch of appetizers and a main course."}
{"text":"Amazing outdoor patio, usually a long wait for a table out there in the summer, but worth it if you have the time. Food was pretty good, most stars are for the venue. Complimentary bread a little stale."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!! The mafalde ai funghi was amazing! Service was great! Yorkville is a great place to walk around too!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Food is consistently good for a fast food type Italian restaurant. They don't always get the order right. Spaghetti is done well with a simple tomato sauce. Wine selection is great. Not that expensive given the Yorkville Digs. Fast service."}
{"text":"Really liked the food...it's not the best but great for reasonable price! Service is decent but staff can use some service training! They should be able to recommend something from the menus rather than saying everything is good!"}
{"text":"Tucked in a subtle storefront, Cafe Nervosa is one of my favourites in the Yorkville neighbourhood. 

The staff, albeit more on the silent than chatty side, attend to the tables in a respectable manner. The inside of the restaurant is quaint, and in the summer time is a great oasis away from the heat. 

I always order one of the thin crust pizzas as it was quite lovely. The \"Prosciutto e Rucola\" is my choice with hefty strips of Italian ham (prosciutto), parmesan cheese and topped with crisp arugula. The pizza comes whole, and you cut the pieces yourself. I've heard this is the \"traditional\" way of serving pizza and definitely don't mind doing some grunt work.

My boyfriend ordered the clam pasta (\"Spaghetti alla Chitarra con Vongole e Gamberi\"). The olive oil dressing went wonderfully with the seafood and the chili flakes added that extra heat to make it more than just a normal dish.

The sangria is really great. A bit pricey at $43 a pitcher, but definitely fruity and refreshing if you are willing to spend the cash.

A wonderful spot for a date or summer dinner with friends."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Italian places I've ever had, and I've been to Italy. Mushroom pasta was delicious, rissotto was unbelievable. Amazing all around."}
{"text":"My date and I came here on a warm July evening and we were seated on the patio fairly quickly for peak dinner time, although I was facing the setting sun and potentially burning my face off before I got to stuff it with food. The food was quite filling. I know pasta in general is quite filling, but it wasn't like one of those places that skimped on portions. It was generous. I had Spaghetti alla Chitarra con Vongole e Gamberi ($17.99) which had little neck clams, Tiger shrimp, white wine, fresh tomato, chilies Nervosa olive oil. Overall the food was great, the service was great, but the terrible seating made me not award the full 5 stars. I won't hold it against them, though; I could've been a little more aggressive and just asked my date to switch with me, or I could've just requested for a better seat. Anyway, the sun set, I dealt with it."}
{"text":"It's our second time at Nervosa, the first time we only came for a glass of wine but this time we also tried their pizza!

It's very nice and cozy on the rooftop patio and we had the same waiter both time, very good and attentive service. 

We had the arugula, parmigiano and prosciutto pizza and it was really good. I like to add tons of spicy oil on my pizza and they let me do it :)

The crown is casual and relax, it's not too loud and you can hear yourselves talk. It's also cool that the decor includes random wooden mirrors and cutting boards on the walls... makes it look authentic!

I would recommend for a date or small group of friends."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing small Italian restaurant that I can't believe it took me this long to discover it. Located in Yorkville, there are sufficient parking spots conveniently located close to the restaurant.

Restaurant has two floors. We walked in on a Friday night at 9pm. A group of 3 still took us 15-20mins of a wait time. Book a reservation to avoid wait time. I did get a little bit impatient but the wait is wellllll worth it. Also, a group of 3 is always harder to get a table i guess...

*** Mafalde ai Funghi *** this is the hands down DA BEST mushroom pasta I have everrrr had. Mushrooms included: portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster mushrooms
Light cream sauce with parmigiano topped with some truffle paste
$19

First bite already got me!! Because it is so creamy, so rich, SO GOOD that I want to lick the plate. Portion is good too! You might think how special a mushroom pasta can be but I want to convince you that, the easiest food item def takes the most skills to deliver a rich flavored satisfying dish.

I ordered a coffee to end the dinner as I got so full from the pasta. The coffee also wow-ed me! Rich dark coffee with some amazing aroma. Also, the cream WAS HEATED WARM for us, so thoughtful!! Love it!!

Last piece of advice, avoid sitting on the 2nd floor. The servers keep running up and down to deliver food from kitchen downstairs to the upper floor. I just personally would like to avoid my food being travelled like that if you know what I mean... hygiene reasons."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times.  Food and menu options are very good.  It's good quality authentic Italian food (not Italian American).  The atmosphere is very nice.  The service however is very poor.  
We had an Octopus salad, Capellini with tomato sauce &  Margherita pizza.  For drinks we had a limonata and an aranciata."}
{"text":"Trattoria Nervosa is a cute little restaurant in the heart of Yorkville - great for client lunches, get-together's with your girlfriends or date night. Serving an amazing Italian menu, there are two things on the menu that I personally can't get enough: Insalata di Cavolo Nero and Mafalde ai Funghi. You're probably wondering what the hell is that, well, let me begin to describe what you are missing out as you're reading this:

- Insalata di Cavolo Nero is a kale salad. It is probably the most unhealthy kale salad you will ever eat. In every bite, you get a balance of the toasted pine nuts, shaved pecorino, parmigiano and lemon vinaigrette. I generally find kale a bit bitter, but this was not bitter at all. 

- Mafalde ai Funghi is a portobello pasta in a cream sauce. Like the kale salad it is a very rich dish with a fantastic blend of flavours. I

My recommendation would be order both and share it between you and another person. You can get a taste of each dish and by the end of it, you'll be stuffed."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, especially on the patio. Be careful of the stairs as they can be a hazard. Good was delicious. Had the octopus and calamari to start, and the beef on mushroom risotto."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant...and living in ny I can def distinguish a decent and a great Italian restaurant.. overall pasta and pizza on point..4 star only bc waiters were somewhat disinterested in their job and wanted us to leave earlier than we wanted...."}
{"text":"Attn Foodies!!! Be forewarned this place is basically just another Gusto 101. They are owned by the same people and the menus are almost identical. 

With that being said, I enjoyed Gusto and therefore enjoyed Nervosa as well. The Kale salad is delicious, even though I am not the biggest fan of kale this salad is sooo good. We also got the meatballs to start and they were so good, just like homemade Italian meatballs with little bits of melted cheese on them, and the right amount of sauce. I ordered their mushroom pasta and it was so delicious and not too heavy at all! I think they get the creaminess down perfectly without it being as heavy as gnocchi can be. My boyfriend and I were both too stuffed for dessert so you'll definitely get full here! 

The ambiance is nice, it's basically just a converted house. I don't like that the food has to travel in open air up and down the stairs, but besides that if I had to go again I definitely wouldn't refuse."}
{"text":"Menu is very similar to Gusto 101 (which is one of my favorite restaurants)... I love both of these spots. They have such a unique atmosphere. 

Ordered a baked cheese dish - delish! Also the most amazing scallop entrée. The scallops were ginormous! Biggest I've ever seen and cooked to perfection. Served with the most amazing rice dish ever (or was it a rice like pasta? Sorry no access to menu to confirm) - but wow incredible buttery flavour and combination of vegetables was magical. Mmmmhmm.... (see photo) 

Highly recommend. I'm sure their pizza is bomb diggity like Gusto as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Worst service... be prepared to wait more than 1 hour to get in. I wish they have a Italian vibe there.. when you want Italian food you wish to be in a cozy place served by nice, happy people. It's not real Italian food when the vibe is wrong."}
{"text":"In Yorkville and looking for an amazing Italian restaurant? Your search is over! Cafe Nervosa always hits the spot! The funghi pasta and bolognese pasta are amazing..you won't find better funghi pasta in Toronto. The pizzas at Nervosa are also great...we tried the rapini and buffalo mozzarella pizza...a bit salty but otherwise no complaints. My personal favourite is the short rib risotto - This one I had to eat on my own without sharing. You might have to wait 30 minutes to get seated but the service is great and the food comes out super quick."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after hearing so much about this place.
My experience was just average, I had expected better considering this is where jayz & bey dined at! 

They don't reservations, so the wait was about 15-20 mins, however once we were seated and we inquired about a table that had a better view we were told that it's \"reserved\" REALLY?!? (Fail!) 

Food, I got the pasta with loads of shrooms, it was great, just a little dry. Gusto 101, does the same pasta so much better. 

Noise level: extremely loud, could hardly hear my friend 

Service: average. Our server was quite busy! 

Would I go again- maybe!"}
{"text":"I love old school Italian dining. There are few places left in Toronto that have a great menu, but that also caters too that true Italian cuisine.

The ambiance is great and the food excellent. The wait staff are friendly and the owner and hosts always greet you with a smile and warm wishes. 

Right in the heart of Yorkville, so there is plenty to look forward to, before and afterwards."}
{"text":"Seating is a tad cramped and tables close but the food is delicious. Outside is definitely preferred. It is simple authentic Italian prepared beautifully. Anyone expecting something different than the offerings does not understand true Italian. The caprese added pink peppercorns to a delightful salad which was the perfect touch. Pizza is very scrumptious. Definitely try the sangria! The attention to detail in each plate is very noticeable. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"We found this townhouse restaurant by accident and were rewarded with a great lunch.  It is cozy, and not fancy.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy the food and ambiance.  Our pizzas were terrific,and the wine by the carafe was good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good italian food. The bolognese was great, and from what I saw and heard from my neighbors, the shortrib was also good. Wine selection is decent and the fact that they have outdoor seating makes it even better. Food came out fast, but not so fast you think they are rushing you out. So why only 3 stars? The service wasn't great. It wasn't horrible, just not great. Once you have your food you're pretty much on your own until you flag someone down."}
{"text":"Pretty stingy with their wine pours.  I didn't care much for the service, and really didn't appreciate being rushed (mid-week, plenty of open tables), but the Spaghetti Carbonara was excellent.  That alone, would make me go back!  Prices fairly reasonable for Yorkville too."}
{"text":"This is the kind of food that makes me crave food.  Will be coming back for the mushroom truffle pasta and carpaccio."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here. While the ambience and the location were great, the food was not. All four dishes my friends and I ordered left us unsatisfied. My pasta was undercooked and the flavours didn't blend well. My friends dish with risotto was bland. None of us ordered the pizza which is probably a mistake in hindsight as it probably would have been somewhat better than their pasta and secondi selections.

2/5. Would not return again."}
{"text":"Make sure you check out the rooftop patio if the weather is good! Its adorable! Came here on a hot summer day so I decided to have sangria with my meal, which was a great choice because the flavour was spot on. The tables are really close together so it is a little cramped, but still comfy. 
I ordered the Malfade Ai Funghi, which was delicious! I love mushrooms and although I'm usually not a huge fan of cream-based pastas, I really enjoyed this one. I would definitely order this again if I was to return. 
At the end of the meal, I had the tiramisu and it was alright.. nothing too impressive though. The cream of the tiramisu was less cream-texture and more pudding-texture. Would probably try a different dessert next time."}
{"text":"Live in the neighbourhood... Really great food. High quality ingredients, excellent cooking, fun environment--and the food? the food's very good. Get the kale salad, it is excellent!"}
{"text":"Sitting here right now having the beef carpaccio. 

Fantastic. 

And I don't remember the name but it is a sort of mushroom truffle pasta. Something Italian but it is top notch.

A little bit El Dente which is what I prefer but make sure to ask if you prefer it cooked different."}
{"text":"The pastas were incredible; flavourful and filling. If rating on food alone I would give it 5 stars. The hostess and serving staff were a bit clipped given how busy they were. The water was room temperature and I got a gruff response when I tried to order Wednesday's special on a Saturday... maybe this very authentic Italian cuisine should have English subtitles.
I would come again when it wasn't so busy/crowded."}
{"text":"I ordered a negroni, it was great as expected. Super simple cocktail. I was with a coworker and we split the kale salad and the funghi pasta. Amazing food. The portion sizes were a little smaller than expected. Overall a good experience. I will be back for that pasta!"}
{"text":"Was there for a private party in October in the upstairs space...Great pizza and cappucino, service was good as well."}
{"text":"Cutest, coziest atmosphere in Yorkville. And delicious, delicious Italian food. That's really all you need to know. Try the funghi pasta, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was long overdue for another meet-up with the fashionable twosome - last time I saw them was at The Drake for brunch, and then the following weekend at The Drake for drinks.  Wow, variety is the spice of life?  

This dynamic duo never disappoint.  I wish I could post  a photo of them but that could lead to my identity...so instead, I will just say that no one else pulls of effortless Sunday chic like these two.
  
This Sunday's meet-up was in Yorkville and we settled on Trattoria Nervosa or as we simple folk say, Café Nervosa. It sits on the corner of Yorkville and Bellair and has long been a place I recommend to my bois when they ask where to take a girl on a date. It's like a less obnoxious, but more expensive 7 West. 

I love Nervosa's upstairs patio, but it was full so we had to eat at ground level. Humf. 

As soon as we sat down, I'm thinking I could use a cup of coffee, but my buds are pointing out the wines. Miss N pointed to the Pinot Grigio Nervosa & VI.  I had never heard of it, but she said it's \"sooo good\", and you know what, she was \"sooo right\" - it was light, fresh and delish. Every Sunday should involve a couple glasses of Pinot. Like, every Sunday.

I had the Tagliata di Manzo - a grilled beef tenderloin salad with arugala, red onions, avocado, roasted tomatoes, shaved pecorino (one of my favourite cheeses) and balsamic vinagrette. The awesome twosome shared Linguine alle Vongole (little neck clams, chilli flakes, garlic and herbs, white wine, tomatoes and olive oil) and the Contadina pizza with arugula ontop. (Psst, did you know that arugula is also called rocket or roquette. I know, I'm full of useless information.)

Nervosa's food is great - well-made, well-seasoned, and quality ingredients. Personally, I don't think you can really screw up Italian food - it's elementary science - you take quality ingredients and combine them in winning ways. 

I say it's delicious, Miss N and Mister B would simply say \"delish\". They shorten EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Good little place with a homey ambiance. Came on a Sunday around lunch. It was very busy but we got seated right away. 

Pros:
- Pasta was tasty (Mafalde ai Funghi) 
- Good service 
- Quick service 

Cons:
-Pricey for the quantity of food"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for lunch in Yorkville. Wonderful staff, attentive service. Dressy casual, great vibe, welcoming. Lunch was a pizza and salad with a nice glass of red."}
{"text":"This is my usual Sunday spot for lunch.

Fantastic pasta and pizza. Cool place with great menu variety and some of the best people watching in the city.

Make sure if you go you either sit upstairs inside or one of the patios as the downstairs floor has you sitting far too close too other guests and can get very hot.

Service has been fantastic in the past but the last time we went was some of the worst service I've had in a while anywhere. Willing to chalk it up to catching our bad attitude waiter on a bad day.

Would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great. 
Service actually needs some improvements (e.g.we asked for some bread the staff said of course but never came back with bread..)
Recommend:
Baked cheese appetizer(god it was tasty)
Kale salad
Mixed funghi pasta
Tiramisu"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!! Service was impeccable, food was delicious, and ambiance was pleasant. I had the Margherita pizza and it was a perfect amount of food for one. The menu is a bit daunting, but their selection of wine is rather astonishing and also quite delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing pumpkin ravioli. Comfortable vibe, average service. Great for a cozy small dinner or a group."}
{"text":"I've had the Mafalde ai Funghi ($19+tax) at Gusto 101 (sister company of Trattoria Nervosa) which is supposed to be once of the best pasta's in TO. It tasted exactly like Gusto when I got it yesterday. Portion looks small but the pasta is very rich and filling. I had a craving at lunch and ordered this take-out, pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavour was amazing as usual. Service was good, this place is pretty pricey but I think it's worth it. When I went to pick up at lunch it was packed, reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to the high expectations I had after hearing a friend of mine rave about it. She's been many times and this was a first time for me. I was a bit concerned that it might not be worth the prices they charge like other restaurants in Yorkville but I have to say, I can't think of a single real thing wrong with the whole experience. 

I ordered the mafalde ai funghi that my friend had been going on about and told me I had to try. She was right. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce was rich and creamy with lots of mushrooms. When it got to the table, the scent of truffles was overwhelming in a good way. Really a spot on dish that I would highly recommend to have here. Although I could have eaten an entire pot of this stuff, the portion was just about right, not so much as to make you feel bloated afterwards. The drinks are quite pricey but hey, it's Yorkville and the ingredients in their cocktails do seem to be of good quality (nice fresh herbs and garnishes etc).

We got there around 8 pm on saturday and were nervous we wouldn't get a table but it was only about a 10 minute wait and the line was moving quite quickly. The waiter was super friendly and although we sat outside, it was a nice night out. Didn't see much of the interior but it looks quite nice from what I saw. I would definitely come back here to try more dishes. 

To put it over the edge, upon going to their instagram page, I found out that a dollar from every mafalde and kale salad goes to hurricane relief effort which I think is cool of them. Glad I supported that (even if it was unknowingly lol)."}
{"text":"Very warm and inviting. Ate upstairs where it was quaint and we sat at a table that overlooked Yorkville. Food was wonderful. Bread with olives and melted cheese was amazing! Pastas were excellent. In particular the pasta with mushrooms was outstanding! Excellent wait staff! I Recommend this place for lunch on a spring/summer or Fall day when you can walk around Yorkville before or after lunch!"}
{"text":"Set in an old mansion in downtown Toronto's luxurious neighborhood of Yorkville- Trattoria Nervosa is basic italian at it's finest. If you're looking for a chich place to eat- this is the place. Decor is white with basic tables and decor. Open, airy with an outdoor patio off the main level perfect for that mid-afternoon glass of vino with friends. Often very busy and difficult to get seating... and once seated- the service staff can be difficult to catch."}
{"text":"Trattoria Nervosa is a great little restaurant that serves authentic Italian cuisine. They carry the 'authentic' Italian feeling throughout the restaurant; the staff are trained in correct pronunciation of the menu, the decor reminded me of my trip in Italy and the food was excellent. 

I've dined at this place twice and have had great service and food each time. I've had the asiago & crostini appetizer, marguerita pizza with prosciutto, and veal & lamb ragout bolognese. Each dish I highly recommend. 

I would have given this restaurant five stars if it weren't for a slightly less enjoyable experience my second time. I ordered the same main as my previous visit (the bolognese) but found the dish to be way too salty."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with some friends and we had a really good time. The service was mediocre (the waiters weren't as attentive as I would have liked) but the ambiance was really nice. This restaurant would cater to someone who would want to go on a romantic date with a partner. However, it was a little bit loud.  The seating area is limited and they squish as many tables as they can into the dining area. It was slightly difficult to get up and visit the ladies room. 

On a high note, the food tasted really good. I had the salmon with lentils and sea snails. I had never had snails before and the texture was slightly squishy. It was interesting to try but I don't think I will go out of my way to try snails again. The texture seemed a little off for me. They didn't taste bad though. The flavour blended into the flavour of the lentils, so I might describe it as similar to tofu, which takes on the flavour you infuse it with.

Both of my friends ordered pasta and they really enjoyed it. 

All over I would give this restaurant a solid three stars."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, cute patios, decent prices... but nothing stood out as extremely memorable. I have nothing specific to criticize, but I don't think I'll remember this meal in a week's time. The pistachio gelato was the best part."}
{"text":"You are paying for nice ambience and location. The food is good, but not particularly impressive. I have had most of the pizzas and they are all good. Pasta is more of a hit and miss. Never had the deserts. The wine list is okay and the service can be really good sometimes, but not always. The place can get really loud -- so try to avoid it if you plan on having a good conversation."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing
The best meal I've had in Toronto for sure. I was impressed with the taste of the dish. Simply perfect!"}
{"text":"Love the food, the location, the ambience. Best pizza evs! I really love this place so I'm going to round up my 4.5. This place is super fast-paced, so don't expect attentive service. Also I think the service used to be better but was lacking the last few times I was there, that's why I took off the 0.5. 

Super chic place in the midst of Yorkville. The decor has a lot of character even though it's a bit cramped inside. It's not a really big place and you really don't get a lot of privacy because the next table is just literally a breath away from you. However, during nice weather the patio and roof patio should be opened. 

I love everything here. Pizza's great, super thin chewy crust, tasty sauce, delicious ingredients whether it is spicy sausauge, proscuitto, fresh basil or arugula, combined with flavourful cheeses. It's Italian goodness rolled into a thin sheet. I haven't tried too many of the other entrees. Pasta is good and fresh. Tried the ceasar salad, it's a bit on the small side for sure, but still very tasty, Bruschetta is just okay for me, not enough flavour. However, the oven-baked Asiago served with crostinis is divine!

So far, one of the best Italian restaurants in town. I love coming back here when I'm in the area. A nice weekend would be Nervosa plus a massage in one of the nearby spas. But it does get pretty busy on the weekend. Not really sure about reservations etc. But it just seems like you will just have to wait during busy times. I need to come back to try more of their other dishes when I'm not just craving pizza!"}
{"text":"I thought the food to be a light fare. Not heavy but also not as flavourful as most Italian foods. They offer a good menu for lunch but dinner not much variation. It is a trendy hip place to be but the food isn't quite all that it's cracked up to be. Never the less I still recommend it if your in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Soo yummy!  Just never ever come during lunch hour with a large group.  The food service is S-L-O-W, but I gotta say, attentive.  I gouged myself on the mushroom cream pasta when it finally came like the ravenous beast that I became after waiting and waiting and waiting... as food for smaller tables came and went around us.

Beautiful upstairs patio that I can't wait to try!  This place is a lot bigger than it looks from the first floor."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The ambience is really cute- small, personal, contemporary bistro feel. The food was very good:
- Pumpkin Gnocchi with brown butter and sage: pillowy, delish goodness
- Bruschetta with mushrooms and truffle paste and parmesean shaved on top: Awesome
- Pizza with proscuitto and goat cheese and gorgonzola with oyster mushrooms: Wow. We couldn't get enough of it
- Caprese Salad: really not quite a salad...but the mozzarella was good 

The service was quick, efficient and friendly...will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Mediocre with sneaky servers - pass on this one guys.

I went with a group of 10 to this restaurant on a Friday night on the advice of a friend, but wish I hadn't have.  The waiter was constantly trying to \"direct\" us towards higher priced items, and even had the gall to ask for a tip on the credit card bill even though tip had already automatically been added due to the size of our party! 

I wish I could say that my experience was redeemed by the quality of the food, however the pasta dish I ordered was not consistently cooked.  I have no idea how they managed this one but certain parts were cooked perfectly while others were hard as a rock (did they forget to the stir the pot?)"}
{"text":"Quaint roof top patio, amazing pizza and decent pasta (I ordered the mixed funghi pasta - the flavour was bland, it needed a kick)"}
{"text":"The place is in a great location. We did a large group menu. They literally give you filler to eat. They should be ashamed that they charge $50 for crap.  Then drinks then 18% gratuity. First comes, A large, very very large \"salad\"  that is just made of dandelion greens, oil, 3 cherry tomatoes, a little but of cheese. The portion was so disgustingly big I felt like a horse eating grass. They are just trying to fill ppl up. Then came a nasty risotto with dry af short ribs. Then you get a scoop of melted ass vanilla gelato. For $50. Diners are not stupid. We have been to many other places with large parties before. Gusto group and the lady Judge on tv should be ashamed to serve people farm feed. This place didn't even try. All staff were Indian staff expect a few white managers. I hate places like this. Gross."}
{"text":"The other reviews that criticize this place's service are quite accurate -- it's terrible!  I've been here a few times, and I'll admit the food is tasty and reasonably priced.  As an Italian, it's quite satisfying.

But the service is another story.  After you're seated, you can expect to end up sitting down for at least 10 minutes before your waiter will actually approach you.  Drinks come pretty quickly, and so does the food once you've ordered, but it's not thanks to your waiter.  It seems that the bus boys running around carry out the brunt of the work.  The waiters are often useless.  If you ask for a glass of water, you'll be lucky to get it in 15 minutes.  

Thank god for the bus boys!  I hope they get a nice chunk of the tip."}
{"text":"Quite a romantic little spot here in yorkville. Didn't realize this was actually a sister restaurant of gusto 101, which I absolutely love. Was a bit disappointed that they didn't serve the house wines by the ounce like they did at gusto. $1 and ounce of house wine! Loved that about gusto. There's a neat second floor spot that is perfect for group parties and in the summer they have a small area on the patio as well. Love the decor and ambiance here. Service is excellent and it seems like a happening spot. I would bring my friends back here if I was in the yorkville area. Get their kale salad with the steak side you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best visited on a sunny day when you can enjoy the patio scene and sunshine eating delicious flatbread pizza and coffee. Everything is authentically Italian, including the atmosphere which makes you feel like you want to put on some shades and order wine for dessert. It really doesn't get better than this on a nice afternoon in Yorkville."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants that I've been to. It has the Italian vibe.
The cheese dip and Pizza are must-to-have dishes"}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and loved our dinner here. We checked out photos of the food before our reservation and everything looked SO good - especially the (apparently famous) mushroom pasta.

We had a gift card so we were able to try a few things. We started with the Asiago al Forno, which was AMAZING. I mean, melted cheese in a sizzling crock. Can't really go wrong. We almost didn't order it because it seemed a little over the top for 2 people to split but I don't regret one bite. 

Next, we split the Kale salad which is one of the best I've ever had. Currants, toasted pine nuts, shaved pecorino, Parmigiano, and a lemon vinaigrette that was just perfect. Shockingly this was one of my favorite things from the entire meal.

For mains we shared the Diavola pizza, which was good but the runt of our dinner. We enjoyed the spice from the giardiniera but silly me thought there would be pepperoni or spicy salami like other pizzas we've had by the same name. This one was strictly veggies but the spice was a nice hit and cut the richness of our order. 

Of course we tried the mushroom pasta. It was good but I think we hyped it a bit. It was definitely tasty and the pasta was perfectly done but I would have liked a little bit more depth, maybe a tad more salt and a hint of truffle to really take the mushroom flavor over the top. Overall though, yeah it's a great creamy, comforting dish and I totally see why there are dozens of photos of it. 

The ambiance was cute and more casual than I would have expected. It's a relatively small place with clear visibility into the pizza oven part of the kitchen. Our service was excellent, especially considering how leisurely we were completing our dinner. 

We're so glad we were able to visit while in the city and hope to be back again."}
{"text":"Busy on a Tuesday night at 7:30!
Worth the wait. Enjoyed the signature mushroom pasta. Was phenomenal. Took a doggie bag for lunch the next day.
My man had pizza, said it was good. But he was really jazzed about the kale salad. Good old fashioned. Def come here again."}
{"text":"IL BUONO:

Fettucine ai Funghi ($16.49) is rife with enough truffle oil and mushroom varieties to make Mario immortal. Agnolotti di Zucca ($16.99) is another rich option - roasted pumpkin, browned butter, sage and cheese add up to the most full-bodied ravioli you could have without any cream. I find the other pasta dishes a little hit-or-miss. The personal pizzas are short of amazing but generally pretty delicious. I literally ate next to Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a pizzeria in Brooklyn last summer, and then they ate at Nervosa when they were in Toronto. So if this 'za is good enough for Hova, I guess it's good enough for you.

IL BRUTTO:

Tables are crammed so close together, your elbow won't respect the elbow of the lady dining next to you in the morning. Sitting down, going to the restroom and getting up to leave all involve a lot of uncomfortable squeezing and \"excuse me\"s. The fact that they jam people in just to get extra wallets through the door is a bit of a turnoff, especially when it leaves diners struggling to have conversations above the noise.

IL CATTIVO:

Most graceless host I've ever encountered. When my friend and I walked in the door, he asked if we were \"mom and daughter\". Uh, no, we're the same [non-motherly] age. You'd think his mouth would be too full of foot to continue, but he tried: \"Sisters? You look the same!\" No, we're NOT related. He came back after we were seated with some excuse (that he had been waiting for a mother and daughter pair) but the obviousness of his lie made it worse. No apology. Privo di tatto!"}
{"text":"Very very good Italian food and wine. Very authentic! Their pizzas are amazing, and the pastas are breathtaking."}
{"text":"Cute intimate little Trattoria. The food was very good (a bit more sauce with the lasagne would be great). Their olive appetizer is wonderful with a nice assortment and great flavor. 
The service was attentive and prompt. I enjoyed it greatly and would certainly make a return visit to try the risotto caccio e pepe!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Quaint setting. Food was delicious. 

Highly recommend!  

Gusto 101 is also delicious!"}
{"text":"The only thing that blows me away on the menu is the butternut squash agnolotti, which is consistent and always on the menu. I went recently with my mother who ordered their fish special to which she found the accompanying sauce overly salty at first, but complementing overall. The fish was very fresh, clean and not overcooked. Portions are good, we all left uncomfortably stuffed.

There is never a long wait, and the staff here are always friendly and exude a positivity, which at times is frustrating because they love everything on the menu so much, even the unsavory choices. My most recent waitress was vegan, and most of their dishes concocted from meat and cheese, I'm not sure how great her personal judgement could have been.

You can get better Italian for the price in the city, but is on the more reasonable side for its neighbourhood location."}
{"text":"Recently had a wonderful dinner of antipasti and and pizza at this wonderful stop.  Antipasti was a generous assortment of cured meats, olives, cheeses and spreads with accompanying crisp breads.   A delight on the last of the summer-like weekends.   

Had a rather delicious pizza with rather overpowering Gorgonzola patches.   excellent pizza until the periodic Gorgonzola encounters.....which wrestled my taste buds to the ground and beat them over the head with a rather heavy mallet.  

The corner table on the balcony was perfect, especially when supported by the warm heaters in a cool evening breeze.  A lovely end to a day in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Love this place for a good vibe, great food and wine. If there's just two of you sit at the food service bar. Chat with the chefs. Great time."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here. It was very underwhelming. I didn't enjoy the Margharita pizza at all"}
{"text":"This place seems to be hit or miss depending on who is working and how busy they are. Some restaurants keep their standards up no matter how busy or crazy it gets, but you can see that this is one of those places that never plans on getting busy so the flustered looks and shortened attention spans come out when they do.

Food is always good. I prefer upstairs where it is quieter. I've never gotten a bill that I was shocked at."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times but after a glorious discovery of sample sale in the area, decided to stop by here after for some Italian on a Thursday evening. 

We started with the meatballs, which were really tasty and then we split rigatoni al pomodoro which I thought was decent - pasta was cooked well and sauce was moderately flavourful but nothing spectacular and we also split the prosciutto pizza which I thought was much too salty. All of this was beyond filling for the 2 of us. 

This place looks like it'd be adorable during the summer time on the patio. Also, keep in mind they do not accept reservations after 6pm however, they really work their magic to get things turned around as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Service, food, and atmosphere--excellent!!

I've been here a couple of times, once inside and once upstairs on the patio. The outdoor patio was lovely. The pizza is great..thin crust and not too much cheese. I appreciate having the option for whole wheat crust. The servers are great and attentive even when it's busy. 

Must try: a glass of white wine sangria.. it's great!"}
{"text":"I looooove it! I had the Agnolotti do Zucca which was a really great vegetarian option! It was pasta with butternut squash pumpkin seeds and brown sauce! The people I went with had incredible picks as well! Pizza was a great portion size! The mushroom pasta was great! Lasagna with butternut squash was TO DIE FOR! And the veal pasta was great!
Only negative: we ordered a pitcher of sangria and was told it would serve 8 glasses. It only served 5 and a half (and our glasses weren't even filled! We filled them 2/3 of the way up) 

However;  Would definitely go back! Staff is super friendly and talkative! And location is beautiful and has a very traditional atmosphere! :)"}
{"text":"Considering that this is in the heart of Yorkville, the caliber would be significantly higher, but it is not. I suspect it has to do with the price points. 

As one always gets what one pays for, it is the location (convenience after a hectic day of shopping for instance) I suspect is the draw along with the various patios the restaurant offers. 

Food wise, I was disappointed. I still recall that a decade ago, this to me was at least a 4-star establishment. Today, the octopus was like eating mush, the pasta selection lacked a seafood component while the meat sauce offering was just so average that if I had to, my son could have made better. 

The salmon lacked the wild flavouring that was expected, but know what? We made it there at 5:30pm, well before the evening rush because they don't accept reservations. The awning was out to shield the setting sun while the air conditioning was humming. [As an aside, a group was seated beside us where the woman requested the windows to be opened; thus, altering the humidity and comfort level for everyone. I was disappointed that management catered to one at the expense of all. I suspect she look more handsome than me, or the boyfriend may have slipped a tip before hand. Oh well - such as life, beautiful people get what they want!]"}
{"text":"We came here because the smoking smell was so bad at the restaurant patio that we wanted to eat at...so that was the upside to this restaurant, no smoking, and their upstairs patio was cozy. But overall, wow this has got to be the most disappointing restaurant in Yorkville. The service was bad and while the food was okay, not for the price for sure. We ordered the caprese salad and ravioli and for both, I could make far far better at home."}
{"text":"To be frank, this would be a 4-star situation if the prices were 25% lower, but this place presents itself as top-shelf Italian. There's no room for error in that market. \"Mediocre Italian\" is practically an oxymoron. The carpaccio is nicely flavored, but you need to be careful around the seafood options. The service is excellent. Whatever you do, get the mushroom fettuccine."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything on the menu is delicious. Especially the lamb risotto and kale salad. All salads are great."}
{"text":"Really liked it. And a bit surprised I did. Dropped in one Thursday after work to take my two adult kids for dinner. Got a spot right away. Service was friendly and quick. Decided a friend would join us - no problem for them to accommodate us. Again a bit surprised. They handled it all and integrated his timing into our timing of Drinks and food really well. Food was great. 
I guess surprised because as an old standard of Yorkville and a busy one that o haven't been to in about 6 years - it over came my preconceived notion that it was going to be a disappointment like some other well known Yorkville standards. 
Go try it out !"}
{"text":"Such a charming place had to make a spot after stuffing myself with sushi that I had in the area.  After walking inside the waiter treated us very well. We only came for some drinks so we end up with a glass of roccanivo ($20.99 /glass) it was a quite pricey. But one was just enough. Tasted good. I also got a fruity sangria.  Unfortunately I was too full to grab a dish to try.  Will definitely come back to try the dishes they have to offer."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Nervosa. Its definitely my go-to place to eat during lunch in Yorkville. My personal favourite is their spinach salad and their seafood pasta (forgot the Italian name for it). The only downside to this restaurant is that its so small. Tables are barely separated and I was never able to have a decent conversation with my girlfriend ever here. However, the food and the price makes up for it so I don't complain much."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try to this restaurant a while ago ever since seeing a picture of their pasta on social media. 

Definitely lived up to expectations! I had their Mafalde ai Funghi pasta, which was what I hoped to try and also recommended by our server. The \"al dente\" texture of the pasta was what stood out the most. The \"light cream sauce\" was a bit heavy in my opinion, but portion was just about right. Included in the dish was several different types of mushrooms: portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place to dine. Love their pizza and their mafalde ai funghi! I've been there many times however recently was more special, I had few guests from Italy and they had great time there... enjoyed chatting with our hostess in Italian and she even brought us amaro to finish our night more special!"}
{"text":"This review relates to a dining experience we had here on July 24.  Have previously been here, to the cute rooftop patio, and experience has been fine.  However, July 24 I was with a group of six for a gf's bday on a sunny Sunday evening.  We were seated on the main floor just to the right of the door.

Shortly after we were seated, a restaurant employee tripped and sent a 24 box of sparkling waters in large glass bottles flying down the stairs.  Since we were seated closest to the stairs, the glass shattered and went flying hitting my leg and my hand and cutting me in the process.  The waiter came to take our order and the girls pointed out that I was bleeding.  He brought me some band aids but did not apologize nor did anyone ask if I was okay.

We proceeded to order and have our meal.  Part way through the meal, another server dropped a tray stacked w glasses and bottles right next to our table.  The glass shattered and flew onto the table yet again and onto us.  Luckily, no one was cut this time. We all stopped eating in case there was any glass in our food.  Again, no one apologized.

Needless to say, we were appalled by the frequent smashing of glass, the cut, and most of all, the total lack of concern from the establishment!  Would not dine here again, and would not recommend it to anyone.  Would give zero stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"When I was at UofT I'd often pass Cafe Nervosa while strolling through Yorkville and be amused by their outdoor seating.  But not once did I stop in.  Now that I've come back for a visit, I decided to hit up the place for the first time.

There are two floors - we sat on the first level.  The place was slightly cramped but not uncomfortable.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive even though she was one of few serving the entire floor.

And the food - yum!  I got the insalate caprese with burrata which was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  Then I had the rigatoni alla nonna which had spicy tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, and eggplant.  J got the prosciutto and then a pasta dish with sausage and enjoyed both.  They have a decent wine list and their mojito hit the spot on a night when I really needed a drink.  

The bathrooms are cute except one stall was broken (I'll leave it at that).  It also looked like they had a second patio upstairs.  The indoor decor is interesting/cute/cooky with plenty of reliefs against the wall and photographs lining the stairways."}
{"text":"this is one of my Go to place in yorkville..
food is good and service is good..
i always seem to order some kind of salad and bruschetta with mushrooms or sometimes pizza, but all and all food is consistent and atmosphere is cozy..
my tip is to sit upstaris if possible.. much quieter and cozier..:)"}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant in the heart of Yorkville. It's the cutest restaurant with the nicest patio overlooking Yorkville. We came here on Mother's day and surprisingly, there was only a 5-10 minute wait.
The weather was gorgeous so we decided to sit on the patio. We started off with some drinks. I had the red wine sangria which was is my absolute favourite.
As for the meal, I ordered the kale salad and a side of grilled calamari. I truly mean it when it say this is TO DIE FOR. Definitely a must-try if you visit this place!
We also shared the grilled octopus which was fantastic. I loved the variety of sauces that came with it (chimichurri, tapenade, piquillo puree).
100% will return to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their romantic atmosphere and delicious food. I don't like that they don't take reservations. Every time I go there I have a positive experience. They have the most delicious salad I have ever had: Pollo e Formaggio I highly recommend it. Just thinking about it makes me want to go there. Service is good: attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Very popular spot but for good reason.

The mafalde ai funghi is always spot on here.  It's very rich with a good bite to the pasta itself.  Lots of different types of mushroom add lots of flavour to the dish.  The truffle oil drizzle is a nice accent.

The atmosphere here is very cozy and intimate in the evening and hustle-bustle family dining during the days.  

Service is excellent here and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a recent trip to Toronto between meals. She said she finds this place to be consistently good. It has a warm inviting atmosphere and its patios provide great views of the  charming Yorkville neighbourhood. We started with aperol spritz and our drinks were boozy and delicious. We ate meatballs and a Calamarata con Gamberi pasta. The meatballs were melt in your mouth good. My friend found the pasta to be a bit undercooked yet very good. The service was friendly and we had a great time. I will return for a full meal next time."}
{"text":"I read some good reviews about that place, so decided to give it a shot. We've been to many many Italian restu's, and this is by far, the worst!!!!
Food: Lacks taste! Pizza was aweful, it had like 20 grams of cheese..and a lot of olives... and the dough was almost wet - I couldnt carry the slices with my hand!!
Pasta was undercooked, and had no sauce!! It was a shrimp pasta, it had exactly 3 pieces of shrimp and a pile of uncooked pasta dough!!!
Besides, it is over over noisy! Its an Italian restaurant, it is supposed to be quiet!!!
I choose one of the wines on the menu - and even that was bad!

Would never consider going back there!!"}
{"text":"WOW, I'm really sorry that I didn't listen to what yelpers were saying about this place. I decided to try it regardless since it has been on my to try list for a long time. 

Coming in, it is a very tiny little establishment. Seating downstairs is for a max of 30 people. All of the tables are 2 person seaters but are pushed together when a larger group comes in*. 

The noise level is up there. It's very loud and a little bit distracting. If you wanted to come here for a nice evening with a loved one, well you may have to talk a bit louder because the walls are reflecting every other conversation going on in the room. 

The bathrooms were *gasp* upstairs and were old looking with wooden panelling but at least they were clean and lit brightly. There was also another room upstairs for dining, I'm not sure if you come up here to separately wait or if they usher you up if there is seating available.

I'm not too sure if this place is family style serving, though most small places are but our initial server that took drink orders and our food orders happened to disappear after we placed our order. And yes it was busy but there were only 4 other tables that really needed attending to and there was a second server. Most of the time I found our server over by the computer screen punching things in or just furrowing his brows. He never once came over to check how our food was, and he didn't even ask someone else to ask how everything was. Ah, the disappearing act, so I assume that he's going to show up lovely when the bill comes.

Food was decent. Nothing spectacular but not special. It was good. I had the bucatini bolgnese which was very good, the meat was made of veal and beef. The noodles (bucatini - thick tube like noodles) were dense but worked well with the sauce but if I ever get this again, I think I'll ask to substitute the noodles for linguini. I had the banada tiramisu for dessert, which was...lack luster. The bananas were hard, I initially thought that there were nuts in the tiramisu but it just turned out to be raw bananas, not impressed. I was impressed with the presentation of the dessert, in a individual short square vase with a gooseberry and mint garnish. 

When it came time to finish things up, our waiter still had not arrived. The busboy was the one clear our dishes and get my tea and dessert menus (which we had to ask for) and then we had to call over someone to take our order. After I finished dessert, it was time for the bill, so of course the disappearing act would end, correct? Negative! I still had not seen our original server come by. We asked the busboy (again) for our bill and paid. I honestly think we overpaid since we left a $10 tip for a $69 bill but we just wanted to get the heck out of there.

Everything took long. We could've been out of that restaurant 20 minutes earlier if we had not been waiting to get a dessert menu, waiting to order dessert, waiting to ask for our bill. So when did our original server show up? AFTER we had gotten the bill and it had been collected (again by the busboy), \"Oh do you need the bill?\" No thanks, we already overpaid for your shit service.

The food was decent, but the service was shit. Not likely to return as the food wasn't great enough for me to endure that crappy service again, it's too bad because it could've become a go-to spot for a quick meal, but again service was bad and a little bit too pricey for the quality.

{"text":"Excellent restaurant for any occasion or a with no occasion at all. Make sure to order the kale salad and whatever fish they have on special. It's the restaurant that's so simple it's impressive when all the fancy players fail"}
{"text":"The red sangria was good and I really enjoyed my rucola salad. Wish my server asked for where I wanted to sit (the patio) rather than simply seating me anywhere she saw fit."}
{"text":"Visited with a group of co-workers before an event in Yorkville.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience. 

We were hoping to sit out on the patio (it was really nice out!) but there wasn't room for our group of 5 people so we were seated inside upstairs. Side note, the stairs on the way up to the second level are super tight and probably slightly hard to navigate after having a couple of drinks and/or wearing high heels.

We ordered bread for the table (delicious!) along with a pitcher of red sangria (delightful!) and the mushroom bruschetta (very yummy!). For my main, I opted for the Calamarata con Gamberi - which was house made short pasta with wild shrimp, tomato sauce, cherry tomato, chilies, marjoram, parsley. Super tasty and I finished my whole plate!! Loved the tender shrimp plus the spicy tomato sauce, so good!

We were too stuffed to try dessert but I will have to come back next time to try!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and meatballs and very good service. Our waiter recommended a great wine and it enhanced our dining experience. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic atmosphere, and fantastic second floor (heated) patio! Great wine lists and 1/2 L options!! Service has always been great when I've been there! Definitely one of my Yorkville favourites!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, but their olive oil is amazing, I've never tried an olive oil so tasty. I had a kale salad with pine nuts which was pretty good. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 stars it's because I think the service wasn't great."}
{"text":"Located off the corner of Belair and Yorkville, this place serves decent food and has a cute patio up top, but the poor service will leave the worst taste in your mouth. We all know that you can have a good meal and enjoy it, but once you deal with staff that rubs you the wrong way, it makes the entire experience a bad one and no amount of delicious food (unless INCREDIBLY amazing) is worth it, and my friend, the food isn't good enough to make up for that.

I've been here a few times and the first couple of times we came for dinner on the patio. But man, this was our last time... It was such a bad experience. Probably the worse customer service we've received in a long time.

First off, the staff is unattentive and if you try to make a reservation, you're wasting your time. We had to call 4x. The first time we called a month in advanced for seating for 2 and they said we should call 2 weeks before the date. So, we call 2 weeks before that and they said they couldn't make a reservation for 2, so we'd have to speak to the reservations group/person. We finally get ahold of the reservations person and when we gave them a date, they asked what day (In reservations, don't u have a calendar? I just gave a specific date). Then they said they don't take reservations after 6pm on weeknights. They said there wouldn't be a problem walking in late in the evening for 9pm.

So we finally walk in to eat and the service is horrible.  We order a chicken salad, a pizza and a few drinks to start. The food was not bad, but the staff is unattentive and pushy. They didn't fill up my water or ask if we wanted more drinks. I asked for water, the waiter forgot to bring it to me, so I had to ask again. They never checked to on us during dinner, which is a pain when you really need something like cutlery and you don't have it and your hungry with food is sitting in front of you, but wait 40 minutes to arrive. So disappointing. 

If you want to go, don't bother:
1) Booking any reservation or event
2) Bringing a date 
3) Celebrating an occasion
4) Or expect good service"}
{"text":"Reliable place for a nice Italian lunch in Yorkville. One of my favorite dishes on the menu is the very good Nicoise salad, although they give it an Italian name - insalate di tonna or something like that. Anyway, it's very good. The pizzas are also quite good - thin crust, with good cheese and sauce.

It's a busy place but the staff takes care of everyone in a timely fashion.

Recommend: The gorgeous patios in the summer. Get there early on a nice sunny day. 
The inside is not as nice as they pack the tables really tightly together. Yesterday at lunch one of the waiters kept bumping my chair which wasn't so comfortable. If you don't like being crowded, go somewhere else. Ditto if you don't want noise."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Nervosa we were getting pizza take away so we didn't dine in and have a full experience. If you live in the area I highly recommend a video from Bay St video and pizzas from Nervosa. :)

My friend was a vegetarian and the staff were very friendly and helpful with recommendations and making substitutions. He had the funghi e formaggi (mushroom pizza) minus proscuitto and it was delicious. The cipolline onions and gorgonzola were a perfect combination with the mushrooms. 

I had the Montanara; sausage, roasted peppers, and onions. All delicious again with gorgonzola, yum!

All in all it was a great pizza experience. The crust was thin and crispy, even with a 5 minute walk home. And you could really taste the quality in the ingredients. The pizzas were about $16 each which is quite reasonable for that level of quality. Especially now that many pizza places are using cheaper and cheaper ingredients.

Since then I've also been for dinner on their upstairs patio, which is heated so it's was fine even on a cool fall evening. The patio is also well worth a visit for the ambience and to people watch.

The pasta, like the pizzas, were well-prepared, quality ingredients, better than most but pretty classic Italian flavors and combinations.

A great place for a consistently good meal in Yorkville."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered pasta dishes, both were really good, especially the one with the wild mushrooms.  Very nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Had a pizza and a pasta mushroom dish. Both tasted great and filled us up. The price was also decent. 

But there's nothing too special about this place. If you're looking for the best Italian food I'm sure there's a lot better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have been a regular for years and love the food, but boy is it ever time for a renovation.  The place is looking gross and at this stage I will only go when I know I can sit on the patio because the thought of being on that second level inside icks me out.  Come on Nervosa - your menu rocks and you are an anchor of the Yorkville scene - don't get lazy on us!"}
{"text":"In the past i have always had good things to say about Nervosa but today i was extremely underwhelmed. Staff were very slow, inattentive. The water they served was hot, no ice. Nothing can be worse on a hot day when you are eating on a patio. We had to keep asking for ice. I am not trying to nit pick here but the table and chairs were kind of awkward. Both of us were really uncomfortable. 

When the food came it was quite good. No complaints there but by that time we were already pretty annoyed. 

I will give them another chance at some point but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you are in Yorkville area, this is a nice place to check out. I've been here a few times throughout the years. 

In the summer, its especially nice because they have a small patio on the top floor and one on the ground floor outside their restaurant. Because of the location, you might spot a few celebs as well. I spotted an actress from a TV series on Showcase here. Even Beyonce and Jay-Z were spotted dining here while in Toronto a few years ago. If its good enough for Queen B, it should be worth checking out right? lol. 

Celebrities aside, this place makes a nice spot in you are in the area. I tend to order from their pizza options and split that with a friend. They make their pizzas thin crust. Good for families, friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"Really felt like having fish but it was Friday's special so chose the mushroom pasta instead.  And what a pleasant surprise it was.  So creamy and the mushrooms were plentiful and substantial.  Didn't miss the meat at all.  My one complaint was it was too noisy to have a conversation with my friends."}
{"text":"I came here with two girlfriends for one of their birthdays. Made a reservation which was honoured-a good thing too since it was slamming busy on a Wednesday evening!

The food was yummy. I got a salad with chicken and goat cheese and my friends ordered pasta. I forget the exact orders but it was a couple months ago so the menu may have been updated anyways.

The food was very yummy and filling. We ordered a seafood appetizer and were trying not to fight over the last bite which was one of those awkward situations where everyone wants to grab it but also wants to live up to expected decorum at a yorkville restaurant. My salad was great, the chicken was a bit cumbersome and although I had requested the dressing to be on the side it came on the salad. No big deal, I still really enjoyed it.

I would give this place 4 stars if not for the extremely crampped seating. Sometimes it's awkward to have a conversation with about 10 people in earshot! But maybe I'm a bit too anti-social.

All in all a nice place that I wouldn't hesitate to return to, but won't make any special trips for."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this trattoria. Very affordable for the kind of food they offer. Decent size plates and staff was kind and efficient. Its a small place, very packed, no a lot of privacy or intimacy but very charming."}
{"text":"Short rib beef risotto was actually so delicious, my knife sliced through that beef like butter, and the buttery truffle mushroom risotto was an intoxicating combination. chianti was superb, bufala invernale was absolutely perfect, perhaps a bit too small of a portion but the combination hit the spot. The dessert selection was underwhelming especially the Canoli however, all in all a very good experience I would definitely return. I give it 4.5 stars if the option was available"}
{"text":"Trattoria Nervosa, as in Nervous lol.
Is a popular Italian restaurant located in the heart of Yorkville.
Inside this Victorian style home with an outdoor patio, main floor and steep steps to the second floor, Nervosa focuses on fresh ingredients in Italian cuisine.
Our entourage came here for a coworkers farewell.  
Their menu provides a great selection of pastas, salads and meats from the grill.
Keep in mind their prices are slightly higher due to the area, which can be absurd to some of my Italian coworkers. 
As for food I ordered their popular Malde al Funghi, a mushroom based creamy pasta.  Keep in mind I eat with my eyes and their presentation was not the greatest.  It looked like they just threw my pasta on the dish quickly and served it.  However it made up in flavor, rich, creamy, melody of flavors unified by the truffle oil drizzled all over.

Overall the atmosphere is cute and cozy with a romantic feel.  Service was great and overall experience was okay."}
{"text":"Cafe Nervosa is frozen in time - circa 1997. The decor, style of food, waitress uniforms, and best of all music is stuck in the late 1990s. Food is quite good, but not amazing. Servings are a good size. One of the better restaurants in a generally boring and highly overrated neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch and dinner, and it has been busy (and noisy!) every time. I've always come with one other person, and have been put in the tiniest table wedged in the middle of the restaurant, in between other groups and couples. Aside from this awkward and slightly uncomfortable seating, the food is always amazing- I always get the cavolo nero (kale salad) and mafalde ai funghi (mushroom pasta), and it is ALWAYS delicious. Tastes exactly like the one at Gusto 101."}
{"text":"Everything was disappointing. 

The location is nice and it has a nice ambience on the rooftop terrace, but the food is horrible. 

Luckily I was with a group, so I got to try 4 different dishes before making my judgment. 

I tried the fettucini Bolognese, the sauce tasted like unseasoned tomato paste. even the fettucini wasnt cooked properly. we had 2 orders of the mafalde ai funghi and both plates had no salt. so bad. seasoning your food is one of the most basics things any chef should know. the pizza and the salad were just average. 

not the place you should visit if you want decent italian food."}
{"text":"I love the upstairs patio of this restaurant. 
It's nicely decorated and for a moment you forget you are in Toronto. The service has always been good and the food it's quite tasty as well. Nice place to sit down on an afternoon with a glass of wine"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Family Day dinner at this quaint little Italian restaurant. Started off with a large basket of bread that was so fresh and delicious. I had the pumpkin ravioli with a brown butter sauce, crisped sage and pine nuts. It was the best pasta I have had in a very very long time. My husband and daughter had the pizza. The crust was amazing, sauce was simple and tasty.  Overall it was a fantastic pizza. 
Our wait staff was very efficient and friendly and straight from Italy.  
We ate upstairs and although it is very small and there is not a lot of room to move around, I didn't mind it at all. 
I will definitely be back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Imagine that it is 9pm on a Friday night in Toronto, and the majority of the city's most coveted restaurants aren't taking reservations. You have tickets for a show at 10pm, and you don't have much time to spend waiting in the queue with other starving patrons. What do you do? Do you risk showing up late to your show in hopes of satisfying your tummy, or do you opt-in for other restaurants with a quicker table turnover? In our case, we (regrettably) opted for the latter. 

While this Yorkville restaurant boasts a beautiful rooftop patio and multi-leveled dining room, the food selection and quality at Trattoria Nervosa pale in comparison to its wonderful ambiance. Even with the kind and courteous servers who are relentlessly charming their guests with their smiles, I just couldn't summon enough energy to love the food.

So, what exactly did I order? I tried the Montanara pizza, which was topped with berkshire sausage, gorgonzola dolce, roasted red peppers, and red onions. The good thing was that we had the pizza on our table in a very timely manner. However, I wasn't too impressed with the sporadic clumps of onions and peppers, which were submerged in a cavalcade of sausage. In the future, I'd suggest that the kitchen staff better diffuse the toppings across the pizza so as to maintain some consistency in its taste. I also washed down the dryness of the pizza with a Peroni, which is the quintessential beer of Italy.

All in all, my experience at Trattoria Nervosa was \"meh.\" I sincerely hope this restaurant improves the culinary experience for its patrons, as it has A LOT of potential. For now, your safest bet with this restaurant is to enjoy a beverage on its patio with an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner a few weeks ago.  Located in Yorkville this TINY restaurant definitely caters to the crowd.

We ordered a few dishes to share - the Polipo dish - grilled octopus ($18).  I was DELICIOUS.  Tender and not overly salty - melt in your mouth.  

This restaurant tends to get packed - it's loud and a bit claustrophobic.  It gets annoying that you constantly have to scoot your chair in to let people pass or be careful about not hitting your neighbor or try to eat on tiny tables.  That is my one overall annoyance about any restaurant.

The service was nice and it does have that fun/loud vibe - definitely not for a intimate dinner - you can't hear the person across from you.  If that's the vibe you are going for then don't come here."}
{"text":"It's really hard to like this place even though they have great pizza.... and I LOVE my pizza.

This is the kind of spot that relies heavily on location, location, location. Upon first glance Cafe Nervosa seems like a charming and romantic date spot with reasonable prices in the haute trenches of Yorkville. Walking up to this yellow building there was a line forming outside the door on a very cold night. Good sign. I walked in asked how long the wait would be, 5mins. Another good sign. The clientele was ordering copious amounts of food, there was a private party happening upstairs, and they let me browse the menu without giving me a weird look. More good signs.

After a 20minute wait (acceptable) and getting seated close to the door when there was a banquette available the charm was starting to wear off. The interior is incredibly small, with a high ceiling, white walls, pot lights, wood and wire chairs and table cloth covered tables. The chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable but I still looked forward to the meal as I hear good things of this place. The space is incredibly loud as the shape of the room amplifies everyone's conversations.

Service was absolutely dismal. The server never greeted us and barely paid any attention. I repeated my order twice and when I said I needed time with the wine list I was scoffed at and he abruptly turned around and walked away without saying a single word or offering water for the time being. After 15 minutes of trying to wave down the server I placed my order. Throughout the service, or lack there of, I was neglected and felt as if I needed to beg in order to get a passing glance. The bus boy cleaning up was easily more attentive than my server as he ended up fetching me more bread and grabbing me some more water and wine since my server felt no need to pay attention.

The food is good. Great thin crust pizza with zesty tomato sauce and the right amount of toppings and cheese. The pastas have great balance and flavor. The food is very tasty and I like it a lot. Simple Italian cooking executed with just enough flare to elevate all the flavors. 

Overall, I was greatly disappointed by Cafe Nervosa. The food is good quality and the flavors pop. The service and atmosphere killed it as the more neglected I was by my server the more I began to see the other faults of the restaurant. In the tail end of my meal I ended up flagging down a server that wasn't mine and he was incredibly hospitable and nice. Maybe I had a one off experience but it has left a sour taste in my mouth. I may come back for a pie during lunch when it's not too busy but I will think twice before ever going for dinner again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Italian places in the city.  It looks small, but with the added seating on the second level (indoor and outdoor) and the outdoor patio, can handle a suite of visitors.

The ambiance is friendly and casual, bright with character accents that allow the food to stand out.  And stand out it does.

Pizzas and pastas taste fresh and delicious, with some classic standards (Margerita pizza, spaghettini bolognese) and other favourites.  It takes me awhile to select what I want to eat off of this menu: I've tried much of it and never had a complaint.  In fact, most of the time I'm swooning over how delicious my pasta is.

The wine list is fine, with table wines that are fairly light and able to be paired with most dishes. Service is attentive, and if you're in the main dining area, you can watch the cooks prepare your meal.

I have not tried their desserts - admittedly, I'm always too full by the end of my meal.  That being said, I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Trattoria Nervosa is chic casual authentic Italian restaurant in Yorkville, Toronto. It neighbours several trendy boutique shops like Anthropologie, Pink Tartan which also carries Want Essentiels and Uncle Otis Clothing. The restaurant itself has two floors with a beautiful patio space upstairs and on the street level. I love the upstairs dining room space. It is very cozy.

Nervosa Toronto is like a breath of fresh air compared to Buca on Kings West. The service at Nervosa is friendly and attentive. And let's not forget how amazing the food actually tastes!

We came here for lunch before we started our day shopping in downtown Toronto. Everything on the menu sounded amazing. We optioned to share three dishes. We always like to share food to sample more variety and because we are greedy. Eating one dish alone never seems right.

Caprese Invernale 15.99: buffalo mozzarella, roasted heirloom tomatoes, chestnut and pine-nut pesto, baby kale, arugula, black olive gravel balsamic reduction, drizzle with Nervosa organic olive oil. Fresh.

Prosciutto e Rucola Pizze 17.99: Tomato sauce based pizza topped with fresh mozzarella, San Daniele prosciutto arugula, shaved parmigiano 17.99

Mafalde ai Funghi 18.49: A medley of mushroom spores - portobello, oyster mushrooms, porcini mushrooms, crimini mushrooms parmigiano, and truffle paste in a light cream sauce. What is amazing about this pasta is it not overwhelmingly rich. The truffle paste is not over-powering and you can still taste the differences in all the mushrooms. 

It is probably one of the best funghi mushroom pasta I've had in a very long time. The delicious mushroom sauce simply hugged the curly nature of the perfectly cooked al dente Mafalde ribbon pasta.

There's a reason why every time we come to Toronto, we always come visit Nervosa. Come before noon during the weekdays to ensure a good seat. The lunch crowd can get quite busy.

Nervosa Trattoria, always a pleasure!"}
{"text":"I couldn't have asked for a better place to host my birthday dinner! The food was unbelievably amazing!! The funghi pasta and asiago melted cheese are to die for. My only concern with this place was the arrogant waiter we had. He created a big fuss about splitting our bill even though we had mentioned to him in the beginning that we would want that. We even had another waiter exclaim 'Bill splitting isn't our job, you should figure it out yourself!' 

I would've given this restaurant 5 stars for its impeccable food, but was thrown off by the waiters."}
{"text":"Very often your experience of a restaurant is shaped by what you order.

Here's what I recommend: The polipo, archtic char, and margherita pizza."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad, but what really did it for me was the service.

During my entire dining experience there, I felt a bit shafted by my server. We almost never got checked on about how everything was going, we never were given bread like all of the other tables, and I had to go out of my way to get the servers attention. Our server barely even spoke to us at all.

We had ordered the Bruschetta ai Funghi to start, which wasn't bad, but the price was a little steep for what you got. There were three pieces of Bruschetta covered in mushrooms, cheese, and balsalmic. Nothing special.

I got the Malfalde ai Funghi as a main, which was pretty good. The pasta is not too rich despite it's cream sauce, and the flavor of the different mushrooms really came through. Only disappointment was that it was undersalted.

Overall, the food was pretty good, but it's hard to enjoy a meal when the service is really lacking. I hope this was just a one-off thing."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I have to say, I'm always impressed with the food. They do the BEST grilled octopus I've ever had. It's a favourite dish of mine, and if I see it on a menu, I'll usually order it. I don't know what they do to it here that makes it so fantastically tender, but whatever it is they do, it works! 

Their mushroom pasta (Mafalde ai Funghi) is also the best I've had. So tempting to want to order this every time, but I really want to try more items on their menu. Their pizzas look incredible, so I'll be trying one on my next visit for sure. 

On my most recent visit, I had the kale salad (Insalata di Cavolo Nero) and was very light tasting. The currants and pine nuts really work in this dish. Just a hint of sweetness amidst the tartness of the lemon vinaigrette. Really good! Had to have some of their red sangria, too. Perfect summer drink. 

The first time I came here, I wasn't overly impressed with the service, but it's definitely improved since then. 

Also, their house bread is fantastic. Fresh from their oven, it's definitely worth getting a basket for the table. I don't think they used to charge for the bread, but they do now. In any case, if you like bread, get it! I think this is my new favourite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I loved the location, the ambiance, and the food. I had dinner there with my family and I'm looking forward to a second opportunity. The pizza was fantastic. Baked in the stone oven and thin crusty dough."}
{"text":"I dined at Trattoria Nervosa on a Friday evening and luckily grabbed a table without waiting. They do have queues and do not take reservations, so be ready to wait for a table. 

To my disappointment, they did not turn on air conditioning on such a hot summer day and the upper level was hot and uncomfortable. This dining experience would have been significantly better should there have been air conditioning. 

I ordered the beef tenderloin carpaccio which tasted cooked and dry. The rigatoni pasta is cooked on the al dente side, the sauce has a bit of acidity and there is a generous portion of veal and beef. Their Mafalde Ai Funghi pasta with truffle pasta was fragrant and creamy, and I would recommend this one."}
{"text":"I visit Cafe Nervosa on the regular.

I always take my mom here when she comes for a visit and have gone here with friends as well. Basically, my decision making process is as follows - I don't want to wander too far from home and Yorkville is ridiculously priced overall. Cafe Nervosa is not cheap, but it is reasonable. 

My mom and I got delicious hand marinated olives, the arugula salad , a pizza with artichokes and olives, and two beer. It was more than enough food for two people and came to about $40. The food was good (I normally hate ordering salad at a resto, but it was worth it) and the price was right considering the yuppie location."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian restaurant in Yorkville. Its definitely the go-to restaurant whenever my best friend and I can't decide where to go for dinner. 

Their short rib truffle risotto is by far our favourite. At least one of us will get it each time we come! The portion size is so generous that it takes two of us to finish. The short ribs are cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. The risotto has a strong truffle flavour and is so creamy and cheesy. 

This time we also got the mushroom pasta. This too smelled strongly of truffle, but the taste wasn't as strong as the risotto. The mushroom medley blended well with the pasta and it was a solid dish overall. 

The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the service. It seems hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get a waiter that seems disinterested in serving us, which substantially takes away from our dining experience. 

Will definitely return next time with my friend!"}
{"text":"My bro in law and I intended to bring our little ones to a kid specific restaurant, but it was packed. When the littlest one started yammering for food, we ran to Nervosa.

Very impressed with the way the staff handled us...they didn't show any annoyance (in fact, they were lovely)  and accommodated a request for a plain avocado (which the chef cut beautifully and drizzled with olive oil), and a few other non menu items. It was not at all a slow day, btw.

The adults enjoyed the rucola salad, prosciutto pizza, and an aperol spritz on the upstairs deck. Oh, and they even brought maraschino cherries for my daughters San pelligrino. Somehow we had a chic and enjoyable lunch while caring for toddlers. Bravo, Nervosa!"}
{"text":"We were craving the Mafalde di Funghi from Gusto 101 but that was far away. So we decided to hit up Nervosa for this specific pasta. 

We ordered the bread the grilled octopus to share. The octopus was fantastic the multi drops of citrus sauce, chimichurri was great with the fresh and tender octopus tentacles. 

However, the disappointment came with the pasta. The pasta stripes arrived hard and cold, but I do see the porcini and sauce hot with steam. After tasting it, I realize the dish wasn't executed right. The pasta was probably pre-cooked or took out from the pot for too long they got cold. When al-dente pasta gets cold, they tend to become harder than expected. The portion also was smaller than gusto 101. It was quite a let down to be served cold pasta at Nervosa."}
{"text":"I felt like I was dining in someone's house:)  This place had a very unique feel to it.  The ambiance was very positive and it was crowded for a Sunday.  I think the patio upstairs is a popular spot to eat your meal if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Trattoria Nervosa this month.

The atmosphere is really nice if you enjoy the bustle of the city around you.  There is a patio but it is very close to the sidewalk, so we opted to sit indoors. 

I had the Rapini e Salsicce which is a white pizza (no tomato sauce).  It was the perfect balance of salty sausage and bittersweet rapini, and high quality mozza.  My husband had the Mafalde ai Funghi, which was like a super high end Cream of Mushroom pasta, made with fresh assorted mushrooms.  The food was really outstanding. 

In terms of value for money, I would say it's a tad on the expensive side in terms of portions - then again, you recognize you are paying for rent when you dine in Yorkville.  The service is the main reason why it was 4/5 for me - very inpersonal and seemed like a robot."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, albeit the seating is very very cramped.

Went there with a group of 4 friends, luckily we got a table right away. The server was very friendly and professional. We had an assortment of pastas, pizza and the Arctic char special.  Everyone polished the places.

For dessert we had the pistachio cream brule, delicious! However the chocolate molten cake was a bit too salty, they did tell us it had sea salt...still it was a bit too salty.

Overall no complaints! Delicious and ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food
Nice atmosphere !
When we got there, it was around 6:00 PM and was able to get a table without waiting too long 
I guess we got lucky, Especially because it's a Saturday, 
but after 6 o'clock there is a lineup for sure, but I see why!
Definitely worth the hype
I took my husband here for his birthday
And I'm So glad we did
Best to try there pizza and mushroom pasta!
It's total wow factor!
We will be coming here again and will recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Been here two times for dinner within the last couple of months and I love the Mafaldi ai Funghi pasta. I am a huge fan of truffle and its a hard one to cook with because it can be fickle but they do it perfectly. I've also sampled a few of the other appetizers and mains as I was with groups both times.  I'd heard that there is a new chef on the roster and though I'm not sure how it was before, it's damn good now. There's a lemon cream desert you just have to try as well as a flourless chocolate torte that is to die for. The only thing I didn't care for was the bread, but on the plus side you won't fill up on it before your main. 

Overall I will be back and would recommend it to others. The prices are reasonable when compared to the quality of food and location in the city, and it is definitely a busy place, so you'll want to make a reservation."}
{"text":"From start to finish the whole experience was amazing.  From one of the best spaghetti puttanesca dishes I've ever had to a nice and hot cup of velvety espresso, I felt back as if I was back in Sicily.  Good food plus excellent staff made for a great night."}
{"text":"One of my fave Italian resto's in Yorkville!

Have come here a couple times for lunch with coworkers.  The service is fairly fast and a morning-of reservation is sufficient on weekdays.  The place is PACKED every time I went, even for lunch on the odd Monday or Thursday.  It's quite small and I was seated on the first floor both times, not sure how the second floor looks like but hopefully will get to sit up there next time I go

Spaghetti alla Chitarra con Vongole e Gamberi: little neck clams, Tiger shrimp, white wine, fresh tomato, chilies - I thought the clams were sauced with too much vinegar - or rather, the white wine they chose wasn't exactly to my liking.  The spaghetti itself was delicious and the shrimp was cooked well too.  A very satisfying meal.  
Fettuccine alla Bolognese: veal and beef ragout, shaved parmigiano - I had this the first time I went, and I liked this dish for its meatiness compared to the other pastas offered :P  The parmesan made the dish. 

Two of my coworkers had the Mafalde ai Funghi - which was a pasta dish with a variety of mushrooms and the malfade pasta was especially ribbon-like so it looked to hold more sauces than other types of pasta.  Coworker attested to the creamy deliciousness of the dish and I think I would get this the next time I go back :)"}
{"text":"My number one choice in the Yorkville area. The beef carpaccio was the best I've ever had. And my Funghi pasta was cooked to perfection with plenty of delicious mushrooms. My waitress was great. Very attentive. Service was quick - sometimes I'd like more time between courses but I can't complain about that. The place was packed and everything looked delicious. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food here is good, (Hope my 2 stars doesn't turn people off).  However, I found this place really expensive, and the portion sizes were small.  I did enjoy my food I had the agnolotti and it was tasty.  I was hungry going home however and had to stop in McDonalds :P And I am not a huge eater, I'm average.  Also the tables are really close together which I didn't like.  It was November when I went so it was cold outside and I got seated quite near the door and I was so cold.  It is always really busy, would be nice in the summer to enjoy some wine on the cute patio.  Overall food was good, but that's all I enjoyed of the experience."}
{"text":"This place has great food and service! Got to enjoy their margarita pizza and was extremely pleased with the great quality of food they brought to the table. 

Got to try their sangria which was delicious. Will most definitely be back,probably one of the best restaurants in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"I think this is a cute little place. We got pizza and a dessert to share and both were decent. The service was good and the price is fine considering that it's in Yorkville. I can't say that the food is particularly special but the pizza tasted very fresh (as in the vegetable toppings). The dessert was somewhat disappointing because it didn't look awesome nor did it taste amazing. However, I would come back for their pizza again and maybe a different dessert."}
{"text":"The service was slo0o0o0ow! We were eating upstairs and all ready to order and it took something like 12 minutes for them to come and ask us what we wanted. Because of this, we subtracted a bit from the tip. Perhaps it was because the place was busy? We were seated upstairs and it was definitely packed to capacity. Another slight complaint was how cramped seating was . It wasn't quite packed tight like canned sardines, but moreso like a bunch of pickles floating but not quite touching after being canned. That is to say, there was still some leeway for leg room and moving about and whatnot, but it was still noticeably cramped, and kinda uncomfortable. 

Now to the good points. The complimentary bread was awesome. I enjoyed it very much! They gave you a nice vinegar to dip the bread in. It tasted awesome. For an appetizer we had...MORE BREAD, but with toppings on top. This appetizer was delicious!

Now for the pasta. I forgot the name of the pasta i ordered, but it had a spicy sausage in it. It was a great tasting pasta. (It could have been bolognese) They were very generous with the portions and i left the restaurant stuffed. However i felt the price point was a bit steep considering what I ordered. The pasta was something like 17 dollars, which i found a bit steep for tomato sauce, pasta and meat. I enjoyed the meal though, and immediately after finishing it, i felt all warm and fuzzy like a shetland sweater. For this reason, i would definitely recommend this restaurant for Winter eats!"}
{"text":"Awful awful customer service!! Not organized at all, they have a kid in the front as a hostess! The rude lady wasn't happy with the table that a little girl gave us, and she started yelling at us for that!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum, this place can do no wrong! Everything I've tried on many visits is amazing. It will keep you coming back for more and you might even spot some celebs while you are at it! The upstairs lounge area is amazing. Everything about this place is!
I hightly recommend the spaghetti a la vongole and the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with colleagues and clients.

It was really busy and we were jammed into the front room.  It was really LOUD and surprisingly hot considering it was 16C out (we were sweating!).

I ordered a Contadina pizza ... it was okay.  The outside crust was cooked nicely but it seemed like the crust in the middle wasn't cooked enough.

Everyone seemed happy with their meals."}
{"text":"Just noticed I never finished the review. This is our fourth visit here, had their pizza every time, and every time we were very happy with it. This time...they were already running behind...when our pizza arrived, the steak knife they gave us could not separate the pizza....first warning...the server pointed to me it was pre-cut....just on the edge and then the line disappeared....second warning....he gave me a new knife...still....the pizza almost flew off a few times as I was trying really hard to get them divided....the middle of the pizza was almost paper thin.....but....wet and mushy.....the server told me....even this should have been a simple refire, it's going to be at least 30 minutes because I'll be lined up behind all the orders already in...not pleased at all. Do, we opt to get the Meatball Spaghetti, instead.
Their mushroom pasta, perfect. The lasagna was cooked perfectly, the sauce was perfect. Just perfect.
About 15 minutes after the \"refire\" order was sent in, it arrived. Well, the taste was good, but I think they rushed it....the meatballs were a tad over, but the spaghetti was a tad under.
Their tiramisu was really well put together, as usual. One comment about it....my wife find it just as good, but I find it not set in enough as I find it too liquidy."}
{"text":"Good location and decent customer service. The food was lacking any sort of distinctive taste or anything that may put this Italian joint above the rest. Worth it for the price but there's definitely tons of better options out there that serve better Italian food with a cheaper menu."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our time here. But it was a tad annoying though as I tried to call to reserve and was told they only take reservations till 6pm. So I ended up going early in person. Luckily there was no wait. Service was amazing. Alberto was so nice and patient with our group. He also helped keep my husband's birthday cake in the fridge and added a candle to it. If you bring your own cake & cut it yourself, it's free but if its cut by them, it's $3 a piece. 

I enjoyed the Mafalde ai Funghi (mushroom pasta) tremendously. It might be one of those dishes that will land on my \"What's the last meal you'd like to have before you die?\". It was heavenly and wish I didn't have to finish it. Super good. Don't order anything else and just go with this one. You will NOT regret it. I got to sample the rigatoni but it was plain and boring. Skip that. 

Also tried some of the appetizers. It was way too pricy for the value. The meatballs (only 5 pieces and nothing special) and bruschetta (3 pieces only wtf?! It was just ok. It may look delish in photos but don't be fooled). Our group also had their decaf coffee and said it was amazing. 

Next time, I will only come back here in the summer, hopefully sitting on the patio, tanning in the sun? and eating that mushroom pasta."}
{"text":"Who knew tomato sauce, sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese could become a comforting, savoury, flavourful, immensely delicious dish? 
It is at Trattoria Nervosa. 
Located in the tony neighbourhood of Yorkville, Trattoria is a tiny restaurant with friendly staff and delicious food. Well, I'm basing my review on a lunchtime visit and just on one dish ...but to be fair my friend had a personal pizza that she enjoyed. All good. 
I'm not one for pretentiousness so was a bit apprehensive but the wonderful front-desk host got me seated right away for lunch. 
I saw photos of the Capellini (and the heaping mound of goat cheese) and was sold. 
It's a rich, hearty tomato sauce and the goat cheese is creamy and fantastic. 
The dish packs a punch and it's now my new favourite thing. 
Servers are super friendly - refilling water glasses, answering questions. We never felt rushed at any point. 
Alright. I'm sold on Yorkville now. Except during TIFF. Keep me away from that hubbub, please and thanks."}
{"text":"The kale salad and grilled calamari was simply amazing and extremely filling. I had ordered the calamari as an add on to the salad and was pleasantly surprised with the quantity. The only disappointment was that I didn't receive some bread to snack on while I waited for the main course. I find this to consistently on/off- sometimes I get it sometimes I dont- and it's so delicious that I would be happily munching on it all the time!"}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant that is always crazy busy. And for good reason. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Unexceptional food. Good service.

Came here yesterday, and we were lucky to get seated right away because it got packed very quickly after and people had to wait for a while in the cold. Not fun for them.

This is a pretty narrow and small space, so you're elbow to elbow with folks on either side. 

I had the butternut squash soup which I felt was devoid of flavor. The pumpkin ravioli with sage was quite alright; it was lacking in salt and a certain je ne sais quoi. My friends didn't complain about their food but neither did they exclaim in delight.

The conversations around the table were great. The service was attentive despite the rush hour.

There's way better Italian in the city."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good service. Space is a bit tight.  The risotto I had was fantastic. Prices are okay."}
{"text":"Service is not so good, but the atmosphere makes up for it. Their wine selection is 3/5 and the food is pretty good for the price ( about 4/5) -- I would not dare to say the best that Toronto has. Saying all this, this is still one of my favourite places to go in Yorkville because the atmostphere is great!

Their pizza is delightful."}
{"text":"Came here on Monday for an early dinner, and I was really excited to try the \"Polipo\" dish - grilled octopus, lemon potatoes, chimichurri, tapenade, piquillo puree, arugula, fried capers for $17.99. 

We got there for 5:15pm and there were already quite a few people in the dining room. We were seated promptly and it took about 10 minutes to have someone come over to greet us. We stuck with water and ordered immediately. Once we ordered a waiter came by and practically dropped two plates on our table. He did not say anything, just dropped the plates and walked away. About 10 minutes after that we got our food (my guest ordered the Capellini and she noted how happy she was that the portion was small. Let's just say that she is in the minority re: liking small portions). Once during dinner we were asked how we were enjoying our meal.

In all honesty, I felt terrible for the staff - they looked miserable and not happy to be there. Throughout the entire dinner they were huddled in a corner by the kitchen and every once in a while they would separate to quickly check on their patrons and then quickly returned to the corner. In situations like that you end up feeling like a burden, rather than a guest. 

In sum: The food was delicious, and the ambiance had potential. But the service was lacking and too cold for my liking. Such a shame considering that such great food could be overshadowed by lukewarm service. 

P.S. Apparently Gusto101 has the same menu - so I suggest you go there instead - I hear they put great emphasis on offering good service."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend, was seated promptly despite not having a reservation, though we did come slightly before 12. I had a latte, which was good, though I didn't taste a strong coffee flavour, a bit too milky for my taste. Had a margherita pizza to split, quite good, the spicy oil you can ask for makes the experience though. I ordered the shrimp pasta, a bit spicy, It was good but nothing spectacular. Service was amazing though, never had to look for our server, they were always there just when we needed them. Overall great place, pricing isn't unreasonable either."}
{"text":"I've only been here once! During the summer my girlfriends and I decided to come to this trattoria as two in our group our regulars at this restaurant. This place is situated in Yorkville! It is very cute like many restaurants in Toronto it is a restaurant built into a house. (Corner House, Table 17 and many other restaurants located in Toronto.) 

What I ordered I can't remember the name of the dish that I got but it was a fettuccine and mushroom dinner. As soon as it was brought out it didn't look that appealing however, never judge a book by its cover!! Although it didn't have an amazing presentation (you can view it in my photos) when I put it in my mouth my taste buds were tingling and it was so delicious! My friend recommended this choice and I have to say it was a great decision! 

We also ordered I think a buffalo mozzarella which was also amazing! 

Overall I recommended this place because the pricing was fair and the atmosphere is cute. During the summer we got seated on their balcony overlooking the Yorkville area. We saw many people walking around and driving. Very great place to socialize and sit around! 

 That day I left and also ordered another dinner for my boyfriend which he also enjoyed! 

The only problem I had with this place was the the server was a little slow and that the area because it is built into a house leaves minimal space to move around. So when I got up to use the ladies room I felt like Godzilla in a rat maze. 

However other than that problem I would definitely recommend this place to others! 

- CL"}
{"text":"One of my favourite italian places in Toronto! The service is great and the margherita pizza is amazing! A nice atmosphere for lunch with friends or for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Had the oyster mushroom pasta,  prosciutto pizza, and carpaccio. Price was very fair as well."}
{"text":"If it's good enough for the Beygency then it's good enough for us.  That was our motto as we decided on a place for our group lunch.

We made reservations for their top patio and despite arriving a bit late, they were able to hold our tables for us.

I went with the Caprese salad ($15.99) and while others in our group ordered an assortment of other and pizzas.  

My salad was definitely on the small side.  I'm not a big eater but after I finished, I was left begging a friend for a slice of his pizza...that never happens to me!  I'm usually the one giving food away.  The other salads - Caesar ($10.99) and Kale ($13.99) were also on the small side.  I would say definitely appetizer portion.  Pizzas smelled and tasted pretty good but ofcourse, I was still ravenous after my small salad.

Location-wise, it was great to have a top view looking down on busy Yorkville.  Service was friendly and decent for our group of 8.  Next time though, I'll stick with the pizza option."}
{"text":"Went here in March for a friend's birthday. I wasn't expecting too much, but I was blown away with how delicious the pasta was.  

It's Yorkville, so of course it's a little bit pricey, but the portions are fairly sized and the food is very filling. I ended up taking half of my pasta to go. 

The restaurant itself is very small, but it's decorated well and the lighting is lovely. It feels more intimate than crowded. 

Staff was friendly enough, and our food came in good timing."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant... We will be back again for sure.... Just walked by and it was busy and welcoming.  The staff is friendly it is a little loud because of the set up and the crowd but the food was fantastic, the Chianti wine was wonderful... They are very rightful proud of their organic olive oil..."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we dined here on vacation in Toronto.  Lovely atmosphere.   Excellent service.  Food was devine."}
{"text":"Was here last night with a friend. Stopped by around 8:30. Appalled by the rudeness of the servers (excuse my bad pronunciation but it wasn't nice to roll eyes) but the lady that seated us was very nice. Service needs improvements and it shouldn't have taken us that long to try to get the attention of the waitresses. We had to start waving our hands around to get their attention. We were out by 9:20. I understand that servers were trying to clean up for the night perhaps but it doesn't make sense for them to stop say they'll send someone right away and no one shows up...

Had the mushroom pasta and capellini. Decent. Bread was not offered until we asked. We only knew it was given because my friend went before. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"3 star food, but 4 stars because the patios (they have 2!) are brilliant. Great for watching all the \"beautiful people\". They have a small rooftop patio which is especially cool in the summer. Even the interior is a nice and cozy in the winter time, although the tables are cramped rather closely together.

Service is spotty but has always been reasonably quick when I go at lunch.

The pizzas are A-OK and they have a few salads that are really yum - the chicken & goats cheese one is a great choice.

Reasonable pricing too, considering the Yorkville location. 

Decent wine list with good price range, bottles starting from $30."}
{"text":"Love the food here! The dishes are reliable to satisfy so we keep going back when we don't feel like taking a chance to try a new restaurant. I always go back to the risotto every other time I am there. No complaints there. Their drinks are a little on the pricier side and the quality does not always deliver. The spacing is tight so a small table for two can be very right if you get the wrongness spot. Service is hit and miss, sometimes they adore you other times you feel like uncool kid being ignored."}
{"text":"Came here with my mother & sister after one of my wedding dress fitting. The location is great, right in the heart of Yorkville. Great food and drinks! We sat upstairs as the downstairs was full. Had a wonderful experience.
Came again in September and unfortunately the outside of Yorkville (most of the patios were having this problem that day) was swarmed with bees! We were sitting inside but the windows were all open and had to leave because of the bee infestation. We will definitely return now that the bee-season is gone! :)"}
{"text":"I like their Mafalde ai Funghi paste ($18.49). Everytime I go there, I order this dish. I also tried their seafood pasta, but still like the mushroom's better. It's a bit on the pricey side since it is located in Yorkville. But their pasta is made in house, so I think it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation before going. 
The food is a bit salty but it's a great Italian restaurant in general."}
{"text":"The place definitely has potential, but I was sat upstairs and the space was so cramped. The waiter/waitresses has to squeeze by our table to reach other tables behind me. It was not very comfortable.

Aside from that, the food was quite underwhelming. The pasta I got was overcooked and the sauce tasted like it came from a jar (flavourless). My boyfriend and I said it tasted like Chef Boyardee's :/

I would not be back."}
{"text":"Went on a date here, wasn't extremely busy on a Saturday night. I ordered the Bolognese which was absolutely delicious, however I was a bit disappointed with the portions. Very romantic."}
{"text":"Cute, perfect for lunch, Italian space in Yorkville. My coworker and I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch. We shared a zesty kale salad to start with a glass of red each. I could not get over how adorable and cozy the restaurant cafe was! It felt like I was in a little village in Europe (even though I've never been to Europe)!

I got a butternut squash dish, which was incredibly delectable, with just the right amount of buttery goodness and seasoning. The butternut squash ravioli dish came in about 8 pieces with sage and pine nuts as garnish. So so so good. My coworker had their tomato base sauce spaghetti with goat cheese. She loved hers too. We did sneak a second glass of wine too, we didn't want to leave just yet!

The bill came to about $106, so about $65 each person. Pretty pricey for a weekday lunch, but I imagine dinner here would be very romantic, lively, and worth it!"}
{"text":"Like some other reviewers, I thought that the Kale salad and mafalde ai funghi were delicious... Dont miss out on these if you eat at this restaurant. Even my meatetarian boyfriend couldn't help himself from finishing off half the salad, which was a good blend of zesty, cheesy and sweet (from the currants). Just a warning that the salads are enormous and you probably need two people to finish them off. The funghi pasta was mediocre and actually lukewarm the first time I ordered it.. I probably should've asked for it to be reheated. But I gave it another chance and it was much better the second time. The mushrooms and truffle cream sauce were heavenly, no joke. 

I've also tried the Asiago al forno appetizer - the baked cheese was pretty tasty too.

Servers were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Cooked al dente. Truffle mushrooms added exceptional flavor to the dishes, and our waitress was very tentative. 

Only reason for 4 stars is because there is a curtain that separates the resturant from the small waiting space, which is extremely unsanitary and unpleasant to witness waitresses/waiters bringing food upstairs because often times the food would touch the curtain. If I were seated upstairs, I wouldn't have known this. My suggestion: sit downstairs. Other than that, this place serves really good quality food."}
{"text":"Trattoria nervosa is a favourite of mine, their staple of course being the mushroom pasta, and they know it. 

As we were ordering, the server pretty much took the words out of our mouths, which I don't know if it is a positive or negative thing. Either way the pasta was delicious. 

Even without reservations, I think we only waited about 35 minutes for seats, which, for what I consider top 3 restaurants for pasta in the city, fantastic."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere on a Friday night with candlelight and a full house. We dropped in around 6:45pm and waited for 30 minutes for a table. 

We tried the polipo (grilled octopus), the rigatoni al pomodoro and bucatini al ragu. 

The octopus was a good serving and grilled nicely. I enjoyed the chimichurri and piquillo puree but the tapenade was a bit strong for me - personal preference though. 

The rigatoni was well done and the tomato sauce had the perfect sweet and tart balance. I did not enjoy the bucatani very much as I felt it lacked meat and sauce and I did not taste the saffron in the saffron cream. 

We ended with the panna cotta and forewarning it is not a smooth panna cotta, but a grittier one so it was an interesting texture. It was enjoyable to end the meal with this. The house red wine is also good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, daily specials and delicious food, well priced. I highly recommend the Risotto Nervosa that features a braised beef rib- delicious! They don't take reservations so be sure to factor in some wait time for dinner service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is average at best. We ordered the pizza and it was small and overpriced! I would rather have a takeout pizza! There wasn't much gourmet about the food. The service was okay. The prices were too high for the portions provided. The patio is nice but it can get noisy if there is a lot of traffic. I liked the pizza at Corks above the Longo's grocery store! It was much better and the service was actually much better too!"}
{"text":"Went to Nervosa for a friend's birthday dinner. Party of 10. 

Positive(s):
Bello luogo, strong cocktails, and a delicious tiramisu. The insalate are also pretty great- try the Pollo e Formaggio insalata (Chicken & Cheese salad).

Sadly, these are this restaurant's only strong suits as far as I'm concerned.

Negative(s):
-Seating-wise, we were placed in the middle of the main floor dining room with waiters rushing past us. Very uncomfortable chairs also made for an awkward dining experience. This place does not accommodate large parties well.
-Forget coat check... so much for the Yorkville treatment.
-As they took our orders they asked several times if we wanted to order the fish because only two or three orders were left. One of my friends figured out that the fish is Friday's special, and as we were there on a Saturday, they were essentially trying to get rid of day old bread. I'll pass, thank you very much.
-While we waited for our main dishes, we were served limp nearly-stale bread. 
-Some of us ordered the Sabato (Saturday) pizza special, others went for pasta, no one was impressed.The pizzas were really dry and tasteless (pass the table salt). The pastas were just as bland and lifeless. 
-They didn't offer us any fresh black pepper or extra cheese. Come to think of it, the waiters barely checked in on us. If they had, they would have noticed the half eaten dishes and the long faces. 
-There were no kid friendly entrees, which is fine, but they pleasantly agreed to accommodate us by making a simple spaghetti bolognese for our little one. Great... except the improvised spaghetti was inedible... frozen meatballs and canned tomato sauce for $20... poor kid went home hungry and her mom with a doggie bag not fit for, you guessed it, a dog.
-Lastly, we got the bill which we couldn't make any sense out of, because dishes were renamed and some amounts were inaccurate. While the total did not reflect what we'd consumed, we couldn't be bothered to argue. Some times there is just no saving grace. Terribile! 

IN SUMMARY: Overpriced simplistic dishes; Underwhelming quality; Inattentive staff; Unmemorable and Unpleasant experience.  Flat ambiance. Note to self: Be wary of restaurants that churn out dispassionate daily 'specials'.

IN SHORT: Sad. Never again. Thank goodness for great company but glad it wasn't my birthday venue."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for a nice meal.
My family is a big fan of their wines, specially the ones from the house.

Pizza is really good.
In my opinion, they could do better in the variety of pasta, since it's a Trattoria.
The Risotto Nervosa is delicious. As well as the Funghi Linguine.

I like the ambiance but it's always full - they have little space so it feels a little tight when you're sitting.
The upstairs patio is lovely."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade pasta a pizzas. Beautiful rustic decor. Good service. Great experience."}
{"text":"Monday night and there was a lineup. Bitter cold out, no bar to wait at, and packed into the vestibule. Next time, if there were to be a next time, I'd be making reservations

Absolutely packed, which is never my favorite. I was there for good food and to catch up with a friend. The ambience was so loud that it was very difficult to talk (a situation only exasperated by a loud mouthed New Yorker, Deeply vested in proving to the woman he was at the table with, what a douche bag he could be).

The food arrived very quickly. The risotto was good, but lacked that creamy consistency that the best have. Spaghetti and meatballs was OK, the spaghetti a little overdone for my partners liking.

All in all not a pleasant experience tonight."}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent little gem in Yorkville. Had the sangria, kale salad with chicken and spilt a pizza with my colleague.
All were excellent. Service was swift and friendly. Loved that they were all wearing jeans and sneakers. Very Italiano :):)"}
{"text":"A great restaurant in Yorkville. The food is great. It is very tight and has limited space, but the patio upstairs has a great ambiance and view. The patio also provides a better dining experience especially during the spring/summer. The service was fine, their were various different servers. It is all a matter of personal preference when it comes to servers, I prefer moderate talking/asking questions from servers and they did exactly that (e.g. asked how the food was two-four times).

My favourites: Fettucine Alla Bolognese, Pollo e Formaggio (Salad), Prosciutto e Rucola (Pizza)."}
{"text":"Went back here after remembering really enjoying it a few years ago. The staff was aloof and they didn't communicate to each other when we requested drinks, resulting in us not having any. (The drinks were overpriced, anyway, so it was probably for the best.)

The food came very quickly, so that was good. And one of the two dishes we had -- a pasta -- was very good, indeed. The pizza, though, was uninspiring.

It was also very loud, and a little cramped.

Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazingly Italian. Food quality and atmosphere is very good. Service is excellent and the waitress Federica is very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"i was very disappointed by the service here today. It wasn't that busy as it was a Sunday, so I don't really know what's going on. We had to wait a good 10 minutes to be seated (it was awkward standing in the doorway for so long) and then another 10 to get our order out. Maybe they were under-staffed, I don't know.

The food here is spectacular, though, and that's where Trattoria Nervosa is saved. We had the Pizza Classica (like a normal Margherita, but with mushrooms and spicy Italian salami) and the Mozzarella and tomato salad (don't remember what it's called, but it's fantastic). 

Both of the dishes were really yummy, and I would definitely say they are worth the wait!

The bread that we were served was m'eh, but the EVOO and Vinegar makes up for that, I suppose.

The overall feel of the place all depends on where you end up sitting. The downstairs dining area is pretty crowded. All of the tables are very close together, and it makes dining conversation pretty awkward when the table next to you can see what brand of makeup you have on.

The upstairs dining room (reserved for dinner I think) is very cozy and spacious. While downstairs looks very rustic, upstairs is fine dining-y.

In my opinion, the terrace is where it's at, but good luck getting a seat there! ;)"}
{"text":"Slow service, hostess at the door was a lost cause, food was overpriced garbage, the manager was a cocky douche bag; overall a lousy experience. I hope the owners pick up their game. 

I would rather pay more and go to one of the neighboring restaurants."}
{"text":"Really pleasant & efficient staff. Table for 2, no reservation, no problem. We were seated upstairs where we enjoyed a delightful dinner of Polpo (octopus), pumpkin ravioli and Branzino. Complimentary bread and lots of wine choices available by the glass. A perfect impromptu walk-in dinner."}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian food. But must say too bad don't take reservations. The pastas are fantastic as well as the pizza and cheese platters. A must if in yorkville and looking for homemade Italian style food.  Might have to wait for a table if busy. But worth it."}
{"text":"It's my favourite restaurant in Yorkville. 

From the salad's to the oven baked pizza's all the food is amazing. 

The service is just as good too!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends at Trattoria Nervosa yesterday...here are my thoughts:

Ambiance: This restaurant is super busy and super noisy. We scored a nice table upstairs on the outdoor patio so it was a bit quieter. But still, expect to be hoarse at the end of your meal.

Service: Food is VERY SLOW. This wouldn't have been such a problem if we hadn't been melting in the heat.

Food: Average at best.
-- Sea Bream special was very salty (and I'm usually attached at the hit to the salt shaker). It was also small portion-wise. The addition of a vegetable would have helped the salt-factor and my hunger.
-- Chicken was laughably tiny as well. My husband at this dish in 2 bites and then devoured the bread basket because he was still starving.
-- Margherita pizza went over well with my 11-year-old.
-- Friends had the kale salad with salmon added, a caesar salad, and some kind of risotto. They seemed to have enjoyed their food.

Overall: This restaurant can get away with it's exorbitant prices due to it's location...since I can have better food at Chipotle, at 1/4 of the cost, there seems to be no reason to return to Trattoria Nervosa."}
{"text":"We came here for a sit down lunch on a Monday afternoon, was surprised to see how busy it was for a week day. We ordered sangrias both red and white. We would recommend the white instead of the red. Very refreshing. We had beef carpaccio that was delicious. You must order the mushroom pasta it was amazing. We also ordered a pizza which was tasty. My only complaint is that when the food was served it wasn't very hot."}
{"text":"Trattoria Nervosa is located in the heart of Yorkville and serves delicious Italian food. I've been to their sister restaurant, Gusto 101, plenty of times but only recently tried Nervosa for the first time. Both Nervosa and Gusto have almost identical menus but there are some differences (in terms of food and in price). Due to the location and probably the customers the Yorkville area attracts, the food is slightly more expensive at Nervosa (even when comparing the same dish that is found at both Nervosa and Gusto). Nonetheless, great Italian food in the city.

My boyfriend and I arrived at Trattoria Nervosa on a Saturday night at around 6:30pm. We expected there to be a line and probably waited about 15 minutes before we got a table. Once seated we were given water and given ample time to decide what we wanted to eat. My boyfriend selected an Italian beer while I opted for a pinot grigio. To start we ordered a tagliere misto (cured meat board) to share. It came with a selection of 4 cured meats, pickled vegetables, crostini, and mustard. Great sharing board to share, very light and refreshing. For the mains we both ordered the infamous mafalde ai funghi. Can never get sick of this pasta dish. I don't even enjoy eating mushrooms but I'll eat this pasta any day. We both didn't get dessert as we wanted to eat elsewhere afterwards. 

Overall, great friendly service, amazing food (as always), and comforting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Location: Yorkville Avenue, Toronto
Items Ordered: Pitcher of Red Sangria ($43) + Tagliere Misto ($17.99 for one)

I've been here numerous times simply for their signature sangria. They have this summer drink recipe just right. I've brought dates, friends, bosses, ex-employees, just about anyone that needs a good glass of vino here.
 
It's the cutest, two tiered, narrow, yellow house on the Yorkville strip, surprisingly without that pretentious feel. Café Nervosa has the perfect outdoor patio for people watching, which is a part time hobby of mine however, my favourite spot is the upper floor patio that is half covered and half open; the best of both worlds.
 
This last particular time I was there, my former boss and I ordered a plate of the Tagliere Misto, a selection of artisan cheeses and Italian cured meats. As garnishes the plate came with a fresh fruit preserve, tapenade, bread and nuts. It tasted as good as it looked and was a excellent accessory to our pitcher. 

I have nothing bad to say about this place. Great service as well. 
I have yet to have a proper meal here so stay tuned..."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio and atmosphere,service was ok nothing great, food was nothing special, lack of seasoning and something i could do at home anytime, this place is over rated just because its situated in yorkville, in my opinion there is better places out there."}
{"text":"went to dinner here a few weeks ago; the food was pretty good and decently priced. i had the risotto nervosa - the braised short rib was amazing.

pretty good atmosphere for dates but can get packed on the weekends. would recommend making a reso."}
{"text":"Busy at lunch with all sorts but not for me

Seating outside, inside and up stairs. 
Service was very fast. It we did order salad and pasta. Most of the incidence are already ready already.  

Too much balsamic in the pollo fungilli. The chicken absorbed the vinegar turning it black and loosing all chicken flavor. As too did the mushroom. It was one, big, balsamic mess.

With all the choices, I'll move on thank you."}
{"text":"I thought it was fitting to have dinner here before heading to the Beyonce & JayZ concert as they really put this place on the map after lunching here last summer.

The restaurant is split in 3 levels - an outside patio that on the ground level, the main floor dining area and the top floor dining area. I would have loved to dine on the ground floor patio however it was quite windy out so we just decided to go for the main floor.

Upon entering a waiter greeted us and offered us a cozy table in the corner next to floor to ceiling windows that open up. It was nice to be a level up and gaze down at the happenings on Yorkville. 

For drinks we decide to go with two glasses of nice rich Pinot Grigio

For appetizers we decide to share two items

Polpette con Provolone Affumicato - beef, veal and pork meatballs braised in tomato sauce & smoked provolone 
The meatballs themselves are nothing spectacular however I loved the addition of the melted smoked provolone draped over top. It really elevated the dish from being boring old meatballs and added a nice smokey flavour.

Insalata di Cavolo Nero - lacinate kale, zante currants, toasted pine nuts, shaved pecorino parmigiano, lemon vinaigrette
I loveddd this salad! It had all the elements bitter kale, sweet currants, salty parmigiano, and crunchy pinenuts all evenly coated in a mild tangy vinaigrette

For Main we of course had to try out the pizza

Margherita - tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil
Nice thin crispy crust, fresh gooey mozzarella, ample sauce, and crispy basil. Just the way I like my pizza! 

Finally for dessert I couldn't resist but order the Tiramisu. It did not disappoint, in fact I'd say it's one of the best in the city! Two layers high with a thick layer of sweet and tangy mascarpone and those espresso drenched lady fingers it was sinfully delicious!

Overall I have to say it's definitely worth checking out. Tasty food, friendly service, and in the heart of Yorkville, if J&B like it why not give it a try?"}
