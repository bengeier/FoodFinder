{"text":"Good, fast, simple Chinese food. Nothing fancy but really good for what it was. Service was quick and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience here. The prices are cheap. We are vegetarian and sometime we find it hard to find good food. Chinese is always nice because we order the vegetables with brown sauce and just pour it over the rice.  The staff is really friendly and seem to appreciate the business"}
{"text":"Awesome fried rice. As soon as I called and I out my order they said 10 minutes. That sounded unreasonable until I picked up the food. And to my surprise it was well and super warm. I will certainly keep eating at this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with family and friends but finally got to writing a review. Lunch specials are great, large portions of food. Defiantly two servings!! Staff is very attention, has a family owned feel to it. I've had shrimp with lobster sauce, huge portions. Other great dishes are the Kung pao shrimp, sweet and sour chicken and hot garlic chicken. Plan on coming again!"}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly and polite staff and service is always with a smile.  I love this place."}
{"text":"As much as I hate trying new chinese food places, I gave this one a shot. I'm glad I did. The food is very good, hot and prepared quickly. It's convenient to me and it's definitely worth the try. Food portions are large and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Bei Jing for lunch today for the first time. I ordered the General Tso's lunch combo and also fried wontons. The fried wontons tasted like every other friend wonton out there. The General Tso's was pretty good considering I like my chicken to be slightly breaded but friend enough to have a little harder of an outside. It wasn't rubbery like a lot of places make it. The fried rice was really soft and fluffy like it was uncle bens that was cooked for slightly too long."}
{"text":"1 star because I have to have a star to write a review. The food is bland and possibly overlooked. I didn't enjoy my experience at all; the cashier/order taker didn't specialize in customer service at the least and to top it all off they have a 92 sanitation score.  Will not be visiting again AND suggest that you take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm writing solely about the customer service.  I called in a pick up order and they said you can come pick up in twenty minutes.  So I did come in after 20 minutes and when I entered the restaurant there were already 8 people waiting for their pickup order and I guess they still haven't picked up their order yet.  So it's been 35 minutes and I still haven't pick up my order yet and the others haven't either.  This is pretty bad - the waitress is useless too. I'm hoping the food is good.  I'm waiting 5 more minutes"}
{"text":"Beijing is by far our favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. We'd tried several others in our search for quick takeout Chinese food restaurant and once we found Beijing, we stopped looking. I love that they have dinner specials that include an eggroll, soup and fried rice, most places only offer those during lunch.   So far everything we've ordered has been great - wonton soup, pork with garlic sauce, lo mein, sesame chicken, chicken with vegetables, shrimp with garlic sauce (HUGE shrimp - not the tiny little shrimp you get at some other places), beef with broccoli - to name a few. This may seem really trivial, but we love their eggrolls. We moved to Houston for 4 years and couldn't find decent eggrolls anywhere (we like the softer skinned, \"bumpy\" ones vs. the hard, thin-skinned, overfried small eggrolls.) I will say their wonton soup broth is extremely brown, which was off-putting the first time, but it's delicious.  I also like that they have a website, I always find myself losing paper menus so it's convenient to be able to look it up on my phone and call in a to-go order."}
{"text":"This is truly a gem!! The food is wonderfull. Its a little hidden place and its not flashy in any way,but the food is great!! Everything was well prepared and seasoned. Our waitress was very friendly and the service was fast!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and service is attentive. Great value and highly recommended. Lunch special at 5.95 including soup and egg rolls is great value. Mongolian beef is very tasty so is orange chicken. This is truly a great mom-pop joint which is very authentic. If you are seafood lover, you should try seafood noodle soup, Kung pao shrimp, salt pepper shrimp and Walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"I just had an amazing laugh with my wife reading the reviews on one of our favorite people and restaurant.  We have been coming to the restaurant ever since it opened, and all I can say is every bit of it is true.  If your kids are messy she will discipline them or you.  If you sit somewhere or grab an extra napkin she will move you or take it away from you.  Our family doesn't call her the grumpy waitress.  We call her the owner, who drives the nice mercedes outside, so Scoreboard!!!  As for the food it is the awesome neighborhood chinese that every town needs, and will always meet expectations.  The owners attitude?  Hilarious.  How many of us saw the Seinfeld Soup Nazi episode and said to ourselves, \"I wish I had a restaurant like that in my neighborhood, where if you don't behave right... No Chinese for YOU!!!\"  Keep the reviews rolling in, and stop taking yourselves so seriously; at Beijing Chinese, you get Dinner and a Show, no extra charge."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful when taking a job a couple of years ago and also living very close to this place and have visited this restaurant about 8 times in the 2 years. Disappointed each and every time. I love egg fu young and the first time I got it was decent for a fast food style chinese restaurant. The next 2 times was terrible. Burned on the outside, dry on the inside and the gravy had the consistency of peanut butter. Sweet and sour pork is just ok, more breading than pork, sesame chicken was bland and overcooked.   My last visit on 1/28 was perhaps the most disappointing of all. I walked in to order take out. I ordered sweet and sour pork and vegetable lomein. Got my order and got home to find vegetable fried rice instead. First let me say they do not seem to use regular rice, it's more like instant rice in all their dishes. I have never gotten anything with actual fresh vegetables, the have to be either frozen out of a bag or come from a can. The only difference in the vegetable fried rice is they add some soggy broccoli and and those little corn cobs out of a can. Otherwise it was simply a big pile of fried rice.   The only thing consistent about this place is that the portions are large and it's cheap if that's your thing. To me cheap and quantity is still a waste of money if it is not good. I will not go back and it's a shame because it is convenient to me. Instead I'll pay a little more and get fresh Chinese/Asian food from one of the Asian fusion places in Uptown."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a million times and would have ventured nearly as many guesses that I would never eat at a place called Bei Jing.  First, I don't really like to eat MSG-ridden Chinese food.  Electric red sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken have never interested me.  Second, the look of the place kinda freaked me out.  But when the lady wants hot and sour soup and the fridge is lacking hot and sour soup, I can and will become interested in Bei Jing.    Hot and spicy soup.  Delicious.  Wonton (I nearly typed wanton, which is something altogether different) soup.  Delicious.  Pork dumplings.  Pretty delicious.  Chicken fried rice.  Simple and pretty delicious.  Unlike most other fried rice, there was not a bag of frozen peas and carrots thrown in this rice.  And it was all quite cheap.    Will I eat here again?  Yes.  Will it be soon?  No.  Will I ever eat General Tso's chicken or chicken that looks like it has been dipped in cherry compote?  No.  Is Beijing one word or two?  It all depends on whose awning you're reading."}
{"text":"I ordered a take out - Orange Chicken and it was pathetic. Had to trash it as it was anything but edible"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review for this place because the recent bad reviews had me second guessing myself for placing a 1st time order of $100 worth of food.  However, as it turned out, the food was terrific and the person who took and delivered my order (Alex) was so nice.  It's also worth mentioning that their order to delivery time was good.    We had an impromptu gathering at a friend's house yesterday.  I was looking for restaurants that delivered in the area and decided on this place.  We ordered a variety of items including appetizers, soup, entrees, fried rice and lo mein.  Everything was exceptionally tasty.  The food was well prepared and not greasy; which certainly exceeded my expectations for a low to moderately priced Chinese restaurant.  I will definitely order from Beijing Chinese Cuisine again!"}
{"text":"I had the Creaky Chicken for lunch and was very happy with it. It is a simple dish like orange chicken, but was done well. They were quick to refill my ice tea and I did not wait long at all to get my bill once I was done. I will definitely be back.  The inside is nice as well. There is quite a bit of artwork, good quality furniture, and some unique hanging lantern (not sure how else to describe them) lighting fixtures."}
{"text":"The most disappointing Chinese take-out I've had in a while. The spare ribs were fatty, the mu shu had a too-strong flavor of star anise, the eggplant was very oily and not very spicy and the noodles were bland and had fatty pork. I really can't figure out why this place has a 4 star average? I'd rather eat at just about any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Driven by here a million times and had no desire to stop in. A friend told me they went here and loved it, so I gave it a try. I get grossed out easily if places are dirty. However, you walk in here and it is so impeccably clean. It seems to be a nice family owned business. The service is fantastic. The hot tea is freshly made with herbs and steeped...Delicious. Only $1.75 and they bring a nice little pot enough to share. The prices are incredible. $8.95 got me a Sa Cha Chicken with fried rice, soup, and egg roll. This is \"old school\" nothing fancy. No fancy pricing! They even have coupons out! My new favorite place. Also, a perk I enjoy....On these freezing cold nights you can easily park right at the door!!!! Looks like they do a lot of take out."}
{"text":"When it comes to your favorite food you are always critical on how it taste, smells and looks. Well at least I am. When you first walk into to Beijing Chinese Cuisine you first notice the smell of great food, you are second greeted by a friendly staff and then you see your food. Wow, this place has large portions great prices that worth every penny.   The best thing to have when your sick is no longer chicken noodle soup. Trust me go into this place and order there hot and sour soup, not only is it the best hot sour soup in Vegas but it really makes you feel like you cured your cold with the lightly spicy and warm full filling soup.   That dish is not even there best. They have so many to choose from its hard to pick from there full menu of pork, chicken and beef plates, noodles and rice plates, exocit plates, and appetizers. They are all great.  Most of there dishes come with a free side of white rice which just puts this place above the rest. Service is awesome for a Chinese Food restaurant, if you eat there or take out. This place gets 5 stars every time I go. They have not and do not change there quality in service, price, and taste!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Here for lunch. Hubby had tofu and I had vegetable chicken. Both were delicious. The place is VERY clean and the staff (owners?) was very friendly. We'll try it for dinner sometime. The lunch specials are $5.95 and come with soup, egg roll, and rice. Good price and good food. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Worst service I've ever had- waitress was rude and argued with me when she messed up our order. Soft drinks tasted bad and food was mediocre at best. Definitely will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef here. Their Won Ton Soup is my favorite as well. Great for cold weather~"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, the food is wonderful and reasonably priced. The tables and decor are very nice and the restaurant is well kept. Staff was happy to serve and we're always in and out! Can't wait to go back. The Kung Pao Shrimp is awesome! Lunch special is a great deal also."}
{"text":"Great staff.. Very Attentive..  I had the Jajangmyun. It tasted OK, a bit bland. It had tons of onions and I think it had a bit of meat but didn't see it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here about 5 times now, and we've had different dishes every time. The portions are plentiful, and we have yet to try something we did not like. The atmosphere is great, the staff is very friendly, and their dessert included with every meal is mouth watering! I could just take home a package of them, whatever they are (some kind of hard caramel and a banana, very hard to describe). It took almost 2 years after moving here to find a good chinese restaurant. If you're still looking, please give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Their speciality is serving cold and stalled food. Worst part is they take 1 hour to get that cold food. The waitress didn't even felt that she took so long. The quality is poor and food is semi cooked. I wish to give negative stars but unfortunately there isn't.   Stay away from this place. There are better places  to eat."}
{"text":"I really hate the fact that I have to give this place only 3 stars. It's getting 3 stars because the guy that helped us was really nice and the food was really fast (take out). With that being said, our food was a big disappointment. The only entree that was a little decent was the orange chicken, but even Panda Express could have done better. Our egg foo young patties were burnt so they were bitter and had a funny metallic taste to it, vegetable lo mien, no flavor at all, bland, pork fried rice, also bland. I don't know how all of their food can be bland, it was like they were watching their sodium intake there. Really sad and disappointed because we were hoping to find a decent Chinese food place."}
{"text":"We had orange chicken and a vegetable dish.  Both were very good.  Atmosphere is classic Chinese - very nice. Great service. Nice portions. Our first visit - and we will return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always fast and delicious! I always get the House Special Beef or Chicken and it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Good crab Rangoon. Decent prices and the place looked really clean. The customers in there already looked pretty pleased with service. Only complaint is that there is no delivery or late night pick up."}
{"text":"First time trying this place.  Had great yelp reviews.   So i gave it a try.   Delivery was very fast.  But the food was so bland.  Fried rice tasted like white rice.  The beef and mushrooms were flavorless.  Sesame chicken was average.  Smallest egg roll I've ever seen.  Very small portions for what you pay.  I've had better food at panda express sadly to say.  Yelp failed me on this one.  Lots of other chinese spots to try before Id ever go back here."}
{"text":"The salt and pepper shrimp is outstanding, the flavor is like nothing I've had before.  Highly recommend that dish.  The orange chicken is also very good, if you like spicy chicken get the spicy fried chicken!  It's crispy yet chewy, great texture.  The fried cheese wontons and the dumplings are classic, you can't go wrong with this place.  They deliver as well!  Be sure to ask for the free soda is you order delivery!"}
{"text":"Finally a good sit-down Asian restaurant that does takeout too. Their kung pao chicken is excellent - better than any I've had in the valley over the past 10+ years. The appetizers are great; really everything I've tasted has been great. Friendly staff will go out of their way to provide a pleasant experience.   They were just recognized as one of the top 100 Asian restaurants in the U.S. Definitely check this one out!"}
{"text":"I rated Beijing two stars because the food was well prepared.  I tried the Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup.  The seafood: shrimp, squid, 1 mussel, as well as the vegetables and noodles were all properly cooked; that is not overcooked to the point of being unchewable or boiled into a mushy pablum.  The problem was that the soup tasted like colored water.  I doused the bowl with additional chile sauce, with more and more salt, with white pepper, and still the broth swirled in the bowl like insipid, unsteeped tea.  I also sampled the Cashew Chicken.  The dish boasted the same attributes, but suffered from the same irremedial flaw: lack of flavor.  Oh, the portion was huge, piled with cashews, but in spite of the colorful vegetables, the thin darkly colored sauce tasted very much like the soup broth.  This is a family restaurant, everyone but the dishwasher seems related.  We were seated promptly, of course, only one other person, aside from the entire restaurant staff sat in the restaurant.  Our table lacked forks or napkins, which the server did not bring, when she served the appetizer.  I finally had to rob the set-ups from another table.  I did this as the seated hostess watched with obvious ennui.  I wouldn't go back, especially since Pin Kaow, a superb Thai restaurant, sits right up the street."}
{"text":"This place has the freshest and best Chinese food in the west valley!!! My husband and I can both eat one portion because they are so generous! We usually order two entrees just to have leftovers"}
{"text":"Although I've never dined in, I've gotten take out 3 times. The food is very good and the service is fast. My 3 year old who isn't too intersted in food, LOVES the Hunan Beef. She keeps asking for more. The Mango chicken is also delicious and the Wonton soup we had was excellent!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. Totally disgusting. First off they don't serve \"dinners\" everything is separate, and the woman working there is the rudest Chinese lady ever. The won ton soup had the WORST FISHY after taste. My husband and I walked out after taking a sip of the soup and they charged us $10!!! For ONE SODA (I didn't even have a drink) and a bowl of soup. I'm still burping up fishy smells. My advice. Go anywhere else. Worst language barrier while ordering as well, please do yourself a favor and eat out of a garbage can behind McDonald's before you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"Service is bad. The old lady and 2 waiter have no smiles. Standing at the door for 5 minutes, no one come up say anything. The old lady asked me to wait by the door, then they let other people to seat first. When I let them know, one one even say sorry."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Came today 3-4-2017 and it's closed for business at this location.  Too bad our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Now need to find another one."}
{"text":"It's pretty difficult to find good Korean style Chinese food in Vegas.  This is only one of two places that in my opinion are any good.  Growing up, there were plenty of places in LA's Koreatown and the valley to get my fix so I'm happy to have a couple here in Vegas.  Anyways, we ended up ordering the spicy seafood noodle soup, black bean noodles, fried chicken in hot garlic sauce and sweet and sour beef.  The black bean noodles were average but the spicy noodle soup was pretty good.  It had good spice, seafood flavor and a decent amount of seafood.  The beef was spot on and chicken was great as well( the sauce was thinner and a little different than I was used to, but still tasty).  Prices were decent($50 after tax) and the servings were massive, especially the beef and chicken. I haven't had the regular Chinese menu yet but I'll probably stick to the Korean style."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food; Fresh and tasty.  I had the Mongolian Beef.  Nice decor. Clean.  Great customer service. The only negative note I'd leave is that they charge a $2 fee if you'd like a refill of your drink \"to go.\"...although refills while you're there are complimentary."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese restaurant. It is nothing fancy, just tasty, cheap, quick Chinese food. Family owned, the owners are super friendly! If you are in the area and in the mood for Chinese food, I would definitely recommend this place. Way better than the competition!"}
{"text":"Very good, Lunch special 7 Days a week. Decent amount of food for decent price."}
{"text":"First time here. Couldn't believe how much food you get when you order one of the dinner for 2 combos. Will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"On 8-23-10 11:30 a.m. my wife and I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special. The Diet Cokes were flat and tasted old. The spicy soup tasted like tomato sauce and the beef tasted rotten. We did not drink the Coke or eat the soup. We did not take a second bite of the beef and we didn't even try the rice. They didn't care that we didn't like the food and charged us for both meals. Finally, after asking if they were gonna charge me for food and drinks that didn't taste right, they still charged us for  one meal and the Cokes at $12.43.  One star cause the place looked nice. We then went to Chop Chop for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got any good reviews. Just left there fifteen dollars less and still hungry. Ordered the sesame chicken and kung pao tofu. The chicken was the worst grade chicken I ever tasted fatty and had an off taste. Just your general cheap as you can get chicken. As for the kung pao tofu, zero vegetables just soggy tofu and peanuts. Seriously both were awful! I have no idea how this place stays open. As for the server. I could not understand one word she was saying. Very poor english. Sorry bejing don't put someone on the floor who can't communicate with your customers. Once again left hungry and annoyed at the poor service and the food they think is acceptable to serve. Never again!"}
{"text":"The lady was so nice! The food is a bit Americanized but still very delicious. The spicy noodle on Korean menu was especially good."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place....don't trust reviews...This place doesn't deserve even a single star. They made us wait for 30 mins and got us the cold stale food. When we asked the lady said its made fresh , in which world freshly made food is cold (which is supposed to be hot) and she didn't get total order......horrible part was she didn't realize the mistake and told us we didn't cook food so we can't say it's not cold....."}
{"text":"WE GOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR HAVING KIDS!!!!  DONT GO HERE!  I have never experienced anything like this in my 30 years of living!  The owner is EXTREMELY RUDE.  We walked in with our 3 children and the lady told us that its carryout only!  She didnt smile and say sorry she just rushed us out the door.  I called 5 mins after we left to make a reservation to dine in and she said \"ok see you in 15 mins.\"  So I walked back in telling her im here for the reservation (while recording her from my phone) and she said carryout only.  She told me I can dine in if I had 4 adults but no kids.  She continued to tell me that she remembers me from before and my kids made a mess.  I'm from MICHIGAN and ive NEVER been there before!!!!  This lady is horrible and I have no idea how this place is still in business.  DONT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, excellent food, amazing service. Eat here a couple times a month.  Fast delivery and fresh food, I could not recommend it more."}
{"text":"After reading reviews my hubby and I still decided to give them a try. I am so glad we did!!! I had the egg drop soup and it was amazing and my husband got an egg roll....amazing!! We will be back and recommend this place to everyone.   We had a great experience with the service here as well. They were very attentive and kind."}
{"text":"Very good food, clean place, good service. Great for take out.  It is somewhat overpriced, but you will not find many options in this area"}
{"text":"First time eating here, and I am torn. The food was ready for pick up in about 5 minutes. I like that lunch specials come with the rice and all in the same container. Beef w/ broccoli was just OK... Could have used more sauce. Will definitely go back though, lots of potential here!"}
{"text":"Food is generally good.  Service is average.  The older lady that waits tables/works there is often in a bad mood and not pleasant to have her wait on you when she is!"}
{"text":"Location and decor is great, food is good, but service is horrible! There was nobody but us and another family in the restaurant and the waitress walked around banging the plates super loud on the rest of the tables - extremely rude- and when she asked us our order she was yelling at us. When she came around with the water and our entrees she smacked it on the table and walked away. Food and portions of the entrees are good, but the rice portion was extremely small. I will never sit and eat here, perhaps will take it to go."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service. We waited 20 minutes at the table and they never took our order or even gave us water. The food isn't bad, but the service is terrible. Don't expect any refills or any ounce of decent service."}
{"text":"On the one hand, the service is always friendly and helpful, and the portions are generous. On the other hand... well, the food is a mixed bag. Vegetables are usually crisp and flavorful, but the preparation of the meat and seafood leaves a good deal to be desired. Their salt-and-pepper shrimp is far greasier than it should be. Their chicken, too, suffers. Every time I go it's a little too overcooked and bland.  So if you go, I would recommend sticking with vegetarian fare. They do a decent job with that."}
{"text":"I ordered some food to go a couple of days ago, and found that one of the fortune cookies was half eaten by something that ate through the wrapper, and the second cookie was completely gone. I did not see this until the next day after I ate the food. It obviously had been gnawed by a rodent. I thought I would let the restaurant know about my discovery, so I went over there to show them. The man was so rude, and kept shouting \"no mice!, no mice!\" He then tried to say that the cookies come \"out of box!\" I tried to tell him I am sure he does not make the cookies there, but that he put the cookie and wrapper in with my food, and that's disgusting. I had no intention of asking for my money back until he started shouting at me. Of course, he would not give me a refund. So, I ended up calling the bank and charging it back.  I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very cheap and very delicious.  For just $6.95 you can get just about any kind of classic Chinese entree imaginable with an egg roll and rice.  For that price, I wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasently surprised and have ventured back several times since my first time there.  Everyone remembers their first time.  Great spot for a quick, cheap and tasy lunch for all you peeps in the South End and Downtown.  I recommend General Tso's Chicken... I know, I know.... BORING.  But it is absolutley delictable here."}
{"text":"Just a small little restaurant in the neighborhood and the food is outstanding.  I enjoy eating the Walnut Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork, Mango Chicken, Crab Ragoons.  The staff is fair.  Our waiter has always been super nice."}
{"text":"OMG !!! the food was awfully weird.. It's not a traditional chinese but also not american chinese. Oily, salty and a lot of MSG!. I felt so thirsty after I ate the food. To make it even worse, the waitress was so rude !  I saw her made a really bad comment in cantonese language because she thought the guess didn't give enough tip. My husband was the one who translate it for me since he's cantonese. So, GUYS.. if you want chinese food you better go to GREAT WALL !!! good food and more professional services"}
{"text":"If you are looking for truly authentic Chinese food, look no further.  I was visiting my boyfriend for the weekend when we stumbled upon this little hidden gem.  We decided to give it a try.  Having both spent many months in China, we love to find the truly authentic asian cuisine.  We ordered the combo for two people which included spring rolls, wontons, soup, and each got a  platter of food.  The service was very fast and they were very attentive to our table.  Our whole meal was about $24.  A great deal for the amount of food we got.  We had leftovers for a few meals after that.  The owner and her husband are such sweet people.  Make sure to check this place out.  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!!!  can't really find any places that have the Korean black bean noodles, this place is right across the street!! And they make it so delicious!!! My boy friend ordered some Chinese food that was delicious as well. The only down side is that when they deliver they don't include napkins and silver ware."}
{"text":"Not good,  you can read up their violations,   bugs on floor and I didn't feel it was clean so I checked there violations"}
{"text":"I had huge expectation after reading reviews on yelp....However, I didn't like any food that we ordered. I am Korean so I know what good Korean-Chinese food. This is not even close to good Korean-Chinese food.   Sweet and sour pork was very bitter...even sauce couldn't cover the bitterness of the pork. I think this restaurant uses old oil to fry everything. I never had any fried food this bitter.  Shrimp with Lobster sauce was super runny not much flavors."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at Beijing restaurant the folks where very nice but not knowing what to order the waitress suggested spicy fried eggplant plant with tofu and white rice. Let me just say it was delicious! As for my appetizer they consisted of 4 vegetable egg rolls which were very tasty but not homemade. The place was clean and my waitress made sure I was happy. Yes I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I come here for the lunch special somewhat often.  $5.95 from 11a-3p every day and the selection has like 20 things to choose from.  I always get the Mongolian Beef and for the price structure, it is by far the best out here in Vegas.  Good portions of beef, with a starter of choice of soup: corn or hot n sour (honestly I don't like either so I pass) and choice of spring roll or salad (both are good). I always add the cheese wontons (6 for $4.95).  Unfortunately/fortunately, however you want to look at it, this is an \"authentic\" employer...so I wouldn't recommend asking for things off the menu.  I asked for crab rangoons and was starred at with a blank look...repeated several times, then when I thought about it a little more and asked for cheese wontons I was met with \"ok cheese wonton\".  it's not on the menu I just always enjoy these.  no added frills to them though from here, just cream cheese in the wonton.   Anywhoo, good place for a good cheap lunch that you will walk out of with a full belly."}
{"text":"Move over Panda Express-I've finally found my go to place for Chinese carry out! After many failed attempts with Chinese take our in Charlotte, I visited Bei Jing for take out and will be paying them more visits in the future.   Not only do they have a huge menu with standard items plus some I've never heard of but they also offer lunch specials every day (dine in or to go). Another thing I like is they offer dinner specials that won't clear out your wallet and with that you get the entree, fried rice, eggroll AND your choice of soup. And the entree comes in a snazzy, durable container that will bring me more use in the future. I got the sesame chicken dinner and loved that it came with fresh veggies (I am using the plural loosely as it was only two pieces of broccoli but don't mind because it was so green and fresh and not drowning in sauce). The egg roll was a mini eggroll but really, after all that food, I don't need an eggroll on steroids. The hot and sour soup was standard but it seemed spicier than other places and left my nostrils clear and pleased. The dinner portion was huge which left half for me to enjoy later. The cherry on the sundae was my fortune, I usually get a crappy, transparent fortune and for once, got something that actually made a little sense.  An array of menu items+ generous portions +tasty food+ quick service = a happy, full me."}
{"text":"The noodles before the meal was good. Ordered from the Korean section, got a bowl of noodles floating in fishy, soupy cornstarch, no taste, but smelled fishy. BBQ ribs were soft, but seemed like bottled sauce was poured over the top right before serving. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"It had been years since I visited this place but I used to really like it, so I decided to stop in for lunch.   They have a lunch special for $5.99 that includes an entree, soup, egg roll, and steamed rice. It's 11am-3pm daily, which I like that it's not just during the week. I asked the waitress if I could have fried rice instead of white, she said no but brought it to me anyway. :) It was a nice surprise!   You get a lot of food for the money and it's good. I would suggest sharing with someone else if you can because I noticed after eating so much chicken, it kind of had an after taste. I wonder if eating a little bit of two different entrees would be better! I remembered why I haven't visited this restaurant in a while...I get a very full, heavy feeling afterwards. Chinese restaurants that are part of a chain don't give me that same feeling. That's why I like the lunch special so there is less food and no leftovers. (If that makes sense!)"}
{"text":"Oh my word, this place is so bad. Look, they have this really cheap lunch special, which is their only draw for some locals I guess. The place is dirty, the service is horrible and awkward, unless you start barking instructions which I hate to do, can I have some chopsticks, napkins, water, soy sauce and please don't throw it at me and look at me like I just murdered someone. I ordered steamed dumpling, which came out grey and raw. I told them to just fry it up, it still came out horrible and grey-orange. I had their spicy seafood soup...don't order the Korean-Chinese dishes, they are just horrendous and an abomination. Their sauces were old and dirty. We paid, didn't eat, and walked over to Baja Fresh next door for some fish tacos. This place wouldn't survive in LA or SF and it shouldn't in Henderson either."}
{"text":"Always good, every time!  The staff is always very friendly, food is prepared quickly and is excellent!  Highly recommended.  It's now called Beijing though, looks like same ownership just different name."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 2nd time last night and enjoyed it as much as the first. Both times I ordered take out. The place never looks busy (people sitting there eating), but the amount of people standing around waiting for take out is amusing. People are wearing suits or gym clothes...no matter...people just flock for good Chinese. Nothing over the top, but it's an extensive menu and I've never gotten sick here, which puts it at 4 stars in my book...ha! Menu is online too, so no worries if you don't have a menu. Easy parking for pick up too.   Recommendations for food...General Tso Chicken...order the dinner special, as it comes with soup and an egg roll too. Smaller portion, but all of the items above for $9. Sa Cha beef is good too!  Recommendations for business...offer delivery. :) (not available now)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in town. We have a friend who lives in Southend and whenever we can we try to get Chinese from here.   The restaurant is clean and smallish. But we have fit a group of 6/7 people. The staff is nice and quick to take your order. The portions are big and super tasty! I've had the sesame chicken (not too crunchy and great flavor), chicken and broccoli (chicken was cooked well but could a touch more flavor), and my fiancé always gets the scallion chicken (a tad spicy, I think, but great flavor!). The rice is great and not dry! Egg rolls are good and so is the wonton soup. The prices are extremely reasonable (under $10 for the dinner combo as of 5/4/18) for the location.   If you go in and order take out they are pretty fast. I think we waited maybe 8-10 minutes. Definitely worth the trip! Now that the light rail goes there from NoDa we definitely will make a trip just to eat there."}
{"text":"I love the decor and the food at this hidden gem on the West side.  Please be aware it us family run and the hostess is probably the wife if the cook and she can be viewed as a bit rude.  The service may not always be the best but the food will make up for it. Be adventurous and try something Bejing style."}
{"text":"Fast service... They said 30-45 min and was there in 15-20. Great price for the amount of food. Bought a main dish and fed me and another person with extra left. Definitely will be ordering again"}
{"text":"Most people know that when you're sick you should eat chicken noodle soup. However, how many of you know that Chinese restaurants make the best chicken noodle soup! I had the soup from Bei Jing last week and it was top notch.  A few days later I was feeling much better and went to Bei Jing for dinner with friends. Everything was delicious, the restaurant super clean, and the staff friendly and helpful.    I've never seen it packed in there either as I drive home from work so I hope they are doing well because we need this place in Southend. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Solid Americanized Chinese take out.  They are a little pricey but the food tastes fresh and take out orders are made fast."}
{"text":"Ugh, I should have known better. As soon as I walked in the door I was smacked in the face with the 90.5 Sanitation rating. Do you know how many infractions have to happen to get a 90.5??? A ton, that's how many. So there I was, paralyzed between my good judgment and my crippling craving for a nice beef with broccoli. So I took a gamble and tried Beijing.  The lunch price was just $7 or so which included an unimpressive spring roll that left grease on the tongue, brownish rice (I suspect it was not actually brown grain rice but soy colored rice) and a fatty beef with broccoli in a slimy thick sauce with too much thickener and fake (canned) garlic taste and other fake flavors. Oh man... It left me unsatisfied and disappointed. I should have known I couldn't scratch the itch to have good Chinese in anemic Charlotte. One thing I miss terribly about California is truly good authentic Chinese and Mexican. So I guess I'll stick with sushi, Thai and Vietnamese. But I digress...  Now I know better than to eat at Beijing again (though they have a convenient location and wicked fast service. I will head to Taipei Express or China 88 next time to get mediocre Chinese instead of blatantly bad (and possibly dirty) Chinese. Bummer."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews and saw a couple of things that were SPOT ON-  My wife and I have been here MANY times and have experienced the hostess/waitress/OWNER.  My wife would not allow us to dine-in here for over a year because of the way she treated us while dining.  Unfortunately for me, the food is THAT good..especially for  Chinese here in the west valley.  After a year of me sneaking over there for lunch and getting \"to-go's\" only for dinner, my wife finally gave us the green light to return for dine in....the only stipulation is I have all communications with this woman.  Knowing what we are going to be dealing with before we get there has now made our dining experience somewhat comical as we watch this woman work.  It makes us smile as we watch her interact with customers  that are not use to her behavior...worth the show to attend...I will be going back this Friday..Try the beishing pork chop sweet and sour style...AMAZING !!!!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for awhile now and today was the day I stopped to check it out.  The lunch specials cannot be beat at $5.99.  It came with soup, chicken corn or hot & sour, salad or egg roll and steamed or fried frice.  I ordered the beef with mushrooms.  The portion was generous, I could not finish it all and I have a healthy appetite.  The waitress was attentive and so nice, she stopped to talk to us.  I think she was the owner, I will ask her next time I go."}
{"text":"We've had take out from here several times and have loved it every time.   Great good and very friendly staff!   Hot and sour soup is a favorite!"}
{"text":"Our experience was totally different. If I rated on just the food, I would give it 3 stars; however, the service was terrible.  We come in, the waitress points to where we need to sit and she brings a high chair for us.  She asks us what we want to drink; we said water and from then on she just acted like a total B.  And I use this word quite sparingly so believe me when I was not happy at all with her attitude.  We have a kid, we know it's going to get messy so we are usually very kind to the wait staff so I know it wasn't us.  We order 3 lunch specials and all three should come with soup.  We only get two.  I asked about the third and she just seemed totally unhappy I even mentioned it.  I don't get it, especially since all the other reviews have been decent about their service.  Never got a refill on my water.  I think the hubby did once.  Never asked how we were doing.  They weren't even busy.  Towards the end she seemed nicer but the first impression was already made.  Maybe she just finished with a crappy customer or something.  I'll give them a second shot.  They are reasonably priced.  We haven't had a lunch under $20 (before tip)"}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible service.  We walked in and the hostess clearly did not want us to be there.  She brought us waters and rudely set them on the table and abruptly walked away.  She then sat in the back and ate her own food.  After taking our order she spent the rest of the time talking on the phone loudly at the front of the restaurant.  We were the only table eating there and the woman was acting like we were a huge bother.  There were also a few men working there that kept walking through the restaurant to smoke out front.  It was weird and uninviting knowing they were cooking our food.  The food was very good, however, I would not go back based on their unwelcoming and rude attitudes."}
{"text":"Great service and food experience sitting inside w/ my friends. Good quantity for the price."}
{"text":"Don't go here looking for the same stuff as Panda Express. They don't do spicy but it's dang good food all the same and the servings are huge. Big servings, good Chinese food and great customer service, a great place to eat."}
{"text":"First I have to say I have been visiting this restaurant for at least 5 years now, and have never had a disappointing meal.  I read reviews that say much to the contrary and I just have to laugh.  I lived in China myself for two years. The food here is the closest to REAL Chinese food, not Americanized stuff thrown together like a Panda Express etc. where they are marketing to Americans.    If you find that you do not like the food at Beijing, it is probably because you've never had it prepared like this before.  That's not saying there isn't a place for Panda, but don't discount Beijing if you've never tried it before because of that kind of comparison review.    For reference, I would say I eat at this place, or have had delivery, at least 12 times per year on average over the past two years since I moved back to Vegas.    Yes, their chairs could use a cleaning or redo; but having lived in China I recognize that this is just standard; but I am giving them the four stars for this as it is America and we do  have different standards.    Love the food! Would like to see a sprucing up of their interior too."}
{"text":"The place is small and clean, great service, with flavorful plates. The lunch special is $5.95 and the price is the same for their seafood dish. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Awesome place for great tasting Chinese food this was our first time here but defenetelly will return. I highly recommend this place food has flavor nor ur typical Chinese place. Our waitress was on older lady really friendly and on top of refills (^o^).. Come and enjoy it.."}
{"text":"Solid place for Chinese. Good size portions. I will agree with other yelpers that their side of steamed rice is very small. Prices are going rate about $10 an entree.  We ate in for a late dinner. We ordered beef chow fun, pork fried rice, and creaky chicken. They also gave us a cup of soup and a little dessert thing that was like a wonton wrapped banana topped with honey and sesame.  The chow fun was fantastic. The beef was super tender!! The other dishes were very good also. I was pleasantly surprised by the little sweet snack at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Three problems: 1) Little cup of rice is $1 2) Lady is mean, or a bitch.  Take your pick.   3) Family portions are small.   The food itself tasted ok, but I wasn't impressed overall.   Some of my guests left hungry.  We felt family portions should have been bigger.  Who charges $1 for a teacup size small rice? They do!  It's an insult to someone who visits asian restaurants frequently.  The rice should have been more abundant.  The lady waitress/owner was either oblivious that she was insulting, or really mean.  She tossed my credit card back when I tried paying with non-VISA card. She gave my wife an attitude when we wanted extra straws.  She gave me attitude when I asked for a to-go box.  On what should have been a busy evening, this place was nearly empty.  This should have been my first hint.  I came here because of the reviews but I feel some of you got treated better than I did."}
{"text":"I drove 20 minutes to get here because I had a craving for Moo Shu Pork. Their food is really good. We don't come more often because of the distance and in the past the woman there was not very nice but this time she was smiling and friendly. If that keeps up I know their business will increase."}
{"text":"Just finished Sunday lunch. Very bland. Soy sauce decanter was gross....sticky and crusty with foos. Waiter never refilled beverages. Only other 2 other tables of diners. Very disappointing. I've had worse but also have had much more flavorful even for a lunch special. Others had recommended Beijing to me but I won't be passing along any recommemdation."}
{"text":"Finally some spicy Chinese in Charlotte!    Szechuan Beef has a kick.  Fried rice that comes as a side isn't very exciting but the pork fried rice is great.  Egg rolls are pre-fab tasting.  But the pot stickers are huge and tasty!  Been back several times so this looks like a new standard for me.  They spruced up the interior design.  It's a fun dine-in experience or you can pick up.    Unfortunately they don't deliver.  But hopefully that's coming soon!"}
{"text":"After living in South End for almost a year, my wife & I finally decided to give our neighborhood Chinese joint some love. I'm glad we did.  We placed an order for takeout, in the restaurant, which was ready in about 10 minutes. Our order consisted off: egg drop soup, egg rolls, chicken & broccoli with fried rice & scallion chicken with lo-mien noodles. The egg drop was about average, I'd say --- I've definitely had better but I wouldn't hesitate to order theirs again. Egg rolls were pretty substantial and had a good taste to the filling. The brown sauce on the chicken & broccoli was bomb.com. My only complaint would be to maybe throw in a little more chicken & a little less broccoli. The scallion chicken, for me, was the showcase winner of the night. It wasn't your typically chewy/breaded mess that is Chinese fried chicken. This was lightly breaded white meat and had an amazing sauce to it. The le-mein were good, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $1.50 upgrade again to get it over the fried rice.  Overall, this place is a solid option for your Chinese cravings. The chicken dinner combinations (soup, egg roll, entree & rice) range from $8.95-$9.50 or so. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful, I ordered To-Go.   Got home, opened the bag.. Boyfriend was pleased with the Wor Wonton soup. However, I got the chicken corn.. there was two kernels of corn and NO chicken, we'll just call it Egg Drop soup. We got Pork Fried rice, it was bland and the pork was dry. We also got Beef Chow Fun, where's the beef? How does a plate of noodles stick so much together that it's just one big noodle? Gross. It was just covered in soy sauce and had no flavor.   Sorry, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Walked in the door and greeting was very rude. Then when the lady saw I had a service dog she refused to seat us. I try to explain the Americans Disability Act and she suddenly couldn't speak English anymore."}
{"text":"This is just your standard Chinese joint in a strip mall. Yes, the deal for lunch seems impressive at $5.99, but quality and taste tell the story. The hot/sour soup was lukewarm and had no taste, the egg roll was like a slider egg roll (very tiny, almost a one-biter thing). Main course was bland, but did have fresh string beans and the scoop of rice seemed to shortchange me, it was less than a bowl of rice. Staff was Ok, but nobody can speak english and as in every Chinese place, if you arrive after the lunch rush, the cook and family will be chomping down on their own lunch in the dining room usually right next to your table. Go set up a table and eat in the back. Very unprofessional, should have went to Rubio's."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food for great prices! I've had their food twice now and both times service was good as well as their food. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is so kind and personable! The food is well worth the buck because they come in pretty large portions! I've had the egg drop soup, chicken fried rice, walnut shrimp, sweet and spicy chicken, and their crispy wontons. All were very yummy! Also each dish does come with a side of white rice too! I think I've found my go to Chinese food spot! :) the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because when we ordered for take out, we weren't given any utensils or napkins :( other than that tho, love it!"}
{"text":"Great takeout. Really like the Hunan Chicken. It's fresh and love the bok choy and extra veggies they give upon request."}
{"text":"Better than I expected! I had the Korean version of fried chicken with hot sauce, so called Kkan-poong-gi. It actually tasted like my grandma's. So flovorful and crispy. The portion was huge as well. Definately coming back to try other dishes :)"}
{"text":"I have tried many different Chinese restaurants since moving out to Vegas, and have been quite disappointed in all of them. However, this establishment offered some flavor in their food that their competitors have lacked. I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, and I tasted garlic and ginger - 2 staples of the classic dish that apparently no one else in the city uses!  It still felt like something was missing, though. Maybe dark soy sauce? And the portion size was a bit small, and I felt there could have definitely been more chicken in the dish, but altogether I was pleased with my experience. The food was hot and fresh and ready very quickly."}
{"text":"Very polite staff and helpful. They are super quick didn't even finish half my beer and order was out. Food is very good and fills you up."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Beijing Chinese - aka Silent Chinese - a quaint bastion of flavor for those seeking the culinary experience of the great General Tso, or Kung Pao Chicken, or Lo Mein, or Fried Rice.  Service is always incredibly quick and friendly, with a soft-spoken sincerity that is unmatched in the queen city.  This is easily the best chinese food place in South End (though perhaps the only one).  Prices are reasonable, food is good, and service is quick, whether you dine in or take-out.  The place is so unbelievably quiet that you can't help but be amazed when the staff take your order at a whisper.       Try the Kung Pao Chicken - it's spicy, not deep fried, and has plenty of peanuts and vegetables."}
{"text":"This place is your standard American Chinese cuisine. Honestly, nothing too special about any of it. I must note, however, that the spring rolls are not too shabby."}
{"text":"Very difficult to find good Chinese food in Charlotte, or at least one that will deliver to my house. Wife was running errands, so she stopped at Bejing and figured we would give it a shot. My wife liked her dish (hunan chicken), but i wasn't a huge fan of mine (sa cha chicken). There wasn't anything wrong with the dish though. I tried something i hadn't had previously and just didn't like the flavor. I would try another dish at Bejing again to give it a second try."}
{"text":"Went searching for Chinese food on South End and found Beijing on yelp. The service was excellent, fast, and friendly. I enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Well I've been here 3 times now and had to finally write a review. Their lunch specials are great they are like 5 something for your entrée which is huge, plus soup or salad and a spring roll. Also while you wait for your meal you get those little crunchies to dip in the sweet and sour and hot mustard sauces.   So far I have tried their broccoli beef, mongolian beef, house special chicken and most recently the yellow curry chicken that I got for takeout last night. Everything I have tried has been ok. The broccoli beef is broccoli beef, the house chicken is NOT spicy whatsoever and they compare it to a general chicken but it's more like a sweet sauce it has NO spice. And my bf said his chicken tasted different last night like it had already been made and sitting out for a while. Maybe that's why it took literally 5 minutes for us to pick up the food after placing an order on the phone?   I was pleasantly surprised with the curry chicken i had last night.  It was delicious and had pineapple chunks in it! So yum. I literally didn't want to stop eating UNTIL I found a medium sized black hair floating around in the middle of my container. Boo! :/ Nothing makes me more disguted then seeing a hair in my food. Bleh. That killed it. I understand shit happens but I just don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"Our 1st attempt to try this new eatery was their 1st weekend and was a disaster as they were completely over-whelmed and we walked after a long wait without even having a chance to order.  So a few weeks later we gave them another chance and well, it certainly was not as busy and got to order in a normal amount of time.  The food thou was just OK, the Tasty Asian Kitchen is MUCH better and was again just OK."}
{"text":"Frankly the best chinese food I've had in a long time.I've lived in all kinds of places including Manhattan, Miami,.Washington,.DC....the Chinese food has complexity in flavor, very fresh for Chinese food, not greasy like most places, and you can taste a variety of herbs and seasons in every dish. The first time I went I knew it would be good because not only can you see the kitchen and see how everything is freshly made per order, the chef is an older Chinese guy, so I knew it would be authentic. The younger guy who takes your order is super nice and has a great understanding of customer service. I'm so happy I now have my go to Chinese in Vegas! Thanks Beijing!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese & so quick! Excellent food and service is great, very nice staff!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem in Las Vegas....Chinese cuisine known for their hidden awesome Korean menu and it's very authentic. Jajangmyeon is to die for here!"}
{"text":"Probably amongst the top three places in town for the spicy seafood noodle soup.  It's one of those Chinese restaurant that caters to Koreans with a Korean section on their menu."}
{"text":"I am sorry I have to write this review. My wife and I have been going to this restaurant for a few years. Yes we understand they need to run a business bubthere is a little thing called common curtesy. Over the last couple of years we have put up with the females attitude, she is the owner because the food was good and they are located close to our neighborhood. But the service over the last few times were bad and the last service we had a week ago was so bad we will never go back. First she seated us and would not take our order. She said when she gets to us that is when she will take our order. Once order was taken we asked for more ice tea. She said no only one glass per visit. Her husband came out from the back we asked him for more tea and he filled our glasses. While we were eating a mother came in with her children. The lady started off by yelling at the kids and told them to stay behind the carpet. Once they were seated she would only give them one menu as she told the mom her kids are to young to have menus. Even though they appeared to be between 8 and 12 years old. This upset the mom o she left. Other patrons in the restaurant were getting frustrated on not getting helped not getting food and even one table got the wrong food but she told them to eat it anyway because her cook made it. They got up and left too. We will now go else where for our Chinese food. We or anyone should not have to be treated so rudely whetting to eat at a local establishment."}
{"text":"Friendly family owned great service and great food! Prices are just right! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One thing to say about this place: the wonton soup is DIVINE! Best I've ever had. The food is okay to me but I really just come back for the soup. The waitress kind of scares me, but she's nice enough. Seriously, try the soup!"}
{"text":"$5.95 lunch special from 11 -3 daily soup/appetizer/ main dish.   What a steal!  The portions are quite huge for a lunch time deal! I ate all of mine of course.  Service is attentive and good. Endless refills of water for me in this hot weather!"}
{"text":"Today is my first time to go to this restaurant, and I was so disappointed by the service ( the old lady who always has a bad mood). When we just walked into the restaurant, she didn't take us to the table, instead she kept telling me to control my kids. What do you mean control my kids, B? They were stand beside the table. I'll give 4.5 stars for the food. But I told myself I will never go back to that restaurant again until the old lady is not working there anymore!"}
{"text":"The soups are excellent. The broth is made from scratch and has perfect seasoning. My wife and I each had a cup of soup, and then split the chef's version of General Tso Chicken. The chicken had excellent seasoning (spicy but not hot) and the rice was cook to perfection. Great prices, great service, lovely décor. I really enjoyed this meal.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and really like it. Dinning room is nice and welcoming plus never too crowded.  Staff is nice, seem abrupt but says something about maintaining culture which in I personally enjoy. Now onto the food, orange chicken best ever it's like real orange zest not some gooey sauce. General Tso's chicken great, great fried rice and appetizers. Skip the big expensive chains and give this a try!"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese fast food joint. I ordered the usual chicken and broccoli lunch plate with fried rice. It's comes with an egg roll. Since I hate Chinese egg roll. It's nothing like our egg rolls I tend to try to get the soup instead. But here, you can't substitute the egg roll out with soup which is a bummer.  Customer service is great and effective. They're tentative and fast. Perfect place to grab a quick bite during lunch.,"}
{"text":"It's your typical Chinese food, but it's done well. The portions are really generous and everything is high quality. One combo could easily be two meals for one person. The staff is great and service is fast. You don't ever have to wait over 10 minutes for takeout."}
{"text":"Food has great flavor...growing up in the Chinese restaurant business I know what ingredients boost flavor!  I love and their prices!! Delivery was quick too!!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch from them multiple times, and the food tastes great (I'm Chinese, I'm authorized to judge this).  That's not what earned them 5 stars from me though, the restaurant is about a minimum of a 10 minute drive from where I ordered, usually 15 minutes with lunch traffic. Somehow they delivered the food hot and fresh 15 minutes on the dot after we ordered the food. We make a game out of timing the delivery guy in his white Camry, a daring game in which his arrival beats our hunger."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a new Chinese restaurant. My husband and I were cruising down South Boulevard and saw grand opening streamers flying in the parking lot of Bei Jing Chinese so we thought we'd try it out.  The atmosphere is open and moderately, yet nicely decorated. I'm sure that being a new restaurant they are still working on making it a more warm space. Depending on the time you go, the windows are not shaded so you'll get the sun right in your face. In addition, as we were eating there was just something out of place. It hit me! There was no ambiance music; however, they do have a tv on the wall.   The food was good, not greasy or oily. The vegetables were fresh! The portion size was good. Service was friendly. They offer take-out and it seemed like that was the popular choice the night we went.   It's a nice little addition in South End!"}
{"text":"I use to really like this place and loved to get their food delivered. But this past Friday was a horrible experience. I placed the order total of 50.00 got our food delivered about one hour and 15 min later. I was so excited to eat since we were starving but all the food was cold!! I called them and said I know you guys are busy but there should be no reason my food  came to me cold. The lady on the phone said oh I'm so sorry let me talk to the driver and call you back. OF COURSE THEY NEVER CALLED BACK OR CARED THAT THEY SERVED US CRAP I WILL NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE AGAIN HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant for a quick bite before the airport and dude remembered a Japanese restaurant in this strip mall; however, now it is a Chinese restaurant.  So looking at the menu, we thought we'd give it a try, plus we were hungry!  Lunch specials were pretty reasonable but dude likes to share so we started off with chicken lettuce wraps and then had the combination stir-fried noodles.  Service was friendly and food was good."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant because it is a family owned business and we are now \"regulars\" that grandma knows what we want as soon as we sit down. Service is quick. I Like that you can see the kitchen and know that it's clean.  I go there for their hot and sour soup. This is the closest as far as taste for what I'm looking for. My favorite hot and sour soup is in AZ and every Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas has failed to compare except this one. I love their lo mein, lo mein is one of my favs and again this is the only place that gets it right. Spicy eggplant is good. Appetizers are yummy. Over all it's a decent place to eat. As long as they never appear on Dirty Dining it will be the only Chinese restaurant we go to. 4 stars because the decor could use some updating but again it's family owned. It is a clean place though. They did get new chairs recently."}
{"text":"will not go here again, as this place is nasty and found hair in 2 of our entrees. We showed them and walk out. Good thing we didn't eat anything before that.  We now have to find a new Chinese spot"}
{"text":"The taste is ok.  I did not like the chicken being deep fried and drenched with some kind of sauce, it was too oily and I did not feel good about the chicken as such.  The quantity was huge, but the quality was only ok. I had the Sesame Chicken and wife got a General Tso chicken - the verdict from both of us was same.  We  have had better!! It came with broccoli and white rice.  I was expecting fried rice though, but did not check when picking up the order and also it was closing time.  anyways, I really did not feel healthy about it, something was off."}
{"text":"Husband & I went here today before grocery shopping after reading reviews and I was very scared when I walked in, to be quite honest. We were seated and our waitress was adorable and friendly, very attentive but not obnoxious. We decided to go to lunch so if it did suck, it wouldn't be a waste of money. Anyway, I ordered the cashew chicken and my husband ordered the mongolian beef. We each got hot & sour soup and an egg roll plus our food for $5.95 + drinks. Extremely good deal and the food was awesome! Will be going for dinner next time and trying the seafood soup everyone says to try! (:"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I feel awful leaving a 2 star review for this place, especially because it's a family owned establishment and the little older lady was so sweet and was busting her butt serving the tables.   The last time I came here was about 2 years ago and I remember it being decent. I was in the in the mood for Chinese today for lunch, so I decided to stop in. When I sat down, I immediately noticed how dirty the upholstered chairs were. And I also noticed that the customers dining there, let's just say, we're not so glamorous. I decided to look passed that and just focus on my food.   I opted for the $5.95 lunch special, which includes your main dish, steamed rice, a bowl of soup, and a salad or egg roll. I chose shrimp with snow peas, hot & sour soup and salad. The soup was so bland and the tofu had a spongey texture. The salad was a sad plate of iceberg lettuce thrown on a plate. When I got my main dish, they accidentally gave my food to the table next to me because we both ordered shrimp dishes. No biggie, they just made me a new plate. I got my food and sprinkled some pepper on it. HUGE MISTAKE!!! The pepper had such an offensive odor that I had to scrape off the pepper I had just sprinkled. Even though I tried to scrape off the pepper, the bad smell was still there. The shrimp had a fishy taste to it, like it was old or something. I never waste food, but after about 2 shrimps and 6 snow peas, I was done eating. I literally left 6 or 7 shrimps on the plate.   Like I said, this is a family owned business and grandma was working so hard to take everyone's orders. I feel bad for leaving a 2 star review. Hopefully they read this and work to improve the quality."}
{"text":"This review is for dine in service.  Take out service would have gotten 5 stars for sure.  The food is good.  Everything is fresh and taste really good.  The service is not so good.  Staff sitting down watching the tv's while you are eating is kinda trashy.  If you need more tea or water you have to get their attention and wave them down in order to get refills.  That is the only part that i didnt like.    Would I Come Back in.....For Take Out No problem would i Dine in....Problably not."}
{"text":"First time there. I called in my (3)order. The order was wrong but he fix it right away. The food was good. I had the Sa Cha Shrimp. It was great."}
{"text":"Very, very bad service... I dont know if she had a long day or she's very tired or she's about to close and we came in, I don't know what her problem is, what I know is what she did to us is a very, very bad service. I'm actually generous enough to tip her 10% of what are bill is, usually I'm a good tipper (20-25% depending on how service is) but really she doesn't deserve it. Bad experience last night, we are not coming back."}
{"text":"Hadn't had Chinese in quite some time, but really enjoyed the General Tso tofu with brown rice. Magically ready in 10 minutes no matter what you order. Good for pick up or dining in and it's nice that they actually have some parking.  My only complaint is that you can't order extra veggies or a side of veggies even. It comes as it's own meal (veggie delight?) with another tub of unnecessary rice. Oh well, at least they do good work with the tofu."}
{"text":"When in a Chinese Restaurant for the first time I would like to know about Hunan!  When a \"Hunan\" sauce has black beans, it is usually a GOOD Sign!  If it has Bok Choy, Mmmm I do not need any more persuasion...  Asking about this one, my Waitress offered (without me asking) \"this one has Black Beans\"!  Hunan Beef Please!  The Beef was good, I do not know how they cooked it, I'm guessing a lot, though it was not over cooked, it was a preparation I have little experience with.  I got them to leave out the vegetables I do not like (broccoli and snow peas) and yeas it had Bok Choy... The vegetables were Very CRISP, unlike so many places, these were perfectly cooked!  The flavor of the Hunan Sauce was very good, not great, though it beats most places for this dish!   The service was very good!  My Waitress asked How i liked everything and I told her I did and she said \"but will you come back?\" I said \"probably not\"... Only because I would rather have Vietnamese, Thai or Korean (in that order) if it is Asian themed food!  For Chinese I'm giving them 4.45 stars because they are better than almost all Chinese places I have eaten!  Of  course I enjoy Vietnamese, Thai and Korean more, though I do not believe it is fair to compare!  For the price this place gets close to 5 yelp stars for Lunch!"}
{"text":"Love their sesame chicken dinner special! For under $10 you get a large portion of chicken, fried rice, an egg roll and soup! Staff is friendly, quick and courteous! I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend here recently.  I can't really say that I had anything that really stood out.  It did bother me that I was unable to take my soup home with me.  I normally only take eat a few spoonfuls of my soup then take the rest home to my daughter who loves it.  I do this at most Chinese restaurants I go to.  And I know if you order take out the soup is not included.  But this is the first time I have had someone tell me I couldn't take my soup home because it free so it can't leave the restaurant.  If they had told me that they don't have containers for me to take it home I would have understood.  But to say I can't take it because it was free to me was annoying.  Maybe I should have brought my own Tupperware.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"We have thought about eating here for awhile & finally stopped in tonight. I am not even sure where to start. There was no toilet paper in the Ladies room. When we asked for hot tea we were told it was $1 per cup, I guess it's not free at all Chinese restaurants. We asked for 2 checks for our party of 6 & were told that we would have to pay 15% gratuity. We usually tip 20% so she negotiated a smaller tip for herself. My husband ordered a Pepsi that he had to wait 20 minutes to get. The food was good & came out fairly quick. There was not enough rice. The waitress was rude & we won't be back."}
{"text":"A passable Chinese place, decor was nice and typical of your Chinese restaurant. Went on a Friday night and there were few patrons there although they seemed to be doing a good take away service. Ordered the Chicken Lo Mein, but want some vegetables with it, so I asked if I could have the Chop Suey (as it came with vegetables) only with noodles ?  Answer was...\"no chop suey vegetables, add vegetables to Lo Mein, two dollars more\", so, rather than have a language based dispute, I said, sure go ahead, I will pay the extra two bucks.  The dish was good, not great, but was a bit watery. It did have a good amount and variety of vegetables and the portion was adequate. It did need some spice so I asked for some hot mustard and was given it in packets.  Thus far Beijing Garden is in the Good category, but I am still looking for other Chinese places that have food that I can rave about."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive lunches. I've eaten here many times over several years it's always good."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Korean/Chinese noodles. It's still the best place in town for Korean/Chinese grub, but that's not saying much. Jajang Myun was bland and not enough sauce. The Gan Jajang did have more of that wok flavor that I was looking for, but it just didn't have that flavor we crave. The Champong was the same way. It was about 85% right with shrimp, scored calamari, and muscle, but not quite right with imitation crab meat and cabbage.  The main beef that my family had was with the noodles. It's kinda flat like linguini and didn't have a chewy texture. It was mushy. The girl behind the counter said they machine make their noodles, which is fine. Hand pulled noodles are rare even at Korean owned Chinese restaurants, but there's a definite difference in the texture from Korean machined noodles. That really took away from the experience.   But my two daughters got to try Jajang Myun for the first time, and they really liked it!(Sigh of relief). So I know I'll be back here with my kids."}
{"text":"I ordered vegetables and egg foo young both were so Bad I threw them in the trash. Everything smelled of old grease. Didn't notice until after I ordered that the inspection grade was a C, but this is no excuse for horrible food.  If I could have given it a 0 I would have."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's the best chinese around but they are fast, efficient and clean.  They offer a decent lunch specials menu for under $10 and because parking is easy, you can easily get in and out during lunchtime in under 40 minutes (if you want).  The dishes that I have had are cashew shrimp, moo shu vegetables, vegetable lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I was satisfied with all of my choices.  They do offer brown rice make sure you specify that you do not want fried rice."}
{"text":"I hate to give a restaurant a less than favorable review especially when the the majority of reviews have been positive. However,the food at Beijing Chinese Restaurant just wasn't that good.  What I first noticed as I walked into Beijing restaurant was how uncomfortably hot it was inside.  It felt as if the air conditioning was turned off.  I was glad I had placed a take out order.  The restaurant was empty but it still took several minutes for someone to help me.  The staff wasn't very friendly but maybe it was due to how uncomfortable it was inside.  On my first visit to Beijing I ordered 2 Seasme chicken lunch specials and an order of Beef Chow Fun.  The noodles and the beef in the Beef Chow Fun were greasy and tasteless.  The noodles were stuck together in a pile. The spring rolls were cooked nicely but just did not have a nice taste the same could be said about the crab puff. The Seasme chicken wasn't great but it wasn't the worse I have had.  I could not give Beijing Chinese a positive review but in a  pinch you could do worse."}
{"text":"I think the food is really good. The walnut shrimp and house special chicken is the best"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices and consistently good quality. They are thorough every time and have gotten my orders right every time. This place can be easy to miss on the very busy section of South Blvd, but it's definitely worth finding when you're looking for good Chinese takeout. No need to leave South End!"}
{"text":"This is the best cheap Chinese food you can get. Typical meals cost about $10 and there will be leftovers for your fridge. I am a regular and enjoy the General Tso Chicken (typical American). Give it a shot if you are just looking for some cheap, quick and easy takeout for yourself. I will also add that the staff is quite friendly and hardworking."}
{"text":"Ok food, ok service.  Had the orange beef and it was just OK. My had the dumplings and they were OK.  Had the hot and sour soup, and it was not good at all."}
{"text":"Went for their lunch special. Service was horrible along with their nasty fried chicken and tofu. Waited to be sat, no one showed, so we sat ourselves only to be told to get up and move by the grouchy waitress. She sat down and didn't bother filling up drinks until the guy in the back told her to get up. There was only one other couple there, so I'm sure she wasn't too tired. Then, after the horrible service or lack there of, she complains about the tip. Wow... we will never be back."}
{"text":"As I wrote previously the food at Bejing Chinese restaurant is consistently fresh and delicious. Today I had tomato beef with fried rice.  The beef was sooo tender and the tomatoes melted in your mouth. The sauce it was in was very flavorful. My husband had moo goo gain pan with fried rice. He loves this dish so much that he orders it frequently. We also had their pan seared dumplings. They were cooked perfectly with lots of flavor. And again I called my order in and it was ready when my husband picked it up. The people that work their are always very pleasant when I call to place my order and my husband says they are always so nice when he picks up the food. This is the best Chinese food in the henderson/las vegas area."}
{"text":"We have lived all over Charlotte and have tried many Chinese restaurants over the years. Beijing is our favorite. And the prices can't be beat either.  Haven't had a dish I didn't like yet, and their egg rolls are fresh and delicious (and I'm normally not a fan) service is great and for pickup orders they will have it ready in 10 minutes or less, usually."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are so cheap...less than $7 for chicken chow mein, egg roll, fried rice, and fortune cookie. The food is served quickly, the place is never too crowded, and I crave their food. One of my favorite spots in Charlotte for lunch, great value."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall restaurant has great prices and fast service. They probably aren't my #1 pick for Chinese, but they are convenient and I don't have to wait long to get my food. Their sweet and sour chicken is pretty great and I love their fried wontons."}
{"text":"Wonderful hot and sour soup, best I've had in the valley in years. Fair prices, large soup 2 dinner meals and 2 drinks for thirty bucks. Service just isn't good, never has been."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place when we want Jjampong and Jjajang myun.  Jjampong-Spicy seafood noodle soup, with a flavorful broth.  We have tried other korean, korean/chinese restaurant, and this bowl of noodle soup is usually JUST spice, not much of any flavor.  Here, you can taste the spice, plus the nice sweet seafood soup.  Note, the bowl is freakin huge!!!!!  Definitely more bang for your buck.  Jjang myun-noodles with black bean sauce, small bitty chunks of tender pork and shredded veggies.  Once again, have tried at many restaurants, but this place has got to be the best!  I love it here.  So yummy.  I started liking jjang myun because of this place.  Orange flavored beef-ok ok...I know, this might not be the typical dish that an asianized asian girl like me would order, but please read on...So anyways, I enjoyed this place's orange beef the most, due to the beef thinly sliced and nicely batter fried so that each bite, there is the crispiness of the outside and the tender beef  in the inside.  Other places that I have tried is unable to get the crispiness on batter, and worse, the chewy  meat in the middle.  That's no bueno.  I got this today  for lunch instead of my Jjang myun, but no worries, I will be back soon for that.    The lunch special is $5.95 for the entree, plus an egg roll/salad, and a soup.  In addition, they give you a small bowl of pickled daikon and their kim chi (preserved cabbage).  The kim chi complimented my orange beef very well.  Service has always been awesome for us here.  They are soooooo nice!!!"}
{"text":"i wanted to try this place the last time we were in AZ but never got a chance. tonight i dragged 6 of the 12 of us over to give it a shot. i'd only driven by it and it could have easily been fast food, but to my satisfied hopes it was sit down.   everything was really good and very fresh. the food was very well cooked, the fried stuff wasn't over done, and the sauces were a little bit thick, but not like that candy crap you get some cheapy places. try it out.. it's worth the extra buck or two."}
{"text":"Went here because I can pick it up on the way home. I wasn't expecting anything great, probably around the level of China Saute (from a years ago). I was very surprised! The veggies are very fresh and all the breaded chicken dishes are just right. It's not greasy or overly breaded.   I have tried about five different dishes and they were all delicious."}
{"text":"I came with a friend for lunch. Right away we were seated. I ordered the sesame chicken it came with your choice of soup, salad, and eggroll. I got hot & sour soup with salad. There was not many people in for lunch so out food came quickly. To my surprise the portions were huge for a lunch serving.  The staff was very attentive.  The food was good service was great. The restaurant was also clean."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Take out in less than 10 minutes. Ask them for the fresh Korean menu, it's awesome. Consistently good."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Service was fast, the food was tasty and served hot.  Server was very nice.  Decor was relaxing.  My Chinese date liked it and the food was cooked by Asians.  I've been there twice and had good experiences both times.  I will return."}
{"text":"Huge portions, cheap food, great service, and the food is good too! Stopped in when we found a coupon and it's a great find. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here now 3 times within 2 weeks. Every time the food comes out consistent and tastes good. Is it fancy? Special? Nope. This is a Chinese restaurant which does Chinese very well in my opinion. Oh, they are friendly too.  So 5 stars for the bang for your buck. I mean $6.25 for chicken fried rice (generous portion) cannot be frowned upon."}
{"text":"In my line of work at one of the biggest hotel-casinos on the strip I feel it is my job to try out as many restaurants as possible on the strip and off so I can refer guests to all the good ones. This restaurant is horrible as the Orange Chicken had an awful flavor to it. The Sweet & Sour chicken was bad too as the sweet & sour sauce was way too runny and did not taste like a sweet & sour sauce. I have been to many chinese and thai restaurants all over and so many here in Vegas but this one is one that will go at the bottom of my list. From a person with lots of experience for many years in trying out restaurants I would leave this one off your list. Don't waste your money or time!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  There aren't many Korean/Chinese style places here in Vegas.  The Jjampong (Spicy Noodle Soup) is really good here along with the Jjajang myun (Black Soybean noodle).  The Chinese food isn't bad either.  The service is friendly, and the price is decent.  It might not be the most decorative place inside, but the food is still very good.  Korean/Chinese style is different from just Korean and Chinese.  However, I think generally people will still like this type of food."}
{"text":"very good food. I like how the Thai ice tea is not overly sweet and the salad dressing here is good and light. very good customer service."}
{"text":"+Very nice interior; classical Chinese theme with some modern tones. +Calming place to dine. +Food was pretty good, made well, and usually served fast. +Good location; easy to locate and easy to find parking. -Prices are a tad bit high, even considering their ample portions."}
{"text":"I've been to more than my share of strip mall Chinese restaurants and usually leave feeling over full and queasy.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this place had fantastic service and the food was good without the overwhelming portions of rice and/or chow main a lot of places shove into a Styrofoam box.   We had real plates and cutlery and both the cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken had fresh ingredients with great flavor. We really enjoyed the egg rolls, which also tasted fresh.  The chicken and corn soup aka egg drop soup was the only negative. It was flavorless. Adding hot mustard, salt, and pepper helped, but not enough to make it worth it.  All in all, I wil definitely return to this spot when running errands  on Eastern during lunch."}
{"text":"It was very authentic and friendly restaurant.   The server was very friendly and genuine lady. She frequently checked on us to ensure we were doing alright.   The food came out good and their fried rice was great. Not so pricey and take advantage of the lunch special if you can."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Las Vegas.  I've tried many Chinese food restaurants and this is the only one I have found to call home.  Five stars for the following:  A) Food is absolutely delicious.  Always have to have my bbq spare ribs, shrimp fried rice, and chicken low mein.  Oh yeah and beef and broccoli.  B) They deliver!  I live in the southwest part of Las Vegas and they still come service me.  I always tip the driver good for making the long trip.  C) The restaurant is sit down full service and a place for a perfect date after a movie.  Taken the wife here quite a few times.  D) Always courteous and fast service.  I've ordered for delivery and literally gotten the order within 20 minutes before.  E) Accuracy.  I have never had an issue with my order and every time it's cooked exactly the way I remember it.  A great quality to have for any good restaurant.  If you enjoy quality cuisine and gourmet style Chinese, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and it sucked major. Friday night, dinner time and I failed at finding some good sweet and sour pork and orange chicken. Soggy and bland...maybe it was an off night for them, i don't know.  Try at your own risk I guess."}
{"text":"The secret here are the Korean specialties on the last page of the menu.  It was my first Korean specialty, and it was really good 'seafood noodles\" with black bean sauce.  Unfortunately, I don't know the exact name - I know big help I am! Maybe 'Jajangmyeon' but that isn't the name on the menu I know (now) that the spicy seafood soup is really featured and I will definitely try that if we get back here. The presentation was cool, a large bowl of noodles and the sauce with shrimp in a separate bowl.  Our server mixed it in front of me.  She seemed pretty happy that I ordered it.  The bean sauce was a little less seasoned than I expected, but it was very good.  Eileen had her usual- orange chicken, and it was certainly not overcooked, but could have been hotter.  Overall, very good!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, they get points simply for being open 7 days a week until a reasonable hour. What is up with places closing at 6 on Sundays? Who's done eating by 6? Sometimes I haven't even had breakfast by 6.  I am a huge fan of their Dinner Specials. You get an egg roll, soup, an entree, and a fortune cookie for under $10. Mine usually lasts me at least 2 days- that is, if I don't end up eating the leftovers the same night. (How do you distinguish between eating leftovers, and just taking a breather? How much time needs to pass between meals?)  I also, as a general hater of restaurant websites, find their website pleasantly well-organized and informative. Hours, location, menu, types of payment, tasty pictures of food, and printable coupons. Winning. They do deliver, but since I can see their building from my front door, I pick up. It's about a 7-minute walk and they always have my food ready to go by the time I get there. The only down side is I can't eat my egg drop soup on my 7-minute walk back home."}
{"text":"Terrrrrrible!  Horrible service!! We got to Bejing just a few minutes before they opened. Waited several minutes after opening time for them to unlock the doors. Once we went in we stood there and waited for the guy to come back to seat us. He said to us & pointed \" have a seat\". We sat down and started looking at the menu and again, waited for the guy to come back and get our drink order. Once he brought over the waters I ask what kind of sauce came with the \"chicken & broccoli\" because literally that's all that was listed on the menu. Absolutely no descriptions on the menu. The guys respond to my sauce question was.. \"Brown sauce\". Ummm okay? Cool.   I tried to eat a bite of the \"chicken\" and it was so mushy I had to spit it out. The rice tasted like boil in a bag. I'll just say that we paid for our food and walked around the corner to Einstein Bagels."}
{"text":"We have dined at Beijing twice in the past month.  The food is pretty good overall, likely the best Chinese cuisine I have experienced since moving to Goodyear three years ago.  It pains me to write this review but I feel the community should be for warned.  The first time we went everything was great and service was good with our two male servers.  The second time however was terrible.  The woman there was very rude.  She took forever to seat us even though the place was empty.  Only one other couple there.  After we were seated she presented me with a note and said \"you want to eat - you pay\".  The note said 15% gratuity.  I asked if she was joking.  She responded with \"you hog up my big table - you pay.\" The big table was nothing more than two small tables pushed together and the place was full of empty tables. We were a party of 6 however only 2 adults, 3 small children and a baby.  She added \"kids messy\" when I protested.  We weren't harassed like that the time before and were actually sitting at the exact table as before.  I told her fine but I wasn't tipping anything extra and told her she lost out because I always tip at least 20%.  She proceeded to insist I should tip beyond her demanded gratuity.  I felt like getting up and walking out but quickly realized paying her ransom was better than listening to my four kids cry because they were hungry and wanted their rice.  By this time we had already been sitting there close to 30 minutes.  Our food was served in a timely manner and was fresh however she served all of the meals incorrectly and would not listen when we tried redirecting her to who ordered what so it was like a game of musical chairs with plates of hot food after she walked away!  By that time another 30 minutes had passed and kids were getting restless so we decided to leave and take the food with us.  We asked for boxes and she brought two little ones and proceeded to cram everything into them.  I tried to explain that my mother wanted to take hers and we needed them separate and just to bring more boxes and we would take care of it.  She just ignored me and kept going but at least did go and get another box when she realized it wasn't going to fit.  She then brought the bill which was handwritten on a scrap of paper.  It seemed awfully high since we ordered off the lunch menu so I got out my calculator and she had not only over charged us for the food by over $14 but she added sales tax that equated to nearly 20% and then added her 15% gratuity to that!  When we questioned her she responded with \"no speaka English\".  She had no problem before when demanding her gratuity.  I explained that the bill was wrong in her addition, her sales tax and that gratuity is added before tax not after and tax does not include the gratuity.  She took the bill (actually snatched it from my mother's hand) went to her desk and brought it back offering an adjustment of just under $2.  Really?  For all you folks out there brave enough to try this place please be sure to check the math!  This was the worst dining experience we have ever had and we dine out together at least once a week if not twice.  It must been divine intervention because as we got up to leave my little boy knocked over his drink, flooding the table and floor.  I started cleaning it up but the couple at the table nearby who had witnessed the events of this nightmare meal pointed out that the extra 30 plus % we were forced to pay should more than cover it.  We agreed (good point, right?) and walked out and we will never go back again unless they get rid of that horrible, greedy woman!  Very disappointing as the food is good and the location is great for us.  Fellow diners beware!"}
{"text":"Food here is consistent.  Is it Wo Hops in NYC? No.  But it's a he'll of a lot cheaper and just as good as PF Changs."}
{"text":"Open till 11pm on the weekend - you go, Beijing!  We stumbled upon this little Dilworth place after me growing up passing it by (Dilworth Elementary Grad '95!!!).  The decor is boring, seating is limited and parking is odd (behind the building!), but the service and food were quick and spot on! General tso tofu from here was not only huge in portion but big on flavor. And finally, a place that hears \"Very Spicy\" when I say \"Extra Spicy!\".  Will definitely be coming back here for my late night Chinese fixes!"}
{"text":"My daughter had a hankering for Chinese, but being somewhat new to the area we weren't sure where to go. We Yelped and Beijing Chinese popped up not too far from us. We arrived and were seated by a friendly Chinese lady. It was pretty dead except for one other table. We ordered hot tea, chicken fried rice, house special chicken, chicken with veggies, dumplings, lo mein noodles. $43 and change.  The food was pretty good, the sauce on the house special was a tad salty although she marketed it as spicy-sweet, as well as lo mein was a pinch on the salty, but I'm salt sensitive, so someone else may disagree.  I'll admit my love of Chinese is pretty wishy-washy, it's not my favorite choice, this food is up there with regular Chinese."}
{"text":"I was glad I found this place. I went to a few places down the street from here and they were either dirty :cough all-you-can-eat cough: or over priced. I walked in with my fiancée and was greeted by a lovely older lady that seated us.The smell of pizza confuses you, but its just the pizza place next door!  I ordered the sweet and sour pork with house fried rice and my fiancée ordered kung pao chicken and white rice. The women informed us that the dinner special would save us money and would include egg rolls, wontons, chicken corn soup (side note: it taste and looks like egg flour soup with some corn kernels thrown in). We took her advice and was please with the amount of food we received.   We have been back 3 times since our first visit over a month ago.  Great place eat in because everyone gets the food to go, so there is no wait."}
{"text":"Very good taste n traditional flavor! Second time to eat here! Egg fo young really nice! It's a popular restaurant with great environment."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I decided to try out this place (mainly for the special :)) and it's close to our office. Service was excellent and the food was hot and tasty! I got the broccoli and mushroom with rice. Quick service, friendly staff, yummy food - I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming to see Alex and knowing his parents are making a great meal for me!"}
{"text":"Winner Winner Chicken Fried Dinner!  Thank you other yelponies for leading me to this glorious fine dining palace. I really doubted this place was any good from the outside and honestly the reviews pushed me to try and it really is as good as it gets in the Goodyear area.   My wife and I ordered the pork lo mein, the orange chicken, and the general tzou's chicken. All three dishes were decently priced, well flavored, and had generous portions.   The lo mein had the perfect amount of oil texture with strong authentic flavor and wonderful tasting pork strips.  The orange chicken tasted more of citrus then of spice which is my wife's ideal plate ( I had to dump chili oil on it, BAM, but it was very good with or without it)   The General's chicken did not surrender and was fantastic with the perfect amount of spice and seasoning while surrounded by well placed and cooked broccoli.   Dishes range from 7-10 dollars each most in the middle of the range at 8.95  The culture inside of the restaurant was nice and classy and reminded me of those trips overseas stopping all over Asia.   This is bar far the best I have had in goodyear and is more than worth the try."}
{"text":"Very good chinese food. The only issue I had was with the Orange Chicken and General Chow dish, as their chicken breading or oil tasted weird. The fried rice and Mongolian beef is MONEY!"}
{"text":"Foods okay, not a very good services so rude to customer and lunch stopped serve at 2:45pm"}
{"text":"\"If you're going to get Chinese, NEVER trust anywhere with a name like Bei Jing. C'mon, it's basic sense.\"  That was what my friend said after I described the terrible take out I was given. I didn't think I'd have to inspect the food before taking it out. If I had been dining in and had been served this? I would have sent it back and complained- a lot.  I got the Tofu w. vegetable. The tofu was sort of just added to the sauce (not prepared with it) and the vegetables added were literally the \"peas and carrots\" you'd find in the frozen section of a grocery store. Cubed carrots and strange textured peas. The sauce even had a strange texture to it. And then the duck sauce that was added to the bag was expired.   Awful x 2. I definitely recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"$5.95 lunch special including soup and egg roll.  They have the best sweet and sour chicken, beating any other restaurant I've eaten in (including Chinatown in San Francisco.  I have been here twice and the service is great.  I like refills on my drink and was always taken care of promptly."}
{"text":"We were worried when we were the only people in the place at 7:00 pm, but the food was wonderful and very reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"In the South Blvd area and was looking for take out Chinese.  Tried this place based on convenience and Yelp rating.  The restaurant has dine in options and decent parking spaces. There was a decent selection of items and combinations on the menu.  We ordered the chicken fried rice and chicken and shrimp egg foo yung. I was a bit turned off by the impatience of the man taking our order at the register as he didn't seem to like that we asked him to re-confirm that the chicken fried rice has onions but no other vegetables (peas, carrots, etc.), yet the \"free\" friend rice that he offered with our egg foo yung does have vegetables.  He dropped his head and stopped talking like we were slow. WTH?!  Then says \"I try to be nice so I offer the fried rice).  I started to walk out, but didn't.  In any event, our food was bagged with the patties separate from the gravy, and two additional containers with the two fried rice. There was also a greasy looking fortune cookie in the bag. Upon serving the food, the chicken in the chicken fried rice appeared to be barely cooked side. I braved it out and it tasted ok (I'll follow up with an update if I get sick :) ) The egg foo yung patties were rather tasteless and the accompanying gravy tasted like canned beef gravy - not good.  The \"free\" fried rice actually tasted pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend this place and definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Yummy! Being from NY I've had a hard time finding Chinese food down here that matches NY. I feel like I say that all the time, it's so hard not to compare everything to home! But I finally found a good place and it's super close to my apartment which is a big plus too!   I've been here a few times now and have gotten different things. The first time I got sweet and sour chicken...you can never go wrong with it! It was so good, crispy and crunchy and perfect with the sweet and sour sauce. The next time we got sesame chicken, again really good! Crunchy and just the right amount of sauce. I hate when Chinese places drench the chicken in sauce. It ruins it! All the sides were good too, egg rolls, fried rice, and wonton soup. Their wonton soup is made from scratch and delicious! The lo mein was just okay, maybe it was just this time but it was a little too greasy for my taste.   I can't wait for the next Saturday night movie night and Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is the place you go for fast, inexpensive and good tasting Chinese food! One guy works the front and two/three work in the kitchen. They word hard and it's good food. Great late night dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it is usually the same great experience. The food is always excellent and the staff is always attentive. I must say that I have read a lot of complaints about the staff and I must disagree. If you look at our behavior from their perspective, Americans are the ones being rude and obnoxious. The problem is that in their culture, it is more rude to say anything about our behavior than our behavuor is rude. Instead it is coustom to tolerate it and/or make it obvious by doing something rude in return. I understand that this restaurant is in America; but, we must understand we are in their restaurant and treat them with the respect they deserve.   If you want to make a good impression in order to have better service, I suggest the following simple rules: 1) Always take anything handed to you with both hands. Anything else is considered rude. In fact, you are basically telling them you are better than they are if you only use one hand. 2) Never allow the dirty ends of used chop sticks to touch the table. This assumes you use them; but, is the same for any eating utensil. It is a sign of disrespect to place the dirty end of an eating utensil on the table. Furthermore, it signifies you do not like the food prepared for you. It can also be taken as you do not trust them to prepare your food or several other negative meanings. 3) If you are adventurous and budget is not a primary concern, it is always best to ask for the lead host and/or chef to choose your dinner for you. If you do this, do not open your menu. Rather when the orders are taken, hand the host your menu with both hands and ask them for their reccomendation. You must tell them of any food allergies as well as what type of beverage you would like with your meal. For example, alcohol,  tea, hot, cold, etc... try not to be specific as it narrows their possibilities for making an unforgettable meal.  If you follow these basic rules, the staff will be much nicer and the food will be even better."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, food is always fresh and hot, they do delivery, and its fast. i have been a customer for about 3 yrs. and love their food,"}
{"text":"Food is good but they need to deliver! There are no Chinese deliveries around here. They would do so much more business."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant (preferably with take out or delivery) near our house for almost two years with no success.  I think we've found a winner folks!  It's located on the end of a strip mall (surprise, surprise) and is comfortable and clean on the inside.  The staff is very nice and attentive.  We wanted to test out a little of everything, so we ordered the BBQ pork, egg rolls, pot stickers, orange chicken, and szechuan beef.  We both thought the egg rolls were really good.  I thought the BBQ pork was better than he did and the reverse happened with the pot stickers.  The orange chicken had great flavor (real orange, not just a courtesy peel on the plate to make you think so).  It was a little heavy on the sauce, but we would definitely order it again.  The szechuan beef was good, but I would try a different dish next time.  We'll definitely be back and to try some new great things.  It's not the best I've had, but it serves it's purpose as a neighborhood go-to."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars here.  This place is within walking distance of me so I usually place an order over the phone and walk over to pick it up.  They aren't super busy all the time, but the staff are super friendly and I have not had a bad dish/order here at all.  There's a large dining room that is neat and orderly and the food often comes out super quick.  Being off of South Blvd, they have a small parking lot to the side and back - but you can't ask for a better location.  There menu is pretty extensive. The usual favorites you will find at other Chinese places but they also have some \"chef specials\".  Solid take out experience here too. They will include the utensils and napkins if you forget to pick some up on the way out.  Very efficient brown paper bag packaging and clear order receipt stapled on the top of the bag to eliminate any confusion."}
{"text":"When I'm not in South Park, I'm usually in south end or uptown. My friends and I saw Beijing while driving down South blvd one day and thought to give it a try. We went in for lunch and had a good experience...so we came back a number of times. Now it's time for me to give them props :)  The restaurant is very clean and well lit. When we've gone there (usually at lunch time it isn't super busy) and we've gotten great service. Very attentive. They seem to get a ton of business from takeout orders. I give a lot of credit to the servers because from what I've seen they're responsible for guests dining in and dealing with phone/takeout orders. Not easy to do. In any event the service has always been great.  The food...To be honest I can't really speak on their selection. I haven't really perused the menu too much. The lunch specials have been too appealing to look beyond them. I've tried a couple of things on the lunch specials menu and they have yet to disappoint. Not only were they good entrees, but the portions are big and they come with choice of Rice, choice of soup and an egg roll. I know that it's not uncommon for Chinese restaurants to have lunch specials which include those things, but it's always nice to get value for your $$$. Good food + good portions + sides for a low price = great deal.   Now to be fair, the food doesn't blow me away. It's good, and it's better than mall food court asian food in terms of quality of ingredients and taste, but doesn't necessarily stand out compared to other traditional sit-down Chinese places that I've tried. But I've always had a good overall dining experience there and the food is always meets my expectations. It never disappoints. If I could I'd give it a 3.5   I've done carry out from them as well. No complaints there either. I fully expect to eat there again."}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever had . After having their noodle soup I was sick for two days . I really hope the health department check on this restaurant more often . Worst service also. Save your money and stay healthy and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I work at one of the stores in the same shopping center and decided to try some Chinese on my lunch break. Since I only get a 30 minute lunch, I decided to call ahead. I ordered the pork lo mein with a side of egg rolls. They had my food ready and waiting for me when I got there. I was SHOCKED at how much food I got. The portions are more than generous. The lo mein was the best I've ever had. (And I am extremely picky) The service was wonderful and I have gone back many times for my lunch break. I have even recommended them to my co-workers. I love this place."}
{"text":"Its a nice place for lunch food was good...only problem not enough rice.."}
{"text":"Food fresh and light! Full of flavor. Best egg drop soup I've ever had! Jason had a full house and still managed to keep diners happy! Will come here for sure on my next visit to Phoenix! Kaari's new go to for Chinese!"}
{"text":"My mom kept telling me about this new Chinese restaurant that opened, so I finally met her for lunch there. She is taking classes at Estrella Mountain Community College and I teach English classes there, so this restaurant was conveniently located for us to meet up for lunch! :) It's just up the street, and the service is fast!  It seemed like most people were ordering take-out, as we were pretty much the only 2 people dining in. Another man came in and had lunch by himself, and as we were leaving a family was coming in to eat there. All others were take-out orders, but there were quite a few of them! Always a good sign, I think. The lovely lady who took care of us (I forget her name) seemed to be running the entire joint, and did pretty much everything aside from cooking our food. She was the only employee we saw the whole time, and she was acting as a hostess, a waitress, and was taking phone calls for take-out orders in between it all. To top it all off, she was also extremely polite and made sure we were happy/taken care of! Lots of refills, lots of visits to see how we were doing/how the food was, etc. We were very pleased with our service, and I was impressed with how busy she was. I don't think she stopped moving the whole time we were there, and she still had a smile on her face :)  My mom has been there several other times and noticed no difference in service than what I've just described. During busier times in the dining area (dinnertime on weekends, for example) they have observed the same quality and speed of service that we did during the not-so-busy weekday lunchtime. My little brother even liked it, and he's pretty picky! ;) I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely hated this place I'm a big fan of Chinese food and was really disappointed when I got my food. Rice was hard, sweet and sour chicken was bland, house lo mein had disgusting beef, shrimp was unappetizing I do not recommend this place. Highlight of it the waitress was really sweet."}
{"text":"I took my grandma and baby to this restaurant  for an early dinner. There was only one other occupied table. First, the owner tossed one menu on a table (two adults eating), second she demanded I move my grandma's walker to a different part of the restaurant even though I was trying to situate my daughter, who was not walking. The owner was brusque and unhelpful before it got worse. We ordered water and hot tea for each of us. She brought one of each. It took entirely too long to order considering there was only that one other table. Everything delivered to our table was tossed haphazardly and she stalked away from us before we could ask for another water, another flatware set, etc. Who treats anybody that way, but especially an elderly woman and a new mother? The food was never anything spectacular, which one can get anywhere. With service like this, we will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese (by Charlotte standards). One of the better General Tso's I've been able to find, though not quite as spicy as I like it. Always quick service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and had the $5.95 lunch specials! Service was great and food was excellent! I had sweet and sour chicken and boyfriend had Mongolian beef!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch, not really impressed.  Hot and sour soup had no flavor.  I got the lemon chicken and it was the worst I have ever had.  Just one big cutlet with very little flavor and a super sugary lemon sauce drenched all over top of it.  I may give this place another chance and order something better or get a dinner item, but so far I am still on the hunt for a decent chinese place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love their Won Ton and Egg Drop soups.  I also recommend their pan fried dumplings.  They are the best in the city.   Egg rolls are wonderful! Chicken fried rice is great too."}
{"text":"Very good general tso's, very clean, very fast service. Nice big windows.  Great lunch menu."}
{"text":"Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center.   I suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food."}
{"text":"If you want affordable and tasty chinese in South End, this is your place. It's nothing fancy, not the best food I've ever head, but it's always good and hot, and they are quick with orders - especially to go. My go-to's are the pork lo mein, general tso's + fried rice, and the won ton soup."}
{"text":"Due to location (convenience factor) I decided to check out Beijing instead of my usual fave Ho Ho Cherry House.  I ordered the Sesame chicken (extra crispy) and was pleasantly surprised that for 8 and change you receive a generous portion of chicken, fried rice, egg roll, choice of soup - I went won-ton, and even a little steamed broccoli. Ho ho cherry house doesn't offer soup or broccoli- so I was really pleased.  My order took only 10 minutes - and it tasted cook-to-order.   I really enjoyed their egg-roll's - definitely better than Ho-Ho's.They use more than just cabbage which is key. The rice was tasty- and the soup was awesome! I actually gave some to the girls that I was babysitting and lets say Ive never seen a 4 year old  down won-ton soup broth versus the chocolate ice cream in front of her!   Where they fell off the wagon was the crispiness factor. Unfortunately, that is kind of my main test for Chinese and the chicken just wasn't crispy at all. I would hate to see what it would be like if I didn't order extra crispy- it would have been mush! I also didn't care for the sauce as much as Ho-Ho's.  The sides were all cooked so well- and you can't beat the price or the location so I think id try it again and really stress the EXTRA crispy part!"}
{"text":"TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD     In recent times, I have dining here three times and in Christmas Day 2012 for lunch. I have sampled three entrees: shrimp with lobster sauce, pepper steak, and spicy eggplant. Two of the three entrees were delicious and one was ok. The shrimp with lobster sauce was delicious. The next time I eat here, it will most likely be the dish that I order. For the record this is the first Chinese restaurant that I recall in Vegas where the shrimp based entrees are the exact price as the other entrees. The pepper steak was also delicious. But the shrimp with lobster sauce was better, in my opinion. However, the spicy eggplant was ok. It could have been softer and tastier. Two entrees tasting delicious out of three ain't bad.    The lunch special is a good deal that ends at 3 pm. The specials go for $5.95. As I wrote, they included shrimp based entrees that are usually 50 cents more at the competition. The lunch specials include white rice, corn soup or hot and sour soup, and an egg roll of the spring roll variety. A cold beverage increases the lunch special to $8 before the tip.     As an observant yelper I notice a couple of things. The portions are smaller than the competition, however, there is none of the filler chow mien noodles that some restaurants fill half the plate with. This is the only Chinese restaurant where fried rice or brown rice is missing from the luncheon special. I could eat white rice as long as it has soy sauce on it. Its just that fried rice and brown rice are far tastier and when I go out to eat in a Chinese restaurant, I prefer the tastiest rice.    Beijing Chinese Restaurant is in the Eastern Be ltway Shopping Center. It is away from the Walmart madness but very close to the Eastern Avenue madness right off the Interstate 215 exit.    I rate Beijing Chinese Restaurant 3 stars, equivalent to a \"B.\" I'd like to conclude this review with a tip. If you catch the lunch special save your appetite for the German Bakery nextstore."}
{"text":"Had the house special chicken and it was amazing. Dinner was around $8 per plate. Very good portion for the money. If you go with another person make sure you each get something different because \"meat\" plates are placed in the middle and you get served a plate of rice to spoon entrees onto. No more being torn between two choices! But seriously the house special chicken was awesome. Fried with a little breading. (Think sweet and sour chicken style but better!) staff were very nice. Loved this place."}
{"text":"-Friendly service, very attentive, slow to bring bill.  -Food was average, a bit on the extreme salty side.  -Prices were a bit high, but they offer evening dinner specials for $6.99.  -Server talked us into ordering the Wonton soup-Large was $7.95 with skimpy portions (a few wontons, sliced chicken, tough beef, 2-3 shrimp, half cup of cabbage) and lots of bland broth. Not worth the price.  -Restroom clean, but no soap in Women's restroom.  -Decor was very nice.  -Parking is very convenient.  -Next door to a Barber shop."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly despite the dining area being pretty crowded since it was during the lunch rush and he was the only person working. I commend his ability to remain calm, cool, and collected despite many growing impatient including the table of 5 next to us. Our food came out pretty quickly since we came in right before the rush. We got 2 lunch specials which came with an egg roll and fried rice: shrimp with mixed veggies and chicken lo mein. It was basic Americanized Chinese fare which is exactly the description that accompanies it when you do a google search. Don't expect frills or anything gourmet to come out. This place is definitely the place to go in you don't want to venture out of South End and are craving basic Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at this place...was driving around and I decided I want chinese food and I saw the place....really good food..fresh vegetables and price is really reasonable.....$5.95 lunch special with Entree, Soup, Veg. Roll or Salad, cant beat that.....place was very clean and organized....will definitely come back...."}
{"text":"When the fridge is bare and we're not in the mood for pizza, hubs and I typically scan the Chinese restaurant menus. Since we're just around the corner from Beijing, we thought we'd give it a solid, college try.   We looked up their website (www.beijingcharlotte.com) and were pleasantly surprised that their menu was available online. We scanned through and ordered the Crab Rangoon, General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice and Beef w/Mixed Vegetables. What can I say, our fridge was reeeaaallly bare, we wanted leftovers! I wish their website offered dish descriptions of each item. It would be helpful to know what exactly composes Schezwuan Beef.   Hubs went to pick it up, as they do not have delivery service as of yet. A local food review mentioned that they were hoping to add that service in the near future. While I didn't pick up the food, hubs said that the place was decent inside. Nothing crazy, but a comfortable spot to stop for some quick food. Our food was ready in ten minutes - nice!   Once our Chinese feast was brought home I tasted each dish. The General Tso's was my favorite of all the dishes. It's not the healthiest menu item, but the chicken had a well-spiced sauce on it and it wasn't heavily breaded. I could have handled more heat, though. The shrimp fried rice was just ok, I was expecting more veggies and egg within the dish. It was mostly shrimp, fried rice and chopped onions. The crab rangoon was quite tasty but the beef with mixed vegetables was fairly bland.   I don't want to write off this place just yet, as their dishes were prepared fresh and none were greasy at all. I think I'll try a few new items next time and maybe ask for a bit more heat in my dish."}
{"text":"Honestly, the most substantial spoon I've ever used in my life. That spoon can easily hold up an average house cat. I can't get over it. Definitely go just to see the silverware."}
{"text":"Absolutely appalled by the lady at the front, who after reading reviews, I believe is the owner. I went in a few weeks ago and ordered a own ton soup to go. $10 for broth, cabbage, and wontons. I get home and it's barely filled half way. Figured I would try again tonight. I walk in, the lady immediately walks away. After standing at the desk for a few minutes she returns and says 'what do you want'. My of Mongolian beef came rather quick. The issue arose when I asked for some hot mustard and soy sauce. After she yelled at me that there was already soy sauce in the bag, I asked if I could have a few more. She literally threw the mustard at me, and gave me 1 more packet of soy sauce. I asked for a few more to which she informed me she already gave me some. I asked for more and she gave me 1 more and walked away. I said 'really?' To which she replied 'really'! I was perplexed by the whole situation. After I left I decided to call, and let her know that she was rude. She said okay and hung up on me. Never have I experienced anything like this. To too it off, my $13 Mongolian beef was slather in sauce and grease. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My first time here as I'm an out of towner.  Was going to have a sandwich next door, got on yelp, saw the for stats and thought \"eh, why not?\".    Thank God I did!  I was treated like a regular from the moment I walked in.    Garlic Chicken was white meat and an incredible amount of chicken with just the right amount of garlic.  The rice was perfect; sticky as it comes!  The chips served at the outset were crispy and fresh, not oily.  Refills came at the perfect time.  Cannot say enough about the table service from this family owned business.    Support this restaurant.  They will treat you well!  I certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Went there tonight for some awesome Chinese food because my coworkers said it was 1.) delicious 2.) inexpensive 3.) large portions and 4.) clean and friendly interior. They were 100% right and we loved our veggie lo Mein, veggie delight with fried rice, and two spring rolls, all for under $25 including tip and tax! And The wait was 10 min or less to get our food. This is officially our new favorite Chinese place!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly awesome unassuming little place. If you're looking for classic Asian food this place has it! Not only do they do Chinese but they also serve some Korean dishes. Wait staff is super friendly. Food is very tasty (we've tried MANY of their dishes and really like them all - haven't had a bad dish yet!). Service is fairly quick. We've tried a lot of the 'mom and pop' restaurants for Asian and this is the best we've found.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered here after receiving a menu and coupons in the door of our house. Language barrier is pretty rough,  which made ordering a long process. Food was delivered well before the 40 min allotted time but, we were given someone else's food. We had everything opened by the time we realized it wasn't our food because we had eager hungry children. Delivery driver noticed too and came back. Driver speaks no English, walked right into our home although we were on the porch, to pack the food we had already opened back up to deliver. We checked the order that was supposed to be ours and it was missing one of the items. He couldn't understand us at all and he had lost his phone. He borrowed my fiances phone to I thought call the restaurant but he walked out to his car with it and called his own phone with ours to find his instead. Then we talked to the restaurant on his phone at which time we couldn't communicate we were missing an item well. Finally we got that communicated and they said they would come back with our missing item after they deliver the other order (that we had already opened in our home). At this point I had already signed someone else's receipt so I had to sign ours. I didn't put a tip on the new receipt because frankly this was not good service. He pointed at the tip line indicating to leave a tip! Ends with, it's now been over and hour and the missing item hasn't been delivered. I'm pretty bothered by the idea they are delivering food we opened and checked out in our home to someone else- it feels wrong and we won't ever order here again. Food wasn't even worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Pretty decent inside atmosphere and I am very pleased with the quality of food for a good price in an expensive area. I habe only ordered take out here"}
{"text":"I love coming to place for their lunch specials. It's cheap and they give good service for a Chinese restaurant, a major plus for me. I usually have their Teriyaki Chicken and it comes with soup, sweet and sour or chicken corn.. Chicken corn was my choice then you have the option of having salad or egg rolls.. i chose the egg rolls. This is a great place to eat if your in a hurry and if your on a budget. Great value for a sit down restaurant, the service is great they are on top of everything. This is located on serene and eastern. try now.."}
{"text":"The \"Creeky\" dishes threw us a bit, but it's a place with good food, fast and considerate service, and very good value.  Their Hot and Sour Soup is the best we've found in the Valley and the dumplings are meaty.  One knock is that the food is not spicy for \"Beijing\" fare.  Bottom line: The value and speed makes this a great place for work lunches.  The good food is perfect for when you are just in the mood for comfort food and don't want to cook.  And the staff is very kind to little kids.  The owner couple kind of dote on our toddler daughter."}
{"text":"Ok, I've seen this place for a while now, and even thrown away the flyers that someone handed outside of Fry's.  Well, I was craving Chinese Food from watching Big Bang Theory episodes, and thought of this place.  After reading the reviews I thought, worth a shot.  WOW WOW.  I'm so glad I did.  So far, all reviews are accurate, place is not much, but you can sit down at a clean table if didn't call ahead and wait for your food, that's still only about a 10 min wait.  You could eat there, but I didn't see anyone, just people like me, coming, reading the menu and sitting and waiting.  Since I'm in the delivery zone, I'll probably never set foot in there again - and I can't wait to have them again.  Food was super fresh.  Chicken, beef shrimps, none of it was skimpy, plenty of the protein you asked for along with the freshest veggies.  I was skeptic, but all reviews are accurate, the freshness of the veggies really surprised me, they had a snap to them vs the sign they've been in the liquid a while, so it's great.  I can't wait to try more next time !  Definitely good to keep these small business open, great prices, good food, great location (for me) so I will definitely become a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This is for their take out, but I will say that based on their take out, I don't think I will be back. Be sure to check your to-go order before you leave the restaurant!! It will save a lot of hassle, as I had to come back twice and still ended up with the wrong order.   As for the food, it wasn't great, it wasn't memorable, it really wasn't anything. Their egg drop and hot and sour soups were so oily that they really were inedible and left a horrible stain on the plastic spoon. The meal that I ended up getting (which I ordered chicken with cashew nuts) was either beef and broccoli or chicken and broccoli but I genuinely couldn't tell. The fried rice with it was decent, but the only shining star of the meal.   I will continue to be on a quest for good American \"Chinese food\" here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The only thing that was ok is the shrimp egg roll that we ordered.  The fried rice is the worst I have ever tasted. Same goes for the chicken with garlic sauce as well as the general Tso's chicken.  We tried it, but probably won't be back.  We will stick with our favorite...BOADING!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Chinese food but only a small portion so elected to try out the Fried Wonton appetizer. It was very good. The portion was perfect. I actually ate it for my lunch. It was hot outside so I didn't want anything that would make me feel too full in the heat. It was perfect. I like the flavor. They were very crunchy and the filling wasn't too spicy. I did see that they offer luncheon specials which are very reasonably priced. I will have to come back when I have more time.   It was a small but very clean place and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This isn't a high end Chinese restaurant, but it's pretty good. The staff is always nice and helpful and the food is always pretty good. I really don't have any complaints"}
{"text":"A great place for chinese take out. The food is made fresh and has very consistent quality. The service is super fast and is ready for pick up in 10-15 minutes every time. I am consistently pleased with their take-out service. They appreciate your business!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a couple of friends on a friday night and had the family special, Mongolian beef, house special chicken, fried rice, appetizer, soup for ~30 with a BOGO bud light.   - Friendly and fast service. Although the dinner was only for two, the waiter gave us a free bowl of soup. No wait time, food comes fresh right away. - mongolian beef was not the best i ever had, but for the price, it deserves good ratings! - great beer deal!  ^____^ ^___^!"}
{"text":"Food was alright but the restaurant smelled unclean, and the gentleman at the front desk was very rude. I had one question about the menu and he was very short with me. They need to work on the customer service"}
{"text":"Really great selection of the lunch special, and it's only $5.95 that includes egg roll or salad, chicken corn or hot n sour soup, and white rice.   I got the shrimp and snow peas lunch special with egg roll and hot n sour soup.   You get the egg roll and the soup first. But I like eating my soup with rice sometimes so I wish they had asked me if I wanted these first or at the same time with the main dish.   Hot n sour soup was bland, kind of disappointing.  Egg roll was your typical frozen egg roll.   The main dish was really tasty with about 8 shrimps in the dish. Not so bad for $6  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Won't go back here ever again. Got boneless spare ribs for my first time there and they were terrible. Threw out most of the order."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times and the food is outstanding. Even the beef is extremely tender...I don't know how they do it. A smidge more expensive than your average place, but well worth the extra .50.  Service is laudable, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice, both time I really enjoyed it. Had the spicy seafood soup. Not spicy at all to me but maybe they adjust for different taste buds. It was still really good. The other dishes were also very tasty.  We had the ribs, woonton soup, lo mein all tasted very good.The one lady that always serves is really nice as well so makes me want to return. They have a buy one get one beer special, too!"}
{"text":"The go to place to get a quick bite of Chinese food in Southend. Call ahead or take a break inside the comfortable yet simple dining room. If you're on the run it is super easy to call ahead and pick it up.   Service is solid and we had no issues! The restaurant was clean and mostly empty. While we were eating there were probably 5 or 6 to go orders that came and went while we were dining. So I would say most of their business is carry out.   The soup was great. I tried both the wonton and onion soup and they were tasty to the last drop. The crab rangoons were phenomenal. A must try! They do extremely well when folding and making them! As for their entrees I was once again pleased with my choice. If you come in here and try something new that you don't know and it's not tasty to you that is not their issue. If you order something you don't like that shouldn't effect the rating you give them on Yelp!! Always best to get a description before blindly ordering something."}
{"text":"This place is actuallky called Beijing Chinese Cuisine now, not Hot Wok.  Hopefully yelp will get this changed!  So I found out this was an alternative Chinese delivery restaurant to Cook on Wok up the street on Eastern.  Also, if you spend 40 bucks, they give you a free entree so I decided to give them a try.  There were some hits and misses.  I ordered way too much food to hit the 40 dollars though and ended up having enough food for over a week.  The portions are huge.  Here is a rundown of what I had:  *Spring rolls - nothing special here but were tasty.  *Lemon Chicken - really overcooked and awful.  Had to throw some of this away.  Sauce was just grease and no lemon flavor. *Orange Beef - very very very overcooked but flavor was good.  Actually tasted really good as leftovers.  I prefer Cook on Wok's to this big time. *Sesame Chicken - this was the standout dish, really was one of the best sesame chicken dishes I have had.   *Shrimp with Snow Peas - Very well cooked and very tasty.  Much better than Cook on Wok's version.  Shrimp was big, and I was very satisfied with the medley of vegetables in this dish. *Combination Fried Rice - One of the better fried rice dishes I have had so far.  I would order here again but I would only order the sesame chicken, the shrimp with snow peas, and the combo fried rice.  The rest I would order from cook on wok.  I'm still looking for other places to do chinese delivery from (damn China a go go won't deliver down past Horizon Ridge)."}
{"text":"This is my review of 'Beijing Chinese Cuisine' (as other yelper mentioned before),,,the one right next to Sin City Sushi :P  I am very pleased to write this review(even though it's past my bed time-.-;;;;) I FINALLY found a great place to taste Korean-Chinese cuisine in town. I've been tried so many different places in the past but I couldn't find the one that has the genuine taste of Korean-Chinese dishes in Las Vegas.  I was highly recommended this place by good friend of mine to try some Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, and Mandu!   Growing up in Korea, I have early memories of eating Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, & Mandu all the tme. It was a ubiquitous dish, not to mention cheap. Occassionally, my family had ordered it for delivery, the delivery man would carry the food in a big tin box with handles, on a motorcycle :P The noodles came in actual bowls, so after finish eating our delicious meal, we'd have to put the dirty dishes outside by the door(usually don't need to wash the bowls for them), so that the delivery man could come back for it later to pick up. I assume this is no longer the case in the State, haha :D   Some people might ask,\"What is Korean-Chinese Cuisine?\" Well, it is originated from traditional Chinese dishes but has been influenced by local ingredients in Korea. Because of the closeness in place, most Korean-Chinese dishes are traced from Northern styles of Chinese cuisine such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shandong cuisine and these three are the best known regional cuisines of Northern China. Korean-chinese cuisine was born when Chinese immigrants settled in Korea in the 19th century, and 2005 marked the 100th anniversary of this popular dishes, according to wikipedia :)   Ok,, now the highlights of K-C dishes~  ---Jjamppong(a spice noodle soup flavored with all the vegetables, Seafood, meat, & chilly oil): You can ask a server how spice you want from mild to very spicy :) It was a perfect right amount of spiciness and rich flavor of the broth. OMG!!  ---Jjajangmyun(a steamed noodle in black bean sauce, with diced pork, onion, potato, & garlic,,serves with cucumber pieces on top): not salty at all, all the ingredients were blended well together and gave a perfect taste of Jjajangmyun!  ---Mandu(home made pork dumpling or goyza :P, either boiled-Mul-Mandu, steamed-Jjin-Mandu, grilled or fried-Gun-Mandu): I recommend these dishes to try with a dipping sauce of soysauce and vinegar that you can easily find on the table. I tried their Jjin-Mandu. I really loved their Mandu!!!  It was a real homemade dumpling that my mom and grandma would make it back home. It seemed like they put right amount of pork, cabbage, onion, garlic, scallion, Korean leek, clear noodle, tofu, & etc,.  As might be expected, it came with pickled radish (with a splash of vinegar) and kimchi, yay   The people next to me, they were looking at my Jjajangmyun and asked what I was having...All of a sudden, they put aside their menus and ended up getting the same dishes as mine. I was glad that they also loved their dishes admitting first time trying out Korean-Chinese Cuisine for them. The owner came by the table a couple of times and was very friendly. According to her story, she is a main chef and now she has been teaching her son to be a good chef of Korean-Chinese cuisine :) If you eager to have K-C cuisine that you usually tried back home or simply you are craving for some good K-C cuisine, go for it!"}
{"text":"Hungry for chinese food mid afternoon on a Sunday, the proximity of Beijing to my house made it rocket to the top of my list. After looking at the menu, we realized we could still get the lunch special (which comes with eggroll) and decided to order some appetizers. Super pumped it would be ready in under 15 minutes, but everything kinda dwindled after that.  We both got a chicken & veg dish (moo goo gai pan and chow mein), but since the only starch in either was fried rice, the only difference between ours was the vegetable selection. Yes, the sauce tasted exactly the same, like thickened water with a touch of chicken flavour. We also ordered the steamed dumplings, which were good but the top to the sauce wasn't put on all the way so we were forced to eat them dripping in pure soy and sodium. We also ordered a salad with ginger dressing (I know, I know, from a chinese restaurant) but the \"dressing\" was so thick it was just like eating shredded marinated ginger on lettuce. You win some, you lose some. And the eggrolls were HT freezer section material, definitely could go without next time.  I know we didn't chose heavily fried and sauced items that usually can't be messed up, but a good Chinese restaurant knows how to infuse flavors into even its lighter dishes, and that wasn't the case here."}
{"text":"For the nearly two years that my wife and I have been in Charlotte, we have been searching for excellent Chinese cuisine, with little positive results. We have finally found it in Beijing Chinese Cuisine.  My wife ordered the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce and I had the General Tso's chicken - unimaginative, I know, but it's my first time and I wanted to scale this with something with which I was already familiar. This was literally one of the best General Tso chicken dishes I had ever had -- every morsel was cooked to perfection. My wife's Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was just as excellent. She ate every bit, and this is from someone who normally carries half of her meal home for later. Yes, it was that good.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The place is small, but neat, just outside of Uptown Charlotte on South Blvd. We were seated near the window so we had the added amenity of seeing the uptown traffic and the people walking by. A large-screen TV was tuned to a kids' movie, which was somewhat distracting, but not badly so.  We are definitely planning a return visit to Beijing Chinese within the very near future.This experience was worth the 12-mile drive from south Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price  Guess its hard to mess up General Tsos Chicken, but you can't beat the price for the amount you get.   I haven't dined in as of yet (decent size sit down with not much to look at), and don't plan to anytime soon. 4/5 since the ambience is just ok"}
{"text":"So, one star is hard for me to give, but Beijing was an utter disappointment. Livin in the area, I love trying new places and Chinese, even better. So, driving home Friday night I spotted Beijing. Got home, checked out the menu and called for pickup. I ordered the Shrimp with broccoli dinner special which includes rice, egg roll, and your choice of soup. I chose the spring roll and wonton soup. I was quoted 15 minutes and when I arrived my order was ready. And, there were multiple people picking up orders as well as diners in the restaurant. A good sign in my mind, not! The wonton soup was brown, see photo. Never having seen a brown soup I was a little nervous and I was right, nasty taste. The rice was so blah and the shrimp and broccoli was covered in a thick brown sauce that has a horrible taste and the shrimp tasted very fishy. As for the spring roll, pure grease. All I will say is the fortune cookie was the only thing about the meal I enjoyed. I will definitely not be back. Bummer, because it is convenient to me."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken with Broccoli as takeout last night.  The lid was not put on tight enough.  Some of the sauce spilled out of the container and out of the brown bag onto the floor board of my car.  Upon getting out of my car, the container popped open and sauce went everywhere!  I was holding the brown bag as I was supposed to (how they give it to you in the restaurant).  Also, the chicken with broccoli was not good at all.  I will not be back"}
{"text":"Terrible for pick-up! Waited five minutes on hold after calling for 10 minutes to busy signal, got order completely wrong , then had to wait another 20 minutes on hold w phone on counter while listening to them take walk-in orders and seat people. Fried rice tasted like shrimp but was supposed to be regular fried rice. Omitted main dish from order and Then they hung up the phone without asking what we needed. Horrific!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, considering there is a severe shortage of cheap Chinese place near my work. My coworker and I came here the other week for a quick to-go order. I had the tofu with veggies lunch combo ($5.95). The brown gravy was so thick I couldn't even get it to spread over the rice.  Someone went a little heavy handed with the corn starch. It tasted ok for how bad it looked.  I love the tofu, the portion was ok, the best part of the lunch was probably the spring roll.  I seriously hope the gravy problem was a one time thing, yet it will be a while before I go back to find out.  The sad part is the gentleman who greeted us and took our order was super nice and said he wanted to see us back..."}
{"text":"Yelp fail!  Food: lunch specials. Got the shrimp with snow peas and the Kung pao chicken. Both came with soup (opted for corn chowder), egg roll and rice (opted for steamed rice).  The soup was bland, the egg roll was basic frozen, but the worst offense was the steamed rice. So inedible. It was dry and tasted 2-3 days old. The shrimp entree was too salty and the chicken dish did not have much chicken and was in a nothing brown sauce.   This is not Chinese food and even for Americanized Chinese food you are better off at Panda Express!   Service: friendly and the woman's English was surprisingly good. Hence the one star.   There was no one else eating there on a Friday at lunch time. Bad sign. After we left I was praying we would not get sick (luckily we did not.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in while running errands.  They had 2 dinner specials so we had both.  The entrees were excellent with lots of meat (not all filler).  A great find."}
{"text":"Ordered Hunan chicken and hot and sour soup for takeout tonight. When I got home, there was barely any chicken in my dinner entree - it was mostly undercooked vegetables and the fried rice tasted like plastic... typically not a picky eater but the food I received tonight was absolutely disgusting. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Accidentally ordered food from another Chinese restaurant and showed up here to pick up my food.  The manager fired out my entire order in 10 mins. So thumbs up for service.  Food was fine and price was good."}
{"text":"Decent food, but not worth going out of my way for.   I started off on the wrong foot with this place after ordering take out online and them not having my food ready. Apparently if you place the order online before they open, they won't get the online order. Anyway, I ordered 2 lunch specials - mongolian beef and spicy eggplant. The spicy eggplant was good, but I feel like it's hard to mess that dish up. The mongolian beef on the other hand was sub-par. It was essentially all onion, with the occasional piece of meat. The lunch specials are $5.95 and include a generous entree portion, white rice, and a tiny egg roll. Soup is included when you dine in, but it's about a $1 extra for take out. All in all, a pretty good deal.   I'd be willing to give this place another shot and try something different, but like I said, I won't be making any special trips here."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss here.  They still have $5.95 lunch meal and it's pretty filling.    I was pretty impressed the first time that I ordered my Mongolian beef.  My food cooked the way I requested, since it was cook to order. Fast forward a couple of weeks, I asked for my food to be low sodium.  Holy mother of salt and spiciness, that it did not taste good at all.  I saw the chef change shifts and I think that was the problem there."}
{"text":"First thing that grabbed my attention was the very friendly staff... That eventually turned into awkwardness throughout our meal.   Came here on a whim, on a Thursday night. There was a few other people inside, just enough to see that it wasn't doing terrible with business. Sat down and was greeted by a nice Asian lady, we ordered the veggie spring rolls, teriyaki chicken, and after much confusion with a language barrier, also ordered the Singapore noodles.   The food was fine, nothing special, and actually the sweet & sour sauce was actually terrible and extremely artificial tasting. Like kool-aid or something. But the thing that stuck with me the most was the staff, and probably not a great way. I don't know if he was the owner, manager, or what.... But there was this older white man walking around to tables asking how everything was and confusing many people like me. He wasn't in any sort of uniform or anything- just your average Joe.   Also, our waitress was hovering around our table watching us like a hawk to see if we needed anything else at all, and wasn't afraid to share her opinion on the food we were eating (at one point she almost touched our food during her excitement to explain everything). That's where all the awkwardness comes in. But besides that, it's not bad, not really that great either, but... Not bad."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious food at a good price. The waitress was very nice and made sure that my diet coke never ran dry. The glass was small (only a dollar for a soda though, that's a really good deal), so I emptied it like, 6 times.   There was a good amount of food for what I paid."}
