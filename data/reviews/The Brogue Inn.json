{"text":"4.5/5!

Hands down, my favourite pub in Mississauga! 

We went for 8pm (party of 5) and had an awesome waitress (who, by the way, is crazy good with orders...wrote absolutely nothing down even if we wanted to make switches). So, drink orders were done first and shortly after we ordered our meals, which arrived within 10 minutes. Here is what was ordered with their reviews: cheesy garlic bread ( four pieces shared between four of us; pretty good) steak (deliciously juicy and prepared on a bed of mashed potatoes, asparagus, and assorted steamed veggies), sweet potato fries (HUGE portion even though it's a side dish and comes with a homemade ranch dip; delicious), chicken wrap with fries (yummy and also huge portion), beef dip with fries (thinly sliced beef on kaiser bread with dip on the side; this was mine and I seriously loved it....I couldn't make it past finishing the sandwich itself but tasted some of the fries and they were delish), and chocolate lava cake (also very yummy and is served warm with a little plate of ice cream and whipped cream).

So, the food is amazing but at what cost? Actually, prices were pretty fantastic. For large portions of food, each dish was just over $10 (excluding the sweet potato fries and chocolate lava cake which were about $7). 

The ambience of the pub was very vintage and authentic, warm and cozy and music level wasn't too loud but that's probably cause we didn't stay too late. 

Recommend. Find your way there soon :)"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a pub down town port credit; we have been here a few times resulting in zero complaints, great atmosphere and decent service.

Chicken curry is quite spicy and delicious - definitely recommend for those who can appreciate a hot & spicy dish

Beef pie was also delicious, crust was soft and consistent. Definitely recommend this pub favorite."}
{"text":"The Brogue is our Friday night destination...the food is excellent, the wines amazing, and the service...superb....the entire atmosphere is unique which makes you come back....do not miss it"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! The nachos are out of this world. Can't help but hear the Cheers theme song when I enter this place. Food is great, never had any issues with my order."}
{"text":"I'll start by mentioning that this place has very poor air circulation and unreliable air conditioning so certain sections towards the back are very hot and stuffy. The service was good and the food was not bad. I had a fish Burger which consisted of a slightly over cooked piece of battered fried fish on a grilled bun with tartar sauce and veggies. The Burger came with big giant fries that, although not fresh cut, were pretty good."}
{"text":"Irish breakfast is a battle of good versus evil. It was a delicious tie. Will do battle again with thick pea-meal bacon and the blood pudding, which I understand can be addictive."}
{"text":"We live close by and come here once a month. love their comfort food. Nice staff, willing to accommodate changes in the orders."}
{"text":"This bar is a staple for my father and I.  I am never disappointed, food is always on point and service is great!!! Fresh halibut is amazing and their chicken club is ridiculously good. Amazing imports on tap! Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"The menu on their website has not been updated to include the much-higher prices you get in person at the bar. A plate of veg nachos now costs $17. That's a huge mark-up, and it wasn't like the biggest plate of nachos or anything. Oh, and here's the kicker, we had to pay $2 for some extra salsa. What the hell? The service was good and I liked the ambiance of the bar, but I can't go there and get gouged like that again for chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the brogue. There's some things I like a lot, and others that I simply can't stand.

I like that the brogue tries to be authentic, down to even their servers with true brogan accents (in some cases anyhow). The dining room is nice, the bar area is nice (there are two). This isn't a place I'd ever come to for drinks, but certainly a meal.

With that being said, not everything on the menu is worth ordering. The fish and chips suck. Greasy, break apart like nothing. I like the Jacko burger. It however is not without flaw. The Jacko is notorious for coming slightly undercooked, and it's a little bland. Other than that it's perfectly fine. The fries are alright, nice with gravy. The true star of the show however, are the mashed potatoes. These are quite likely the worst mashed I have ever eaten. Feeding them to a dog would be insulting (to the dog).

The food is simply just okay. As the category suggests A-ok. It may have been a little generous... should I change it to 2 stars? I can't decide, it'll stand.

Decent place with decent food, give it a go if you like that irish pub style."}
{"text":"The Brogue Pub is hit or miss.

My boyfriend's hockey team, along with any cheerleaders in the crowd that night, comes here a couple times a month for the beer and wings deal. $6 for a pound of wings with the purchase of a drink on Monday and Tuesday nights.

They also have sporadic pub quizzes (check their website for dates) and do pub breakfast on the weekends. 

Sometimes our group of 10-15 is warmly welcomed, and the service is friendly...other times they look annoyed that we're there and do things like sigh loudly when someone asks to hear what is on tap. Those nights you get to play the 'what's on tap' game. Keiths Red? Nope. Coors Light? Nope.... you know what I'm talking about. 

Despite the unpredictable service they do fairly well with the large group in terms of efficiency, not messing up orders (too much) and dividing the bills up. The wings are alright. There are televisions everywhere and it's a big space (two rooms) so we never have trouble finding a table."}
{"text":"With the departure of The Harp, The Brogue is now the official Irish pub in Port Credit. Having been here time and time again for a quick pint or bevy, I've come to recognize it as a solid watering hole, and spot to get drinks. However, it wasn't until today, when I had an early meeting in the area over lunch that I got to try their food out.

Before getting into the food, I will say a few words about the venue itself. The Brogue has prime real estate in Port Credit, located on the intersection of Hurontario and Lakeshore, it's really the first thing you see as you enter the town from either the north or the east.

The outside recently had a bit of facelift and it's made a word of difference. Don't get me wrong an Irsih pub still looks like and irish pub, but a little spit-shine and some new signage makes a world of difference. It's definitely more inviting than it was.

The inside is deceivingly large, I tried 3 different locked doors to get in before finally finding the main door off of Lakeshore. The bar area alone is huge but that connects onto even larger dining areas and even a small stage for performances - an essential part of any good Irish pub.

Today for eats I hadn't had breakfast yet and on Sunday at least Breakfast is available until 3pm so that's a win for me. I went with the Popular Irish Fry and added extra meat and eggs for good measure. The Fry comes with 2 eggs, toast, hashbrowns, blood sausage, irish sausage, strip bacon, pemale bacon and a fried tomato. Not bad for the price, and me being a greedy buffoon meant I got double everything and was having trouble breathing as I left. The only part of the dish I wasn't really a fan of was the Irish sausage, they were cooked very well and were MASSIVE, just not my cup of tea  (preference more than anything).

Overall a good spot, and I bet it's somewhere where everybody knows your name really fast.

Looking forward to my next pint of Guinness here!

{"text":"In Toronto to meet a business colleague, he suggested this place and as I had never eaten here before I agreed.  I was not disappointed. You might think it is one of those fake Irish pubs with a marketing-hacks made-up-name but no, it is family owned by real people and not a corporate logo. It's a large place inside and I wanders through three sections before finding my friend. The service is fast and friendly and I had a Kilkenny. I ordered a burger with cheese and bacon with sweet-potato fries. As soon as I saw it I could tell it was made in house. The burger was not all perfectly round, it had a great thickness and meaty-gnarliness to it that was complemented by the salty bacon, creamy Havarti and sweetness of the potatoes, actually some of the best sweet-potato fries I've had recently, slim, crisp, hot and with that just to-the-tooth resistant crunch that gives to the soft flesh inside. The accompanying bun was actually perfectly toasted, with a great dark brown crust. My friend had the chicken curry and whilst not a traditional pub curry, it was a very good fusion of Indian and Asian style curries. The menu is not overly long and my friend says he has eaten here a lot as it is just down the street from his dojo and everything is decent pub-grub."}
{"text":"We have been driving by for years and finally stopped in to give it a try. Much bigger and nicer than it appears from the outside. The food was absolutely amazing and the server was quite friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend it for those days when you want a nice meal with a homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very good service.
This is a local haunt for me and we dine here with family and friends quite often. 
The food is quite traditional and none the worse for that. Bangers and mash or fish and chips, a great burger or a succulent steak, as well as many other options, all freshly prepared and served with a true Irish welcome.
If you fancy a Sunday brunch this is the place. The Irish breakfast is amazing with black pudding, pea meal and back bacon, exquisite sausage and all the trimmings. If they served  Marmite with the toast I would die happy, but I could bring my own..
The dining area is quieter than many restaurants and pubs, and more conducive to conversation. It is a popular dining spot for many locals and visitors.
This is an honest Irish bar, run by a real Irish family. Beware of imitation chain pubs.
At night this place can be busy, and on Paddy's Day it is absolute mayhem with queues around the block!"}
{"text":"Out in Toronto for work and decided to try this place out with my coworker. Nice place. Server was polite and friendly. Food came out piping hot. I had the beef stew pie with mash potatoes. My coworker had the chicken curry with nana and rice. He loved. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Brunch review

Pluses
Good portions not a bad variety of items.
Food is served pretty promptly 

Cons
Service while friendly lacks a bit...no offer of coffee top up or water unless asked.
Have to flag down to get bill.
It wasn't very busy so that wasn't it."}
{"text":"So for review number fifty (took me long enough) I think it's probably appropriate that I check out someplace that I actually care about rather than just a corner gas station. So I think for this momentous (!!) milestone I'm going to have to finally get around to reviewing local neighbourhood pub of choice, The Brogue Inn. It's my favourite watering hole near where I live in Port Credit and if you live in the area and haven't dropped in for a pint and a bite, do so soon!

It's one of those fancy and highly stylized looking Irish pubs (I'm sure you know the type) with your standard selection of domestic, premium and imported (i.e. standard Irish) beers on draught. The menu may be your typical pub fare but the quality really is quite high and they really do have an impressive array of options. There also have their weekend specials and though I usually can't sample any of them (on account of my vegetarianism) they really do seem quite impressive.

As for what I can eat, the potato skins are quite yummy and the pastas are much better than one would usually expect from an Irish pub. My personal favourite (being a vegetarian) is their very tasty and amazingly cheap (only $8.99) burger. It comes with their very tasty fries and cheese is included. It would be a steal even if wasn't so yummy...hopefully they don't read this and jack the price up on me! My fiancée recommends the Bangers & Mash, especially if you're looking for a good, solid meat & potatoes dish (literally).

Again the beer list is pretty standard, so no cask ales or micros but you're content with a cold pint of Guinness or Smithwick's, you're golden. Also the quality of the cocktails is noticeably higher than that of most similar places. Granted it always depends on the bartender but they've never mixed me up a bad Manhattan and I appreciate that. 

So while The Brogue may not be as impressive as some of the gastropubs or more fancy places you'll see in Toronto, I prefer it to Failte or any of those Firkin places or pretty much any place of that ilk. It has a good vibe, solid service and is my first choice for a bite and a beer in Port Credit."}
{"text":"Nice Pub to come in and grab a drink with some friends. They have a good beers on tap and its a quiet atmosphere for a low key evening. This is a good place come if you're looking to grab a drink but every other place is full."}
{"text":"Irish pub, Irish owned/operated, Irish beers, Irish attitude.

This place is kind of great and also kind of meh. The beers are all what you'd expect form a legit Irish pub. The prices are also as expected. The insides of the building are dark and gloomy, but that's usually counterbalanced by the clientele who are often yappin' about sports or telling stories or hollering jokes across the bar. The service can be downright gruff. I've always found them a bit off-putting. On the other hand, the pub food is good. I like this spot because it's the most laid back and quiet of all the Port Credit bars, which goes a long way when you're looking for a dark corner to enjoy some brews and conversation without an earful of classic rock drowning out the fun."}
{"text":"Does not disappoint - good, fresh food, great service and you can hear yourself talk!"}
{"text":"Best pub in PC, the food is fabulous ! The wings are soooo good. The staff are so friendly and always attentive. Always feel at home here :)"}
{"text":"Great pub with a fine selection of draft beers and excellent food.  Perfect Port Credit location.  First rate live Celtic music on a Thursday night!  Band plays Celtic and more actually!!!   Been here twice and I'm a fan.  Awesome location near the lake and a short walk from go station.  Staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Great Irish Pub in the center of Port-Credit, Mississauga. Food is great, good mashed potatoes. Reminded me of my Mom's traditional Irish cooking. Pints are reasonably priced. Apple tart for dessert was amazing. 7$ but worth every penny. I  definitely will come back here in 2016."}
{"text":"The food is alright, but I keep finding myself going back. Most likely due to the relaxed atmosphere. You can tell everything they serve is frozen foods and a few times my vegetables were still cold in the middle. I will probably be back yet again :)"}
{"text":"After Gord and I left the Harp Pub, we stopped in at the Brogue Inn for a drink before we had to catch our GoTrain home (it's just a couple blocks south of the GoTrain station)

We'd been there in April 2010 for a friend's birthday party and enjoyed it.

As usual, we sat at the bar. The bartender took good care of us.

There were quite a few people there. There was a guy enjoying a beer and working ... he had a huge pile of paper in front of him he was going through.

It's a fairly big place. There is another room on the side.

Alas, we had to leave to catch our 10:43pm GoTrain. 

It's a comfortable place to have a beer and a bite to eat ... I'd stop in again."}
{"text":"Lovely pub, big layout. Good food. Good music. Lovely staff. What more do you want??"}
{"text":"Go for the wings - stay for the company! 

Great pub in Port Credit run by the Donnelly family. Very friendly staff and crowd. Food is great (although I may be biased, I continually order the wings). Great place to kick back, unwind and have a pint (or two!)"}
{"text":"A stinging slap to the face of all the \"faux\" Irish pubs littering our streets. This place is the real deal. Amazing food, great beer selection, friendly service."}
{"text":"The staff here is just phenomenal, and the food never disappoints! Admittedly, I've eaten a few too many orders of mozzarella sticks, but I can assure you, you'll find something that's delicious (even if it's not deep fried).  They make a great benny for brunch, and their steak sandwich is amazing!

What I really like about this place, though, is the atmosphere.  I think that you can always tell the true quality of a restaurant/bar by how many regulars they have.  There's about 95 of them *constantly* in there and the staff all know exactly who they are and greet them like family.  I like feeling comfortable and welcome, and this place provides exactly that!

In closing - I live way too close to this place for comfort and I constantly have to talk myself out of spending every night here!  You should go!"}
{"text":"This past Canada Day I supped here with three friends. It seemed like a nice area to take in a modest fireworks show and a good excuse to see my pal's new place. I was right. 

For dinner here I had the meat pie and a lot of reasonably priced red wine. I love the nine ounce pour option. It just makes sense. 

The pie itself was good, though the sides were sort of meh. Before ordering, I asked the server what they'd recommend to eat between the pie and a few other things, and then she continued to tell me how she thought meat pies were disgusting. Myself, being ever a stubborn goat, and generally a large fan of meat in pastry ordered the meat pie to fly a rebel flag in this woman's face. Again, the pie itself was flaky, pea-filled and delicious. 

Anyhow, the great pie debate aside, this place is A-OK."}
