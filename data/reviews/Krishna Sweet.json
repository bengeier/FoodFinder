{"text":"This place has really good indian sweets and the freshest samosas in town. Very good service and reasonable prices. Saturdays they have a lot more varieties, so that is the best day to go there. It's a take out store only."}
{"text":"The food is okay - I've been there twice and each time the items I bought were somewhat damp i.e. missing the normal crunch. The place kind of smells and the staff does not inspire a lot of confidence in terms of cleanliness. I wasn't brave enough to try any \"sweets\" - only the fried stuff. I wish there were more shops in Montreal that sell Indian sweets/munchies."}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked away from all the noises of this wonderful city! I first discovered this place while driving around and getting lost. I stopped at a building, went inside to see if i could ask for some directions and was hit with the wonderful scent of indian spices. I was drawn to it! 

So it's a room with two fridge counters and some unfolded plastic tables with all sorts of indian sweets and some savoury items. But let me tell you about their samosas. Oh my God they are to die for! The best i've ever eaten in my life! I love samosas and everywhere that i would find some, i would try. This place is the best! Filled with potatoes, peas, onions and spices, it is the perfect combination of salt and spice. The dough is thin and oh my so flaky. Soooooo good!!! Call in advance to see if they have samosas because it sells very quickly:)"}
