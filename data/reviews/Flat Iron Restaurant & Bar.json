{"text":"Great Food, Fantastic Decor,  TERRIBLE Service.

And I mean BAD. We had a party of 12 visiting for a birthday dinner. I was told by several people the food was great and I found the prices to be very decent!  

Since we had a large order with 12 people we expected our order take significantly longer. However, I noticed they never once came around for refills, and we were without drinks for a full hour waiting for our meal. 

After eating they never actually cleared our plates from our table! While we chatted and enjoyed the birthday celebrations we had to move all our plates to one side.

Furthermore, our two waitresses never came back with the bill. After waiting for a long while I finally got up and walked around and found her and then requested we get our bills.  

She got the bills for half our table, and said the other waitress was in charge of the other half of the table and we would have to wait for her. 45 minutes later we told them if they didnt get the rest of the bills for us now we would simply leave without paying. Finally, the bills came and we could leave.

The most infuriating part was FIVE waitresses all drinking and chatting at the bar, and we were the only people there! So why was this so difficult?

It's very unfortunate considering how good the food is. But it would appear that they have lost our entire party as future customers."}
{"text":"This place tries to be evening chic while located in the industrial suburbs near the airport. With trendy furniture and cutlery, hot waitresses and euro-techno music, it would not be out of place on the streets of Zagreb.

That means a chilly place by Calgary standards. Everything seemed industrial and superficial, from the friendly waitress to the menu to the food. Things tasted good, but apart from the daily specials, I had the distinct impression that all the food was manufactured on the other side of the world and reheated out of plastic containers.

So, go for the special!

We didn't linger, though the bar side might have been cozier and more inviting than the restaurant side. A bit pricey for the package they deliver."}
{"text":"The food was really good it took a really long time to get though. The service not so much. I would come here again despite the not so good service."}
{"text":"Stay away from the New York Steak and go with the flat iron. The lettuce wraps and the french onion soup were very salty. Not sure if I could recommend this place but they did take the bad food off the bill. Some of the other food was good such a the garlic bread.... And the pasta but they definitely need to improve the food. Service was great at atmosphere is nice but their chairs and table settle were annoying."}
{"text":"I'm a polite guy, and I love restaurants. Not this one. 

We tried twice when it first opened, they failed miserably but we gave them a third chance after it had been open a while.

As is tradition, the maitre'd / host came by the table of five of us and introduced himself as the owner and asked how our meal was. I thought \"what a great time to let the management know we love the idea of a competitor to Joeys and Earls in the area, so let's get it right\". I asked the table who enjoyed their meal and the voices were unanimous that everyone was extremely disappointed in their dishes and the service.

The owner's response was to walk away and never return. Not a word, not a comment, not an acknowledgement of the three times we had terrible experiences.

No TIP was left by the way, and that is an absolute never do in my books.

That beings us to the fourth time I went as of today because of a business meeting. 

THE FOOD IS NOT EDIBLE. WoW, they must have the worst executive chef in the business.

Nuff said, too bad because it looks great in there."}
{"text":"It's not that special. We only checked out this place because we had a groupon. 

Ok. So the decor is very unique. You come in and you eyes are blazened with RED light from the hostess table to the bar. Neat concept but kind of offensive on the eyes if you aren't prepared. Sadly, you're paying a pretty penny for the decor and cute waitresses than you are on quality unique food. 

We started off with the asiago and roasted mushroom balls. They were decent but gross that they felt heavy and fattening but $12?? 

My boyfriend had the Chicken, Brie and Strawberry Sandwich and I had the California Chicken Quesadilla. Again... nothing special. The side salad I got was pretty good though. It's the \"Essential Greens\" with lettuce, cranberry, pumpkin seeds, and feta with lemon dijon. Very yummy for a side salad. Kinda wish I just had gotten the entree sized salad. 

In a nutshell. Come once for the decor and beyond that spend your money on somewhere that makes good food."}
{"text":"Went there on 3/10/13 and the restaurant was closed due to some financial issue.  The website it still up but the restaurant is closed."}
{"text":"Last night i made an impromptu dinner date at The Flat Iron. WHY did no one tell me how amazing of a place this is?!?!? I officially LOVE it.

My date and I ordered two appetizers (don't judge). First up was the Asiago & Roasted Mushroom Balls ($12.55) and next up was the Rasted Vegetable Hummus ($9.25). They were both FANTASTIC.

For dinner I ordered the Thai Vegetable & Rice Noodles ($13.25) and my date got the FlatIron Steak Sandwich($14.95). One Word: DELISH.

The atmosphere was amazing. If I had to describe it, it would be a first-class, much fancier version of Earls. But when it comes to the food, surroundings and service, Earls pales in comparison to the Flat Iron.

The Flat Iron carries all different types of fare: Asian, Middle-Eastern, American, you name it. All their food is prepared professionally and their service is some of the best I've experienced since being back in town.

The Flat Iron gets 5 flamin' hot stars from this Yelper, and hey, as more and more of you go, their 5 star count has no where else to go but up."}
{"text":"Attended a lunch meeting today at Flat Iron. The restaurant styling is very nice. Great atmosphere to meet for business.

The service started great, however, I found it slowed down as the restaurant filled up with more people (maybe 30% full and nothing to consider an impact to service in a lunch rush). 

The mushroom cheddar burger with green salad was a great choice. The salad was an excellent mix for a green salad. The nice touch was some dried cranberries added on top. The burger was also very good. It wasn't the best burger I have eaten but the spice blend added to the burger patty gave it a nice flavor.

Overall I would say it was a good experience for a quick lunch in a great setting for a business casual meal."}
{"text":"Just home from dinner with my \"dress club\" - 12 of us that meet on the first Wednesday of every month.  Each person takes a turn picking a place.  Tonite the pick was Flat Iron,  

Not sure how it is that I have never been to this place, but I know that I will be a regular.

Great place to have a quiet dinner for 2, or enjoy a nite out with a group.  Tables can be arranged to accomodate group of your choice.

Staff is amazing...  from the moment I entered the restaurant, there was a welcoming atmosphere.  The staff actually seemed to enjoy their jobs, and were hospitable, and courteous and fun.  Everyone in the group commented on how great the service was.

Meals looked amazing... from appetizers to entree's - there is a list of food that I would like to try in the future. My choice for tonite was a bowl of soup, and then a dessert.  Roasted Garlic & Potato soup... all I can say is #yum!!  I'm usually the only person in the group that orders dessert, and it's always the menu I check first.  I decided to try the Lemon Cheesecake.  Layer of Shortbread, covered with Lemon Sauce, and a layer of Toasted Marshmallow - wow - loved it!

There was not one thing about this place that I didn't like...  decor was inviting, heard the washrooms were gorgeous (have to check that next time), chairs were so comfortable, service was superb and food was beyond tastey.  

Definitely a new favorite - and I will be back...  I have clients in the area, and think that will be a great place to enjoy some Christmas lunches!!"}
{"text":"I have visited Flat Iron on four separate occasions since it opened. The place has a great decor, something I am not usually impressed with or care to notice, but it really does provide a great ambiance for intimate gatherings, romantic dates, or when you just have to be a good offspring and take your mother out for lunch/dinner.

They have an interesting drink menu, offering in house made beer and candy-infused vodka. They also have a wine menu, but the cellar is oddly located right beside the washroom.

In my first three visits, I have been quite pleased with their signature dishes. Their fondue appetizer was delicious and a consistent must-order. I also liked their slow-braised bison served on polenta, a refreshing contrast compared to other places that serve bison as a ground patty.

However the last visit served to be disappointing.

They no longer had the bison signature dish. So I took a chance on their daily special which turned out into a disappointing Asian-fusion concoction of shrimp, chicken, veggies, and rice noodle with an imposing sweet, sour, and spicy sauce. It was hard to enjoy and I was relieved when someone in our table couldn't finish their steak. The steak was surprisingly good, it tasted like it was properly aged and cooked to the right degree. Now its understandable if they didn't have the bison on their menu anymore, perhaps it just wasn't a popular dish. But I was even more disappointed with their fondue. For almost 20 dollars, they really cut back on the ingredients. The cheese/dip level was very low that you can to scrape the bread across it in order to get enough sauce. They only gave us bread, salami, and apples for dipping, when years ago, there was a lot more ingredients provided. 

3 out of 4 isn't too bad. But for the price Flat Iron is charging, the consistency should be above 75%. Their service has been great, but even in this last visit the crew was very limited so our orders took quite a while, a major drawback caused by Flat Iron's decision to remain open during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"Flat iron steak was wonderful, French fries soggy, oily, should have gone with the mashed 

Shrimp in phylo was yummy"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, about what you expect for this price range.  The decor was good, but our table was a bit dark and we couldn't really make out what we were eating exactly.  They should really turn up their lights when it is dark outside."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy food, great atmosphere and wonderful service.  I've been here twice, and both times everyone has enjoyed their food and enjoyed the staff.  There's a huge menu and wide selection of options, with something for everyone."}
{"text":"Flat Iron...  If I'd be asked to choose just one restaurant in Calgary, it would be a highly probable candidate. Oh yes.

Location of the place is a negative, but not restrictive. NE, Barlow trail... If you are staying in the hotel around the airport zone, good for you. Or if you drive from out of the city - not a big deal. But otherwise - inaccessible.

Flat Iron is expensive, and that's the money well spent. If you are on a business trip solo, that may be your place, as it was mine. Drop in, choose a spot you like, get a glass of wine, relax, think about your stuff... They know how to keep the atmosphere warm and comfortable.

Staff is very friendly, and service ranges from good to terrific. In one occasion the manager was specifically asking me about their new addition to the menu, and I was obviously happy to share my thoughts. They also noticed the place I preferred, and were doing their best to seat me there each time I was dropping in, unless it was taken.

The only other negative is the size of the menu. I run out of options after about ten visits, and that's not much. I would love to see more plates and wines to choose from. But otherwise, like I said, Flat Iron is one of the finest in Calgary."}
{"text":"I've been to Flat Iron a few different times under all sorts of different circumstances. The atmosphere makes it a reasonably swanky place to bring a date or have a lunch meeting. It's sort of like a slightly cooler Earl's. Hipster Earl's. Earls for people who are too cool to eat at Earl's. 

The price point is similar to an Earl's. In fact, it's almost like someone said, \"Let's take everything Earl's does, make it a little more hip and call it Flat Iron\" - and a joyous cheer rang out.

Most recently I came by here before heading to the Opera with a cultured young lady. We were dressed to the nines. 

So what do two incredibly good looking people eat when dressed to the nines? Deep fried pickles. To their credit, Flat Iron has my favorite deep fried pickles in the city because they're served really hot with a chipotle sort of dip of some kind. Hot, spicy, deep fried and delicious. The pickles were the reason we were there.

That said, you feel a little like you just stepped into some sort of cult when you go to Flat Iron. The bar glows red. A huge fireplace roars off to the side. Waitresses in their usual \"black and tight\" dress code do their best to smile at you like you're the best looking man that's walked in there that day. (While some might think this disingenuous/manipulative, I choose to believe I actually WAS the best looking man who walked in there that day. I was, after all, in a suit.) But by any stretch you sort of feel like Mugatu from Zoolander is about to bust out of the back, strap some sort of hypno-headphones to your head and initiate you into a snooty, martini drinking cult where everyone stares blankly ahead and gets together on weekends to watch seasons of Jersey Shore.

I hope that made sense. I doubt it, but it's 6:30 in the morning right now and I'm strung out on Vanilla Lattes. 

This time I ordered a chicken sandwich of some kind. The sandwich was good - average more or less (not quite as amazing as the one you can scoop up at Kensington Pub, but FAR better than the salty monstrosity you're served up at Moxie's). For the price I paid I honestly expected a little more oomph, but it was passable.

But the sandwich was not the star of the show - and neither were the deep fried pickles (surprisingly). In fact, what stole the show was the ASTRONOMICALLY HUGE salad they served me as a \"side\". 

If you are hungry, don't order fries with your meal. Order a salad. I have yet to come across anywhere else in the city where a \"side\" salad could easily constitute your entire meal. In case I am not articulating well, this thing was massive. 

I asked the waitress if anyone had EVER finished their entire meal and their salad in one sitting and she said \"Yes\" like it wasn't a feat equivalent to scaling Everest. I'm a reasonably big dude at 5'11 and 180, and this salad kicked my ass.

So, big points for not skimping on the sides, Flat Iron. 

My Opera-accompaniment had the Tiger Bowl. It smelled delicious and was big enough that she didn't finish it. Reviews seemed positive, but I didn't try it on account of the giant salad I was trying desperately to make a dent in.

I like their beers - Angry Bald Man Ale is a gooder. Their burgers are also pretty huge, so you won't go hungry.

Our server was also very pleasant and took notice of our suave apparel. She was quick on the draw and unlike many waitresses in this city, actually did her job. 

I'd love to give Flat Iron a 3.5. It's not bad - sometimes it's great but it's not quite anything special. My experiences here have just been too varied to say they're consistently great, but another visit like this one and I'd be well inclined to up their score. You're moving in the right direction, Flat Iron. Don't let me down!"}
{"text":"Flat Iron Restaurant & Bar is located on 27th Avenue NE of Calgary, kind of hidden if you're driving in the dark but its right besides HOOTERS where thats hard to miss.  If you're unsure, just look for the HOOTERS and Flat Iron is nearby!

Entering Flat Iron you get a romantic feel, with the dim lights and the bright red host table up front.  We went on a Saturday around 5:30PM and it wasn't busy at all.  We were a party of 8 but we paid in 3 separate bills.

Spence and I ate prior coming to Flat Iron, so we decided to get an appy to share and a dessert each.  We ordered the Prawn Cigarillos which is Black tiger prawns wrapped in crispy spring roll paper with ponzu sauce for dipping..they were plain but good, the dipping sauce has a little kick to it and it comes in an order of 5 spring rolls.

For dessert, I got the \"Fresh\" Cake Doughnut Holes which is 7 warm cinnamon sugar doughnut holes drizzled with creamy caramel and served with a scoop of caramel ice cream.  I found the doughnuts to be a little hard, didn't seem 'fresh' at all but it was OK, I wouldn't get it again.  Spence ordered the Molten Brownie chocolate walnut brownie, which was warm dark chocolate ganache and vanilla gelato.   I tried some and I thought it was better than my dessert.  Spence said the brownie at Boston's Pizza is WAY better.  But the service was great.  Topping water and being very attentive.

Everyone else ordered drinks, appys and actual meals.  Everyone seemed to enjoy everything.  That is until the bill came.  Like I said before, we were a party of 8 but got the bill separated into 3 bills.  Spence and I recieved our bill which was $29.37 which we thought was ok.  Then a few minutes later, our server comes back and tell us that this is our 'actual' bill ...same bill but with 18% gratuity charge added on so it came out to be $34.40.  We weren't SO happy about the gratuity charge because it was unexpected and we weren't told from the beginning there was an 18% grat charge for parties of 8 or more.  Each of us got a 18% grat added on, and the other two parties weren't too happy.  The manager got involved etc etc but Spence and I didn't want to fuzz., we were going to give her about $5 anyway for a tip.

The manager was apologetic and offered to take the grat off (but we just paid).  He also did mention that it was a new company policy that just came into effect about 2 weeks ago but it would have been nice to be informed at the beginning.

I don't agree with the automatic gratuity on larger parties only because what happens if the service was absolutley awful, but I do understand.  If we were told about the gratuity at the beginning, it would have been a different story."}
{"text":"I went to Flat Iron because I liked the look of their menu online and I had a daily deal for $50.  I brought along 2 of my girls for a Friday night dinner of appetizers.  

When you walk into Flat Iron, you kind of feel like you're walking into a nuclear reactor in meltdown mode.  This is because everything glows with a lovely red hue.  The place wasn't busy at all and despite certain death we were shown to a beat up table next to the bathroom.  Lovely.  I don't know about you, but if it was my last meal on earth, I'd  like to sit as far away from the bathroom as possible.

We moved to a non-bathroom table and were greeted promptly by a friendly server who quickly brought us a round of waters as we wanted to experience the apocalypse without mind altering beverages.

We shared three appies - deep fried pickles, calamari, and lettuce wraps.  The pickles are exactly the same as those at the Ship and arrive with a fantastic dip.  The calamari was ok, could have been seasoned a bit better, and the tzatziki was a miss, more pickle dip would do well here.  The lettuce wraps were uber salty.  If the nuclear meltdown doesn't kill you, the sodium in these bad boys will.  These were accompanied by a sneaky upsell by our server \"Would you like chicken or shrimp?\" (We didn't know that a few pieces of chicken were an extra $4.50, but who trifles with such matters when the world is ending?)

Finally, we shared the molten chocolate dessert.  A great way to finish an ok meal, but to be fair, it's really just a warm brownie with ice cream.  If it says molten, I want to tempt fate by burning my mouth on some melty chocolate dammit.

Overall, we got out of there alive, though it was close at times.  Ultimately, we agreed that the dim lighting makes the furnishings look better than they are.  Unfortunately, since we weren't drinking, we didn't feel the same about the food or the ambiance."}
{"text":"This is the absolute soonest I've ever written a review since going to a place...Rob & I went here for lunch today. When we first walked in, the receptionist was very friendly and acknowledged us with a smile and sat us in a very trendy, lofty area. The waitress who showed up after that was very sociable with a great sense of humor, and when we ordered our appetizer it was brought to us within 10-15 minutes, so that was fast service. The meals we ordered looked small on the big plates (Rob had a steak dinner and I got the chicken quesadilla), but they were still very filling. It seemed every possible need was met, and the napkins were even big & absorbent (I like that).
Another interesting thing about Flat Iron Restaurant & Bar, is that they have very unqiue-to-them food & drinks you won't find anywhere else, i.e. the \"Big Kid's\" Root Beer Float (contains alcohol). Check them out for more..."}
{"text":"Great food- had the pot stickers and tuna salad
hot waitstaff = enjoyable dining"}
{"text":"I think this location is getting a raw deal. I work very close to Flat Iron and eat there 2-5 times per month (depending on if I have groceries for lunch or not), and I have had a great experience EVERY time. I guess it's good that it's not overly busy as I always get a seat quickly which is important on a one hour lunch break, but I feel bad it's not busier. The location only opened about 1.5-2 years ago and has a really nice décor with a modern/comfortable feel to it. The giant 6-8 foot wall fireplace is pretty cool to sit next to (especially in winter) if you're cold from the travels. The wine cellar display is also a very nice touch to whoever decorated the joint. During the summer, they have an outside patio which makes for a nice lunch hour tanning session while getting some eats.

Service has been great every time I have been there rating a 4/5 to 5/5 on each visit - which I appreciate as I am a fan of consistency. The servers are always friendly, happy, helpful and attentive to the table. The shining star of the restaurant in my opinion is definitely their menu and the food (which you would hope after all in a restaurant). I think I have eaten almost everything on the menu and many items too many times (think mushroom asiago risotto balls). Seriously, everything is good and I don't know that I (or any of my colleagues) could name a bad meal had there in 2 years.  The appetizers are extremely tasty and well created, the burgers are massive and to die for, the pastas are some of the best outside of Italian restaurants (and better than some of those even) and their salads are really, really good (I know, who reviews a salad). I'd like to give a  huge shout out to their chef(s) as they have created a really good menu. I really don't know why it's usually a bit slow there during lunch hour. Maybe it's because Joey's is close by and has ruled the market in my area for forever or maybe it's because Hooters is its closest neighbor - which is bad publicity.

Favorite things: The Summer Fling Salad is my favorite salad in Calgary, The Davinci pasta is very tasty, the quesadilla is a great grab for lunch and for you burger mongers - do it, it's worth the red meat intake. As previously noted, the asiago risotto balls (on the appy side) make me a better person.
Please stop by and try out this awesome restaurant for the really great food, good service and please help keep my lunch time hang out alive."}
{"text":"Very modern, very upscale.  I felt a little under-dressed (probably why they sat me in the bar).  Food was delicious.  Had the Asian ribs for an appetizer (very tender).  This was followed by the Flat Iron steak sandwich.  The meat was very tender, perfect for a sandwich.  The baked Gala apple for dessert was tasty.  Their house beer \"Bald Man\" was not bad.  The other house beer (forgot the name) tasted a like Bud Light to me.  Prices were high, to be expected walking in the place.  I got the appetizer for free with my hotel room key and still ended up spend $50 by myself.  Half of that was for the 3 beers I drank.  If you are looking for an upscale dining experience this is a great place to try."}
