{"text":"Well this place is great. Fish and chips are always fresh and crispy. Chose cod or halibut ,,, either is good. They also have the most amazing burgers!  The waffle burger is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Our order was upgraded by the owner because we had to wait a while for our order, we definitely did not mind the wait! The food was soooooooo good and the owner and his wife were so friendly! will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Overhyped overpriced take my word you can't have teenagers running a business when you walk in they tell you you will get three dollars off if you follow them on Instagram we went there burgers were undercooked fries were mediocre the  place had no heat had to wear my jacket to eat the music was on so loud felt like it was a nightclub I just learned my experience that you can't get fooled by the media of places where to go eat if you want to burger stick to the original places that make simple plain burgers and homemade fries."}
{"text":"What a burger, onions ring amazing, fresh made food every single time, a throw back to the days of fresh meat burger joints.  A+++++"}
{"text":"This is simply the best burger joint you'll find. Try the Reuben sandwich too or try a Nutjob which is basically a Reuben on top of a massive double burger. EPIC!!!"}
{"text":"Due to a dedication to cooking in only the healthiest of oils and unique flavors, this place is mine and my boyfriend's favorite place to grab a burger. I like to refer to it a a \"clean cheat\" day when looking for comfort food.   Prices are fair considering the quality of the beef and the premium toppings, buns and beverages available for an unprecedented experience whilst eating a burger."}
{"text":"Would never go back ! Disgusting greasy food. Oil was so old my onion rings were black."}
{"text":"Gets a \"1\" because there's no \"0\". Disgusting and filthy dirty!  The owner is high on himself and very rude to people who don't fall for his bullshit.  No one wants to hear your rehearsed bs about how your food is healthy, blah, blah, blah!! I'm sure it's super healthy with all the grease and dirt and all!!!!The washrooms are absolutely disgusting which makes me wonder how clean the people making the food are and how hygienic their food preparation skills are. The build up of grease on the grill is enough to make anyone's stomach turn.  They smoke either in the back room or with the back door open so the whole place stinks of smoke. The service was horrible, the place was filthy and the owner is arrogant.  The place was practically empty and it took over 20 mins for them to begin our order!  Nothing more than a place for the high school kids to hang out and get off school grounds, although I'm sure the cafeteria food is cleaner and better than this place!  Definitely much \"healthier\" than the food served in this place."}
{"text":"This place is too salty for me. Had it 3 times and even asked for no seasoning on the patty, because I saw them putting additional seasoning while it is being cooked on the grill from my previous visit.  Still salty and their fries are over seasoned as well.  But you may like it if you don't find McDonald's fries not salty. Because I do."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a long time since I follow them on Instagram and drool over all the posts.  Delicious burger, fantastic onion rings.  Fish was excellent only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because the fries were really salty.  They are seasoned with chunky sea salt which was a bit too salty for us. The owner is super nice, the place super clean and decor is trendy.  We can't wait to go again. I really want to change my rating to 5 stars. Burger in my opinion (and my family)  is that it's way better then the burger priest.  This is my sons new favourite spot."}
{"text":"So I've been following this place on Instagram for months now and have been meaning to check it out.  Every time they post a picture my mouth waters.  Well finally I had a chance to visit them.  Let me tell you it was well worth the wait.  The owners are super friendly and even told me how to save money using Instagram.  Great for business.  I know they are known for their fish and chips but all the hype about there burgers was killing me.  Of course I ordered the burger.  It was very juicy tasty and huge.  Cooked perfectly on the grill NOT the flattop.  If you haven't been there yet I suggest you go but please go hungry"}
{"text":"The fish and chips are awful and so overpriced. It was all batter, no fish. I wouldn't return again. Nothing special about this place whatsoever."}
{"text":"The place is in the middle of renos and rebranding so I won't speak to the decor.  The owner was a very nice guy and ran us through the entire menu. Most of our group got halibut fish and chips while one of us got a AAA burger. Spread of fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings.  The food took about as much time as you'd expect with only the owner working.  Presentation was on a wooden board and other costal-themed fish stuff. Nice.  Portions were pleasent, especially the burger. Sides were well executed. Fish could have used a little seasoning but The fish to breading ratio was excellent. The burger was top-class especially with the reuben-style smoked meat on top.  As we were the only ones in there, the owner was nice enough to have some conversation with us.  I plan on going back when the renos are done."}
{"text":"Went here and the food was ok. Not great. We paid 85 for 4 burgers with combos. Two of the burgers were 8 oz and two were four oz. sides with the combos were onion rings (did not taste like good onions, were flavourless) two sides were poutine. Not worth the money and the place could really truly use a good clean everywhere."}
{"text":"Something weird about this place. Their hours of operation on google say 4-8PM on Sunday  I told my buddy at noon on sunday that we would go for lunch. Then he told me theyre not even open for lunch. I was like \"Wow impossible.\" I check online, on google it clearly says sunday 4-8.   So instead we went to stupid burger.   I tried Calling ahead of time, no voicemail stating the hours. Phone just kept ringing.   Guess I'll never try it."}
{"text":"I seen the hype of this place in social media and I persuade my boyfriend to come here, so happy I did. Amazing service and portions were MASSIVE I had to take my left overs to go. This place will not disappoint you at all!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places I've been to in the GTA. Service was great, and the menu has a variety of options for everyone's needs. I ordered an 6oz burger with fries (can't remember which kind exactly) but it exceeded expectations and was worth the cost of, which is always important. A good local spot for burger lovers in the Woodbridge neighbourhood. They also are active on social media and give out special discounts to those who are following their accounts, a strategy I feel that would benefit many businesses yet not many have taken that route just yet."}
{"text":"To say this visit was a disappointment would be an understatement, especially considering the rave reviews we've read about this place. When we arrived we went directly to the counter and asked if they did Halibut and Chips. They did, but it isn't advertised on the menu. We placed our order....and were told it would be 20 minutes.   We sat on a wooden bench that was rock hard....they had some cushions on it, but they were screwed to the bench, so if you sat in an area that didn't have one, you were SOL. We moved over so we could sit on a cushion, but they are so thin that they really didn't provide much relief.  The place itself is oddly decorated. There are teal Christmas decorations still hanging from the ceiling, a yellow stuffed bird hanging from a light fixture, the menu (posted on the wall) have those cheap IKEA kids circus canopies over top of them.   When the food arrived in about 15 minutes...there were a few issues with it: 1) the fries were burnt......and weren't cooked all the way through. This means the grease was too hot...so the outside of the fries were burnt (and had a burnt flavour to them), and the insides were still crunchy. We did not eat them all and ended up throwing half of them away. They had a nice seasoning on them, but the burnt taste and being uncooked completely destroyed any attempts of salvation.  2) the fish was cooked properly, but it was a small portion. When I went up to pay, I was told by the gentleman at the cash that he wasn't going to charge me the full price, as they had run out of halibut and that they couldn't give us a full order each. I was charged $14.99 instead of the regular $17.95.   3) the checkered paper that they place their orders on are not waxed....so when you add malt vinegar, it becomes soggy and falls apart. I had several bites of fish that had this cheap paper stuck to it.  4) the coleslaw was ok...nothing to knock your socks off.  5) 2 orders of halibut and chips, 1 Brio and 1 pop, even with the discount...came to just under $34.  The two male teens working were excellent. They were efficient...they cooked, worked cash, changed garbage bags, etc.   Based on food quality alone, I won't go back....."}
{"text":"Food: Burger was ok. Meat to bun ratio wasn't great.  Fries were soggy, soaked with oil.   Service: Not bad. The owner asked how I found them, I told them yelp, they gave me a discount."}
{"text":"Good Friday was ruined. Tasteless, expensive and disgusting. Fish and chips will never be purchased from here again. Id rather go back to my usual north York spot than give my business to thieves of quality!"}
{"text":"Great food & service!!!  Came here for a well deserved cheat-meal and was not disappointed!   Had a AAA 6oz. which was great, the fries were amazing, and onion ring also very good (I'm usually not a fan of onion rings). My friend got the \"all day-breaky\" and I tried a piece...luv at first bite! Will return for the breaky for sure!"}
