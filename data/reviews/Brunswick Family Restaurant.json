{"text":"Service is good for a mom and pop restaurant. Breakfast is good for the price. I don't recommend any of the lunch/dinner options."}
{"text":"Cheap but lousy breakfast food. Service took forever even with only a few people in there. I'll pass on this place from now on!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food,  friendly service. I felt my self like home . Kids friendly. Great for breakfast , lunch and dinners. Also they are having a car show , which is entertaining event for your lunch time on Saturday."}
{"text":"They have a fantastic breakfast sandwich, the only thing I would change is that it seems like the bagels are not consistent.  One of the best breakfast sandwiches in Brunswick."}
{"text":"The place is nothing to look at inside or out, but breakfast was great and a good deal. I got the biscuits 'n gravy with a side of eggs for just $4.99, it was a good size and really tasty."}
