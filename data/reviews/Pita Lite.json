{"text":"Ordered desert from the menu and i was told that its not available, owner insisted that i have to pick meat items only. Why put items on menu if they can't be ordered?  Food is overpriced compared to other shawarma places, and you get a feeling that this place can cheap out on a lot of things..."}
{"text":"Just what everyone else is saying, horrible customer service and just average food.  Taste was nothing spectacular.  And for them to run a 50% off deal with groupon, means they're dying for business.  Or, people just don't come back for a second time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to give it a try and I'm glad I did! This place is great! I got a chicken shawarma with a few pieces of falafel on the side. Everything was fresh and very tasty, pricing is great too!"}
{"text":"where do I start? the restaurant it self is clean and a place where you can eat comfortably, next the service was on point, they knew what they were doing and was friendly! I ordered the chicken wrap and it was perfect; with no flaws! the hot sauce brings the flavour of everything out more! All in all I would definitely recommend this place to any one!"}

{"text":"Fresh food. The chicken souvlaki wrap is great!. Very nice and friendly staff. I am a regular now."}
{"text":"The food is good.  But the service is terrible.  My mother and I went up to order and we're asked rudely what we wanted.  When we asked for the chicken soulvaki she told us there was only 1 so we'd have to wait.  Then she ordered my mother to sit down and walked away to the back for at least 5 minutes.  I then decided my mother could have the soulvaki and I would have a shawarma.  During this process this lady yelled at her fellow colleague in front of all the customers.  She was so Rude the entire time we were there.  Once we got to the end they informed us they didn't have credit there,  so my mother ran back to the hotel to grab her debit.  They were so unorganized.  I felt bad for the man the lady yelled at as he seemed to be trying really hard to do what the others obviously cared little about.  When we got back to the hotel they gave my mother a shawarma not the soulvaki.  Although the food is good and I'd buy it again,  I will never return here.  Ever."}
{"text":"The worst service of any restaurant I've been to.  I walk in and the employee is on his phone laughing and texting; he tells me to wait a minute (so he can finish his funny text I assume). I order a meal and he tells me it will be 6-7 minutes. I order the meal and tell him I will wait outside until it's ready. I return 5 minutes later and he hasn't even started yet. In fact he is still texting and chatting with a woman who may or may not be an employee.  He told me he would start cooking the meal now. Seriously, I'm supposed to wait another 7 minutes because he had to finish texting?   This place has lost me and everyone I know as a customer. The epitome of unprofessionality."}
{"text":"Super bland, just skip it and go to the other middle eastern place across the street or McDonald if you're hungry late at night."}
{"text":"I came here to try some of there shawarma, but then I  saw they had a Lafa spoon i had to try it. The vegetables are very fresh and sauces taste soo great. The Lafa is bigger then the traditional pita. Their shawarma meat was the star of my day soo flavorful. The store is much more modern looking  than the other shawarma stores.   :)"}
{"text":"I  found  the best Mediterranean taste in this restaurant. The kabobs are exquisite and the shawarmas  are made fresh, hot and ready to serve. I never leave the restaurant with an empty stomach. Definitely a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. I tried the falafel wrap and it tasted very fresh. They have a good topping selection and the falafel pieces taste great. Their hot sauce and other sauce selection is good too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. No complaints here. Met all my expectations really well."}
{"text":"The good thing about this place it's open until 12 unlike other places around here. Anyway I'm not a shawarma lover, so every time I stay too late at  my gym I just grab a Steak Wrap the one they have on promotion now and it's absolutely adorable with all the grilled vegetables and stuff. The food is always fresh and  the guys are giving a good service, so Pita deserves 5 stars from me"}
{"text":"The food was very good, fresh, and reasonably priced. The falafels were not pre-made which made for delicious, freshly fried falafel that was not too dry like most places I have visited in the past. The restaurant was VERY clean. I ordered the falafel plate and it comes with rice, potato, and a salad. All were very good. The portion was huge! I could have definitely divided it into two meals. I purchased a beverage and it totaled to under $11."}
{"text":"Food is average But the Service is Poor. Would rather go to Shawarma Max right across.   I ordered 1) Shawarma Platter, 2) Chicken  Shawarma Salad and 3) Falafel Salad.   Service too slow.      Only one person working.  Guy working there started giving food to people coming after me who had single orders.  Rude.    When he finally started cooking my order. He was preparing only 2 Salads. I thought he might have forgot about the third. I inquired and the guy rudely replied that if I had 2 salads or not. and When I repeated about Shawarma. He didn't cared to reply and just carried on.  Food is average. Good for take out not so much for sit in."}
{"text":"This is by far my fave shawarma place - very clean, affordable, neat. The staff is SUPER nice and welcoming. You can tell them exactly what you want and it always turns out delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped here to grab a chicken shawarma wrap for lunch.   They have a great selection of toppings and they all looked and tasted very fresh. The garlic sauce and hot sauce (ask for extra because they go pretty light on application of the hot sauce) were really flavourful. The chicken had the nice crispy edges, but was still very juicy and flavourful.   It's good to have another shawarma option on top of my usual go-to (Osmow's)."}
{"text":"Very clean place. I was served by an old lady. She is so friendly and generous. My plate was full with sufficient amount of food. I even had a left over that I ate it the other day. The food was tasty 8.5/10. Salad and veg were fresh. Price wise very good with the amount u get. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After a long day of sight seeing, we wanted something quick to eat.  We chose Pita Lite out of a group of take-out restaurants.  The 2 guys working the counter were a little terse in the beginning, but once we decided on our ordered, they were very patient and accommodating.  One of the guys made recommendations on which sauces I should get.  I appreciated his recommendations.    I ordered the falafel platter.  The falafel was extremely dense.  I was only able to eat 1.  The salad, tabouleh, & turmeric rice were satisfying.  The meal served its purpose.  My son ordered the beef shwarma.  He said the beef made him feel nauseous.  He didn't eat it all.  He barely touched the rest of the platter.    The tabouleh salad was fresh, but dry."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of shawarma's and one for lunch whenever I get a chance. And this place is up there with the best."}
{"text":"Fukken best place ever! I was obsessed with osmows but this place blows them out! Chicken5/5 has so much flavour rice isn't oily and has 5/5 flavour. The wrap gets grilled which gives it the same taste as osmows but the ingredients is what gives this place a different feel. Over all 5/5 for food and experience"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Decided to give this place a try and got a chicken shawarma wrap.   Chicken pieces were moist and the hot sauce was good. Would have preferred the chicken pieces to be a bit more crispy on the edges for added texture and flavour.   The veggies tasted fresh but the turnip and cucumber could have been sliced thinner for a better texture instead of having to bite off huge chunks of it.   This place makes a good option for a quick work lunch. They also do lunch catering and delivery."}
{"text":"I drove around for a bit looking for this place but I should have kept driving! I ordered a chicken shawarma and it's probably the worst one I've ever had. The chicken lacked flavour and the toppings were mundane. I've paid $4.00 for a chicken shawarma sandwich that would blow this one out of the water. If you're looking for a mouthwateringly delicious shawarma sandwich this is not the place."}
{"text":"I had a laffa bread chicken shawarma wrap, it was soooo good! Honestly, I've eaten a bunch of shawarma in my life, and this was the best one I've had! I'm white bread, so I can't talk for authenticity.. But it was very flavourful. I would've liked a bit more spiciness, but yeah, I think they didn't put as much thinking I couldn't handle it LOL! The vegetables were all fresh, and crunchy, definitely try it!! It was inexpensive, and fast.. I will be back to try their felafel!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place which is worthy of at least a 3.5. I was thinking about giving a 4, but I always often find the room temperature uncomfortable here and I feel they overcharge for the laffa - which is simply from a package and not traditionally made to justify the extra $1.50 IMO.  Apart from that, no complaints. The meat is flavourful and they do just about everything else right."}
{"text":"This is a typical pita/shawarma place that serves pita sandwiches and also plates. The key difference is that they also sell kebob dishes. The pictures suggest that the kebob dishes are Iranian style. Koobideh and Chicken kebobs are available. This place's pricing strategy really pushes you to get the specials. I didn't get the specials the 2 times I've been here but maybe I should have, because the things I got were not very good. There are several strikes against.  For my first meal here I decided to get a large falafel plate. Relative to other places, I find the falafel here a little hard on the outside and dry on the inside. Portion wise, it's ok for the price you pay. The falafel was subpar but I really liked the salad.   For my second meal, I got the beef kebob (2 x ground beef, or koobideh). Once again this is subpar. There are several Iranian places if you go north. All of those places are superior to this, and cheaper. Pita Lite charges $7.99 for a koobideh. Mine didn't come with a tomato/veggies at all as per the picture. There's also no yellow rice. The skewers were adequate and what I expected them to taste like. But every other place sells koobideh for cheaper and they come with salad or pop. So clearly the value is lacking. Oh and they didn't give any sumac or butter. It's literally a box of white rice + kebobs.   So basically I don't like their falafel and there are much better choices for Iranian kebobs dishes. Despite the poor rating, I haven't ruled them out yet. It might have been unwise of me to not get their specials. Their specials are their bread and butter and will probably be very decent. Chicken shawarma plate for $5.99? That's what I'm getting next time. Maybe they should just remove all the kebob dishes from the menu because they seem very pricey and subpar if my meal was any indication.  ****Update****  I've tried their chicken shawarma plate special for $5.99. It's worth it. You get a box  full of rice and shawarma and they give you 3 sauces. Very good price-value ratio. The chicken shawarma is also cooked to the right texture. So don't bother with their other stuff and just get their shawarma."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for pita lite, it's literally a few mins walk from my office.   Walked in today to be half greeted by a young girl, not over friendly and I took a few mins to glance over the menu board while she was serving other customers.  When it was my turn I told her I have a groupon, right away she aggressively told me I couldn't have any specials.  I said ok it's my first time here I'll have a chicken shawarma. She said You can't have it at as the special shawarma only a regular (whatever that means, first time here lady) ok I'll have a regular one, didn't even realize there were different ones.  So she makes it up and asks what else since the Groupon is worth 10.00 and the shawarma is 6.79. I said ok I'll have the lentil soup and drink (the board said add an extra 2.99). She spent the next min or so telling me I can't have that because it's considered a special.  The young guy working the cash register must have noticed how uncomfortable I was looking being constantly told what I am not allowed to have so He stepped in and said that I can have it and pay the difference.   They then whispered to each other a bit.  I said if it's a problem I will get something else, a salad or whatever.  He said no it's ok for the soup and smiled.  She looked even nastier then she did when I walked in. Cool, I'll take it pay the difference and dash out of this place quickly and spare myself any further scolding from young counter girl.  If they are trying to get new business they should get rid of the nasty girl and keep the nice, smiley young guy there.  A tourist with an English accent walked in with a toonie in hand asking for change.  The nice young guy was opening the register to give him change  and nasty girl snapped at tourist guy saying no we have no change. He turned around to go out the door and I offered to change his toonie.  I pulled out my wallet and gave him 2 loonies for his toonie.  That wasn't so difficult, and took a few seconds.  Nasty girl needs to take a nice pill before going to work.  Food was ok, chicken not bad, a bit salty. Pita was super thin and fell apart half way through. Lentil soup is good. Nice flavour almost lemony.  I think the service deserves 2 stars only because of the guy, if he wasn't there I would give it 1 star."}
{"text":"It used to a pretty decent place, good value. However, they recently hired a new lady and the portion is now significantly smaller. A lot of my coworkers are complaining about it. Disappointed :/"}
{"text":"Incredible! I've been to many many shawarma places, but this one was just amazing. Came here at 11 PM on Sunday being super hungry. The super nice lady Fatimah serving me took the time and prepared a feast of shawarma salad place. I loved it so much, didn't get a chance to take a photo. Sufficient amount and unlike other places, she didn't hesitate to fill up my plate, plenty of salad and chicken.  Definitely coming back here. :)"}
{"text":"I really like this franchise so I go to a lot of its stores . as soon as I got in I was greated  with a smile and asked what I wanted. I never tried the falafel, soo I decided it was TIME!! I asked if it was store bought, but the lady quickly told me with pride that it is made from scratch. The got the falafel wrap... It was FANTASTIC... Soo I got 3 falafels to go"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken soulaki plate I have ever had. Delicious food and amazing quantity. Best of all Mediterranean restaurant. So neat and clean  I definitely prefer this place. Overall fabulous must go."}
{"text":"I have tried a few similar  establishments and order falaffel but today was chicken shawarma.    Loaded with flavor and you could taste each and every individual ingredient added.   The only thing I would say needs change is the choice of pita used.  Very thin.  Fell appart easily as I was just unwrapping it.    Service was slower than usually expected on a late end of night, but the wait was somewhat worth it.  Not dying to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty much your basic run of the mill shawarma joint. Chicken shawarma plate was flavoured well and the veggies seemed nice and fresh. Service was average and the location was clean. I wouldn't make a special trip to go here but it's definetly a decent fix if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance one day...sooooooo glad we did!!!...it is now our regular sunday lunch treat..food is fresh, generously portioned and tastes wonderful..and more importantly the owner goes above and beyond to make sure your meal is the best it can be...once he ran out of  whole wheat wraps and substituted white instead and the next time we came in I was not charged for my wrap...we come in now every Sunday"}
{"text":"Excellent kabobs, souvlaki, shawarma as both dinner plates and wraps. Very reasonable prices and daily specials."}
{"text":"Great food!  I got the chicken shawarma plate, and it was delicious.  I like how they grill the chicken after cutting it.  After travelling across the Mediterranean, it's difficult finding authentic food here, but this place is authentic and delicious. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is average at best and quite pricey all things considered. I ordered the chicen schwarma salad, which was lettuce, small portions of things you put in a schwarma, and then so much tzatziki. It was just over 10$, which to me, is quite a pricey salad for a lot of lettuce. The entire thing was SOOOOO SALTY that I couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite shawarma joint by far. The food there tastes so good, just like home cooking. Everything is always so fresh and the owner is generous with the portions. I have ordered the chicken on rice about 4 times (since the first time I've eaten there with my boyfriend who discovered it earlier this year), which is phenomenal, our absolute favourite dish. I have also had a chicken shawarma plate one time, which is filled with so much tender crispy perfectly seasoned pieces of chicken shawarma, rice, salad, dressing, potato slices, eggplant slices, and sauces that could easily feed a family of 4 AND their dog and still have left overs....or just a really hungry person looking to satisfy their appetite (me) lol  Today, I had the chicken shawarma wrap, and like always, it hit the spot! It was perfectly filled with the right amount of chicken and veggies, Pita Lite's secret sauce (addicting) and hot sauce as desired.   One more thing: my boyfriend and I always get a medium sized plate of fries, we ask for it to be topped with a mix of secret sauce and hot sauce...need I say more?   The moral of this review is: if you're looking for THE shawarma place, look no further than this place!   Will definitely be going there again soon :)"}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed me, the foods always fresh and delicious and the service is very prompt. Would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! Large portions at a great price. We ordered Chicken Shawarma plate and really enjoyed it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Shawarma plate is great. The chicken is perfectly cooked and veg selection is great."}
{"text":"First of all the place was very clean. I ordered the chicken laffa but they asked me if they could instead use the souvlaki chicken on the skewers in the wrap instead since they were running low on chicken. Overall, the food was pretty good but I don't think I want to pay close to $10 for a wrap going forward."}
{"text":"Very personable owner. You can tell he takes great pride in the quality of his service and food. Visited on a whim earlier and was so impressed so I decided to come again today. Packs his pita wraps really thick so one is definitely good enough for a meal."}
{"text":"Got the chicken shawarma wrap. Don't know how other things taste, but the chicken was good for the price. Will come back for quick lunch and the staff were friendly in my experience."}
{"text":"I got here all the time! I love the gyro/beef or chicken plate. I recommend the plate because they are very filling. It comes with a delicious Mediterranean rice, 2 potatoes, a Greek salad and your choice meat. I really like the gyro, best on the menu! They have options to add sauces: add tahini, garlic sauce and hot sauce for your liking! Try the eggplants...so good! Hope this helps. I am a repeat customer for sure :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, this was the first place that I have ever tried a falafel. I wouldn't recommend the falafel unless they are supposed to taste like bland balls of sand. :)  What is good? The Chicken Souvlaki! Yum. Nice, juicy marinated chicken and LOTS of veggies and rice come with the dinner combo but I only wish it was $1-2 cheaper...seems a little too pricey here for me but it's nice when I need a little souvlaki fix."}
{"text":"Driving down Matheson I noticed a small plaza which caught my attention and decided to stop for Friday lunch at Pita Lite. Entering the restaurant you immediately notice it is clean with easy to read menus.   They had a falafel wrap special that day however since I'm more of a fan of plates than wraps I decided to order the chicken shawarma plate. The plate came with rice, potatoes, greek salad and of course some chicken shawarma.   Service was great and before I know it I had a nice large meal sitting before my eyes. I must say that the food was very tasty and you can tell everything was fresh.   The salad was full of flavour and the dressing made it even tastier. The rice was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were a nice touch. The chicken shawarma had great flavour and worked very well with the sauces they added however lacked that little bit of crispiness to it that I think is needed for chicken shawarma.   Overall, my experience at Pita Lite was a positive one and I will be coming back in the future to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawerma salad. It was alright. The chicken was a little overcooked, and lacked that \"shawerma flavour and spices\". It was basically a good tasting chicken, not so much shawerma. The salad itself was cold because the lettuce, tomatoes, etc were cold. A good salad is supposed to have all the vegetables at room temperature. The one thing that surprised me was that when I asked for tahini, they had to go inside to grab some for me. I thought tahini was the most common ingredient or topping on shawerma plates and sandwiches. The salad I had was too expensive. $9.50 plus tax for a salad? In a fast food place?"}
{"text":"Usually when I order souvlaki dinner they put more than one piece of potato, and offer more than just a little bit of Tzatziki sauce, but not here! We had to ask several times to put more stuff in the plate. Nothing too special about this place, even though it gets crazy busy. It's just another shawarma place."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for lunch, always making fresh Chicken Souvlaki, great in a wrap. Definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a good wrap/shawarma place."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  Generous portions as well. The owners is very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the wait time and service was terrible .. I called 15 min ahead and still had to wait 15 more min when I go to the restaurant .. I understand that patients is a virtue but I don't see the sense of calling in just to wait 15min again when you get there .. I completely wasted my lunch break and wasn't able to eat because of the wait .. On top of that the owner was being very rude,  I don't really no why because I was very respectable to him while I stood and waited"}
{"text":"Average shawarma place, a bit better then shawarma max across the street in my opinion. I normally go here for convenience. Their chicken shawarma is good but not the best I've had, one problem I face is that it is not consistent time and time again when it's good it's good. When it's an off day the chicken is bland. The same can be said with the portion size for the plates. Sometimes you get a lot of chicken sometimes they like on the rice and give you a small amount of chicken.   At the end of the day it's a decent lunch/ quick bite place but I wouldn't go here expecting great things. Overall it's an average shawarma place."}
{"text":"Falafel was good The chicken shawarma platter was a good serving. Wasn't a fan of their sauces though. Plus the chicken was fatty."}
