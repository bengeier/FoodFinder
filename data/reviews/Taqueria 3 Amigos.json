{"text":"This place is pure trash. Some of the worse Mexican food I've ever had. Weak seasoning and the guacamole was watery. The re fried beans had a weird texture. Ill never go back."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican downtown. Family owned and operated. This place is a hidden Madison gem."}
{"text":"There should be a line coming out the door at this place! Delicious burritos made right in front of you. I got a chicken burrito that also included rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, and a generous amount of guacamole for $9. Definitely going back next time we're on State Street!"}
{"text":"We ordered thru Eatstreet for delivery at lunch. Everybody got the #2 - 3 Tacos. Consensus was that all were good, but the Carnitas the best. Enjoyed them and price was fair."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today for lunch.  Had the 3 soft-shell taco offering.  Had 2 with beef, 1 with chorizo.  Very satisfying meal.  Nice people, too!"}
{"text":"Such great service and delicious food. This place is so welcoming and I'm so glad they're on Willy now--never leave us!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican. Excellent service. Not the flashiest place, but that's not the point; the point is great Mexican food and they deliver.   Everything from the carnita tacos to asada burritos to chicken buritto bowls had good portions and were well seasoned. The owner always double checks to ensure I get my orders the way I want them. Nice little family owned spot in the heart of downtown. A true gem amidst the cheese and guac smothering, over-seasoning bigger chains.  They don't overspice your order unless you ask for it. A good place if you don't mind adjusting your order for preferred flavor. Not so great if you expect them to read minds and have a condiment preferred palate like one reviewer..."}
{"text":"I went there late night. The food was great and served very fast. The steak was perfectly cooked and overall the food was awesome. I've lived downtown for 16 years, and my first try was not as good. However, I gave it a second shot and WOW, the food... I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick meal! Tacos and burritos are delicious, meat is well seasoned, and the service is very friendly. Their spicy salsa is no joke. Will return regularly!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner, Juan, is kind and offers a friendly greeting every time I walk through the door. This is the only authentic Mexican food you'll find downtown. Stop here for quick, tasty tacos and Jarritos    Skip Chipotle and support this local business!   P.S. I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about; the refried beans are great."}
