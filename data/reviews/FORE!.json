{"text":"This is a tiny place in a shop dominated by Harris-Teeter.  The golf theme makes no sense to me.  There is no golf course or golf shop nearby.  It is very attractive inside, dominated by a great-looking bar.  I was there for what I hoped would be a quick lunch before shopping for groceries.  I had a buffalo chicken wrap.  The chicken was in small pieces, overcooked, and overwhelmed by lettuce, which in turn was overwhelmed by the hot sauce.  There was just nothing to like about it.  The service was slow and indifferent.

I had a sense that they are trying to provide good food and good service, but, there was nothing in my one experience there to persuade me to try again.  Your results may vary."}
{"text":"Delicious, and something for everyone.  We recently went for Sunday brunch..I had a delicious beet, goat cheese spinach salad, while others had fish & chips ( raved that the best they've had, with amazing homemade tarter sauce) and a Buffalo chicken wrap ( large, spicy and very good). Other options were omelets, French Toast, eggs fruit...the menu is small but varied, as they rely on supporting local farmers for their meat & produce.  Again, there were options for all in our party.  We will go back and bring the kids next time."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch. I recommend the chicken Caesar wrap. The fries were hot and crisp, the wrap was delicious! Staff is very friendly, place is extremely clean."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! An hour to be served our lunch!!!! Had to go to bar to get my drinks refilled. Buyers beware!"}

Issues - Long time to get meal, meal prepared incorrectly, poor service

We (group of 4) arrived around 6:45pm for dinner.  We sat at an open table without any issues as the restaurant is quite small.  We all got water to start with as we looked over the menu.  It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to finally come back with the water.  At that time we ordered an appetizer to share (luckily).  We got the nachos which were good, but they didn't seem too difficult to make (appeared to be just chips topped with shredded cheese and warmed up then topped with a few toppings, not a huge portion as the four of us finished it within two minutes).

After that, and waiting another 10 minutes to get some more water (the waiter brought over new waters instead of just refilling our glasses), we ordered entrees.  We ordered off the lunch and breakfast menus as they serve all the menus at night.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with some modifications (grilled chicken instead of fried chicken, no tomatoes, ranch instead of blue cheese, and a salad for my side item).  Another one of our party ordered the exact same entree.  One member ordered off the breakfast menu (eggs, bacon, pancakes).

10 minutes later our waiter came back and asked my friend if he, \"really wanted eggs?\", and, \"if he would rather order something else\".  He indicated that it was his first night - ISSUE - why is a waiter working alone serving tables on his first night...isn't there some type of training program or shadow server to ensure it goes well?  Anyway, we assumed that they had ran out of eggs and ran to Harris Teeter to get some, but who knows.  The server said that it was due to the small kitchen....ISSUE - if you can't cook a meal for a table of four in your kitchen, maybe the kitchen needs to be bigger/menu modified/etc.  My friend asked for the other food to come out first, then bring the eggs later.

20 minutes later our food arrived.  While, we did make modifications on the wrap, they both came out incorrectly.  They did correctly give us grilled chicken, but tomatoes were included and we had fries as our side.  The food was actually OK and a good value for the price.

We ate in about 10-15 minutes, got our checks, promptly paid, and left at 8:15pm (that's a 90 minute dinner at a \"bar type\" restaurant with uncomplex foods, no \"drinks\".  Luckily, I was around good company, but the restaurant appears completely understaffed (2 or 3 people working the entire restaurant).  Will not be back anytime soon.  We would rather go to Killingtons hands down for the same type of food, but a lot better service."}
