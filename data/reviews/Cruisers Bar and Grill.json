{"text":"The worst dining experience that I have ever had. Made a reservation for 15 since it was the only place in the area that took reservations. The service was unbelievably poor. 15 minutes after the only mixed drink was ordered, we went up to the bar to re-order it and bring it back to the table. The water glasses were empty the whole time until someone at our table thought to just ask for pitchers of water. The waitress acted annoyed with us the whole time. When the food was finally brought out, the waitress told us that one person at our table's food was not available and asked what he would like instead. This was 30 minutes after we had placed our orders! Another meal was never made, so the two steaks came out about 15 minutes later, but they were horribly cooked. The management almost didn't compensate us for both meals, but eventually did. We went up to the bar multiple times for forks, napkins, etc that the waitress never brought out to us, including a pen to fill out the check with. I am usually patient when it comes to slow or poor service, but this was outrageous. When we paid our bill, they cranked up the music so we would leave which we did, happily, and will never return."}
{"text":"Visited cruisers twice over the weekend while staying at the hotel for a dart tournament. I cant say that either visit was enjoyable. The first was saturday night, it took the staff working the bar about 20 minutes to even approach me. and then another 15 minutes after i got a menu for them to ask what I would like. Another 30 minutes later my meal arrived. Luckily I didnt have another match in the tournament for a while or I would have missed it. The food was actually decent and the portion size was pretty big. The prices were a bit inflated though. 20.00 for Fish and rice and veggies.   The next day I had lunch with a friend in there. Different server but same situation. Instead of them asking what we would like to drink or even giving us a menu they decided to clean the bar and the floor. After about 20 minutes of that we finally got offered drinks and a menu. The drinks were served in plastic solo cups. Now im not a snob... but if the items on the menu are averaging between 15.00-25.00 then I would hope to get an actual GLASS. And again, the food took an extremely long time to get to us. 30 minutes to make a caesar salad and a quesadilla??   The part we really had an issue with was the staff member was not being very sanitary. While she was cleaning, someone ordered so olives with a drink, she proceeded to grab a giant jar of them and then reach her bare hand into the jar and start rooting around for a handful, and then dropped them into the drink. A little while later after working with the chemicals to clean the bar with she reached back into the same jar and filled the garnish bins.  I think next time im there ill make the 15 minute drive up the interstate to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had got in late on a Thursday night and the main restaurant was closed (Hudson Room) but we went to Cruisers Bar and Grill.  The bartenders were great and the food was awesome.  My husband and I shared the Mac N Cheese.  It was awesome, and so was the side salad.  I would recommend eating at this place regularly."}
{"text":"Sitting at the table right now. Have not even received the food and already have awful service. The bartenders do not care about customer service and one already told off a customer at the bar just for trying to order.  Too bad this is the only thing attached to the hotel and only place for a few miles."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant at the Clarion. It's pretty much your only choice if you're staying there and don't want to go out for dinner, but it's not a bad choice for decent pub food and dinner specials. They have happy hour prices on a couple of beers (I believe Yuengling and something else), and several others on draft, including at least one Great Lakes beer, which satisfied me.   They also have daily specials, and the night I was there it was 50 cent wings of about a dozen types. I ordered some in a style I had never had before, lemon pepper. These were pretty tasty, and combined with a house salad and a discounted beer (the hotel will give you a coupon for $2.50 for a non-happy-hour beer), I had a decent dinner.  Service was good but awkward. I sat at the bar, and the 2 women there, I guess a bartender and a waitress, couldn't really agree on which of them was handling my order, so they kinda sorta both did, without really letting each other know they were doing that."}
{"text":"Glad to see they remained open. We had the ribs and the spinach and chicken mac and cheese with tossed salad. The food was excellent and the prices were right for the quantity received. Bar tender was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm usually very weary of hotel restaurants. Typically populated by the local bar fly trolling for the unexpecting female business traveler.   This was a VERY pleasant surprise to the contrary.   I was quickly greeted by a very pleasant bartender asking if I would like something to drink. The beer was fresh, very cold and served in a spotless pint glass.  I ordered the reuben & fries which I was impressed by. A reuben is one of my typical sandwich orders when I travel...I've ordered hundreds of these during the past twenty years of business travel and I have to say this was better....much better than the norm.  The fries seemed to be fresh cut and double fried. Very nice flavor."}
{"text":"Not a gourmet restaurant, but nice enough to chill with some food and drinks. The servers are overall nice and efficient, even when it's just one waitress running the place on Sunday night.  The place is dark and kind of divvy, but we have a good time every year while at the various local film festivals.  Saturday night the DJ is for sure a small town DJ, and the music is so loud that we all end up in the hotel lobby.  Every so often, you order something from the menu and you get a slightly different thing, but overall it'll get you going for a few hours. The Mac and cheese is probably the best thing in the menu."}
{"text":"Decent menu selection, but WAY over priced for what it is. Much better food can be found for much better prices within 5 to 10 minutes of the hotel (in which it is located). The ambiance is something like a dive bar. You can get much better bang for your buck elsewhere."}
