{"text":"This is a hidden gem, the pretzels, sandwiches, potato crisps and milkshakes are devine. If you haven't eaten here yet, now is the time to come on over, you will love it. Special requests are accommodated."}
{"text":"This is a great little place located in the south suburbs. We were greeted by the friendly owner who took the time to explain the menu and how all the meat is fresh, not deli meat, and the spreads/ sauces are in house made. You can choose the sandwiches on the board or decide on your own fillings. They also offer a few side salads and sweet pretzels.  Our sandwiches were brought out to us, and were they ever huge! My boyfriend couldn't finish his. The ingredients were fresh and so was the pretzel bread.  I am craving more of the ginger carrots that were put on my veggie sandwich.  The owners wife came up to us before we left to apologize for having her children in the shop and running around. She offered us some free cookies she baked earlier. A very sweet gesture since the kids weren't bothering us at all, but she insisted. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There would be a picture if the sandwich had lasted longer ;) Top. Notch. I had the northern twist and the fried egg was an amazing touch! Can't wait to go back and try the potato crisps and a pretzel. Tucked away hiding behind co-op and well worth the hunt."}
{"text":"Delicious, especially if you're looking for vegan options!! The man who  helped us was super friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients. I ordered an onion bagel and was expecting a regular bagel with a hint in onion flavoring, and was delighted when it arrived covered in freshly made caramelized onions! I'll absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Very yummy. Just wish the price was a little better for the sandwiches. The staff are always really nice. Restaurant is always really clean."}
{"text":"Mmmmm super delicious sandwiches, can't wait to try all the dipping sauces for the pretzels!!! It's a little hard to find, go to the co-op building and go to the very west end, sort of behind the CIBC.  I would recommend to the owners that they find a more ventilated packing system for to-go orders, sandwich gets too soggy by the time you get it home."}
{"text":"Hard to find but totally worth searching out.   Awesome house made pretzels and sauces. Wife had a sandwich and loved it. Owners very nice ensuring we enjoyed our visit.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The guy who works here is a gem super nice! And is fresh and lots of selections of sauces to dip it's a hidden building worth checking out! And it's a good price too"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find. It's actually West of the Co op a couple of doors down. The guy working the till is friendly and I'm assuming the owner. On this particular visit it wasn't very busy. There were two other customers that ordered take away. The pretzels aren't cheap, 4 bucks a piece. They have a big selection on dipping sauces as well.  I purchased 3 pretzels, two with salt and the other one cinnamon. The part that disappointed me is that they aren't made fresh. They throw the premade pretzels into a warming oven. I might be a bit of a pretzel snob, as I'm used to the Wetzels Pretzels in the U.S. My apologies ATB pretzel. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little gem tucked behind the Co-op in Deer Valley Shopping Mall. Great variety and having a sandwich made on a pretzel bun is a win for me every time. I'm never buying another sandwich from Subway ever again now that I've tried \"Around the Bend\"."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich !  What a terrible location to find but Wow !  Fresh in house made meats and ingredients,  my only regret is not having enough appetite left to try one of the pretzels !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been meaning to go to Around the Bend for a couple of years.  We have a major pretzel addiction, and go through major withdrawl here in Calgary.  Sadly the Wetzel's Pretzels stand at WEM doesn't quite do the trick.  So we finally went and kicked ourselves for not going sooner!    Around the Bend is an awesome little local spot in Deer Run.  It is literally around the bend from the larger stores in the shopping plaza, so you do have to look for it.  The hunt is worth it!  Seriously the BEST hot and fresh pretzels I have ever had.  I had the cheese pretzel with cheese sauce, and Kieran had the regular pretzel with garlic butter, along with a side of chips.  As someone else wrote, yes they are seriously addictive - like a chip/fry combo, delicious salty goodness.  I was really impressed that the owner came to our table to talk to us, and ask for our feedback and how we found the shop.  He was really friendly and open to feedback - I hope they are able to find a better location where they can get more visibility to their awesome eats!  The ONLY reason I did not give 5 stars...and if I could give 4.5 I would...was that the cheese sauce was a let-down.  I was expecting really thick, extra gooey and cheesy sauce, but the fresh cheese sauce was more watery IMO.  And the tables needed a wipedown (sorry!).  Other than that, everything was to die for.  The garlic butter is the bomb - we even took the rest of our little cup home with us, no way were we throwing it out!  We're looking forward to going back soon for more yummy deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Great little place tucked away in the SE. Had the Greek Twist and my bf had the Southwestern pretzel sandwich. If you love garlic, I highly recommend the Greek twist! The tzaztiki is homemade with love, I might add.  The southwestern was stacked high with lots fresh ingredients. Highly recommend! Will be back to try the pretzels!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place and I was annoyed before I even got there because this place was so hard to find but when I finally found it, it was so worth it.  This place makes all there own breads and meats. I got a cheese pretzel to start and I would highly recommend it.  I also got the California Twist and Steak Frite sandwich. If you like the taste of the pretzel and how salty it is you will love the sandwiches. I didn't like the California Twist so much but the Steak Frite was amazing with potato chips right on the sandwich layered with meat and cheese sauce :)"}
{"text":"My wife loves her pretzels and this place meets her expert opinion on pretzel eating as a great place to get a pretzel. Staff was awesome and completely explained the whole menu as they asked if it was our first time. We will return for sure as it's affordable and they make everything fresh  in house including their sauces and meats for sandwiches."}
{"text":"I found out about around the bend last week. So I planed an adventure evening to go over to the other side of town just to try a pretzel. I haven't been to the states in almost a year and I always get soft pretzels when I'm there.  I was excited to try and experience something similar in town.     I ended up visiting this place right after a little bit of a rainstorm so not a single person was in the store but myself. Worked perfectly in my flavour because I could be a little bit needy with my order. The owner was working the counter and he went through the menu and how it all worked with me it made the whole experience completely personalized. Loved it!    I ended up ordering 6 pretzels and sides to go. It took a little bit of time because the food is made to order. Each one was individual wrapped with a corresponding dip. When I got to where I was heading I opened all of them up and mixed matched all the dips with the different seasoned pretzels. All was so good!   Satisfied"}
{"text":"You would never find this place if you didn't have someone take you there because it is a well kept secret tucked away in a strip mall. My nephew chose where we were going for lunch and I can't wait to go back. I just said, \"sure, I'll have what he's having\" and we had the steak frites. The BEST, most creative and delicious sandwich I have ever had. I was starving and still could not get through the whole sandwich. I wanted to keep eating because it was so good but took the rest home for my daughter who loved it as well."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and friends and one of my friends to me here. And I am happy we went as the food was incredible! I love the concept of the pretzel bun and a nice complement especially with the steak sandwich.   Everything is so fresh and they use real meats rather then the so called Deli style! And they will make the sandwich how ever you like so if you don't want it too soggy they will reduce the sauces (but the sauce is needed as it's part of the sandwiches charm).  This place takes the concept of an old school Deli and changes it up a bit. I love their homemade potato chips as I could sit and eat those none stop! A nice treat! And they are always experimenting with something new in the kitchen for their specials!  All in all I will be back next time I am in Calgary as this is a nice little neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"Beyond helpful at the counter. It was my first time, and I didn't even have to specify that. The gentleman asked if I'd like help with the menu and gave me a full rundown along with suggestions.  I don't even have words to describe how good my pretzel was. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Steak Frites Twist today and it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The place is a little hard to find but well worth the search as the sandwich is huge, packed with flavour, and the frites give the sandwich a nice crunch. The sandwich is seriously addicting."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and all of my visits have been excellent.  The potato crisps are like crack. They're made fresh to order so they're warm, crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. I could almost just have a couple orders of them and skip the sandwiches. That being said, the sandwiches really can't be skipped. They're huge and delicious. Some are messier than others so grab a few extra napkins.   The first time I came in the owner gave my wife and I the full run down and was very helpful in our ordering. Subsequent visits have been just as friendly.  My only complaint is that they were hard to find the first time. They're on the NW corner of the CO-OP so you can't really see them when driving around the parking lot. They're hidden down the lane between CO-OP and the bank."}
