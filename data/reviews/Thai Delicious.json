{"text":"My husband and I shared Thai spring  rolls, chicken cashew nut, pineapple curry , coconut  rice and sticky rice. It was all delicious will certainly go back. We also shared the fish cakes appetizer which was not my favourite, but then again I usually don't like fish cakes.:)  We usually eat in rather than take away."}
{"text":"Great service with amazing food! The Thai green curry was delicious and spicy just how we like it. Their basil fried rice was very good too. The quantities were just right for 2 people. They even had coconut water with coconut pieces in it!

Definitely recommend whitby locals to go here!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Tom Yum noodle soup is lovely and light. Took 3 dish's for take out after a full meal.
Young lady serving us was very good and adorable."}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place only has 3 stars.  I came back from a 1 month vacation in Thailand and this is the only spot that has come close to the flavours of Thailand.  Great food, so so service & very affordable.  

Came in with 3 work buddies and all of us were blown away. I don't normally write reviews and only made the exception to help them out bc I truly didn't feel like they deserve 3 stars.  This spot deserves a 5 star."}
{"text":"We love thai food and have it twice a week.
To top up with a bad attitude  was a sluggish service and low quality watery curries.
Waste of money, would never visit or recommend"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if that was an option. Chicken pad Thai had maybe two small slivers of chicken in it... basically ordered plain rice noodles.. no flavour, no veggies. Beef panang had hardly any curry sauce to it and the portion was TINY and didn't even come with steamed rice. It was also COLD as if they pulled it from the fridge and stuck it in the container. We ordered delivery and when I called to ask for a refund the girl on the phone said \"come and return the food to us\"... WARNING YOU NOT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. You're better off eating a microwaveable dinner from a box."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered from Thai Delicious for the first time using Just-Eats and was extremely disappointed. I ordered the Tom Yum soup, the spicy beef and the pineapple chicken fried rice. My bill came to $40 with tax, tip and delivery.

To start, the portion sizes were small. The beef was sprinkled on top of the takeout container and carrots covered the bottom of the takeout dish as filler. There was barely any meat. The rice was completely tasteless. To top it off, I was eating my soup, which wasn't flavourful at all (I've had better at the mall food court) - and I found a hair. 

I called to complain right away and the girl said \"I'm sorry to hear that. The next time you order, please put that in the comment box and we'll give you something.\" I don't know what exactly that means but I will never be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Small, quiet place. Had lunch here at 3:00pm. Prices are reasonable and food is delicious. Fast service. Im definitely going to stop here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and good service. First timers and we really enjoyed it. The food was flavorful with generous portions. Service was very good and the meal was easy on the pocketbook. Glad we found this restaurant and we can hardly wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the following for delivery:
Spring rolls
Mango salad
Spicy beef and broccoli
Pad Thai
Mixed vegetables

The food was average. I wouldn't say it was bland, but it did lack some flavour. The spring rolls had an unusually thick shell, which meant there was little stuffing. The mango salad wasn't bad, but the pieces of mango were sliced thicker than my liking. I liked that the spicy beef and broccoli didn't have a goopy sauce. It wasn't the least bit spicy, though, and the beef was tough and chewy. It came with about 3 small stalks of broccoli. The mixed vegetables also came without a thick goopy sauce (great), but all of the vegetables were cut into really small pieces.

Overall, the food was mediocre but the portion sizes were TINY for the price in comparison to the other Thai restaurants. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Garlic spicy beef had good seasoning but the meat was rubbery and over cooked. I think they used the lowest grade beef (I don't even know if it was beef to be honest) they could find.

Pad Thai noodles were kind of dry, and lacked flavour.

Portion sizes are a joke unless maybe the driver ate half of each container on his way over.

I'm underwhelmed by the quality of the food and I'm feeling a bit ripped off at the portions they give for the price they charge.

I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery via Just Eat twice now and both times I've been pleasantly surprised by the time-machine-like delivery and quality of the food. I placed an order that was confirmed at 4:53p and it arrived at 5:10. I had to look at a map and make sure they weren't in my basement. I've had the spring rolls, pad thai, spicy basil noodle, and Tom Yum, plus the mango w/sticky rice (which is sometimes hard to get). The Tom Yum wasn't as spicy as I've had other places, but it was perfect for me because I'm a wimp. that pad thai is good, a little oily but not sickeningly sweet. The spring rolls were delicious the first time and kind of so-so the second time, so I guess I'll just have to keep ordering them. Decent sized servings for the price. Highly recommend if you're in a hurry and desperately need Thai."}
