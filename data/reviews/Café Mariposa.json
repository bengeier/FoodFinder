{"text":"Cool atmosphere and staff was very friendly however brunch was horrible. Runny egg whites and everything was cold. The place was soo cool and the staff soo friendly that I'm willing to give it another try but only for supper. Brunch was a bust!"}
{"text":"Want to chill out for a while in a really easygoing cafe and listen to live music?   This is an amazing spot for that.    Decor is really eclectic, kind of like someone's very comfortable basement full of art, guitars, random chairs.....nothing matches and it's charming as hell.
Service was excellent - the girl working had a terrific personality, was happy to talk about open mike night and the evenings with live music and weekend brunch.     You should go - you'll be treated really well, you'll probably hear some local or visiting musicians and you'll have a great coffee!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and yummy brunch food. We were visiting and looking for a place to have breakfast with 6 people. We sat on the patio with 4 kids. The staff was very warm and tolerant -- a relief. They brought us a basket of toast with butter and jam while we waited for the entrees. Sitting on the patio was gorgeous in the summer. People strolled by with their dogs, and the kids were entertained. Plus, we didn't worry about being too loud or bothering the other diners because there is really only one table. The food was lovingly prepared, down to the dusting of cinnamon on the sliced apple garnish. I was surprised by the delicious pillowy pierogi that came with each plate. They were light and flavorful -- and gluten free! The bacon was perfect too. The waitress recommended the waffle and it did not disappoint. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I didn't grow up in the sixties, but I imagine this is what it felt like! Caf√© Mariposa is a neighbourhood arts venue that caters to musicians, though every time I've been they've also had vernissages (both photography and paintings). My neighbour also hosted a cancer fundraiser there sot hey do a bit of everything. 

I went to their spaghetti western night where they served spaghetti and played western music! It happened to be the lead singer's birthday and we all enjoyed some cake together. I've also had their brunch a handful of times. The waffles and sausages are delicious what kept me coming back for their brunch. The staff is super friendly. And it has a \"welcome home\" feel the place.

I'm not a musician, but other musicians may want to check it out. Their open mic night is supposed to be a lot of fun, but I haven't yet been."}
