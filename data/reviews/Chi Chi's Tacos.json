{"text":"I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out. It turned out to effen awesome. Fresh quality food!  ChiChi- lisous! Be on the look out for these guys! Chow down baby."}
{"text":"I was checking out this Art district and there was live music with several studios in the area, I went over to the \"Of The Earth Cafe\" and out front there was a taco stand with the owner Shane grilling up street tacos.  I had both the beef and chicken and I have to say they were both great.  The chicken had a great seasoned flavor and he even made his own homemade green chili hot sauce that tasted so fresh and flavorful.  I heard that this area gets hopping ever first Friday but I decided to stop by after the Suns game and check it out last night.  Also ask about the sweet potato taco desert they have!"}
{"text":"Good, but the raves go a bit far. Atmosphere and service are a downgrade although far from being a disqualifier. They should be included in the talk about best taco and burro, but I can think of at least 3 I'd place above within a 10 min drive."}
{"text":"Make sure you get some of these Chichis Tacos! Made with love and dedication this husband and wife dynamic duo have created recipes that truly make your mouth water!
