{"text":"I am so happy to have found this place. I got the chicken shawarma plate which I think cost less than $8. It was so huge it fed two of us! They grill the chicken as you order it.

Keep in mind, it is a small store with limited seating so it is best to get it to go."}
{"text":"A perfect combination of fresh and tasty food with outstanding value.  For $8.00 you can get a lunch special of an awesome salad, with rice and  lentils with a chicken skewer,  beef skewer or shawarma.  You will be seriously full after tackling this mountain of yummyness.  I go a few times a week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything is so incredibly fresh and the meat is always juicy. I can't emphasize how fresh everything really is. The staff is also lovely and friendly. The only downside of Salad House is their limited hours."}
{"text":"My new go-to lunch spot when I don't bring my own lunch. 

The spot itself is a no frills take out kitchen - you first go to the cashier to order and are given a receipt. You then take the receipt to one of two serving areas where you then customize your order.

The staff here is very courteous and was very patient even when I was very indecisive about my order. They were willing to customize my order every step of the way.

Value for money - bar none. As other reviews attest to, the portions are huge. It legitimately extends my lunch when I get a large because of how long it takes me to get through the food. 

Everything I've had here has been fresh and delicious.

Protip - if you're a fan eggplant, get the grilled vegetables for only a dollar more! In addition to eggplant, you get grilled peppers and zucchini with this add on!"}
{"text":"What can I say. This is truly a hidden gem, hole-in-the-wall place. In brief, the portions are HUGE, the prices are totally reasonable, the food tastes great, and the service is quick and friendly!

I had the large chicken shawarma platter (holy shit, it should be called the MASSIVE chicken shawarma platter). It comes with rice, salad, and chicken. On top of that, I added sauces, lentils, and chickpeas. I could barely finish it all! You can choose what to put on the salad and how much you want of everything - and it's all a set price already! When, not if, I come by again, I will happily get the small, and still leave feeling full!

Another bonus, this is also relatively healthy compared to most lunch options.

The only downside of this place is that it's not closer to where I work. Otherwise, this could easily become one of my go-to lunch spots. I'd definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and tasty and huge portions! One of the best food joints in the City, nothing in this area comes even close!

Extremely friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's owned/run by the friendly Egyptian guy who used to own/run Salad Days in Cumberland Terrace. He sold that to his old partner and opened this joint (how do I know all this? I like talking/asking questions).

HUGE portions of AMAZING food. Mostly healthy stuff like lentils on rice, huge salads, in-house grilled veggies, etc. Also shawarma, falafel etc.

I always get the Vegetable Plate, which is curried lentil or chickpea on rice, a massive salad with all the fixins, falafel, stuffed vine leaves, grilled veggies, hummus, tabbouleh, and all those funky mid-east things like marinated mushrooms, pickled radish, etc. It costs like $7.50 and will feed a small family. 

Oh, and everyone there is friendly and pleasant. Just as a bonus. Go. Now."}
{"text":"No place to sit , it is more of a walk in restaurant. Big portions and it's is fill u up but didn't feel right. More salad then anything else. 7.99$ and they only take cash too.

Wasn't bad but at the same time it wasn't that good.

Portions 4/5
Service 3/5
Foods 3/5"}
{"text":"The food is quick,  quality is good and best of all it is delicious. Good prices,  especially with the generous portions.

Staff are friendly,  good service. 

There's a lot of construction on the east side of the road but don't let that stop you. 

Note: it's a cash only place. Not a big deal,  just good to know ahead of time."}
{"text":"**HUGE PORTIONS** this place actually just owns, I filtered for the highest reviews on yelp a few days ago and I am super happy to have found this small little joint that is located 1 minute away from where I live. I ordered the large chicken shawarma plate for $10 and boy was I not disappointed. The large plate will get you enough food for maybe ~3 people, it's like a mountain of salad, lentils, sauces, assorted vegetables, and more. The dude that works there didn't even care, man, he just keeps piling the food onto my plate like its nothing. The ingredients were very fresh, and the chicken was crispy yet juicy. Very delicious. I will definitely be eating here regularly!

For those wondering about their store hours, the nice lady at the counter said they are open from 11am to 7pm."}
{"text":"I find it really easy to confuse the people working 

The Pros:

* The food is super cheap. Two people could easily eat one meal for less than $10.
* The quality is fantastic. My mouth is watering as I think about it.
* There are plenty of veg/vegan/gluten free options. The salads are monstrous.

The Cons:

* The line ups are long and confusing. You have to get in one line up at the front to pay... and then once you pay you get into a confusing, winding line-up that defies all logic. It's enough to make you want to avoid the place during lunch.

* They only take cash. This caused a lot of stress for the 5 of us who came to the restaurant for lunch... and I ended up paying for everyone because no one carries cash anymore. Forget it if you need a receipt (for expensing).

Tips:

* The small is plenty of food for one person... and the large might be a bit too much. 
* It's a cash only establishment.
* It's takeaway only; there is no seating and if there was it would be really unpleasant because of the number of people that are squished into various lines."}
{"text":"The BEST Chicken Shawarma Salad.
Such an amazing little spot. Portion sizes are great, chicken is flavourful and juicy. Good variety of fresh vegetables. The owner is so kind."}
{"text":"Good quality ingredients, well worth the money. They use real spring mix as the base for their salads, not that iceberg crap. The chicken was tender and well spiced. The server put 4 whole spoons of feta on my salad, and a generous helping of hummus. These little details make a big difference and make me feel better spending the $10 on my (huge!) meal. Overall, I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"A new, younger gentleman has started working at The Salad House and his Schwarma wrap game needs some help! I hope the two SH legends will teach him. When we are in line, my colleagues and I avoid him by letting people in front so we can get the SH masters to prepare our wrap.  This new, younger gentleman stuffs the wraps full with salad and doesn't balance the toppings well. Yesterday I had the Schwarma wrap and I had many bites of just lettuce. When he makes a wrap I give it 2 \ 5. When the SH Legends make it is a 5 \ 5."}
{"text":"This place redefines the meaning of \"small\". I watched and marveled as they were constructing my \"small\" chicken shawarma meal. It was packed to the brim and that was before any of the generously portioned chicken was placed on top. It wouldn't matter as much if the taste wasn't up to par but that's not the case here. The flavours all worked together without anything being too distinct and distracting. It's a far walk from my workplace but it's a walk that I'll look forward to making again very soon."}

A big container
A super-b clean set up

{"text":"I had been meaning to stop by this place for a while, but the hours just never worked for me, until today.  Where do I start.. This place is honestly amazing! 

I got the small chicken shawarma plate (6.99), and it was massive! I usually have a pretty big appetite,  but I got full half way through eating it lol. 

Amazing quality, Everything is fresh and delicious!  I will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it came out to $9.50 (including tax). It was one of the largest shawarma plates that I have ever gotten in my life. Not only that, it was healthier than other places since they provided the option for mashed sweet potatos, salad and other items. By the time, I finished selecting all the different items, the staff member could barely push the takeout lid down on it. Portion size and quality was there and when coupled with friendly staff, it makes for a highly recommend by me!"}
{"text":"I'm so shocked I haven't already reviewed this spot.  It deserves several reviews from me. 

One of the best salads I've eaten (I get the shwarma salad), and easily the best bang for your buck, meal wise, in the downtown sector.  All fresh, quality ingredients, varied sides added into your salad from avocado to mashed sweet potato, tabouleh, home made hummus, tiziki, etc., etc..  Massive portions, as everyone has noted.  A large is like two meals.  The flavours compliment each other so harmoniously.  

Ok, so it's basically like someone took a soulful devotional hymn and put it in your mouth and closed your mouth back with said hymn lodged inside.  And as you chewed and swallowed the melody would vary slightly to higher and higher crescendos until you feel your cheeks wet with tears of appreciation.  

I've seen a man take a bite of Salad House salad and just stand up where he was.  Hesaid nothing and gave no notice that he was leaving our company.  He just left.  Took a bite, eyes welled up and he got up and just left.  When he returned I found out he went to have a cry in the washrooms and then went back to Salad House to try to kiss the owner (he was unsuccessful in this, but he did get to cop a feel at least).

Speaking of the owner, he's a real nice, genuinely helpful guy.  Staff is great.  Food is amazing.  Whenever I grab a meal from here I also grab a lottery ticket since it's always a lucky day when I eat Salad House.  So far I've won the jackpot 4 times and counting.  I don't even cash in the tickets anymore.  \"My wealth is my Salad House meal\" I always say.  I'm getting that on a T-shirt so stay on the lookout for me.

And I'm sure I've said enough by now.  You need to eat this food, sucka!  Change your bum life with a meal from Salad House today!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch option for the bloor/yonge area. Portions are huge, chicken is really flavorful and there are tons of customization options.
So glad my coworker introduced me to this place! However I can never finish so I always have to find a coworker to split the meal with me.
Even though I'm completely stuffed after eating here, everything is really healthy so I don't feel gross after!"}
{"text":"Pretty much all the reviews are the same including this one.

The portions are huge, the value is incredible and the quality is great.

Lines will build up during peak times but it is well worth it in my opinion.

One of the large plates of food is enough for me, my girlfriend and we still usually have leftovers when we are full.

Give this place a shot if you are passing by or give it a more permanent spot in your rotation if you live or work nearby."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite kebab and shawarma salad place... the owner recently hired new staff, and the food quality and portions has gone way down. For the first time, I had really poor food from there. My wrap was greasy and mostly burnt. To the point that I ended up abandoning it in the garbage. They also forgot my eggs and grape Vines.... if this continues, I will not be returning. Which would be such a shame because the owner is such a good and nice person. I would hate to see their business go down because of this."}
{"text":"This place is the reason I eat salad. It's staffed by the most lovely Middle eastern gentlemen.

The lunch special is my go to meal. For $11 you get rice, lentels, leafy greens, topped with a selection of diced vegetables and your choice of protine. You have to ask for  roasted vegetables but they are worth the extra dollar.

There is very little room to sit, you are almoat always better off getting take away. 

It gets very busy right  at noon, so come a half hour early or after one, or you will be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"Cheap eats with large volume and good flavour is tough to find around the Yonge/Bloor area, Salad House is probably easily overlooked due to its deceptive name and mediocre exterior. If you love shawarma plates, this is your stop! Forget the fact they're called \"salad\" house! If you're looking for salad, are vegetarian, or you have dietary restrictions, they're not the choice for you just by the nature of their menu offerings, sorry!

Take-out only, simple menu, cash only. Pay up front, then join the line to put your order in for fulfillment by the kitchen. The \"small\" lunch order portion is a full regular styrofoam box, while the \"large\" is a full square styrofoam box (you know, the one with the two small partitions and one large partition?). For those of us with a normal appetite, the small is more than enough! The regular lunch order comes with rice, salad, toppings, sauces, and your meat selection. Skip on rice and opt for all salad if you're taking it easy on the carbs or have a small appetite. Sauces are limited, but this didn't cause a problem for me. My plate was flavourful and a ton of filling food, prepared in front of me and good to the last bite. Definitely a no-frills, easy, greasy, lunch option.

Be warned - the line gets long right at noon and doesn't wane until past 12:30pm. If you're coming be sure to have patience or plan to show up early!

Tip for those of us with a small appetite - find a buddy that shares the same taste buds and order a large. It'll fill you both and since it's takeout, you can head back to your office to split the loot easily. Cutlery and napkins are self-packed, so it's easy to get extras as needed. Styrofoam boxes are not the most environmental, so be sure to maximize by utilizing the two halves to the fullest!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite mediterranean joint in Toronto. Everything is always always fresh and their hummus is off the hook. I've been coming here for the past 3 years and it hasn't disappointed. The only thing is that the price of their meals have increased twice in the past 2 years but still I stay loyal."}
{"text":"But is a small really a small?! The portion sizes here are huge! I can normally finish \"regular sizes\" at other fast food joints but I could barely finish the \"small\" here. That being said, the food itself was just mediocre. I ordered a chicken shawarma lunch for $8.50, which came up to a little under $10 after tax. The vegetable toppings were all very fresh and juicy but I found that the chicken was a little too tough/burnt. My rating and my enjoyment of this dish would've been significantly better if the chicken were more tender. Oh well!

Overall, this isn't my favourite to-go place, but I think it would be a great option for a quick, affordable, filling meal if I were in the area!"}
{"text":"WHAT. 6.99 for a 'small' chicken shawarma I can barely finish? Theres like 2 pounds of food in this box..... Amazing HUGE portions, everything super fresh, and just super delicious. This is analogous to Halal guys of NYC in Toronto ladies and gents.... GO."}
{"text":"OK I came back to update my reviews because this place has an amazing smoked salmon salad. Trust me when I say they are super generous with their portions! They covered the whole salad with smoked salmon and everyone that saw it at work asked me where I got it lol. This place definitely deserves my money for their generosity!"}
{"text":"Still in great food, but prices have gone up again.

Small shwarma lunch special is 7.99 now (though could serve two) and large is now 9.99+tax."}
{"text":"Salad lunchers unite! This hole in the wall salad spot is fantastic. Great variety and quantity all under 10 bucks. No card payment options won't hold you back"}
{"text":"Congratulations to this crew that decipher the mind of the \"want to be healthy\" people working around. 

One day passing by the street I saw a beautiful girl through the window making me arm signs all happy, when I focused thinking what tha, I saw my Mexican partner in crime!!! It was like those moments money can't buy (for everything else pay in cash, don't put yourself on debt). I went inside, we hugged each other girly-happily style (it's awesome to finally run into someone I know) and proceed to gossip (which means I know names with real faces).

Apparently, the lentil soup is the best option when you need a quick fix before the gym. It's really earthy, warm, comforting.  

They have a good variety of salad combinations. All the ingredients seemed fresh. I salivated while looking how they fixed my salad.

The small salad size is plenty, it was cheerful for my stomach to watch that they do not measure the amounts of ingredients (no son cuenta chiles!).  

Watching the line up, the speed, accuracy, smile&vibe of the crew, made me realize that they are succeeding. Maybe giving good portions might be their way to say thanks to their costumers (their small salad fed me 2 times this day). 

My pick so far has been the pear and spinach with feta cheese. They put corn, some tomato, cucumber and feta cheese. I find it filling, refreshing, crunchy and exotic.

I want to taste more of their creations."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! If you work anywhere in the remote area - and even if you don't - this place is superb. The guys are so friendly & the prices are extremely fair. You do not need a large at all, a small lunch special with shawarma is $6.99 & many places would charge at least double this. Just be prepared if it is your first time for a few minutes wait, order on the left (cash only) then queue on the right hand side for service. LOVE IT & wish more places could be like this - thank you guys keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I go here all the time for lunch; I feel fortunate it's so close by. Everything is fresh and the value is tremendous. Chicken shawarma lunch is just massive and has tons of fresh greens and veggies."}
{"text":"The best salad joint in the Bloor and Yonge area with great prices and incredibly massive portions. There is an endless amount of salads to choose from, and all are loaded up very generously with fresh vegetables! This tiny joint gets quite crowded on during the lunch our during the weekdays, so I suggest you going a little earlier to beat the rush. I personally recommend the vegetarian plate. It's tasty, satisfying, and can be made vegan friendly (just without the cheese :) )! It's also important to note that they accept cash only and is not really a dine-in kind of joint. But all in all, a delicious cornucopia of salads at a great price :)"}
{"text":"I'm updating my previous review only to say that they have extended their hours to about 7-8 pm on weekdays. Great for picking something up for dinner without worrying about cooking."}
{"text":"Huge portions of chicken shawarma. Actually the best I've tasted in the city. I don't know if it's the spices,  the freshness or the cooking but it is amazing. 

The portion they give you for the price you pay is ridiculous. Every vegetable you want plus delicious shawarma and sauce. 

Definitely highly recommend. Go for lunch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"At first, I was reluctant to review because I wanted to keep the place to myself. Fat chance.  Get there early (or go late) for lunch because they get line-ups now. As they should.

The food they give you for $6.50 can feed an army. And it's good!

Salads with heaping piles of vegetables. You can add on gyro or chicken or steak (that takes longer). The salad is so big, I sometimes go half-zies with a co-worker or save some for the next day's lunch.

Good falafel too.

Not much seating. More of a take-out place, but you can sit if you need to."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to eat at Yonge and Bloor.  The cost is fair borderline cheap and the portion are huge.  Everything is fresh and I love the fact that they made your order customize to your liking.  This is not a fancy place more like a take out counter but it's an amazing place to grab lunch to go and get on with your day!  Falafel wraps and chicken breast lunch special are my favorites.  This is a gem in the area and all walks of life enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"how good is this place??
it's a small spot, I've passed it a few thousand times, glad i finally tried it.
huge portions, fresh ingredients.
cautious during lunch hour; really busy. 
Prices went up too much this past year, not cheap option anymore...  ALSO; GET A DEBIT MACHINE, this idea that it slows down business is WRONG and STUPID.  Cards are much faster than exchanging cash and getting change.  Owner is a bit of a MORON."}
{"text":"This store is amazing in many ways. 
First off, the location is situated behind the busy bloor and Yonge intersection, so it's quite easy to find. 
Second of all, the ingredients are freshly prepared. The chicken lunch special is arguably my favourite( even though I have not tried other dishes yet lol). The chef(?) cut off the meat from the rotating device and grills it to make it crispy and hot but also extremely juicy at the same time( honestly I would only order the chicken if that was allowed). 
Lastly and maybe the most important element that makes this place one of my fav is their service. EVERYONE IS FRIENDLY. I rmb asking so many questions the first time I was there, and the staff kindly explained all of the options. 
Highly recommend this place and imo it's better than The Halal Guys"}
{"text":"One more great salad bars has been added to my list of \"where to eat around work\" 

chicken shawarma salad for 7.99 (small) 

The guy literally had to sit on the container to close it! My guess about 3 pounds of salad. 

On my way to the office stopped at the Dollarama to get tupperware in order to eat it at my desk without spilling it... I haven't even made a dent in the salad and I'm already stuffed!

Apart from all the fresh ingredients and the hummus that they scoop on the side.. 
The chicken itself was delicious!!! full of flavour and lots of it... my personal favourite some crispy pieces mixed in there. 

LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Great portion and prices! Definitely a must try over most of the places found on Yonge. Quick and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"We came around 4 PM and was wondering if it was still lunch time. The gentleman said it was lunch time all day. 

We ordered the small chicken shawarma and the portions were huge! I like how they were very generous with their portions and they had a lot of fresh salad and vegetable options. It was our first time here and the gentleman gave us free beets with our meal. 

Will definitely come again to try the other meals! 

We had a good lunch and experience"}
{"text":"Unbeatable in terms of price, quantity and quality. I always get their small chicken shawarma lunch and it's packed to the brim with food. At only 8.99 it's literally the healthiest and freshest meal around. Be prepared to have leftovers. One small issue l have is they tend to overcook the chicken sometimes so you can always ask them to cook it for less time."}
{"text":"The best bang for your buck!  If you're looking to spend less than $10 and you're hungry, this is the place to go.  Don't let their name trick you as you get much more than a typical salad.  They always have lunch special and my go-to is the Chicken Shawarma.  Nothing beats salad, chicken, hummus, tzatziki sauce, and their hot sauce to fill up your stomach.  The longs usually are long during lunch time but I've learned to go after to avoid the line ups.  The servers are very nice and generous with their portion servings."}
{"text":"- Extremely generous portions
- Fresh Ingredients
- One of the top lunch spots in the area
- Avoid lunch time rush (1:00pm)
- Tip : Cash and Take away only"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about Salad House, but unfortunately I had been unable to check them out because their hours of operation suck - they are only open Monday to Friday from 11am to 5pm. So I can't stop by after work or on the weekend.

Fortunately for me today, I had the day off and happened to be walking by at 10:50am. I looked in and noticed that they were prepping for the lunch rush. It was freezing out so I was relieved to be allowed to wait inside. The first thing I noticed when I walked in and browsed the menus on the wall is that the prices are different than what other reviewers have quoted. For example, a small shawarma plate is $6.99 not $4.99. Nevertheless, $6.99 is a fair price.

I decided to order a small shawarma plate with no onions. As they were putting my dish together I noticed that they had added chickpeas to my rice and I could see onions in it. I asked if those were onions and was told that yes they were. Then I reminded them that I had asked for no onions. The gentleman serving me looked a bit confused and told me that those were cooked onions. **Sigh. I have never understood why in the food industry cooked onions are considered to be a whole different species from raw onions. Onions are onions! Anyway, the gentleman was really cool about it and although I suggested he use the same container, just remove the chickpeas, he said, \"no no...I will make you a new one. Not to worry. Most people are okay with cooked onions, just not raw onions. But thank you for letting me know.\"  And so he continued to assemble my plate....and it kept growing, and growing...WOW...that was a lot of food! This was a small??!! Finally he struggled a bit closing the container and wished me a good day.

When I got home I opened the container and it was overflowing! In a good way.  To show you the amount of food you get if you order a small plate, I rummaged in my cupboard looking for my biggest plate, and then flipped the container on it - that is why you see a lot of rice on top and little chicken. Believe me, there was  A LOT of chicken!! In fact, there was a lot of everything! And every ingredient was fresh, the chicken was moist and well-seasoned with little fat - big points for that! Most importantly, everything tasted clean, healthy and naturally delicious. $6.99 plus tax is a bargain for the quality and portions you get at Salad House. I am already planning to pick-up lunch from here on my next day off.

Check them out if you are in the areas on a weekday. Grr....crappy crappy hours!"}
{"text":"On days when I want a big and tasty lunch, I opt for this place! The small shawarma is actually massive and the people are really kind. It's super busy so don't get overwhelmed but it's well worth the chaos. Also.. this place only takes cash."}
{"text":"Chicken Shwarama lunch special is the way to go!!

These guys are really generous with portion...literally 5lbs of food as they pack the container until it's filled to the rim! So I'd recommend getting the small, not large. I sometimes eat the small for lunch AND dinner, it is so much food. You may also ask for salad only, no rice for a lighter meal.

Tips: Go early before 12pm to avoid long line-up or go later but not too late because once they sell out of the shwarama, there's no more (~2pm)!"}
{"text":"If you read my review of Pita Land you would have noticed that I suggested going to Salad House instead.  This place is amazing!  The Shawarma is delicious and you get a HUGE amount of food for $10 - make sure you order the small, unless you want leftovers for dinner and tomorrow's breakfast.  

The service is fast and friendly.  The only thing I wish is that the restaurant was bigger as there really isn't any room to sit down and eat; takeout only."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  Everything is super fresh, especially the chicken shawarma.  The people who run it couldn't be nicer, especially the young man Who is there in the afternoons.  Generous portions and very reasonable places make this one of my favorite places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"So ....months later, I'm still obsessed with this place. I get take out at least once a week.

I've found coming around 4-6pm the best time as there is usually no line up and they always have the chicken schwarma ( the run out quite often after the lunch rush and it takes a while for the new one to b ready)!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on Hayden St. near the Yonge & Bloor intersection, Salad House is one of those contestants for hidden gem status. This place has Seinfeld-like feel to it. People line up here during the lunch rush and usually come with someone else to talk to during the long wait. You can be in and out of here in about 10-15 minutes on average, perhaps even longer. But the wait is worth it if you're hungry for a tasty and refreshing salad.

Must-try items:
Chicken Shawarma Salad

I must admit that there are a few obvious flaws about this place which would potentially disappoint some people. But the quality of the salad overrules all of that in my books. I wouldn't come here every day, and definitely not during the lunch hour. They aren't open on weekends, which is another issue. They're extremely small for the size of the crowds that come here, and would benefit from moving into a larger location. But for the value and price, this place is definitely in my top places to get salad in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Yelpers have disappointed me tremendously with this sad excuse of a \"go-to lunch spot\". 

I was very excited to try this place out- it seemed reasonably priced with large portions, and with many accommodating options for all dietary concerns.

We ordered two small vegetarian plates. The cashier emerged from the kitchen and rudely gestured for us to hand over the cash payment immediately. We had questions about the food and she gave sad excuses of answers. Two employees behind the counter began preparing our food. They had terrible communication with one another, which was a terrible way to start our food preparation experience. 

The person preparing my food threw in whatever she pleased. She asked me if I wanted it AFTER she already placed it in the small styrofoam container. 

We took the food to go (no space to eat in the place). The food was awful. The plate had a base of terribly cooked, bland, hot slimy rice. Next was a layer of canned, bland, watery chickpeas and lentils. Complete mush. The rest of the ingredients were completely cold and clashed with the temperature of the rice and legumes. Some veggies were bland, some overly pickled, some cut into disproportionate chunks, and some just flat out inedible. 

The best part of the meal was the plain salad greens (that hadn't touched the warm, watery rice and beans). 

Save your money. Do not come here. I have no idea what people tasted when they came here. How do you mess up a salad?! Go to a salad bar at a grocery store instead- for real."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck in the Yonge and Bloor area for lunch. Don't believe me? Take a look at how insanely rammed this place gets during peak hours between noon and 1. Quite simply, Salad House gives you more food than any human being should eat in one sitting, and at reasonable prices.

I've been eating here since it was the \"Lunch House\". I guess they wanted to promote their salads and appear more health conscious. Doesn't bother me. I can still walk out of here with a brick of food that will ensure no work gets done in the afternoon and often for less than ten bucks.

The shawarma is obviously the biggest draw here. I recommend the \"small\". Maybe it's small if you are 6,7\" and training for a strongman competition. The large lunch specials are better suited to feeding small villages but hey, who am I to judge.

Personally, I got for the gyro lunch special. Each special comes with house salad (peppers, tomatoes, cucumber, onions, lemon vinaigrette and feta) and rice with your choice of lentils or chick peas. They'll also pile on a scoop of hummus, some pickles, tebouleh, and your meat of choice.

Too much? Get a wrap. Or grab a salad. I'm a Cobb man myself. Either way, you get quantity, quality, and value. All hail the king of lunches."}
{"text":"Huge portions, quick and friendly service, fixed prices unlike most salad places. I get the large veggie plate with extra greens instead of rice. Around $10 and will be my lunch and dinner today! 

Note: They take cash only."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. 

Now don't get it twisted, salads are generally healthier for you but with the amount of toppings and extras that Salad House packs into your box, you may as well be eating the same amount of calories as McDonalds. Their lunch special provides an insane amount of value for the price. They often give you extras too if they recognise you which is a nice bonus.

You may be a bit confused if you come here during lunch because there are several lines. Line up on the left first to order and pay and then line up on the right (there may be 2 lines) to give your receipt. If you are still confused, ask! The workers are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I get the chicken shawarma salad often cause I work in the area. Delicious, huge portion and decent priced. The employees are nice too."}
{"text":"I am ECSTATIC that I started coming here!  The girls i work with eat from here all the time and I'm not a huge salad fan, so it took me a while to finally try it but now I come here a few times every week!   They closed for vacation after the holidays last year, and we were counting the days until they were open again!

HUGE portions, and it's cheap fixed prices (as in it's NOT pay-by-weight, like many similar salad places).  There are lots and lots of ingredients to choose from, and everything is prepared very well and is fresh and delicious.  Great cooks, great service, very friendly and personable, generous, cheap prices, everything you want!  

I am pretty picky and they don't mind at all.  The staff is always smiling and helpful.  I love their house signature dressing!  

I WISH WISH WISH they were open on weekends and maybe a little bit later in the day too -- they are Mon-Fri 11am-5pm.  And note they're cash only.

I recommend it to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"If you want something that's healthy, tasty, fresh and a big bang for your buck, you've found the right place! 
I come here at least once every two weeks and get their lunch special or wraps. There are many food options that they serve, wraps, salads, rice, soups.. etc. 

This is relatively close to work, that is another reason why I come here often. 

To avoid line ups, you shouldn't come here during peek hours. I would say the line is next to nothing by 1:30. 

Everything is freshly made every morning. 

It's great and the portions are ridiculous! 

P.S. if you like tuna, I recommend the tuna wrap as well. Make sure you get it with their yummy garlic tzatziki sauce! It's literally come out to be 5 pounds :) 

Side note: The place closes at 5pm, and they take cash only."}
{"text":"Great place for salads and plates! Lunch combo available all day and you can just pick your meat. Everything tastes homemade and the food is fresh. Will be coming back regularly."}
