{"text":"Perfect place for an informal business lunch. Fairly casual but still nice enough for that purpose. Sit inside to avoid the noise of the food court to which it is adjacent.  I have only eaten here once, but it was good enough that if I am back in Toronto for lunch, I would go back. I had the spanikopita (spinach pie). It came with salad and rice. The pie itself was very crisp and flaky phyllo on the outside with a delicious spinach filling. Often times, this dish to spongy or tastes too much like defrosted frozen spinach. That was not the case here. The filling was hot and had the flavor of spinach with just a touch of spice and cheese. The rice and salad were perfectly acceptable, if not particularly interesting. On top of that, the fresh warm bread was a nice addition. Overall, though, for the menu prices and the speed of service, this was a perfectly fine lunch.  My only complaint is that the iced tea was sweetened, but maybe that is a Canadian thing."}
{"text":"pros:  - great location in downtown toronto            - pretty good food  big downside: It's all about the location and is tailored more for business lunches. Nothing here is superior to what you can get around the Danforth area for practically half the price."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  This little restaurant is tucked away in the back of First Canadian Place's upstairs food court.  This restaurant is packed at lunch time and specializes in Greek food. I don't think it's open very late either. Food is \"average\" greek food - food court quality despite the restaurant setting. They are fairly fast and get you in and out quick. I tried the Chicken fillet dinner and chicken souvlaki dinner. Portions are kind of big for lunch. I need a nap after eating here! Prices are good for downtown, each platter is about $12 - $14. If you order a soda, they will bring you the worlds smallest glass. I don't get it, 2-3 sips and your done. Crazy."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick business lunch.  The ATHENIAN SCHNITZEL - is my choice of best entr√©e here.  it includes a lightly breaded chicken breast, rice, and Greek salad.    The bread they place on your side plate is always fresh and tasty.  The decor is a little dated but nicely laid out.  I always request to sit in the back of the restaurant where the noise level drops as this place is very busy at lunchtime with a bit of a line-up.  Either come at 11:45 or wait till 1pm to arrive."}
