{"text":"The food was okay, and for a reunion dinner it seemed like a great place, since the last times we went it was good. Tonight it was not. The service was terrible, we actually had to ask to receive bread (2x), they brought the wrong entree, and then charged for both the correct one and the wrong one. The entire service took 2+ hours. Not impressed. I'm not sure if they were short-staffed, but it will definitely be a while before I chance it again."}
{"text":"Wow, this has to be the cutest restaurant in Toronto! It reminds me of NYC restaurants in West Village. It's a little small (maybe around 12 or 15 tables?), but not crammed. Dark wood and tons of framed pictures and posters make a very intimate setting for small gatherings and good conversations.   Brunch menu is pretty standard, but the quality of food is amazing. I got a Veggie and blue cheese wrap and it was HEAVENLY! Friends got a egg benedict and egg florentine and those were amazing too. The atmosphere was really chill, we sat there for 2 hours and no one rushed us to get the check or anything like that. It was very relaxing and comfortable.  Minus one star for the slightly slow service. They were a little understaffed for a full house. Staff were all very nice and professional though. Will definitely go back for lunch/ dinner again!!"}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant is a little mixed. I first came across Alize a few years ago, when I went there for dinner. The wait staff was not so good, especially for such a small, I guess you could call it cozy restaurant. The menu selection was about what you would expect from a restaurant this size. When the food got to the table it was flavorful and I was satisfied with the overall quality.   Now with all that being said, I went back a few weeks later for their Brunch, which I have to say was FANTASTIC! selection was good and the service was better then what I had experienced last time I ate at Alize.  Hope that helps"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were contact through Yelp and offered free entrées on account of our previous experience at Alize (see below). At the end of our meal we were surprised when they took care of our entire bill (all $110 of it!) We also identified ourselves when we made our reservations so they knew it was us from the start.  I think it is extremely commendable that the restaurant offered to make up for a previous experience. Most just wouldn't care.  With that disclaimer in mind:   The service during this visit was impeccable. Despite the fact the restaurant was packed when we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Throughout the evening we always felt like the most important guests in the restaurant with our food arriving quickly and our servers being careful to make sure we had everything we needed.   The food is very simple and elegant. The ingredients are fresh. The menu is everything you'd expect from a nice Italian restaurant. My only advice would be to skip the Caesar salad, the other salads on the menu are much better.  While we ate our meal we watched Mariam, the owner, making the rounds of the restaurant making sure every table was happy with their experience. She is clearly passionate about what she does and has a real heart for her customers and her business. We couldn't help but overhear a truly genuine conversation between the couple next to us celebrating their 50th anniversary and Mariam. They were telling her how Alize is their favourite restaurant in the area.   I'm giving this an honest 3 star review because for me, this isn't my ideal restaurant. I like restaurants that are a little darker, a little noisier, and foods that are a little more off beat and provide a 'wow' factor.   This place will be lovely in the summer on the patio or even inside since they can open the front right up to let the warm summer breeze blow through.  Alize, thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Failure to communicate is an understatement.  My sister and brother-in-law had made dinner reservations for Sat. pm to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary.  I thought it would be nice to surprise them with a dessert on us.  E-mailed them a message (via their website) asking if they provide any of these niceties for such occassions...no reply.  My husband went in person and spoke with the manager who took his contact info..payment info..and the parties name.  Saturday came and went - nothing was done.  I called Sunday, left my name/phone and was told the manager would call me back - still waiting and it's Tuesday pm.  The person I spoke to on the phone even remembers my husband coming in asking about setting this up.  I sent another e-mail asking what may have happened...no reply.  My sister was able to speak to the manager today and apparently the manager 'left a message at the contact number\" - no there wasn't....also there was confusion as to the recipient's name on the list so she was hoping her staff would somehow know which couple would be celebrating an anniversary and figure out who is to get the dessert.    Even though I have not eaten here myself, I will not do so in the future.  There is, no doubt. room for improvement at this establishment."}
{"text":"**1/2 stars  I had purchased a Groupon for a 4-person prix fixe menu for $120.  The menu was as follows: 2 x Onion Soup and Crispy Parmesan Gratin 2 x Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce 2 x Atlantic Salmon on Linguine 2 x Duck Confit with Wild-Mushroom Risotto Dessert platter for the table Coffee/Tea  There were a total of 6 of us, and the other 2 ordered off their weekly Prix Fixe menu for $25 which includes an appetizer and entrée.  All items marked with an asterix on the menu were available options.  From the dinner prix fixe menu, we opted for the onion soup, and the organic greens.  For mains, the Beef Bourgignon and 8 oz. New York Striploin were selected.  We also ordered 2 glasses of wine, a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.  I am not a fan of red wines to begin with, but I found the Cabernet to be too sour for my taste buds.  The Merlot was much more subtle.  Upon ordering, we were brought 2 warm bread baskets.  Those of you who know me know how excited I get when I am served warm bread, or how bratty I get when I am served cold bread :p  It was a poppy seed bread served with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil.  From what I gather, it is a store-bought bread and not bought daily as the bread, though I won't say stale was not the freshest. The French Onion Soup was disappointing to say the least.  The lack of deep onion flavour and gooey cheese coupled with a little too much wine in the broth made for a rather sour taste.  More cheese and more onions = more flavour.  The math is quite easy folks!  The only part of this dish that was tasty was the crostini. The Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce was served almost cold which was indicative that it had been waiting for awhile since the chef prepared it to reach our table.  The calamari was nicely grilled, soft and tender but unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked.  The salad came adorned with olives and a balsamic drizzle.  Overall, this dish was all one flavour - tart, mostly stemming from vinaigrette and tomatoes.  It would've been nice for some contrast.The Salmon Linguine was made with a simple sauce which really brought out the flavour of the fish.  The salmon for me was the best part as the skin was crispy and the fish was flaky.  The linguine was rather bland, with a lemon-oil drizzle.  So you can imagine how excited I was when the server brought over the Parmesan cheese for sprinkling!The Duck Confit came with your choice of sauce: veal jus, orange jus, or blueberry jus. We opted for the veal and orange jus.  The duck had a nice crisp skin, but it was more of a crust than anything else.  It resembled the texture of a chicken wing that's been sitting on the grill a little too long.  The risotto was barely warm and a bit dry.  The side vegetables were tender and savoury.  I also got to sample both the sirloin and the beef bourgignon.  The steak was quite flavourful and had a nice charred flavour to it.  Taste was all there, but texturally, it was a tad on the dry side.  The frites were amazing!  I love crispy fries.  Ketchup wasn't even on my mind when I was chowing these down.  That must be a sure sign that they were tasty?  I found the red wine in the beef bourgignon to be overpowering, but my mom thought it was fine.  My only \"beef\" about this dish is that I wish the meat were more tender.The Groupon specified that a dessert tray would be served. The serving size was more suitable for a party of 2 than it was for a party of 4.  It consisted of a Crème Brûlée, Blueberry Strudel and Raspberry Sorbet with blueberries, gooseberries and raspberries for garnish.  I was unimpressed with their  crème brûlée which was grainy and not velvety smooth.  The raspberry sorbet was quite refreshing.  The strudel was more what I would call a dessert spring roll and had a crisp exterior and yummy filling!  The house coffee was also quite good.  My parents, who you have never applauded any restaurant for good coffee finally cracked and awarded their first ever java compliment.  Verdict:  I haven't experienced service like this in a very long time.  The servers were very attentive, courteous and sported a smile.  Food-wise I was a little disappointed but it wasn't terrible.  It someone were to ask for recommendations, Alizé wouldn't be on the top of the list but if I were in the area I may eat here again... Perhaps ordering off their regular menu would serve as a better basis of comparison.  Until then, I reserve judgment."}
{"text":"Came here after a great walk, which meant we were hungry and thirsty.   We started off with fresh squeezed orange juice and some coffee.  Service was great and it wasn't crowded.  I had the eggs benedict.  I've never had them with mushrooms before.  It was great.  They did forget to put my holandaise sauce on the side (I must have offended the chef for asking) but I managed to scrape it off.  The potatoes and salad that came with it were also great.  A great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"So we had a deal find coupon for this restaurant and so I invited my bestfriend, a goodfriend to join me for a \"good time\".   We arrive and they have given away our table because we were 10 mins late, even though I called them letting them know I will be exactly 10 minutes and they said not a problem?!?!?  So we get put at the last table at the place right by the cold window and front door :s it is a pretty small place 10-12 tables, so it was freezing there.  So we sit down and produce our voucher, which I put in my reservations with them on open table for a table of 3 people with a voucher. The server (with glasses) then proceeds to tell me they can't honor the voucher because it says 1 coupon for a table of four or 2 vouchers for tables 5 and more. I got mad at this point because that is why they have a \"note\" section on open table so you can provide extra info/requests that they are spose to look at. Wtf, he says this and then walks away as if expecting us to leave by ourselves wtf.   No we are not incapable of paying full price but when you make your customers feel like it is their fault they didn't review their own reservations and the coupon is stupid, first time ever at any restaurant.   So we end uP staying cuz my bestfriend's boyfriend was able to come join us *thsss lol   So after we order our apptetizer (mussels) and entrees we wait about half an hour before our appetizer arrives, then another 45 minutes for our entrees! By the time we got our entree it was a full 1 1/2 hour after sitting down.  And while we were waiting my friend was hungry so we asked for more bread, the server came and didn't say anything and picked up the bread basket, then came back and plopped it back down! Are you kidding m?  So at this point doesn't matter how our food taste, the experience was ruined :(  Also it looks bad on me because I was the one who told my friends this place was amazing, obviously that changed!  Finally the food: caesar salad- $8 was bad in size but didn't taste it so can't comment! Mussels $7 (we ended up getting charged $9 wtf) there was 2 two bad mussels that tasted like rotten seafood! Beef dish $18 had a lot of veggies with good variety and little beef but it tasted good! The chicken ravioli came with 4 pieces and a good amount of chicken! Fair to say my guy friend was not full at all but it did taste good! I had the seafood linguine $18 which was good but also a bit salty and again one bad mussel :s for a place that has a ayce mussel nights this is pretty bad! Didn't order dessert and tipped them 12% tip and walked out knowing we would never return! Overall bad experience! :("}
{"text":"Been here a few times  and polite staff With good service. Lovely British waitress worth a return trip Food is ok and since I go for brunch and may linger and read, not a problem. Very quiet Place too  atmosphere pleasant Food is ok. Can't say spectacular though Enjoy!  Foodnote: Sadly, the place went out of business shortly after I drafted this review. Balilff notice on door: :("}
{"text":"I came here for a Winterlicious lunch yesterday with a group of friends. Not knowing what to expect, since although I've heard great things about Alize in general, usually the winter/summerlicious events seem to be a mediocre sampling into what you can usually expect from the  menu.  I made a reservation for 5 people a week earlier, and when we made it at the exact time specified, we were told to wait in the cold doorway till they prepared the tables. We waited for about 10-15 minutes, and the restaurant itself wasn't very busy yet.   The menu options were diverse and more than acceptable with 3-4 per course. I had the Potato and Leek Soup, Barbequed Salmon and Tiramisu. One of my friends thought the crepe was distinctly too dry.   The Potato soup and Tiramisu were both very mediocre, and my biggest shocker of the night was finding a strand of black hair intertwined in my friend's entree(bbq'ed salmon). When she alerted the server, all she got was a very quiet apology, the plate was taken away and replaced.   That's it.   We were all left gagging for several minutes at a shocker that should have never taken place in a restaurant, much less one like Alize. Worse still, to have a similar situation addressed by the restaurant as though the salmon was just simply overcooked.   That would have been acceptable. Hair in food, is not.   Further, the friend and I (had the exact same choices) have been experiencing stomach trouble since last night. I suspect the salmon. It's a shame, because the restaurant itself is so cute."}
{"text":"Day of the week: Thursday Time: ~18:00 EST  I made an OpenTable reservation with my friend for 5:30 PM; my friend was running late, so I got to push the reservations until 6:00 PM.  When I entered the restaurant, the server knew right away that I was the one that made the reservation and quickly sat us.  The waiters and waitress was absolutely awesome.  They quickly brought us water and told us about the specials that they had that day.  I ordered the seafood fettucine and my frien had the prix-fixe menu (salad, 8 oz. steak, and chocolate cake for $25).  The fettucine was superb: surprisingly quite a lot of seafood and sauce in the noodles.    I also ordered a white chocolate, blueberry strudel for dessert.  I enjoyed how the tangy taste of the bluberries compimented the white chocolate; however, sometimes, the white chocolate overpowered the blueberries and got a tad too sweet.  Ambiance was great.  Small little restaurant, but I loved it.  Wasn't really feeling for an eclectic, large restaurant; so this was absolutely perfect.  Overall though, great experience at Alize.  Will defintiely come back again!"}
{"text":"Hoorah! Yelp Review #100!! And I crossed a boarder to get it!   Well, maybe I didn't cross it specifically to be my #100, but I'm in Toronto and it happened to be my #100. Now, I was worried that my excitement regarding this restaurant may have been biased. I was REALLY excited that this place was going to be the big triple digit review. However, this place was pretty fantastic.   The ambiance here is great. Just enough tables to feel like it could be crowded, but not too many to were it loses its intimacy. Great long padded bench with tables spread out along it and some individual tables  as well. A cute little outside area (but only 2 person tables can fit...it is teany tiny!). Nice well decor, lighting, music. Cute bar with tons of wine options (or at least enough to make me happy).   Food was pretty great too. The bread was hot and toasted just right and served with olive oil and balsamic. My pasta with sausage was great and my friend enjoyed her mussels. However, it was the frites that came along with the mussels that were pretty damn delicious. Great salty flavor with what seemed like a hint of parmesan and spice. Finish off with a perfect sized tiramisu and you'll be pleasantly satisfied.   My sangria was great, but I don't claim to be a sangria expert (one of my favorite sangria's is made with Mad Dog 20-20...I love Dominik's!). Very fruity and I loved it.   A couple of fun facts: All you can eat mussels Mon-Thu; They have a second location apparently but I have no clue where it is; It's been around for about 8 years (per our waiter, who was very nice) and is a local favorite; packed on weekends and they don't take reservations between 7pm-8pm on weekends; they also have a prix fixe menu for $25 (appetizer, main course, and dessert) .  Honestly, this place would be great for a casual dinner with friends or even for a date. I really enjoyed it and the food was faboo (yahoo!)  Happy #100 Yelp!"}
