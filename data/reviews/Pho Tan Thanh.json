{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food hidden away in a Grocery store. Be sure to explore the menu. Start with some Pho (try out the real pronunciation - 'Fuh'), with BBQ pork or fish ball (oh yeah, I said fish ball, yum). Then move on to some DIY food prep with the apps you build yourself. Rice paper you moisten slightly, then stuff to make your own Spring Rolls (get the beef wrapped in grape leaves, beyond tasty). Great place, great food. Go shopping after you are done..."}
{"text":"I've been visiting here for two years now, always order their beef stew noodle soap, it taste awesome! The staff are very friendly, the price is very cheap compare to other pho restaurants in Arizona. Will come back soon"}
{"text":"Friend took me here for lunch today - treated me as it is my birthday - YAY. The food was just okay, with an unpleasant surprise. Our initial order was taken quickly. We ordered a couple spring rolls - pretty standard rice paper wrapper with shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and lettuce inside along with a hoisin dip. It also included a dead baby fly inside one of the rolls...GROSS. Maybe because it's my birthday, I didn't even get upset over it. I just moved on (didn't even tell my friend). I thought \"Okay, maybe it was in the lettuce and it just didn't get rinsed out enough...\" I stopped eating that roll and checked the inside of the other, fly free. We also ordered some kind of stir fry with various seafood and veggies. That was okay. My friend was still hungry, so he ordered a bowl of congee, which was kinda blah. The real reason I'm giving this place 1 star is for the dismal service we received. Nick V. is spot-on about the rude and slow service. While our initial order was taken quickly, when the food came out it was also dropped at the edge of our table and the server left without looking at us. It took several \"Excuse me please\" along with hand raising from my friend to get an extra plate so he could share his food with me. When he told one individual he wanted to order something more, there was an actual eye-roll! The menu was extended, then tossed onto a nearby table when my friend ordered his congee. When it came out, a young Asian girl brought it out, shoved it on the table, and when my friend said, \"May we have some spoons and an extra bowl so we can eat it,\" the girl literally stared right at his face with absolutely NO emotion for a good moment. Then grabbed a couple spoons from another table and tossed them on our table. Really? Nick V., please don't assume it's a cultural thing. Both my friend and I are Asian, and we were appalled at the behavior. It was so bad, it was actually funny, in a sad, pathetic way. I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. I also agree that Pho Avina has EXTREMELY nice owners and servers, along with great food, and THEY will have my continued patronage."}
{"text":"I love that this place is inside the LeeLee. I can get a bite to eat before I go shopping.   I never had Vietnamese before going here so I can't really compare it to anything. All I can say is what I've had there has all been very good. I especially love the spring rolls. The prices are very reasonable. I've been there a few times now and always see the same people working there so I'm guessing it's a owned by a small family. I'm all about supporting small business!  The only not-so-great thing I've run into there is that they have a couple of duck dishes on their menu but every time we've been there, they don't have duck. Which is a little odd to me because LeeLee sells whole duck (at a reasonable price too!). I don't understand why they have it on the menu if they're not actually going to have it available.   But that small confusion aside, I've found it a decent place to grab a bite to eat that isn't deep-fat-fried and swimming in sugar. For the sugar, I suggest you go to the teashop right next door (also in LeeLee) and grab one of their fruit smoothie boba teas. Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese place on this side of town. Their Pho ga is soooooo good, way better than others I've tried in town. It has this extra spice to it that makes it absolutely delicious. Their pho dac biet is great as well but da vang beats it.   This place is relatively clean, located inside lee lees, the staff is friendly and attentive for not knowing much English.  Getting two pho dishea, spring roll and egg roll runs you less than $20 bucks and a big belly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for Pho. The spring rolls are fresh and taste amazing and the broth for the Pho is very flavorful. My nail lady told me to ask for my Pho with yellow noodles and now when I go I can't decide which way I want it because they are both so good. The location is inside Lee Lee's market. I eat here once a week for lunch and would recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"very poor service, I order 3 time, 3 food order togo in the month, everytime I brought the food home, I open up they give me wrong item, three time in the row, can not believe that. very very poor service."}
{"text":"I've just found out about this place a week ago, and so far it's pretty awesome Vietnamese food. I've actually been eating here for the past 4 days. Everyday for dinner. Their seasoning is very palatable to the taste. And priced very reasonable, actually very cheap! I've had the pho, chao long, Banh xeo, com ga nuong, Bo nuong la nho, mi Sui Cao, bun bo hue and they are all very delicious! I don't know about the reviewer saying that the Banh xeo( Vietnamese crepes) was yuck, he probably never had it before and don't know what it's SUPPOSED to taste like, and making a review of something he doesn't know anything about. But their Banh xeo is actually very good. It's crispy, which is hard to accomplish, and has all the fillings balanced. You're supposed to dip it into the nuoc Cham to get all the flavors out of the dish. I'm Vietnamese and a very picky eater, and this restaurant serves really good home cooked Vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, this pho is pretty good! Got #1.. And for $6! Nice. Had a decent amount of meat and noodles. Broth was tasty as well. Also tried the egg rolls (which I know to be spring rolls in the east) which was different than the ones I'm used to but delish.  Price point is good. Food was good. Service was okay. Would come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is sucks for timing or they are racially profiling white people with tattoos."}
{"text":"Great place in peoria for good vietnamese food. Cheap n fast service."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic and the price is low. I had Pho Dac Biet and Goi Cuon Thit Tom; the bill came out to be less than $10. Really wish the place open late for late night craving but unfortunately they close at 9:00pm."}
{"text":"Yum! We were passing through Phoenix and stopped here on Christmas day. The pho broth is delicious. We had spring rolls (tofu was fresh fried and tasty), one #16 and one #121 - the beef pho was definitely the way to go. The tofu pho still had delicious broth and tasty noodles, but the tofu was cold and just plopped in there without cooking it. The service was curt and the ambiance isn't great, but you don't expect that for a $5 pho place in a dumpy strip mall. Would recommend for good pho."}
{"text":"I come to this place once a week at least. 2B is my favorite. Conveniently placed and priced right=)"}
{"text":"Love the food here, we come at least once a week. The food def gets 5 stars. the only reason for 4 stars is their customer service could be better. The drink refilling is a must!!!!"}
{"text":"I-wub-you-glad-you-reopened-but-why-so-far-from-East-Valley-I-wub-you.  And breathe.  Yes for all the reasons why everyone already says it's so good, and they"}
{"text":"If you a quick bite before picking up some groceries at lee lee, Pho Tan Thanh is the place to be - relatively cheap and quick, owners are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Idk I always come here and like it. The owner is nice. The foods good. Service is fast. My to go order spilled and they kindly gave me another."}
{"text":"Closes early before 9pm and not open at all at times. Dive far and get there and the place is closed early :("}
{"text":"Good and cheap and next to asian food market. They give u rice paper and u make your own spring roll."}
{"text":"Super affordable and great tasting and always healthy.  I can't believe a huge bowl of pho with ribeye and meatballs, plus all the rice noodles, onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, lemon and clear beef broth is only around six dollars.  Two large shrimp and pork springs rolls with peanut or fish sauce is only $2.50!  Great food and a bargain in a massive warehouse of Asian and European foods."}
{"text":"Yikes, dirty. Funny taste to the Pho and spring rolls I tried. No peanut sauce either. The pricing was very reasonable and the menu is huge. Service was awful , I waited for ever. ....But I can't shake the taste in my mouth. It was metallic and the pork tasted old. I couldn't finish it for fear of food poisoning. I walked out into the grocery store part. Very glad I did. They had BoBa that was very good and saved the whole experience. On the way out  of Lee Lee's I tried pancakes they were making ,most excellent."}
{"text":"Rich, robust pho and priced right, too! When I got my nails done last year, I asked my Vietnamese manicurist where she would get pho in Phoenix. \"Lee Lee's, of course!\" Pho Tan Thanh is the restaurant located in Lee Lee's asian supermarket. The pho is well season and deep in flavor. All bowls are priced at ($5.50). They also have an upsized version. We love the barbecue pork with crab cake (Number 43 on the menu; $6.50) as well. My son loves the shredded pork that they serve with this rice dish. Tonight, I tried the Vietnamese stew with french bread or the Ban Mi Bo Kho ($5.50). This stew has the same delicious pho base. Although it is thinner than its western counterpart, this soupy stew is savory and fantastic over rice or noodles or with the warm loaf of french bread that they served up. The ambiance reminds me of coffee houses or eateries in South-east Asia. It is always busy with Asian customers of all ages. It is a hole in the wall that is a hidden treasure for foodies."}
{"text":"Always satisfied here. Best prices pho in town, service on point and food is always delicious! I order the huge combination pho bowl usually but today I have an upset tummy so the 3B will do which is just meatball pho. Veggies are always fresh and soup hot, spring rolls are amazing as well. Inside a Asian market so you can shop after"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab something quick and authentic to eat. Everything I've ordered has always been good for the price. You can't beat their prices and their service has always been good when we have dined in."}
{"text":"I want to give this place four stars because I know how hard the family works and how friendly they can be... but there were too many negative factors that leaned more towards three stars.   Beginning with the tables -- sticky and oily! Felt the table sticking to my arms. I didn't let this ruin my dining experience (huge germaphobe). Waters and menus were brought to the table and the gentleman serving us didn't give us a chance to look over the menu before asking \"ready to order?\". We didn't want him to have to walk away and come back so we quickly ordered. Gio Cuon (Spring Roll appetizer), Mi Xao Don (crispy stir fry noodles) and Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef rice noodle soup).   This place legit will be jammed packed with crowds, tables full of people and they will have your entire order out within ten minutes of ordering. It's amazing how quickly they prepare the food here.  Our food arrived to the table and they brought two of the correct dishes and one incorrect item. Instead of the spicy beef noodle soup, I got thick stir fried noodles. I told the gentleman it wasn't what I ordered and he explained that the server who took my order was still new and had not learned the entire menu. Ah that explains everything. I chose not to be complicated and kept the dish they brought out to me. No regrets.   I mean, for about $6-7 a plate, you get a reasonably sized portion and it's pretty good. Not the best Vietnamese food in the valley but still tasty.   Young lady who works here was wearing tiny shorts. Not a problem with me, I think anyone should wear what they want. The issue was that she kept tugging at her shorts to pull them down and touching food. Not happy with that at all.   I truly hope to see this place improve because they are hard working people and they deserve the business."}
{"text":"We frequent this pho spot every time we are in AZ (which is a lot). Gotta say for the price it is a pretty good deal. We started coming here after our previous pho spot started skimping on the food they put in the pho. That definitely isn't an issue here, the pho is filling and full of meat, noodles and great broth. The egg rolls and spring rolls are fresh and hot as well.    This is a go-to spot for delicious pho!"}
{"text":"They close at 8pm not 9pm they place will close earlier sometimes too very sad. I don't know if they don't like kids but we got there at 7:30pm and they said they are closing so Togo orders only. I felt that it was because I had a baby with me sleeping."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Pho is always oily, unless you order take out. It's not bad, it's just too oily. Less portion & less meats."}
{"text":"I love their tai tea and spring rolls and it's really not expensive this is a place to go if you are hungry"}
{"text":"Breakfast for people who know what breakfast is.   #26--Bun Rieu: which the menu describes as Rice stick noodles with special shrimp paste soup. It comes with   shrimp pork pork hock tomato and these cuts of coagulated blood strips of meat that taste like nickels mixed with liver.   All I can tell you is that it's awesome.   MmMmm!   The only thing I'm disappointed about here is they have a absolutely ginormic stock pot, like I'm talking Cold War Era big. This pot was so big it had a high dive and a lifeguard on duty.   And it was FULL of soup.   *Wife: holy god... could you cook a whole cow in that?   *Gris: ( standing in awe & majesty of the soup pot ) ...yeah...  Reader, have you ever just seen something and instantly knew what you had to do? Like the universe was calling to you?   I have, I heard it loud and clear.   The last 24 hours are a haze scintillating lights, saline drips & voices warbling from beneath waves of consciousness  (Rosetta Stoned) , but I can say my skin has never been softer or more tan & I taste delicioussss.   Also I have been reliably informed by Uniformed officers, men with guns, and some tightly mannered, heavily tattooed gentlemen, that MIGHT or might not have been the Yakuza, that I am not allowed to get within 50 feet from the pot. Under no circumstances. Again. Ever.   Seriously how do you get a restraining order from a pot of soup."}
{"text":"Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My \"large\" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the \"fresh\" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.  This place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.  I wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"Husband and I come here all the time! I give it 4 stars because of the decor but the food and price is always great. There really isn't a pho place around that will serve you good pho for this cheap. We love it. Service is very fast too. It's more of a \"quick stop to eat\" kind of place not anything fancy."}
{"text":"The food is savory but I'm just not satisfied with their portions. And the service is not great neither."}
{"text":"For sure this is the LEAST EXPENSIVE Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to and I liked some things much better than other things here so it's very hard to give a correct rating and three stars is still a positive rating.   By far my favorite thing to recommend that I tried is the Bo Nuong La Nho is basically seasoned barbecued Ground Beef wrapped in grape leaves served with  rice paper, vegetables, and fish sauce. This was among my favorite Vietnamese appetizers I've ever had. and was truly good. You do need to roll the rice paper yourself with the stuffed grape leaf, herbs and vegetables and then dip in the fish sauce. I really liked this dish and would come back for that.  I had the chicken pho and I did taste my husband's beef pho. After tasting them both I have to say the beef pho with brisket is the way to go here because the brisket was very good and the beef stock was better than the chicken stock but the rare beef in that pho turned to over cooked dry beef as the chicken breast also turned over cooked and dry in the chicken pho.  We did receive a generous amount of Thai basil, limes and jalapenos to use with all the sauces on the table.  I am aware that chicken pho isn't prepared the way that beef pho is with the charred onions and ginger for flavor but the chicken pho that I tried was a generous portion of bland watery stock with dry chicken breast and really is the reason for the three star rating.   Service was good and efficient.  If you are in need of a restroom you need to use the Lee Lee's Market restroom and it was very unpleasant.   YOU DON'T\"T WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SAW!"}
{"text":"So I've been here quite a few times. To be honest it is just average to me compared to the other pho restaurants I have been to. I do have to say though they have improved a lot. The last time I remember coming was about a year ago. The flavors got better. The one cool thing about this place is they have a bunch of different boba drinks and they offer some good flavors. Of course they also have Thai tea which is forever my favorite. It's a decent sized restaurant. Never too noisy to hear others around you. The service is good here as well. I would come back here and try again. The prices and bowl sizes are decent too. I'll have to come back to give a more updated review since it has been a long time for me since I have been here. I still always say about all places, If you haven't been here you should try it."}
{"text":"The food here is cheap and decent amount of portions. But what they lack is customer service and a genuine one at that. I don't know if it's the Asian culture, but they don't really acknowledge you here after leaving food or refilling the water. A smile or a \"You're welcome\" would be a start but they don't do that here. They almost failed my refill drink test where I was out of water and they didn't refill the water till I complained. You guys serve the people with food and service as this area of the business/restaurant REQUIRES it, or don't serve anyone at all."}
{"text":"Had their spring rolls, they were room temperature like they werent stored in a fridge..?   But their pho is amazing, their fried rice tasted good but was cold as well...  The food comes out fast so i feel like they just make everything in advance and give it tothe customers /: sucks cuz i really liked this place"}
{"text":"It's good!  It still needs work.  Their spring rolls could be better, it's done amateurishly."}
{"text":"I came in here because my chef of a hubby was taking too long grocery shopping finding ingredients for a tough recipe. What a great way to kill time for 20 minutes!   I ordered the first thing on the menu, combination pho. It had the tripe, tendons, Beef, meatballs. The broth was really good! I added oodles of Sriracha and hoisin so not sure if that had anything to do with it. It didn't blow my mind away but I enjoyed the food. Although when you're hungry, everything seems to be super good so I may have to do a re-do!  The atmosphere itself is not too exciting but that's to be expected inside of a grocery store. There's no hostess area so I wandered around until I found the manager and he happily let me pick any of the booths to sit in. Service was friendly and prompt. Food was cheap too!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the price. It's one of the cheaper Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. It's the first time I've been here since going to there original location back in Mesa. I kind of miss there picture menu they had at Mesa. There was a dish I use to always order that had a picture before it was a rice dish with some type of grilled links but it's hard to remember without any pictures.   I ended up getting there Grape leaves wrapped over meat dish and opted for rice instead of noodles. It was decent for the price.  Ok so the only thing that really bothered me about this place was there cleanliness. I think having a clean restaurant makes the food easier to swallow. I had a really hard time doing that as I look around while eating.  Maybe next time I will order to go and eat at home.   Overall decent food for the price!"}
{"text":"Coming from Northern California, I longed for the type of \"Pho\" that a few \"hybrid\" restaurants served up - a combination of pho and a wonderful Chinese broth, the base of which is pork grind. Difficult to find here but Pho Tan Thanh serves it up in grand style. #18 on the menu.  Absolutely superb and I look forward to it every Sunday as a treat prior to buying my Chinese broccoli at LeeLee adjacent to the restaurant.   I find the service to be excellent and friendly and highly recommend, especially if you order the # 18! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my place baby! Best mutha@@@&\"& pho hands down!!! Great food and true viet food coming from a true viet brother!!! Dude gives great customer service and doesn't even know English!! How!!! Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Always a convenient when you can have your one of your fave foods first then shop to stock your Asian food needs. This place is definitely my second favorite Vietnamese in the valley, but their bun bo hue is a lot better than at my most fave place. Very quick service, great food and inside Lee Lee Asian store, this place is a win win and always a great choice to satisfy your craving for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"We really like their pho here.  Shrimp fresh rolls are big and delicious.  Friendly staff and quick service.  The grocery store is huge and has a wonderful selection of fresh produce, meats, fish, etc."}
{"text":"Was surprised it is conveniently situated in the market place. The service was quick and courteous. The serving is great for the price. Give this hidden gem a try, while you shop for foreign food!"}
{"text":"Inside Lee Lee's Supermarket so it was definitely convenient. It's cheap and tastes decent. You can really taste the cinnamon in the broth. Service was good and the food came out literally less than 5 minutes after order but it was a rainy weekend afternoon so there wasn't many people eating there at that moment. I wouldn't go out of my way for this place as I live near a gazillion pho places and this one is far west but would definitely eat here if I was nearby."}
{"text":"The Pho here is mediocre. Price should be adjusted lower due to the portions. The broth was somewhat tasty but not unique. For the price and size, I'd rather go to Da Vang. Service was weird, had a guy who walked around not checking up on us looking like he was tuff stuff but easily ignorable.   J out."}
{"text":"We ordered the Bun Tha Nun, Tha Nun with rice, and fried egg rolls.  The food was mediocre but the service was AWFUL!  The young female staff does speak or acknowledge you at all.  I asked her a few times and she just stares at you & leave.  The prego lady staff is just rude.  And male staff was slow and unhelpful.  To top it off my mom and I both got really bad stomach craps the next day and it last 2 days.  I think we had food poisoning."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Pho and shrimp fried rice are amazing. The only reason I am not giving it 5* is because it isnt always the cleanest."}
{"text":"While this isn't my first recommend pho place, I would say this is probably my second.   I like that this spot is pretty convenient and that it's not too far away from my place. The prices are decent and the food comes out quick.   You won't get A+ service here like most pho establishments anyway such as no checking up on you and hardly any water refills, you'll have to wave someone down. The pho itself though, is good.   My friend and I will leave with a bowl of pho each and a side of spring rolls for around $15. Not too bad for a meal for two if you think about it that way."}
{"text":"This place has great Vietnamese food and the price is ridiculously cheap compared to other Vietnamese restaurants where the pho is doubled priced. Great savings and I can shop at Lee Lees market afterwards."}
{"text":"If you want a cheap and good Vietnamese dinner, come here. Their entrees are about $6 or $7 each. The portions are pretty good sized. I tried a little bit of pho, bun bo hue, banh xeo, Hu tieu Dac biet, and Hu tieu xao. They were all delicious. My family told me that they always come here when they are lazy to make dinners."}
{"text":"Just okay.  My fiance and I were shopping in the neighborhood so we decided to give it a try since there are so many good reviews.  I ordered number 1 pho dac and she got 2A pho tai bo vien.  We also wanted the egg rolls but the lady forgot to place our order.     The phos came and they looked okay.  The brisket in my soup was pretty good.  Nice flavor to them.  I was disappointed with the broth though.  It was more of a sweet broth.  It wasn't bad.  But it wasn't great.    Overall, just mediocre pho.  There are definitely better places to go."}
{"text":"I've been looking for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant to eat regularly at since moving to the Valley.  I'm used to eating Pho in Southern California, Philadelphia and Houston, TX so I have tried pretty much every Pho restaurant in the Phoenix area to see which comes close.  This place out of all the places I tried (Pho Avina, King Eggroll, Little Saigon, Pho Than, Un-Phogettable, Pho Binh Minh, 43rd Express, Pho Nhat, Pho Saigon and Pho 68) came the closest to what I have eaten in Westminster (arguably the best city for Pho outside of Vietnam) in AZ.  Ordered the Spring Rolls, Banh Mi and Bun Bo Hue while my girlfriend ordered the Egg Rolls and Beef Pho, and we both ordered the Cafe Sua with our meals.  The broth was both clear and very robust with flavor, with only a slight tinge of sweetness.  The waiter was brought out the fatty broth when requested on the side (one of the few Pho places here that does it, out in CA it is standard) and the red pepper paste tasted freshly made instead of the packaged kind you find in the store.  Not only was the food plentiful (we got a quick and free refill of the condiments/soybean sprouts), but with everything my girlfriend and I ordered, the total bill only came out to $23 total w/ tax.  This is my go-to spot for Pho in the Valley after countless trial and error and a whole-hearted recommended for anyone who loves Vietnamese cuisine as much as we do.  And the service was exemplary.  The owner/waiter was constantly attending to our table without being asked (even though we went during a full peak hour), which is very unlike most Vietnamese restaurant service (where they take your order and then ignore you until you pay the bill).  In terms of quality AND quantity of food, service and price, this is hands down the best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Love it! Fast. Fresh. Cheap. I'll definitely be back! I got spring rolls and pho. Loved the mint in the spring roll too :)"}
{"text":"It's ok. Not my first pick for Vietnamese food. Sadly this place left a lot to be desired. It's not your cleanness/ friendliest restaurant. Food was mediocre but fast. It's nothing worth day dreaming at the office hoping to go back to. It gets the job done. Lol. Cheap and affordable this place would be great for student budgets for sure!!"}
{"text":"This a great place located inside Lee Lee's Market. The guy that I always see when I go in there is usually the same one every time. He is very friendly and I enjoy their food and prices. Their Pho is good, always sooouper hot, (pun intended, lol) always fresh items to add. I guess they have the advantage being in a market to always have fresh greens and ingredients from there. I like their pork spring rolls alot, no noodles inside, yaaay! Their spring rolls are a steal at only $2.50 for two. They are on the smaller side but great and I have always had to wait for them to make them instead of being pre-made.   The only negatives is the parking sucks, restaurant is dingy and set up really odd. Also, they do not wrap their rolls to go with saran wrap separating the two. So when you unroll them, since they make them fresh, they sometimes stick together causing the rice paper to tear open the side of the roll losing some contents...Ugh!"}
{"text":"I came to this place before, it was ok though. Went back again with my mom because we're at Lee supermarket so I thought we could pay a visit and have a quick-Vietnamese breakfast. I ordered 2 orders of Spring Roll and my mom ordered a Pho tai. My spring roll came up fast, first impression: it was ice cold (I know spring rolls are not suppose be hot but it just too cold). They gave us Hoisin sauce for the spring roll, A FREAKING HOISIN SAUCE. I asked the server for peanut sauce and he said that is the peanut sauce..Hello? Do you guys think I can't distinguish between peanut sauce and Hoisin sauce? Then I tried a little of my mom's pho, the broth was terrible, tasted like chowder imo. I'm not intent to attack this place or something. Back in my place, I've eaten every corner of Saigon, some places are really old, but I can feel the cooker's passion in the food I taste. Show some love in what you do if you want your customer to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Really good eggrolls. pho sucks! Not hot enough it came out warm and not enough flavor. I will only come back for the eggrolls."}
{"text":"New pho spot in Lee Lee market is much more than pho. Rice and noodle dishes are as good as ever, but the main attraction is the grilled food and the roll your own spring rolls with a grill at the table! Amazing, while your shopping and hungry, stop in."}
{"text":"They have authentic Vietnamese dishes that aren't usually served elsewhere, like banh canh (Vietnamese Udon) and canh chua (Vietnamese Tamarind Soup). Their bun bo hue (Beef noodles soup) is also authentic and doesn't skip the pork blood and hock like some of the newer pho places are doing. All in all, I've always had a good experience here and it's super convenient that it's located inside of Lee Lee."}
{"text":"Service was good, but pho wasn't hot enough and just warm. The egg rolls that were ordered barely had any flavor to it. Overall, the place was just okay. I thought it tasted better when it first opened up."}
{"text":"I have 3 Pho spots here in Arizona and this one is my second go to on my list.  This place is inside of Lee Lee market and is directly to your left.  They are closed on a random midweek day which kinda sucks but you can't complain that's why you have more than one Pho place.  It's a sit yourself restaurant and don't expect to be greeted so kindly :) that's just the culture.  I always go here with my friend for late dinner or early lunch. The food is fast and it's fresh! We always order the chicken Pho and a plate of spring rolls.  If your looking for a quick bite to eat or on a cold or rainy day this is your place!"}
{"text":"So glad this replaced the previous restaurant inside Lee Lee's. My wife and I frequent this place alot. My absolute favorite is the Pho Bo Kho; beef stew with noodles. The depth and richness of the beef stew is so wonderful, then it comes with these wonderfully tender chunks of fatty beef. You got to check it out."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I'm happy that they had the three colors dessert here. Oh so good. It's not as sweet as other places that I've gotten it at. I ordered the BBQ Pk and shredded pork dish (#42) and that was delicious. I tried some of their beef stew noodle dish and their egg noodle dish - both which were also good.  The spring roll was interesting because it was mostly all veggie with shrimp and beef slices. I'm used to the spring rolls having some mi fun (rice noodles) in it, too, but it was good regardless.   The vietnamese coffee was also good. Very sweet, but good. I also like how cheap and clean this place is."}
{"text":"Few would know that this pho location is the same one that was unfortunately closed due to tragic circumstances - Phuh Thanh in Mesa on extension.    They are the same family as Da' Vang - in Phoenix.  The broth of their food is top notch and on par as their big Phoenix brothers locale.      Seriously, one of the best flavorful Vietnamese food with bottom prices - it just doesn't make sense.  I'm a true Pho'natic and I challenge those who value their pho and other Vietnamese ethnic food to come try for yourself and you will definately see what I mean.  I live out in the southwest valley and the pho quality have not even rivaled that of Da 'Vang, Phu thanh (original), Saigon (good broth, slim quantity), Pho 43, etc.  We'll, having this gem here folks has been a true blessing and I hope they continue their success within LeeLees on Cactus."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for pho whenever I come down to Phoenix. The pho is priced reasonably for the sizes they provide and the broth is the best. The service is sometimes great and sometimes so-so but the persona of the restaurant is good. Will always keep coming back"}
{"text":"If I am in the NW valley, I usually head here for pho with the friends.  I always get the grilled pork sandwich and pho.  Both are delicious!  I'm a fan and will continue to visit this place when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"I like it here, small sitting place and inside the grocery restaurant but quick and good food. The bowls are huge, u can swim in there  but they're good quality. I got Banh canh, my favorite and not disappointed. I'll stop by again whenever in the area."}
{"text":"phu thanh from mesa moved to peoria... awesome food,, whenever on this side town, a must stop by..."}
{"text":"Because of the wonderful reviews this place received, I decided to stop in and try Pho for the first time.  The gentleman who seated my fiance and I was prompt and attentive (for the first part of our visit).  I could not make up my mind so I asked the server for a recommendation.  He suggested the #1.    It was a variety of meats in a wonderfully flavored beef broth that was very well seasoned.  After a few bites, I bit down on something rather unpleasant...I believe it was tripe.  I would have never thought that tripe was an ingredient (otherwise I would have specified it be omitted).  I quickly take my spoon and fish for as much of the stuff as I can find in my bowl...ick.  I LOVE most foods, but just the thought disgusts me.  Overall, I expect to come back again and attempt this PHO thing once more.  Perhaps make an educated order rather than relying on the gentleman to choose for me.  As for the restaurant, it is in Le Le's market...and once the burn of fish odor cools in your nose, its smooth sailing.  The diner was low key and not fancy at all, which I don't mind in the least bit.  I give this place 3.5 stars based on service, food and overall restaurant experience."}
{"text":"5 stars for the area   Pho = very good, best taste in NW Valley. This is my go to place for Pho. Eggrolls - didn't like these - too greasy Spring rolls - Yum + hoisin peanut sauce yum + fish sauce Yum Serving size - very good. Even an XL option if you're super hungry.  Ambiance - OK, small, fast food-ish, not the best part of the experience but if you're looking for great food this is the place to go. Prices - also AMAZING, best I've seen"}
{"text":"We come here often because of the great food and price. Service is horrible but that usually dont bother us except for today we showed up with a party of 5, four adults and 1 child at 11oclock in the morning on a Sunday. The host, which looked like a 16 year old kid, wanted to squeeze us in a booth which fit like 4 people. We asked for one of the round tables which there was plenty of at the time. His response was that lunch time was almost here and those were reserved for the busy hours. Be aware when you show up with a party of five before noon or they might squeeze you in that little booth too. We took our business elsewhere and I don't recommend this place at all unless you do not mind the service. Not to mention that we had ordered coffee before which took about 20 minutes to make and when we got the coffee it was all ice and 4 ounce of coffee. If I could give this place no stars I definitely would."}
{"text":"Value 5 stars Food quality 1 star  What I ordered Bun Bo Hue Bun Thit Nuong Cha Goi Banh Xeo  This is the perfect example of you get what you pay for.  Cheap but the food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Have not seen them for five years.  They were one of my favorite Vietnamese before the tragedy hit the staff and restaurant were forced to close.  Great to be treated nicely just like an old friend.  He told me that he has two wonderful children now and life is wonderful.  It is good where they welcome you.  Great memories from Pho Phu Thanh of Mesa."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food inside Lee Lee's market 75th & Cactus.. Peoria I used to drive the 45+ mins to eat at Phu Thanh in Mesa and loved their food. unfortunately that restaurant closed 6 months ago. Well the family has opened a new restaurant here in Peoria.    The best Pho I've found in Phoenix. They will make it any way you like. Rare beef on the side, steamed mung sprouts. extra noodle, Whatever condiments a true Pho lover would want. They will make it happen. The key is knowing what you want. and, not expecting someone to read your mind..  The herb pouch they use for the broth has the perfect blend of savory and sweet. One of the best things about their broth is how the flavor stays consistent all the way 'til your done. Truly a rare thing...  Banh Xeo is filled with fresh veggies and a few shrimp. Cut off some of this crispy crepe and add some fresh basil, cucumber, fish sauce, and roll it into an awesome lettuce wrap. This is good healthy eats !! Their Iced Coffee is top notch too.. They make all the various Vietnamese Sweet Bean, and tapioca desserts.  Trust me those are worth a try.. Pho Tan Thanh..  I look forward to rediscovering your extensive menu Soup Stew Noodle Broken Rice Meat Grills and wraps Pho Tan Thanh has it covered"}
{"text":"Finally I've found my favorite place to go whenever I crave Vietnamese food.   I'm so glad that finally we have a good Authentic Vietnamese food with reasonable low price in the West side!    I'm sure there are some other Vietnamese restaurants scatter around in the valley but this place \"Pho Tan Thanh\" is the best place of all (in my opinion).  Definitely, I love the low price with fresh ingredients, the perfect temperature in soup (Pho or soup is sizzling hot here unlike other Viet Restaurants are mild in temperature) with generous portion which I like a lot and the taste of everything on the menu here is so yummy delicious.  I've tried the following items on their menu and they are all surprisingly pretty good for the low price. *Bún Bò Hue (Hot & Spicy Beef Noodle Soup),  *Bún Bò Xào (stirfy beef with noodle),  *Pho,  *Bò Cuon Lá Nho (Beef in Grape leaf roll with rice noodles, lettuce, mint leaves, bean sprout, cucumber with special dipping sauce) *Lòng Heo xào cai chua xa te (is my favorite)  My plan is to go back here to try everything on their menu.  This is the only place I am willing to adventure to try new taste, new items because I know I can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I don't like to give away too many 5-stars, but when I do, I 'll give it to this place.  The Pho gods had answered my prayers.  I only asked for good, reputable Pho, instead I got exceptionally great Pho.  4-stars for the greatness plus 1 more star for making it CHEAP.  By that, I mean it was still in the $6 range! That's how I judge a Pho place, the taste, size and cost.  The freshness of the veggies and meat makes it even better.  Why not, its located inside a grocery store, right?  The first thing you need to know is its inside of Lee Lee Oriental Market.  Over the past year or so, the market seemed like it was losing its appeal and soon after this restaurant opened, it got life again.  I see more and more customers eating here which gives it notice and the credibility it deserves.  Prior establishments did not do so well.    I'm a coconut juice whore and they make it fantastic here! Its not overly sweet and served over ice, just the way I prefer it!  I will be supporting this place regularly.  Eat Pho all seasons baby!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Our pho looks like the broth was scooped off the top layer because it was filled with fat.  The service was just as bad - they kept bringing out the wrong food and drinks.  There was a female server there that didn't even speak a word and kept bringing out food and placing it at one end of the table and walking off without trying to figure out who it belonged to our telling us what it was.  One pho dish we asked for them to cook their normally rare meat all the way before serving it as the person was pregnant and couldn't risk eating anything remotely raw - but it still came out with half of the meat cooked and the other half raw.  I definitely would not come here again."}
{"text":"I'm dropping my rating 2 stars based on the rude and slow service. The food is excellent and inexpensive but the bad service is unacceptable. The waitress today literally dropped our food on the end of the table didn't make eye contact and walked away. You have to flag the server down for your check or anything else for that matter. I'm assuming this may be a cultural thing but I am always happy at Pho Avina so I will make the drive there for my twice a week fix. Too bad. Loved this place originally."}
{"text":"I love that it is so close to my house. I came here on a recommendation from a friend. Great prices and good sized portions. The egg rolls are amazing! I come here every other week for an order of pho!"}
