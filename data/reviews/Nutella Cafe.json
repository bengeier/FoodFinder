{"text":"4.5 stars for the photogenic food. They have waffles, crepes, and a number of different pizzas, which are essentially Nutella and a variety of fruits on puff pastry. It's with Nutella so you know tastiness is guaranteed. 

2.5 stars for the service. It was on the slow side and the staff seemed uncordial and slightly undertrained (understandable given this place just opened a few days ago)."}
{"text":"Not a professional pastry store obviously. Everyone working here is just stationed to be here from Loblaws I am assuming as you get a variety mix of people serving you over the bar; some of them are very slow, some of them act awkwardly and some of them are actually really good at what they are supposed to do. You never know what you'll get, that's party of the fun.

Easy access and can't go wrong with anything that has Nutella on top."}
{"text":"My son would give it 6 stars if he could. Amazing desserts. Lots of options. Plenty of seats. We loved the Nutella stuffed donut. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"For their grand opening, they had live music and gave out samples!

At this Nutella/Loblaws Cafe, they have crepes, pastries, waffles, donuts, coffee, jars of Nutella, and special dessert pizzas!

The prices are marked higher than the Nutella Cafe at Fort York (see my review), but I'm sure this conveniently-located one will win me over."}

We ended up here this weekend for brunch because the weekend before, we wanted to have waffles and there was a ridiculous line at Cora. I know what you're thinking...that was last weekend, what's that got to do with this weekend? Not wanting to wait 45 minutes to get a table at Cora, we went a few places over to Golden Griddle.  I know what you're thinking...yes, they still have a Golden Griddle in Toronto, and no, we clearly weren't thinking straight. After leaving Golden Griddle, we were thinking: surely there's gotta be a better place around here to get waffles at. And as we continued our Sunday morning, we walked over to Loblaws to get some groceries. Lo and behold, we see people sitting and eating...and WAFFLES no less! We looked at each other and said \"nooooooooooooo!!!\" Why didn't we go to get groceries first?? We would've spotted this place and ate here! After cursing for a few minutes (well, mostly it was me who cursed), we decided to come back the following weekend and try this place

So today we came and got a banana and hazzlenut crepe, and a pear waffle. The waffle would've come with ice cream, but we asked not to have it included. So instead, we received more pear over our waffle. The crepe and waffle were made in front of us. It probably took about 5-10 minutes total that we needed to wait for it. 

It tasted great!! But I mean, anything with nutella would taste great. (Well, maybe not anything, but most things). I really enjoyed the hazzelnut that was mixed in with the nutella and banana. It offered a different texture, and flavor. The pear waffle was pretty good. I think next time, I'll ask for the ice cream to come with it though. It is pretty big, and i think maybe the ice cream would mix up the flavor a little. I would probably try a few other things, like their nutella & pretzel pizza!!

So one thing to note about this place. It's inside the Loblaw. There's limited seating around it. There are two community tables besides it that we ended up sitting to eat at. The small tables in front of it were already taken. A few people looked like they were done with their brunch or coffee, or whatever. Everytime we looked to see if they were done, they'd still be sitting there. We'd take our eyes off them though, someone else would swoop in and take their spot! Doh!

Other than the seating being limited, I though the food was good, and service was pretty good too. I'd come back for sure."}
