{"text":"I got the Indochin. Substituted brown rice instead of the quinoa noodles and took some chili mango sauce to go. It was delicious!!!! Not only was it healthy it tasted good and was filling for more than the average lunch I get downtown. Definitely worth checking out. I hope this place stays around long term."}
{"text":"Great food. Food is medicine and this is the cure. Highly recommend. Fit and tasty!! The staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"What a great new restaurant! The food is fresh and delicious. I went on a workday during prime rush lunch hour and ordered online to avoid any crazy line. Much to my surprise and delight, my food was ready to go as soon as I got there. Also, it looked like the line was moving pretty rapidly as well. The sauce/dressing was my favorite part. I will definitely be going back to try out other unique combinations!"}
{"text":"Love the Gangnam City green bowl and Tokyo Bay grain.  Can't beat the Acai cups as a healthy dessert."}
{"text":"Yummy lunch spot! Tried Grabbagreen for the first time. Staff was extremely friendly and took the time to explain the menu and recommend their favorites. We got our food quickly. I go t the Southwest and subbed steak for the chicken. It was delicious! My friends each got something different and really liked theirs too! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! The gentleman who I think was the owner was very kind and a great host."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I go here a lot and the food is usually great. However, I've noticed pretty significant turnover in the employee staff and the service has suffered. Typically this is just slower service or occasionally the sauce missing (only a time or two) from my food. Today I received uncooked meat and have sent an email to the headquarters customer service. See the picture posted.  If you plan to go here, watch out for employees being trained while they make your food..."}
{"text":"I like the concept, but their smoothies are not as tasty compared to other juice/smoothie places. I got the \"Feeling Fabulous\" and it was not very fabulous nor did I finish the whole drink. It was not tasty. Most smoothies, the vegetable is blended very well, this one was not blended well which made it hard to drink. Smoothies are already difficult for some people to drink, so imagine the horror they would've had drinking one of these.   Inside was clean and had other food items to grab on the go."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Walked in and everyone kind of started to file out of the back even though they were open 2 hours prior, it seemed like they just started to turn things in when we walked in. DO NOT get an Açaí Bowl....it comes in a plastic cup and unlike most açaí places instead of cocoa nibs they just poured raw cocoa on it. Not very good."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all by this place. It seems very visually appealing and healthy and the staff was really nice, however, the food was meh. I had the Tokyo Bay grain bowl. The size of it was small, it was not even  warm which might be my mistake as I thought it would be hot. The ingredients did not seem very fresh and the salmon was not very good either, in fact, some pieces were really chewy. The dressing was also not what I expected from a ginger dressing. I sat outside and when I wanted some siracha or hot sauce, no employee was to be found. They are new, so more room for improvement, that's? for sure. Let's hope the salmon won't cause me stomach issues."}
{"text":"When looking for a restaurant with healthy options, Grabbagreen is definitely the way to go. Not only is every meal organic, fresh, and healthy, they are also filling and contain a wide variety of ingredients. I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"I tried grabbagreen for the first time yesterday. The food is great and the service is amazing! I ordered the SoCal grabba grain which is the best of both worlds. It's like a salad with quinoia noodles! Very filling and delicious. I sat there chatting for a few hours and ordered an Acai Amazonia cup Togo. I can't decide which was my favorite. For $17 total, I will likely order both in my near future visit."}
{"text":"Great food and service. All the food is healthy and tasty. Love the French Quarter with quinoa instead of the rice. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and always choose the \"grab your own\" bowl where you pick one base (grain or green), one protein, five nutrients (e.g. cucumber, beet, spinach, goji berry, etc.), one dairy, herb and housemade sauce. If you like to be creative, this is for you!!  Today, I changed it up a bit and elected for the Mediterranean Sea bowl, which consists of brown rice, chicken, cucumber, kalamata olive, mint, red onion, red pepper, spinach, feta, and Mediterranean pomegranate sauce. It was a perfect blend of different flavors, textures and colors. The entire bowl (which is quite large) is 523 calories. The only change that I would suggest is to mince the mint leaves rather than leaving them whole. This would allow for a more homogenous flavor in the dish.   There is a pitcher of water with orange slices available to customers for free! Definitely a perk of this place.   I love Grabbagreen's focus on high quality ingredients and they're push to add color to everyone's diet. I may be a little biased considering I have a nutrition background. :)"}
{"text":"In town visiting and found this little jewel. Loved it, reminds me of the healthy eats at home. Had the pina protein smoothie and it tasted amazing. Was very light yet filling and tasted great. They have lots of options and the service was friendly. Will definitely try to come back before heading back to cali."}
{"text":"I am quite disappointed with the service. Took entirely too long. I have to say it was ok bc I showed up and only one person was working and has no idea what she was doing and the other person was no where to be found. By the time I got to order and pay the place was full with ppl walking out bc they didn't want to wait any longer. (Even the person that ordered online had to wait bc they hadn't made it yet) When I tried to ask them about the Stealz app that I had that said I got a free grabbasnack neither knew what to do so I just put it away and waited another 15 min for my order, a kids smoothie and an Amazonia acai cup. Everyone else got their order before me as well. She gave me a card for free on my next order so maybe next time I'll update with a better rating."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be like chop't... but it wasn't. The selection is super limited. Like they only have Spinach and baby kale for lettuce... I won't be back"}
{"text":"This place was everything I was looking for. As someone with food sensitivities I wanted a yummy place to eat without the hassle of asking about every item on the menu. It was spectacular and the service was even better! They served us as they were closing and even let us stay and eat! I'll be back. YUM."}
{"text":"I'm in absolute love with this establishment and is my favorite place in Charlotte. Everything is so fresh and crisp and so good for you!  We enjoyed the mango breakfast bowl which comes with mango banana pineapple brown rice quinoa granola and almond milk. I make a similar concoction at home and it's so nice to find somewhere I can have a nice breakfast I'm used to while constantly traveling.  So far my favorite smoothie is the Oxidation Eliminator. A friend tried a sip and said it tasted like a slushee. I didn't think so but I thought the berries and green tea was tasty!"}
{"text":"I greatly appreciate the creative menu options and what grabba green is trying to accomplish. If you go in with low expectations on execution, you might be pleasantly surprised or if you just need nourishment for your body, it does the trick.  Love: garage door concept. Pitfall: When I walked in today, it was like hurricane winds blowing my hair all around. I couldn't help wonder what was being blown onto my food...the plastic cup I was trying to put sauce in was blown away, etc. you get the picture.  Love: healthy options, pitfall: brown scoop of brown avocado on my Tokyo bowl and browning broccoli. The salmon was yummy.  I'll go back when I need healthy food."}
{"text":"Thankful to have a healthier lunch option in Uptown, as it is an area surprisingly lacking in healthy, affordable quick places to eat that are tasty, but compared to other salad/health places I've had (e.g. Sweetgreen or Lemonade) in other cities, I would put Grabbagreen on the same level as Freshii or Energy Cafe. The website looks great and the ingredients are promising, but there are a few hiccups.   I ordered the South Beach that comes with avocado, beet, blueberry, hemp, kale, parsley, pistachio, spinach, feta and a mediterranean pomegranate sauce. Sounds great, but when I got back to my office, I opened up a salad with a brown avocado, maybe 6 blueberries total, and no hemp or feta. All in all it was a fine salad, but part of the appeal of this place is the diversity in ingredients, and if not all ingredients are included, it somewhat defeats the purpose.   Also - beware the pricing on the proteins - its $3 to add any protein, including blackbeans or edamame...since when do black beans and edamame cost the same as steak or salmon?   I was hoping for a better showing from Grabbagreen. It is a quick fix for a healthier lunch. However the food I received (or lack there of) for the price I paid definitely left something to be desired. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Grabbagreen they hadn't been opened long - and, as other reviewers have mentioned, it wasn't a great experience.  But, they have worked out the bugs and I love grabbing lunch here!    The food is so fresh and yummy - my favorites (so far) are the On the Border salad and Southwest grain bowl.  The box may look smallish, but it is packed full of goodness!    Tip - download the Grabbagreen app and pre-order your food.  Everytime I have done this, I just walk in and my food is ready to go."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with Grabbagreen! My friend and I went for lunch today (a Wednesday) and got there later than the usual rush (12:45pm-ish). There were 2 people waiting for their order and 2 people in front of us in line. My friend placed her order and although I was going to order a smoothie, I was too overwhelmed with awesome choices so I went to the side to decide. We waited, and waited, and waited. Another rush came and 7 more people ordered after us. The frustrating part was watching the staff. No one took ownership of one order, it was a line of work. Usually that would work, but it seemed an array of chaos. People were running back and forth, no one was finishing the orders, and people kept yelling customer's names to ask them what they ordered after they already waited 15 minutes plus.  After 25 minutes for a rice/grain entrée, my friend opened up her small box (seriously $10 for a tiny box??!) and this is what she ordered....Avocado, Brown Rice, Cayenne, Parsley, Red Onion, Red Pepper, Shrimp, Spinach, Creamy Avocado Sauce   Hers was filled with...brown rice, parsley, CORN, BROCCOLI (3 pieces), shrimp I didn't even order my smoothie because I was too sad looking at the limp parsley bits.  I really want to like you Grabbagreen. You have awesome choices....please work it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoothies and juices! Haven't tried the food yet but it all sounds delicious. Just had the Looking Luscious but added mango --- yum!! Also had the Anti Inflammatory Elixir.   My bestie is sipping on Oxidation Elimination --- yummy too!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooo...... food is good, stop complaining about portions people, the depth of the bowls are good & healthy size.   Buuuttt..... this customer service is lacking. They are not rude or anything, rather need to he coached the basics like \"greetings, eye contact, acknowledge your presence..and listen to the order. Rather unfortunate b/c it results in everyone waiting confused, unsure of who is next, questioning how to start the order..etc. I watched 2 guys walk out due to the disorganization and wait time.   Luckily I had just finished some sun salutations in yoga on the rooftop so my patience was good.   Honey .... If I am paying $7 a smoothie, $10 a salad..acknowledge my presence and ensure I am helped. Little things."}
{"text":"I am new to clean eating and love this place. I know I'm getting a healthy balanced lunch and it is very delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering GrabbaGreen via Postmates and I'm very disappointed. I ordered two smoothies and an acai cup. The acai is very droopy and slimy, not at all like acai I have tried from other spots in charlotte. Yuck. I requested to add bananas and granola.. the granola was put right on top of the acai, under the fruit so it was already soggy by the time I started eating. The banana wasn't sliced. Looks like they just plopped half a banana into the cup. Hopefully the smoothies are decent, probably won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"I ordered through Postmates. We were missing part of our order and the part that we got was nearly inedible. The kids meal was soggy greens (I asked for grains) with less than an ounce of chewed up chicken. The chicken noodle soup was broth, over-cooked noodles and the same chewed up chicken. Health food doesn't have to be bland with minuscule portions. If you want somewhere healthy, go to Luna's, fresher and more inventive with pretty much the same prices. The portions were beyond tiny here. The kid's meal could have fit in the palm of my hand. Was looking for something healthy, but will definitely not try this place again. Be warned!"}
{"text":"I typically like to wait several weeks before trying a new place to let them get their shit together, but Grabbagreen was calling to me.  It's in the former Yoforia space in the Epicentre. The shop is very clean and attractive. There isn't much room to eat in, so I imagine in cold weather it's going to get very snug in there. On a nice day like today, though, the doors are open and it's quite pleasant.   A manager told me while we were waiting in line that Grabbagreen is structured such that once you've placed your order, you should receive your food in five minutes or fewer. It's a flurry of activity behind the counter -- there were probably a dozen employees assembling lunches.   I got the French Quarter grain bowl. It comes with shrimp, brown rice, and avocado. It was a little heavy on the red onion -- I brushed my teeth when I got back to the office and I can still taste onion! The meal was around room temperature, which was fine but I feel like I may have enjoyed it more if the rice were warm enough to wilt my spinach. The portions are great, too -- the little box they handed me seemed small but my lunch left my pleasantly full without being weighed down.   For someone like me who lives gluten free, this place is very exciting; everything on the menu is naturally GF. It's so nice to not have to ask a million questions or risk getting sick because someone didn't change their gloves. I can choose anything here and feel like I made a smart decision.   I think Grabbagreen is going to enjoy success in Uptown. It's healthy and quick, and the employees are all extremely happy and pleasant."}
{"text":"Amazing food! For everyone complaining about the portion sizes. Healthy food is significantly more expensive and served in small portions ( learn portion control- size is perfect). Go eat at McDonalds if you want large portions for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Wow. No idea how this place stays in business. I just ordered from DoorDash. Got a chicken noodle soup with not a trace of chicken and a \"broth\" that tasted like water, and a mac and cheese that literally was a bowl of plain noodles with maybe 10 noodles out of the entire bowl actually having cheese on them, and even then it was just melted cheddar, not a creamy sauce. This was my first experience with this restaurant, and it will definitely be my last. Beyond terrible."}
{"text":"I essentially for the South Beach salad but I did a build your own to get rid of some things I didn't want. Portion size, it's pretty small but it took me forever to finish it because I was dreading every bite. I opened the box and it just did not look appealing whatsoever. It was soggy and the juices from the beets were leaking out of the box. Maybe it's a little too healthy, which is why I did not enjoy my salad very much. I think next time I will opt for a grain bowl. However, my coworker got the grain bowl and it came in an even smaller box."}
{"text":"I travel to Charlotte often, and when staying uptown, often look for quick and healthy lunch and dinner options. I visited Grabbagreen about a dozen times, if not more, over the past month, so I have given them a fair chance. About half of the times, my bowl orders were incorrect (I was given a completely different menu item which I didn't realize until I opened it in my hotel room). More than a few times, ingredients such as salmon, chicken and shrimp were not fresh. As far as bowls and salads, the employees here don't seem to know what they are doing, looking and acting very confused. The juices, however, have been good, which is the only reason I'm giving this place two stars.   Overall, it's a great concept but they can't make it work. Not recommended - I'm not going back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab lunch. Proper portions are always served. Very healthy conscious place. Would definitely recommend to anyone that likes eating clean. My go to bowls are the French quarter and Southwest bowl."}
{"text":"From out of town and trying to eat healthy in Charlotte is a challenge!  The southern cuisine is so wonderful, it's hard to make smart choices!  I found this gem on yelp and gave it a try for breakfast.  I had the chicken collard wrap.  It was warm and tasty.  Where else can you find something under 300 calories with 28 grams of protein for breakfast?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab breakfast or lunch when you wanna feel a little better about what you're eating. The food is surprisingly good to be as \"healthy\" as it is. The juices and smoothies are also great. I am not able to go here as often as I'd like, because it is a little pricey. I do enjoy the customizable meals and beverages. My favorite is the moroccan macaroni and cheese. And you can add on as many veggies as you'd like for an additional fee. Same with the juices. I usually take a base juice and will add in additional fruits and veggies to accommodate however I'm feeling that particular day. Be sure to enroll into their points program so that you can earn money off of future purchases."}
{"text":"Had lunch there a few weekends ago and the food was excellent. Service was great and they were very patient with us since this was our fist time. While eating the server offered up a few samples of their smoothies, which were terrific. Excited about the one opening up in Ballantyne which will be a lot closer to me."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I didn't love the food I had from Grabbagreen - it was almost a little too healthy! However, the gentleman who helped my friend and I last week was so wonderful, I wouldn't be able to give anything less than four stars. After mentioning our late night, he made some recommendations to get us back on our feet.   My friend and I both ordered the juice of the day, which had ginger, mint, lemon and, I think one other ingredient. It was not delicious, but I wasn't going for taste with this beverage - I was looking for a remedy! And I do feel the drink helped to deliver that.   We also both ordered the Gulf of Mexico salad, which has (copy/pasted directly from their website) \"Avocado, Cayenne, Cucumber, Egg, Green Onion, Parsley, Red Onion, Shrimp, Spinach, Creamy Avocado Sauce.\" Healthy? Heck yes! Delicious? Mehhhh. The shrimp were nicely seasoned and everything was very fresh, but the dressing didn't have any kick and the onions were overpowering.   All of this said, I really enjoyed the Grabba chili, which was a last-minute add. It's vegan and made with (again, copy/pasting here) \"Black Bean, Cilantro, Corn, Quinoa, Red Onion, Red Pepper, Tomato.\" It was unique and had a kick. I've actually been hoping to find a similar version back home in Philly!   I love the concept of Grabbagreen and I especially love that all of their nutritional info is readily available as well. Even though I wasn't crazy about some of my choices, I'd for sure give them another shot if I once again find myself in an area with Grabbagreen."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during the week, got there on the early side (around 11:30) and there were only a few customers. The staff was pleasant and quick. Ordered the On the Border salad with the avocado dressing to go. While overall it was filling, there was absolutely nothing special about the salad; very bland and almost no flavor to the dressing. The real deal-breaker was that the avocado was so bad that I had to throw it away, along with anything it had stuck to. If you value flavor and quality ingredients, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is great NOW! When they first opened I felt they had a rough start as any other business first opening. They definitely worked out the kinks! I love going here on my lunch break! It's one of the best spots and if only spot for good, healthy and clean food!   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE YOGURT AGAVE BBQ SAUCE! That sauce is the kitties titties!!  A lot of people comment on the price being high but for a restaurant that is solely based on clean eating their prices are reasonable and in line with other clean food spots."}
{"text":"Oh man. Bad start. I was extremely excited to try Grabbagreen. To have more restaurants coming around that fit my nutritional lifestyle was promising. Tonight I tried to go in and it was 9:10pm on a Friday. The doors are locked and two employees tell me they're closed. \"Sorry\". They said \"We only close at 10 on weekends.\" Isn't Friday a weekend I thought to myself. Maybe I was confused? So I confirm that today is Friday and the door, website, and Yelp say Grabbagreen does not close until 10:00 pm on Friday.   Unfortunately, this is completely unacceptable. Two employees either simultaneously forgot what day it was, tried to close early, or there are errors on three separate informative sources. I used to work in the food service all through high school, I get it. No one likes to serve after you've started cleaning and/or tasted the joy of closing time. However, you have to deal with it for the paycheck and the respect of the business you're working for. And... it was 50 minutes until close... not two.   I will update my review when I actually get the chance to taste the food, that is if I decide to try again. I feel this needs to be brought to the management teams attention for the sake of future success."}
{"text":"My first time having a meal at this restaurant. Very delicious and excellent service. The ladies helped me put together a very tasty and healthy lunch. It was a little expensive, but then again eating clean always is."}
{"text":"A great healthy but fast option with fresh ingredients and lots of vegetarian and nutrient conscious individuals. I bet pricey depending on what you get but not outrageous. The orange salad was very fresh and clean tasting."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them twice on Uber eats. The first time they forgot on of my smoothies which is frustrating but forgivable. Today I ordered from them again only to have my order cancelled after 20 mins.   The food I had from them was good enough for me to try it again.  It's so hard to get healthy food in Charlotte I really had high hopes for this place."}
