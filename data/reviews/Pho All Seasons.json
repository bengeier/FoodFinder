Never again.."}
{"text":"Love the food here and the prices are amazing. Where else can you have two entrees and a huge appetizer and have the bill come out to be 25 bucks?  We even left with left overs for the next day and we are not light eaters. I love the salt and pepper prawn.  It is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The same folks who own this PAS owned the PAS in Des Moines.  It is faaaaantastic."}
{"text":"When I walked inside this place, it was basically empty. I was curious to why this place was empty until I ordered my food. It took them almost half an hour to bring me my food when I was the only customer in the place, at the time. Also, I ordered water and they bring me a cup of tap water that tasted like bathroom water. The place has no a/c. They left their door open to let air in, but they were really letting flies in. Flies were buzzing all over the place. My soup was not even hot when it was served to me. Broth was too bland. Never went back ever since."}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried most, if not every, vietnamese/pho joint in the area and always find ourselves coming back to this place.  The broth in their pho has a fantastic depth of flavor (no MSG).  Very inexpensive for the quality and quantity you recieve.  I also highly recommend the salted lemonade with sprite or soda water.  The service is fairly prompt and polite.  It's never very busy."}
{"text":"What can I say, ah, papaya salad is the BOMB. Ang the folks who run this place are pretty friendly, they got me free sugarcane drink everytime! Bun Saigon was a huge portion and there's nothing you can go wrong with the prices."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho in Phoenix. Sometimes they are out of items (salted lemonade soda or fresh bread), but the pho always brings me back. My favorite is the brisket w/extra veggies. Sometimes I get the beef stew (if there is bread). Also, the portion size is good. Sometimes my husband and I split the large and leave full."}
{"text":"green papaya salad...must order item.  One of my favorite restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"My pho of choice is chicken, and the chicken pho at this place had an unusual flavor - kind of sweet.  But otherwise, not much other flavor.  I had to keep adding soy sauce & sriracha but overall a disappointing meal.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I must say that this is one of the only restaurants that my wife an I really stand behind.  EVERY time we come here, we are always blown away by how wonderful the pho is.  No MSG, free range chicken, super sweet music on Fridays; it's great.  In all fairness, i have not tried much on the menu because the pho is just THAT GOOD!  we did however have some tiger prawn spring rolls and some green tea ice cream that pretty much knocked our socks off as well.  We are regulars here and will be for a long time."}
{"text":"It had a dirty sticky feel but that could be because it was sticky, I had the hardest time getting my shoe off the floor. The Pho was watered down and seriously lacking in flavor. The bun salad had a strange taste but I am pretty sure that it has something to do with the aerosol air freshener pointed at the table. The gentleman working was very unfriendly and left us feeling like  we were bothering him when I asked for a drink but in all honesty at that point my water had been empty for 10 minutes before I asked. We only went because our normal place was closed for the night but we will definitely not make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"Poor service, indifferently cleaned food, and weak seasoning.  The menu also didn't match the food actually served, so I got to eat pork for the first time since my conversion 20 years ago.   They were FAR from apologetic. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Yuck. This was the worst pho I have ever had. Bad broth, ugly meat, wilted veggies. Service was awful. The dude up front was coughing violently, and blowing his nose. Go to Khai Hoan. I feel sick right now and may have food poisoning-  -Update I definitely got food poisoning from Pho All Seasons-"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!  You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food.   What I tried...  Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.    Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?  Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.  Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown.   If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.    This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.   Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones."}
