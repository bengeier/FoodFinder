{"text":"If you are in the mood for bad food and poor service in a somewhat dangerous environment, this is the place for you. I walked in with a few friends after work yesterday and one of the totally wasted regulars wanted to rumble with us before the door closed behind us.  Passing on the invitation to throw down, we ordered some food and a few beers. It took a while to get the beers, but we needed them to wash down the marginal food. (I had chili which I'm still tasting 36hrs later). Before we left another totally wasted regular (female) wanted to beat up my friend in the parking lot because he wasn't interested in buying her a beer.  Never going back. Probably won't even drive down that road again!!!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved here from the East Coast and have to say that we love this place. Sad to say, these kind of joints are a dying breed out east and it's a pleasure to hang out somewhere where you feel so welcome and the regulars are REAL. The drinks are right on, the food is homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. Horrible service and horrible food. We waited 20 minutes to get drinks (which the waitress got 2 out of 4 drinks wrong). We had to fetch our own menus. Another 15 minutes to order and then after waiting another 20 minutes, I was told they were out of cod. It's a fish fry on a Friday night and they ran out of fish before 5pm!? So I just ordered fries and never got those. My son ordered the coconut shrimp and at $4.50 he got 5 tiny shrimp with some weird breading. The server never came back to refill our drinks and was rude when I asked for the check after the second time. Oh and the guy that looks like he owns the place was walking around with a baby pig. Never going back."}
{"text":"Wow... was really surprised at how good the food is.  Went with a couple of other people and everyone loved it.   Doesn't look like much but the food is great and the drinks are cheap."}
{"text":"Great dive bar...if you need a shot and beer with no pretensions this is the place. Get a hamburger...can't go wrong ...order anything more and it's at your own risk. Come in have a beer with friends...basic and simple...good prices"}
{"text":"Little neighborhood bar for the seniors at the trailer park to come to. Small menu but decent food Good Rueben! Lean corned beef. Everyone loves a heavy handed bartender for jack and coke! No wifi and can't get a signal in there. Little too hot thermostat set at 72 sweating my nips off. No more jack for me!"}
