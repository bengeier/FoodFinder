{"text":"I'm updating my review to indicate that General Manager; Natalie, Hecht, responded to my feedback. I'm giving Picazzo's 4 stars because of their response. Recognizing customer concerns/complaints are a sign of great customer service. I will be going back. Thank you Natalie!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place to eat out at.  My kids and I are gluten intolerant and there are few places we can actually go out and have a variety to choose from.  We have had pizza from other places and it was ok.  The first time we had ordered yhe pizza and it came to the table.... The pizza actually looked like a real pizza!!
 I have eaten at several locations and have always found the food wonderful.
Love the cheesy garlic bread & croutons (GF)....

If you like some spice the chiptole pasta has that... My daughter didn't care for the meatballs but everything else we have had the last six months delightful"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I eat clean and gluten-free and that leaves very few options for eating out, so I'm very thankful for Picazzo's. The food is always excellent and I feel healthy and nourished after each meal. They have my undying devotion for putting Tiramisu on the menu. The service is great and the employees are always fun, friendly and pleasant to talk to. Everything about Picazzo's makes for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've been there since they went all organic. The menu isn't as obnoxiously large as it was before (HUGE bonus!) but the food is just as good. We tried the whole wheat crust but our taste buds didn't like it too much. I love that there are options for those who are vegans, gluten free, etc. There is pretty much something for everyone. The pizza is not bad but you definitely have to be in the mood to try something new, especially if you are new to the \"foodie\" world like I am. 

We started with the spinach/artichoke dip. Highly recommend it! It comes in an edible bread bowl with slices of pita, celery and carrots. The dip was good with all four options. 

There were only two servers on at the time and the place was busy! We still never waited for a refill on drinks. We will be back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have been here and now I remember why. Seriously the food is just not good. Items missing on the dish, rotting vegetables in the salad. There was no seasoning in the pasta. There was not one spring of fresh herbs anywhere.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I was visiting for the week as a Mayo Clinic patient and was recommended here by our hotel shuttle driver. Honestly overjoyed! Me and my gluten eating mother shared the chicken Parmesan and the Cannelloni, it was amazing!! One thing I have been craving ever since has to be the Alfredo sauce (since I live in Portland I cant exactly fly to Arizona just for there Alfredo sauce, as much as I would). If anyone is willing to give me the recipie I might just die of happiness."}
{"text":"I go here a lot!  I can't eat gluten and that makes a typical Italian place, kind of off limits for me..... a problem for this Italian girl!  This restaurant is conveniently located in the Scottsdale Promenade, a nice mix of classy and casual.   The staff is fast and courteous, ALWAYS.  You can sit in the dining room, the bar complete with TV for sports enthusiasts, or  the outdoor patio which is huge and very comfortable with greenery and misters.  But the biggie for me is it has one of the largest gluten free, organic menu's I have seen in Scottsdale.  Sometimes a girl just wants pizza and a beer!!  Here I can have it G-Free and my dinner guest can go all wheat bellie crazy."}
{"text":"They have the best gluten free pizza that I have tasted. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"Great gluten free menu!  Appetizers, pizzas, all kinds of variety.  Items are a little pricey, but it's worth it to support such a wide variety of options especially for people suffering from celiac.  

Restaurant had nice decor with a fun environment.  Thanks to the gluten free menu, it was my first time eating pizza in quite a while!  

I'd definitely return if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and with good reason: Picazzo's has a separate gluten-free menu (which can be found online) for celiac sufferers, as well as those who are more sensitive or allergic to the effects of wheat. Kitchen utensils and ovens are reserved for the preparation and cooking of gluten-free doughs and other goodies. This helps prevent contamination, which can wreak havoc on one later. For the most part, the GF menu is exactly the same as the regular menu and this is a wonderful thing. A GF diet can be VERY restrictive, but Picazzo's has really gone out of its way to accommodate those of us, who cannot tolerate gluten and has won several awards for having done so. How many restaurants can truly say that?

Neither the dough nor the toppings are bland. The salads all taste delicious. The servers are always quick and very courteous, and they take the time to get to know you by name when you are a regular. The prices are a little excessive, but I think the quality and freshness of the food is outstanding and that this is well worth paying a little extra to obtain. It's definitely a value call for all of us, but the peace of mind and shear delight afforded me by this restaurant's having a separate GF menu and cooking facilities makes this a top choice for me!"}
{"text":"Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.

This place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this. 

According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).

The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.

Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Great Gluten free and Organic options for Italian Style restaurant."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in awhile and I don't typically order by price, but the $53 bill for lunch today (not counting tip) definitely caught my attention. My son and I ordered a diet coke, gorgonzola ravioli ($16.50) and a 16\" pizza ($29.50). Seriously, $30 for a pizza? I even checked the online menu when I got home to verify a mistake hadn't been made. In fairness, the food is always good and today was no exception, but I know when I'm being gouged and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a pomegranate martini, tasted like water & a very odd color.  The martini glass was chipped.  Had Nonna's pizza & it was delicious with a thin, crisp crust & wonderful flavors.  We ate dinner on the patio & it was filthy.  The whole area needs to be power washed, including the tables & chairs.  I think we should have ordered take out."}
{"text":"While the service was on the slow side, the food was flavorful -  strong but not overpowering or salty, which I liked a lot. Will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch, along with my sister-in-law this afternoon.  We were pleasantly surprised that we could still order from the lunch specials and that bottles of wine are 1/2 price on Wednesday and Saturday.

We started out with the spinach and artichoke appetizer.  How nice it is to have vegetables and pita for dipping.  Yummy!

I had the salad and Cajun Chicken pasta.  I had kale added to my salad (at no extra charge!).  It was fresh and tasty.  The pasta was pleasantly spicy with a combination of vegetables and chicken.

Our server, Peter D., was super friendly and efficient.

I can't give five stars, since we didn't have room for dessert or drinks, but we will certainly rectify that on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, especially enjoy the organic options!  I do wish the kale salad came in a petite version that was cheaper. One can eat in a high end restaurant for the price of a salad with lunch here. I lived in Sedona when this chain began, and think the quality has been maintained."}
{"text":"Ordered the new Zupo salad.  Was a perfect post hike meal.  The flavor was great, portions just right.  I am currently tracking my macros and they were nice enough to give me the weight of the quinoa and protein and add some extra chicken in so i could meet my count.  Not alot of places do this.  I certainly appreciate it.   Well done!"}
{"text":"My kids and wife have dairy and gluten issues, which makes this a great place to go.  This place has great food and lots of choices."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but I don't think I really gave the place a chance until tonight. I've only come by for happy hour, to split a salad, or a pizza. Tonight I tried the baked brie app as well as the artichoke dip--both were fabulous! Tonight (Sat) was half priced bottles of wine so obviously we had to get on board with that-the pinot noir we ordered was great and not expensive...a happy medium! For dinner, I really enjoyed a Thai lasagna (yes, Thai) and it was incredible! Oh and gluten free if you are like me and try to go that route. Hubs had the Thai spaghetti and meatballs and he is hard to impress but it must have been perfect because he LOVED it! My aunt had a gf pizza that I tried a bit of and was good and my uncle had something that I don't recall specifics of but he seemed to enjoy enough to not have leftovers. Service was great; pleasant and quick and I I feel like if you come here for a full, nice dinner, you will leave very happy!"}
{"text":"Will never be returning to Picazzos! My pizza had a hair in it and the mushrooms tasted slimy. The service was even worse! I wish they had better food because I live very close by. It seems like I'm not the only person who had bad service maybe they need to look at these reviews..."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch special.  For around $9.00 you can choose either a slice of pizza, pasta or a sandwich with either a really good salad or soup. Also included in this price is your beverage. Not a bad price for a lunch."}
{"text":"Absolute horrible service and customer care. Who doesn't let a person know their food is ready for a to go order? This place. Then the manager has the nerve to tell me its my fault? Are you kidding me? I'm.glad I don't live here but if I did I'd never come back. 

Got a refund which the manager tried to argue about not refunding my check for non-existent food.  So I haven't had the food. It looked mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Just a random walk in after great Yelp reviews.  Great service, knowledgable staff and food was amazing.  All organic and food was ready within 10 mins.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Food is great. Barstaff is friendly and responsive to any and all needs. Always consistent with quality. A regular spot for great food especially if you have a family member or friend with any food allergy."}
{"text":"Incredible service, nice ambiance and excellent food. Had the veggie pasta and the avacado pasta dinners for lunch. Food couldn't have been more perfect. Pasta was al dente and spiced just right. Definitely one of the best!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that yummy gluten-free pizza was coming back to this location (under the Picazzo's name in October 2013.)  But the excitement has been fading....  Prior to the Buon Gusto's closing, we had contact them about hosting an event for approx 100 guests. After the closing and hearing about the planned reopening, we have attempted to contact Picazzo's through their website/email.  No response. Ever.  I have to wonder about any business that is willing to completely ignote a potential large booking."}
{"text":"Food was average... very disappointed in service, server dropped a glass of ice tea and it broke over my daughter and I. We both had to pick glass off of us, and are leaving with wet clothes. They could have done better then offering us $5.00 off our bill."}
{"text":"I am a frequent patron of both the north Scottsdale, AZ location and the Cactus & Tatum location and always have a good experience. Last night, Saturday 02/28 a friend and I went to the Cactus & Tatum Picazzo's and I felt the need to let someone know about the above and beyond experience provided to us by our server Emily. She was so personable and friendly and made it such a remarkable visit. I genuinely appreciate how attentive and considerate she was throughout our time there and will definitely keep an eye out for this amazing young lady next time I'm craving some delicious Picazzo's food. Tremendous work Emily!! You made my non-birthday a very memorable day!"}
{"text":"The servers AND food are hands down gorgeous. Gluten free tiramisu and pizza!  Such a delight."}
{"text":"Great yummy gluten free good! Meh service, the server couldn't be bothered to refill my water, with only two other customers. I HATE when my water doesn't get refilled :("}
{"text":"Great, a restaurant that serves organic and gluten free!  But wait.  Sat at the bar, ordered an organic salad.  Came with mixed greens, a small cucumber, some shredded carrots and every other \"add on\" was minuscule.  The dressing was supposed to be olive oil, garlic and lemon juice.  No lemon taste what so ever.  Just garlic.  Like \"burn your mouth\" garlic.  AND the mixed greens had several \"old and bad\" sections that I had to pull out.  Shouldn't the cook have done this before he served it if the greens weren't fresh?  Bottom line, expensive ($15 with tax and tip) and not huge portions of the organic veggies.  I could have bought a bag of organic greens at Trader Joes for 3 bucks and had the same thing!"}
{"text":"Makes the olive garden look five star. Despite their claims they most certainly are not using all fresh ingredients and the food is bland bland bland with a metric ton of garlic. The pizza is awful and overpriced. When I complained they comped me $25( which is nearly twice the price of a pizzeria bianco's pizza!) at which point I gave them another try. The lasagna was so bland, the salad was absolutety Spartan. All the way around avoid this place. You'd enjoy Italian from fuzzolis better."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes while being ignored.  Hostess had attitude and servers completely ignored us while waiting on newly arrived patrons.  Menu is not impressive and very over priced, $2.20 for pepperoni?  How are so many fooled? This place is very bad."}
{"text":"Could not believe the management!!! We went for dinner last night and they were quite busy. The hostess said there would be about a 20 minute wait. No problem. We have been there at least a dozen times and the food is good. There is only a small bench for two people at the front of the restaurant where we sat and waited (we were a party of three). During that time four or five parties attempted to get in but decided not to wait and left. A few tables opened up where upon the hostess came to us and said that the manager told her not to seat any more people because the kitchen was backed up!? No place to wait, people lining up and tables opening up and telling your guests that you're not seating anyone..? Really? Seems like a bad decision. I can think of many hospitable ways to handle this situation to keep your patrons happy. That wasn't one of them. Needless to say we left  to go elsewhere. I'll still probably go back because their food and menu is certainly above average and the atmosphere is nice. But this episode was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty food. Lunch special is a good deal.  Our waitress was fast and friendly. Greens are sourced from Arizona farmers. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place has my favorite pizza ever...period. Everything is so fresh and yummy! My favorite pizza is their riccota, peperoni and Sausage. It's AWESOME. They have a great happy hour as well. I've been to all of their locations and this one is my favorite :)."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good gluten free restaurant for my wife, who is gluten intolerant.  We had a Gorgonzola pear salad, huge portion, and very fresh.  
The gluten free pizza was as good as a regular pizza.  Fabulous crust, fresh ingredients, and good service.   I think we will be back before our vacation is over."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu.  I need a low salt dinner and they had the information readily available. I picked out the eggplant."}
{"text":"I have been here before.
which is an excellent start to a review. you wouldn't touch  a hot stove twice right?!.
so why would you pay for repeat crap.
great gluten free food. cold wine. not too loud .
hot food .
love!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Try the Indian Curry pizza it is fabulous! Also this place IS NOT closed...thank god!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, a step.up from peter piper!
First time there, waited 15 to be served!
Finally a waiter saw this and was nice enough to come over, no managment in this place, seems like the right does not know whatcthe left is doing, not worth a return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience. I used to love this particular location of Picazzos.  Then it changed brand names and now it's back to Picazzos again.  When it was operating under a different name the quality slipped a bit. when it switched back we decided to try it.  Bad decision.  We ordered a large Greek salad and garlic cheese bread.  the first thing we noticed is the salad was about a third the size it had been with the original Picazzos and even though the menu said the Greek salad there were no olives at all.  a Greek salad with no olives?  The dressing was thick and clumpy.  The garlic cheese bread was bland with no flavor.  It was supposed to be on foccia bread but was closer to Texas toast.  the bread was so blah we barely touched it.  when we told our server he just shrugged at the lack of olives and said yeah they had had a lot of complaints about the cheese bread because they were changing the menu but hadn't updated it yet so the bread was actually vegan it just didn't say that. Huh?  for vegan might have been great but that's not what we ordered or why  we were there.  The server didn't offer to take it off the bill or do anything really.   Bottom line we won't be back.  guess that explains why there was only one other table who back a few years ago the place would have been almost full even on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this little gem while on the way home from the Grand Canyon. While coming through our usual route through Sedona we were looking for a nice place that served organic food. We ONLY eat Non-GMO Organic food. The evening was saved when we found Picazzo's on 89A!!! (Please tell me it really IS all organic non-gmo?!!) 

As a side note: I don't think the chicken is organic so we won't be eating any. If it's not organic, the chickens could be fed GMO corn.

We love to come for happy hour now that we've discovered it...half price appetizers! Of course it would be nice to have a few more 'special prices' besides simply appetizers (& $1off a glass of wine) but it's ok for now. My boyfriend and I get a single slice of pizza ($5.50 average) and 2 appetizers to share. Try the Caprese and the Baked Brie & Roasted Garlic with flat bread, OH YUM This keeps us happy and the bill under $30!

We've been here for dinner and have ordered the spinach salad, very good, and the Margherita Pizza YUM YUM. We have also tried the berry salad which was ok, we like the spinach better. The Puttanesca I found quite tasty, never had it before here.  I'm looking forward to trying some pasta sometime as it looks yummy and the asian salad, as well as the berry bowl and curried broccoli...making me hungry!!

Yes, the food is pricy, but grandma always said ya get what ya pay for! It's not cheap to buy organic food and make it at home either. We love Picazzo's so much that we have begun having our executive business meetings here...and the reviews from our crew have been great! We love to turn people on to organic non-gmo food. Not only is it healthy, it tastes better too!!

The staff has always been great at all locations we've been to (Sedona, Paradise Valley, Tempe) and we look forward to visiting the other locations at some point in Flagstaff and Scottsdale.

The rewards program is a nice addition as well. I'd LOVE to see a location built in Tacoma WA so my daughter could enjoy the fun and I'd have a place to eat out when I visit...ahhh a girl can dream!.

Overall we love Picazzo's and if things continue as they have, we will certainly remain a loyal customer!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 3 and a half stars??? Are you kidding me !? They make gluten free pasta that tastes like gluten FULL pasta. It's amazing. I've been gluten free for the past four years because I am allergic. I have not once until now, found a gluten free pasta that tasted this close to the real thing. It's amazing. Not only do they have good gluten free pasta, but my husband LOVES their pizza. 

Not only is the food amazing, but the service is amazing. Everyone is wonderful there! They're all so accommodating and do a great job at working as a team! I hate when  places don't have the reputation they deserve and this place deserves a very high one. Not only for their food, but equally as much so for their customer service. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wheat-free pizza.  It had been seven years since I had pizza in a restaurant because I couldn't tolerate the wheat.  But here is the best wheat-free pizza you will ever taste.  Great crust, great toppings and friendly service."}
{"text":"Truly amazing food!! So MANY GF choices. Awesome food!! Great service!!! Please come back to Lake Havasu City!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here has very light toppings with an excellent crust and is baked perfectly. Eat here if you aren't too hungry or feel like eating healthy. 

They have a crazy way of serving tea that is guaranteed to burn your fingers. The tea is brewed in a strange glass vessel with no handle alongside a tea cup. No way to get the tea out of the vessel into the tea cup without heating up your fingers. This is the dumbest thing I've ever experienced in a restaurant so skip the hot tea and get something else or bring your welding gloves.

This place has a strangely hipster vibe although the customers were mostly older people. Not uncomfortable in any way but just interesting."}
{"text":"I love the concept. Healthy, fresh, and organic- however if you look at the nutritional guide you will see a lot of salads have a whopping 1500-3500 grams of sodium!

Today I was exremely disappointed. We orderd wings which were cold on the inside and lukewarm on the outside. Good wings should be piping hot.

The cheese garlic bread was a soggy mess with no good flavor. A stronger cheese would help matters along with a crispier bread as opposed to the gooey hunk of goo that was served. The artichoke dip was ok although it was not hot all the way through. The accompanying flatbreads were dismal.

The Caesar salad was ok but very salty and the dressing was loaded with garlic.

Any of these items ordered I could easily make at home- and with better flavor. The soggy bread, salty salads  with cold wings were virtually inedible.

I had I ask the waiter for napkins and then later for utensils."}
{"text":"Simply the best gluten free pizza in the valley. Most other places just use a frozen pre made gf crust (and offer only one size for gf due to this fact). Trust me - I have tried them all! 

We had a large gf pepperoni pizza last night. It was delicious and it was so nice to be able to enjoy a pizza dinner with the non-gf family members and not feel left out."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing positive to say. Ordered the Vegetable platter, paid 9.50 for what tasted like a bag of frozen vegetables, literally carrots cut like it was from a frozen vegetable mix. Absolutely nothing like they were described on the menu. When we addressed it with our server, the response was they couldn't be frozen as \"they don't have a freezer\"....however they serve ice cream. Very disappointing food and response from the server, will never go back."}
{"text":"Nice and rare to find a pizza place that's all organic, not to mention the gluten free options! Split the shrimp and pepper pizza and the honey smoked salmon with a friend, they were both really good and we took quite a bit home. Save room for the apple cobbler, it is melt in your mouth and totally worth it."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! We tried a few different ones and each were excellent and worth ordering again. However, they were severely overpriced - almost $20 for a small! 

I would have been fine paying that had the ambiance been more upscale. The ambiance feels similar to a low to mid scale family restaurant. Additionally, our server was acceptable but for the price we were paying it would have been nice to have some higher quality service. 

This place feels like any other family restaurant but the food is a much higher quality! The food is also overpriced. Go for the pizza (not for the ambiance)"}
{"text":"I went here with my 16 month old son for dinner tonight.  The food itself was quite good.  I had a Greek chicken salad that was nice and fresh and my son had the honey wheat cheese pizza kids meal.  I must confess that I ate a piece of his pizza and the crust was delicious!

My complaints  had nothing to do with the food or even the promptness with which it came out.  My waitress was not friendly.  I asked her for some napkins (with a toddler) and she obliged by giving me two tiny bar napkins.  I got the feeling that she didn't want to be bothered with us because it was just me and my toddler and we weren't going to be big ticket customers.   The other complaint was that there was no changing table in the restroom so it was a real challenge to deal with that.

It would have probably been a pretty good dining experience if you were someone eating without young children."}
{"text":"We eat here often and also have been to the other valley and Sedona locations. This location is closest to us, so we dine here most, but it's probably my least favorite location in terms of food quality and quantity. This location seems to be stingy as far as pizza toppings when we create our own (though better as of late, and perhaps that's due to the new kitchen manager mentioned in a previous comment?), and I find the value for some of the items, like salad, to be pretty poor for the cost. A full berry salad is something like $15, which is pretty astronomical IMO. Some of the servers are excellent, some not so much. 

That said, with my food sensitivities, we are thrilled to have a safe place to eat that tastes great with lots of options to suit all kinds of food preferences and needs. This is really one of the only places we eat regularly, and I've never had an issue where I felt bad afterwards and I trust that they know their stuff in regards to food allergies and what ingredients to avoid. Without Picazzo's, we wouldn't eat out much, if at all, and I'm very grateful to have a safe restaurant for nights out! 

I just wish the prices were a little better, as I don't feel the value is what it should be for the price. If you have a restricted diet, it's more worth the price, but for those who can and do eat anything and everything, I can't imagine paying the prices here."}
{"text":"I don't know else to say other than amazing!!! The hubby and I are new to vegetarian/vegan foods, so we like to check out vegan-organic restaurants and this one was awesome! Flavor is crazy yummy and just the way they incorporated these foods together was so scrumptious! We went for dinner and tried the artichoke dip along with the vegan pizza, so good!!! Yes, the service was a bit slow but our waiter was very sweet. Not a problem at all. We would definitely go again. Overall, try it, dig it, and enjoy it!!! Plus, you can't go wrong with an Organic Restaurant that this place offered! Thank you Picazzo for a terrific experience."}
{"text":"WORST. SERVICE. EVER.  

Today was my first visit to Picazzo's.  i was SO excited, because the restaurant offers a full gluten-free menu, including pizzas, pasta dishes, salads, and even appetizers -- almost all of which are either gluten-free or can be made gluten-free.  I don't get to to out to restaurants much and it is such a treat to find a place that has good food that I can eat.  I was SO excited to go here.  My husband, our young daughter, and I arrived about 11:30 on a Sunday for lunch.  There were 2-3 other tables full in the restaurant-- they were by no means busy.  

Everything was fine until our server arrived -- and I use 'server' lightly, because there was nothing service-oriented about him.  I think his name was Andrew -- and only because at the end, while we were sitting waiting for him to notice that he still had customers and bring us the check and some boxes, a friendly female server came, brought us boxes, and said, \"I'll send Andrew over with the check.\"  He did not introduce himself.  He answered every question we asked about the menu with a single word that conveyed complete and utter boredom.  My daughter asked if he was \"mad at her\" (!!!!!!)  He was uninterested and so unfriendly that he was just flat-out rude.  He seriously did not smile one time.  They do not list the types of sodas on the menu, so we asked, \"what sodas do you have?\"  He looked at us for a few seconds, and then said with disdain, \"Coke.\"  That was it.  The ENTIRE MEAL proceeded like this.  It was laughably bad service -- were we on camera?  It also pretty much ruined what was otherwise a fine meal.  

\"Andrew\" was so amazingly unfriendly and unhelpful that I sat for about 10 minutes debating asking for the manager and requesting another server -- because this was a somewhat special occasion for us and to have it ruined by a guy who obviously didn't respect us, the restaurant, or his own job was just wrong.  In the end, it was easier not to make a fuss -- but make no mistake, I have no desire to EVER go back to this restaurant again, largely because of him.  HE HAS NO BUSINESS WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS.  

The woman who helped us at the end was very friendly, and I am going to try to make myself go back to Picazzo's and just make absolutely sure that I never deal with him again.  Because the food was great and frankly, I don't have a lot of gluten-free places to eat at.  We had the bruschetta appetizer -- gluten-free and delicious.  My husband had the chipotle chicken pasta, which he liked a lot (and he doesn't have to eat gluten-free).  My daughter had the mac & cheese, which was a gluten-free fusilli with alfredo sauce -- very tasty.  I'd order that with some chicken on it any day.  They should sell it on the adult menu.  I had a gluten-free pepperoni pizza (with the raised edge crust) that was delicious -- the best pizza I've had in the 10 months I've had to eat wheat-free.  

The food is a little pricey -- but they are making gluten-free food, with non-GMO ingredients -- to me it's worth the extra cost.  I do wish they had a few 'classics' on the menu.  It's hard to get those comfort foods in a restaurant when you eat gluten-free -- a straight-up fetuccine alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, etc.  A ravioli dish with just tomato sauce and mozzarella baked over it.  What I would do for a good plate of gluten-free ravioli with tomato sauce.  Anyway.  

No one asked us if we wanted desert -- and I did.  But we didn't really have a server, so Picazzo's missed out on our money there. \"Andrew\" literally handed us our check, took our money, and handed it back to us without saying a word or making eye contact.  It was just insane.  I can't believe anyone watching him would think it was appropriate to have him working with guests.  The entire experience -- which was supposed to be a celebration of our daughter's completing 3rd grade and a special treat for me (getting to eat in a restaurant!!!) -- was uncomfortable, a negative experience, and such a huge let down.  What an unnecessary disappointment."}
{"text":"My family has a few diet concerns.  My sister is vegan, my nephews have some allergies and my son is allergic to all top 7 allergens.  We had mother's day lunch at this location and the food was good and service as well.  I was happy to be able to order something my son can eat in a restaurant because of his allergies.  I would have given this location a better star rating but unfortunately, they made a big mistake with my sister's order.  She ordered a vegan pasta with vegan \"chicken\" but as she was eating it, she realized the \"chicken\" was real chicken.  This is a concern because if they had made a similar mistake with my son's food, then, he would have had an allergic reaction.  Good thing my sister did not have any allergies."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm still here - couldn't wait to write this review.  Bad service , bad food , small portions of over priced bad food.  In fact my wife's  dish and my dish were so small that combined they would be a smaller lunch entre at most restaurants.  Cafeteria style salad ,  cafeteria scent in the air as you come into this pathetic establishment.   Ordered lemonade - got crystal light .   If I could give it no stars I would .."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Picazzo's. I have passed this place over a hundred times! I finally got to go in a try it and was not disappointed. I got the lunch special which is about 13 dollars, a little pricey, but your getting the best and local ingredients. I absolutely loved their kale salad, sooooo freaking good! I also got a slice of pizza with it, which was just as good. The lunch special comes with a drink too!"}
{"text":"Butternut squash raviolis were awesome, but the pizza I got for my wife and I to share was not great..."}
{"text":"At this point, I'd say Picazzo's is my favorite restaurant.  I've been there about six times
and it never disappoints me.  Happy hour is great with the (half-priced) Brie/roasted garlic, a fav, and for lunch I've especially savored the lasagna.  The thing I most appreciate is how healthy I feel after I'm done.  Been said before but I wanted to chime in.  Really like!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lasagna bolognese and it was scorched. Instant buyer's remorse.  The lone bright spot was our waitress who was quite attentive and friendly.

We won't be patronizing Picazzo anytime in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Organic and Gluten free yay!  Food yummy most of the time although al dente broccoli is often overcooked.  Would love to see fish on the menu although the new menu offers some nice meals.
Pork cha cha was good as was the spicy chicken quinoa bowl.
This restaurant is a once a week stop for me."}
{"text":"I love Picazzo's!!! If you are gluten sensitive or not this is the best restaurant- give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We come here regularly. Always stellar service.  Bartender Nick is fabulous. Food is always top notch. Sean  and Ryan check in - LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the most fantastic meals I've ever eaten!   I got the Thai Quinoa bowl with chicken and berry dessert.  The Thai Quinoa bowl was so good I was even eating the red cabbage, something I normally can't stand!  The fact that it was so good that I was even eating that was a testament to the awesome flavor!  Wow!   That was my first meal, but I'll be a regular for sure :D  Being gluten free, this place is heaven that I can eat anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We order at least once a week & have everything delivered thanks to azfood.com. Everything always tastes fresh & delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife is Gluten free and so we gave this place a shot around 1pm on a Saturday.  Place was fairly busy but service was still great, we sat in the bar.  My wife had the Mac/Cheese and I had the Thai quinoa, both were excellent!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch here.   We had hoped to lunch at Oregano's but the place was packed so we headed over to Picazzo's.  The place was empty but nice inside.  I ordered a half spinach salad and my daughter had a small pizza, with two iced teas.  The food was good, nothing extraordinary but good.  The service was prompt but the waiter's demeanor was chilly.  I was shocked when the bill arrived...almost $60!  I can think of many other places I would prefer to dine if I want to spend that kind of money on lunch.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Service insanely slow. Not a single water refill. Slowness on multiple visits."}
{"text":"Tastes like a frozen pizza. Salid was better but not great ."}
{"text":"First time here , we sat at the bar seating. I didn't think gluten free would be sooo amazing , the wine selection is great . Fresh and filling. And awesome , attentive staff. I cannot wait to go back !"}
{"text":"I give Beth and her staff 5 stars for the excellent preparation, guidance, flexibility and service for a large event of over 30 at Picazzo's. As always, the food was excellent. But the help in planning and timing in service made all the difference ensuring all in our group a great dinner and social event. Thanks, Beth!"}
{"text":"Gluten and dairy free heaven for me!!!!  So hard to find well made food with my limitations.....Kyla our server is fab...please give her a raise or at least a bonus...everyone here so very friendly... it's  nice to walk in and have smiling employees all over the place....and great tasting, fresh food!!!!..just moved into the neighborhood and will be here all the time.  Just met Kalen, another great employee...you can tell everyone is happy to be here....Great food, great juju!!!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite. Had a great lunch on the patio during the \"lunch rush\" with my 8 year old twins today. We were the only table with children and didn't seem to be a bother at all to the staff. We took our time, food was great service was as well."}
{"text":"I have dined at Picazzo's several times around the valley since it is one of the places my son can enjoy pizza (gluten free). I have always had an enjoyable experience as we both had this evening. My only complaint for this particular location is that the wairtstaff seemed incompotent. For a dinning room with 7 occupied tables there were 3 waiters yet somehow the guests were still neglected? We ordered the medium ultimate pepperoni and my 3 year old consumed 4 of the 6 pieces as I was able to eat 2, the waiter (who never told us his name) came by and asked if he could box up the leftovers???? I ordered 2 glasses of the tempranillo and when the second glass was brought the table was not cleared of any finished dishes. As we always have enjoyed the food we will go back (or do take-out at least) but the service is definatley lacking.  Hopefully the Scottsale/PV location can up their hiring criteria ASAP and make the dine in experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Love the original owners. Use to go here every week but then stopped once they switched owners.....the food became so greasy. Not anymore!!!! The original owners are back and it's so yummy!!!! Made me and my hubby happy. Welcome back!"}
{"text":"One of the only places to get a legitimate organic meal that fills you up.

Got the vegan organic pizza with vegan ranch sauce.  Amazing for restaurant food and I don't ever eat at restaurants essentially.

Make sure to tell them no veggies, though, if you don't want any otherwise they put some on and it was like $10 extra.  Super expensive for veggies.

Other than that, the healthiest option you can find for a restaurant.  And by healthy, I mean organic and not GMO (genetically modified mutant franken-food), which basically almost no restaurant is."}
{"text":"If you put this pizza in front of me blindfolded, there would be no way to tell it was gluten-free. It tasted like pizza dough should... Not like the cardboard that most other gluten-free pizza crust taste like. The chicken wings were big and juicy, and The cheesy bread was delicious as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and mother for Mother's Day. Our server, Kyla, was super nice! The food was great, especially my pesto chicken quinoa bowl! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Kinda pricey, apparently because it's organic and gluten free because it's not for taste or portion size. Service was just ok. I don't know, I know people that like it so maybe I'll give it another try. But I know of plenty of really good pizza places so I don't know when."}
{"text":"We were sat at dirty table. We had a non responsive waiter who not only did not ask us if we wanted drinks but failed to check on us after he brought us our burnt chicken parm and our EXTREMELY salty eggplant parm. My companion had to send her eggplant and salad back because of the salt level.  An entirely unsatisfactory experience. The \"House Made\" Lemonade was worse than the soda fountain kind you get a most restaurants. 

Pricing was far over what you would expect. My Chicken Parm was a super thin, small piece of chicken with a slightly burnt crust and a very small portion of noodles/marinara. For 17.50$ I would expect much more. Its awfully hard to do Chicken Parm badly. It wasn't bad, it was just slightly burnt, undersized and way over priced.

Even the lunch combo my companion ordered would have been overpriced if we had paid for it. This place desperately wants to be an \"upper class\"/\"hipster\" place with its vegan and organic menu's but if that is what they are going for, they need to 1) Deal with their customer service issues and 2) have a much better sense of their food."}
{"text":"Love, love this place.  I have Gluten free friend that has minimal places to go so we are here a lot but it's never boring.  Always plenty of options and love the slice of the week lunch specials!  They are great!"}
{"text":"This is our go to gluten free place to eat dinner! We drive across town 40 min to come to this location. Good food, whether you're gluten free or not."}
{"text":"I have a lot of love for a restaurant that strives for so much local and organic foods. However, I don't appreciate (what seems to me) dishonesty. And I don't enjoy writing 2 star reviews :( 

I bought and ate MANY of their gluten free pizzas thinking that the oil in the mix was olive oil. It says so on the menu (they list the ingredients in the crust). I called and asked too just to verify a while back. 

Well what do you know? My most recent dining there was a big let down. Just for the heck of it I asked what oil is used in the gluten free pizza crust. I like to ask these same questions time and again of restaurants in case there are changes. (That said, the menu still said the crust was made with olive oil on that visit.)

Guess what?

They use canola oil! Oh ... wait... but it's a canola and olive oil blend (that's sarcasm on my part). 

Then LIST THAT on the menu instead of deceiving with saying it's just olive oil. I don't eat canola oil for health reasons because it's awful for you and had I known it had canola I'd have stopped eating there long ago. The staff said it's because it helps prevent the crust from burning. What a joke as our pizza came out burnt in spite of the canola. 

Sad shame."}
{"text":"We thought the service was excellent and had many many options for vegetarian & vegan which is a nice change from most menus. We definitely will come here when in the area again."}
{"text":"I like their salad vortex and fried chicken 
Oh my god the crust of pizza is so so good 
I do hope to come back in the near future"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food as I'm still waiting for a simple salad and roasted vegetables for over 20 minutes. They are not busy. No excuse for slow service.  Not ever coming back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service at the bar by Kim H was terrible. We saw our kale salad sit in the window for about 5 minutes before it was brought out. Then patiently awaited our Uncle Louie's favorite pasta for another 10 minutes which sat in the window to get cold. It tasted great but could have been warmer. Would have been nice if she had checked on us and refilled my husbands beer he asked for. Not until the last 2 bites of pasta did she check to see how we were doing... Too late to have another beer with dinner and ask for another piece of bread. Then took forever to run our credit card. With 6 people at the bar she much have been overwhelmed!!! I'll be back to another restaurant for the food but not this location."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Their happy hour was fabulous (half price apps!) and the shrimp scampi pizza was scrum-diddly.  I would come in for a sandwich at lunch.  All of my favorite things dishes have been altered or removed on the new menu, which is just bad luck on my end of course.  I totally respect the Green/organic and GF direction, but I feel that the changes were a bit too drastic, leaving my mainstream palate feeling alienated.

Came in for the new happy hour, was truly bummed out, since it used to be so good.  Could have understood the narrowing of options, and offering five dollar plates instead of full sizes at half-price, but the new recipes tasted plain awful, and I felt a bit screwed.

First: meatball sliders, served with avocado, Roma tomato, and a basil leaf I believe.  Sounds good, right?  In reality, a real bitch-kitty to consume.  Flimsy bread that disintegrated under the weight of a whole, lukewarm, dry, and practically flavorless meatball, combined with a *wedge* of avocado  - turned what is meant to be a finger food into a fork and knife affair.  The whole thing just fell apart after the first bite, and was tasteless to boot.

Pesto bread: the pesto soaked in to the bread in an unattractive way and was (again) bland, cheese was rubbery in the extreme.  And again on the GF bread, with no apparent options for something else.  I'm sure that it tastes awesome to someone who shits liquid for days after eating the regular stuff, I respect that.  But for me, blech.  Just give the option, please, don't force feed me the compressed crumbs bread.  Had I known better, I would have ordered it on foccacia.  Wish I had been given the choice on the happy hour menu.

Then, the stuffed peppers.  Wish I had known they were SO spicy and SO acidic, my palate was blown out with the first bite, glad it didn't precede anything else, or I wouldn't have tasted the rest of the meal.

Thankfully, the salads are still YUM and would be what I order if I ever return, since I am not a big pasta fan.  My favorite pizza, the shrimp scampi, is now neopolitan style.  Meh, no thanks.  And in my mourning, I don't want to try any others.  ;) Fickle, I know.

Decor is looking a bit matronly at this location.  I always remember the Flagstaff location being much brighter, airier.  This one feels...lackluster.      They obviously had to make some sacrifices in layout due to the size of the space, and as mentioned elsewhere, it feels a bit odd, even dowdy.

The feeling emanates from the staff as well.  All skilled, polite, and hardworking, don't get me wrong, but not lively at all.  Service is efficient, but not engaging, at least not for me.  GM is nice and gets the job done well, but always seems stressed.  

One thing that put me off on my last visit - I mentioned my disappointment at the disappearance of the chalk-board happy hour, including $5 martini Thursdays, and my server's tone was borderline rude in replying.  She treated me like a rube, which I don't appreciate.  They had a good value for the guest and they took it away, probably because it wasn't making them any money, I get that and respect their change in direction.  But don't be rude to a semi-regular who is inquiring nicely.  Just smile and shrug, point out the new stuff, don't act like I am a chinz for asking.

I guess this just isn't my kind of place anymore.  The happy hour was really what brought me back and it is boring and flavorless now.  The organic thing is awesome, guys, but it still has to taste good!  

They are catering to a niche market, I hope this suburb can support the location.  I love local businesses and hope they succeed.  Good luck and farewell, Picazzo's."}
{"text":"I have ate at many locations. But this time this location the service was horrible and the food was secondhand at best. The salad was brown and tasted terrible.  Although the offered to bring us a new one they refused to remove from our bill. We were trying to enjoy our lunch to be rushed and have employees beyond rude.  Cleaning table while we sat the refusing to refill our drinks. I will never eat at this location again.  The staff is young and very unprofessional. Left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least."}
{"text":"We were in town to visit my grandmother, who has Celiac Disease. This place was such a nice change of pace for her, because she can pretty much order anything on the menu without worrying about gluten! The wine was great, our food was so very good. I knocked a star because we came from LA, and I was pretty shocked to see that it was just as pricey or more than something comparable in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sedona location. Always enjoy. Definitely not a every day thing because it can get pricey but when I want down really good pizza with great ingredients without the crappy feeling after I come here. Great tiramisu also. Not to sweet, not to soaked. Totally just right!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is a little bit of noisy but other than that it's a great pizza spot. They have plenty to choose from the menu but it's a bit pricey overall it's a great place. Will definitely be coming back with my husband. Our waiter, Cara was very helpful was really nice!"}
{"text":"This 2-star is deserved. I have experienced better. I've experienced better Picazzoses for that matter.

There are a lot of enthusiastic reviews on here. Mostly because people who must eat gluten-free for health reasons have a severe lack of restaurant dining choices, and are very grateful for any that exist. On the other hand, I feel there is a need to evaluate a restaurant based on its food, service and ambiance, and not upon my elation merely at having a GF place to eat.

Last night was just nasty. This Picazzos location has screwed me twice now on their (un)happy hour: half-price appetizers and $1 off glasses of wine. This makes most apps $5 and most wine glasses in the $6-$9 range. Happy hour ends at 6pm.

The last time I went, we were seated at 5:50. The waiter showed up at 6:03, and told us that we couldn't have happy hour specials because WE were too late. I requested a manager and got that straightened out. 

Last night we weren't given happy hour menus or even told about happy hour. I had to ask. My belief is that this location would rather not provide happy hour, but are forced to because they are a franchise. 

This time we got there at 5:25 pm, early for dinner, few people in the place. We ordered apps and entrees and wine. The waiter brought out app plates (sans apps) about 10 mins later. And we waited, and waited for our food. Meanwhile, other parties entered the restaurant, were seated, ordered and received their food. Our waiter was nowhere to be found. The one time he walked by, I gestured for him, and he walked by, his eyes less than 4 ft from mine, without acknowledging me.

25 minutes after ordering, I tracked him down. His response? \"Your food will be right out.\" I elaborated, \"I'm concerned because it has been a long time already. Other tables arrived after us and are already eating.\" His response: \"Your food will be right out.\"

10 more minutes went by. No food. Waiter came by. I nearly yelled at him - \"Where's our food?\" He said, \"It will be right out.\" I said, \"No-I want an explanation and an apology why we don't have any food. Everybody in this restaurant is eating except us.\" The waiter contradicted me yet again, claiming everybody was eating salads and they're easier. What the hell was this guy's problem? 

Our apps came out about 40 minutes after ordering. The weird thing is that they were both very overcooked - chicken wings were dried out, shriveled. The artichoke dip was congealed from heat, and everything was incredibly hot. I'm going to guess that a cook forgot our apps in an oven.

Two minutes after our apps came out, our entrees arrived. My friend's ravioli looked good and he said it tasted good. My lasagna bolognese was a travesty: Separated sauce all brothy and sloshing 'round the serving plate, overcooked/heated lasagna, dried out cheese, small portion (about a 3\" x 3\" square), weird chunks of ground turkey strewn about (but not mixed in with the sauce). Bland flavor, no meat, no tomatoes, no herbs, vague cheese, could not find any filling between the lasagna layers - it looked like stacked noodles.

There was a new type of bread on my plate. At one time this place served regular and GF bread. So I asked. \"Is this gluten-free bread? I don't recognize it.\" Response from the dreadlocked, nose-pierced waiter? An eyeroll. Why? I asked nicely and I am concerned. He then said after a beat, \"All the bread is GF here,\" with a tone of \"you should have known.\" But they changed the menu and no, nobody told me. And his snotty attitude made me concerned that maybe he didn't really know what he was talking about. Nothing like rudeness to cause your customers to lose faith in your restaurant. 

This place isn't cheap. Especially their pizzas, which are in the $20-$25 range for a medium. Dinner for 2 was over $50 - 1 soft drink, 1 wine, 2 happy hour priced apps, 2 entrees. Rude waiters don't do it for me. You don't have to be my friend, but there was way too much dismissive behavior among the waitstaff here. People who must eat GF are going to ask questions about the food and they deserve polite responses. And everybody deserves better food and service than are available at this location. Get yourself to any of the other Picazzos locations or Buon Gusto in South Tempe."}
{"text":"I have Celiac Disease and they definitely have great options for us gluten-free people. Great pizza, pasta, and even gf ravioli! So much better than any other gluten free italian dishes I've had. It can be a little pricy, but definitely worth the extra bucks."}
{"text":"Our waitress was cute. I really have nothing else to say about the place. It's organic and what not. Which is cool. Ya know, if you're into that. Personally, I wish there were more hormones in my food. What happened to the America that I used to know and love?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go here all the time. We love the gluten free pasta and pizza options. The food is really good; you wouldn't know you're eating gluten free pasta. They also have a decent beer/wine selection"}
{"text":"Super accommodating, friendly, delicious, this little neighborhood restaurant is a gem. Levi our server was very knowledgeable, the hostess was so nice to allow us to change seats... 3 times. I know... Food is great, correctly priced."}
{"text":"We have been going to the paradise valley Picazzo's since it opened and it is one of my favorite places for lunch or dinner, any day.  The salads are exceptional, and the pasta (especially the mushroom!) and pizzas are wonderful.  I like the fact that it is organic, and that you can pretty much design what you want.  The servers (with one remote and fortunately gone exception) are very responsive.  This place is successful for good reason.  I hope it remains open for a long, long time."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Tried it out for the first time one person in our party is allergic to gluten and everything is gluten-free in there restaurant! Everything was so yummy looked great on the table and the wait staff keith was so fun and very helpful. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.

Loved the hummus platter!!"}
{"text":"This review is from march and was posted on the wrong Picazzos. 


Such a disappointment. I've enjoyed picazzos in Sedona and tempe and even the cactus location and the food and service quality has always been fantastic. Today we went in at 1230 with 5 people. The restaurant was more than half empty but I only saw 2 servers. They were extremely understaffed for what these servers could handle. It took 7 minutes to be greeted and took 20 (YES TWENTY) minutes just to get our drinks (all fountain drinks or waters.....) it took 15 minutes for an appetizer and our food arrived much later than that. When our food did arrive one person didn't even receive theirs. So disappointed. The waitress blamed it on the \"new cook.\"  No apologies. She never came to check on how the food was. And now, 3 hours later all 5 of us are suffering from some form of food illness. I have been in the restaurant for years and if I preformed how the staff did today I would be fired on spot. Such a waste of a beautiful location and gorgeous restaurant. Shame."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Organic delicious salads and pizza. Also has great gluten free options."}
{"text":"Just a note: Restaurant.com is working with Picazzos -- we used a gift certificate and I will totally be back.

The pear/walnut salad was delicious -- we ordered a medium for six of us, and it was just right. 

We also ordered 5 pizzas because we wanted to try so many things. The lamb/chevre was my favorite, and the sausage/pepperoni was my second fave -- I loved both of those a lot and will definitely order them again. The BBQ chicken was good as well, I'm told, but the California pizza was somewhat bland. The plain cheese was quite tasty too. I liked both the thin crust and the traditional.

I love that my friends who need to eat gluten-free can eat almost anything here!"}
{"text":"Best vegan pizza in Arizona! I wish there were some of these restaurants in California because they are so good! Everything here is organic, and they have Daiya which is a non-dairy non-soy cheese that is delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Great food that is GMO free and gives the option of gluten free. Very diverse menu, not just pizza and pasta options. I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone and always bring my friends and family here."}
{"text":"I've frequented both this location on Cactus, as well as the on on Scottsdale and Frank Lloyd Wright (Bell) since they both opened. Truth be told,  I've always preferred the Scottsdale location, and while the menu is the same, I've noticed the Scottsdale location was faster and more consistent in their food.  I'll NEVER set foot in here (Cactus) again, and here's why:  October 22, 2014, I went here with my 7 year old and my Mom. We arrived at 12:40, and by 12:45 we ordered. We watched another table get their food (who arrived after us), and so I asked what was the delay. The waiter said he'd \"go and check on it\", and by 1:20 we still didn't have our food, or an explanation.  (Keep in mind, the lunch rush was pretty much over that day,  as I counted two tables on the patio, and perhaps two more inside with customers still eating.) So, here I am with a hungry 7 year old and mother who's diabetic, and NEVER expecting to be waiting over 45 minutes at this point for food.   Ok. Things happen. Orders sometimes aren't entered in, I GET that.  I assumed someone either forgot to put in our order, or someone forgot to cook it, so I asked for some bread.  An easy request for an italian restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter). The waiter disappeared, and 10 minutes later, still no bread. I asked where it could be, and he said they needed to BAKE some.  What was inexcusable was that he was completely indifferent, not interested in correcting the terrible service, and the manager who came over was equally inept and unapologetic. My kid is awesome and patient, and so is my Mom.  I worked in restaurants many years of my life, and so I think I'm more forgiving than most but this was it.  We got up, walked out, and went over to Oregeno's across the street and proceeded to get top-rated service and food from these guys.  The reason Yelp is fabulous is you can have a head's up on what to expect at businesses. Just know what to expect here."}
{"text":"The pizza was much better than I expected. Pretty good crust, tho nothing like my NY favorites. Above average service. Great caesar salad. Now. There's just no easy way to say this. But the meatball appetizer gave me the wind something awful. I'm sorry, but you should know that."}
{"text":"Food - Four Stars
Service - One Star
(Averaged to three stars)

Stopped by for lunch late in the afternoon. The restaurant was almost empty so we were expecting good service. We decided on the lunch specials which included Salad and drink. Upon ordering, the waitress took the food order and left promptly before asking what we would like for the included drink. When we captured the waitresses attention to request the drink for my wife she rushed away and brought the one drink to the table fro my wife without asking what we would like for the other included drink. I had to request that drink to go as were almost done by then. Everything seemed like an inconvenience to the server waiting on us. Then we were brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else such as dessert which we were planning on but decided to forgo because the service was lacking.  

We were just being rushed through the meal experience! We think they had the bartender waiting on tables during this down-time for the restaurant between busy meal times.  

Will come again for the Organic food but hope the service is better next time."}
{"text":"Excellent salads, great pizza with healthy options. This place is pretty good, and I don't usually say that about restaurants that have more than one location. This may become my go-to place when I don't have the energy to make a salad (I detest washing greens) and really want a healthy dinner."}
{"text":"The margarita pizza is awesome. They use a delicious red sauce that I would be happy to eat on noodles- much different than a lot of pizza places that just use a tasteless red goo. Good crust too! The organic root beer is pretty gross though."}
{"text":"I legitimately cannot get enough of this place! Organic, GMO free, fresh made - DONE!! I love having the option to eat healthy when I'm out. This is the perfect place to do just that. Their salads are incredible, their pasta is wonderful, their pizza (I usually do the gluten free) is great too!"}
{"text":"\"Picazzo's?\" More like \"van Garlic.\" We had the hummus/dolomades appetizer which was WAY overwhelmed by the taste of raw garlic. And the puttanesca pizza on the organic whole grain crust. Again all I could taste was garlic.  Not that I have anything against garlic, but three days after my Picazzo's experience I am still quite vampire-repellant. Service was not great (even though the place was practically empty) and I thought everything was overpriced. Props for the Classic Chocolate Chip cookie/ice cream dessert, though, that was delicious."}
{"text":"My family loves Picazzo's, my folks eat there once a week. Out of any restaurant I've been to in the valley this staff provides the best customer service. We always eat in except for picking up gluten free pizza dough to go. If you are eating gluten free this is the best place for pizza I have found since they make the dough themselves. The texture is as close to regular pizza dough as possible. 
The menu is full of options for parties who's tastes varies from gooey cheesy noshing to clean eating.  The Spicy Uncle Louie is delicious, for drinks their sangria is great and the cucumber bay breeze is so refreshing.  If you're looking for something new to try or are on the fence it's a must. If you want a go to spot with consistency in the food it's easy to become a regular here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and desire to eat every meal I can hear because it is so healthy and the juice bar is phenomenal.!."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza was good, but not worth what I spent on it! Outrageously expensive, FYI kids meals are tiny & $15-18 adult meals are small portions- don't waist your $. Overpriced fancy Tea was horrible. 2 kids, 2 adults I ordered 3 entrees- $80+ with tip NEVER again organic or not. Way over priced. Don't waste your $ here..."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable!  I ate lunch there today and the gluten free menu was awesome!  I had the lunch combo which included a slice of gluten free pizza, a salad (I chose the Asian salad) and my drink all for $9.  The gluten free pizza was to die for!  I have been to so many places where the GF pizza tastes like a sponge.  It almost tasted like their crust was made from a potato flour and was a little on the sweet side.  The portion of salad I received with my slice of pizza was rather generous.  It was definitely enough to fill me up for the price!  I highly plan on going back here and trying their gluten free pastas!"}
{"text":"Very good organic and gluten free choices. The bolognese sauce is also fantastic, and I recommend the putanesca pizza lunch combo with salad and beverage. A great deal."}
{"text":"Am a fan of Picasso's.  We go there probably close to at least 1-2 times a week and they notice that when we visit each time.  I almost always get the berrylicious salad with chicken.  The chicken is so yummy, but the feta and glazed walnuts, with the strawberries mixed in, makes it the best.  Have had the pizza and some other pastas, too, which are also very delicious.  The prices have gone up with their menu changes, but we're willing to pay for the organic meats, etc.  Definitely a place to check out if you are in the mood for some pizza!"}
{"text":"Love Picazzos but paying $18 for Chicken Picatta and getting 5 tiny strips of chicken is not worth it! Used to give at least equivalent of a full chicken breast. CPK gives 3 pieces of chicken! Good Bye Picazzos."}
{"text":"I would definetly recommend eating here. I had the very berry salad with shrimp it was excellent. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"My mom took me here for lunch a couple of weeks ago. I like how their menu is set-up for lunch. You can choose pizza or pasta, then a salad and your drink for a standard price. There are upgrade items available. I stuck with the basics at the bill was 10.95 plus tax and tip. 

For my entree I choose the curry chicken, mixed green salad and green tea. The food was excellent. I choose the balsamic dressing, which was way too thick for my taste, but it had good flavor. I also enjoyed the tea. 

My only complaint is the service was friendly, but slow. It seemed to take forever to take our order and to get our food."}
{"text":"Favorite for years. Still make it a point to come back when I visit Phoenix for a slice of puttanesca."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, and visited again recently and it was as good as ever! Their lunch specials (salad & pizza) are delicious, well-portioned, high-quality and very fairly priced."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time we stay in Scottsdale we eat here at least once a day. They have fantastic gluten free pizza my favorite is BBQ chicken. Also they have many corn free options and the food is so fresh. The staff is fantastic. And they are open."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and got right in. Had Chicken piccata which might have been too oily for some people but I loved it. Lots of capers! The chicken wasn't breaded, and was in bite-sized pieces, but tender and good. The small piece of bread on the side - even though gluten-free- was delicious! I upgraded my side salad to a wedge and it came chopped up -- unusual but very good. Had apple crisp with vanilla bean ice cream in a skillet for dessert and it was outstanding. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was slow even though we were there before a crowd.  Ordered a Caesar, which was a little on the fishy side, pizza, and a pesto pasta which had so much liquid in the bottom of the bowl it was more of a noodle soup.  The pizza was decent and the staff was courteous.  Won't return."}
{"text":"I just moved back to area and had a wonderful dinner with a friend from ca who is not into chain restaurants. They do have limited seating I think it adds to the charm. They offer a wide variety of wine and OMG the pasta is to die for my friend had Thai pasta that was amazing as well. We had great and thoughtful service I will be back for sure !!"}
{"text":"The Vortex... What a great Pizza. I have always loved the gourmet pizza idea and my third time having the Vortex pizza was just as good as my previous two times. I don't have a whiny reason to rate these guys lower than a 5 Star review. WA..WA..WA... I read some of the less than stellar reviewsof Picazzos and I can tell you that in my five times of eating there I have been absolutely happy evey time... Try it you'll Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is nothing less than incredible and the service is wonderful. Melissa is fast , very helpful with recommendations and takes great care of her customers. Anybody with food allergies should consider this place their little slice of heaven. We travel 30 miles one way to eat here simply because they are the best."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with my daughter and her family. The restaurant was clean and the seating was comfortable. We sat in the outside patio. They do have a good kids menu selection. The food and service was disappointing. I had the lentil soup and a salad. The soup was nice and hot in temperature. The olive oil served with the salad was dark in color and I believed it to be a blend (not Pure olive oil) or poor quality. The server was not friendly or helpful. I thought the prices were high. Did not see value for the money spent."}
{"text":"I will visit this place for Prickly Pear Margarita again and again!!! Also, love their food options and flavors. I had Spicy Thai Curry Pasta and still drooling for it :-) I was not a big fan of Gluten free garlic bread with Marinara but Heart Healthy Gourmet Salad was fabulous! Yes, the place is a little expensive but all worth it for good Organic scrumptious meals."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner, although we weren't that hungry we split 2 appetizers and a salad.  The garlic bread was OK, but probably won't order that again, not for me.  Also had the Aritsan Bruschetta, (1) mascarpone, mozzerella, dates, carmelized onion and roasted walnuts - yum.  We also split a gargonzola salad, that was excellent.  Service was great, ambiance was nice and will continue to eat there."}
{"text":"Yum! Great lunch spot - food and atmosphere are spot on. Not just an average pizza joint, it has a nice feel.
Great selection of pizza and salads. My personal favorite is the blue cheese wedge.
Service is great and food arrives in timely fashion."}
{"text":"I love the Sweet Potato Pie (pizza). Some good healthy options, but still quite expensive. Staff were friendly and overall positive experience."}
{"text":"Never disappoints!  From the super friendly and efficient staff, to the many choices for me as a Vegan, to the delicious food and comfy atmosphere, this is my fave place to eat in Phoenix!  Eating well and healthy is so easy here...and they have so many options, combos and reasonable prices.  Try it and thank me later:)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant by any standards! Phenomenal when you learn its all gluten free... (Most tastes like cardboard but less appetizing). 

We went for family that have eating restrictions, but this place (while entirely gluten free) and can satisfy other dietary restrictions like dairy and vegetarian etc, isn't as annoying as a crossfitting, helicopter pilot, vegan. In fact, you'd never know if you didn't ask... Almost like a normal restaurant. I've now tried 5 of their meals and they've all been really good. 

Our server with blonde hair had celiac's herself (as stated above this wasn't volunteered until questions were asked confirming the place was safe/suitable for family members) and she was awesome! Not only a good server in her own right, but very attentive to kids and made amazing recommendations of not only what to eat at the restaurant but outside the restaurant as well. 

Try this place and try the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my mom, the thai quinoa bowl and zo's salad were amazing! Ask for Zane too, phenomenal service!"}
{"text":"I used to love this organic, gluten-free Italian restaurant.  something drastically changed. We arrived for an early dinner on Father's day about 5:30.  The heavy metal music was so loud I could not even here my dining partners conversation. Totally inappropriate for dinner music or an Italian restaurant. Felt like we were more in a nightclub than a family restaurant. When we complained to our waitress, she said something to the manager and it was turned down, but heavy metal music remained until 6 pm."}
{"text":"great gluten free place. And I finally got to eat garlic bread again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last Saturday for lunch and, as usual, we thrilled with their salads; always fresh and great portion sizes. The slice of pizza I got with it was not quite as fresh, but we also had the baked Brie app which was delicious. They had half-price apps and drinks while we were there (late lunch - 3pm) so I also ordered the Cucumber Basil Breeze cocktail which was amazing! You have never had anything else lik it. Check out the photo I uploaded.  Lindsay was our server and she was lots of fun. Great experience...we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am not celiac but I do eat 90% organic, that means mostly home cooking. So happy to find a restaurant that I feel good about. I find it hard to make good pizza at home so glad they can do it for me. We buy it par-baked so it comes out of the oven fresh and hot in Payson. Thank-you Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for dinner. We ordered waters and drinks. The waitress brought my beer but not my daughters' drink. She remembered in about 12 minutes. I had the Shrimp Scampi and my daughter had a pizza. We enjoyed our food.

We happened to be in Sedona a few days later and they have a restaurant there also. We stopped there just before leaving the area. It was really good. They were very busy but the waitress did say that she would be \"right with us\". My daughter had the Pesto & Ravioli ~ Sun-dried tomato, goat cheese, vine-ripened tomato, organic spinach. I had the Avocado Delish ~ Elbow pasta, tomato, black olive, garlic, lemon zest, avocado,
served warm. Both dishes were great!  

I would also like to say that the Manager/Owner of the one in Sedona shouldn't be folding Pizza carry out boxes! He needs to be focused on the customers instead. Maybe have all the servers/employees fold 10 each before leaving their shift. 

I'm giving this a 5 star as the food was really good. Maybe a little help in waiting on tables, but both places were busy. You might give it a try. We definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Picasso's is one of my favorite places and one of the 10-20 restaurants I eat on regular rotation.  The staff is super nice and they go out of their way to make sure your needs are met.  I am dairy free and gluten-free and there are incredible options.  Make sure you have the gluten-free focaccia bread because it is amazing.  Their gluten-free pizza and pastas are great and my friends who do not have any food sensitivities usually order with traditional ingredients which are not gluten free but are mostly organic.  There also have very affordable lunch specials.  You have a lot of options if you are vegan and for friends who are not they have plenty of great choices for carnivores."}
{"text":"Delicious Caesar salad- I have even started eating the kale Caesar, which is amazing! They are really good about asking about food allergies, which is nice for my gluten free friends."}
{"text":"From the staff to the food, this place is AMAZING! As someone with serious food restrictions, I am incredibly grateful for the care taken in making certain my dietary needs are addressed. There is no risk of contamination. I have never walked out of this restaurant sick or dissatisfied with the meal that I've had or service I've received. If you are looking for amazing food that is amazing for you too - with a team of wonderful people taking care of you - THIS IS THE PLACE!"}
{"text":"Just the facts...per restaurant staff....the food is not made to order...it is premade (which I suspected based on the taste). There are a limited number of sauces which are shared among all plates. While there are a number of lovely dishes, be reminded you are eating at a franchise, the food is not prepared to order and in my opinion it is overpriced. That said...the pizza is fantastic and I would go back for it but I know I'm paying $17 for a pizza, I would not order any pasta plates and I'd be a fool to have a family meal there and expect to pay less than $200 :-)"}
{"text":"Way over priced...I'd rather have DiGiorno.
$18 for a 12\" pizza...bah, go to Grimaldi's and you'll be way more happy; they actually use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm vegan and I always feel like there are plenty of options. The food is very fresh and I appreciate that they have soy chicken as well as vegan cheese. The dessert is great too! Service has always been excellent and I never wait long for my meal. A little pricey, but it's quality food."}
{"text":"We have been steady customers of Picazzo's since my last review and the menu has gone though a couple of changes but the quality remains the same!

I have been sampling their GF pizzas, the California, Sweet and Sassy and the Fig Gorgonzola - all excellent (better in the restaurant than take out but delicious either way).  They put the artichoke bottoms back on the appetizer menu and I love those though I think you need to have your own stash of corn chips for the dip.  The stuffed peppers are really good too.

Cesar salad full size is huge with a very creamy and substantial dressing, the chicken on top (if you order it) is like a deli thin sliced chicken, delicious but unexpected - my husband thought he was getting a grilled chicken breast.  I tried the chopped kale salad tonight, it was perfectly dressed with a very light oil/vinegar/lemon dressing - fabulous!!

If you're looking for healthy, creative salads, and GF options, Picazzo's is your place."}
{"text":"Loved it.  My first time I ordered three items.  The hummus dish is wonderful, the salads are fresh and tasty and the pizza was so good.  I will be a returning customer.  The menu is has a huge amount of selections for everyone in the family - adults, kids, gluten free etc."}
{"text":"We love this place. Linda is great. Excellent glutten free pizza at a good price. We will be back."}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy! So many different good vegan options too, definitely will be back... all the time! Very chill, laidback vibe."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  We used to go here quite frequently and could order scrumptious pizzas of all kinds . . . then they became \"organic\" and quite frankly, the pizza left a lot to be desired.  I'm all for \"organic\" and healthy, but then I still expected the same taste and quality and I was seriously disappointed.  We ordered the meat-meat-meat pizza and it was tasteless, with very little sauce, hardly any cheese. I guess when I'm in the mood for pizza, I'll have to trek all the way down to the Borgata to get me some Pomo."}
{"text":"We had a disappointing first experience, with inattentive service and so-so food. With above-average prices diners expect more. It may depend on what you order. We had the truffle-infused mac n cheese -- blah. Salad came so lightly dressed there was no sign of the dressing, so we chased down a server to ask for more, he actually went to check with the kitchen to ask if there was dressing on it, then reported that there was and left. Had to hunt down another staff member to request dressing on the side. We split the entree and when the server brought it he asked if we would like clean plates or if we could use our salad plates. Really? No sign of our server when we needed her -- but she was quick to clear the table before we were done eating. We sat outside and the traffic on Tatum was too loud to converse.  Not so good."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé literally just walked out and was so good I felt the need to review. The menu is all gluten free and anyone who has had both knows you can't taste the difference if the chef is good. And let me tell you the food was superb... Amazing pesto pasta. Yes it is a bit pricier but it's all organic and gluten free, that means everything takes more prep and the ingredients are. More expensive to begin with. Our server was amazing. She already knew the soup of the day and refilled our water right away, even though our bill was small and we split a dish she never made us feel any less special. I made sure I compensated that in our tip ;) hope this place does well so we can come back soon!!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were seated right away.  We sat there 5 minutes without any acknowledgement or greeting.  I started my Stop Watch and it was another 4 minutes when we decided to get up and proceeded to the host stand. I  asked to speak with a manager.  Another few minutes later and a manager stepped up and we described what had transpired.  No apology, she made excuses, so we decided to leave.  I have dined here many times, the food is very good.  The service today was unacceptable.  If there is a next time we'll order online and take it To Go."}
{"text":"It seems this chain is grasping at trying to remain relevant.  People who have been here before revel in the old days when it was about good organic/natural pizza, made on a thin crust, not commercially formed, with great choice of sauces, red or white or none at all.  That was then... Today, the whole menu is so overboard with Gluten Free, I believe they even advertise their water as being Gluten Free, that it's impossible to understand... If you are part of the .75 % of America that is Gluten Intolerant, then this is your Restuarant of choice.  The other 99.25% might find it easier to dine elsewhere.  The regular \"Gluten\" menu is however, very good.  I personally tend to prefer the thin crust, coal fired brick oven type of Brooklyn Style pizza, so this place is close, just not the same, and they do have a good choice, once you get through the Gluten Maze."}
{"text":"I went to a meetup.com called \"Freaks at the Table\" it's for people with food sensitivities and allergies.  I have a TON of stuff that I can't have.  It was so refreshing to find a place where there is a pretty big menu of stuff for me to choose from.  From the moment I walked it, it smelled amazing.  I wanted to order an appetizer, a pasta dish and a pizza...there was so much to choose from.  I ordered the Free-range chicken pesto pizza and it was DELICIOUS!  I'll definitely go back again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and if you're watching your gluten or have a sensitivity, the menu is incredible."}
{"text":"very good ingredients (organic), the pizza is tasty but priced a little on the high side.  They have an extensive gluten free menu so if that's a concern this place has a lot of variety for you.  If organic ingredients and gluten free offerings are not important to you then another place would probably be a better fit."}
{"text":"Best bartender  in Scottsdale. Nick remembers our wine and pizza standard orders even if we haven't seen him in months. Always friendly and super with customers.  Plus the food is great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and awesome food!! Also amazing for us gluten free people!! Nice to be able to eat everything on the menu finally"}
{"text":"i took my mom here b/c we're both gluten-free. there is a novelty to getting to eat stuff that is typically off-limits for us...but the pasta was boring (i thought). i had some of mushroom pasta thing. she had the shrimp scampi. to be honest, she loved it...but i probably won't go back...it's a long drive for food that didn't blow me away..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a dream come true for me (dairy-free) and my husband (gluten-free). We love the staff, the decor, the ambiance, and oh! did I mention the food?! The Vortex Pizza is our absolute favorite and for desert, the giant chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla coconut ice cream and chocolate sauce!  Picazzo's uses organic and locally grown produce, another plus for us!  We recently moved out of state and we miss this restaurant so much! I think we'll go to AZ on our next vacation just for Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much that I'm writing this review in the parking lot! The food was so fresh and the service was spectacular. Jackie was very pleasant, personable, and attentive! We had the Veggie Galore and Nonna's Favorite. Both were phenomenal! I was happy they carried local craft beers, as I am here on vacation. Our experience was refreshing and satisfying. I highly recommend this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Had the pear / mixed greens  salad  & asian style pizza...both good choices.  Many different options & selections available.  Recommend.  Staff attentive."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  We had the spicy Thai quinoa bowl, eggplant Parmesan and tomato basil soup.   Fresh ingredients and very flavorful.   Menu has a lot of variety.   Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"A very healthy Italian option! My wife got the zoodles and turkey meatballs and absolutely loved them! I got the Mac and cheese and it was also amazing! Great cheese bread too! Lots of great options!!"}
{"text":"This will now be my go to for Italian food.
The food is fresh and delicious. 
The staff is very friendly.
And the decor is fresh and new!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that has me decided to not eat out anymore.  I didn't feel so well after eating there.  I also noticed that their highly advertised \"Queen Creek olive oil\" didn't really taste like it (that's the oil I use at home.  So I asked if they use ONLY 100% QC olive oil.  \"Oh yeah, I think so\".  Well after grilling various workers 3x the waitress went in the back.  She came out and said they use the olive oil in a \"blend\".  It is blended with canola oil.  NOT organic canola oil, either.  Now, canola oil (aka rapeseed) is the MOST heavily sprayed with pesticides crop there is.  It is also likely to be GMO unless it's organic.  This leaves me to wonder what other cost corners they're cutting, and telling little white lies about..  I won't be back."}
{"text":"If the pizza was as good as the service, they would have a line out the door. Wonderful service last night and enjoyable community table experience. With deal was legit, but the pizza dough was bland and the bottom had a burnt taste. Desserts were average, but thank goodness a great server made up for it."}
{"text":"I'm scheduled to meet two friends at Picassos for lunch. I arrived first and there was only one full table in the restaurant. I asked to be seated by the window where there were two empty tables and the hostess said no. It was the other servers turn and her side of the room was not near the window. I suggested we sit by the window and let whichever server wait on us. The hostess refused. I have no desire to eat here. The food might be good or not, I don't know. I don't like their service and service is at least 50% of any restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this restaurant has one of the best staffs in terms of quality service I have ever seen. My servers name was Mark and not only did he steer me in a good direction for food selection but he was also funny ,smart and genuine. I came here for a Saturday lunch with a friend  to try out because a friend told me they can cater to my dietary needs. Just starting on a diet recommended to me by my doctor I sat down in a bar table and was greeted promptly. After introduction and receiving my  delicious lemonade ,Mark looking at my face obviously saw the confusion of me trying to read the menu and make a decision. He asked what questions I had and how  he could be of help to me. I told him the diet I was on and he replied that he reads about nutrition outside of work and knows exactly what I could eat. Wow.. A server who genuinely cares about their job and what they are serving. He told me not to even stress about it and gave me a couple suggestions from which I made my picks. The food came out and Mark told me to enjoy and that he will be back in a minute to ensure I liked my entree.  It was delicious. When he returned to check on us he didn't even ask me he just said your welcome and proceeded to chat and joke around with us. I myself like when someone is confident in their ability to please a guest and his joking demeanor was even better. It made me feel welcome from the second we walked in the door. The rest of the staff a woman waitress and a male busboy were equally engaging their tables with conversation and it just felt like everyone who entered the restaurant were family to this group of wait staff. I myself have never seen a busboy talking to customers and making them feel welcome. It's refreshing to see young people who actually care. Thank you for the stellar experience and the good fresh food, I will return and also tell my friends."}
{"text":"We have found a brand new go-to restaurant. This is probably the nicest place. They have a great Happy Hour menu and they make a really good pizza!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love and appreciate this place! I was overwhelmed and surprised by all the gluten free options. From pasta to pizza to soup to cheesy bread! There is a satisfying amount of choices. I chose the pasta Bianca and was not disappointed! The portions are smaller- just enough to finish in one sitting and my plate was around $14. The staff is very friendly, and they use all locally grown organic vegetables. I definitely recommend Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"It's weird how into the organic, gluten free, vegan thing they are here, but I guess that's the premise.  Food was okay, lots of good lunch options.  Pasta was gluten free and was better than expected, the chipotle chicken sauce was heavy and creamy and knocked me out afterwards.  Nothing that special though."}
{"text":"Great food. Kind service and a very warm and inviting atmosphere. Try the eggplant appetizer it's awesome."}
{"text":"The shrimp scampi was horrible. There was no sauce, no seasoning and virtually dry. The shrimp seemed like they were previously frozen and not prepared at all. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with amazing food and service. It is nice to finally have a great restaurant with healthy gluten and vegan options. Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable. Everything we have had there has been amazing!
They have great happy hour specials and day of the week specials too!"}
{"text":"We are a family of 6 that have gluten issues and we are vegetarian so this place is perfect!
The staff is awesome as well, we eat there at least 4 to 5 times a week every week, the food is amazing and service is great, they make us feel like family!! We eat at this location and the one at Scottsdale and Frank Loyd Wright."}
{"text":"First let me say I love Picazzos, my family and I frequently eat at both the P.V. and the Scottsdale locations. The staff is always awesome, The food is delicious. My request (not complaint) is that y'all would serve more vegan options, like different types of vegan cheeses, and vegan meatballs would be awesome. My whole family is wanting to go Vegan, I already am due to health reasons and also moral reasons. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Gluten-intolerant friends... there is hope!  Almost the entire menu here is gluten-free, save for a selection of pizzas.  Other common dietary restrictions could be easily accommodated here too.  

We started off with gluten-free cheesy garlic bread.  Not being of the gluten-free variety myself, I am not used to the taste of those bread products and I couldn't get past how much different it tasted than I expected.  The rest of my table seemed to enjoy it though.

For my entree, I ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli in Creamy Gorgonzola... yumm!  I love the squash raviolis, and I tasted no hint of the gluten alternatives in the pasta.  The sauce was creamy and flavorful, and the whole situation was on top of a bed of spinach, which complimented nicely.  I am a huge fan! The hubs had Pasta Bianca and I only tried a bite, but it was also excellent.  

Our server was good, though nothing to particularly write home about.  He didn't mind that we stayed to chat for quite some time after settling our bill, mostly I'm sure because there were plenty of other open tables at the time.  

It seems like the lighting was a bit dim if I remember correctly, but the ambiance was a nice typical \"restaurant\"y feel.  We didn't notice the juice bar in the front until we were on the way out!

It was a great meal, a good place for good conversation, and I left feeling stuffed and happy... just how it should be!"}
{"text":"I'm suprised by the negative reviews of this place.  I'm a first-timer, so I can't compare it to the restaurant of old, but I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch.  I had the combo consisting of an organic ceasar salad and a slice of the spinach and mushroom pizza.  Both were amazing!  I'm not a fan of ice cold lettuce in my salads.  The temperature of the salad was perfect.  The dressing had a nice flavor and wasn't over done.  The pizza was delicious, left me wanting another slice.  I also enjoyed my organic pomegranate limeade.  Though it was poured from a can, I'd never seen this beverage option before.  Tasty!

I really appreciated the attentiveness of the server.  She was super friendly and even offered me reading material, as I was dining alone.  I'm definitely a fan of Picazzo's.  Repeat."}

{"text":"The WORST dining experience of my life. My salad was like a left over from the '70's. Some wilted lettuce, mushy chunk of avocado, a couple of apple chucks and topped with mushy tomato slices. Bottled salad dressing. Hubby's ravioli had a white sauce that reminded me of a home economics class in high school.
Moving along, the acoustics in the space are horrific, so there is a cacophony of noise assaulting you throughout the meal.
Top it off with a table of the most ignorant young couples who thought that their children's scccreammmming was the cutest thing since hand to hand combat. A good restaurant knows how to politely and diplomatically tell unruly customers that they are disturbing the other diners.
Just because they stick 'organic' in their name does not give a restaurant the right to cook very badly!!!
When I told the waitress this was our first visit, she said nothing in the way of introducing the restaurant to us."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff are always pleasant and willing to go the extra mile for you! The manager  Steven is awesome, he always welcomes you with a smile! :-) I always feel welcome here! 
My favorites are the Lunch special pizza and chopped Italian salad, the wings Italian Style, the Baked Brie  appetizer and the Caprese salad! Their pasta is awesome! I have been coming here 5 years and have never had a bad meal, ever!  It's organic fresh and gluten free! Definitely come and check this place out, I promise you will not be disappointed!  :-) Ask for Kala, tell her Barb sent you!"}
{"text":"As a person with a severe allergy to gluten, this is the only place in the valley that I trust 100%. It's definitely on the pricier side but I am willing to pay that for the quality of the food! I eat at Picazzos at least once a week because of it. Yum!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite pizza places and we would order from the one in Sedona but I would say it's not that impressive anymore... Pizza was cold and doughy!"}
{"text":"After a promising response after my previous yelp review, I was pleased to see them reaching out to reconcile the poor service I received at the restaurant.  After 2 months, I have not received the alleged giftcard.  Would have been nice to use that giftcard to give them a second shot, but I guess not."}
{"text":"I've been trying gluten free restaurants lately so this was a must.

let's start with the decor, this place is super nice (not in the fancy/pretentious way, but in the casual, comfortable, cool way).

The service was also pretty good and the prices are not that bad, I mean, not cheap at all, but manageable. 

We had the garlic bread, avocado delish pasta and build your own pizza. 

I know this is going to sound funny but the garlic bread was too garlicky lmao. The EVOO that came with it was pretty tasteful. 

The avocado delish pasta had also way too much garlic and the pasta lacked flavor. I was expecting more avocado (since that's the name of the dish) but there were just hints of it. If they ask my opinion, I would toss more avocado with a zest of lime juice and cayenne pepper to give the dish some personality.

The pizza was the best part of the dinner (besides the company, of course). If you're not gluten free, the pizza might taste weird but still pretty good (I'm not GF, just in case you were wondering).

For desert we ordered the apple cobbler but they were sold out so we ordered the cookie which was pretty good.

I'll go back to try other dishes for sure.

Cheers.

PS I'm curious about the name. If they named the place after the painter, I'll feel compelled to say that he was Spaniard and it's spelled with two \"S\". Just saying."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I appreciate the tasty gluten free, non-GMO options.  Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.   Portions were generous and my lasagna was hot first bite to the last bite"}
{"text":"I had the wedge salad that was very good. My husband had pasta, I dont remember which one.. he said was just ok. 
Next time we need to try the pizza.
The service was good."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh ingredients, Awesome selection, everything on the menu is gluten free, and last but not least good sized portions. Staff was very friendly. Even my Mom that never likes to eat out liked it."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We got right in and seated quickly and it wasn't super crowded, which was nice. I'm sure if it gets busy it also can get loud due to the lack of soft surfaces in the restaurant, but for us it wasn't. I appreciate the large selection of organic, non-GMO options they have on the menu. Several dishes also have option to make it vegan, which I'm sure is helpful to many people who visit here. 

Checked into yelp and received an offer for free Tiramisu, huge plus!! I ordered there bigoli and meatballs, made with turkey, and it was very tasty. At first the portion size seemed kind of small, but this is a healthy joint so maybe that's a good thing. By the time I was finished though it was plenty and I felt satisfied. The food did take a little longer to come out, but it wasn't terribly long or anything. I'll wait for quality ingredients/food. 

Overall, tasty food, quality ingredients and a nice atmosphere. We will for sure be back! 

Update: After coming here 3 times, I've decided to update this to a 5 star. The service has been excellent and every item I've ordered has been delicious. Really really liking this place"}
{"text":"What a great place!!!  Organic, fairly healthy, lots of good tasty options, including a rice and tapioca pizza dough that was just outstanding.  The salads are outstanding, fresh, and cleverly put together.  The service is also quite good.  Try the pasta dishes too, as both the chicken piccata and lasagna were Fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Organic, Non-GMO and gluten-free, vegan options? I'm in heaven! The pizza tastes very good. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot EVER!!! The staff and food are OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing!!! It feels like you are at home with family every time you stop in. And it's not like there are only a few good things on the menu, ALL of their menu items are incredible. Don't let the \"healthy\" aspect of it turn you away, because it is the BEST tasting food!!!!!"}
{"text":"I gave the two stars for the food-it's pretty good for being gluten free. 

HOWEVER, the service? Awful. 
The hostess was nice, but that's about it. We aren't quite sure who our sever was...it started out with one obnoxious girl who barley paid attention to us when she took our drink order...she kept looking everywhere but at us, it was super awkward. To top that, I asked her a question and she was so busy not paying attention that I had to say \"excuse me\" twice to get her attention while she was standing at our table with her pen and notepad out!! Luckily my boyfriend and I can laugh about this stuff. 
After she took our drink order, another waiter came about 20 minutes later to take our order. 
We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer and a pizza to share. We waited and waited. And waited. Drank our drinks...waited. It took about 30 minutes for the chicken wings to come out, the pizza came out a minute after that. 

So, we had each eaten about 2 wings and just as I took one slice of pizza off the platter, our waiter comes over and asks \"do you guys need a box for all that?\" It caught me off guard for a second...really? We just started eating. I sad no thanks and went on...10 minutes later \"can I clear your plates guys?\" about 5 minutes after that \"you all finished?\" He kept lurking around our table, I could see him continuously looking at us... I almost asked him if he could just let us eat our pizza in PEACE but I'm too nice for that. 

Anyways, our bill came out to $40 (not including tip) and our original waitress brought it to us then took about 20 minutes to pick it up. Needless to say it was the slowest, most obnoxious dinners I have ever had and I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza - wonderful salads - also fresh and tasty. I hope to eat there again when I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our daughter has Celiac disease. We have eaten at the Scottsdale location countless times & never had an issue. We visited the new Union Hills location & my daughter has been sick for 2 days now. We suspect cross contamination with the pizza. Very disappointing! Not sure if we will return to this location. I hope they will up their standards/ precautions like the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"I just recently came here for the first time and I keep coming back. I really love this place! The lunch special is great for a decent price. You get a slice of pizza salad and drink. There are more choices like pasta as well. The green tea is so refreshing and delicious. I also came with my boyfriend for dinner. We got the brussel sprouts to start and split a pizza and the kale salad for dinner. It's been delicious every time!"}
{"text":"This place is a touchdown for the west side.  Get this, chick food that dudes love.  It's like watching Fried Green tomatoes and someone pulls out and Uzi and starts blowing stuff up.  My wife makes me order the Cucumber Basil Breeze which made me feel like I was the color guard at a pride parade.  The catch is a hulk of a human made it and made me feel manly for ordering it. Plus it was soooo dang good I ordered two.  Then the guy sitting next to me says \"I will never eat wings at Hooters again\"!They're baked wings looked incredible!!! Meanwhile I'm eating freakin gluten free Avacado toast and thumping my chest like a Viking warlord because it's delicious and the perfect compliment to my Italian White Bean and Kale soup.  Mind you I'm a 6'4 235 lb flesh eating silver back. This place is seriously fantastic and I haven't even tried what I came here for but my wife wouldn't let me have, PIZZA, (High LDL don't judge), it's  obviously the main attraction.  Sharissa is my bar tender/server and she is funny , kind, professional, and endearing.  P.S. if you give this place a bad review I will fight you!"}
{"text":"Great vegan options!! The sweet potato pie is delish! I add sauce but that's just my preference, still good as is! It is a little pricey but still worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza is so good!  We sat at the bar and Nick took good care of us.  He even made a custom drink for my friend.  Would definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"So happy that Picazzo's is back on the scene in the NW valley. Great place for non GMO, locally sourced and gluten free AF food. Great pizzas, tasty quinoa bowls, fantastic pasta, soup... It's hard not to find something on their expansive menu. Healthy eating for everyone!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed... Used to go here once a week for lunch. Pizza was soggy the chipotle pasta use to be my favorite they changed it from rigatoni to elbow pasta and totally changed the sauce. It is no longer cheesy and creamy. It had little to no flavor. The only reason I gave it 2 stars bc the Italian chopped salad was good even though less toppings then in the past"}
{"text":"The sun was shining, the breeze was blowing in the air, and my granddaughters who LOVE pizza settled down with their mother and I to eat the most disappointing pizza we have ever consumed.  
We ordered Picazzo's pizza excited for a gluten free menu.  However, after paying $50 for two pizzas and one salad, we felt totally ripped off.
The cheese on our pizza was like chewing on my dog's squeaky toys- flavorless and rubbery.  The tasteless pizza sauce was doled out the size of a thimble- and we wondered- \"How can this pizza that looks so delicious taste like nothing at all??\"  If I am gonna pack pounds on my hips indulging in pizza- Well, dangit! I want to enjoy it! My granddaughter who normally eats pizza like she's a pro wrestler refused to eat more after her first bites.  We told her it was magic pizza- that it would give her special powers- still she wouldn't bite.  She was right- this pizza has no magic whatsoever.  Next time I give away money for nothing- it's gonna go to the guy holding a cardboard sign on the corner!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what is happening to Picazzo's.  I've been going to the Sedona and the Scottsdale locations for many years and have enjoyed their food immensely so when the Tempe location opened, I was so happy.  well I tried them and it's just not the same. I tried their salads and the lettuce was browned and wilted. I tried their pizza and it was soaking in oil I couldn't even pick it up with my hand because it was falling apart it was so greasy. The waiters and managers were very attentive and everybody was just super nice and constantly checking up on the guests, however the food was not good at all. I must say I am disappointed :("}
{"text":"While the place is nice looking and the service is ok, the produce buyer should be fired.  The past 4 times I have eaten there, and have ordered the same salad, the greens have been on the rotten side, this includes the cherry tomatoes and cucumbers.  I am not returning for a fifth time."}
{"text":"I love the selection here! The quinoa kale bowl is my favorite. The soups are delicious and we have always been pleased with the pizza selection and quality. I will say the tiramisu at AJ's or whole foods tastes better though."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! They cater to so many allergies and since I can't have gluten or dairy, they make it possible to eat pizza! I'm so excited I discovered this place"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere but it was was Kael that made our experience beyond a typical restaurant night.  He was cordial, knowledgeable, witty, fun and not over bearing with an infectious positivity.  Excellent experience overall.  We will be back and we will recommend to everyone.  Congrats to management on hiring superior talent."}
{"text":"Highly over rated. The salad was drenched in dressing which wasn't even good. We were never offered another one. The waitress later said oh yeah I should have mentioned the dressing should be on the side because we always use too much. The pizza crust was soggy. The one star is for my drink which took forever to get. If you want a 30.00 pizza which is so not worth it go here. Otherwise stay away."}
{"text":"I don't know what I'd do without this place! It's not just that Picazzo's offers gluten-free food; it's that the gluten-free food is delicious. The service is outstanding too, and it's nice to sit out on the patio on pretty days."}
{"text":"I definitely would not recommend this restaurant. In fact I would recommend not coming here, because they have some of the worst service I have seen.

I visited with a bunch of people and it was my first visit. This restaurant doesn't seem equipped to handle large parties. The seating arrangement was uncomfortable, but the real problem was that we had a waitress who never checked on us. I was unable to get a refill for my meal, which really bothered me. I was then offended that they automatically charged us an 18% tip. That is unacceptable considering that she never checked on us at all.

The prices are pretty high. My wife and I paid about $50 and we didn't really get a lot. The food itself wasn't bad and is the only reason I give this place a slightly higher rating, but I still feel that they ripped my wife and myself off. I have written to this place telling about my unsatisfactory experience, but have yet to receive a reply and I doubt I will. Avoid this place. They care nothing for their customers."}
{"text":"I was so excited to be in the neighborhood and drop in here. It's been a while since we've been there, but always loved it. Tonight, I walked in and caught the end of happy hour. Decided to order a glass of wine (excellent) and the garlic bread, since I thought my daughter would like it. The drinks came out quick...then...the \"rush\" hit, and .the wait game begin. After seemingly like forever, our appetizer came out, but only not the garlic bread but the warm brie. I should have taken that as providence and kept it...but...didn't. Much later, the garlic bread came out. Honestly, it was so not worth the wait. it was for the most part totally unmemorable. It needed more garlic or some flavor. Waited. Waited. Waited. Finally our dinner came out. My pizza was just short of cold, on the luke warm side, so i'm guessing that it had been in the window for a while. My daughter's pizza was super steaming hot. She did the kids Hawaiian, and that was pretty tasty. Mine had a good taste, but cold pizza just wasn't overly appealing. Saw our waiter several times, but never seemed to be able to get his attention, so the wait game begin. I finally asked on of the other servers if i could get our bill. I'm really hoping that I caught them on an off-night. I love having something organic and gluten free, and I'm even willing to pay more for it. i just wish that the taste and service were like they were the last time I was there (believe was Buon Gusto then)."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there yesterday with friends. Had a lovely table outside. They have a couple of bird feeders just beyond the fence which we think keeps birds from bothering diners. Nice to watch the bird varieties. We all had lunch specials which arrived after a bit of a wait but then again it was the height of the lunch hour. Gluten free pasta noodles and lasagna were wonderful. Sauce in eggplant parmesan was too sharp  like tomato paste.  This was my second time there and we won't go out of our way to return although we are very impressed with their emphasis on healthy options."}
{"text":"Went here in search of a good gluten free place for my bff that has a severe gluten allergy and has been looking for a place. The wait staff was very attentive and was very helpful and knowledgeable about her dietary needs. We had the gluten free focaccia with our caprese salad and it was amazing; to watch my besties face light up to eat tasty bread again was worth its weight in gold. She ordered the pizza (made in a specific gluten free oven) and was delighted to have enough for left overs for later. I had an amazing spinach salad. They have lunch specials for the gluten free patron. It was a good time. Plus the check in on yelp lead us to a tasty gluten free treat. I am glad I was able to find a place for my bestie to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen for the first time last night.  We ordered one of the spicy thai pastas and the brussel sprout and bacon pizza to share so we could try both one of the pastas and one of the pizzas.   
The pizza came out first - overall I would give it a five out of ten.  The reason being the brussel sprouts on top were not cooked enough, so we were biting into the soft ingredients of the pizza yet had big crunchy brussel sprouts in our mouth.  I assumed the brussel sprouts would be shaved on the pizza not served chopped in big hunks.  Okay, moving on.
The pasta came second.  The menu advertises the pasta as being served \"al dente\".  Rather, we got a bowl of mush. Secondly, who ever made the pasta put so much curry in our dish it was inedible.  We love Indian food, Thai food and Mexican food, so spice is not an issue.  But a balance of spices is key to a good dish.  If I would have had my eyes closed eating the pasta I would never guess there were other ingredients in the bowl, everything tasted like red curry  powder/paste.  Awful.
We flagged down the waiter and told him the ingredients were off.  He recommended another pasta bowl which we noticed had peas in it.  We told him my husband was allergic to peas, and he said that he would tell the kitchen to leave them out.  So, we agreed to try that pasta dish instead.  You guessed it, it came delivered to our table 15 minutes later loaded with peas.  We waited another 7 minutes to show our waiter what happened.  He said he could not believe it, he even \"told them not to put in peas\".  
The second bowl of pasta was also no where near al dente - moving the spoon to see all the peas determined that pasta was very over-cooked also.
So, there you have it folks.
We were at the restaurant for 1 and 1/2 hours only to leave with left over pizza in a cardboard box we would need to heat up at home because the ingredients were not fully cooked through at the restaurant.
The restaurant is VERY noisy, screaming kids, the tables are packed together (we could hear the conversation next to us).  If you want to have a private conversation, not the place to go to.
If you want to have a nice, quiet evening together enjoying wine and your meal, not the place to go to.
Oh, and let's not forget, both the men's and the women's restrooms were out of commission.  Something wrong with the sewer or plumbing, so there were signs on both doors indicating they could not be used.
Made us wonder - how were staff washing their hands in the kitchen if the rest rooms were out of order with plumbing issues - it is all connected!!   
Needless to say, we would not return."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always delicious and great service. I had the slice of the day which was veggies with traditional red sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil. Plus, added a cup of their white bean kale soup...so good on a Fall day!"}
{"text":"After a long day and for kicks my wife and I decided on Pizza and figured that we'd go to Grimaldis. Unfortunately it was a 45 minute wait and we were starving so we decided to go elsewhere. Bad idea. Now I've been to this place a few times and so getting in and seated wasn't a problem, especially for a Friday night. The food is usually quite good and the pizza is excellent. 

Whilst the food is good the service was absolutely lacking tonight. Don't know if that's a common practice for this establishment but we got seated and after about 8 minutes still hadn't been acknowledged by any of the wait staff or given any water. My wife hadn't eaten since 9am, and it'd been about 7 hours for me. We weren't exactly in a mood to be ignored but we were. Three waitresses passed by us and nothing. NOTHING! What on earth is going on here? 

So we got up and left....

Then the hostess thanked us for coming in and I thanked her for not serving us. We're starving and we decided to go home.

Papa Johns delivers and he's never let us down.

Take a lesson Picazzos....get your act together or give up the ghost."}
{"text":"Picazzo's  is a number 1!!! Everything has gluten free choice!! With a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices including: pizza crust , chicken and chips , linguine and meatballs, etc.  Their desserts are AMAZING!!!!! With my favorite cookie and coconut ice cream. Their commitment of happy customers is outstanding!!!! Their waiters are  very welcoming, and are always glad to help! So, I gave a 5 star review for not only a neat design, but also amazing food and kindness!  I totally recommend this exceptional family- friendly restraunt!!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for their advertised happy hour, which was stated on the internet as well as a banner out front that it was 4-7pm.  We got there at 6:10pm, sat in the bar.  The waitress walked right past our table, no greeting.  The bartender, no greeting.  After sitting there 15 minutes the bartender came by, again no real greeting.  Handed us menus.  I verified happy hour and he stated 'no that ends at 6'.  I told him about the sign, he shrugged it off and just said 'no, it ends at 6'.  Seriously?  I would never spend my money at a place that doesn't greet you and does not address their false advertising.  Amazing this place stays in business!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. They have the best salads and delicious pizza. I especially impressed with the quality of food- organic and gluten free. 
They changed names for a while but kept a very similar menu . I'm delighted to have Picazzo's back in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Holy de-lish! We love Picazzo's and we don't have to feel guilty about it because most of the menu is gluten-free and at least semi-healthy(ish). All of the pastas and salads are extra yummy. For desert, try the sundae with Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream and organic chocolate mint syrup. Yum!

Everything is delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely one of my favorite local chains in Scottsdale. Naomi Garnice gives it five stars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I went with my girlfriend. 
We had A great time together. 
This place is lots of fun. 
Great menu. Good and healthy food.  Pizza. Salads. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came to this location in Tempe after visiting the Picazzo's in Sedona.  I ordered the Puttanesca Pizza (no olives) with Garlic Butter Crust again because it really is THAT good!! I think the crust was even better this go 'round!  The Chocolate Chip Skillet with Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream is great and big enough to share!  We enjoyed sitting outside on the beautiful outdoor patio on such a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"The Sprint store next door recommended we eat here as we were switching out our phones and Sprint needed us to kill about 1.5 hrs while they did their downloading/transferring process with the new iPhone 8's.

If you're wondering why there are no pictures it's because we were phone less during our meal.

We came to eat at about 4PM today and the place had only a handful of diners in the restaurant. We were seated right away in the main dining hall and was greeted by a very nice waitress. Not knowing what to order our waitress walked us through the entire menu from salads to pizza to dessert. I love dining in a place where the staff is actually very knowledgeable in what everything tastes like and knows what's good with what.

After 15 minutes we decided to start with the Crunchy Asian Salad and then split a small pizza.
What was really cool was that our waitress suggested we split the pizza in 2. So we did just that. One side was the California and one side was the Vortex.

Let's start with the Crunchy Asian Salad, the lettuce was nicely and evenly coated with the yummy sesame ginger dressing, the chicken a decent portion and nice and tender and the crunchy stuff just perfectly spread throughout the salad like the way it should be. Everything about this salad screamed delicious by just looking at it. The best part was that it was more then enough for two people to share one order.

Then the best part came, the pizza that we split into different types...All in all it was a total of 6 pieces and believe it or not, I was kinda worried that one type of pizza would overwhelm the other side but this was not the case. It actually complimented the two different flavors.

My husband LOVED the Vortex and I loved the California pizza. I have eaten all over the world and never ever had avocado, gorgonzola and spinach and bacon on a slice. There's something sacred about eating a thin crust pizza that has salad ingredients as toppings. I don't know what it is about this combination but it was just perfect in every single way. From the crust to the way the cheese was perfectly melted to the freshness of the avocado, this pizza was so perfect I wanted to order one to go.

As far as the Vortex, my husband said his pizza was so good he didn't have any left to take home. Rarely do we ever eat all the slices. Most of the time we take home up to 4-5 slices but with the pizza here we inhaled them.

To date in AZ, this was the best pizza we've ever had...

Now the journey of our meal was not over yet because when I checked in with Yelp, I found out that the restaurant was offering a free tiramisu or NY style cheesecake.

Was I excited or what?

At this point, the slow eaters we are, we were heading into the 1.5 hours territory and the General Manager then took over our table as our waitress had to start serving the diners starting to pour into the restaurant. 

Throwing caution to the wind and with the recommendation of the General Manager, we chose the...get this...the gluten free Tiramisu. One word = HEAVEN. What a way to end the meal. My hubby and I gobbled up this white luscious yummy dessert that literally was melting in our mouths. Afterwards we wished we had gotten two orders. Next time.

I am so happy we stumbled upon this place because coincidentally my two favorite pizza places in the United States are both called a version of Picasso (my favorite artist too). So now besides having to fly across the country to eat at Picasso's Jacksonville, I now have something closer to home.

From excellent service, to restaurant cleanliness to FABULOUS, TO DIE FOR food, this restaurant is 5 star all the way. Excited we know about this place now as we plan to be coming back here as there are so many other things we still need to try."}
{"text":"We came around 2 PM on Saturday and we're looking forward to a nice relaxing meal. The restaurant was half full and we were seated in the area adjacent to the bar. As soon as we were given our menu by our hostess, our waitress didn't appear nor greet us for another 10 minutes as she was busy serving what seemed like the entire section we were sitting in.

Our waitress was a nice enough gal but when she greeted us her eyes were darting all around the restaurant as she was taking our order. Our order was simple, one water, one Diet Coke and we were going to order the same exact thing we had the last time we were in.

When I told our waitress to please spread out the time frame (15-20 minutes) between the Asian salad and our small pizza, she indicated she understood and proceeded to take off to get our drinks. Five minutes later, she came by put down a glass of water and rushed away before I could tell her she forgot my husband's Diet Coke.

As soon as the salad came, I asked her nicely for the Diet Coke and we proceeded to start on our salad.

The salad we got this time wasn't as robust as the last time we were here. In fact, my husband asks me if he thought we were being shorted on the salad. Mind you the salad was $11.95, and any time we've eaten here, we've always been told it's enough for two. That was not the case today. We ate the salad and it tasted fine but we did feel it was light on the two things that matter most, the lettuce and the chicken. While it tasted the same, we had to savor every bite as the salad's portion this time was definitely just for one and not two.

10 minutes and some conversation later and 3/4 through with the salad the pizza arrived. We had to slide over our salad to make way for the pizza. I thought for sure we would have time to digest our salads but this was not the case. Before I could say anything to the waitress about the timing, she slid away to a mysterious place unbeknownst to us, as she was not visible in the dining area.

We were dreaming about this pizza and couldn't wait to taste it again.

My husband had a bite of his slice, the Vortex, and he said his was just as he remembered. 

My side was the Californian and right when I took it from pizza platter to plate, I noticed the crust was wet. There is nothing worst then wet pizza. I lifted up the other 2 pieces and noticed that the crust was not crisp and was wet.

I looked up to see if I could catch the waitress' attention but again she was nowhere to be found. Normally at this point I would try to find someone else to call but there was nobody around so I just sat.

After I ate my first wet slice, I had to wait 10 minutes until I was able to flag her down. As soon as she came over I asked if she could reheat it and again she took off.

Once the pizza came back, it was nice, hot, and crisp, just like it was last time. At the end of the meal, since I checked in with Yelp we got a free tiramisu. No complaints here, it tasted as good as the first time.

Overall as far as dining experience, it was not what I experienced before and maybe it was the time of day, new people cooking or the management wasn't around and had gone home for the day but for a lunch at over $40.00 including tip, I just expect better.

And if you're wondering if we tipped, even with the mediocre service due to our distracted and absentee waitress, the bad timing of the food and the wet pizza situation we still tipped her way over what was deserved.

Pretty disappointing Saturday lunch experience and would like to return once all the above is fixed."}
{"text":"Gluten-free, vegetarian, or you just like good food this is a fantastic lunch spot with great prices for the quality and great service."}
{"text":"Clean eating was making it hard to decide where to eat out while traveling. I really liked this little place. Not a huge menu, but what's on it is good. 

The lunch combo was perfect! Salad or soup with entree or pizza and drink. Not bad. I had chipotle chicken with brown rice pasta and salad. Enjoyed it very much! 

Can't wait to come back next time I'm in the area and not eating healthy so I can give the pizza a try."}
{"text":"Are here for lunch based off a friend's recommendation. It was great. My cousin would love this place because of her egg and dairy allergy. My lunch combo came with a soup or salad and a drink. I got black tea and a mixed green salad with house vinegar write. Portions were perfect. Tasted good and healthy!! My pasta came with bread that was toasted but no butter. I ordered the Thai peanut fusilli. It came with chicken,peas, carrots and almonds with the fusilli pasta and sauce. Yum! 
Also, got appetizers because you get something for checking in with Yelp! 
Service was speedy, efficient and pleasant! I really with I could have taken advantage of the bar. The sangria looked amazing. They do have a happy hour that I will have to come back and check out."}
{"text":"I love that this restaurant offers delicious organic food!  We are trying to eliminate GMO's out of our family's diet, and wanted to order pizza last night.  I thought we were going to be out of luck, but I was so happy to see that there is a pizza place like Picazzo's out there.   Way to go Picazzos!  Our pesto chicken spinach artichoke pizza was awesome, and chemical free!  Woo hoo.  If only they delivered, we'd order from them once a week!  I used the delicious deliveries service, but you know that always ads an extra cost.  We will definitely be regulars anyway.  It would be great to see more and more restaurants follow in Picazzo's organic footprints."}
{"text":"Setup of restaurant is a bit odd. When seated in main dining room there is a 3/4 height wall separating tables from service line & the television is mounted on wall behind service line making it impossible to see bottom half of the screen. Their ice  machine backs up to the 3/4 wall & our table was right against the wall behind the machine so we had to listen to the fan or motor running throughout our whole meal.
No where near the atmosphere of the Sedona patio location. 

Their hummus had way more garlic than the picazzo's in Phoenix - too much for me but SO loves garlic so he was happy to eat it all. 
Service was very quick even for refilling the water glasses. 
Berrylicious salad was verry berry yum. I could eat it for dessert. I wish I'd taken a picture of it, it was so good, lots of walnuts, berries & oranges. So much more flavor than the kale & berry salad I tried yesterday at Nourish. 
I just wish the gluten-free crust was vegan  & didn't have eggs so I could enjoy it, especially since they carry vegan cheese. But I scraped the veggie toppings off & SO ate the crust which he loved - thinks it is even better than \"normal\" pizza. He really doesn't mind being gluten-free & the  vegan cheese but now that he's tried this pizza I'll have to be satisfied with turning him vegetarian instead of vegan, at least while visiting in Picazzo territory. Still a vast difference from the eat everything diet of 6 weeks ago. He's eating way healthier & saying it \" are you sure this is healthy? It tastes too good to be healthy\""}
{"text":"I'll be honest love your food. Being gluten-free and knowing I'm not limited! Awesome! Your service isn't my fav but tonight I dined alone at the bar and was very pleased.  Great service! Don't know his name but know I'll be at the bar next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok learned the trick go on Tuesday sit in bar area. Service is better. Also half priced wine!"}
{"text":"Their chicken wings are excellent and rival, if not exceed, the chicken wings of restaurants that tout themselves as \"wing places\".  Not only that, they bake their wings.  Try the buffalo maple wings.  They have just enough heat to go along with the sweet."}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch in this area. The service is fast and friendly, the food is spectacular, they don't mind nit-picky orders, and I love all the organic and gluten-free options. Seriously great pizza, pasta, and salads. And the restaurant and bathrooms are super clean. My favorite place to take clients for lunch. Big shout out to the servers who are always going above and beyond"}
{"text":"I'm not going to make this long but this place is bad.  I don't know how old the waitress was but she was more concerned with talking with someone at another table than doing her job.  There were only 3 tables being used with my wife and I at one of them so there are no excuses.  The food did not taste very good at all.  After a couple of bites we paid our bill, left no tip, did not ask for a box to take home and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best.  We love this location for the people and the food.  They are like family; they have never messed up with our allergies, they are sweet to my kids and the food is good.  I consider this place to be like \"Cheers\" for the celiac crowd.  This is by far my favorite location."}
{"text":"Having had a bad experience at this location we have been frequenting the PV location instead, where we generally have better luck.   However, we agreed to give this spot another try when we met friends recently, and our experience was much better.  The food  and service were both better than  when we were last here a few years ago.  The deserts, however are the reason for the increase in stars, as they are fabulous, and having become much more sensitive of late, it is a welcome change to be able to eat any desert (without fear or reaction)."}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been to in Arizona. It took them about an hour and a half to bring us the food, and they ended up bringing the wrong food.

I didn't eat there of course, so I'm not sure if the food is good or not but all I know from my friends  it wasn't worth the wait.

Advice: go anywhere but there."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that picazzo's was coming back to Tempe.  It changed names/owners for awhile and now it's back.  They offer organic, gluten free, fresh Italian food.

They have a good happy hour and 1/2 off a bottle of wine on Wednesday!  

The dinner menu is a little pricey, however you're paying for quality.  They have a great lunch special which is very reasonable!  The food is made quick and you're getting a generous portion of food!  

Recommendation trying:

Kale Caesar
Hot Artichoke Dip
Brie and roasted pepper
Diavola pizza
The vortex pizza

I haven't tried the desserts, but I heard the pizza cookie is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Literally just walked out after being seated and not being acknowledged. I had time to count that there were 6 tables occupied and at least 3 wait staffers who walked by us numerous times. When one waitress started to clear a table of people who had just left instead of asking for a drink order, I turned to my husband and suggested to leave. This is probably our 4th or 5th time there and the second time we've had slow service even when it's not busy. I don't care how good the food is, if you can't acknowledge your customers, I don't want to eat there.  If management reads these reviews, you may also want to train your kitchen staff to not use a glass when scooping ice into the glass, another thing I noticed while waiting for someone to take my order. As we were leaving, the waitress clearing the table looked up and saw us leaving, but sadly, didn't care enough to see if there was a problem. Ok, whatever..."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! I absolutely loved the berry salad & chicken cordon blue specialty pizza!! The night was Perfect!!"}
{"text":"How is it possible the pizza taste THAT good and its Gluten free? Stopped in the other night for some pizza, wings and wine and was pleasantly surprised.  Not only is the food delicious but the service was great. The bartender didn't mind our 21 questions about the menu or wine. After a few bottles of red priced just right ;) (half off on Tuesdays), extra crispy wings and Neapolitan pizza we were greeted by the general manager. Couldn't have asked for better service or food from this Tempe neighborhood gem! We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  I ordered the scampi no taste,  all I could taste was the oil & the 4 shrimps that came with it.  Portions are small."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour on Tuesdays and Saturdays- half off bottles of wine, discounted cocktails and appetizers. Food is also very healthy and very delicious! I got the fig pizza and it didn't disappoint- the Gorgonzola was to die for!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for what we had.  Spinach artichoke dip was disappointing. Good service, food was hot."}
{"text":"We expected this to be a good place. It had a decent amount of people, was very clean, and hip. But nothing we were served was much better than Village Inn. The salad had wrinkly old tomatoes and we had to pick out the bad lettuce. The lasagna was nothing special, and the pizza was under cooked. Oh, and they served Pepsi. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch and a few times for dinner.

The pizza has  always good, not great, but the service is always kind of slow. So don't go if you are in a hurry. I appreciate the fact everything is organic so that edges it up above all the other basic pizza places.  Since it's organic the price is definitely higher than most places."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had.  We were sat and then it was 15 minutes before any server even said hello.  In the meantime, the table next to us was sat and was half way done with their beers and salad before we even got our drinks.  On the other side of us another family was sat in our server's section and after 10 minutes they asked us how long we had been waiting. They got up and left and not the manager or the hostess said one word to them.  After waiting 50 minutes since we put our food order in, I asked the hostess to please ask our server to just bring our bill. I told her I'd pay for everything but we are leaving. The server just comes out and says the drinks are on us, sorry we only have one oven and it's still going to be awhile for the food.   The manager just avoided eye contact with us and we left after our wasted Sunday afternoon with our two hungry boys and ate somewhere else.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here.  I've also brought many out-of-town guests here for a casual lunch and each of them have really enjoyed it as well.  Service is friendly, food is fresh, and the atmosphere is very nice.  My wife and I particularly like to have the lunch combo.  They frequently have a unique pizza slice of the week, and I've always been a fan of their Greek salad.  There rigatoni is great, too, as are both of their soups.  This has become one of our top options (if not the top one) when considering a quick, light lunch in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Whenever we visit Phoenix (2 or 3 times a year) this is a must stop restaurant for us.  We love the patio and the happy healthy hour can't be beat.  Luke was our server this time.  He offered great suggestions, was quick and efficient.   We had cheese bread, pizza, and a zoodle bowl.  All delicious and huge portion size."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The gluten free pizza is amazing and the kale salad is wonderful.  You can also find them in Sedona.  Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family mid-week for dinner and my experience was a little average. The host was able to seat us as soon as we entered the restaurant, which is always good when you're hungry. The server was very nice, and the food came out promptly.

The food was decent. I ordered a pizza with grilled onion, pork sausage, and basil. For 100% organic food, it was good! I enjoyed my pizza, but it wasn't anything I would rant and rave about. For dessert, we ordered the brownie, which was inedible. I NEVER send food back to the kitchen, but the server actually took it back and took it off the bill. That definitely scored them some points, because I didn't even have to ask to take it back.

Overall, I would go back to try some more organic food, but not for the brownie :)"}
{"text":"I got take out from here and did one of the make-your-own-pizza options. I got the new spicy thai red curry sauce with vegetables. Overall, the pizza was quite good. My main complaint is that I find that the cost for each pizza is very high considering the food that we received."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it simple! 2 MEDIUM pizzas (Vortex and Hawaiian) = $45 freakin ridiculous! The pizza was good! I'll go back when I win the lottery!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night and I must say the food was fantastic.  Our whole family is gluten free, so it was such a treat to have so many options. They allow you to get zoodles instead of pasta if you are low carb, which I am, at no charge.  I had the chicken piccata with zoodles and I enjoyed every single bite.  The gluten free Tiramisu was the bomb too! I would have given the spot 5 stars but our server was horrible.  She was very attentive with her regulars, but completely ignored us.  We are obviously not regulars as we visited here from out of town.  I have NEVER tipped 10 percent before eating here last night.  I am a regular 25% tipper but the service was so bad.  I will certainly come back the next time I am in town for the great food, but I will search for a another server."}
{"text":"Went here to eat dinner with my family on a Friday night. The whole restaurant was reserved!! Except for the patio and it was freezing outside. The hostess seemed to think this was pretty normal. Never going back."}
{"text":"The food and service here is excellent. We have been here 5-6 times and every time it has been great. Nick, who works at the bar, is great. He is very knowledgeable about the menu and genuinely cares about every guests experience. I have tried the quinoa Bowl which was great. Same with pizza. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! There were so many healthy choices it was almost overwhelming. A little on the pricey side but you're paying for the best quality food which is well worth it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Picazzos has been a favorite of my wife and I for a few years. Food is usually good and drinks well done also. Service has traditionally been excellent but the last 3 times we have dined it has been really horrible. We are big fans of this place but we won't be back until they add more staff to handle the business. Disappointing for a place with such potential and a strong history of service excellence. Cmon picazzo's you guys gotta fix it. Don't make your customers wait......"}
{"text":"Are you gluten free? Perhaps vegetarian? Or maybe even vegan? Wow you're super cool. Also another thing about you, you'll probably love love love this restaurant. Especially the pizza which is like none other. The gluten free crust is fluffy and flavorful, nothing like the cardboard thin stuff at other places. Also all the pasta dishes are magical. I know magical is a subjective word but guys, I don't have other words... Nothing else accurately describes the deliciousness. 

The only consideration you may have to think about is the price. You pay more here than say an Oreganos or a Nellos pizza, but for me the price is worth the food. 

Also at the Tempe location our waitress Michele was so great, she was attentive but not too disruptive or pushy. Thanks for a great dinner and service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drink! The staff is very friendly and attentive! The gluten free options that they provide are practically indistinguishable from regular options with gluten! Make sure to also try  the Pinot Noir!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was excellent but we did go on very slow Monday night.  Very nice outdoor patio.  We went for the advertised quality of ingredients rather than the gluten-free aspect.  Portion sizing was very good as we were not in a position to have \"take home\" like other Italian places back home.  We did not find the prices to be high based on our experience with buying higher quality organic ingredients."}
{"text":"Tried it out based on a recommendation from a friend.  Definitely worth it! Tasted several items from the menu and they were all AMAZING. Also, the gluten free bread was surprisingly delicious!!"}
{"text":"So earlier this week Picazzos let me down in my takeout order but redeemed my experience by my conversation with the manager Sean. I tried again tonight and it was another epic fail. First, my son's Buttery Parmesan Cheesy Linguini was not very buttery and had no apparent cheese. Second, they forgot the milk (included with kids meal). Finally, what makes me super angry and disappointed is the fact that I was told to come have the salad of my choice \"on them\" but it was not in fact \"on them\". I get the same salad every time Apple Gorgonzola with extra nuts and dressing. I was charged for both the chicken and the nuts. 



Old review:

This is the home of my favorite salad the Pear Gorgonzola. Yum! But 2 things happened today...first they have changed the pear to Apple  and then they botched my to-go order.  I ordered my salad with chicken and when I got home there was NO chicken! At $16 for a salad I was a little miffed at the takeout fail so I called the restaurant and immediately am put on hold  Finally I got to speak to Sean the manager in duty who was more than nice about what happened. I paid in crash so I didn't get the credit but I do get my salad free next time"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times now and every visit has been fantastic! Chicken chipotle pasta is my top favorite but everything I have tried has been great. For the menu being organic the prices are very reasonable. The service is very attentive and friendly as well. 

I recommend giving this place a try. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Picazzo's since their organic & gluten free \"revamp\" but have been looking forward to it for quite awhile. 

I went for lunch today and the menu really is quite impressive. Quinoa pasta galore, gluten free crust, baked (free range, humane, non-hormone treated) chicken wings, nitrate free organic bacon, and more!! 

I had no idea what to even order and definitely plan on going back. The chicken wings were \"ok\" but honestly get an A for effort considered they were made without being fried tons of awful polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oil) The greek salad was very fresh and tasty and the girlfriend I was with really enjoyed her pizza. I brought a pizza home for my husband with gluten free crust and it definitely did not disappoint. 

It was fairly busy for lunch but our appetizers and entree did take quite awhile to come out to the table (hence the 4 stars)

I really do not like pizza at all so I am not much of a critic when it comes to the perfect slice but am very much looking forward to going back to sample more salads and pastas!"}
{"text":"PAINFULLY good pizza. 

I had dinner here on new year's eve. we split the hummus appetizer, which was ridiculous. warm toasted herbed pita bread with hummus & feta cheese. so good.

I forget the name of the pizza I ordered, but like I said: PAINFULLY good. it had pesto, mozzarella, chevre, artichoke, roasted garlic, sundried tomato, pine nuts, and fresh basil. I ordered it with plain crust & it was perfect, not doughy at all but fluffy & crisp on the outside. very fresh-tasting & delicious.

they have a wide selection of pizzas, including two entire (smaller) sections devoted to vegetarian options.

I ordered the small sized pizza & someone with a large appetite could probably finish most or all of it in one sitting, but I was able to get 3 meals out of it. it was, I think, $16.

I was tempted to call it pricey, but really, it isn't fucking pizza hut. you get what you pay for.

oh, and they gave us $10 off the bill for 2010!"}
{"text":"Great food with great atmosphere and great service!!! Great great great. Amazing service everyone that works here is awesome! Wife is gluten and dairy free and this is one of the only restaurants that fully accommodates, plus the food tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"Employees there are extremely nice and the service was fast at lunch.  The gluten-free padta and bread was good. I was especially impressed with the selection of gluten-free beers, I cannot drink at lunch butwill be back."}
{"text":"WE LOVE PICAZZO's!!!:-).  GLUTEN FREE & ORGANIC HEAVEN!!:-).  AND locally owned & operated!!  We've been coming here for at least 5 years and they just get better and better!!  We eat here at least once a week.  (I don't know what happened to my original review -- it disappeared.)

Nicole always treats us like family, and we just love her!!:-)  & She makes THE BEST natural margarita!!  Very rare I can even find a place that makes a margarita without a bunch of artificial sweeteners & sugar.  Such a treat!!

Picazzo's has THE BEST CHICKEN PARM & it's GF!!  The have THE BEST dessert -- baked warm cookie with ice cream & an awesome home made/natural chocolate pudding!!    Ahhhhhhh!!

Amazing GF pizza and so many fun options.

The manager Mark is such a great guy, super nice and always a pleasure to chat with.  

We will continue to be loyal patrons to Picazzo!!:-).   OUR FAV!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza I've literally ever eaten. The worst. The crust tastes like a dry biscuit from KFC that someone put some old tomatoes on. I honestly would rather have Domino's or Pizza Hut.

I think I know the issue, though - they are one of very few pizza places that have truly gluten-free pizza, and we have a few folks in our family who are gluten-free, so I totally get it that those folks need pizza too. But the issue is that gluten-free bread of any kind just doesn't usually taste very good. Ask any gluten-free person and they will tell you the same. And even the regular pizzas here taste like they're gluten-free! It's like, listen folks, when I want pizza I want literally all the gluten you can throw my way. Bring on the week-long bloating and the tummy troubles!

So to sum it up: this place is a solid one star for anyone who is not gluten-free. It's probably a lot better for people who are, and who don't have the option for real pizza deliciousness."}
{"text":"Healthy choices and food is great! Service is good! It's a cool remodeled little place! Great for lunch with friends!!"}
{"text":"Was in Tempe for Angels Spring Training and in searching for gluten-free options nearby, came upon Picazzo's.  Yippee!!  It was AWESOME!!!  We actually need to have gluten free and soy free and this place nailed it!  This might have been one of only a handful of times our son could eat everything he saw on the table.  And it was good!  (My non allergic hubby loved it & would go back!)  We started with the kale salad (is Lyn-Genet The Plan friendly), which was tasty and what you would expect of a kale salad.  Then had mozzarella caprese, which was also very good and what you would expect (except had sliced avocado on side, which was odd but we loved!).  Came with a side of flatbread and we chose the gf version.  Then had Pizza Margharita and a custom pizza with pineapple, both on the gf crust (not the vegan crust).  Both pizzas were really good - liked the Margharita pizza best.  The level of garlic in it was outstanding.  Think the gf crust must be homemade because doesn't taste like any of the traditional pre-made gf crusts.  Wasn't the best gf crust I've ever had - kind of tasted like a cornmeal texture a little - but was still very good/tasty and would get it again!  The sauce, cheese, etc was awesome.   Have dairy free options as well.  It was Lent and a Friday so didn't try any of their meats.  Was celebrating a birthday so ended with the gf choc chip skillet cookie w/hot fudge and ice cream.  Chose the coconut milk vanilla ice cream, which I don't typically love, but this was amazing!!!  The cookie was out of this world and the cm ice cream was so creamy.  We actually returned home and bought that brand of ice cream ($6/pint!).  Given the higher cost of gluten/soy/dairy-free foods, I'm really amazed that there weren't surcharges for subbing these allergen friendly items.  Oh - and our bill was so reasonable!!!  Think we spent just over $60 for all of this!  Beyond the awesome food, the server (wish I could remember his name), was excellent!  He was super attentive!  The bus boy was there before we ever needed a water refill so was never looking to flag anyone down.  When we dropped a fork, a replacement was promptly brought over.  Even the food timing was great!  Everything came out much quicker than I would have expected, which was impressive given our order.  We did go at 5:30pm on a Sat so there were a number of people there but didn't have any wait.  Liked the ambiance - indoor or outdoor seating available.  Casual but clean and contemporary feel.  Very traditional Italian food with the option to customize it to allergen needs if you want (don't have to) and eat it in a healthier (organic/non-gmo), higher quality way.  On our way out, my son told me that I just had to write a review on this place, he loved it that much.  We will definitely return when in Phoenix area again next time.  Thank you for offering such an outstanding restaurant!  Proves that if you build a place with high quality food, people will come and return!"}
{"text":"went for the first time with my family here in this hidden gem location and was just amazed on the quality of the food how it was so amazing and fresh! First time in a long time ate my food and didnt feel stuffed or greasy or oily just felt clean i got the tomatoe basil bowl soup and bbq chicken pizza just amazing tell all our family friends about it and cant stop thinking how amazing it was !"}
{"text":"amazing food here and amazing staff! ordered the amazing wings here on happy hour extra crispy with there maple bbq sauce just fantastic also got the tomatoe basil soup and enjoyed it alot. This place makes me feel great after eating and not full and over stuffed just really great so im very satisfied and enjoy the entire meal and menu great place for family get togethers and friends hangout for drinks highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was good, the pizza is different but in a good way. The toppings are fresh and the service is great! I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I have to say I was not really a fan of the pizza, namely the crust.  The toppings and sauce were fabulous and fresh like you would expect from an 'organic' restaurant.  I had the half Meaty-Meaty and half Vortex.  The meats on the Meaty-Meaty were fabulous!  I swapped the Italian sausage for andouille sausage (spicy sausage), but I am sure both options are great.  The vegetables on the Vortex side were just sliced in long strips and not diced, which makes eating it without dropping pizza everywhere or having stuff hanging out of your mouth quite the task.  I had the regular crust and I know this place strives to be 'healthy' and 'organic', but their crust does just not compare to many other great pizza places.  I know many people rave about their gluten-free crust; maybe it is 'good for gluten-free', but their crust compared to outstanding pizza in general... it does not even come close!  

My server was great and very educated on the menu and answered all my silly questions.  I do plan on coming back; Picazzo's is quaint with good service.    I definitely plan to come check out happy hour and try many other things that are not pizza on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Picazzo's many many times.  They have my favorite pizza which is the Puttanesca.  I also love their Berry-Licious salad & the pear gorgonzola salad.  I have noticed that the salads keep getting smaller & smaller & the prices keep going up & up. Don't like that.  I like the gluten-free options & that most of the food is organic.
They have one of the best red sauces I've ever tasted.  Wish I could figure out how to make it.  
Some times the service is great & sometimes not.  One lady in particular has worked there for years & she's not so great.
Overall, when I first started going here when the were opened, I would have given them a 5 start rating, now it's down to a 4-start & that might just be because I'm halfway loyal to them.  Maybe I need to give them a 3 start rating."}
{"text":"I had lunch here a week ago and am in love.  I had the gluten free pizza and wedge salad.  I now know that I prefer a wedge without bacon, but it still hit the spot.  The gluten free pizza had potato slices and bacon on it and it was amazing.  The crust was pretty good considering it was deprived of gluteney deliciousness.  I would definitely order it again and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!"}
{"text":"Waiter wasn't the best. Food was decent but not to die for. I like it's generally a healthier place. I would skip the vegan cheesecake."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Our waiter Luke was great!  It was nice to sit on the patio and listen to live music.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service. The wait staff was prompt, friendly, and happy to share options and recommendations. Thanks Kalei!  Food was amazing. Avocado Toast and Tomato Bisque soup for me and Meaty Meaty pizza for my amazing date. We both enjoyed the atmosphere and will make it a regular spot now that we know about it.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"While staying in Scottsdale, we dined in and carried out. Very satisfied with gluten free options and service.  The pizzas and entrees were delicious with fresh toppings and plenty of flavor."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and the food tastes really fresh. I've never tried the pastas, but the pizza is phenomenal!! I love the Thai pizza, it's very unique and delicious. The only problem I have is that it's a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I personally think Picazzo's food is not bad at all. My group of friends came in on a Monday night around 8PM so of course it wasn't busy. We got seated right away and our server was friendly and pretty funny. Two of my friends got a large pizza, half was chipotle and the other half was spicy Thai peanut sauce ( or something like that). I tried and thought it was very good. It was different from traditional pizzas, the hand tossed crust was to die for. Another friend of ours can't eat gluten so he got a gluten-free crust pepperoni and I, of course, had to get my greedy hand on it and it was tasty. I, myself, got an appetizer which was the Spicy Thai Peanut chicken wings. There were about 8 to 10 wings for 12 dollars, hm...a little bit pricey but was worthwhile. The flavor was different, but good. The wings were not breaded, but were crunchy.

I guess I gave a 4 star because it's a little pricey...I know it's Scottsdale, organic and everything, but for a meal and a beer, you can easily pay 40 bucks, which is, to me, not a daily thing. 

But in general, I'd recommend this restaurant. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!! We are out of towners just enjoying spring training but this place was excellent.  We had the vegan chicken sticks as an app and for dinner the Thai spicy peanut pasta which had a perfect spice to it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the fact that 90% of the menu is gluten free or available as gluten free. They use local food sources when available and 100% of menu is organic. Food was delicious. I have many food allergies, and it was great to eat out and not get sick afterward. Had spinach artichoke dip with gluten free flatbread as an appetizer..it was amazing! I pretty much ate it all by myself! Go during happy hour; otherwise appetizers are pricey. My family loved the meatball appetizer as well. I got chicken piccata..it was a little light on chicken, but very good. Mom had chicken parmesan and she said it was good but overcooked. Dad and hubby had the pork cha cha. Both said it was good but hubby said it needed something extra..maybe some spice. I got a free dessert for my bday and the gluten free chocolate chip cookie skillet with organic vanilla ice cream was to die for!!!! Whole family moaned over it. Would definitely go back and it's a 50 min. drive from our house!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options! The buffalo \"wings\" appetizer was especially tasty - even my meat-eating family agreed."}
{"text":"The pizza sauce has no taste, like plain tomatoes, pizza crust was burnt when served, sorry i aint coming back anytime soon, if ever. Try adding some onion and oregano herb to your sauce for taste!"}
{"text":"We had Picazzo's cater our wedding a few months ago, and we were more than happy! Sean was more than accommodating to our needs including working with several food allergies, and was so flexible with helping us to design our menu. He was extremely responsive to all of our messages, and everything was delivered to the venue on time! We are sooo happy and extremely grateful to Picazzo's and Sean with all of their help making our day perfect, and got many complements from guests about the food. We would definitely recommend Picazzo's to anyone looking for catering for their event (we had 150 people at our wedding and it was no problem), and the pricing is extremely reasonable - especially considering everything is gluten-free!! WOULD RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Picazzo's is very simple. When I say simple, I mean ordinary.
In all fairness to them, I did not try the pizza. But from a pasta standpoint - they used a lot of cheese on everything. Again, the salad was an italian chopped but loaded with cheese. The meal could have served two people - and it was a lunch portion!! (pasta/salad combo) So if you're looking for good portions and something to fill you up - you found your place.

This used to be Pasta Pomodoro before, and the place was beat. But they've actually done some nice work to it and it's a very pleasant dining room now. Major props for that.

I'd probably come back with a hungry, large group (kid friendly) if we wanted a casual meal. Otherwise, I'll pass and stick to more unique places."}
{"text":"As a newbie to the Gluten-free lifestyle and one who loves to dine out, I was really excited to find Picazzos. First off, their menu is filled with all of my favorite Italian specialties, with about 90% of them gluten-free. We took the whole family for a Sunday lunch. I had the Spaghetti/Chicken Picatta lunch special with a ceaser side salad, all GF. The pasta was light and flavorful with big pieces of white meat chicken and tons of yummy capers. The salad was just ok. I'm kind of a ceaser snob so that actually why they only got 4 stars. My husband had a pear and Gorgonzola salad along with a slice of pepperoni pizza. The vinaigrette on the salad was really good and he said the pizza crust was excellent. His meal was not GF. The kids split GF spaghetti and meatballs and a cheese pizza. They both devoured the pizza and meatball, but the spaghetti was a little tougher to sell. The pasta is Quinoa which has a different texture than regular spaghetti. But the flavor was still great with the sauce on it. We didn't stay for desert but looked at the menu and every selection is GF. We will definitely return to try some of the more GF options. For all of you hungry Celiac's out there, Picazzos does it right!"}
{"text":"Another great experience today. My gorgeous girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner and Nick the bartender helped us choose an amazing custom pie. Goat cheese, basil, mozzarella, corn, olive oil... Ummm yup! Washed down with a couple of cold brews and you have yourself a solid Thursday evening. Great service and great pizza."}
{"text":"Picazzo's is the one place we can go and not worry about gluten contamination. With a dedicated gf kitchen, non GMO ingredients and the most tasty choices out there, it can't be beat.
It's our favorite go to restaurant with an amazing staff."}
{"text":"Certainly a decent option if you are looking for a healthy alternative to all the fast food places nearby. Pizza was good, not great. Salads were a bit underwhelming. The descriptions on the menu are better than the actual item.
Space is nice enough, better for lunch than dinner."}
{"text":"New to vegan cuisine and I have to say... IM HOOKED! Came here with my son for a mommy/son date night and it was phenomenal! My son had the vegan cheese pizza and he devoured every bite. Lol I had the vegan Bianca pasta plate.. OH EM GEE... hands down the best I've had! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"What a disappintment!!  Overpriced and horrible service.  You can do much better at other Italian restaurants in the area.  Will never return!!"}
{"text":"Picazzo's is one of the few places I enjoy eating lunch in Tempe. I have some irritating food allergies (gluten, egg and milk free) - and find it very difficult to simply order a lunch without asking the waitstaff to leave off everything. It's not the case at Picazzo's and I commend them for it.

My review is exclusively for the innovative, enormous and filling salads I eat at Picazzos.  The salads have a good mix of dark green leafy and romaine, and are loaded with veggies. Typically when I order my big salad at other places, after they remove the cheese, croutons etc, I am left with a giant pile of romaine, 3 cucumbers, 2 cherry tomatoes and a  cold piece of cut up chicken.  I don't use muchsalad dressing, so just imagine how tasteless this is...

The salads here have enough extra veggies to make every bite interesting."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place because they cater to poor stomachs like me, with Gluten-Free needs!! On top of that, the gluten free crust and pasta they offer is exceptional! Always great service, each and every time :)"}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time. Wonderful salad pizza . Cute place great server nice wine glasses. So convenient to our hotel across the street @ The Marriott Residence 
We will frequent this place again loved everything."}
{"text":"Worst food ever,healthy or otherwise. Good reviews on here must come from members of the restaurant staff. Had the Fig/Gorgonzola pizza. It was burnt with a skimpy amount of everything but the arugula. Two tries were two too much!"}
{"text":"This place only gets better every time we go there. They've redone their menu, and it's even better than it was before. Yes, it's a bit costly, but if you're gluten intolerant like I am, this is your dream restaurant. You can eat everything on the menu... yes... everything. It's like when you were able to eat everything before you became a Celiac! It's a weird feeling to not have to ask for a gluten-free menu, or which items are safe to eat.. or even worse, hear a waitress drone on about how there's most likely cross contamination across the whole menu.

But that's not the only reason why the place is great. The food is fantastic in its own right, whether you're a celiac or not. It's genuinely just great italian food. All their breads and crusts taste great, and are really flavorful. You don't feel like you're settling for \"gluten-free food\" when you eat here. It's real, delicious italian food.

Their service is also fantastic. We've never had a waiter/waitress that was rude. Each one seems like they're happy to be there, and proud to work at a place that offers such options. Plus they have a \"club\" of sorts that racks up points pretty quickly, and will give you 10 dollar discounts on future meals, which helps with the higher prices.

All in all, there's not many places I can eat at in North Scottsdale without getting a gluten reaction. This place has become a sort of refuge for me. I know this place is safe no matter what I eat, and I can't thank them enough for that. 

I don't write reviews on yelp very often, unless the place is out of this world, or if the place was downright horrible. This is the former. If you're a celiac, you've just found your favorite place to eat in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The lunch special is about $11 - 20 for a slice of pizza, small side salad and Non-alcoholic drink. There's an upcharge for  everything, unless you want a plain garden salad, plain slice of cheese pizza and run-of-the-mill Diet Coke.

The portions are good if you're not hungry. For example, I got the lunch special with a Zo's Chopped Side Salad and Chicken Picatta Bigoli. The salad was good, but honestly it was about the size of a Wendy's $1 side salad. The pasta reminded me of a Pasta Roni side dish, not very flavorful. It was about two-thirds the size of a side salad.

The service was OK. It didn't take long to get the food, and he was great with the seperate checks.

Picazzo's was OK, but I wouldn't go back, except a group of middle-aged girlfriends like it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! ...My husband and I just transitioned to a more plant based diet so we were looking for vegan friendly options.  

We wanted to try a few things so we ordered:

Happy Hour Hummus: super yummy cranberry jalapeño blend. Fresh pita bread was super warm and salty goodness. 

Sriracha Coleslaw: So good. 6/10 spicy meter. Fresh and crunchy. Hubby hates coleslaw but loved this. 

Thai Peanut Zoodles: Zucchini noodles with a Thai coconut sauce. Fresh. Spicy. Creamy. Healthy. Everything I wanted. Filling!!!

Puttanesca Pizza: artichokes, olives, basil, tomato... with daiya dairy free cheese. Perfect again. Fresh!!! Crush was super yummy. 

We had awesome service too!!! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT pizza and food place!  But, more importantly to us, this is AN AWESOME GLUTEN FREE HAVEN!!!!  My son cannot eat gluten or dairy and this location was so incredibly wonderful to us!!!  I am Vegan and my preferences were still important to them.  My son, with his digestive and allergy concerns, felt like a king because he could have almost anything on the menu!  They are wonderful because anyone without concerns will love the menu and for those of us who work with allergies are treated wonderfully!  Food is awesome!"}
{"text":"As one of the many people with celiac disease this is by far one of the best places that I've tried. I am in love with the five cheese ravioli drenched in their pesto sauce with sun dried red tomatoes and spinach. I also enjoyed how most of their ingredients are locally grown right here in the valley.  This was a very good experience with great service on a Thursday ."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian! I had the Chicken Piccata-flavor galore...pizza has all the requirement, soft flavorful crust, light marinara with tangy notes and a light finish. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I've driven passed this joint for ages, which is a good sign! They've been there as long as I've lived in Chandler. My husband and I stopped in for lunch and were impressed at how clean and inviting it was. The chairs are weirdly close,  and the hostesses sat us close to another table, though there were plenty of other spots open.  

We shared the California pizza and the house salad,  and I had an iced tea. The tea was fresh and arrived quickly. We liked the look of the appetizers, but this place is a bit pricey so we opted not to. 

The pizza arrived quickly as well! It was super tasty,  and the salad was robust.  The best part? The house Italian...I told my husband I could drink it straight like a shot.  

I want to go back and try the pastas as I saw other patrons having it and it looked great.  The only reason I can't give all 5 stars is the price,  which is a bit rich for our *lunch fare* blood."}
{"text":"This is the best food for any that loves vegan chicken. Great service and the place looks beautiful. The people were very nice. I had the buffalo chicken and it tasted just like from a gourmet restaurant. This is the best food I've had in recent years"}
{"text":"Finally!! A Gluten-free pizza crust worth eating!  The Husband and I usually have to order 2 separate pizzas, because I refuse to eat most gluten-free crusts... they are usually crumbly with little resemblance to a \"real\" crust.  But, at Picazzo's, we have found a happy compromise - a seriously delicious gluten-free option.  Wow!

We have tried the Meaty-Meaty (they aren't kidding - it is LOADED with all-natural, nitrate-free meats) and the Diavolo (heaven!!) pizzas.  The Italian Chopped Salad is delicious.  Keep in mind that the SMALL salad feeds 2 people easily... we watched a number of tables receive what looked like enough salad to feed a small country!  You'd probably need 8 people to finish the large salad, especially if you are also ordering a pizza.  

Thanks for offering edible gluten-free items AND healthier meat options!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I hit Picazzo's at least once a week and have done so for over a year.  We LOVE their pizza of the day special with a specialty salad of your choice.

The pastas are very tasty and the specialty pizza combinations are wonderful.  My favorite is the Classico!   We've even ordered a dozen pizza's to feed our entire office for lunch meetings. 

The restaurant itself is small, but it's VERY clean and tastefully decorated. 

The staff there is amazingly friendly-- especially Jenny-- who remembers our names and our drink preferences.   The service is very quick which is great when you have a limited amount of time for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!!  The gluten free pizza is the best that I have ever had!  They have gluten free pizza by the slice which is something that I have never seen.  GF garlic flat bread and chipotle elbow pasta are also amazing.  If you are ever in the area make sure that you come by and eat here."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. My entire party that I was dining with was vegan and we all ordered off the vegan menu. My mom ordered the vegan chicken Parmesan and when our food arrived we were all surprised how realistic their chicken was. Turns out it was real chicken. My mom trusted the restaurant and they fed her something that she cannot eat. We don't know if she is going to be sick from this. We told our server and she took the plate away and came back 10 minutes later with the new vegan dish, which looked completely different. At this point, she was disgusted and had completely lost her appetite. The server boxed the vegan chicken Parmesan to go and then had the audacity to not take it off of the original bill! She was going to make us pay for something that could have made us sick. To our surprise the manager never even came by once to apologize to us. Definitely will not be returning again after this incident."}
{"text":"Worst ever. Cold soggy pizza. Picazzos promised delivery ... don't ever use it & beware of picazzos in general. All info I was given was false, disgusting gross expensive pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special -- salad and slice of pizza.  Gluten-free pizza is easy to get wrong, this place makes a nice GF crust that has a bite.  

My husband initially guffawed at the prices for mere pizza.  I said, \"but it's organic.\"  He rolled his eyes.  But then he ate it and he understood that he was paying extra for freshness.  He even gave a thumbs up to my \"GF nastiness\" as he refers to all things GF.

Thank you Picazzo for making a point to my dear lover which I was unable to make previously."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of gluten-free options that are absolutely delicious! Highly recommend, and definitely try the sangria!"}
{"text":"Got take out from here because they had vegan options. Ordered the vegan chicken strips as an app- pretty dry and tough, tasted over cooked. Got the kale salad and it was pretty bland- not enough dressing and no flavor, plus lots of stems in the kale and it was tough. The pizza was decent. It was expensive and not worth it! I definitely wouldn't order here again."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful, wonderful meal with my wife-very selective (picky) eater. She LIKED it!!  And I LOVED it because I felt so good all day after eating here and into the evening. I didn't have to eat dinner the portions were so generous. What a wonderful experience. Please go and support this tasty restaurant."}
{"text":"Our family visits Scottsdale at least once a year for a week's vacation and traditionally Picazzo's is our first night in town dinner, no longer we will replace it with Carrabba's (review to follow).

On prior visits we saw the gluten free options for pasta and pizza on the menu and never really noticed as we do not order gluten free.  On our visit on 12/26/12 we were surprised to see the entire menu now gluten free, and flavor free as well from the dish I had.

I commented to the waiter that I was skeptical about the flavor of quinoa pasta and turkey bolognese but he said it was delicious and I wouldn't notice the difference.  I ordered Uncle Louie's favorite (penne I think with sausage and turkey bolognese) with an open mind only to discover my initial instinct was correct.  The pasta had poor texture and the sauce had no depth of flavor because of the turkey meat instead of beef--I guess beef fat flavor is noticable, who'd a guessed other than chefs for decades.

Given that I was skeptical I thought our server would come by and ask, \"how do you like it...\" or something similar.  Nope, no pass by, no question as to how it was.

I think the whole organic, gluten-free dining has jumped the shark and become the domain of the pretentious Whole-Foods crowd and has become exemplified at Picazzo's.  There are certainly many options for pizza and Italian in Scottsdale and in this neighborhood to make it easy to not go to Picazzo's. Understanding some like this sort of thing, not me."}
{"text":"It is a shame because they had such a good menu. We went there for breakfast. There were about 12 people in the restaurant and they had run out of menus. We were there for 20 minutes and all we got was coffee. It also seems as though they can't afford to turn on the air conditioner. Would be a great place to eat if the managers would understand customer service. We had to leave"}
{"text":"Let's start by stating they did a great job on the decor in transforming the place which used to be an NYPD pizza. We went for Happy Hour and they had decent specials, both for Drinks and food. Local craft beers were only $4.
To eat we started with the Turkey meatballs which were delicious, moist and great taste!
My wife had the Tomato Basil Bisque soup which was very good. Others at our table ordered two orders of wings, Buffalo and their Italian seasoned, both were good, nothing over the top but good.
I also ordered the 12\" Meaty pizza which had 4 different meats on it. The crust was on the thicker side and I opted for the regular crust and the toppings were plentiful with a good flavor of sauce and cheese. My only issue is the price of the pizza as their 12\" costs $19! For a pizza that's a lot and the 16\" is a whopping $29!
I'd definitely go back but mainly just for the Happy Hour specials."}
{"text":"Very Good place to eat GOOD organic italian food.  The chicken with pasta with capers were great!!! It was a good portion size, but could have used another piece of bread.  I also got the chocolate chip cookie skillet (gluten free) and it was so good!!!!
I've never had good, organic italian food!!!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with friends. One ordered 2 slices of peperoni pizza ($3.75 per slice, a bit pricey for one item slices in my mind), the other ordered the lunch special plate ($9): 1 slice of pizza (she choose cheese) with a side salad (in this case the Asian salad minus nuts). None of this was appealing to me by price or appearance. I ordered the lunch pasta plate choosing spaghetti & chicken piccata with a side salad (Cesar salad) with the drink included. My plate set me back $10.50, which is more than most people who eat lunch out during the week try to spend. Not a fan of the one item topping pizza and not gullible enough to go for the spicy Italian sausage slice at $4.25 a slice! I figured I went with my best option. 

Well as I said theirs did not look very appealing. The Asian salad dressing and few slivers of wantons was all that made this lettuce salad Asian. Usually that salad is a cabbage based salad. The pizza slices were not very large for the price by the way and are basically precooked and warmed over when ordered with whatever topping you select. NYPD does this a lot better and gives you more options to top your pizza off with and you can choose more than one. 

The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the chicken piccata was tender and flavorful but still not outstanding and for the price was a very, very, small serving. My salad was old - ends were turning brown and it was not very crisp and the dressing thick and not so good. The small piece of bread that they rave about as homemade was dry and served without butter. I mean it was really dry! Like maybe days old dry! 

All this organic and gluten free food did not impress me. Glad I don't require a gluten free diet and have lived many years without organic indigents, because if this is a fine example of both I would quickly lose interest in food. Oh and that drink was also an organic juice based 10 oz soda that by itself sold for $2.50 when not a part of the lunch special. 

The restaurant itself sits on the corner of an unassuming strip mall. It has a small crowed patio that was full except for the 2 tables in the direct sun without umbrellas. The interior appeared clean and had a casual slightly upscale appearance but also a bit crowed by the closeness of the tables. Therefore this would not be a good place for kids.  Also they don't appear to offer desserts! And our waitress lacked personality and appeared that she would prefer to be somewhere else. 

So I give the place 2 stars which is generous with all things taken into account."}
{"text":"The first time I had tried this place about a year ago (pre yelp) I wasn't that impressed.  So I thought I'd give it another try just for the health of it.

WOW- very impressed with everything across the board.  Let's start with the 2 pasta dishes myself and significant other had.

Pesto- okay, so Picazzo's emphasizes fresh, healthy ingredients and sometimes one trades off flavor for the natural organic options.  This was so not the case as the pesto pasta that had delicious home made pasta was complimented by sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese which gave a perfect balance to the pesto sauce.  I did throw in some crushed red peppers for some heat and a small dash of salt, but no complaints but compliments on this dish.

Significant other had the Shrimp Scampi.  Now usually Scampi is drowning in an over buttery sauce.  Here again, homemade pasta with the perfect combo of olive oil and butter with lemon and capers (which I assume the good saltiness came from).

Had the usual Jack and Coke and the bartender Nick actually came over to make sure the drink was the way I liked it.  The second one was even better...thanks Nick!!!!!

Will definitely be back to try their other delicious items.  

Service of course was excellent, place was warm and inviting.  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Awesome GF options and very tasty too!! I really love this place but their prices are pretty high. I know it's good quality food but we don't get to enjoy much because of it. A kids pizza meal,  very small, is almost $10. 

The place inside is very nice. Last owners were great and a bit more customer service oriented. New ownership is good too but made the place too fancy."}
{"text":"We love this pizza joint so much, we've become regulars. All of the wait staff are great, but Nick, the bartender is our favorite. Gregarious and always has a welcoming smile. (Eat in the bar area to get quick seats and service) 
Being a gluten free couple, we typically struggle finding restaurant options, but PP never lets us down. With their tasty gluten free appetizers, gf pizza crusts and most importantly Gf desert options- it's easy for us to invite friends and family and not feel like anyones food options are limited.
Whether your gluten free or gluten full- PP is a great option for dining out in a friendly, casual, yet classy restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you like organic and vegan food - this is the place for you. My date enjoyed her vegan meal quite a bit. I chose, \"Uncle Lou's Favorite\" - I think that's what it was called. Any way it was advertised as Italian sausage, roasted peppers, gluten-free pasta and red sauce. The sausage tasted like clumps of sawdust; though the sauce was OK. I was told it was, \"turkey sausage.\" Yeah, I don't remember seeing that clarified on the menu. Anyway - if you like Italian meat sausage seasoned traditionally DON'T order here.

The ambiance was nice and the server was friendly. I would have ordered desert but they were short staffed and I couldn't wait any longer. (Had to get back to the hospital before visiting hours ended).

I would return and try another dish."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, it was really good. It's very limiting when trying to find a restaurant specializing in gluten free items. I've been to this location many times, even when it was temporarily owned by an independent. 
We decided to come here since my boyfriend has never tried this place. They have a great daily happy hour 3-6, half off starters. 
We ordered several items in hopes to enjoy some great dishes. Unfortunately, what we ordered had a serious lack of flavor. The turkey meatballs, which I've had before and were good, were missing something.......flavor! The roasted veggies were boring. The hummus was typical. And the baked chicken wings with Tao peanut sauce was 'ehhh'. The overall missing element was FLAVOR!!! 
If I were paying full price for these items, I would have been really upset. As it was, I felt we overpaid. 
Will I return? Provably not. Too bad. This place as once very good."}
{"text":"If you have celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or just wanna eat some delicious organic food, this is the place to go! 100% of the items on the menu are gluten free and many ingredients are organic and locally sourced. The portion sizes were large which made the prices more reasonable. The BBQ chicken pizza, chipotle BBQ wings, and cookie skillet were amazing! It's been about 5 years since I've been able to walk into a restaurant and have an overwhelming amount of options to choose from...usually I just have to get a salad since it's the only GF thing at most restaurants. Overall highly recommended!

Also Cara is the BEST server so be sure to ask for her. We are regulars and she has our order memorized! She is always super friendly and speedy!"}
{"text":"$47 for a large take out pepperoni pizza and large chopped salad is a little high considering the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place particularly if you have dietary restrictions. Lots of options and they seem to be very good at customization."}
{"text":"Best gluten free bread I have ever had! I'm not even GF and I loved it!"}
{"text":"Gluten free - my favorite restauant in Scottsale, AZ. Always have great food and it's all gluten free! Staff are friendly enough arnd do make sure that the order is correct and if not they do it right (only happened once) and I go there very frequently.The food is TASTY! I always hit that place up when I visit AZ."}
{"text":"Great food but lousy service. Not attentive (drinks not refilled), food took almost 30 minutes and had to chase server to pay. Tomato soup was amazing and all food is usually good."}
{"text":"As always, excellent service and food. They just changed the menu (April 2015), so check it out if you haven't been in a while."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time tonight. I had the gluten free cheesy breadsticks and the gluten free meaty meaty pizza. Amazing and I'll be back there soon to try the gluten free pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch.  The service was very quick and friendly.  I had the Spicy Indian Curry Chicken with Fresh Linguine.  I'm normally not a big fan of Gluten-free food, but this dish was quite good, lots of favor, and quite tasty overall.  I also had a Caesar Salad which was very fresh and crisp.  For Gluten-free folks I'd definitely put this on your list as a great place to eat!  For the rest of us, it's still a very good place with fresh, good tasting, quality food!  I also appreciate the quick service at lunch so you aren't there for a long time on your lunch break."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and truly enjoyed my experience. Nice to finally see vegan and gluten free options. I will definitively come back as the food was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"My friend [who has celiac's disease] took me here for lunch.  I have a daughter who is gluten-free so I am always willing to try any place that serves gluten free, as I can sympathize with how difficult it is to find decent food to accomodate this food allergy. 

This however, was not decent, it was downright gross.

First let me say that it is VERY expensive.  I had a lunch special:  1 slice of pizza, a caesar salad, and water - $9.50.  She had a pasta lunch special:  gluten free pasta and a side salad:  $13.50.  Holy cow.

The pizza slice was not gluten free and it tasted awful anyway.  It's really hard to screw up regular pizza crust [because it has literally like 4 ingredients], but the crust had an odd flavor to it.  The pizza was covered in greasy cheese, and the sauce tasted like it was loaded with sugar.  The salad was equally disappointing:  the lettuce had brown edges [aka OLD] and was drenched in nothing that resembled a classic caesar dressing.  

The service was ok to average.  It took the waitress at least 15 minutes to process my credit card....
This is honestly probably one of the worst restaurants I have been to in a while."}
{"text":"Picazzos won best gluten free restaurant in 2015! With that being said, even if you aren't gluten free or care for gluten free food, this restaurant is still amazing. They offer great pizza, quinoa bowls, salads, pasta dishes, as well as comfort food dishes.

I love that they offer foods to people with a wide variety of food allergies, without having to sacrifice any of the flavor.

I have had several items on the menu and I would recommend the spicy Thai quinoa bowl, any of the pizzas, and the Parmesan chicken- all amazing."}
{"text":"Ok... this isn't about our server, who was great. But it isn't his fault that the vegan Asian Crunchy \"Chikn\" salad would basically an unruly pile of romaine, a tiny bit of red cabbage, and sesame ginger dressing. WHERE WERE THE BEAN SPROUTS?? WHAT ABOUT THE SLICED ALMONDS?? NO HEIRLOOM CARROTS??? And the mock chicken in this dish tasted, smelled like and had the texture of rotten string cheese. Nasty. They shouldn't have the beautiful detail in the menu if they're really giving you some generic salad. Although maybe our server IS part of this review. Since he should know the menu enough to refuse to send this overpriced green pile out to us knowing we hadn't ordered a green plain salad.  #disappointedvegan"}
{"text":"I just competed in a bodybuilding show, and one knows you can't go overboard in indulgences or you'll swell up like a balloon. I yelped pizza alternatives, and dairy-free cheese!? YES! 
We were seated automatically and had our appetizers within5 minutes. Our waiter was awesome and we never had an empty water glass-SCORE!
GF crust with dairy-free cheese--Vortex signature.
We went during their Healthy Hour which we got 
-The Mule alcohol drink, a brew, hummus spread (regular and jalapeño) and a platter of wings (buffalo and BBQ) 
I would definitely go again and again and again.
I just wish they had one in my hometown of El Paso,TX."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and rented an airbnb house with 10 people.  We ordered delivery from Picazzo's and everything was amazing!   Truly delicious food - wings, GF focaccia(!), and all the pizzas we had and the zoodle pasta and carbonara were fantastic.  I wish we had this restaurant back at home - it would be our go to for sure."}
{"text":"Fills a niche for people who need gluten free food.
I don't require it, so it was not great.
The pasta seemed rubbery and undercooked. Maybe this is the way gluten free pasta normally is but I was not used to it.
The appetizers were good but at $11-13 each, they are only worth it during happy hour (1/2 price) but it is every day 3-6pm, so that is a positive
Entree prices were similar to other surrounding Italian restaurants in Tempe"}
{"text":"This place has the most vegan and vegetarian options for Italian places. Their food is all organic which is awesome and they do carry Gardein \"meat\" for us vegans. I always get great service"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant to get great salads and good service. I recommend the natural chopped Italian. They also have really great tiramisu."}
{"text":"About as good as gluten free can get. They are 100% gluten free, understand food allergies and have 'dairy free' ice cream. What more can you ask for? The place is clean, the servers are trained in food allergies, I can eat here and not be sick for days on end.  Awesome work!

A hint to avoid the weekend rush- go for a late lunch and you wont have to wait.
The only negative is they only have tables and chairs for seating, no booths."}
{"text":"Great lunch! I had the Asian salad and slice of the day. Really beautiful place. I'll be back. My friend had pepperoni pizza and Cesar salad and said it was the best pizza ever. The service is not the greatest but can forgive that."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch one day...  This place is amazing! Gluten free, vegan AND it tasted delicious."}
{"text":"The menu has a wide selection of gluten free items, which is nice to try something that I have never tried before. Went with the raviolis and they were great. Good portions as well as I took some home. Will be back for more food!"}
{"text":"They really should stop saying they have healthy food. They have organic food but merely being organic does not make it healthy.  Pizza and pasta will never be healthy no matter how free of GMOs they are. 

Don't get me wrong the food here is really good it us just not healthy"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of both of these locations. It is my special stop for gluten-free pizza pickup. Many healthy allergy-friendly food solutions. The salads are also delicious! The staff is courteous and the place is always buzzing lunch and dinner time."}
{"text":"I wanted to get out of the house for lunch today so decided to stop at Picazzo's. In the three times that I have visited, the food has always been good. It's on the pricey side, so today we came and took advantage of the $10 lunch special. They were also giving away a free cheesecake for anyone that checks in on yelp, and to be honest that's why we came. I ordered a caesar salad and pepperoni pizza which I was happy with- but it is hard to mess those things up. The raspberry cheesecake was just meh. My only real complaint was the service. The waiter was nice enough, but two things were slight annoyances: 1. The server never checked back after the food was deliver to see if I was satisfied. 2. The dirty plates were left on my table until I was done with dessert. I used to work in the service industry so perhaps I take notice more than others, but this is serving 101. The table was so crowded I could not even find a place to put the check so I had to lean it up against a dirty plate. Will I return? Probably. But am I dying to come back, no. Maybe if they do another promo in the future."}
{"text":"Chicken piccata was delicious. Gluten free pasta is the the only choice but I couldn't tell the difference. Place is cute and family friendly. Bar is offered off to the side and provided lots of drink options. Plethora of vegetarian and gluten free options while still providing options for the meat lovers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered our food online tonight and when I went to the restaurant they had no knowledge of my order being placed.  I figured my husband might have not submitted the order, but he swears he did. It really didn't bother me too much, because I understand that there can be technical hiccups every once and a while. So I ordered our food and waited patiently for it to be ready.

I got home and I wasn't particularly happy with what it looked like. I ordered the Biana Pasta, the Berry Salad, and an order of wings.  I have to say  that my husband's salad looked pretty good, but I just wasn't in the mood for salad.  My pasta wasn't very good. I could have made a better dish from store bought pasta and sauce.  We ordered the maple wings and they had a weird taste and the chicken was quite rubbery.  

Our meal came to about $40, and I'm glad that we had a $20 off coupon. Had I been dining in the restaurant I would've asked for my money back.  I will not be dining here again and I will not tell anyone to go here based on the bland pasta and wings."}
{"text":"I am so happy that people love Picazzo's  This restaurant has been a part of my life for the past 6 years.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the service, food and atmosphere!

If you are looking for a wonderful patio to meet your friends on for a drink-- look no further than Picazzo's in Tempe!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place to eat as long as it's not an hr before they  close...  Went there to eat last night around 820. I ordered a Greek salad without red onions, no feta and no dressing. Salad came out with only cucumbers and tomatoes on it, no olives, and no peppercinis . Clearly the runners don't check their food to make sure it's right before going to the table. I had to call the server over to bring it to his attention which took forever because he was to busy doing his side work rolling sliverware. My sister ordered the Thai lasagna one for her and one to go for her boyfriend. Then server came back to tell her that they didn't have the ingredients because it's new on the menu so she had the regular lasagna. She said it was good but the server failed to make the order Togo so her boyfriend didn't get his meal due to the kitchen being closed. He stated he didn't hear that but brought the Togo lemonade *side eye* so you heard the Togo lemonade the same time we ordered the togo lasagna...? OH OK. Nevertheless the food is good as long as you go within reasonable hours. Their hours state they close a 9 on Sunday, according to me they left at 8. But the server did say that he'd remember next time. Glad he knows there will be a next time. #HappyMondayYelpers"}
{"text":"A good , not great pizza.  No gluten, organic, local ingredients, saves whales, earthy, etc.  We get it!  It's only a pizza.  It is a good option for a tasty carryout pie, but not good enough for a 2 topping large to be $24 bucks."}
{"text":"Best GF pizza. I'm from Minnesota and the GF crusts are 10\" compared to the whopping 16\" GF here. Great food. Worth the money, worth the trip."}
{"text":"Years ago we came here regularly because we liked the salads and loved the pizzas. At some point it was decided to make this a healthier place so the pizza crust and some ingredients were changed. The salads were still good but pizza matters to me. After several years we returned. Four of us had two salads and they remain good. One tried pasta and enjoyed it.  We had the vortex pizza and it was better than we remembered. One friend had a chicken pizza and declared it good.  I had Australian Shiraz which is vegetarian: I inquired but it wasn't explained how wine can be vegetarian. We had desserts: brownie and ice cream for one couple and chocolate chip cookie and ice cream for the other.  Service was just ok. I think having an additional waitress would have been helpful as service suffered as our waitress tried to keep up.   We come back when we want pizza again."}
{"text":"Bland, bland, BLAAAAAAAND!

I ordered the lunch special to-go, my choice was the pasta with 7 vegetables, kale salad and an Arnold Palmer. The kale salad had an olive oil lemon dressing where it had a hint of lemon taste, but that was about it. True Foods offers a similar salad with less ingredients in it, but somehow it has way more flavor. I think it's because the olive oil was low quality. I moved on to the pasta hoping it would be better, the sauce was super thin and oily, the oil spilled everywhere. I tasted it and the pasta was overcooked and mushy, and didn't go too well with the super bland sauce that tasted of the same gross olive oil as the salad. I dumped a bunch of Parmesan on it to try and save it, but it was too far gone. Then there was the garlic bread that had barely a hint of garlic flavor. Even my Arnold Palmer was bland! It just tasted like watered down lemonade. To top it off my lunch cost $16, so not worth it. There's lots of other high quality options in the area for less, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today with friends... it was AMAZING!!  Two of the gals had gluten issues, and loved their alternative choices!  I had their lunch special pizza, which was yummy, and tomatoes bisque soup...  such a great choice!!  Though I was pleased with the food, the best part was the service.  Anthony was exceptional!!  He offered suggestions and made sure we were happy.  He was a delight and we all commented on his wonderful service!  I appreciate when servers treat you like a guest!  Kudos to you, Anthony!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are always on the lookout for restaurants with GF items for myself. When this one popped up on a Google search we thought we'd give it a shot during lunch. The place was a bit less than half full, we were seated promptly, and drink orders were taken. We both got the Lemonade which tasted a bit off - not sure if it needed more sugar, more lemon, or a bit of both, but it was not what we expected. We redeemed the free cheese bread for an appetizer for checking in and placed our order. The appetizer was delicious, not overly greasy and heavy, and the marina was delectable! It took another 20 mins or so for our entrees to arrive and it appeared there weren't many servers. When our food did arrive it was hot, fresh, and beautifully plated. The Cannelloni was amazing and I love that they also supply roasted veggies as a side. My husband enjoyed his chicken parm and we both ended up bringing home a doggy bag. Overall we are happy to have found another restaurant option despite the higher prices and wait time. The food is amazing, doesn't weigh you down, and the server, Keith, was very friendly. We will be returning to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"We love Picazzo's in Scottsdale although management in Peoria/Glendale is horrific.  Went for lunch on Monday and found multiple tables waiting 40 minutes plus for food and some longer. Many patrons found themselves walking to the back to hunt for servers.  Food was not the issue, service was.  Drinks from the bar were 15 minutes or longer for delivery.  One of the worse service situations we have experienced.   Unfortunate!!!  Shame on the manager!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and healthy. We love the gluten free and vegan options. Service is ok. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Being gluten free, Picazzo's is a gem of restaurant for me.  They have a huge selection of gf items ranging from salads, pasta dishes, & pizza to desserts.  The food is always wonderful (especially the gf pizza cookie!), and most of the servers are very friendly and seem to enjoy their job.   The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are a little bit pricey, however this a fabulous establishment and definitely a wonderful 2-3 times a month treat!"}
{"text":"I love Picasso' s! They have great gluten free options. The gluten free bread and pizza crust are fantastic.  They also have  an option for dairy free cheese.  The service tonight was slower than usual but it was Saturday night and they are busy.  Usually the service is quick."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love, LOVE this place. I am extremely biased though - I love wine and I'm a vegetarian. This is a great place to go for the whole family. I actually feel like I can fit in when I order buffalo wings because they're *drumroll* tofu! Of course - the carnivores in the family can indulge in regular meaty chicken wings. Their pizzas are fantastic, appetizers are good - I would go here once a week if it was closer!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place on a recommendation of a friend. Pleasantly surprised to find a healthy Italian restaurant! I ordered the sesame ginger zoodles which were amazing and the tomato basil soup was fantastic!!! Service and our server was wonderful Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Just got a comment from Rob W. who works for Picasso ' s I guess? I usually don't care enough to respond but for some reason his comments struck a cord for me. 
    Rob, \"explaining\" to any customer about an inconvenience regarding a poor experience is pointless and comes across as if you lack any compassion. Guest perception is reality in this business as I'm sure you know. I don't like to plug the fact that I am in the restaurant business because who cares, but I feel the need to share with you my side of things. 
    In regards to the fire hazards in your restaurant you should stand proud in your staff being diligent about compliance.  However,  let's not embelish, the main side of your patio was over crowded with a large party which was far more hazardous than the 8 foot wide space to walk past our table once we were seated at the converted 2 top. Also by no means we're we in any way compromising safety of our family or anyone else in the restaurant. Remember it's 74 degrees outside and 6 o'clock on a Friday in April in Scottsdale, if you have the space available accommodate your guests. Don't excuse your oversight with a fire regulation it comes across a bit insulting. 
   In regards to the crayon policy no big deal there , it was just wierd and awkward to be given crayons to my 3 year old daughter which is a nice touch but then have them taken away. Once again it was 74 degrees outside and the sun was setting I'm certain there wasn't going to be an issue with melting. It's not my place and I really don't care about the crayons but because we were put off by the situation maybe you could educate your staff on when it might be appropriate to offer crayons on the patio. Take into consideration of outdoor temperature and follow through with proper cleaning after the guests leave you might be able to avoid the melted crayon problems.  Really though I dont care about the crayons it was just an uncomfortable experience for us. 
    Lastly Rob, owning your mistakes and learning from them are some of the most valuable lessons we have in this business.  I urge you to avoid standing behind arbitrary rules and instead treat situations with a little more common sense. Take note that your restaurant's food that night was subpar (which we didnt even get all the food we ordered) and should be addressed. No one ever in that moment acted as if they cared, and we left hungry and terrribly unsatisfied. 
   Again I'm not sure why I'm going at lengths to share this with you. Maybe it's because I love hospitality. Anyway I'm done with picassos but I maybe i can leave you with sime advice. Allow the customer to be comfortable,  be hospitable and genuine,  serve good food that you have tasted and when you make a mistake own it. Empathy goes a long way in this business.  I hope this comment serves you well.
Good luck..."}
{"text":"Well I had a fruit fly in my drink. Pizza was too spicy. Salad was brown. Charged me again for my drink. Mats flying around. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Picazzo's. Not only do they make and succeed with an effort at organic and earth friendly on the menu, the menu itself is printed on recycled paper with soy based ink. 
The wine list is pretty good, but if you are a BIG Italian red fan you will have to settle for their milder organic wines. 
The crust on the pizzas are delicious and don't forget to try the cookie/ice cream desserts. 
If you love salads- their Greek one is terrific. 
If you need wheat free or other special food needs, this is a great place to go. 
This place may not be appropriate for people who want salty, run of the mill cheap food. If you want a step above, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Great option for pizza, pasta, and salads if you're gluten-free, or even if you're not. The sides were especially good with the garlicky spinach and curry cauliflower being favorites. But best of all the was the excellent service. Our server, Andrew, was extremely attentive and personable. He made the night!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and there are many gluten-free options. Upon check-in with YELP my friend and I were given an order of free cheesy bread! It was delicious. We ordered the lunch special of half salad and a slice of gluten-free pizza. It was equally delicious.  My friend treated me to lunch here for my birthday today we were given a free dessert of a warm chocolate chip cookie and ice cream. The service was phenomenal! Thank you to our server Beth for helping to make this birthday celebration so fun."}
{"text":"Love this place, we come here several times a month, why?  because it's organic and fresh!  And it is one of the places the whole family can agree to going!"}
{"text":"This review update is overdue - I did receive a follow up email and had a very productive exchange with the manager. They credited me for my order and apologized. I have been back several times since then, and they appear to have fixed the underlying issues with service. The waitstaff has been prompt and polite and the orders have been correct. On the instances in which I've done phone orders, the time estimates have been accurate. I appreciate that they listen to their customers and respond to feedback. The changes they've made are a huge improvement, and I will continue dining there regularly."}
{"text":"If you work in this area, Picazzo's is a great place to grab lunch with a co-worker.  It has a nice atmosphere and they can get you in and out in about 40-45 minutes.  It's a popular lunch spot because it has inexpensive lunch specials (Drink, pizza slice and gourmet salad combo for $9) and its gluten free pizzas.   You get a handful of options for the lunch slices, but they always have at least a veggie, a meat and a gluten free pizza ready.   I like the specials because it forces me to try something that I may not have chosen otherwise.  The entire pizza menu looks great though, I would like to try it when I'm not on my lunch hour!"}
{"text":"We loved the wine selection with sustainable wines. There was a huge array of options. We chose the brussels sprouts with bacon, chicken wings which were extremely spicy but delicious, and pulled pork with spinach. I travel a lot and love to find healthy organic restaurants so I am very happy with this place"}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  Lunchtime the place fills up fast.  I had the italian chopped salad and had them substitute with kale (which they'll do for any salad, no charge).  Yum.  Don't get put off by all the gluten free, organic verbiage all over the menu.  The food is GOOD.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I recently came here for lunch.  I thought the service was fine- they refilled my drink frequently and were polite.  I ordered the farmhouse salad and added chicken.  The half salad was good, but small (not too much of an issue for me as I think most portions are too large in restaurants) but nothing terribly amazing, the ingredients seemed fresh, and the dressing was good.  As someone who doesn't have gluten issues and eats meat, I wouldn't come back, as my half salad with chicken (and I had water to drink) was over $13 before tip!  Considering I have very few dietary restrictions, I just don't see the value!"}
{"text":"Love Picazzo's! Their gluten-free pizza crust is very good..you would never know it's GF. And their GF pastas are awesome also...not mushy the way GF pastas tend to turn out a lot of the time.  The Greek salad is also one of my favorites. It's so great to be able to go to a restaurant and order anything on the menu and know it can be made GF and have lots of flavor. Servers are always very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. Great place!"}
{"text":"All things in life and in universe change. Eventually. After the restaurant went through transformation in redoing menu items and recipes, the TASTE is NOT what it used to be. The staff and the service is still good to excellent. Hence, 2 stars rather than just 1.

In addition, the price increase is beyond significant. $18+ for a 12\" 1-topping pizza on any given day is excessive. By the time you add a beverage, you are looking easily at $20+ per person. If you have alcoholic beverage, than it's $27+ per person."}
{"text":"My sister and I took my mother to Picazzos since she is currently on a gluten-free diet. I have been there before 3 other times and the food is always really good and since they have a lot of gluten free options to choose from, it seemed the ideal choice. My sister and I ordered a pizza to share which we specified to have no onions (the sis is a picky eater) and my mom ordered a gluten-free pasta entree. We also ordered some spinach dip and foccacia for appetizers because we were starving. The appetizers took forever to arrive (Like literally other people got their orders, ate, chatted, and then paid and left before our apps came) and came literally two minutes before the food and the pizza came with onions. We let our server know and she offered my sister a small personal pizza instead. We finished our appetizers and by the time my sister's personal size pizza arrived, we were ready to get the bill and go. When it came time for the bill, our server had no idea how to deal with the cost of the pizza we did not like and had to walk away again to figure it out with the manager. She ended up taking off the cost of the small personal pizza, which was fine except the original pizza that was only missing 2 slices, was twice as much money. Overall, I gave this place 3 stars because my mom LOVED her pasta and dinner was really about her anyway. Normally, I am not a complainer about service or food, but with Picasso's prices, their customer service and overall efficiency should be much better."}
{"text":"This was my first time here today as well as my boyfriend's. I thought this place was great! The idea of gluten free, vegan, non GMO and organic can scare some people or put them off, but honestly - Picazzo's does these options SO well. You wouldn't even know that these things are gluten free or vegan or whatever else. The prices are worth it, given that you get to customize your food to your options (allergies, organic, gluten free, vegan, non GMO, etc.) and that the food is fresh and good FOR you. I didn't leave here feeling sick or bloated or so full I wanted to nap and that tells you something. The service is great too! Our waiter (a young man, can't exactly remember his name) was wonderful; checked on us multiple times, answered all of our questions and was just friendly in general when making conversation with us. Delicious, good for you and stellar service. We are already planning our next outing here!"}
{"text":"Came back after a month since my first time bad experience... they deff made up for it and they deff have great food. They know it so it's not cheap but not over priced, I love the vegan options, I'm already planning on coming back for certain menu items   highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"The pizza lacked toppings severely, with only a small pile in the middle of the slice. It was also dry. The salads were good but were ALL lettuce, not much else then a cucumber slice and two small tomatoes. Upon my request for extra salad dressing I was told \"no.\" 

The counter girl must be new because she had no idea what she was doing and was not polite in the slightest. She gave me overflowing sodas which spilled all over the counter and I had to ask multiple times for napkins to wipe off the access soda.

For a small slice of pizza and salad, the cost was $14.

Go to Barros across the street, save a few bucks and enjoy your lunch!"}
{"text":"Love, love love the new menu as of March 2015.  Mu Shu Chicken and Spicy Thai Peanut pasta bowls are phenomenal...and VEGAN options.  This place is so amazing for celiac, gluten intolerant, vegetarian, and vegan guests.  I wish I could eat here every day.  There aren't enough stars for the rating."}
{"text":"This is great. Everyone is friendly. Food is great and they are able to carter to what you like. We went during happy hour, delicious white sangria and meatballs instead of focaccia bread they substituted carrots. Wings were good too."}
{"text":"First time at this Picazzo's. We've been to the one in Sedona and had a good meal. This was even better. 

We arrived around 2:00PM on a Monday and there were about seven other parties of tables, so we were seated right away and were given our choice of patio, bar or restaurant. 

Our server, Cynthia, was busy with another order so another server gave us lemon water and asked us to wait. Nice touch. 

We ordered the lunch specials and both got pizza and salad.  My wife ordered the gluten free/dairy free pizza slice with pepperoni and mushrooms with a garden salad plus Chardonnay. I got the pepperoni slice with a wedge salad and lemonade. 

Lunch arrived in 12 minutes, pizza and salad on the same plate. It was fine because the plate was big enough. 

Both pizzas were a good size, hot with good crust, sauce and toppings. The salads were cold, fresh and crisp. 

Overall, $31.90 for a very filling, sumptuous meal. I highly recommend Piccazo's."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for lunch.  The lunch combos are great choice for lunch and the price includes your drink.  I always get a slice of pizza and a salad... it is plenty of food.  Today it was a pepperoni slice and the chopped Italian salad.  very good.  They have a huge menu and I wish I could say that I would try many things, but the reality is that I don't live near here and I only come for lunch.  The specials work for me."}
{"text":"Today my friend and I came for lunch and drinks. We arrived and we sat at bar. The service was fantastic however the food was sub par and we had to both ask for extra sauce which took more than 15 mins to revive because the chef burned first round of extra sauce. So after receiving Sauce the food was a little better. However not sure I would return based on food. However if it was based on service I highly recommend the service."}
{"text":"First visit - FIVE stars. 
Second visit - TWO stars.

What happened? Our first visit, it was excellent, food, drinks, service, wait time was acceptable, service was prompt. It was one of the best dinning experience (portion, taste, healthiness, ambiance).

Second time? Well, the order was fast, the waitress was prompt and it didn't take more than 5 minutes to get our order in after we sat down. However, the kitchen was awfully behind. We sat near the kitchen and I saw dishes brought back to the kitchen, waiters/ waitress commending dishes to be done asap. It's not the waitress' fault, I understand. However, with a hungry 7-year old child, we waited, waited, and then waited more. She could have offered some bread or dinner rolls, knowing that the kitchen was having serious problems. Or, at least, she could have told us that the kitchen was having trouble and the service was SLOW. So we could decide if we wait or leave. In addition, her manner was impatient, unwilling, and unfriendly at the end. 

The food was okay this time: portion was inconsistent, sauce was still very 
good. Not going back until they solve the \"kitchen\" problem. Sigh."}
{"text":"I came in because I always hear about their gluten free pizza.

The menu was slightly confusing, I ordered a slice of what I presumed was gluten free pizza ($4 about for the slice). After waiting a good 20 minutes, I received the pizza and started walking out the door. My wife had the genius idea to confirm that it was gluten free - which I specifically requested when I ordered it - well, what do you know, it wasn't gluten free.. 

Thanks for nothing!!

It's hard to think about coming back to an expensive - possibly overpriced - restaurant that gives off a bad vibe..

I may stop by sometime to try it out, haven't made a final decision yet.."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the hell-good Chicken Piccata.  You can request it dairy, egg and gluten free.  And guess what, it still tastes good!  I love the Vegan Gluten free Pita Bread.  The lunch specials are great and you can get them on the weekend as well.  The lunch specials come with a beverage (organic hot coffee is great too) and a side salad.  I can feed my baby who has food allergies here because I know he can eat what I am eating!  Win all around."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch after hearing several good things about Picazzo's. I was impressed with the decor, it was nothing like I had imagined. It was cute and welcoming. I ordered the salad/pasta lunch special and paid the extra buck for a specialty salad. I went with the chopped italian and it was really good. Perfect amount of dressing and all the things you expect on a chopped salad. I paired it with the spaghetti and chicken picatta which was ok. I didn't really taste any picatta flavor, and it was drenched in oil. I actually ended up with some oil on my shirt, which NEVER comes out for me.  All in all it was a good portion of food and it came with a drink and was a pretty good value. I will have to return to try the pizza and other pasta options, but they definitely sold me on the chopped salad!"}
{"text":"My mom and I dined in to Picazzos for dinner tonight because we were craving pizza and wine. Our server was David and he was one of the best servers I've had in quite a long time. He was very welcoming the second we arrived, apologized for our drinks taking an extra few minutes and he went above and beyond for our dining experience. I love how easy he was to talk to and he even cracked a few jokes. It's hard to get good service nowadays so having David as our server was definitely was a delight. If you're going to Picazzos, please sit in David's section! He is truly incredible and Picazzo is lucky to have him."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. I ordered half size of the Heart Healthy Salad with optional chicken.  Since I am trying to track my macros it is really great to order something fresh and you can see what you are eating to track. The salad was fresh and super tasty. The staff was friendly and gave me a water to go. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"WARNING: This place is fantastic but ONLY if you dine in! I ordered a chicken kale salad to go, and they charged me $17 and gave me half of what they would have if I had dined in. Full price but half the serving. Bad business! Get larger take out containers! I will go to the Frank Lloyd Wright location near our house, but we've gone here when we go to the Mall."}
{"text":"I want to give this 4 stars and would have if I'd written this review last year. I've been eating at Picazzo's for many years, both this location and the other one in Scottsdale.  Things have changed a bit over the past year that have frustrated me and took my rating down a star.

Over the years it has evolved to be a sort of healthy food driven concept which I like. I like gluten free and other attempts to serve quality food. I don't like the sometimes small portions and extremely high prices.  I tend to always get the lunch special of a pizza slice and salad. Salad is always great - I get the Chopped Italian. The pizza on the other hand goes from good to bad, just depends. Sometimes the piece is an ok size, fluffy and crispy crust, good amount of pepperoni. Today I was there with a friend and the slice was teeny, tiny and so thin I thought is was a pizza from Sauce.  It was a joke for a slice.  The special includes a drink, but my salad is an upgrade so overall it is about $13.25.

My friend liked her meal, but it was $16.00 and a bit more than what she wanted to spend. 

They have a loyalty program that gets you a $10.00 credit for every $125.00 you spend. It is at least something to reward you for going there.

I wish they'd give some bread out with the full size salads but was told because of the focus on health they don't do it.  Weird, I saw someone order cheesy bread as an appetizer today so how is that healthy?  They also recently changed the dressing to my go-to salad and I don't like the new one. They made the old one thicker in texture and it is now kind of gross. Hey - it is ain't broke don't fix it!  Bring back the old dressing for the chopped italian!  These are some of the reasons my rating is what it is and not higher.

Overall it is a good place to go, but the owners need to review the feedback and perhaps make some tweaks to make it a bit better."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical going to Picazzo's when I saw that it was gluten free and organic. I expected to have limited options and tasteless food. I was completely wrong!  I was encouraged to see the place really hopping with both couples and families eating here. I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered a pepperoni pizza that my husband and I shared. However, he also ordered the Apple & Walnut Gorgonzola Salad and he's STILL talking about how great it was. When the pizza was first delivered to the table I was a bit disappointed to see the crust so thick (I prefer thin crust) because I expected it to be heavy. Again, I was wrong. The crust was light and airy and full of flavor. I never eat the ends of my pizza and I absolutely devoured it. It was served piping hot and was delicious all the way around. Our friendly server's name was Grace and she was terrific too. She made some great recommendation, she always showed up at our table about a second before we needed something and kept our drinks full. I cannot wait to go back here again and try something else. My only complaint is that I wish they were in Mesa! We drove 20 minutes to this place because we had a Groupon. But now that we discovered it we'll definitely be back. Loved the entire experience!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and interesting pasta.  Good wine by the glass choices.  Excellent spinach salad.  Family friendly as well."}
{"text":"It is not easy to find a quality Italian restaurant when you are on vacation. I can say that I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing quality on display at Picazzo's restaurant. Their gluten-free options are extensive and delicious. The lasagna is spectacular and be sure to have the chicken wing appetizer. Best we ever had. Throw in exemplary service and Picazzo's has a sure winner."}
{"text":"We were excited to see Picasso's after having it in Sedona for the first time and loved it. But we were extremely disappointed in the service and the food. We ordered two pizzas and a pasta dinner to go. After 15 minutes one pizza was brought out and placed behind the counter. Five more minutes and the other pizza comes out and placed w the other and both sat for another five minutes until I had to ask if our food was ready only to be told that they were waiting on the pasta dinner. I asked if they could keep the pizza hot in the mean time. We waiting 15 more minutes for the pasta dinner and got home to two cold under cooked pizzas that tasted like crap. We threw both away because they were falling apart and soggy. Worst expensive dinner I've ever had. I will never be back, never."}
{"text":"I have lived right around the corner from this place and never gave it a try until last week.  After trying it out, I can say that I will be eating here a lot more often.  There are lots of options for everyone!  I loved it."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW:  This was a 4-star review, and now it's a 2-star review. For the 5TH time, we have ordered take-out from picazzos and gotten the wrong food. Not only am I upset that it's the wrong order, but we specifically order VEGAN every time we go there, because we do not eat animal products. Please don't offer vegan if you can't take it as seriously as vegans do. This time we got REAL chicken in our meal!! Luckily I can tell the moment I see it that it's real chicken. We always double-check to make sure they confirm that they heard \"vegan option\" when we specify. This is not only offensive to the vegan community, but it is sickening that we had to go hungry for lunch because your employees don't take the time to listen and double check orders before sending us out the door. I absolutely will never order take-out again  from picazzos Tempe. As a repeat long-term customer who has been coming to your restaurant for over 4 years, I will not recommend picazzos to my vegan friends EVER again (and I have fed over 20 people at this restaurant over the years). The only reason I'm not giving a 1-star review is because dine-in service is good (when the food is vegan).

Original review:
I really love the vegan gluten free options here.  When dining in, I always have great experience with the food.  Ordering take-out is not great here.  I have been overcharged, given the wrong pizza, and only given half the portion size of pasta that I would get if I dined in (yet paid the same high price).  I was even given nearly raw flatbread instead of fully baked bread. I would be happier to wait 45min to pick up my food if it meant better quality and larger portions that are worth the price.  Please take your time with takeout orders and don't worry about competing with low-end pizza shops on pick-up times, nobody else offers organic gluten free so you don't need to rush to get it done."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give this place more stars. I've had the food at its Tempe, Paradise Valley and Scottsdale locations. I was looking forward to a Picazzo's on this end of town. We have dined in once sitting on the patio and have mostly ordered out. The consistency seems to be lacking in the kitchen at this location. The GF crust was good initially but now it's gritty and so thin that it falls apart before you can take a bite. The kids pizza has so much garlic in the sauce that it's too spicy for the kids. The salads are ok, something I can make at home. But portions are large and easy to share. Wings are delicious. The GFDF cheesecake is amazing but is a small slice and that's not a problem since it is rich and tastes like the real thing. The pizza, gluten free or not, is mediocre. We have had the thai pasta dish and it was dry.  Nick is an amazing man and is a really nice guy. The other manager covering for him was a complete (insert expletive) to one of the other workers there that it simply made me uncomfortable.  Sorry, I just can't support a place that tolerates abuse.  I can get gluten free, dairy free, organic when in season/local produce pizza at the pizza place just the next exit down."}
{"text":"Had a real problem first time we ate here and posted how lousy it was. Management contacted us and asked us to give them one more try. Wow...are we glad we did. After several visits never had a bad meal again. Their Pizza is superb. Excellent salads also.  
Best pizza in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I finally had something that I could eat! As a strict GF follower, it's beyond refreshing to visit a quality restaurant that not only caters to my dietary restrictions but embraces it. The hummus appetizer is a good choice (maybe i'm biased because it was so refreshing to be able to eat the freshly baked, warm focaccia bread). Of course I had to get a pizza on the GF crust. Can't go wrong with any of the pizza toppings, and don't be afraid to try an option that's out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"This is a great gluten free restaurant! Delicious food, I had a pasta and the garlic cheese bread, both of which were amazing. Even my husband, who isn't gluten free, enjoyed his meal. Also a alot of vegan/ dairy free options! It's so nice to have a place to go to where I can actually eat any of the desserts on the menu!"}
{"text":"(Update at bottom) First I have to say that my husband and I frequent Picazzo's and love their happy hour! 

Recently we've noticed a decline/change in a few items that make us very sad. Their meatballs used to be our favorite and we would come just for them. The last 2 times we've gone, they were MUCH smaller and almost taste frozen. Im not sure why they changed it.....maybe cost? Second was their flatbread with dates, Fuji apple and Prosciutto. The flat bread was doubled up and not cooked evenly and the prosciutto was gummy and fatty, not crispy as usual. Hmmmmm I sure hope this place isn't going down hill. One of our favs!

Update- food seems to be back on the incline :) thanks for listening guys! Last few visits were great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Tried the pear gorgonzola salad and the lamb chevre pizza tonight, and both were wonderful. Some of the freshest food I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Picazzo's.  I don't remember what their pizza is like because it has been so long since I had it, but if there is one thing I always remember, it is their salads.  They are HUGE and awesome.  I absolutely love their wedge.  I swear the small is an entire head of lettuce.  Anyway, this Picassos seems to have the same stuff as all the rest around town and their service staff is just as helpful and friendly as the other locations.

This place is great if you care about organic, gluten free, blah blah blah stuff.  I don't really care about that stuff but I guess it is a plus when I'm chowing down on a wedge the size of my head.

Also, the Mama's Meat-Za Balls are just 'eh.  The meat is nitrate free so maybe that's why I didn't like them so much cuz I love me some nitrates.  They are worth a shot but this is not one of their better appetizers.

Anyway, I love this place and hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great (and healthy) food, reasonable prices, specially for organic and glue free foods!  The only knock is that portions are on the small size, we have a teenage boy and he was left hungry..."}
{"text":"So excited that Picazzo's has come to Glendale! Visited with my husband on Friday. Nice atmosphere. They just opened, so wait staff and kitchen staff were getting into their groove, as was expected. They were all very nice. The spinach artichoke dip was phenomenal, as was their fresh focaccia. My husband had the eggplant Parmesan which he enjoyed. I had the chicken piccata, which was disappointing( 3-4 tiny pieces of flavorless chicken, tons of capers, no lemon flavor, and a ton of oil). I'm going to try BBQ chicken pizza next time! I wish their tiramisu was not made with raw eggs. I would have liked to try that, but Salmonella is no joke. No idea why they can't just use pasteurized eggs and eliminate that risk altogether.....apple crisp sounded good but worried about it containing oats, which are off limits for some with celiac disease. So skipped dessert, but that's ok. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Was picazzo's, then buon gusto, now back to picazzos. Same great food! Gluten free options if needed or wanted. Most dishes organic. Happy hour on a Sunday till 6! Friendly service. Usually short or no wait."}
{"text":"Service was really poor. Food was just okay and my party of 6 ordered a variety of items. Avocado toast had way too much arugula and very little avocado. Pasta Louis was pretty decent if you're looking for something spicy the Italian sausage was good. Turkey meatballs and rigatoni or average very little flavor. Chicken Alfredo was just OK, again very little to no flavor. Caesar salad is a Caesar salad no matter where you are. The pizza was really decent. The focaccia bread was not at all what we expected there was no seasoning no flavor on it whatsoever. By Italian standards less than poor rating."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty, I had no idea the pasta (creamy tomato basil bolognese) was gluten free until I realized pretty much everything on the menu is. Also, the raspberry limeade was delicious! Probably one of the best and most refreshing drinks I've had in a while. My issue with the restaurant was that they had one employee doing everything; serving, bartending, hosting, and bussing. Meanwhile, there were at least 3 other workers in the back talking while the poor guy was running the whole restaurant. I wasn't annoyed because the service was slow, but simply because all duties of the front end of a restaurant should not be performed by one member of the team, because they are unable to provide the service they likely have the potential to do."}
{"text":"Incredible experience, literally got emotional and felt things while I was eating the gluten free and vegan sweet potato pie pizza. Literally cannot possibly recommend it enough, a top 5 eating experience ever, and food is my life. Please go and just close your eyes and enjoy everything the food does to you!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a vegan pizza and salad with a friend here. It was SO delicious and perfectly satisfying. The environment is trendy and welcoming. I am so glad we chose this for a fun dinner with friends!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dessert and wine last night with my lady.  Our server Allison had a wonderful personality and was fun to interact with and so was the bus boy.  Any who, I don't know if it's a every Saturday night thing but the wine bottles were 50% off. We had a Pinot bottled by Natura. I'm not much of a wine connoisseur but discovered taking little sips is best. We ordered the chocolate brownie with coconut ice cream and tiramisu.  My lady said it's the best brownie she has ever eaten, it was pretty good. It's denseness was right between the really chewy brownies we love and Angel food cake, it was smack dab in the middle.  The coconut ice cream was wonderful as well, I couldn't taste any coconut.  I felt \"naughty\" eating it.  I had the tiramisu all to myself."}
{"text":"Ok the name sounds interesting but how much is too much?  We went in on a early Friday night. Ordered the California pizza. Really good!  Large house salad is big enough for two but when I ask for avocado topping, I think $2.00 ought to get me more than a quarter avocado. Mac n chz good.  Moscow mule not too strong for $9.00. Server was good, but the timing on food was sub par.  Be patient it taste good for another try."}
{"text":"Nice that they have a huge gluten free selection.  However, I am not gluten free and would prefer more of a non gluten free selection.

The menu is super expensive.

Happy Hour is the only time I would eat here.  Appetizers are 1/2 off and alcoholic drinks are $1 off.    With Happy Hour pricing a friend and I shared a caprese and I had a peach bellini and she had a glass of cabernet.  The bill was $25, with tip.  I think that is pricey!!!

The caprese was good except for the bread.  Not a fan at all.  The peach bellini was DELICIOUS!!

We liked sitting out on the patio on a Friday night but the service was super slow to start out and tons of kids running around."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the juice bar! They use organic produce to make some healthy juices. I love the Beet Cazo (with spinach and parsley added). The prices might seem a bit high, but I'm not sure I could make my own juice on a daily basis for much less."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the wide variety menu at Picazzo's. I went in on a Sunday evening for \"healthy hour\". The restaurant is adorably decorated and they have popular music playing in the dinning and bar area. My husband and I ordered the cheese bread appetizer, which was a great light choice before our meals. I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza with chipotle sauce it was phenomenal and very filling I ended up taking half of it home. My husband ordered the meaty meaty pizza with gluten free crust and said he could tell it was made with high quality ingredients. We will definitely be back to try other item menu. The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is the price for the two pizza, appetizer (at\"healthy hour\" rate), glass of rosé wine, and a corona was over $55. You definitely pay for the healthier ingredients and gluten free items."}
{"text":"So happy they returned to the NW Valley! And the menu is so much better. Gluten free heaven so my patients will be learning about this place soon! Great service and delicious food. I love their happy hours and salads! It's conveniently off loop 101 and is our new favourite staff lunch  spot! 
You may think gluten free means boring and limited food choices. Think again. 
If they didn't label the menu items, you wouldn't know."}
{"text":"Healthnut salad... delish! Hot chipolte wings... delish!  cucumber breeze or something like that drink... delish!  good happy hour... I forget the hours now...  check the website.  spinach artchoke dip... ehhh... didn't care for it.  Pizza... not bad.  Love the wings... love the health nut salad...  drinks.. yummy too.  Gluten free options... with pasta!  I've had that too... Some sort of spicy chicken pasta...  all organic, can work gluten free...  pretty good...we will go back many times."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I love that they have options for people who aren't gluten free or vegan as well as those who are. The fig Gorgonzola pizza is delicious and so is the new spicy Thai red coconut curry pizza. This is a great place to go for lunch or with friends for dinner. They also have a juice bar and many of their ingredients are local."}
{"text":"The place was easy to find, we were seated very quickly. Friendly staff, service was great and the good was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for the health nut, gluten free dieters, and vegetarians but not limited to these groups of people. They have great pizza with three choices of crusts-super healthy, gluten free, and regular. They have a full bar with great wine, craft beer and a cocktail menu. The restaurant is divided into a dining area, a bar/lounge, and a patio. There was also a juice bar which I did not try.

My bf and I started with the melted Brie. I'll warn you, it's very garlicky! I personally loved the fresh baked garlic submerged in my cheese but some might not.

My boyfriend had the Deldiablo pizza. This has a good kick and wasn't too spicy. I had a half pancetta gorgonzola and half fig arugula. The pancetta was ok but the fig pizza tasted like dessert! Highly recommend for the pizza lover with a sweet tooth! 

The only improvement I can recommend for this place is the service. It was a tad slow but our server was sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is by far...my favorite restaurant! My wife and I eat here very regularly. The staff is amazing! We know just about everyone that works here because they actually take the time to really get to know their customers. Great food, great customer service and great experience every time! Everything you eat here is either Local, Organic, Gluten Free, Non GMO or all of the above! You'll love here it here and I guarantee you'll remember it and come back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pasta I've ever tasted! I had the Jambalaya pasta and my wife had the Mu Shu Chicken and we shared......outstanding and gluten free! The wait staff was on their game. The manager even came up to our table and asked how our meal was. Just overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"I had a well made mojito. Aside from that, this meal was exceptionally bad. Very little attention was received from the server, although the restaurant was practically empty. The meals took an average time to prepare, but even the appearance was unappetizing. Only recently have it started eating gluten free because my gf has a food allergy, but even at this stage, I know better than to think gluten free food has to taste bad. The Eggplant Parmesan was bad. There was an excess of sauce. The eggplant was raw and stale tasting. It was served with burnt bread. The dish was small, and the price was high. 

Finally, after trudging through this debacle of a restaurant experience, the server brought our bill and informed us that we wouldn't be able to order dessert because the kitchen was already closed. How do you explain closing the kitchen in a restaurant before the guests leave or before 9? 

Oh, I forgot to mention the atmosphere was decent. 

All in all, two badly prepared meals, a decent mojito and mediocre service ended up running almost forty dollars. I recommend wary eaters steer clear of this unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"We only have two stars due to the fact that the food is pretty pedestrian and way over priced for what you get.
We were looking for a new place to go so we have this place a try. Sad to say it did not live up to what the menu said.
The turkey meatballs were beyond dry. They must have been sitting in sauce foe a very long time.
Asian chicken salad only had three small pieces of chicken. Pretty sad. We will not be coming back or referring them to anyone."}
{"text":"Best gluten free food! Awesome happy hour, gluten free appetizers, pizza, salads... awesome everything. Love that I don't have to worry about what I'm eating here, basically everything is gluten free! Love all their locations, great restaurant."}
{"text":"First time there a couple weeks ago to the Tempe location. The food was indeed absolutely amazing, and the environment is super-nice! As celiacs, my daughter and I have gone to so many places and had their GF dishes. Some good, some not so much. This one is REALLY awesome. We both had the Creamy Tomato Bolognese. The noodles tasted \"real\" -- but actually way better than any wheat noodle I've ever had. 

The price was a little expensive, $17.50 a meal (not sure I agree with yelp's $$ rating). The only down side was that our portions were very small. Perhaps that's why I say that it was expensive. I see that other people think opposite. (?) Perhaps we came on a bad day? We are both around 120 lbs., and this was the first time we both said to each other that we were actually still hungry after dining. lol

Otherwise, I would give this place 6 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food. So many options and healthy enough to indulge without feeling bad. Service is attentive and super nice. The place is clean and has a lot of good energy. We had the vegan chicken tenders and the spicy peanut Thai chicken rotini. Vegan tenders tasted like ribs which was actually unexpected but very good. The peanut Thai pasta dish was excellent. Not spicy at all. Super super good! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here the other day and was so happy with the great food and service! I love that this place is organic, vegan and gluten free! It's very clean inside and has a pleasant atmosphere too. I wish this place was closer to me but maybe it's a good thing that it's not lol. I will definitely be back to try more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant that offers the option of whole grain pizza crust!! Yeah!! This place re-invented itself several years ago and now emphasizes their organic, gluten-free, etc. offerings. But, you don't have to be a 'health nut' or have health issues to enjoy this place. The atmosphere is nice, the staff friendly, and overall, the food is good and always very fresh. This visit we decided to create our own Neapolitan pizza - a fun way to try different ingredients together - like artichoke hearts and sausage. It was actually pretty good! Our waiter was a bit pushy at first as we took our time deciding on what wine to order, but once that was settled, he only checked in periodically to make sure everything was OK. Nice little place - we'll return."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time years ago and found myself in the same neighborhood today and got really excited to be having lunch there. The menu went through a complete change since the last time I was here, in fact this might not even be the same restaurant anymore. I don't have anything against healthy or organic foods but I'm sad to say I will not be back. Outrageously overpriced,  small portions and just not very good at all. Bland,  boring, bird food."}
{"text":"7/16/16 7:00pm we ordered a gluten free pizza the person that answered the phone sounded like a idiot. We picked it up got home the pizza didn't have any sauce on it? We called to talk to the manager waited 15 minutes who ended up being a rude idiot. We demanded a refund and after 20 minutes the idiot stated she would reverse the charge and hung the phone in my face! The food is horrible, the staff are rude, they will scam you! For this they get what they deserve 1 star and if I could give zero stars I would. Do not trust this pizza joint they will rip you off."}
{"text":"Sure lets try throwing that on a pizza, why not.

That is the approach taken at Picazzo's.  While they do offer  a mundane Margarita pizza on the menu here, that is not the thing to try. As far as their crust it is decent but far from perfect.

One of my favorite pizzas is the quarto fomarggi, (four cheeses for the Italian challenged) has Gorgonzola cheese, Alfredo, mozzarella, cherve (goat) and Fontina. the high fat of the fonina makes a smooth melt right into the Alfredo while the pungent cherve and strong flavor of the Gorgonzola are quite present. This is topped with basil and pears that really complement the mould cheese.

The inside of the location is decent, it mostly has tables a few booths and a new expanded bar. There also is a large patio with parking lot views for the cooler weather."}
{"text":"Ok lunch special  Slice of pizza, salad and drink $10.  Gluten free cheese pizza and organic caesar salad. Ehhh......what did I expect, pretty bland. BUT I didn't feel guilty walking out of there. Good with the bad."}
{"text":"Fresh, organic and tasty! Enjoyed lunch. yesterday and couldn't be more pleased. Great  waitstaff and the Asian crunch salad was perfection. So many healthy items to choose from! This wii be one of my top favs from now on"}
{"text":"Its really sad because i was looking forward to ordering from their extensive gluten free menu BUT we never got the chance.  We entered the restaurant at lunchtime on a Saturday and there was no Hostess which is not a big problem so we seated ourselves at the bar. We looked around there was no bartender. So we waited for a server or bartender to greet us or mention a server was coming.  There were other people seated in the restaurant and on the patio that were being serviced; after 10 minutes no one had greeted us or even offered us a water.   We looked around again trying to get someone's attention to no avail so we made the decision to leave. As we were leaving two more people were coming in the door at that point a Hostess walked over and greeted them but never said anything to us. It was bizarre and just terrible service."}
{"text":"My husband and I both thought the food was great.  And how amazing that its organic and gluten free!  Perfect for the health food nuts out there!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I liked Italian food before coming here. With dairy and egg allergies, eating Italian is nearly impossible and I'm always stuck eating some sad salad with nothing but leaves, oil and vinegar. BUT NOT HERE. WOWZAHS! I became obsessed with this place after a friend took me to the Sedona location and I fell in love with it.

The pizzas are fantastic and allow me to do vegan cheese with meat to accommodate my allergies. The crust is amazing--even my anti-vegan-food-fiance thought it was decent, which says a TON. I loved the BBQ chicken pizza and the cranberry jalapeno hummus is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Try it with the gluten free/vegan flatbread - it's super delicious and you'd never even know it was gluten-less.

The wings were a little bit too spicy and my moscow mule was a little too strong for my liking, but not enough knock it any stars. 

The vegan cheezcake is pretty dandy too! If you check in to yelp while you're there, a free coupon for one just might appear."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times.  The first time was during the Superbowl in 2009 and the second time last June.  The pizza is quite delicious with the organic ingredients as well as the gluten-free pizza crust.  The overall taste is clever; I mean that it is good, but for some reason my instincts do not realize it is pizza.  The concept is to far removed from the traditional pie (e.g. the toppings and combinations are unique).  

I enjoyed the dining experience, but the atmosphere was somewhat drab and stuffy.  The service was mediocre.  I would round up to a four star from about a three and three quarters."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch - the service was very slow ... I'm sure the waiter could have saved himself some time and combined trips.  I couldn't help but notice that the managers were truckin' all over the place filling drinks and running plates.  I just think the staff can use some training ...

Food was okay.  I didn't like the Caesar salad - very weak.  But my Italian Sandwich was decent.  Didn't get offered dessert ... so didn't try it.  Just a bleak experience."}
{"text":"Picazzo's is one of my favorite pizza spots for years. Recently, I decide to order healthy and went for one of their salads...the spicy Southwestern Chicken. It was excellent, but when in Rome. Yeah....stick with the pizza. These guys make 5-6 killer pizzas depending on what you are hungry for. 
The ingredients are organic and they offer a gluten-free crust."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place for the first time. We are not gluten-free or vegan, but we believe in supporting organic restaurants.

First off, I was pretty shocked by how expensive everything was.  The gourmet pizzas were outrageous.  So, we decided to just order a sausage pizza with the whole-grain crust. Despite the fact that it was 645 on a Friday evening, we were told they were out of the whole-grain crust. We were offered gluten-free and vegan alternatives. I explain to them that we were not gluten-free nor were we vegan so we did not want those crusts but that we would go ahead and just order the original.

We got the pizza to go. It took 15 minutes to get our order which was more than reasonable. However, it was not even worth the short wait. The crust had a weird taste and texture. Not sure if we somehow ended up with a gluten-free crust but it was very unpleasant.  It left an aftertaste that lingered and lingered.  The sauce and cheese tasted fine however, there was hardly any sausage on the pizza. Maybe 2 to 3 pieces per slice. Definitely not worth the $20 we paid. 

We also ordered the Italian chopped salad.  The half-size was plenty for two people to share along with the pizza. However, the tomatoes were soft and mealy, Again, just really unpleasant. Kind of ruined the salad for both of us.  We will not be back.

edited to add that both my daughter and I ended up feeling sick all night long.  Stomach cramps and more.  Without getting graphic, it was a pretty rough night.  Now I'm wondering if that strange taste the pizza had was because something was off?"}
{"text":"Good gluten free option for pizza. We discovered this place when we thought I had a gluten allergies. Decent cocktails and a nice atmosphere. Service can be a little slow but I enjoy their pizza so worth it to me."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! We loved all the healthy food choices! They have gluten free pizza crusts, vegan options, zoodles, so many healthy choices! The food was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for something not to heavy. Pleasantly surprised that the menu had so many healthy options. The food was great! The bartender was very friendly. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed dinner here. She ordered the chicken piccata, and thought it was good. She is very Italian, so that is saying something ;) I was very excited about the menu because there are so many vegetarian options! I had the seven veggie pasta. It came out very warm. The spices were just right. My preference is to have a lot of sauce (or gravy), and this didn't. If you like a lot too, ask for a little extra. They have a new ginger beer on the menu. It is very big (16 ounces and 48 grams of sugar), so it can be shared. It is a twist off top that wasn't opened when brought to the table. That was strange for a restaurant. Our server was a sweet girl. She was very quiet though. Didn't say anything beyond simple questions. I look forward to going back to trying all the other gluten free, veggie options."}
{"text":"Picazzo's Healthy Italian Kitchen recently opened in Glendale.  They offer Italian Style Foods with a mostly healthy twist. They cater to vegans, vegetarians, people with allergies, they offer gluten-free made foods (in a non-gluten-free environment). They also offer quality organic, non-GMO, nitrate free and so on ingredients. 

After my experience I feel that this is an excellent concept but there are some problems with execution.

The atmosphere is cute with school style chairs that sit on an old fashioned kind of retro tiny tile floor. They have interesting light fixtures. Some retro benches and a small patio. Our server was very perky and cheerful. Things were A-ok so far.

We started out with Mama's Meat-za Balls (Turkey) and some healthy Roasted Vegetables. They came out at the same time and my husband tried a meatball and told our server who was there that it was cold. She quickly brought it back to the kitchen for us. So then we moved on to the vegetables. The vegetables were pretty much raw. They seemed VERY EVER SO SLIGHTLY heated and were topped with lots of oregano. Well I guess they are healthy that way........Then the meatballs arrive. They are hot now. They are almost good.......The meatballs contain a massive amount of oregano, maybe only a trace amount of salt and pepper. The flavor is very unbalanced. Maybe if they used less oregano and added just a small amount of some other herbs the meatball could be delicious. The cooked tomatoes on top also were seasoned like the meatballs and vegetables .....topped with too much oregano and pretty much nothing else. The meatballs also came with a very strange tasting house made focaccia bread. After a bite I didn't need anymore. I didn't recognize this bread in looks or taste as focaccia.

We shared the Fig Gorgonzola Pizza. You have to eat this pizza with a knife and fork because it's made with a delicate puffy crust with a wet center. The crust almost seemed fried but wasn't crisp.......The wet sweet center was very unusual.....It was almost like a sweet filling. The crust was more sweet than savory. It's more like dessert. While it's not terrible tasting it way to sweet to be a meal. Even with the spicy arugula it wasn't enough calm down all the sweetness. I was thinking that walnuts might help. It also wasn't drizzled even with the balsamic vinegar. Some slices were drowning in it and other slices had hardly any. Not sure if they added the Gorgonzola....????? 

I think there is potential or a nice healthy great tasting meal but on my visit I experienced problems with execution that brought things down. Recipes and directions didn't seem to be followed. 

Server seemed great. She even offered us beverages to take out. No problems with service."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and have had nothing but delicious food and great service.  The staff has alway been attentive and the food is great .  It is often difficult to find a restaurant with an all organic menu. In some of the reviews people complain about the prices, but don't forget, if you go to a market and purchase organic products it is going to cost a bit more!  We prefer to pay a bit more for healthier food for our family.  We will return next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I tried their Soup and Salad combo for lunch with a friend that had the pizza slice with a salad.
She loved the pizza and the soup was pretty good....as for the salads, we had to pick around the rotted greens so I didn't enjoy it at all.
They did give me a $5 credit for the salad but I would not go back because of this experience."}
{"text":"So it's hard enough to go out and have a gluten free meal disregarding the fact if it is good or not, but OMG my gluten free dinner was delicious! Going into the restaurant I had heard that picazzos was gluten free but I was so impressed with the  waitress' knowledge and understanding of my intolerance. Every single one of the salads was gluten free and many of the pastas and pizzas were as well. I love when restaurants use fresh delicious ingredients and boy, picazzos does not skimp on the good stuff!  We ordered a blue cheese salad (yummy!) and I ordered myself a margarita pizza with gluten free crust- my parents ordered another pepperoni, sausage and ricotta pizza expecting that mine would be less than average. The pizza was delish, not ehh it's gluten free delicious, it was by golly if this pizza was served- without being told it was gluten free- I would be immensely impressed. My parents even enjoyed it! I did not check if they have gluten free deserts because I was so stuffed from the great pizza and salad! 

They also sell gluten free pizza dough for five dollars (and for a gluten free eater it's a steal!) when they are not crowded. Although it's a tad gooey and hard to work with, it makes the most delicious home baked pizza ever, I repeat EVER. I force my mother to buy some whenever she is nearby.

Also on a side note, I am such a iced tea snob and their iced tea was auhhhmazzinggg!! 

Overall a fantastic dinner! I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with their lunch combo! I love having a delicious slice of cheese pizza and a pear gorgonzola salad, yummy! The crust is so delicious. There are also alternative crusts available like the honey wheat or the gluten-free. This location is pretty small, but they do have a patio, that is currently inaccessible due to the remodel, but I did notice heaters outside so when it is available it will be nice to sit at since the weather is cooling down. The price can seem a little much, but they only use organic products so I think its a fair trade.
There is a full bar and the restaurant and bathrooms have always been clean every time I come here. Staff has always been friendly and I've never encountered a problem with food or service here. In fact, if you want a quick, delicious lunch, this is the place to go! Oh and I happened to notice they have a chocolate chip cookie skillet (aka Pizookie aka Pizza Cookie), yep, sold!"}
{"text":"Made a take out order. Showed up and girls at the front were very giggly with each other and not very helpful.. seemed way to young for their job.. I guess the computers were down but instead of telling me what they were doing, they just giggled and ran around the restaurant with my credit card... other than that, the pizza was good.. over priced but good.."}
{"text":"FAIL!     I hope Robert Irvine, of Restaurant Impossible, shows up quickly!   Seriously folks, stay away.   Save yourself the time, money, and frustration.  Just run up to the store and buy a bag of frozen pasta but read the instructions unlike this place.  The other post must have it right, this can not be related to the other Picazzos.   That one is good, just sayin....   Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"This place is so good. And I love the fact that it is organic and gluten free. I'm not a gluten free eater but I know people who can't eat gluten so it makes me happy to know there are places out there for people who can't eat gluten. But I don't mind eating gluten free food. It tastes good. And it's healthy. So I love pasta and Italian so this place was also fun to go to for that reason. I had gnocchi with a Thai sauce. And it was gluten free. I couldn't even taste the difference. It tasted so good though! I think it was the Thai peanut sauce. Very impressed and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Heehee, few things make me happier than good GF pizza! Diagnosed Celiac two years ago, and coming from an Italian family has made the transition difficult. This Picazzo's is great! Atmosphere is cozy, yet elegant. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes just good, depends on the day :). 

I love the garlic and brie appetizer. Salads are always fresh and full of flavor, (Southwestern is a favorite for me and my mama). The pizza is great. Not the best I've had (BJs still wins that contest), but absolutely wonderful non the less! The chocolate chip pizza cookie is insanely good, but definitely one of those things that make you feel guilty for eating.

This restaurant definitely has the most options for GF eaters than any other I've been to, and takes into account cross-contamination, which is HUGE. I would love to give this place 4.5 stars, because it really is awesome, just not my number one :). Hmmm, now I want pizza."}
{"text":"I feel like I'd really be into this place if I had a gluten allergy.

Unfortunately, I love gluten.  It's the best.  So tasty.

I some fig pizza I believe, and it was tasty.  However, for some reason it wasn't so tasty that I could see myself going out of my way to come back here.

Their pizza cookie was not as good as Oregano's."}
{"text":"Best g.f. (gluten free) pizza on earth. hands down. best staff on earth as well. This place is thoughtful in every detail, down to the great hand soap in the bathroom (they even have mouthwash!) Man, I love you, Picazzo's! This location is my favorite. Its not cheap, but with a severe wheat allergy, its worth having a super safe place to eat. I remember what really good regular pizza tastes like (pre-alergy), picazzo's gf or otherwise is way better than just a  really good regular pizza. Feel free to take your non-vegan, non-g.f. friends there, too. They'll love it (just don't get the bread unless you have to eat g.f., but I've never eaten a good g.f. bread...not their fault, wheat makes break work. The g.f. pizza crust, however, is amazing!)"}
{"text":"The food is very good, it is nice to have an environment where a gluten free guest isn't limited to a small section on the menu.

However my GF guest and I chose to sit at the bar at 7pm on a Wednesday expecting a faster paced meal, as opposed to the dining room. We ordered a salad followed by a pizza and twenty minutes after we finished our salad our server/bartender came over to inform us that the cooks forgot about our pizza and it was burnt so they would be remaking it and we would have it out quickly. Another twenty minutes went by and we received our pizza. When we received our final bill there was no discount or any kind of guest recovery offered, which I thought was odd and discourteous, due to the extended waiting time.

My gluten free guest will most likely be back due to lack of better options, but I would not choose to due to the staff's disinterest in my negative dining experience."}
{"text":"I too was excited I found Picazzo's on my GF phone app!! Showed up shortly after they opened and ordered GF pizza slices. The pizza slices were barely warm as if they were sitting in a warmer. We ordered pepperoni/mushroom pizza and the toppings WERE not cooked enough. The side salad, ew! I guess it's too much to ask for a freshly prepared HOT GF organic pizza slice. NOT GOOD for the price!!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Much more casual than I expected.  We got the gluten-free pizza there and it was good. But not to die for. Not very memorable.  

So in my opinion, I would prefer a different pizza place unless I had to eat gluten-free.

Probably won't go back, but glad I tried it once."}
{"text":"This place is a complete rip off.  My lunch salad was $17.34!!  When I tried to order a half size of their wedge salad the lady told me they only offer the Cesar and traditional salad as a side option. Although based on the size of my $17 salad it seems that I got a side.  It was not traditional wedge lettuce so I'm not sure why they couldn't make it into a half size. The two dressing containers took up half my salad container. Who needs that much dressing??"}
{"text":"Severely overpriced.  Marginal service.  Food is fine - not great."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Chandler got there at 8:00 and was told they closed. It was an hour before all posted closing times. I work in a restaurant and can understand if we got there 30 min before closing but an hour is just ridiculous to turn customers away. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and great service! We come here frequently and have never been disappointed. The Diavola pizza is to die for!"}
{"text":"Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen is a gem in the many pizza locations that can be found in the Phoenix area.  Picazzo's boasts a menu which includes appetizers, salads, organic and gluten-free pastas, and of course pizza and dessert!  One cannot go wrong with any of the categories of foods Picazzo's offers, but there are certainly favorites that can be ordered upon ones first visit.  

Picazzo's offers a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere upon entering their establishment.  One is greeted immediately by their hostess at the door and then you are seated promptly at one of their many tables (or the bar area if you prefer).  The atmosphere is roomy with their ample seating, and friendly upon entering.

One of their best appetizers is their Mama's Meat-za Balls ($9.50).  Made with three meatballs with mozzarella, artichoke hearts, organic tomato sauce, basil, and Parmesan, it is a savory appetizer that easy starts the meal off on the right foot. 

One can choose from one of their many pasta dishes or their pizza creations, or even create your own creation.  If going with one of their creations, I would recommend their \"Nonna's Favorite\" (gluten free) ($16.50, $21.00, $25.00).  This pizza is a delicious combination of organic olive oil and garlic, Fontina and mozzarella cheeses, mushrooms, tomatoes, goat cheese, Kalamata olives, and basil. Melts right in your mouth and one can easy eat more than one expected! 

If even after all of this you still crave something sweet - One cannot go wrong with electing their \"Classic Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie\" ($7.00).  This sinful combination includes two scoops of organic vanilla bean or coconut vanilla ice cream served with your choice of organic chocolate, chocolate mint, or chocolate raspberry sauce over a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie.  Oh wondrous dessert indeed!

Picazzo's will leave you most satisfied and delighted with all that is good.  With the finest ingredients, Picazzo's takes great care in delivering the best in atmosphere and dish.  Stop by Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen today for an unforgettable meal."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Wonderful salads. Friendly and efficient staff. Lots of other menu options too. Good for take out too. 
One of the best kale salads I have ever had."}
{"text":"For a healthy and raw place that are so few around here I just wish there were more menu choices! Service is always good although was quite noisey the few times we were there!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed dining out here.  We're on vacation, with 3 kids ages 4, 9, and 11.  The kids menu was one of the best in town - lots of good choices for picky kiddos.  The service was great.  Lots of yummy soup, salad and pizza choices.  My husband and I split the healthy gourmet salad and fig and Gorgonzola pizza - both excellent. The tiramisu was awesome.  Would definitely recommend eating here, especially families with young kids."}
{"text":"A solid work day lunch menu and price point.  Think of it as a place to go when you want something better then those NY slice places but don't want to commit to a larger price and pizza that comes with some of the better Neapolitan inspired places in town."}
{"text":"We love this place. There's something for everyone. One of the best gluten friendly restaurants in Arizona. Love their pizzas and desserts! We're regulars here and we don't plan on changing :)"}
{"text":"I like the fresh organic menu. The happy hour half off menu is a smokin deal and full of tasty apps. The service is particularly friendly and attentive. Overall, one of the few quality vegan restaurants around."}
{"text":"Had Picazzos on my lunch break. Never again. Good but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. The soup and salad combo is the size of a kids meal. I could literally count the number of romaine leaves in my salad. I would guess that the soup is about one ladle scoop size of a bowl. 

I was starving after eating 15 leaves of romaine. Do NOT eat here if you're HUNGRY. 

Not worth all of the money they charge... at all."}
{"text":"I love Picazzo's for a few key items that I can't get anywhere else.  For a dinner, they have an amazing Chopped Italian salad that you can substitute kale for free (and make sure you do it!).  Actually, kale can be substituted for free on any of their salads so you really can't go wrong, but this one is by far my favorite.  Also, if you're in the mood for something small (or an appetizer prior to your meal), their cranberry jalapeno hummus is amazing!  Go there for happy hour to get 50% off any of the appetizers (and this one is well worth it!).  The service is always great as well, and they're always offering fun monthly specials.  I'd give them a 5 stars, but I've tried three different pizzas, and wasn't impressed with any of them, so if you stick with the salad, you'll never go wrong!"}
{"text":"Being 100% Italiano and all I just had to try out this establishment because it can be quite challenging to make high quality Italian food in an organic/healthy manner ...

The menu is quite extensive ... They offer a lot of different things, so there are plenty of options for just about anyone ...

Each time I've eaten here I've done more of a tapas style eating experience... ordering a vast amount of small plates and sharing.  The sad truth is that nothing that I have ever tried/eaten here stands out in my mind.  

It's all just \"okay\" and some stuff \"not so great\" ... I definitely didn't care for their pizza at all....

The big reason why I don't come here very often has to do with the high price points.  If you like to eat, which most Italians do ... It is nearly impossible to walk out of here without spending close to $80 for only two people, and I am sorry to say, but that is just far too costly for mediocre food.

The service here is also so-so ... And if you go on a busy night FORGETABOUT IT!! It will take you at least two hours to get out of this place ...

Overall, I don't have anything absolutely horrible to say about this restaurant, but I also can't think of anything good to say about it.  It's essentially a wash, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  It's clean, nice atmosphere, cool vibe, yet average tasting over priced food.  I have to give them credit for making an attempt to making typical unhealthy Italian food into healthy organic cuisine ... You absolutely have to give them an A for effort because I don't think I've ever seen another Italian restaurant offer healthy/organic options????

I can't exactly recommend it, but I can't say to stay away from it because who knows maybe you will love it?  So my best advice would be to try it out if your up for the challenge and don't mind paying :)"}
{"text":"Great concept, they still have a ways to go on the taste though, both our main entrees were pretty bland. I loved sitting on the patio it was cool but they had the warmers on & it was nice.  It also took an unusually long time to get our food and when we got the appetizer ( bruschetta ) it was burned! I'd really like to see this place do well."}
{"text":"The work of Picasso and Picazzo's have some things in common.  They're both beautiful, and they're both very EXPENSIVE.  (For a mere $26, you can own a large Margherita pizza.)

In an attempt to mix it up, we went with a medium Nonna's favorite ($17) and a large farmhouse salad ($15).  The pizza was good, but not outstanding.  Despite trying to avoid the Margherita, the fresh basil and tomatoes were the dominant flavor on this sauceless pizza.  The cheese was generously applied on a thin, chewy crust that was fine, but lacked the crispness I like on the bottom of my pizza.

The salad was more the star of the meal.  It was a very interesting mix of crunchy fresh vegetables (kale, cabbage, lettuce), roasted vegetables (brussel sprouts, cauliflower carrots), along with some dried cranberries and pumpkins seeds for more texture.  The chevre cheese in the salad was LEGIT, providing my favorite bites of the meal by far.  I hate an overdressed salad, but they went the other direction with this one.  It was underdressed to the point of almost non-existent dressing flavor, and the red cabbage dominated the overall flavor of the salad.

The happy hour was decent, and it's a family restaurant ambience.  I just can't get over the price.  We could see the TVs in the bar playing $5.99 Domino's commercials as we ate our $50 meal.  I'm more likely to buy a Warhol poster than another Picazzo."}
{"text":"Amazing! Finally someone knows about gluten allergies and celiac!! If you want to go somewhere safe this is the place to go!!! I had an amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"Awesome healthy options for those wanting gluten free and organic dishes.  Try the pizza and salads, you can't go wrong.  
The staff are always kind and helpful.   They really shine on service."}
{"text":"As you walk in the door youll see the nice interior and the great full bar they had, thats basically it.

The food is alright but actually pretty good for gluten free and vegan. The girl at the front desk was a bit awkward and bothered me when i was on the phone

The food is hella priced for the small portion you get.

But i will be coming back because no doubt really good for a vegan/gf restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was really good and catered to my mother in law who has a severe gluten allergy. It took us over 2 hours to get our food and get seated. People were leaving because the wait for food was so long. I think the food is excellent here, but their process and efficiency needs some help."}
{"text":"This is a good place for salads.  I eat here probably 4 out of 5 times a week, and always order the heart healthy gourmet salad with chicken added.  It's pretty perfect.  I wouldn't order the full salad - just do half, as the proportions of lettuce to the \"good stuff\" (avocados, walnuts, apples, etc.) gets unbalanced and then there is just too much lettuce.  And nobody wants to be munching on just lettuce all day . . ."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh, and service is always friendly.  I have only ever ordered salads here so I can't really speak to their gluten-free menu items, but there are usually lots of people eating here.  This place is part of my weekly lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Ugh, I always feel terrible writing a bad review, but sometimes it can't be helped...  The upshot is that the food was bland and dry, and the prices for pizza were super steep.  The food did look nice. Our experience: terrible, expensive food.

I heard good things about this place years ago, so we decided to meet friends there.  We arrived for Happy Hour, so the appetizers were half price and drinks were $1 off.  

My \"Bruschetta\" was a rather dry flatbread, with a bland crust (maybe not bad for gluten free?), and toppings that weren't evenly spread out, so you got clumps of a lot on some pieces and not much on others.  

The Brie was nice - a large portion with roasted garlic, fruit and sub-par bread.

The real problem came with the pizzas, which were incredibly overpriced for the size, even if they had been tasty.  My husband's pizza (\"super healthy wheat crust\", dates, red pears) was the smallest medium I've seen, and my small was truly a one-person pizza (mushrooms and vine-ripened tomatoes). With two toppings each (and free arugula), we managed to pay nearly $40 for a small and medium create-your-own!  

The worst part was that the pizzas tasted incredibly bland.  I frequently order very healthy food- that's no excuse for flavorless results.  The organic tomato sauce was wet (but otherwise tasteless), making for a soggy pizza.  The fresh mozzarella didn't have the wonderfull taste and consistency that the name implies.  Even my mushroom and tomato toppings lacked flavor - how is that even accomplished? 

The place was ok-looking and had nice service (aside from the male host who used the ladies restroom and left it dirty).  

Our friends seemed to like their Caprese salad, Mushroom cap and Squash Ravioli with Pesto, so maybe our mistake was ordering anything with a crust.  I won't be going back to find out!"}
{"text":"First time customer.   Visited with a big group and lots of people during the lunch rush.  Place was packed.   Service was good, but I could tell they didn't staff up for this level of people.  

I ordered the Zo's Chopped Salad.  Looked great!   I got it standard with chicken.  Pretty good.  Not mind-blowing, but a filling salad with a lot of good flavors."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.

Chopped salad was a above average (really liked the macadamia nuts) but pricy.
Wings were boring and pricy.
Service was timely and helpful.
Setting was generic but pleasant."}
{"text":"I came here with my good pal who has a gluten allergy and spoke highly of the food. The exterior threw me a bit as it looked a little cheesy (no pun) and generic.  I found the dining room ambiance drab and in need of a face lift. However, just 10 feet away lies a lovely and warm patio equipped with a fire pit and several tables. 

Pasta had my eye on this night, with which there was an array of diverse options. All the pasta's we ordered were magnificent. I will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes. The weight staff was very friendly and prompt as well. Kudos Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"5 and 5 and 5 and again 5

I am celiac, so please let me tell you how painful it is to get a pizza or pasta or anything Italian.
At Picazzo you get everything you want.
I got the Alfredo seafood pizza and it was just delicious.

My poor BF got a pasta dish which was very light taste wise and was disappointed.

But we shared a beautiful apple turnover which was amazing.

Will go back for sure !!!! Just wish they were expending to Canada now....."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love

My BF and I went on vacation to Phoenix,( and we are going back - we love it), and I was thinking, in US it will be hard to get Gluten Free food.
Man, I was wrong !!
We were told about Picazzo, and went there not expecting much.
We had the meat ball starter for 2, huge portion with Gluten Free bread - Delicious, fresh and very tasty
Then I got a pizza - Italian style with fine crust and plenty of topping on it, fantastic
And the best of all, Gluten Free Chocolate Brownie with Coconut milk Ice Cream - Divine

The place looked great, the staff friendly and the bill had a good price.

Will go back !!!!"}
{"text":"I love wings, and I especially like them crispy so the skin is worth eating. Their wings...not so crispy and too fatty. Good flavor, but fatty.

Hummus is one of my favorites, but their hummus had so much garlic in it that I'm still breathing garlic fire this morning after brushing twice and using a ton of mouthwash. Beware, it's one of those \"oh, but you taste so good. oh, but I know I shouldn't.\" And you do it anyway.

Their pizza is good. We had the shrimp and bacon, and the pepperoni, sausage and peppers pizzas. They ran out of bacon, which was a bummer because you could tell something was missing. And who runs out of bacon when it's on quite a few of their specialty pizzas? The other pizza was good, all of the peppers and onions made it sweeter and I wish the sausage and pepperoni would have added some spicy/saltiness to the pizza to balance that out. Great crust. Super tasty, slightly crispy, slightly chewy.

Happy hour is great, so I can't complain about how cheap it was last night."}
{"text":"First time visit. Arrived late on a Friday night for a light bite to eat. Hubby and I sat at the bar and was served by Christine, who was very friendly and provided us with great service.
We split the Italian White Bean Kale Soup and the Broken Wedge salad. Both were amazing!
The food came out very fast. Can not wait to go back and try the pizza and pasta dishes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, but a bit chilly. The server seemed a bit rushed at first, even though it wasn't very busy, but he was very nice and helpful. The food was AMAZING! I had the veggie pasta and substituted the red sauce for alfredo sauce and had the heart healthy salad. Both were delicious! The pasta and all the veggies were cooked to perfection. My only complaint is that the toast is tasteless. I'm assuming it was gluten free and that's why it was a little different than I'm used to, but I think they could have added garlic to it or something. I indulged on dessert and had the cheesecake brownie with salted caramel sauce and it was sooooo good! The prices aren't bad and are comparable to other Italian restaurants but with much better food quality and taste. Overall I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food isn't as good as it use to be and neither is the service. I go there since they have a gluten-free menu, but I have been disappointed the last few times I went there. The bartender has no personality whatsoever. She only seems to be nice to the people she knows."}
{"text":"Oh, Seriously!  This lunch I had today was OVER THE TOP!  
Husband and I went here for lunch.  It started to feel a bit long of a wait, and I started to get hangry.  I told husband we won't be back here...

Well....then my LUNCH arrived!  I had their combo of pasta and salad.  The Zo's Chopped Salad and a Thai Peanut Fusilli something.

The MOMENT I saw it, I heard angels singing.  The presentation was beautiful, and the food was even BETTER!

Our server, Holly (who was very nice...has been there for 12 years!), explained that there had been a huge to go order ... I said \"Stop!  All is forgotten.\"...  This was hands down a wonderful, fresh, tasty, perfect lunch.

Go here.  It's better than I could have expected."}
{"text":"I LOVE Picazzo's!

Everything I've gotten here is really great and they have TONS of options for people avoiding gluten, dairy, and even soy!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Picazzos and the owners. I have a very extensive amount of food allergies, and eating out at any restaurant is a daunting task. Before I went to Picazzo's for the first time, I hadn't had pizza in more than 8 years, as there was no one that made a safe one for me. Unlike other restaurants I have been to, their gluten free/ allergy free food tastes delicious and you will not want to stop eating it. The brothers who run the restaurants are so sweet and accommodating, they make sure that people with multiple food allergies and sensitives will all have something to eat."}
{"text":"I give them 3 stars due to a combined 4 star and 1 star experience. The first time I came here a couple years ago, the food was really good, and the service was excellent. A little pricey, but nice, as it's healthier food. The second experience? Not so great. I was making lasagna one night, and had forgotten to buy garlic bread. I thought, no problem, I will just call ahead and order some to go. When I arrived at the promised time, not only was my order not ready, the order hadn't been put in! Kind of defeats the purpose of calling ahead for it to be ready. I didn't get the impression that anyone cared about the mistake. I was asked to pay and have a seat. I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. Almost 20 more minutes went by before it was finally ready, with no apology or concern, or even a discount maybe for my trouble. The garlic bread was very expensive, and the worst I've ever had. I would have been better off to put some butter and garlic salt on some bread and put it in the oven. It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Crust was perfect! We got delivery so I can't speak for the restaurant itself. But delivery was timely and pizza was hot and delicious! We got the Chicken bacon and herb. Yum!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we had been here but we saw a groupon and decided it was time to get back in. The food was great, as always, but the menu has changed. The new menu offers new quinoa bowls that I would like to try, but didn't try this time. This time we enjoyed a create your own pizza and had vegan alfredo, light daiya cheese, beyond meat chicken, spinach and mushrooms as toppings. It was amazing! We also enjoyed the vegan curry broccoli crowns as an appetizer. The portion size on those seems to have gotten smaller and I'm pretty sure the price has gone up. I also think the price went up on our favorite salad, the Heart Healthy. We get this salad every time we come and with no meat and no cheese I really don't understand why they need to charge $15+ for it. We're disappointed the prices have gone up, but with a groupon it was worthwhile. The new menu is expanded with more vegan options for us, so that is definitely appealing as well. Our server was Brian W. and he was attentive, knowledgeable, and patient. Great service even though it was a busy Saturday night and we could tell the table next to us was a pain to deal with. We will go back, but will look for lunch specials, happy hour and groupons since they are getting a little too expensive for our pocketbooks."}
{"text":"This is super yummy and fresh. Price was a bit high for lunch. Nice place with inside and outside seating. Separate bar area."}
{"text":"My father has Celiac Disease. We went to Picasso's for dinner and he loved it! He felt as though he were in food heaven as there were so many items to choose from! We were all pleased with our food and service!"}
{"text":"My sister and I go here every single time we come to Phoenix.  The gluten free crusts are fantastic and the waiters are cute.  The appetizers are top notch and the wait staff is helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved trying their new vegan menu. I used to go here a bunch as a kid and loved it back then but now I found a new love for it due to the fact that they had a full vegan menu. My friend and I had the vegan Naples Margherita pizza and also the vegan hummus plate. Both were amazing and you really couldn't even tell the pizza crust was gluten free also, it was delicious! Highly recommend this to anyone, and they have killer happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Long wait but their food is not worth the wait.  You can get a much better quality pizza at Domino's.  This place isn't one of my favorite pizza places.  Their pizza needs improvement and so does their service."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!!!! Great variety of option on the menu. Huge selection of foods. Had the eggplant  Parmesan which was excellent. Wine was amazing. Sat on the patio very nice quaint place. Waitress was very helpful."}
{"text":"Don't let the 3 stars turn you away, especially if you're strictly gluten-free. Four or five star restaurants have to WOW me on more than just choices; it has to wow me on flavor and creativity. For menu choices only I would definitely give this place 4 or even 5, but the flavor just wasn't there. I need at least one bite that makes me close my eyes and have a When Harry Met Sally cafe scene moment. That didn't happen. The flavor was just \"every day\" for me. I could make something equally as tasty at home. 

A 3-person dinner with appetizers and dessert ran us over $100 (with a 20% tip) - far too pricey for an \"every day\" sort of restaurant. I know making gluten-free/healthier foods costs more, but I still think the pricing is a bit much. 

All that said, it's nice to have a gluten-free place to go when we're feeling lazy and don't want to cook/clean up at home."}
{"text":"Ordered artichoke dip, waited 1 hour and it didn't arrive so I left. The waitress didn't even come by to apologize."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. 
It's a little slice of heaven.

{"text":"Picazzo's offers amazing vegan options. They have an entire vegan menu and everything I've tried from the vegan Bianca to the vegan bbq chick'n pizza has been amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the chopped Italian salad! So yummy and fresh! I loved it! I can't wait to go back and try a pasta dish (i'm gluten free) Friendly service and clean! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"our first visit. we've heard good things about picazzo's due to their \"healthy\" and flair for organic food. 

service was fast and very good. happy hour offers half off appetizers and 1 dollar off drinks. i had a stuffed portabello mushroom cap. it was full of flavor and had a nice texture, not overcooked. my entree was the butternut squash ravioli with sundried tomatoes. i was impressed. full of flavor and spot on with the acidity and saltiness. my wife had the caprese salad and was quite happy with her choice. 

our dining friends weren't as impressed with their pizza's and flatbreads. they did order a baked brie which on a small sample tasted, was very good."}
{"text":"I have visited this location of Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen on several occasions.  While I used to enjoy certain appetizers (such as the Italian chicken wings), all dishes are not organic (and gluten free).  The food has always been rather good, and the lunch specials are great!  My friend and I both got the lunch specials today.  For a low price, you get an entree (pasta or slice of pizza), a salad, and a drink.  

A few other perks include happy hour discounts and the rewards program (spend so much and then get money off the next purchase).  There are rarely waits at Picazzo's, and the service has always been good.  They also serve dessert and have a full bar."}
{"text":"Tried Picazzo's recently and the food was disappointing. We got the pasta and it was so dry with little flavor. The prices are so high for the quality and portion size. Definately won't be ordering it again"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because I loved the Surprise location and dined there many times before it closed. The Glendale location opened with little fanfare and on my first visit I was very pleased with the nearby location, cheery decor and menu items offering healthy, nutritious meals at fair prices. On our first visit, our server was super friendly and eager to please. We ordered Pizza and salads and our drink order was served immediately. Our food took about 45 minutes to arrive. Had we known it would take so long, I would have ordered an appetizer. Everything was delicious and we left fairly happy, hoping to return soon. Several weeks later, we returned with friends and ordered Pizza and salads once again. As during our previous visit, our food took almost an hour to arrive and as we were all very hungry, we complained and were told they were \"busier than usual\" that night. Even though I vowed I wouldn't go back, we returned last night with some out of town friends, hoping things would be better. Once we were seated, our charming server took our drink and food orders. From the time our drinks were served, it once again took about one hour for our food to arrive. As on previous visits, everything was hot and perfectly prepared, but it shouldn't take an hour to be served. Obviously the kitchen has problems that should have been fixed by now. It's too bad, because the wait staff, quality of food and menu selections have been outstanding. This place has tons of potential, but until they fix the problem with the kitchen, I won't return."}
{"text":"Is this the best pizza I have ever had,,, no.  Is it the best organic / gluten free pizza,,, YES!  If this place was in LA, there would be a line around the block.  Luckly, this is not the case & there is rarely a wait.  A rare find in AZ and worth every penny.  Oh yeah, snag a coupon on restaurant.com for killer savings!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I love all the gluten-free, dairy-free and vegan options, and that these are included at no additional charge, like most places do. Everything I've had here has been delicious! The service is usually very friendly as well. And on my birthday, they gave me a free Pizookie! The only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars is they are extremely expensive! The happy hour is a good deal, but the regular menu is pricey..."}
{"text":"2 stars in Yelp lingo means \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and I have. I ordered the caprese salad and it was served with foccacia. While a generous portion of bread, the tomato and mozzarella rounds were the size of roma slices. It was dull. 

There were some interesting cocktails but my bitters and soda (which is club soda with a shake of aromatic bitters in it - helpful for upset stomachs) came in a smaller glass and I got charged for refills. I've never been charged for refills on bitters and soda before anywhere else. Frankly, that irritated me. Quite a bit. 

I could have had a mojito for what my 3 club sodas cost. 

And, I don't have a problem with gluten or a compulsion to eat organically so I'm not desperate enough to let those demands compensate."}
{"text":"They offer gluten free and vegan pizza's as well as regular unhealthy versions. all taste pretty good and have a good selection of other entrees as well."}
{"text":"One of the best options for a gluten-free restaurant in the valley.  The lunch special is an especially good deal and satisfying meal!  The puttanesca pizza is always a good decision.  Fun environment and friendly staff!  And the desserts are good too!"}
{"text":"Great food (gluten free), great service, and you can't have a better drink made anywhere. Parking can be a little tricky at busy times."}
{"text":"The decor was nice and the service was fine. Ate here for the first time tonight, as our regular organic place closed down. I had the cheese ravioli (gluten free) with white sauce, spinach, peas...whatever that dish was called. I was nauseous within 30 minutes of finishing my meal and 5 hours later I have been suffering from my first case of food poisoning all evening. Cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, you name it. Thankfully my husband did not eat and my 14 month old refused bites of my meal. She must have known...needless to say we will never be going back. Not the first impression you want to take from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's see Chipotle Chicken....onions....yellow peppers.....cheese....cheese... and more cheese....NO TOMATO SAUCE ....which was great....jalapenos on top.....and all of that sitting on a Bagel Crust with garlic and butter. Yeah I know your hungry now......not to mention it is all organic as well. Now the bad news is that for 23 bucks for a large....it is not very large....but it is filling.....so if your looking for great tasting pizza....salad....pasta....and desert....and remember it's mostly organic.....then go to Picazzo's. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was funky.  We went last week, with two gift certificates from Sunflower Markets.  When our server finally came with extra sighs and huffs of over-work blithering. Before greating us looked at the gift certificates sitting on the table and said 'you can't use those both here'--it's the rules of the owners.  So I asked are we allowed to split checks at a table--'no'.  We can't really comment on the food...the staffer was so rude about it, that we actually walked out.

(We have tried the location at PV Mall...we had a great experience with the atmosphere and server...food was okay: salad-good, GF pizza-below average.)"}
{"text":"As someone not sensitive to gluten and an omnivore, the dinner I had here last night was very disappointing.  My wife was thrilled to see the fig gorgonzola pizza so we ordered a small one with a regular crust and the turkey meatballs as an appetizer so there'd be at least a little protein.
The meatballs were decent enough and the tomato sauce was too, but they described it as spicy on the menu.  It is not.  
The order came with \"foccacia\" to sop up the sauce.  But it turns out that they give you a corner of gluten free bread instead which of course instantly dissolves the second it hits sauce.  I tried a piece without sauce; it's basically off tasting cornbread.  Glad I don't HAVE to eat that.
Turns out the meatballs would be the highlight of the night.  The pizza had no detectable gorgonzola and the \"balsamic vinegar\" was actually a sickeningly sweet balsamic glaze which just piled sweet upon sweet figs.  The crust had the consistency of Olive Garden breadsticks.
While $17 might be in the ballpark for the gluten free version, this wasn't worth anything near that.  At $28, the 16\" version of this pie is highway robbery.
I suspect that if you are one of the very few that actually have Celiac's (like my sister who loves this place), this place is paradise.  For the rest of us, there are so many better options like Dozo next door."}
{"text":"As a person with gluten and dairy sensitivities, I can find so many options here!! There aren't many places that offer zucchini noodle pasta options, but Picazzo's does! SO GOOD. They also have a gluten free dairy free brownie and coconut ice cream....which is my favorite!! ....I'm guilty of coming here just for dessert....."}
{"text":"First off, we have Celiac in the family so GLUTEN FREE is super important to us! We have given up on many restaurants and have found that we end up being the best educators as to this underdiagnosed condition. That being said...It's nice to go somewhere where the whole menu is available to my Celiac son.
On our visit, I had the shrimp scampi which was perfectly delicious although could have used more shrimp for my seafood loving self. Both of my kids had the kids spaghetti with no meatball and enjoyed it. All gluten-free, I might add. For kids, they have coloring sheets, crayons and kids meals. Really, what more can u ask for? BTW, their chocolate milk is really good, but big. Go there, if u dare.
I recommend for GF or Celiacs. Haven't had any issues so far. Service was a little slow, but I could hear they were training new servers. Not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Uhh, the whole restaurant is \"reserved\" except the cold patio on a Friday night.   What?!!  No thanks!  Not coming back here.  Crappy parking lot too.  Not a smart move management."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times over the years and had felt pretty neutral about the place up until my last visit. I love all the gluten free/ vegan and vegetarian friendly options that they now have! 
During past visits I had ordered pasta or pizza dishes, and I enjoyed them. My last trip we got cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer. The bread is super dense, but still very good. For my main dish I got Eggplant Parmesan, and it was absolutely delicious. I love Eggplant Parmesan, and this dish exceeded my expectations. Sometimes Eggplant Parmesan ends up kind of mushy and weird, but this one was excellent. Also totally gluten free! I also had vegetables as a side to share and I was impressed with the variety of vegetables used. For dessert I shared a gluten free chocolate chip cookie with coconut ice cream on top and I gobbled it right up. I can't even remember the last time I ate so much in one sitting. But it was all just so darn good!
Our server seemed quite awkward and uncomfortable, but he did a fine job! The atmosphere in this restaurant is nice too, a good place to go for a tasty dinner, or just an appetizer and drink. This place is pretty darn expensive, though worth it. I was an infrequent visitor before, but this last visit has definitely made me want to come back more!"}
{"text":"Excellent lasagna!  The wait staff know my mother-in-law by name because she goes there often for their organic salads.  Great service, outdoor seating available & ample parking near by."}
{"text":"My husband twin daughters and I went in here about a month or so ago. This was my husbands second time as he works right next to the restaurant. I am an extremely picky eater and tend to repeat restaurants that I know will leave my tummy very happy :) which is like four restaurants well now I have five. I ordered their spinach salad with some modifications that they obliged. Their balsamic dressing is on the thick side but such a yummy taste. We ordered the garlic cheese bread it was good but small portion. And then a regular pizza. I was full from my salad which is hugeee so I barely had room for pizza but my hubby and daughters loved it! Great atmosphere for family or a date night. The bar area seemed quiet and chill."}
{"text":"Really like this place. I have always wanted to visit and I am glad I choose this place for dinner tonight. We got the wheat crust pizza and chopped salad. We were able to share these items. I really like the freshness of the salad and the abundance of topping on our pizza. I will definitely be back especially for the chopped salad."}
{"text":"It wasn't too bad but didn't blow my socks off.  Better than \"meh\" status but not by much.  Staff is great.  they bump it up from 2 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite restaurants. No matter what you order you know it's going to be healthy. Food was great. The service and atmosphere was wonderful. I'm looking forward to the next time I dine in here."}
{"text":"Im giving it only 2 stars because of the price of magerita and the tiny cup it came it.

I order the truffel pizza it was good but over priced for the size.

If you dont mid over priced under sized food come give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Mmmm Organic food ... wait what!?  Yeah I can't say I know the difference in taste.  I guess my palate is not as popping as I say it is -- or maybe there's real no difference!  I can appreciate the idea.  However, the organic part just sounds better and sophisticated.  I eat organic only a-har a-har a-har.  Picazzo's Organic Kitchen is a great selling tool.  Though I can't bash their pizza, it's actually pretty good.  I love their crust is that \"organic\"?  Gotta get their bacon bleu cheese wedge salad -- it's a must.  Organic Bacon?  Ambience makes you feel smarter too -- or maybe I'm that already :)  Service was great, my server recommended a small since it's actually a large :)  Do \"organic\" food appear more hmmm... - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! From the amazing hospitality to the delicious food options, you won't be more satisfied dining anywhere other than Picazzos. It's hard finding a place that accommodates for food allergens and I've never had any cross contamination at this establishment. We've dined at all AZ locations and the consistency is something we can always count on. We've tried several dishes including pizzas, pasta, salad, appetizers, drinks and desserts. I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here. The prices are so reasonable and the quality of the food keeps us coming back. Kyla makes the best drinks in house, Cara is one of the best servers always remembering our orders and greeting is with a friendly smile. If I could rate picazzos a 10/5 I would because they are that amazing!"}
{"text":"Still a good lunch spot, just had to comment on the salad I had, the one with pears, glazed walnuts and raspberry vinaigrette!  YUMMY!  I will be back for that one for sure."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in my lunch today. I ordered online on the Take Out link on Picazzo's website. it told me my order would be ready in 20 minutes. Cool. I waited then went to pick up my lunch. They didn't have it made because they never got my order. The girl said it happens all of the time. :( I waited another 20 minutes for them to make my quinoa bowl. I get back to work and am eating my bowl when I realize they didn't put any chicken on it. I double checked the menu and all of their bowls come with chicken. 

To say the least, to pay $11 for the bowl and I gave the girl a $2 tip because she was so nice to me, that's the most expensive salad with the least satisfaction I have ever had."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for leisurely lunch to meet up with friends, we all enjoyed good lunch here.

I've been to their Sedona location and they are my regular night before the race eatery, I was excited about trying this Scottsdale location. 

Their lunch special is really a great deal, served with a choice of salad, just right portion size for lunch. I tried their lasagna, it wasn't the best but still good. I had much more flavorful pasta dish at dinner time from their Sedona location, not sure why but what I had for lunch didn't have that great flavor I was hoping.

Don't forget to check in on Yelp for free desert, tiramisu. Pretty good size, we ordered two deserts and shared by four people, felt like it was just right amount to share.

Patio seat was perfect on a Sunny afternoon, nicely shaded, when it wasn't that hot outside, pleasant to dine outside."}
{"text":"Had Pizza here last night after a long day at work, we saw the location in Sedona and then I remembered the one near our home in Phoenix.  We ordered the Chipotle Chicken  with the garlic and butter bagel crust and I got a small single Caesar salad. We were very hungry and when my salad was served I was grateful. As far as Caesar salads go this one was just OK, The pizza was very good and the crust lived up to it's name nice as a must try. My only complaint is that a large would be compared to a medium at Pizza Hut or Domino's for $24 keep that in mind if you just want some pizza. But if you want organic toppings, whole wheat crust, or gluten free crust then this is your place."}
{"text":"even though we live in Buckeye, occasionally we are in the east valley & when we are, we always eat here. Love, love this place. Hubby & I are both GF & where we live, there is nothing like Picazzo's. We always have a delicious salad and then their GF tiramisu!! We have yet to try their GF pizza, but certainly can't wait. Wish they would build a Picazzo's in Goodyear or close by. PLEASE????"}
{"text":"I went to a networking lunch here this week and I was pretty impressed. It was a little confusing looking at the menu if we had to order a lunch combo or not. I ended up getting a slice of sausage pizza with a green salad. I appreciated that the server asked if we had any allergies that they should be aware of. 

The food was pretty good. The salads were fresh, though my friend said his had too much dressing. My other friend had the spinach manicotti and it looked delicious and she devoured all of it. I thought the pizza was as good as any place. The crust was chewy and delicious. Our group was really big and everyone was on separate checks. I was impressed by how well our server kept everyone's order and bill sorted. 

The main downside was how loud it was. We could barely hear what was being said more than 2 people away. This is a good place for a small group, but anything bigger than 4 or 6 is too hard."}
{"text":"Have been here several times before and had good experiences but this time was different. Recent menu changes are severely disappointing and the staff was underwhelming. They have eliminated several pizza crust types and now offer thin crust only. The roasted garlic topping was whole cloves in the past and is now minced, it also appeared as fresh garlic on the bill. The caramelized onions were barely cooked. The pizza was also doughy in the middle but burned on the edges. The waiter was very inattentive and didn't give us any updates while we waited 30 minutes for our pizza. He also had someone else bring us our check when we asked about the unexplained change in garlic. Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Food and atmosphere is great...especially when it's cooler outside and you can eat on the patio.  I love that they serve healthy, organic food.  Their lunch specials are very reasonable, but dinner can quickly get costly.  The downside is the service can be slow and sometimes it feels like they are understaffed. However, even with the shortcomings the quality and taste of food is great."}
{"text":"Just amazing! Everything about this place is great. I love vegan, vegetarian and gluten free places to eat. It brings more variety. I am vegetarian but I absolutely love vegan food and this place is exactly what I needed. Super helpful, fun and nice staff, AMAZING food and pretty set, reasonable prices. The inside is very nice and clean as well. And for those who still love meat, they do have those options for pizza toppings or other foods. Overall, I love this place and will come here for a very long time."}
{"text":"Hard not to like what Picazzo's brings to the table: a very fresh, organic, local-grown, healthy version of eating....AND it's delicious! For every picky eater out there following a diet, you'll be amazed at how this menu accommodates those strange dietary requirements of yours. 

And a nice little draft beer selection (wine, full bar, TV's....), bravO Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Picazzos and I WILL return!  My friend had ordered a custom pizza with olive oil and garlic, artichoke hearts, pepperoncini with mozarella and kalamata olives.  The crust was cooked all the way, nice and crispy.  Our server was very attentive and pleasant.  Fairly quiet for lunch on the day before Thanksgiving and the price for both of us was reasonable."}
{"text":"We love Picazzos pizza. Our favorite is the sausage and ricotta cheese. Their salads are AHmazing too. We used to get the pear Gorgonzola salad and also like the strawberry fields salad. Service is great here and they have GF options too."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic but it was so over priced!!!! I am not a fan of paying $15.95 for a small pep pizza that (barely) feeds 1 hungry person. The caesar salad was a large and again, really wasnt too filling and was 12 bucks. 

***Attention owners- I get that you serve good gourmet pizza, but holy smokes- lower your prices!"}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i love this location and the one in Sedona AZ. Great service , Food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and their lunch special was perfect for a man on the go. I went in, sat at the bar, and (I believe her name was Jenny) Jenny was an awesome server. She gave me my choice of any salad on the menu and a slice of heaven, I mean pizza. She even explained what it meant to be gluten free. Not that it matters to me personally, but it's intersting to know and helpful to many I'm sure. 

Thanks guys for the great service, awesome salad(super bomb crutons that I've been dying for), and the little bit of heaven in a pepperoni covered slice of picazzo!!"}
{"text":"This location used to be a Picazzo's and was excellent.  It shut down, opened as Buon Gusto for awhile, then that closed.  I was so excited to see that Picazzo's was going to re-open in this location.  What a LETDOWN!  They were over priced for my two pizzas and it did not taste very good.  The pizza was tasteless and reminded me of a bad frozen pizza.  I was totally disappointed and will not be visiting again.  They can't possible be associated with the original restaurant because they can't even compare."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Unique, prepared healthy food.  Would definitely go back there again. Lots of variety on the menu, including Thai and Asian themed food. Some items are a bit pricey, but you are paying for organic food. The service was attentive and our waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not much one for gluten-free or organic food, but I was in the mood for Italian and I stumbled across Picazzo's. Took a seat at the bar and ordered half a wedge salad and the spicy Thai peanut chicken pasta. Service was somewhat slow, but the beer was cold and that helped. The salad came, and it was enormous! Enough for two. The pasta was excellent. Just enough heat and really tasty."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. The food was really good. My fiance and I ordered organic soda(Yum!), had a pizza with regular thick crust and the baked wings which were really great! I am excited to try more menu options. We happened to come around closing on a Thursday night, and the service was just horrible. Being a server in my past, I know people have off nights, so I will let this one slide. I plan to go back, the menu now that is organic and fresh just seems great! I am excited more restaurants in town are going in the organic, fresh direction."}
{"text":"Love this place! they completely redid the menu since the last time I was here and it was awesome! They have more vegan options! the lentil soup and kale salad were delicious! I have been here before and will be back :)"}
{"text":"Service with Sharissa at the bar was amazing! Food was amazing! Sangria was amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a frequent guest of area restaurants, Picazzo's stands out as one of our favorites.  This location has amazing gluten free dishes and lots of delicious salads.  We love the large patio in summer(misters) and winter(heaters)!  But what sets this location and restaurant apart from the others is the staff.  From the hostess who always greets you with a smile, to the servers who are not only friendly,but knowledgeable and always go the extra mile (even for picky eaters)  This location is so smoothly run by the most hard working manager around, Stephen Tarrantino.  He always makes you feel like you are part of the Picazzo family, and isn't above refilling drinks or taking orders when its busy.  The warm atmosphere he creates brings us back weekly. Great restaurant for families, date night or even dining alone!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Food was delicious. Fresh ingredients 
Service is excellent.My Mother In Law eats gluten free. She love the pizza"}
{"text":"Best food in west valley! The spicy peanut Thai quinoa bowl and the peanut Thai (vegan style)chicken Fussili was phenomenal. We also started with the vegan buffalo wings yum!!!This place has so much to offer to plant based healthy eaters and carnivores alike. Our server Anthony was friendly knowledgeable. We are so glad to see healthy quality food restaurants in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Kaelen (Kale) rocks !!! This server  deserves a raise! He is always smiling and helpful! Kale always makes you meal a pleasant and wonderful experience! I am so excited about the new full vegan menu! We had the vegan wings and Vegan meatballs. Anyone will the these chickpea isolate meatballs they are incredibly meaty and nothing died for them! The maple bbq wings were amazing as usual!"}
{"text":"Picazzos organic Italian kitchen is a wonderful restaurant if you have special dietary needs. I always get the spicy Thai peanut quinoa bowl. It is a ton of food for 550 cal. Their coconut ice cream and a vegan cheesecake is to die for. One of my close friends late in life found out about a lot of allergies that she has and this restaurant cater to every single one of them!"}
{"text":"Food 4 stars, value for the money 2 stars average 3 stars pizza is way beyond your average pizza joint but their prices are more like gourmet food. Which this is not.  We have been three or four times and I think this s our last time.  Quality to value is too low for me.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this restaurant before. We come here all the time. Will add more details later, but they just unveiled a new vegan menu!"}
{"text":"Back here again with my monthly ladies' lunch group. I ordered the lunch combo: 1 pizza, soup, and a tropical ice tea. The soup was chicken noodle soup today, it was loaded with goodies (carrots, onions, celery, chicken and lots of noodles). The soup was good, not too salty. I ordered the pepperoni pizza. Unfortunately, it is on the extra crispy side. The tip of the pizza was a black and the crust was super crispy. I did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard. It was better last time. The soup and nonstop flowing of ice tea was good. The service is always excellent."}
{"text":"We decided to try this healthy options Italian restaurant while visiting Scottsdale - what a little gem.  We sat outside by the fire and had a surprising 1/2 off bottle of Hess cab. Turkey meatballs and linguine were excellent.  Apple crisp with coconut ice cream a real treat.  Very friendly servers, too.  Enjoy-"}
{"text":"brie with garlic, strawberries and apple and pizza bread was amazing as appetizer. I ate so much of it that i could barely have main course which was a medium pizza, half vortex and half leaning tower.

more on the brie. i loved the roasted garlic. and the sweet strawberries and apple were such a great combination with the cheese and all the herbs on the bread. 

minus one star cuz the waitress served my pizza upside down on my plate and offered zero compensation. 

minus one star cuz the cheese on the leaning tower was too melted! it was the most watery cheese i've ever had. maybe that's why it's called the leaning tower... it causes all the toppings to fall off!

also, the pizza crust was a bit too doughy. i don't mind thick crusts but this crust actually tasted like dough...."}
{"text":"Lovely food! Simply prepared. Nice New Yorker/ Jersey bartender. Happy hour! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had been there about 8 years ago and never came back until last week we were in the area. The atmosphere is fine, the waitstaff was great, but the food is just not that tasty, I am sorry to say. That cheese spinach dip was under seasoned and over cheesed and had barely any spinach in it. I was disappointed. The thai pasta is a far cry from California Pizza Kitchen's equivalent dish. I commend the gluten free menu and given that, you can understand why the pasta is not that good in it, but it is what it is. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Traveled to Phoenix with an Elite soccer team, and selected this restaurant for it organic and gluten free options.  We were seated in their outside dinner area, which fit our group comfortably (25 people).  There were outdoor heaters and a  very attractive outdoor fire, which kept us warm on a cool Phoenix winter evening.  I agree with the other reviews, that the wait staff could use a little more service training.  

Advice:  Smile and check on your guests more frequently.

Food:  The walnut, blue cheese salad was absolutely incredible.  Sliced of strawberries, tear drop tomatoes, walnuts, tangy with balsamic vinegar.  We ordered the Napolitan(super thin crust) Naples Margherita, olive oil, tomato, basil, and a healthy dose of garlic.  Delicious pizza, and thin crust, so the pizza was too filling.

Organic and gluten free pasta?  Sounded strange, but I tried the Shrimp scampi dish, which was made with organic quinoa and gluten free focacia.  The texture was slightly different from any high end Italian restaurant, but the taste of the pasta, sauce, and shrimp was exceptional.  I enjoyed every bit, and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place if you have a dining partner who needs gluten-free, but other than that, it's just o.k.  Nice atmosphere, good baked wings, decent beer selection.   Traditional pizza is nothing to write home about. Everything is a bit overpriced.  We just go here when we happen to be in Scottsdale and don't want to wait in a long line at Oregano's or drive back home to eat at Babbo.

Agree with some of the other comments that the food and menu seems to have lost a step in the past 2-3 years, but I can't quite put my finger on it."}
{"text":"This was our favorite place for date night. Now there is one right down the road from us. And it's really good. Quick lunch good food and happy servers."}
{"text":"In my opinion Picazzo's is better for take out than eating in. We used to get take out from here before more choices of non-chain pizzerias opened up in North Scottsdate. 

The kids and I were out together a couple of weeks ago and I decided I'd introduce them to an old trusted neighborhood favorite. We elected to eat out on the patio since the \"winter\" weather was so inviting. 

The service was terrible, as they were so grossly understaffed that the manager started out taking care of us before dishing us off to the poor waitress that apparently had the entire patio. There were 4 of us and they sat us at a table that would have been better suited for a party of 2. The table filled up quickly with plates, silverware and drinks. Turns out the waitress ended up spilling one of the drink refills all over my end of the table. Lucky for me that the table was not solid and the drink had the opportunity to get cleaned up by my dry, thirsty jeans below. 

So I'm going to be kind here. The food was mediocre at best. My mom insisted I try here parmigiana to make sure it tasted ok. My kids had an extremely tough time with the amount of oil on their Margareta pizza. For me, I couldn't get out fast enough. 

I don't think I'll choose to dine in anytime soon and the idea of take out doesn't make me feel any better. 

I think the nostalgia of this place from days gone by far exceed today's reality."}
{"text":"With a vegan daughter I appreciate restaurants like this with lots of vegan options. She loved the zucchini primavera. Very garlicky, in the best way possible. The prices are why I give 3 stars. Her meal was almost $20. The portions aren't big so I'm not sure why the food is so pricey. We regularly go to vegan, organic restaurants and this place is really expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"About 2 years ago on a vacation to Arizona my daughter-in-law introduced me to Picazzo's.  It was love at first bite.  I am a diagnosed Celiac and never could eat out without having some issue.  Anytime I travel to Phoenix, Sedona, or Flagstaff, Picazzo's is my First and most of time, my only choice in restaurants.   A year ago we moved to Tucson from Pennsylvania and I couldn't wait to eat at my favorite restaurant.  Unfortunately there is not one near me in Tucson, so I make every excuse to travel up to Tempe to my favorite Picazzo's.  Melanie has served me twice there and there is not a better server!  She is always available to assist and supply our every tasty desire.  I also want to give a shout out to Beth the manager, because she thought that we were waiting for something and she was right there to check on us.  A diner couldn't find a more helpful friendly staff.  If you want GREAT Italian food at a fair price, with great service, GMO Free, and Gluten Free, this should be your FIRST choice."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service.  We sat at a table for 10mins before approached by a waiter.  For a casual dining we spent 1.5hrs for some wings and 2 small pizzas.   I will never visit this place again"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is terrible. The people are friendly, the issue is the time it takes to get served. I was very excited to take my husband there and one year-old daughter after having been there twice and loving the food. When we arrived, there were hardly any people dining. The restaurant quickly filled up but our food was not arriving... After people who had arrived after us, long after us, were already eating. By the time we received our food we had a very whiny child and literally had to scarf down our food before leaving toile an appointment. We didn't order anything complicated, a slice of pizza and salad!
I still plan on dining here, but hope to have food served within 15 minutes of ordering not over half an hour!"}
{"text":"Pizza that is fold-able gets 5 stars in my book. The service was a little slow, but in their defense, the place was packed. I will definitely go back.

Also, their lemonade is fantastic."}
{"text":"I drive past this place all the time and I figured I would finally try it out. The place is on a corner of a plaza, really cute, very clean inside. Small so you wouldn't want to take a large group. Cute outside seating as well. I did a take out order.  I ordered the thai peanut chicken dish and also Sriracha slaw for an appetizer. The slaw looked good, didn't taste bad but could definitely use some added flavor. I don't think I would order it again. Thai peanut dish was AWESOME. tons of flavor, a good portion so you will have leftovers. They just came out with a new menu in March so they don't have a printable take home one but I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So I cannot have gluten and this place is amazing. I get to have things like canneloni and tiramisu- and they are great, not some sad gluten free version of the real thing. The white sauce is also on point! It's a little more expensive than average, but if you lead a gluten free life you are used to it. And if you want to go at a cheaper time hit their happy hour, the specials are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wedge salad is delish! Love the fact that it's organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating \"regular\" pizza. I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!"}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials here.  Such a great spot for lunch and the food is delicious.  The service has always been great too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places.  You get a salad and a slice of pizza and both are fantastic.  One of my favorite salads is the berrylicious.  Great for happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Scottsdale for work I stop in for dinner. Traveling alone for business can be lonely, but the bartenders Nick and Amir are awesome, and the wait staff is super friendly and make you feel so welcome. I love the happy hour menu. The caprese salad and turkey meatballs are two of my favorites. The last time I was in I had the baked wings and they were really tasty and light. I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for fresh, organic Italian food, and it's also great for those with gluten sensitivities because there's so many gluten-free items on the menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here again, but I had to update my review. After posting my original review, I received a response from the management that I can only describe as snotty. \"Thank goodness there are so many choices for pizza in the valley.\" If there was any question of me returning, this cemented it as a big fat no."}
{"text":"First and last time. We ordered a spinach dip that came with untoasted bread and a brick of half melted cheese on top. I asked the bartender if I could have a side Caesar salad and he said of course! It came out as a entree size salad, when I made a comment about it he said they don't do sides. Okay; why didn't you tell me that in the first place?!? Our pizza came out with raw crust, and to top it off the bartender was to busy flirting with staff to refill my glass. 

Yes they have gluten free options out the ass; but the service is sub par and the food isn't fully cooked. If you dine with them I wish you luck!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for making the best gluten-free pizza in Scottsdale! We love the organic ingredients. The quality is always awesome and so is the service."}
{"text":"Normally, I think of \"healthy\" as being synonymous with \"just-eat-it-it's-good-for-you-sawdust-is-your-friend\". This place puts the lie to that idea. I had a ceasar with gluten-free bread - UN-BUTTERED - that I couldn't put down. 

I could actually come back here and sincerely LOVE what I'm eating ... plus I COULD STILL FEEL VIRTUOUS AFTER HAVING ACTUALLY ENJOYED A MEAL!

That's what I call Win-Win!!!"}
{"text":"We were shopping in the area and decided that we were in need of refueling, so we stopped off here to grab a bite. We were greeted right away and opted to sit outside on the porch.

Our waitress was out within a minute or so and took our drink orders and filled us in on the daily specials. She was very friendly. I decided on the Chicken Piccata and he decided on the Lasagna - both came with salads, we went with Caesar. 

The piccata was my favorite dish and there was a slight hint of lemon to the sauce, which really kicked up the flavor in my book.  The chicken was obviously fresh and it was cut into perfect bite sized pieces, so no knife needed on this dish!  His lasagna was good, but just wasn't anything to write home about - although I would probably order it again if I was in the mood for a red sauce dish!

The porch atmosphere was nice, but the tables felt really crowded.  There were high tops, as well as, regular tables all lined up in a row and when people walked by it was pretty much assured you were going to get bumped into.  The day was perfect for sitting outside though, so it was worth it!

We were semi-disappointed that they didn't offer a tiramisu dish, but the apple dessert did sound good and may have to happen next go around.

Overall: A-
A touch crowded porch couldn't damper a good meal with a great view and friendly service!"}

Although she's not allergic to Gluten, she enjoys the Gluten Free Pizza here....which I think is bland and lacks taste....

The Stuffed Peppers is awesome, but the Gluten Free Flatbread is crumbly and flavorless....damn, 1/2 this dish is great.

The Wild Mushroom Rotelli is very good.  The Pizza is bland....again, the gluten free Crust is what kills it for me....and I'm a big Pizza Freak, so it's hard for me to type that.

The service here is very good and as long as TBH is happy, I'm happy.

{"text":"Awesome pizza, but the most absolutely horrible delivery service. DO NOT USE THE DELIVERY SERVICE!  They said one hour, after an hour and 15 minutes, we called and they said the driver was minutes away. After 90 minutes, we went to the restaurant 2 minutes away) and the pizzas were still sitting there!  The delivery service had lied, we took the pizzas, cancelled the delivery via phone and they NEVER even apologized! Again, AWESOME PIZZA, terrible delivery service.  UPDATE TO ABOVE REVIEW:  manager of the delivery service called me a few days afterward and apologized for the bad experience and refunded the entire order total (over $120).  I feel like they've redeemed themselves and hopefully will work at not having the same issues in the future.  He said the problems were due to someone being accosted, so who knows.  Great pizza place though."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed!!!!

The wait was long, service was horrible, toppings were skimpy and the salad was not worth the price.  $28 for 2 lunch specials $$$$ the pizza was dry and barley had any toppings and we had to practically beg for a second salad dressing, the one they gave us had about a teaspoon of dressing in it. 

Not the same place it used to be :(  
Wont be going back again."}
{"text":"The service at this place is great however the food is horrible and incredibly over priced. So disappointing. Oreganos is right across the street. Save your money and go there."}
{"text":"The recent changes to the menu have disappointed us. They apparently think nickel & diming their customers is ok in this economic climate. Charging additional for basic additions to pizza is a bit outrageous. Who just gets mozzarella, sauce, crust?! Making me pay more  (and per size, to add insult to injury!) to add one meat and/or one veggie is ridiculous. I could understand if I wanted more than one topping, but at this rate you could pay over 20$ for a tiny little pizza!

As always the food is delcious, but the menu change really left a sour taste in our mouths and we almost left without ordering (adding to the charge by the item issue, they took our favourite pie of all time (the lamb & chevre) off the menu completely. Woe is us. Not sure we'll be back for a long while, to be honest."}
{"text":"I would love to give more stars as the food was amazing, but the service was excruciatingly slow. Enough so that I'm afraid I won't be back as I only get an hour for lunch and this was 90 mins. We tried everything to express to the server we were in a hurry, to no avail. I will definitely order to go, or maybe sit at the bar, but sadly can't count on enjoying a nice lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"Three awesome things about Picazzos in Tempe
1) 100% organic food, and i mean the good stuff (pizza, pasta, salads and chicken wings)
2) The food is YUMMY
3) They have an awesome happy hour every day of the week where you can get 1/2 price appetizers and 1/2 price organic cocktails. 
HOLLER!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom because it has gluten-free options & boy were we impressed!! Great service and EXCELLENT Gluten Free food! My mom had the chicken piccata and ate every single bite! I had linguine with meatballs and it was so delicious!  They have amazing options for Gluten Free diets including pizza, pasta & even gnocchi!! It has a great and enjoyable atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the service is really good. Jackie was especially awesome!!! :)  So get on over there and get you some really good food from some really good people!! 

NOTE: they used to break their pasta and it wasn't good it was always in pieces, but they don't do that anymore and it's perfect!! 

If you have gluten issues this is your place! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there and have to admit that we were a little apprehensive about everything being described as \"organic\" and gourmet in the same sentence, but we were presently surprised.  My husband and I each only ordered a slice of pizza - pepperoni and a spicy Italian.  The crusts were crispy, not soggy.  They could have used a bit more sauce and cheese, but most \"gourmet\" pizza aren't served that way.  We are looking forward to going back and trying their pasta."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful opportunity to eat at Picazzo's.  Service was impeccable, food was wonderful. Fresh and delicious. This was my first visit and I will definitely return. It was nice that the server was able to talk the menu and make suggestions accordingly.  She was very friendly.  The place was bright, clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Their zucchini noodle past dish is delicious! Totally vegan and you don't even realize it. They have a creamy sauce for it and overalls it has great flavor. Very healthy and delicious meal. A little pricy though, ~$18."}
{"text":"I like healthy food and options are slim so I had high hopes for this place.. It had awful music on the outside patio , like bad loud elevator music. Also the food was crappy both appetizer and gluten free veggie pizza. I would have better frozen grocery store frozen pizza. So gross and way over prices. Will never come again.. Disgusting !"}
{"text":"Picazzo's has a fantastic GLUTEN FREE menu.  The staff are all very knowledgeable and go out of their way to accommodate people with food issues.    

Many people that I know with Celiac/GI try to avoid going during peak hours to avoid contamination, so I've always had great service and limited to no wait time and my food has been fantastic every time I've been there.

It is a bit pricey for pizza, but it's so nice to be able to eat out safely.

Would love to open a location in Austin as I don't live in AZ anymore, but whenever I'm there, I always make a trip."}
{"text":"I love Picazzo's they have great food here. There is an outdoor area to dine if you prefer or indoors. The restaurant is always clean and the staff attentive and friendly.
On a recent visit I enjoyed my Caesar salad that had a wonderful dressing which they make themselves! It had a little bite to it which was the perfect compliment to dish that you can't really rave about.
The star of the show was hubby's pasta Bianca dish which was fresh and well seasoned. The prices are reasonable making this a solid dining experience.
Join their mobile rewards for points and be sure to check on yelp for check in specials.
They even provide mouthwash in the bathroom making it easy to freshen up after your Italian meal."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the neighborhood and had a Groupon for Picazzo's and gave it a try this week.  We were there around 7:30 on a Tuesday - it was busy but not crowded.  The interior is decorated warmly and inviting. There is dining up front and a bar in the back with several large TVs.  However, the dining room was very cold so we elected to sit outside as the temp was nice.  There was one other occupied table outside.  The patio is quite plain but the chairs were comfortable.

The menu has a nice selection of starters, salads, pizza's and pastas along with a few non-pasta entrees.  They also have a limited beer and wine menu but I found an IPA I liked and my wife had a tonic and lime.  They have a build to order ravioli and gnocci option so my wife ordered sweet potato ravioli with pesto sauce and I had the gnocchi with Carbonara sauce.

The food arrived pretty timely but without a table service.  We had to remind the server for that.  I can never understand why that is not the first thing they check for when you sit down but hey, it was an easy fix.  The dishes were plated nicely in shallow bowels.  My gnocchi was cooked just right with a ricotta filling and the cause was creamy and garlicky with peas and pancetta.  It was quite tasty.  My wife's ravioli was outstanding with the sweet potato filling.  However, it really clashed with the pesto sauce.  It was a risk when she ordered it but frankly I would not offer that option, it really is a bad mix.

Since this was a quick dinner and we had the groupon discount I was satisfied with the meal.  However, had we wanted appetizers and/or desert the bill would have run pretty high for a casual restaurant. There are other better Italian food places within a few miles with better ambience, service and food at these prices.  I will go back and try them for lunch as I think this might be a better value and the outside seating would be attractive for that during winter days."}
{"text":"Really liked this new place for the first time. The food was delicious and fresh. The service was prompt and friendly. I will definitely be back. There aren't many places with these kind of options in this area. I'll be spreading the word."}
{"text":"Food is great except for the pizza. The dough is too hard. Be aware it's free to substitute chicken with vegan chicken. First time visiting I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza with vegan chicken, the server charged us 3 dollars for the vegan chicken. He was really slow too when it wasnt busy (only 3-4 tables including us) . The second visit I realized on the menu it said substitute vegan style with no charge :(. Still like the food here and have came back multiple times. Just didn't have good experience the first time."}
{"text":"Great gluten-free food and service is awesome"}
{"text":"This place is a dream for celiac's, this place is nearly 100% gluten free- totally uncommon for phx. They do have regular (non gf) pizza crust, but that is cooked on a completely different stone. Beyond that, they have quality gluten free products, there isn't the grainy texture. Beyond that, the service is impeccable, our waitress was super attentive, friendly, and extremely knowledgable about cross contamination. There are also tons of vegan options (vegan cheeses and vegan ice cream). I recommend this place to everyone I meet who is GF."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and wanted a yummy place to eat and catch up with old friends. Friends suggested this place. Ordered the spinach mushroom stuffed chicken and it was delicious. Pizza both gluten and gluten free were delicious. The prices are a bit high and the portions are moderate. Left feeling like I could eat a little bit more. Maybe a bit more veggies would be nice. I would visit restaurant again. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to that menu but they cut out their amazing sandwiches for a trendy fusion thing that was disappointing. We ordered an appetizer that came with bread, fig, leaves, and stale cheese. The pizza was a margarita, but it was bland. They need to get some seasonings."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here every week for a great 'neighborhood bar' dinner. The staff is always courteous and helpful and seem to be having a good time. I enjoy a place where people like to work! 
We go on Monday or Tuesday night to get the summer special these days. Join the Picazzo's club and you get 25% off your order and a bottle of the house wine (which isn't a bad one!) for just $5! 
Last night we had the Thai chicken pizza (with the thin crust) and the Italian chopped salad. Delicious! Another favorite of ours is the Veggie Pizza (with thick crust) and the blue cheese salad. You can order a small salad (plenty for 2 to share) So,,,for $30 we had split a small salad, a large pizza and a bottle of wine! 
By the way, the summer special is only for dinner on Mon/Tues (after 4) and through September."}
{"text":"Somehow, I find myself surrounded by people with celiac disease, so this is a popular place for us to dine.

I've always been impressed by their food -- delicious and cooked to perfection.

With that said, the price is a little high for me, but I do understand why that is -- the quality of their ingredients is superb, and since they cater to the gluten-free community, I see why the markup is necessary.

Service is also great.  I've been half a dozen times, and I have no complaints.  The waiters and waitresses are friendly and understanding, no matter the location. 

I would recommend this place and go back whenever our party calls for it."}
{"text":"Vegan pizza was amazing. Non vegan pizza was also amazing. Staff was super friendly. Only in town for a couple of days but will probably be going back before leaving to go home."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best gluten free pizza out there... they are very diligent about catering to allergies. I make a point to go whenever I am in town!!"}
{"text":"Great local Arizona chain. Organic, locally sourced pizza and Italian food, with some Mediterranean spin. Whole wheat and gluten free crusts are available. Imaginative hummus plates (cranberry!)"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, real food. Our first visit brought us back two days later. Cherry wood-fired bacon pizza, a\"pasta\" dish with spiralized zucchini, quinoa with fresh spinach and arugula, lasagna as comfort food extraordinaire -- each dish was unique and obviously prepared with care. The wait staff was efficient and friendly. We're so glad we discovered Picazzo's."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start. Shawn the manager is AWESOME!! I hosted an event there with 60 ppl and he was there every step of the way help me put out fires and eliminate stress! I am soooo appreciative of Shawn and his awesome staff AND everyone enjoyed the food.  Seriously everyone should check this place out....great service, quality food...totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"If you have severe food allergies BEWARE OF THIS LOCATION!!! Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the company as a whole. The servers are always patient and careful with people who have food allergies (like myself) and the ingredients/recipes are top notch. That being said, this location is a MAJOR EXCEPTION.

Every single time I have eaten here, the dishes are made differently and they always include an ingredient I have specified as a severe allergy. Because these allergies are so severe, I make sure to repeat them at least twice, and usually friends emphasize this as well. 

This last visit was \"the straw that broke the camel's back.\" I will never be visiting this location again and here's why:

When we ordered a loaf of the gluten-free, vegan flatbread for an appetizer, the server argued with me for 5 minutes about how it's not their policy to serve a loaf. I explained that we visit other the locations in Scottsdale, Flagstaff, Sedona, and Paradise Valley frequently and they all give the full loaf. The manager came out to explain the same thing and they didn't offer a solution.

When my cauliflower alfredo pasta arrived, I immediately noticed that it had peas in it, which were explained as a severe allergy. I don't necessarily blame the server because the kitchen should be responsible for preparing the dish exactly how it is described. She apologized profusely because peas are NOT part of the recipe, and had the kitchen remake it. Later that night and the following week I dealt with an extremely severe reaction, only caused by peas. It's hard to say if they just removed them from the original dish, or they were added to the sauce already and no one cared, but either way, that is absolutely unacceptable.

Besides having a reaction to the contaminated dish, it tasted extremely bland and not at all like dish normally does. Plus, the slice of gluten free vegan flatbread that comes on the side was also undercooked and tasted awful. Good thing we weren't given the full loaf!

I'm not sure why this location is so terrible in comparison to the others, but I sincerely warn those with food allergies -- DO NOT RISK IT -- drive a little farther to one of the other locations!!"}
{"text":"Salad was 1/2 the size it used to be. Sat is in the bar, and I got tore up by mosquitos. When I went and told the manager we had to sit somewhere else, she said o ya I know, they're really bad in the bar. REALLY!!!!??? Also, my salad said 11.00 and 3.50 to add chicken. According to my math, I adds up to 14.50, bit it was 15.50 on the bill. Last time I go there."}
{"text":"It's a great looking place, in a busy mega strip mall.

It was lunch and when we arrived the dining room was full. A small tight bar table or bar counter was offered, so we opted for the high top table across from the bar.

Prices seemed a little high so assuming large portions we ordered The $12 Artichoke Bottoms appetizer and a $15 meat pizza. Both were tasty, but we were served with a thimble size portion of regular Parmesan cheese to go with. A request for more was quickly delivered.

2 choices for Ice Tea offered, and my black tea was just fine and refilled several times. Our table was set with 1 roll up and food was delivered without fixing that. we grabbed one off the bar because it was in arms reach, and our server was pretty busy.

Gluten free and organic choices abound, and I imagine we could find more healthy options next time, but they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Easily the best GLUTEN FREE pizza that my family and I have had anywhere in the world. Thank you Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"I love this place for several reasons.  First and foremost it is healthy, offers many varieties for people with food sensitivities or allergies (or preference!) and has a large variety of menu options.  The service is great, the bartender seems to have been there for a while and let me know about a rewards program with my telephone number which was great.  Yes, the prices are high but I can understand for what they offer.  Portions are pretty large, usually have leftovers for lunch/later.  My kids enjoy it for both takeout and dining in.  It's clean, has a nice ambiance and offers outdoor dining which is lovely when it isn't too hot!"}
{"text":"This was my first time getting take out or eating anything at this restaurant. I had a co worker pick up the to go order for two of us in the office. When I opened my Linguini and Meatballs with a Caesar Salad it was the most depressing $15 lunch I have ever had. The portion size was tiny and the quality was not sufficient to justify a $15 price tag! I don't mind paying for good food but this doesn't live up to my expectations of organic and fresh. It was pre made portions with sauce on top. The flavor was bland and not satisfying."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!! Kara is an absolutely incredible server (ask for her) and Steve is an awesome GM!  Food is beyond amazing too. It's healthy, tasty and a great family environment!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Picazzo's a few times and have come to the conclusion it is just ok. I think if you are gf this place would be amazing as most of their dishes come as gf. So if you have jumped on the gluten free bandwagon  this place is for you.  From pizza to pastas your taste buds will be happy.  If you are a \"normal\" eater it is pretty good, but nothing to write home about.
Service - 7
Atmosphere - 5
Food - 5
Price - 7
So check it out if you have a gf member in your party, if not head over to Oreganos for a better pizza pie!"}
{"text":"Very tasty dishes of very healthy fare.  So nice to find healthy food in a restaurant setting.  Many tasty options for gluten free, organic, whole grain, etc.  The pizzas were a bit pricey...but what do you expect.  I had the chicken-chorizo pasta and it was priced right at $10 and had some unique ingredients.  Love it!  We were here late on a Sunday night...plenty of seating available, chill atmosphere, plenty of parking.  Great place.  I wish we had these in SoCal."}
{"text":"Came here on New Year's Eve - definitely coming back. Quaint yet classy. Ordered delicious vegetarian options that didn't disappoint! Staff were friendly & attentive & looked like they enjoyed their jobs & even hugged what appeared to be long-time customers or possibly family! A feel-good experience to say the least."}
{"text":"I've been eating regularly at Picazzo's Tempe since it first opened, and I still by and large like the food. The gluten-free pizzas are delicious. With that being said, after my most recent visits, the service has been bothering me enough to update my review. 

Many of the waiters are in the habit of wearing extremely strong colognes and perfumes. The smell overwhelms and nauseates me, and ruins my appetite every time they pass by my table. You should not be able to smell someone from several feet away, let alone strongly smell them.

Service is often slow. Even when the restaurant is nearly empty, it often takes a long time for someone to come take your order. Likewise, it often takes unreasonably long for a waiter to return with your credit card when you pay. 

Waiters always use that obnoxious phrase \"are you still working on that\". Eww. The enjoyment of a fine meal is not \"work\", and it's just so off-putting to hear it described that way, as if eating the food was a chore. I'm not a pig at the trough."}
{"text":"I've tried the pizza in the past and it was to be honest, nothing to write home about. I try not to judge restaurants on the first go around though so on my lunch break today, I decided to give it another try. 

They have a few different lunch specials, but their pasta lunch specials include the choice of pasta, a side salad and a drink (iced tea, coffee or an organic soda). I opted for the Eggplant Parmigiana with a Caesar salad and OMG, it was delicious!! I would consider myself a connoisseur of eggplant/chicken parmigiana, very picky to say the least and their version more then exceeded my expectations. 

It takes a bit longer for the dish to come out of the kitchen as they bake each serving under the broiler to get the cheese all hot and bubbly, but it's well worth the wait. With Italian food it's so easy to overeat but Picazzo's has done a great job with portioning- enough to satisfy, but not enough to fill you with regret later on... 

For a drink I ordered the Lemonade Cooler, which is a concoction of Rain (organic) Vodka, Chambord and lemonade. Yummmmm! It was strong enough to wash away the stress of my busy morning at work, but not enough to prevent me from kicking butt when I got back to the office. 

As my lunch special came with a drink and I didn't have time to have a post-meal cup of coffee, the waitress offered to give me an iced coffee in a to-go cup. The coffee comes pre-sweetened (with natural, organic sweetener I believe...), but the waitress was thoughtful enough to bring over the sugar packets and a bit of creamer. With a splash of creamer and a quick stir, I left Picazzo's feeling satisfied, happy and ready to conquer the rest of my day. :)"}
{"text":"Great Stuff.  It's hard for a diehard traveling pizza lover to often find some loveable pizza but I did here."}
{"text":"The servers are great.  The food is great.  I love that it is safe for me to eat and tastes good enough that my husband enjoys eating here too."}
{"text":"The ambience and location give it 5 stars alone. What a place. Great healthy food and wonderful service. Outside patio is nice and the Japanese restaurant by it is amazing if this place fills up."}
{"text":"\"Both ghee and clarified butter have the milk proteins (casein and whey) removed and what remains is butter fat. Casein and whey are proteins in dairy that many people do not tolerate, especially people who cannot tolerate gluten\".

The following excerpt is for the staff / employees at this location to help them better understand the difference between Butter and Parmesan cheese.

If someone is asking about Vegan and Gluten and Organic options etc; it might be worth while telling someone if you plan on adding cheese to their order without telling them. In this instance it was very clear I had not seen this item on the menu, that I had food allergies and was trying to ask what went into the order. Maybe I didn't ask enough questions perhaps, but still. This is just for future reference not to be rude or mean.

I was already pretty stressed and feeling VERY VERY ill when I got there so this in combination with a few other minor mishaps was the icing on the cake. 

Apparently if you walk in with a $20 it a big deal and they have to find the person that originally placed your order and then walk all the way over to the bar for crying out loud just to get you change. As if you just walked into a late night convenience store in the middle the night and all the real money is hidden and locked away.

The food is really good though and the service overall is pretty decent. However paying a bit more attention to detail and the basics handling order might be help things run a lot smoother in the long run with less stress for everyone.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ummmm. If your going to say your organic and pride yourself in being mindful of your ingredients why in the heck would you use  canola oil instead of real olive oil in Italian restaurant of all places?! 

You are taking healthy food and adding something to it that really doesn't belong. There is a wide body of research out there to demonstrates how detrimental this is to people's health. 

I really hope you give this some serious consideration before continuing to add this to your salads and pizzas. I'm giving 3 stars though because overall at least striving to be organic and ordering local food and at least trying to have healthy options is admirable. 

However if you really care like you say you do than you should use real food ingredients and not cut corners like this. Seriously you charge a premium for you food from the sounds of it; so one would hope to not get a cheap alternative to the real deal when it comes to oil. 

There are probably some folks in Italy that would be rolling over in their graves right about now if they heard about this.

Ciao!

As an update I'm giving four stars because the customer service is pretty good and the food taste great! Also the decor is very nice and the restrooms were clean and even a bit classy in my opinion.

Well Done, Bravo.

In response to the restaurants feedback that is really good to hear your looking at alternatives. From my understanding even non GMO canola oil is less than ideal; and in my humble opinion you would probably be far better suited with the sunflower oil for the health of your employees and patrons. 

It's possible I may be off base here but I would say this is definitely worth looking into and the fact that you are speaks volume. If I had know this when I spoke after speaking with someone there while placing an order I probably would have had less to say about this. 

It's just that it's extremely difficult to find very good healthy organic food these days and it's a just a bit of a shame when you find a place that is doing so many other things well and you see or hear about something like this. Overall the good far outweighs the area of concern though. 

Thanks you;      

It's good to know this concerns are not just falling on deaf ears."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Amazing staff. Bringing Nick over from the Scottsdale location was the best thing a new branch could do. 

Sharissa is an incredible bartender and provided a great experience.  I will certainly be a regular at this location based off this great team, fantastic food and overall convenience. 

Food Rec:

Appetizer: artichoke dip
Main: spicy meatball pizza - extra crispy gluten free crust and extra extra sauce."}
{"text":"I simply love the food here. the berrylicious salad, puttanesca pizza, the veggie pizza and much more. I Love al. being nearby to my workplace, it's a preferred place for most luncheons."}
{"text":"I can see why this location has lower ratings than the one in Sedona; on my recent visit to the Sedona location, my experience was nothing less than perfect. The same cannot be said for the Tempe location.

We sat at the bar because there was a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table, which makes sense on a Saturday night. That was the first mistake. The bartenders were much more occupied with making drinks than checking on the status of our food. While they were both very nice, they spent a lot of time talking to each other that probably could have been used more productively.

Our food was taking a rather long time to come out, even for a Saturday, especially since we had ordered an appetizer. When we inquired into the status of said appetizer, the male bartender went to check and came back with ALL our food at once. It was clear the food had been sitting for some time, as our vegan chicken wings and the vegan chicken on my salad were not even remotely warm, and my mom's pizza was just barely warm.

If the food had been delivered when it was first ready, it would have be absolutely delicious. No complaints there; kudos to the chefs and cooks in the kitchen! The bartenders, on the other hand, provided very poor service. My mom's drink, a berry mojito, was astonishingly bitter, and I love sour things. By the time we asked for to-go boxes, the two bartenders were so busy chatting with one another that the female one did not even bring all the containers I had requested, and I had to ask again.

Generally speaking, it seems like the quality of food is just as high at this location as it is at the Sedona location which my boyfriend and I so loved. However, when I return, I definitely will not be sitting at the bar, even if I have to wait 20 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"For a place that has \"vegan\" on the cover of their menu, this place is doing it all wrong. First off, Picazzo's has changed. Their menu includes far fewer vegan items than it used to. Now, if you want something to be vegan, it has to be gluten free too. They changed their bread so that it is not vegan. Pretty bizarre for place claiming to be vegan friendly. Especially when bread is typically vegan. They were not willing to make cheese bread vegan, when they have vegan cheese and flatbread they could use. And all of their pasta has egg in it, which is just disgusting. It is so easy to make normal semolina wheat flour pasta. Why is the only vegan option the gluten free rice pasta? Gross. For a restaurant claiming to be sensitive to people's dietary needs, they have no grasp of how the world works. Vegans are largely not gluten free. They should not be lumped into the same category and left with dry cardboard pasta as their only option. I used to love this place. But now that they have nothing decent I can eat, I'm pretty close to done with them.

Other than that, the food is generally good. Service is mixed, depending on the night. I do enjoy the vegan options they have available, I am just severely disappointed by the changes that have been made and the backwards step this restaurant has taken in the vegan direction. If they didn't advertise themselves as vegan friendly, this would be a different story.

If management reads this, please consider offering a vegan pasta that is not gluten free. A linguine or spaghetti would be nice, as that's what most of the pasta dishes are designed to be, and they don't work well with penne. It is so easy to get vegan pasta. I don't understand the obsessesion with adding eggs to things."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a few friends on a Saturday, and we were all pretty disappointed. Overall, Picazzo's seems pretty full of themselves. When one of our drink orders came out wrong (diet coke instead of regular) the server looked at us like we were nuts. Sorry? Really didn't think that should have been such a big deal.

The food was not worth the price, it seems like this restaurant thinks they can get away with murder because they are all over organic ingredients and gluten-free crusts. Gluten-free or not, the margherita pizza was bland and tasteless. Covered in a thin sheen of olive oil (for flavor?) and skimped on the tomatoes and basil, it was dolled up cheese bread. The fruit and brie appetizer was okay, but the attention paid to presentation made it nearly impossible to eat. The pear-half and strawberry that came with our hunk of melted brie were really just incompletely sliced and that was supposed to look frou-frou? We had to remove the fruit to slice it completely so it could actually be eaten by more than one person; sort of the point of an appetizer, right? They also threw two heads of roasted garlic in the brie. While I can't deny that a whole head of roasted garlic is a beautiful thing, papery garlic skins mixed in with your melted brie are not. Neither is having to squeeze scalding hot cloves of roasted garlic into your brie. I was the only one in my group of friends who has roasted my own garlic so I had to wrap it in my napkin and squeeze it out onto a plate, again so more than one person could actually eat it. At this point we were all laughing at the ridiculousness of the restaurant and it's prices.

I hate to rate it so low, because I really think there could be potential here! Italian food gone organic and accommodating to dietary needs? Could be great, just seems like they've got no soul and there is no real attention paid to the quality of the food, which comes across as just profiting from the bandwagon."}
{"text":"Finally a great healthy place on this side of town. Awesome service and food! Gluten free and veggie choices exceptional."}
{"text":"My son and I came here to eat dinner. I was hoping this would be a clean and healthy restaurant. I ordered a salad. The salad had not been washed before it was prepared and served. I literal spit out grains of dirt. I sent the salad back and still paid for it."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I'm vegan but my boyfriend is not and they had options for us both! Almost anything made with animal products you could get made vegan! I loved it! We sat at the bar and the bartender was fabulous! She was very knowledgeable about vegan sauces and dishes! We got our food boxed and forgot it just to be reminded when a server chased after us in the parking lot to bring them to us! What customer service! This is a house salad which was amazing! With vegan balsamic! Check out my review at @courtneysalads on instagram! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place for lunch, although it was a bit pricey at about $15 per person.

I ordered the Buddha Bowl, which is one of their quinoa bowls. It had a variety of leafy greens, quinoa, feta, tomatoes, corn, and other veggies. It also had sweet potatoes, avocado, and marinated shrimp. The only slightly odd thing was that the sweet potatoes were barely cooked (almost raw...very hard). Other than that, I loved my order. (The fresh bread was awesome, too!) I also ordered their jasmine green iced tea, which was top notch.

My aunt ordered a pick 2 combo which seemed to be a great deal - 1 pasta/pizza slice + 1 salad/soup + 1 beverage for around $15. It offered good portions and a nice variety. 

Would love to come back on future trips to Scottsdale. Even though they are a bit of a chain (I think there are at least three in the Phoenix area), it didn't seem overly streamlined or processed. They offer a nice variety of gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options that are all organic. We enjoyed sitting out on the patio, and our waiter was great!"}
{"text":"This place is all about pizza and salads and they really do it right. I frequently order the BBQ chicken pizza and the spinach salad. The French feta they put on the spinach salad is soooo good. It's very soft and tangy. They do an awesome lunch special for under $10 with a slice and a salad. On the regular menu, the \"small\" salads are ginormous and could definitely feed two people. Picazzo's rules. P.S. You can get any medium pizza made with gluten-free dough :)"}
{"text":"Walked in tonight.  We had a Groupon and I had wanted to try this place for a long time anyway.  The place wasn't packed at 5pm (yeah we were eating early tonight).  Greeted immediately and given the choice to find a bar table or sit in main dining room.  The ambience was right on.  Minimalist decoration but perfectly adequate.  We chose bar seating.  Walking in, the bar was a little warm, but I think most places in the valley are overly air-condtioned anyway, so no big deal.  I like warm.  The guy behind the bar (later found his name was Augustin), was slammed.  He had a couple customers sitting at actual bar, but he was waiting 4-5 tables besides us in the bar area himself.  He made it over as soon as he was able and brought us food.  While the hostess who greeted us had been friendly, she had not offered us menus or followed us to bar with menus.  We did wait a few minutes to be recognized, totally understandable as busy as the guy behind the bar was.  When we finally placed drink orders, they ended up being out of the BF's beer-no big deal-he chose another.  Ordered right before end of happy hour (by about 11 minutes)-including a 1/2-off appetizer (hummus).  Later, we would be charged the HH price for hummus but not for drinks (meh...it would have amounted to $2 off anyway).  Hummus was pretty damn good.  Served with bean chips, bread, cucumber with olives and feta and a couple whole chickpeas on top.  5 stars for the hummus-especially considering the $5 price.  Food is local, organic, pricey-as expected.  We decided on quinoa bowls.  I got the super quinoa, BF got spicy Thai quinoa bowl, and the kiddo got kids create-your-own pizza.  Kiddo says his pizza was good.  He's a kid!  It looked dang good.  Also came with choice of sides, he chose strawberrries.  The side choices are healthy and awesome.  Our bowls were pretty darn good also, although, having visited Pomegranate Cafe in my own 'hood a time or two, I instantly compared the two and decided I would have preferred to pay same high prices at Pomegranate.  Augustin worked his butt off, busy the whole time, and never anything but absolutely friendly and professional despite never seeming to have a second to think.  About half way through our dinner, we noticed a woman behind the bar who had greeted us on arrival.  She was not wearing what seemed to be the traditional employee uniform of black polo shirt.  We assumed she was at least the manager if not higher up.  She made small talk with a patron at the bar, seemed very friendly, but also seemed to have gave 2 F***s that the only server in the bar was swamped and that we had ourselves waited 15+ minutes just for drinks.  That is super poor team work, let alone absolutely horrible managerial skills.  I will take some freedoms with making this claims, because I have been a charge nurse in a busy unit and would NEVER think of letting my nurses sink like that.  Isn't the purpose of a manager (or owner?) to provide all customers with the best experience they can have?  That includes helping a busy server who is literally killing himself managing EVERY table as well as every bar customer!  For this reason, as well as our wait because our poor waiter was being murdered with volume, this place gets 3 stars.  I may have otherwise given at least 4, if not 5.  The lack of support given by this woman was unbelievable.  Were I a restaurant owner, and if I witnessed ANY supervisor act with such utter disregard for team work and customer service, I may strongly reconsider that person's employment status.  This is how strongly I feel about her chatting up a single customer in front of us while we waited patiently for our poor server to have a second to look our way.  I want to be perfectly clear-we were given good service every chance he got to pay attention to us-but the fact that he was not given any assistance by the woman (who also BTW was noted to stand at the counter under the \"kitchen\" sign for a good deal of time-confirming at least her employment or involvement with the restaurant), literally left me angry.  Anyway...food 4.5 stars.  Service (when he could give us service-thanks Augustin) 5 stars-even though we waited quite a while to place drink order and receive ALL the drinks.  Team work/management-1 star.  Will I be back?  Meh!  Not sure considering I get more attention at Pomegranate Cafe for same amount of $$ and same great quality food.  Im not saying this is on my never list, but they need to step up their game."}
{"text":"We first went to Picazzo's the first week they opened and have enjoyed it every time we go there. The BBQ Chicken pizza is the best and their lasagna is great. Our servers, Collin and Shaunta alway treat us like family and make sure our order is perfect. It's great to have an Organic Italian restaurant with healthy food and friendly service."}
{"text":"aaaaaaaaaaack! 

I just stopped by here for a slice and salad combo. I hadnt been in for a couple years, and man things have changed.

first up was the salad. I was so psyched on life when I saw how huge it was! One bite and I quickly knew I wouldnt be eating much more. I got the ceasar salad and the dressing tasted \"off\", the salad itself was pretty warm. Not a welcoming salad at all. 

Then came the pizza. The pizza here used to be really good. Not so much anymore. It was all dried out and crusty. 

I tossed my lunch and am thankful I had an apple squirrled away in the fridge. $8 down the drain."}
{"text":"Went two days in a row to be sure it was really as bad as it is.  Shrimp scampi is a good example, chopped spaghetti with  a dozen popcorn shrimp stirred in, small portion served cool, high priced for warmed over \"stuff\""}
{"text":"My pizza was good, but I bit down on something hard and lost my front tooth!  Looked like a small chicken bone. The manager kept it for their insurance, who I called, and sent them my $2,400. dental bill for a new tooth. Their insurance did NOTHING about it. VERY disappointed.  A big waste of time and money. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Everything sounds so good! 
Love the attention to gluten free and vegan options! Finally a restaurant I dont have to stress about!"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Piccazzo's in Scottsdale because we had a $50.00 gift card for the restaurant. I gave the gift card and booklet with the restaurant listed to the waitress to verify. The response from the waitress was that her manager tried to use the gift card and it did not work. The manager did not offer to come speak to us, or even compensate for the fact that their restaurant was listed as an accepted restaurant for the gift card. As a manager  he could have at least had the decency to come explain and could have offered an appetizer or some sort or compensation for the inconvenience but nothing was done. The customer service was poor and I was very disappointed with my first experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! Artichoke appetizer, Gluten free focaccia bread, Spicy Thai peanut fusilli, tiramisu and everything else we had was so good, so fresh and gluten free! Yum!
Great service too!"}
{"text":"Pizza = not very good and very over priced
Salads = pretty inventive (won best salad in either Phoenix Magazine or The New Times at some point in the past)
Total experience = safe place to take someone when you don't know much about their food preferences.
Pretty generically decent."}
{"text":"I've been gluten free for 4 years after being diagnosed with celiacs disease... it's been extremely hard to find GOOD gluten free places in Peoria, AZ. I'm here to say picazzos is AMAZING!!!! This is by far my absolute favorite restaurant ever. I haven't had pasta or bread in so long because all store brand GF things are gross af. But picazzos has restored my faith in humanity and gluten free foods. I am writing this while snacking on the foccocia bread (or however you spell it) happy as can be. Wow. It's so good. Picazzos, if you ever need anymore people to work here I will quit my job ASAP and come join the team. Like goodness. Thank you picazzos"}
{"text":"Love love love! The food and service here is amazing! Got a table immediately, host and our server were super nice and on it! I had lasagna... Extraordinary!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I've been a Celiac since I was a kid and being able to walk into a restaurant, an Italian restaurant at that, and know that ANYTHING I order is safe was an indescribable feeling. On top of it, I'm newly vegan and this menu is extremely accommodating for vegans. No upcharges either - 
I had the vegan buffalo chikin strips - crispy, meaty abs perfect to satisfy my wings craving. We had two vegan sauce options as well. 
I also had the vegan Alfredo with spinach and vegan chikin - delicious!!!! Creamy and cheesy. Good portion. GF pasta texture was spot on. My boyfriend got the spicy peanut dish with zoodles - also at no upcharge. 
Rounded it all off with a vegan cheesecake! 
Let us not forget the OUTSTANDING wait staff as well - they are super knowledgeable and are very patient with questions. They knew exactly what dishes were vegan and how to help us navigate. Really great customer service!! 

Go here as soon as you can - you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I have to admit, I'd addicted to Picazzo's! Where else can you go when you're gluten free, living in Phoenix and absolutely LOVE, and I do mean LOVE, Italian. One mouthwatering word: Picazzo's. 

They get it right from the texture of the GF pizza crust to the taste to the million toppings you can concoct on it. Also, they have a plethora of other goodies such as spinach and artichoke dip, Mama's Meatballs and the perfect pesto pasta dish. The regular foods not too bad either I hear, I'll take my boyfriends word on it."}
{"text":"I've only come here for lunch and never been disappointed . Friendly service , great food and they even give you a to go drink when your all done :) .. I always get the lunch special with slice of pizza and salad which includes a drink (about $11.50) .. You have the option of gluten free slices and the organic salads are fresh and delish.. This is also the 1st place I've seen with Himalayan pink sea salt at the table ;) 
If your looking for a healthy lunch choice this is the place to try ;)"}
{"text":"From a couple of months back.

No coffee ready took quite a while because they didn't have cups clean. NO ,really.  No chipotle wings because they are out of sauce. Server walked off before wife could order. 10 plus mins to return so you can guess how this review is going to add up. 

Wife got angry with me because my surprise was quite audible re the cup excuse.10-15 mins to locate and clean a cup but at that point I was just hoping to get the meal over with. 

Maybe it's my own fault but the service kinda changed from dismissive to not quite hostile but with a degree of contempt usually found  on staff at  tow yards. If you have a gluten free family member it's really really hard to find places to go  but at near $80 bill for 3 GF pizzas, 1 app and no real drinks  it just doesn't have the service to cover  the cost for \"ok\" pizza.  Really not doing a food review because if you have any reason at all to eat real pizza you don't need to come here:)"}
{"text":"The husband and I almost always order the baked chicken wings (no sauce), the Greek Salad, and the Puttanesca pizza. Oh, the Puttanesca pizza... yum. We've tried a few other things, but these are definitely our favorites. The happy hour drink specials aren't anything special, but all appetizers are 50% off. There are lunch specials as well, but we really like this place as a quick dinner spot. They have a power card, so every $100 spent, you get $10 off. This is nice and can add up quickly. For an Arizona chain, this place has some good gourmet pizza."}
{"text":"Best sausage, pepperoni & ricotta pizza!! Also love the pear Gorgonzola salad. Must try!!"}
{"text":"Wow! So many Gluten free and dairy free options to choose from! The alfredo pizza was amazing. My boys lobed their kids pizzas with gf crust and df cheese. My tomato bisque was spicy but delicious. Even some yummy GF bread to dip in it!  Service was good. The restaurant was a little loud and cramped but we can't wait to go back! Loved the food!"}
{"text":"Been a fan of this restaurant for many many years, especially of their roasted garlic and Brie appetizer. Visited on a Saturday where it was pretty quiet, around 2pm. Ordered two lunch specials and the garlic and Brie appetizer. Lunch plates came out and we asked where the Brie was. Server forgot to place the order. 7-8 minutes later the appetizer comes out. The Brie is an overheated greasy, oily mess and there's no garlic. We inform the manager, and then are brought out a small container of room temperature cooked garlic cloves. My guess is this was pulled from the prep bin for their pizzas as it's usually two freshly roasted bulbs of garlic. Very unappetizing and truly disappointed. Only received a quick \"sorry\" from the server for the whole thing. Probably won't return, unfortunately."}
{"text":"L-O-V-E IT.  Been visiting Picazzo's for over 7 years.  Organic, gluten free options can't be beat.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff make for an amazing experience.  Recommend the brie and roasted garlic appetizer - very tasty.  The Pasta and Pizza are all very good.  Signed up for the Picazzo's rewards card to earn discounts.  The owner takes pride in every aspect of this restaurant.  

Excellent choice for lunch, dinner, or HH.

**Update: This location has changed it's name to Buon Gusto Gourmet Pizza, the menu is basically the same!"}
{"text":"Okay, I am SO happy they brought this to the west valley! They do not have enough healthy restaurants around here!

Their lunch special is amazing! I've had a few different kinds of pastas and all have been so flavorful. I've also had some of their pizzas and same thing... really good. 

The price for dinner is a little pricey for my taste though. I know they are organic and meet a lot of needs like gluten free and dairy free but I do think they are a little too expensive. 

It is worth coming here and trying it. Come for lunch or for happy hour and I'm sure you'll be happy!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, best lunch specials around and our server Anthony goes over and beyond to make our experience great!"}
{"text":"We visited for the first time after the lunch hour rush on a Saturday.  I was intrigued to see the organic and fresh menu items.  Nice outside patio.  Waitress was pleasant but frazzled.  Service, a little on the slow side, but we weren't in any rush.

I ordered the kale Caesar salad.  It was tasty, although some of the salad on the bottom was icy cold so I believe it wasn't freshly made but simply pulled from a frig and put on a plate. A bit disappointing; however, I liked that the salad wasn't drenched in dressing.  My husband ordered a plain Caesar salad and spaghetti.  He said his meal was pretty average.  Nothing outstanding.  Soon after leaving, though, my husband became very ill.

It could have been a flu bug.  It could have been the food.  Hard to say.  I'm pretty sure my husband won't be back."}
{"text":"Wanted something light after eating heavy all day and this was perfect. The staff was cool as we did arrive shortly before closing. The pasta & sauce was flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write because the food was delicious.  But we will not return for many reasons, and I think that those reasons explain my rating.  When you approach the building, the window reads \"gluten free\", \"organic\", \"non-GMO\" and lots of other marketing buzz-words, all of which may be true.  However, this prices here are far too expensive.  I understand that people will pay a premium for trendy organic food, but the ambiance here is reminiscent of a cafe or diner, while the prices are from a fine dining Italian restaurant.  $12 for a meatball-  appetizer?  $11 for a hummus plate appetizer?  $18 for pasta dishes?  $29 for 16\" pizzas?  So you logically assume that for those prices, it must be REALLY high quality - think again.  I had the gnocchi with spicy sausage, and it was delicious.  But it was $16.50, and that is steep for gnocchi in red sauce, so I asked the server if the gnocchi was made in-house.  He replied \"no\".  So I just paid $16.50 for someone to buy 3rd party gnocchi and add red sauce.  My wife had the spicy Thai peanut quinoa bowl.  Also delicious.  Just one problem - no quinoa.  It was essentially stir fried broccoli slaw with peanut sauce and some quinoa sprinkled over the top.  Again, we asked the server (who was a very good server, by the way) if there was supposed to be more quinoa in the dish.  He stated \"yes, but my pasta chef is out today\".  So we just paid $10.95 for a quinoa bowl with no quinoa (this is by far the cheapest thing on the menu, including most appetizers and salads).  To be fair, we used a Groupon, so the final bill was not as much as it could have been.  But I am writing this from the perspective of someone paying full price.  So in summary, the food tasted really good, and that's gets one star.  The server was solid, and that gets a second star.  But I cannot give any stars for ambiance or overall value.  If the prices were cut by 30%, I could probably get behind this restaurant in some way.  But right now I feel like the old Picazzo's, which I've eaten at many times, simply poorly reinvented itself as a trendy gimmick restaurant to capitalize on the wave of healthy fads.  I commend Picazzo's for identifying the unmet need in our community for healthier food, and many of the reviews on Yelp seem to indicate that this is appreciated.  But in my opinion, to justify these prices, a far better product and atmosphere is required."}
{"text":"Pizza was good we got nonnas favorite. But what made the experience wonderful was our server Nicole. She was friendly,accommodating, and just flowed with the pace of the restaurant not missing a beat. My mom and I enjoyed ourselves and will be back."}
{"text":"One of the truly great places in Phoenix I can take my wife who has a gluten allergy where she doesn't have to worry about what's on the menu! I've tried many things on the menu before and it's all been good! The service is usually pretty friendly but can be slow on occasion. I assume it's because the food is being freshly prepared and cooked but I cannot confirm this."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. I took my wife and kids for Mother's Day and unfortunately had a very inattentive server who had difficulty taking our order to begin with and took my drink for a refill and never came back with it. She came with our food (which was wrong) about 45 minutes later and I reminded her that she took my drink. She looked puzzled and said she would take our food back and get me a new drink. I told her not to bother and that we were not going to wait any more for our food. I am not sure why the service was so slow since the place was fairly empty. We ended up leaving and going to their PV Mall location where we ended up getting good, speedy service as well as the food we wanted."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Picazzo's. I was thrilled to see the menu was organic (and therefore non-GMO). I was also with a friend who was vegetarian and we have vegan friends. The menu clearly delineates vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free. They even make gluten-free pizzas in a dedicated oven so that it doesn't come in contact with other gluten-laden pizzas. While I don't have celiac, I know how debilitating it can be for some - even if food just comes in contact with another food containing gluten. We had the gnocchi (mine with Gorgonzola cream sauce) and it was delicious!  I'm so excited to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Yes! Large and creative selection of salads, bowls, healthy food. Happy Hour! I loved the Zo Salad. The creamy Italian dressing was SO garlicky. There were so many flavors and textures in this salad. The cheesy bread was a little too spongy for me. Sangria was good. Kelsey our waitress was super nice. Well priced menu. Nice trendy decor."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Picazzo! I wasn't expecting much, and I found myself delighted by the options and stuffed enough to bring home some leftovers. The veggies are ROCK STAR awesome!!! The meatballs are solid (flavor, not consistency), and the drinks, well let's just say this mama was very pleased with the blueberry mojito after a looooong day with two bickering kids. 

Service was great. Very friendly and happy to answer lots of questions.

We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best gluten free vegetarian pizza we have ever had.  Appetizers are the BOMB! Entire staff  has been polite and friendly every time we have been there. Prices are right on. Not one thing bad about this place.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch. They have a great selection of amazingly fresh and delicious gluten free food. Dinner looks to be a bit pricey but most good gluten free food does cost more. I like lunch because they have a mix and match deal. (Chose from salad and pizza, or salad and pasta, or... you get the idea :) 
And the desserts are so yummy. 
I am also a fan of their flavored green tea."}
{"text":"I will eat here every time I visit Phoenix, AZ!  It was THAT good!  

The service was fabulous!  Morgan gave us the best customer service, understood our dietary restrictions, answered our questions on the menu, and checked on us regularly!  We could not have asked for anything more.

The food-wow!  Just, wow!!!  It was so tasty, fresh, and filling.  The portions were huge.  I had the eggplant parmigiana with their house salad and a side of Alfredo pasta.  Everything is homemade, even the pasta!  My companion had the chicken parmigiana with the roasted sweet potatoes!  She raved about it as well.  She said you could taste the fresh ingredients.  We checked in here on Yelp and got a free dessert.  We choose the cheesecake, and after we ate it, Morgan told us it was \"diet\", meaning dairy free.  I would have never know that if she didn't tell me.  It was amazing.  

The atmosphere was fun!  We sat outside on a covered patio with little white twinkle lights.  It was a cool Jan night, so the server put the heat lamp on for me, but I eventually asked her to turn it off, it was just so nice!  There was no wait to be seated, although the inside restaurant was busy.  They also had a bar area with a football game on the TVs, so something for everyone!

Parking was free and easy.  They are tucked into a strip center, and it didn't seem like the other businesses are open at night, which left them plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite spot to eat for lunch near my office in Kierland. The service is always great, and even more importantly, the food is consistent, healthy and AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I really like the lunch options. You can choose your salad, and add pizza or pasta and a drink. I think the salads offered here are better than most. And they also offer zucchini noodles instead of regular pasta. I think almost everyone can find something on this menu that they would like. Very clean, very consistent place."}
{"text":"Dear holy awesome gluten free menu!!! 

I'm 100% excited for a restaurant that's been approved by a celiac association - and they display it right on their door! Everything here is awesome - I had the gluten free crush pizza and got the \"vegetarian\" option. I also had the watermelon mojito - with real chunks of watermelon and mint! They have GREAT gluten free appetizers as well! 

This is my new favorite restaurant, and although pretty pricey, it's a great date restaurant, or a good girlfriend date. Especially for celiacs, vegetarians, or organic junkies. 

A must visit!"}
{"text":"Well, let me just say I really love this food, but now when I have to wait 45 minutes for it. Their \"pasta machine\" broke. GREAT."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to this establishment at least twice a month and its our favorite restaurant. We ask to sit in Taylor's section every time. Not only is she the best server I've come across but the entire staff is great And makes our experience all the better. I wish they would bring back their salon pea pasta but all their food is amazing. Favorite restaurant and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food and good service. Glad they are in the neighborhood. We are gluten-free household and their creative menu and food quality is great."}
{"text":"Went here with a girlfriend today.  I am gluten-free, she isn't.

I had the eggplant parm and a salad (all gluten free).  My friend had a slice of pizza and tomato basil soup.  Both of our lunches were served with a slice of gluten free bread.  My friend loved the bread and said she didn't taste anything different.  Their gluten free bread is so much better then any sold in stores.

My eggplant parm and salad were sooooo good.  I love this place.

Our server, Ashley, was very good.

I have also had their gluten free fig and gorgonzola pizza.  That is so good also."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to Picazzo's and we were very impressed this time around. The first visit our waitress forgot about us and I had to go in and ask the host for our bill. But the food was so good we had to come back for a second try. This time the food was still great and Nick did a great job waiting on us. I can't say anything bad about our visit as everything was perfect! We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"My sister has a gluton allergy and claims she has never had an issue here. The service is attentive and friendly. All questions were answered in a kind manner. Server was fun to interact with and the environment was enjoyable to dine in. 
Orders were accurate and hot; quality is fresh and presentation was great.
Ordered two pizzas, \"Nannas Favorite\" and we created our own, both were great and they have a wide selection of pre-mades and toppings.
Had tiramisu for dessert that was delicious. They make it clear what is vegan and gluton substitute on the menu. I would return especially with my vegetarian and gluton free friends. Maybe even sit outside under those full blasting misters"}
{"text":"A normal spot for us because of their great healthy, gluten free choices.  Pizza is the favorite!"}
{"text":"We went to Picazzo's for dinner tonight and had excellent food and great service! Our children must eat gluten free and one also has severe nut allergies, so to be able to walk into a restaurant and tell them they could essentially order anything they wanted, including dessert, was amazing! The pizza was great and the tiramisu was delicious. I think we just found our new go-to restaurant!"}

{"text":"Blah. Waitress. Sucked. Fast service but overall very blah. Half off wine bottle for the night on a saturday was great though. Their saving grace. Wanted bread before the meal, tradition with Italian but was charged for it."}
{"text":"This place is on fire. I came here years ago and to be honest, I was far from impressed. We now frequent this place often and I don't think there is a better organic option out there. The food is always fresh, service is on point and I'm never disappointed. Prices are a little higher than you would expect but that's the result of using organic ingredients. Well worth it. 
Many gluten free options and we can't get enough of their pizza. Great transformation here and it looks to be getting better. Well worth it. 

Update. 
Still awesome!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Picazzo's! My little family came here today for lunch and the staff of guys were so friendly and accommodating to our litttle one. Not only did they humor our little lady by responding to the nearly 100 hellos and goodbyes she gave, but they also gave her a doodlepro toy for her enjoyment. Her meal came out very quickly which helped make the experience run so smoothly. We had pizza combos, which were incredibly fresh and tasty. The portion sizes are also very fair considering the quality of the ingredients. We've been on a mission to find the \"best\" pizza in the valley and Picazzo's blows the competition out of the water! It's nice to know there's an actual establishment that acknowledges food allergies and can cater to all needs. Thank you, Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"Great place for special dietary needs! The waiter I had was very well trained on all the foods and their ingredients!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Newly opened so get here quick before lines start.   The experienced manager , Nick, has hired great people and he will make sure everything is perfect.   The menu has almost too many options.  From pasta to pizza.   Cannot recommend it higher than the best.  Gluten free and much better than the competition.   Try it once and you will be back many times."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love their fresh and fabulous salads and also their pastas. Have not tried the pizza but my husband really enjoys them. The heart healthy salad is one of my favorites. Their teas are also delicious. Always great service and have never been disappointed with the food at this location."}
{"text":"Awesome food. A little on the pricy side, but can't complain because it's organic and safe for my friend with celiac's disease to eat there since it's completely gluten free. We always get the oasta bianca and it is wonderfully delicious.

There was one time that our oasta came out watery and the beard was too dry and hard. After letting our waiter know that it was not up to par, he quickly apologized and sent the olates to the kitchen to get us new dishes. Our waiter was very pleasant and understanding, and the customer service is always great when we go."}
{"text":"Overall good experience and we will be back 

Ambiance/environment: warm, comfortable and inviting. Service staff greeted us as soon as we walked into the door and say us right away. 

Service: we had a great server who was fast, friendly and efficient. 

Food/drink: we enjoyed desserts and drinks and they were wonderful"}
{"text":"My wife and I, plus the occasional part of 4, have been coming here for a few years now.  We like the fact that not only is the food good for you, but also that it's priced right and tastes great!

Something we commented on last night, it so nice to see the same faces over the years.  We often have the same bartenders and wait staff, and they are always pleasant and happy to be there.

Their menu has changed quite a bit over the years.  But we are always open to trying the new stuff as it pops up.  We haven't been let down yet.

Their lunch specials are great for a break in the weekend errand running.  I always get the slice of pizza of the week and a salad.  The trick... never ask what the slice of the week is.  That's what I do and I'm never let down.  Its always awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place but the food was kind of blah. I got a salad that sounded good but tasted boring - there just wasn't enough in it. I basically ate a bowl of expensive kale. Its not fun spending lunch wishing I had tried something else! My friend sent her dish back because it was cold in the middle - the staff was very nice about it but it delayed our lunch waiting for the new hot food to come out. When you're business is focused on Italian foods like pasta you'd think you'd make sure the pasta was heated all the way through. The service was good, and I'd like to give them another chance next time I'm in the area, it just wasn't a great first impression."}
{"text":"Exceptional each and every time I visit. The food is scrumptious and the service is speedy and polite. Made my own GF pizza with Alfredo, fresh mozzarella, basil, thyme/rosemary, and House made turkey meatballs. It's honestly the best creation I've made in a long time. Sooo good you'll forget its GF!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food with top Quality ingredients and love that they offer gluten free options!"}
{"text":"We've been to 3 locations - Sedona, Scottsdale & PV.  The pizza is always good and service is always great.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the overuse of garlic.  I'm not a garlic fan, but if you like it - this is the place for you.  If you are being attacked by a Vampire - head to Picazzo, you are safe here.

Last time we went to the PV location they had Dogfish Head 90 on tap, which is amazing.  Pretty rare to find that on tap anywhere.  Great lunch specials also, I think it's like $7.50 for a slice of pizza, salad and drink - not bad in Scottsdale.  They also do a good job of communicating via email when they have specials.  All the locations are really nicely decorated and very upscale feeling.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town! Great food, comfortable environment and the staff treats you like family. 

Tuesday night half price bottles of wine and happy hour appetizers make for an affordable week-date-night. Organic Italian with vegan and gluten free options so everyone can enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Updated Review......back in AZ for a long weekend and we had to stop in to Picazzo's.  Once again, it did not disappoint.  Fortunately, our favorite server (Dominic) was there and working and again provided great service.  We had the hummus and it was amazing.  The lasagna did not disappoint and the salads were once again amazing.  I had 2 local IPA's there were great.  I highly recommend this place for the great, organic food and the great local draft beer.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Accommodates my allergies and tastes great!! I got the vegan pizza bread and vegan cheese."}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal with my family here, and it was all gluten free! We started with garlic cheese bread and Artichoke/Spinach dip appetizers. Our dinners were all gluten free and DELICIOUS! We had butternut squash, creamy gorgonzola and pesto raviolis. We had the cobbler for desert; which was delicious too! 
We can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"Was surprised to find such a great place tucked away. It is comfortable with dining inside and out. Great selection and lots of  ways to  combine meals. Food flavor and portions are just right. The staff is friendly and calm."}
{"text":"If you've read my other reviews, you know I have a vegan brother that is painfully difficult to go out to eat with - nothing against him, but most restaurants aren't very accommodating. Picazzo's is the exception. They offer so many options for him, but also things for the rest of my family to eat (this is BIG). 

Although this wasn't my first time coming here, I had such a great experience that I just had to rave. Our server was so awesome! So sweet and on top of it. For drinks I ordered the Moscow Mule - pretty good, not very strong. For an appetizer we ordered the hummus platter (made vegan). I ordered the creamy tomato bolognese for my entree. This is a new dish to the menu but I would have to give it a 10/10. It was delicious and definitely hit the spot. The thing that amazes me most about Picazzo's is the fact they can cater to the needs of basically any diet (gluten free, dairy free, vegan, veg) BUT their food is good for people that don't have any restrictions at all! Definitely come here. Fresh, tasty, and always on point!"}
{"text":"Picazzo's is a solid restaurant with its healthy food offerings, friendly staff and attentive service. It's just not for me.

I wish it was, but I'm at a point in my life where the threat of pesticide cancer and gluten-free foods mean dick.

The way I see it, if I haven't gotten cancer yet after all the unwashed fruit I've eaten, or karma cancer from anyone I may have fucked-over, well, eating organic stuff isn't going to do anything except make me wonder why the fuck I'm eating organic shit in the first place.

I will however give them props on their turkey sausage and pepper entree.
It was pretty decent but again, the thought of sacrificing pork sausage for turkey, especially when I know I'm probably going to die in a hail of bullets and not cancer, holds little or no comfort for me.

Anyways, if you're into this sort of thing, try Picazzo's  Organic."}
{"text":"This place is great! Having celiac's is a struggle sometimes, especially when your favorite foods all contain gluten. Everything on the menu is gluten free, it sounds too good to be true, but trust me it is wonderful. They have items such as the pizza that are made in a separate part of the kitchen that contain gluten for those family and friends that aren't up for gluten free. They have a full bar with beer, wine, etc, and of course gluten free beers as well. 
I had the cheese ravioli, something I haven't been able to eat for years, and it was better than I could've ever expected. You almost feel guilty for eating it! The server I had was great, attentive and funny! It was my first visit and I felt there had to be a catch, I asked him which items were gluten free and he started pointing at everything on the menu. I wish I would've gotten his name, I was just too mesmerized by all of the options. Our food came out quickly and everything was to die for. All hope is not lost for us celiac's!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious pizza here with my husband tonight....tried a half and half of BBQ chicken and vegetarian on a whole grain thick base. We really enjoyed it. We were also happy to find out that they are now an organic restaurant.  We thought they were a new restaurant as we had never been there before but apparently they have been at this location for quite a few years now and just changed their name and ingredients. Their salads and pastas also look very tasty and for a decent price. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I am always happy to hear of Organic Restaurants. I can say we were very disappointed. It was a Monday eve we sat on the cute little patio as the weather was nice. Within a few minutes the busboy was clearing the cushions off the patio furniture and windows were being cleaned. We felt they wanted to close and we felt we were an inconvenience.
The Butternut Ravioli w Vegetables arrived cold and was in a sauce resembling  milk and the\" vegetables\" were just a few quartered artichoke heart's, the garlic was overpowering and I do like garlic.This tasted  like it wasnt cooked enough and made a strong bitter taste .
My daughters cold Ravioli Carbonara was mediocre and the bed of spinach it was on was also over garliced. 
The Medium sized 6 piece Vortex Pizza was not bad but at the price of 21.50 we expected much more of a Wow factor. I realize organic food costs a bit more but this was crazy over priced food that well,,,tastewise could have been in the ballpark of an Olive Garden or Rigatoni's. 
The bill total for 4 people actually came to the same price we payed at Fine Italian Restaurant Tutti Santi that included Dessert.
 I was going to bring an out of town guest next week if we enjoyed the food but will definitely go to the High End Italian place.. The only thing I enjoyed here was the Lavender Limonade Cocktail . 
I never mind paying more for my dinner but expect to leave with a smile and a satisfied palate"}
{"text":"I actually liked the food a lot however when I decided to take my wife there tonight, they decided to be closed, almost an hour early, and for that they receive an epic fail"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but for a restaurant catered towards gluten free clients I would have hoped the pasta was better. We ordered a pizza, chicken parm and tiramisu. The pizza was the best out of the 3 items. I thought the crust was of good quality and the toppings were fresh. I did not care for the chicken parm. The noodles were gummy, the breaded chicken wasn't very flavorful, and the marinara was dull. The tiramisu was okay, but it definitely made my mouth a little dry - like some gluten free products do. I probably won't be back, but it's nice to have an option for people with celiacs. I think I would have been happier had the noodles not been gummy. Please use a different type of noodles, that would help make the pasta dishes better."}
{"text":"I really want to be able to give this place five stars. Unfortunately, they need to step up their service for that to happen. We waited at least 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. The food took a long time to come out and when it did it was warm at best. One entree was made with the wrong pasta and one didn't come out until a few minutes after everyone else had been served. The entree I had was flavorful and delicious. Hopefully they can work on improving their service and cook times."}
{"text":"The best vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free restaurant in the Phoenix area!  We love it!  Gluten free bread and pizza dough!  I love Zoe's Chopped Salad!  My husband loves their pasta!  Organic chicken! Great green tea!  
They have a full bar too with TVs!  Great outdoor seating!!
Gotta try it!!!"}
{"text":"asked for salsa on side...waiter said it comes on side. he forgot to mention it is the sauce on the slice. had to give my bfast away. went away hungry"}
{"text":"Italian with a fresh organic twist.  I really liked this place.  Was in town for business and stopped in here with a couple co-workers.  It was a beautiful day, so we decided on outdoor seating.  I started with one of their fresh lemonade options along with the garlic cheese bread to start.  The flat bread was garlic-buttery good with a nice melted cheese on top.  Simple with a nice marina for dipping.  My co-workers split the organic hummus platter and really liked it.  For the main dish, I went full on Italian and opted for the Cheese Cannelloni, which came with a side of fresh vegetables.  I inhaled the cannelloni, and the side of veggies was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection.  Overall a nice place focused on fresh food (with gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options).  When I am back in town, I will stop in again!"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy my meals, but something struck me strange this visit as I noticed the entire menu is gluten-free. Here's the deal: I need to eat gluten-free food, but everyone in the world does not. The reality is, gluten-free pasta does not taste as good as regular pasta. I know; there was a time I ate it and I miss it. Yes, quinoa itself, not as a noodle, is a tasty grain. Corn as itself, not as a noodle, is tasty, so why is everyone in the world now being subject to gluten-free pastas? I had the eggplant parmesan which was not anything to write home about. I always love their Greek salad. Am I missing a point as to why gluten-free?"}
{"text":"The food was great as always! This is a great spot for people with dietary restrictions and allergies. Love that I can come here and order vegan and gluten free with confidence."}
{"text":"It's been 7 years since my review for this restaurant. Time really does fly!

I wanted a healthy bite to eat for lunch so I stopped by Picazzo's and tried their new Buddha quinoa bowl. It is a salad/grain bowl with ingredients such as spinach, arugula, rainbow quinoa, avocado, roasted sweet potatoes, slivered almonds, shrimp, and coated with a cumin vinaigrette. That's quite a lot going on in a salad! I requested it with no feta. 

The bowl came out and looked amazing. The colors and overall look was bright and fresh, and the bowl came with a slice of delightful focaccia bread. I think it was gluten free too. 

Overall I enjoyed the different textures and flavors of the vegetables with the quinoa. The sweet potato was for the most part sweet and roasted, although there were a couple pieces that were more \"al dente\" and a little less cooked. The shrimp in the bowl were plentiful and well cooked but were too aggressively seasoned for my tastes. I also thought the cumin flavor was too assertive in the vinaigrette and tended to overpower the rest of the flavors in the bowl. I'd either use a different spice or use less cumin in the dressing if I were to make this bowl on my own. Most of the greens were fresh, but I did pick out a yellow spinach leaf out of my salad portion of the meal.

Service was friendly and swift. It was a warm sunny day so I indulged in the spacious patio outside while eating my lunch.

Even after 7 years Picazzo's is still a pretty good place to eat! Stop by for some organic fresh meals.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed eating at Picazzo's several times.  Last Saturday we went in and were welcomed,seated,ordered and served in a timely and courteous manner. We had the Puttanesca pizza and it was tasty; nice crust and not \"loaded\" with too much stuff on top (really just the right amount).  This was a no-meat pizza, but who knew it could be so good? We tried three different salads, the standard Caesar and a couple of salads that you could upgrade for a couple of dollars. All was delicious and we left very satisfied with our experience, as usual.
Our waiter kept our iced tea glasses full on this hot day!"}
{"text":"Michelle was my waitress and she is awesome.   I sat outside and couldn't decide what to order.  She was patient and so knowledgable about the menu.  I am gluten free and also like to eat the freshest food I can find.  Not only was my waitress amazing, but the food was DELICIOUS.   The menu offers such great choices and I was BLOWN AWAY by how yummy the food is.  I have had gluten free pizza many times but this was by far the best!  My salad was great and I indulged in the apple crisp with coconut ice-cream for dessert.   If you are in the area, like healthy food and want to try something new, GO!!  You will be glad you did.  Then ask for Michelle to be your server.  She is great."}
{"text":"My now fiance' and I have been eating here for years and are never dissapointed. We have eaten here over 10 times and have never had a bad meal or experience. The whole dining area is always clean with a wonderful wait staff. I made a phone call today to ask about wedding catering and spoke with a very kind gentleman named Zaine. He took the time to talk to his manager and made sure that all of my questions were answered. I appreciate how professional and nice he was. We will be having Picazzo's cater our wedding."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Arizona to visit some extended family and one of the nights we were there we ordered from this restaurant. Nice restaurant, we liked the atmosphere but didn't eat there. We ordered 7 dishes mostly pastas and 1 pizza. We liked that the menu identifies the vegan options and we really enjoyed most of our food especially the pizza. The food got about 4 stars for me because of \"most\" of us liking it not all. But what took it to a 5 was the customer service. The cashier/ hostess was extremely helpful and answered all of our questions, we also asked for samples of the sauces that go on the pastas and she gladly got them for us. She was awesome but i don't remember her name. She made sure our order was perfect and fully vegan by making substitutions on some of the order."}
{"text":"Awesome Gluten Free dishes in a great setting. I had the Bianco and my son had the chicken Parmesan and both were outstanding. This restaurant is  a godsend for Celiac Community!"}
{"text":"I went here twice while on vacation in the Phoenix area.  It's awesome that they have so many gluten-free options (I think everything on the menu is gluten-free, except a gluten-filled pizza option).  I was so excited to see a gluten-free bread basket but the bread was really disappointing.  I had to cover it in oil and butter and salt to make it taste decent.  I have had some decent gluten-free bread (like Against the Grain baguette) so I know it's possible!  

They did handle allergies very well though, and their gluten-free pizza was good!"}
{"text":"The service here is always awful but the food is pretty good.  Today that changed when I was fed a pizza with glass in it.  Not only was this handled incompetently by both our server and manager but they didn't even comp our fucking meal.  I'll be calling the health departmStay away at all costs

Edit: this customer service rep is lying.  The party was of 5, not 8.  A pizza was not remade.  The bill was much less, and the extremely incompetent manager admitted that it was a piece of glass, he said it several times that it was \"just\" a \"piece of glass\" from a portion bowl.  Additionally every staff member from waiter to manager handled the situation poorly making sure above all else that we knew it wasn't their personal fault and that \"these things happen\".  Glass in food is not something that just happens.

{"text":"All I can say is I'm thankful that there is a healthy and delicious restaurant on the west side of town.
Not only is the food amazing our server Anthony was attentive and had a super nice personality. He asked if we wanted drinks to go. I'll be back....."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend who is celiac, she was really excited to have another place to go to with a large selection of gluten free options. First glance at the menu, wow these prices are high, which I understand because they are catering to the organic, free range chemical free crowd, which I have no problem with but it had better be top quality for that price point. 

This location is new and looks nice, I like the Edison bulbs giving a soft yellow glow that you don't see in our CFL world. The space is tight and I felt like I was contributing to the conversation being had by the couple next to me.

On the the service. Not impressed. we were seated and had our waters quickly but my glass was never refilled, we were not checked on and the manger delivered our food because our waitress was nowhere to be seen. There were only a few people there and no one seemed too busy. On the plus side the kitchen seems to have their stuff together because our food was brought out quickly.

The food was okay, we ordered gluten free garlic cheese bread, it was a rice based bread and was served with olive oil. While it wasn't bad, there where no flavors that really popped out. For our dinner we had the Pepperoni, Sausage and Ricotta pizza. The crust on this pizza was great but again no flavors really stood out to me. 

Overall I would try this place again, getting something other than the pizza just to give it a fair shake. I score one star for the atmosphere and one star for the food. Picazzo's looses three start due to the lack of service and the price for the quality."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  I had the lunch combo with salad, drink and lasagna.  The salad was good (strawberries spinach balsamic walnuts).  The lasagna was mostly cheese and sauce.  It wasn't really lasagna.  They have a lot of gluten free options if you have allergies.  My group enjoyed their meals (curry pastas)  and desserts.  I missed out on dessert."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but my experience calls for one. I ordered a Togo order and it was all messed up! I understand people make mistakes, which is why I immediately called and asked for a manager. I was placed on hold then after a while of waiting, it was almost as if someone answered and hung up. So I assumed it was a mistake, so I called back again, same person answered, placed me on hold and boom.. answer and hung up. Needless to say I won't be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a restaurant with an extensive Vegan menu. Today, I tried the lunch combo of the GF Vegan pizza and Ko's Chopped Salad (with the Vegan options). So delicious! I would recommend Picazzo's to both Vegans and non-Vegans, alike. Just good food!"}
{"text":"I would love to put this place at 5 stars because my food was fantastic (couldn't even tell it was gluten free either!) and my waiter was nice but it took 45 minutes to an hour to get our food! That's definitely not acceptable... Luckily there were 8 of us and I ordered a bottle of wine so we had a way to entertain ourselves for an hour. 

Let's get to what I liked though. I ordered the pulled pork ragu with butternut squash ravioli... It was fantastic. Pasta was fresh and the ragu was light. I finished my whole plate."}
{"text":"Great gluten free menu! Good selection of wine and beer. My wife and I eat here regularly."}
{"text":"Take two nonmeat eaters. Then give one of them Celiac's and a dairy allergy. Now add a love for pizza. 

Picazzos meets our dietary needs in every way. Love them for this. However, even for someone who is used to eating out at organic restaurants, it is SUPER pricey. Over $30 before tip for one pizza? *sigh* If only my wallet loved it as much as my tummy.

Nevertheless, I will still return for those \"treat yourself\" days :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a New and Delicious location to have amazing tasting pizza and a great salad, this is it!  We had the berrylicious salad - great taste.  We ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza. Great flavor and taste. Service is amazing and the servers are friendly. Parking is good and location is great."}
{"text":"I went here the last time I was in Phoenix and it really wasn't that great.  The gluten free pizza crust was fantastic, but that was the only fantastic thing about the place.  I had the gluten free pizza with figs and balsamic, but the figs were dried figs so they were far too sweet.  Also, the bathroom sink was full of mildew, which I find bizarre.  Just have a bottle of water and bleach mixture and spray it on the inside of the sink - there is no reason for mildew.  To top off our experience, out waitress was constantly MIA, and didn't bring us utensils.  

This place has a lot of potential to be great though, and I will probably try to go back for the gluten free pasta, just to try it."}
{"text":"Two items we ordered came out wrong and the food was average at best. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Very good for any special diets! If you're vegan and gluten-free, you're out of luck on the pizzas. But have no fear! There are options for everyone - even those \"Regular\" people!

The gluten-free crust is not vegan (egg) but I am only vegetarian for the moment. It was better than I thought a gf crust would be. The candied walnuts were shockingly good on pizza and I highly recommend trying it with any combination!

I will be going again... and maybe again! and again!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I got the chicken parm and substituted my pasta for zoodles, best zoodles I ever had too!"}
{"text":"Picazzo's has undergone a name change and new menu, but mot things are the same...they're just touting their organic and local qualities. Their \"puttanesca\" pizza (artichokes, olives, feta, tomato) is outstanding, though has nothing to do with puttanesca which is tomatoes, olives, capers and anchovies. their special tropical tea is flat and dull, but serving Santa Cruz sodas is inspired!"}
{"text":"Great wood fire pizza. I had the organic salad and Baja Shrimp Pizza. It was fantastic they even have gluten free dough. Apple crisp with Madagascar Vanilla ice cream was a perfect ending service was good and server was friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered two chicken piccata orders to go. One with Zoodles, one regular. Both orders combined had less than 4oz of chicken. The zoodles were delicious. The pasta was way under cooked and very pasty. They refunded that order. For $17 per order we certainly expected more.  
I have decided to update my review because the owner called me and apologized and that went a long way with me.  Since that time everything was better. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I went here and it was STILL disappointing. Ordered spinach artichoke dip which was lacking in flavor.  The pizza crust is soggy, the toppings are sparce and the service was terrible again. And it's not cheap! Definitely don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Very cozy and comfortable restaurant! Service is also great and the food is phenomenal! Would encourage anyone to try it!"}
{"text":"Definitely bummed ... It seems as if the prices are going up but the quality is going down ! The only reason it got 3 stars instead of 2 is because I love the gluten free variety ! 

However this last visit the salad had chicken that both my mom and I thought tasted and looked like the pre-cooked cut chicken from the deli isle at grocery stores ... For the price it should not be that way !! 

And their portion sizes also aren't the greatest ... Don't come here without a coupon !"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I travel the globe in search of great gluten free cuisine - and Picazzo gets two enthusiastic thumbs up.  Everything we tried was fresh, healthy, and delicious.  Many restaurants that are entirely gluten free have a limited menu.  Picazzo's menu is so varied we had to go back everyday for four days, and we still didn't have a chance to order everything we wanted to try.  Thai curry with homemade fusilli and fresh basil is gorgeous, as is the skillet chocolate chip cookie.  GF pizza, homemade GF pasta, and the entire dessert menu: all outstanding.  Lots of dairy-free/vegan options as well."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT restaurant & bar, 1st Class & Elegant yet relaxed environment. The Supervisor -- named Kale, very fitting for an organic & health focused cafe -- was also 1st Class, obviously highly competent & passionate about his work, with an impeccable first impression, which continued for the rest of my visit. ... The Italian White Bean & Kale soup was delicious, as was the Hummus Platter. Both with great focaccia bread. Nice draft beer selection, too. There are a KOT of items in the menu, with a wide variety of interesting options. ... They are very accommodating as to dietary restrictions as well. ... The decor is beautiful yet unpretentious, and inviting with warm colors and lots of windows. ... This and their other restaurants are the Original Creation of the equally impeccable owner, Rick F. I was a frequent customer of his in the original Picazzo's in Sedona, when I lived there over a decade ago. ... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again a few days ago.  Really enjoyed seeing so many new options.  The veggie pasta was very good coupled with a side salad my friend mentioned. The pizza we ordered sadly was very undercooked and was soaked with oil.  Not crunchy and cold.  The kale and quinoa with steamed veggie dish had no taste and was very tiny for the price.  Not sure if they were having a bad day but the food was not up to par and came hungry and left hungry.  the amount of food except for the pizza is very small.  We might try the one on cactus as the one on FLW has disappointed us before.  I would like to give them more stars as love their menu but so far they have not been able to deliver on the quality of food very poor tasting I have encountered my friends well they like everything!!!"}
{"text":"Came in to try a new spot out, made a mistake going here. Walked in and the hostess was on the phone for at least three minutes before acknowledging us. Sat us outside and it took another 10 minutes or so to be served. Then when it came time or order pizza, the waiter informed us the pizza oven is backed up and it would take a long time for the order to get out. 

Really bad experience here. It's pretty obvious it's a new restaurant and poorly managed."}
{"text":"Puttanesco pizza (artichokes) was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient.. They even have gluten free pizza crust. Happy hr drink is 1.00 off all drink choices which I love since I can order whatever I like"}
{"text":"New location for a great restaurant where everything on the menu is gluten free (except for a couple of the pizza crusts) and most things are vegetarian or can be made vegetarian/vegan. Glad to see so many options for good fresh food that is allergy friendly.  Great happy hour prices on appetizers. Very fresh tasting food and good service."}
{"text":"After eating here two times, I found it to be just, meh. 

The gluten free original pizza dough tasted like it was made from a cross between biscut and corn bread. It fell apart when you picked it up.

The cheese bread lacked any sort of flavor unless you dipped it into olive oil and pepper.

Hot artichoke spinach dip isn't as good as CPK's.

The Chicken Picatta and Chicken Parmesan are pretty good.

Their website reminds me of back in the 90's when we were on dial-up.   S  o    s  l  o  w.

I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well, if you're into that, you'll love this joint!!!

The food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage, which at any other place is a very small pizza, and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).  

Don't be fooled by this \"gourmet\" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.

when I compare this to say Oreganos, they are not even in the same ball league.

{"text":"Me and my daughter (toddler) went here yesterday for lunch, another friend of mine came. We waited for someone to approach for about 5-10mins. No one came. So I went to the Juice Bar and asked the lady if we could just find our own table. She said, oh no , Ill take you and apologized. So we sat down, I had to ask for the kids menu, and a high chair..obviously, if you're  going to seat us and you see that there's a toddler, you're supposed to automatically assume that we need a kids menu and highchair or booster or at least ask if we need one. So she came back w the kids menu and highchair, the kids menu at most restaurants consist of a coloring paper and a set of crayons. So yes it was a coloring paper/menu..but no crayons, so I asked the server we didnt get a crayon. she said , oh no we dont have any...i said oh u ran out of crayons? and she said, no we dont give out crayons...  i was like , huh? OKAY... so my daughter who's 2 yr old got the coloring paper but no crayon good thing she didnt throw a fit, she just kept saying color color color.... so I just handed her my smart phone so she can play and keep her busy before she screams.... 
Ugh... that right there was a sign that we should have left and not order... but i was craving for some chicken wings... and we were hungry..we ordered chicken wings, and 2 entrees . was hoping the customer service will get better, but no! The server didnt come back to refill my empty glass of water and my friend had to call the server to ask for refill on his green tea.  The server came finally to offer if we wanted dessert... and became nice and all smiley towards the end, of course, because thats when she handed the tab... Well she still got a decent amount of tip because thats just how we are. But I just hope that they improve their customer service skills. Its a healthy restaurant, therefore, the people that work there must show some positiveness and encouragement with a smile.. :) that is all i wanted to share. I hope that whoever reads this, if you are the management, please address this to your employees. 

Thank you."}
{"text":"I've always loved going to all the Picazzo's in town! Always delicious food and good service, I feel lucky to have a gluten free restaurant to go to that I don't have to pick out things from the menu I have to stay away from. Best part is, all my friends and family that don't have celiac disease love it as well!"}
{"text":"I like this place, close to where I live GF, Organic - - two of my favorite things.  I do miss my pizza and bagels (Gluten free now) so it's nice to have pretty close to normal pizza - - i haven't tried the pasta yet.  I actually wasn't that impressed w/ the salads, but I am super picky when it comes to them - they need to be filling (I think there were like two bites of protein in the one i ordered), and they can't have a speck of red on the ends.  Being GF and Dairy free Italian is a food area i've had a hard time eating at, so this is a nice change to go back to my old roots and be able to digest it."}
{"text":"Pizza is AMAZING!!! Food is so fresh and not greasy or fatty. Lots of vegan and gluten free options which is so amazing. The pasta is so amazing too, and you can also get Zoodles which is a great healthier option. Service was great, restaurant is so cute!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free options .. Some favorites are pear Gorgonzola salad and create your own gluten free pizza, or lasagna"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch the other day  
Service was good in the beginning and then just went nonexistent 

We had at least 4 different servers taking care of us, by taking care I mean filling our water cups every 5 minutes, even when our glasses were still full... As far as the location, this particular seems to have a ton of regulars, which is cool... But each and every server/bartender was carrying on loud conversations with their regulars to be heard by everyone in the restaurant... 

We ordered the Duncan Farms Organic salad and it was a good size for two people but it was very bland...
The greens were not my favorite and the dressing was just as plain... 

Our pizza took about 20-30 minutes to arrive and once it did, it was a bit small... 
We chose the Naples Margherita 
The medium pizza was devoured in less than 7 minutes... 
I did like the pizza as it had good flavor and tasted \"healthy\" and organic... I also didn't agree with the size/price for it though...

I was still hungry while we left the restaurant... I would like to give Picazzo's a nothing try in the future..."}
{"text":"Lovely space, friendly staff...I ordered the chipotle pasta dish and didn't love it for the price"}
{"text":"We have our daughter on a gluten-free diet and then needed to also switch to dairy free.  She loves the pizza at Picazzo's.   We've ordered take out from here many times since moving to Scottsdale in March 2016.  We have also dined in a couple of times.  
All in all we have experienced very good service and the food is great.  Once we switched to the dairy-free cheese our daughter commented that the cheese seemed different but she still liked it. We didn't tell her it was vegan cheese.  
We have tried and recommend the pasta and the Thai peanut quinoa dish."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!! Food is consistently great and Nick the general manager makes every visit very special. This is the best restaurant on the west side!! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and forgot to write a review after our first visit.  The second time was even better.  The food, service, staff...everything was fantastic.  Happy hour offers great deals on food and drinks 7 days a week...It's not very common finding a quality happy hour Sat-Sun!
The Gluten-Free bread is available to purchase by the loaf as well.  Even if you're not specifically into healthy eating, I'm confident you'll find some satisfying dishes that are packed with exceptional flavor."}
{"text":"What a find! I only wish we had one where I live. We shared 2 appetizers which ended being enough for a meal- generous  portions. We had avocado toast w arugula salad and spinach artichoke dip. Lots of veggies and wonderful. We were so full we skipped right to dessert - apple crisp w coconut ice cream. Go for the coconut ice cream- really enhances the dessert. Apple crisp portion was again shareable and generous. Our server Shauna was so nice and helpful. Love you girl! We'll be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and is great for people with food allergies. They have a dedicated gluten free stone oven just for the pizzas so you know you will be taken care of. I will definitely be coming back here!

{"text":"My daughter and I came here for dinner last night because of a Groupon, and we were not disappointed. We ordered the build your own 16-inch organic pizza with extra mozzarella and half of the Zo's chopped salad. The sauce and the cheese on the pizza were so delicious--very high quality, fresh-tasting with lots of flavor. The salad was also excellent. My daughter loved everything. The only thing I didn't love was the crust on the pizza. It was perfectly fine, and my daughter liked its crunchiness, but I prefer my crust a little chewier (we didn't order the gluten-free or I would totally understand the lack of chewiness). Service was also very good.

Yes, their prices are a bit higher than your average pizza place. The total for our dinner was $30.50 (before tax and tip), and we were STUFFED with leftovers. People, organic, vegan, and gluten-free ingredients are EXPENSIVE!! I know this because my husband is gluten-free and I try to buy organic for my kids. It's so much more expensive than regular, cheaper ingredients. I could tell that what they use at Picazzo's is high-quality, excellent stuff. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"It's a little on the pricey side but you can be assured that your meal is free of gluten and that's worth a lot in my book!  The owner of this establishment works well with the GF community to ensure his staff is trained in cross contamination.  The other thing that's great about Picazzo's is that almost everything on the menu can be made gluten free.

I always get the Diavolo pizza gluten free, GF of course!  The pizza is covered with caramelized onions, red and yellow peppers.It also includes the most amazing andouille sausage and pepperoni.  I have never had a bad one!

Their appetizers are good as well.  I can get great salads, cheese bread and hummus with pita that I can actually eat!  Life is good!  They even have a selection of GF desserts.  What's not to love?  This location always has pretty good service and consistently good food.  It's so nice to go out and not have to worry or explain your dietary restrictions!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza.  I love Pasta.  I love these two foods more than any other food on earth.  Seriously.  You can imagine the first thoughts going through my head finding out that my two favorite foods I LOVE would be off limits.  Ugh............the travesty!  Oh, the injustice!

Then I began searching for places which carried GF pizza crust.  I knew it was out there.  It didn't sound very appetizing, but it's all I can have, so I searched for all the reviews.  I read and researched every one I could find.  I was pretty sure that out of all of the competition one stood head and shoulders above the rest.

Was I right?  Well, I won't know for a while due to the fact that it's the first GF Pizza I've tried.  I seriously doubt that any other GF Pizza will ever top it though.  Oh, yeah it is THAT GOOD!  Quite honestly, it's one of the better Pizza's I've ever had!  GF or NOT.

Where is this place?  Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen: Tempe, AZ.  They have six Arizona locations but this one was inviting, clean (bathrooms spotless), service spectacular and food was delectable.  This place understands GF issues and you feel perfectly fine ordering from them.  They have separate ovens and preparation areas for all GF foods, and so many eating options for the entire family, GF or not.

We started with the GF Organic Garlic Cheese Bread.  Such a great start!  It is served with Olive Oil with a few very tasty olives in it.  It could have been a little more \"garlicky\" for me but it was still extremely good.  Light and airy with a terrific amount of Cheese on it.  It didn't last long on anyone's plate.

I had the Diavalo Specialty Gourmet Pizza.  The GF comes only in Medium size.  The crust is quit thin but very tasty.  It consists of an Organic tomato sauce, with mozzarella, pepperoni, red and yellow bell peppers, caramelized onions, andouille sausage and red pepper flakes (I did LESS Diavolo and omitted the red pepper flakes!)  The sausage still had a little kick to it but not overpowering.  Divine; pure and simple.

The Hubs had the Pepperoni, Sausage and Ricotta on Picazzo's Original Crust (not GF) and was extremely happy with his choice.  The Mother in Law ordered a Half order Natural Chopped Italian Salad Which had so much meat in it she was shocked!  Pepperoni, smoked ham, and salami.  It also lettuce,  garbanzo beans, organic tomatoes, a significant amount of fresh mozarella, black olives, pepperoncini, Parmesan, GF croutons and Italian Dressing.  Completely GF, huge for a half order and looked amazingly fresh! The child was quite happy with a small cheese pizza!

We then finished the meal with a few desserts.  Yes, GF too! I brought most of mine home.  A skillet Brownie.  It's about 6 inches around with non dairy organic ice cream and organic chocolate sauce!  Joy and Bliss rolled into one! 

This will be a \"Go To\" place for sure.  Probably only for The Hubs and me, due to the pricing, but what a date night!  I can have Pizza!  It's a little \"Pizza Heaven on Earth!\""}
{"text":"All the Picazzo's are great.  This one is no exception.  I can get quality, organic, GLUTEN FREE food where they understand cross contamination and I can eat without worry of getting sick.  The Happy Hour is fantastic with half price \"small plates\" which include yummy Turkey Meatballs in a wonderful sauce, garlicy cheesy bread and yummy chicken drums and wings.

The pizza is the best GF pizza I have ever had and the Chicken Parm (I sub out all alfredo sauce) is the icing on the cake.  Everything I have eaten is good.  Salads are HUGE.  The only thing I personally dislike is the roasted veggies that come with the entrees....but I am not a brussel sprouts fan."}
{"text":"Albeit a bit pricy, the artisan pizzas are the best I've found in Phoenix, which means I'm adding it to the best of Tempe list.  The restaurant has a trendy feel inside and some outdoor seating on a nice patio that faces the parking lot outside.  The only problem is that Picazzo's dropped my favorite pizza.  They went on an organic only binge and a hunt for locally produced ingredients and bye bye to the chipotle barbacoa.  Can I get a moment of silence for the chipotle barbacoa, a spicy pizza with hunks of seasoned beef?  And favorite number two has entered the witness protection program as the menu lists it under a different alias every time I visit.  It was originally called \"That's Italian,\" but now I just order the one with peperoni and salami.  Picazzo's is always running a lot of specials and has a happy hour.  Every week there is special, and they liked to do themes.  During tax season there was some kind of deal where large pizzas cost $10.40.  Oh, the irony.  So get on the mailing list if you like deals.

The bathroom is nice, clean, and worth mentioning in a review.

Unless you have actually tried Picazzo's, I don't even want to hear about how your favorite pizza place it better.  Because it isn't."}
{"text":"Really great.  All gluten free (except the beer) I think.  Happy hour was 50% off all apps and dollar off drinks entire restaurant not just the bar.  Meat balls with artichokes and the wings were great.  Caprese salad was great.  A few vegan options too.  I'm a meat eater with a gf wife so awesome place for me!"}
{"text":"This organic restaurant used to have beautiful salads. Now just cheapy salads with minimal ingredients at the same high price. Not worth it anymore for salads. I can't speak to the other food which we normally love, pasta and pizza. I wish their owners would bring back the gourmet salads!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!! Can not believe that it was all gluten free. Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Full bar, thank you sweet baby Jesus for the bloody Mary's I needed them so much today  Huge menu, lots of vegan/ vegetarian options. The west side desperately needs something like this. Our bartender/ server was super nice and personable, and the food was great!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES. I was SO happy to discover conscious, healthy, REAL food on the West side. I'm a vegetarian and my mom is gluten-intolerant, so we have a hard time finding restaurants with a decent selection. We went to Picazzo's for lunch today and they exceeded all expectations. 

We walked into the beautifully decorated restaurant, and were promptly greeted by their super friendly staff. We sat out on the patio which was real cute and comfy. 

I ordered spinach ricotta cannelloni with white bean soup and my mom ordered bianca w/ bigoli and zo's chopped salad. Everything was SO DELICIOUS. We were probably being annoying as hell because we couldn't stop saying YUM, Mmmmmm, and OMG yusss. Next we shared the tiramisu, and it. Was. So. Good. AND it was gluten free! WOW. yes. mmm.

I was shocked that they had both vegetarian AND gluten free dishes that were not only absolutely delicious, but also made with responsible, non-GMO ingredients AND for a good price. The lunch special came with your entree, soup/salad, and drink for like $13.

I'm so impressed by this place. It is by far the most sustainable restaurant i've found in this area, the ONLY thing I didn't like was that they use plastic straws (but this is obviously if I'm being super nit-picky). 

Picazzo's is what all restaurants should strive to be."}
{"text":"Food and service is great, its the price of the food, a small pizza with 2 toppings is $18.50...wow,  Just seems like the cost for what you get here is on the higher end even for Scottdale"}
{"text":"We recently have gone to picazzos and have eaten there many times. we purchase the salads and occasionally the pizza  and a appetizer. This time around we ordered wings, pasta and a few pizzas. we were so very much displeased in the meal as we had to throw it out when we boxed it up after not taking a bite of it. It looked like somebody threw up on the plate and served it to you. I assure you, if you can open up a can of spaghetti o's than you would be better off. The wings were terrible and no sauce, luke warm and the meatballs are frozen and not fresh with moldy hard cheese. The thai chicken pizza was a joke and for 30 bucks for something you can get for 15 somewhere else, its just a disappointment. I told the manager and he blew me off and told me to send in pictures of the meal that I was not happy about. who takes pictures of their food after ordering it and not liking it. I somehow knew he would ask me for that and sent them to him, totally busted right. well he came back and told me pretty much tough luck and don't come back. so Please take my advise and don't eat here. You can easily have a better meal at maggianos around the corner, get a steak at capital grill for the same price or other establishments near by. I promise you, you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I cannot complain about service and quality of food, 1 major problem was there was no paper in the bathroom. I will still give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I frequent this place for lunch and dinner. It's become my go to place when eating out and looking for great and healthy food. They added some new items to the menu and I just had the Tuscan Chicken Breast for dinner. Wow!  Healthy and full of flavor. The side dish of broccoli and cauliflower was so good too. I can't say enough good things about this place.  So happy when the manager Sean is working and Nick is behind the bar.  This is my \"Cheers\".   They are so nice and treat everyone like family"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the apple gorgonzola salad and the apple cobbler crisp with coconut ice cream. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went to Picazzo's on a Monday night. It wasn't busy, so we were seated right away. The table service was pretty slow, though. I felt bad for the table behind me, where the lady had ordered a salad, but received something entirely different. Then, when they went to check out, the server got their bill incorrect.  I felt even worse for the couple at the table across from us who, having specifically told the server about a coconut allergy (they ask when they take your order), were served something that was made with coconut oil. They had to jet quickly to get to his EpiPen (understandably), but weren't even comp'd for the meal. Not my first visit here, but it will be my last. They should take the \"allergy friendly\" advertisement off of the window of the establishment, if they can't train their staff properly. Our food was ok, but  all of the negative things going on around us affected my enjoyment. I just wanted to get out of there.

Update 6/28/18:  Hey Nancy, the lecture was unnecessary. My review was, and is, a serious warning to people with allergies to skip your restaurant, lest the same thing happen to them.  It's not personal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere and top notch service. I know I will not have an allergy issue. Will definitely come here again! Had two orders of wings since they were so good, quinoa salad and the spicy slaw. All a big hit. And you cannot beat the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant made me forget my gluten free/dairy free restrictive diet. The gluten free vegan pizza crust with daiya cheese was absolutely amazing! Kudos to these alternative recipes! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken piccata dish! I haven't tried anything else yet because I keep going to this dish but one day I will try others."}
{"text":"The concept was amazing and the staff was spectacular. However we went for lunch and it was super slow and we ordered a salad. The salad didn't have a lot of dressing and was a little dry. I will go back and try again and hopefully this time we can get it the way we need/want it."}
{"text":"Really good--lasagna is very flavorful. Luke is very fun. A bonus that they have live music on the patio on this Wednesday evening."}
{"text":"What a great place! The Sangria is amazing along with the lasagna. This is but one of their locations and is the newest. Dana is the assistant manager and a good friend of ours. They have a full menu with many delicious options."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great lunch combo selections. Had the Pepperoni pizza slice with the berry-luscious salad. Will be a favorite!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is fresh and amazing. No matter what I have I am happy. When I can't decide, Nick picks an amazing meal for me! I love sitting at the bar,  it's like coming home! No matter if I'm with friends or alone, they treat me like family! 
Favorite dish - butternut squash ravioli with pesto sauce! DELISH!"}
{"text":"I ended up here unplanned as we were driving around the neighborhood with 30 minutes to spare before attending an open house event. Not many places are open at 11:30am on a sunday morning that you can get a quick bite but luckily for us, Picazzo's came to our rescue.

This restaurant wasn't at all what I expected. It turned out the Picazzo's is a super healthy Italian place with lots of salads and an extensive juice bar. I recently got onto the juicing kick and opted for the Green Machine juice. It could have used more apple to sweeten it but it was fresh and delicious.

As I said, we only had 30 minutes so the waitress recommended salads for us. I chose the kale salad and immediately I knew it was going to be a good one. The kale was the darkest kale I have ever seen and super frilly (maybe this is a special type of kale that isn't available at Whole Foods?). The greens were dressed with a lemony dressing and sprinkled with almonds. It was delicious and super good for you. My husband had a cranberry salad which he also enjoyed. You can get kale substituted in any salad free of charge as an investment in your health.

I loved the super healthy selection of food, not that I don't like my greasy deep fried food either. But if you need to get your vegetables in and are craving some extra fiber in your diet, please go to Picazzos."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  One of those \"safe bets\" when it comes to pizza restaurants.  Nothing really out of the ordinary, but still much better than any chain.   

Of course it's in a strip mall, hello this is Arizona remember.  Staff was friendly.  Food was good, but it ain't no Cibo!"}
{"text":"Some friends of ours were looking to have pizza at a place that offered a gluten-free option.  A quick search on Yelp revealed Picazzo's and we were off and running.

I'll get to the brass tax on this one.  The pizza was very good and fresh--no complaints about taste.  The restaurant was cool and had a nice ambiance.  The place was so loud, however, that I had a hard time hearing people talk at my own table.  Service was moderately attentive, but there were times when we were waiting much too long for drink refills--the place was busy, mind you, but the pauses were noticeable.

It comes down to this--do you want to pay $25 for a 14\" pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms?  I usually don't.  I can go to Pizza Slices in Mesa (formerly 99 Cent Pizza Place), and trade in the hipster ambiance for two yummy 18\" pies for $20.  The gluten-free pizzas were apparently quite good, and some of our other guests liked the pasta plates they got.  In this case, if you want the dining experience, options, and atmosphere, Picazzo's will give it to you--you're just going to have to pay a bit more.

Three and a half stars on this one.  Yes, I'd go back, but it would have to be for a special occasion with friends and/or family.  If I've got a pizza jones, this is not the place where I would satisfy it--I want more bang for my buck if I'm looking to chow down on a pie."}
{"text":"Edible... that's how I'll describe this food. I ate it - cleaned my plate even. I had a lunch special which was a half-salad and a slice. The slice was a \"runt\" as the waiter described it and swore most slices were larger - he then brought out a second \"runt\" for half price to make up for the small portion of food. 

It's a very generic place considering how much my girlfriend and friend raved about it. These are usually located in small corner strip malls and the decor is entirely forgettable. I had a good look at their bathroom and i thought it was nice and clean and they provided little shot cups so you could have a bit of mouthwash... classy. 

I should point out that I'm a pizza purist and prefer cheese or pepperoni or sausage or all 3, but not much else... I'm told that this place is great if you like a large variety of toppings. So take my review with that in mind.

I thought the dough was bland and dry and unappealing. Flavorless, but capable of holding up the thin layer of toppings. I imagine they skimp on toppings because you are supposed to order many many toppings. That probably explains why the bread is sturdy. Still, my friend's slice was loaded, but looked sparse as well. 

The cheese was also completely flavorless even though they sprinkled some parm on the top. The pepperonis were okay I guess - I like them thicker and more spicy though. The sauce was flavorless as well... overall a pretty bland and boring pizza experience. It reminded me of Dominos flavor-wise (or lack thereof).

After eating, I was hanging out in the parking lot talking with my friend and my food suddenly hit me and gave me the shits - that's why I got a look at the bathroom. I wouldn't put money on it that it was definitely the pizza that gave me the browns, but it was the only thing I had eaten that day. It's entirely possible it wasn't the food though since I ate a bunch of candy the night before. 

Anyway - everyone's taste in pizza differs... I'm not a fan, but you may be. This place gets a 2.5/5 from me - it's pretty average. More experimental foodies might love it. People who like simple pizza may want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best customer service! I frequent this place because the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and the food is great! Lots of good vibes at this location! I will continue to dine here. See you all soon!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite organic restaurants to eat at. The food and our server Melanie was excellent. Their pizza and pasta dishes are very good. 

I would recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"So this is an update to my last review of the location. My husband and I placed a take out order a month ago and when we opened my order there were just a few Zoodles (Zucchini Noodles) with veggies and sauce. My meal was around $17.99 and so it prompted me to write my last review. I was complimentary about the food but wanted to share my experience.
I received a nice response from Nancy H their customer service representative. She said the next time I was ate there, to mention it to the GM Nick and mention Nancy from a Yelp review requested me to do so. So I did, and then the waitress came back and said she talked to her manager and Nick the GM was not in. She said the manager would try to contact him to see what they could do for me. I never saw the manager and they never mentioned it again. I thought that was very odd. I have to say I was surprised the manager did not come over herself and explain that to me, a bit tacky I thought and it put the server in an awkward position. This is a Tuesday night 7:30 and it's was not busy. So. I'm not sure how I feel about this and feel sorry for Dana B our server who obviously felt awkward too."}
{"text":"I've heard good things but frankly I was not impressed.  Lunch special was an okay  deal, but food was only mediocre. The meatballs had no flavor and had a strange texture.  The lasagna bolognese also lacked flavor other than salty.  Both salads were not tossed well...clumps of dressing on some, none on other parts. Just okay. I won't go back unless a friend really wants to go.  Maybe I should have stuck with the pizza."}
{"text":"Was thoroughly impressed our first time here! All dressings are made in house and are delicious! We tried the baked wings with BBQ Chipotle sauce and buffalo sauce, both were excellent. Their gluten free pizza crust was the best I've tasted in the valley yet and we've tried many GF pizzas... Also recommend the berry salad. Definitely come before 6pm to make happy hour!"}
{"text":"First visit. Atmosphere & noise level could use improvement. The kale, quinoa bowl was pretty good.... a little too heavy on the kale. My husband was very happy with the lasagna. But the best was the free tiramisu... delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the food here .. Great drink .. Great service. Crazy enough though.. The women at the bar love to drink!!!! Lots of smiles tonight!"}
{"text":"You'd think that spending $22 on a medium pizza (it's really a small pizza anywhere else) would make me very unhappy.  However, when it's gluten-free and the toppings are delicious and the dough doesn't taste like a sponge and neither I nor my wife had to make the said pizza, you'd be wrong.  Best gluten-free pizza that wasn't made in my home that I've ever had.  

Still, it is gluten-free and gluten is rather delicious, so I can't get too carried away with my starage."}
{"text":"We have gone here for years. Not one dish has ever disappointed. Everyone over the years has been super friendly and always remember us. Nick at the bar is a rockstar and makes amazing drinks as well"}
{"text":"This place is great. They do an awesome job with gluten free food. We had Allison as a server and she was great. We're so happy we went and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive at first with this restaurant. It's hard to seat five or more here as most tables seat four. As I had been away on orders for the last month I wanted my first drink in a month to be something worthwhile. And alas the the twilight drink with gin was on the weak side. However once seated, the lady was more than happy to bring me three saucers of tasters for the soups! Such hospitality, I was enamored. I had ginger beer and their signature gin. Great choice of soups, buffalo wings and pizza. The food is by far the best a chain can offer. Each individual restaurant might have it's hang ups as far as service but my experience was great. I know my in-laws enjoyed their carbonara. I loved my lentil soup. The gin straight up and dirty was excellent. I'm happy to take home their margarita pizza the best in the business with shredded basil instead of full leaf I believe adds far more flavour. Great bathrooms and layout to boot. I can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"This place is good!! I ordered 2 slices of pizza for lunch and really enjoyed it. The dough was crunchy at first but when you get to the crust it is like a pillow you can eat. haha. I sat in the bar and the bartender was quick with my drinks and was very nice. If you are around the area you should stop by and eat some lunch. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband, our 1 yr old and I just had dinner there. While we were there earlier than most ppl eat dinner, the service was fast and the restaurant was perfect for bringing our son. 
We got a GF pizza which was amazing! The crust wasn't rock hard or grainy- it was hard to tell it was even GF! My half had the daiya cheese & my husband had normal cheese. They made sure the cheeses didn't touch w/o being asked to. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in very quickly for lunch, it has a really nice authentic and modern feel. I ordered pepperoni slices to go, it was very quick about 10 minutes and the girl at the front desk was very friendly! I have never been so she was helpful with the menu while I was trying to figure out what I wanted. I would defiantly like to try it again for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona and came here last night for the first time! Very good food, great environment, many options on the menu, and we had a lot of fun with the bartender Anthony. We had the California pizza with gluten-free crust, and it was delicious. Very flavorful and a very nice surprise that they're generous with the avocado on top! We also had the Heart Healthy salad and it was good too! Fresh tomatoes and candied walnuts; yum Dessert was chocolate cake with coconut ice creamMy first time here, but certainly not my last! I will be back"}
{"text":"I went here and had dinner and the prices were very expensive for what they offered.   The waiter was polite but the portions were small for what they were offering.  31.00 with tip for a child and myself is too high given my son ordered from the kids menu.  The quality of the food was not very good.  I will not be coming back to this place ever."}
{"text":"We created our own vegan pizza which came out really delicious. We were not charged extra for switching out the dairy cheese for non-dairy which I find just mean when restaurants do that and the ingredients were fresh tasting. Sadly we couldn't get the multigrain crust because it wasn't vegan, but the vegan one (we did not get gluten free) was still really good. 

Ordering was a bit of a hassle because our waiter said he'd come back when we were halfway through ordering, because we were taking too long I guess. He went and took someone else's order then walked a way for a bit longer than we would have thought necessary, especially since we had started ordering first. Kind of strange. We had questions and needed to figure out or order based on his answers. Otherwise a good meal."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and it's pretty good and decent vegan options. First time I got the spicy slaw , bean soup and side of veggies and this last time I got vegan BBQ pizza, zucchini noodles and side of veggies. 

The BBQ pizza sauce was amazing !!! Surprisingly I'm not a big fan of the vegan chicken strips so took those off my pizza , never been a fan. 

Wish they had more vegan options but it's great to see a place that can satisfy both types of people :-)"}
{"text":"Great Place to eat and they have a lot of healthy options.  We had pizza when we went and it was above average.  The Gluten free crust is actually in my opinion there best crust; so give it a try.  We brought our children and they enjoyed themselves and loved the pizza too.  One Piece of advice, we ordered a large pizza for the kids and got a medium pizza for ourselves.  When we got them they were essentially the same size.  We asked our server and she kind of was uncomfortable and said \" I know that is just the way it is\".. Not her fault, of course.  But if you go there and are getting pizza by the medium size.

Our service there was awesome.  I wish I remembered the girls name who served us, because she was great.  I always like the staff when I visit this restaurant.  
The Price is a little high, but worth going of time to time."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and sat outside for dinner. The ambiance was lovely. I was ecstatic that the entire menu is gluten-free! My son had the spicy pasta dish and it lived up to its name! He thought the noodles were mushy, I thought they were perfect. I split a pizza with the rest of the family. The crust was a bit singed on the end and a bit soggy in the middle. Gluten-free crusts are tricky that way. Otherwise, it was super flavorful. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not my style of pizza."}
{"text":"Much ado about not much! Ate there twice, and was shocked at how mediocre the food was. Yes, it has organic ingredients, but the chicken and pasta I ordered had minute amount of chicken, and it was barely mediocre. I ordered garlic and herbs on the side to add flavor to a relatively flavorless dish."}
{"text":"The pesto ravioli, spinach artichoke dip, and sangria was to die for. A gluten free dieters dream! Amazing food and amazing service! Luke was fabulous!"}
{"text":"I really, really love this restaurant. As someone who was diagnosed with Celiac more than 10 years ago, I appreciate a restaurant that has gluten free options, but having everything gluten free is just incredible. It's a tad pricey, especially if you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert (around $50/person), but there really is nothing like being able to choose anything off the menu. I'm always dragging my non-gluten-free friends and family here! Plus, they just brought back my favorite appetizer, the baked brie with roasted garlic, so I'm feeling very happy with them at the moment. They can accommodate those with Celiac as well as vegans, vegetarians, and health nuts!

My only complaint is that the food quality is inconsistent, so often times the same meals are vastly different depending on when you go and which location you go to. Additionally, the service can be kind of hit or miss.

Nonetheless, Picazzo's remains my go-to for gluten-free pizza, pasta, and great desserts-- I recommend the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. If you are looking for a safe, Italian place to eat without the risk of cross-contamination, Picazzo's has got your back."}
{"text":"Good Food + Service with an Organic Spin

Stopped in to celebrate a friend's birthday and had not heard of Picazzo's, prior. We were pleasantly surprised on entering-- comfortable but colorful interior was inviting; patio seating was appealing; and the service staff greeted us kindly. We were seated immediately by Elliott. 

We were able to order drinks and appetizers. We had the Caprese, baked BBQ wings, Siracha slaw, and cheese bread (free on Yelp! check in) hit the table with a minimum wait. All were very good, though general feeling was that the slaw was a bit milky and bland, and the wings were a tad too sweet. Still good, though.  

For the meal, we went with a Vortex pizza, a ravioli, and a Mac & Cheese. Excellent stuff! And Elliott was cordial while he checked on us regularly. Never did our drinks go empty, nor were we ever left waiting. And he was super nice to our little girls. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I am so excited to see a health conscious restaurant in the area. Secondly, I just about lost my marbles when the healthy restaurant was also Italian. My boyfriend and I stopped in here tonight and had a lovely little impromptu date night. It wasn't crowded for a Friday night, the atmosphere was very nice, and the moment we walked in we noticed how amazing it smelled. We were sat quickly, and service was very quick and efficient. We ordered the brie cheese appetizer, which was perfectly portioned, and delicious, along with wine and dinner. We both ordered pasta dishes, which were very flavorful and we each cleared our plates rather quickly to be honest. We did feel the portion of protein was a little on the light side, but we spoke with the GM Nick, and he told us the portions are supposed to be 5oz. across the board, and kindly took it upon himself to discount the meal. In any event, the food was delicious, and we will certainly be back! I was super excited to see zoodles (noodles made from zucchini) on the menu! I haven't seen that anywhere else, and zoodles are a staple when I prep for competition. So, to end this lengthy review. The food was great, the staff was amazing, and we both thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Healthy eating... vegan, vegetarian, or carnivorous. Favorite restaurant in town. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If this decision was based upon the food alone I would easily give this place 4 stars, but the service staff was horrible.

When we walked in the door there was no real host and the lady that sat us clearly did not want to be there. She was abrupt when she sat us and did not make us feel welcome.

The waitress was prompt in taking our drink orders but we waited 20 minutes for our food order to be taken and that only happened when I told another server (not our own) that we were ready to order. Unfortunately, the person that took our order was not our waitress but the disgruntled employee that sat us when we came in to the restaurant. 

Also, let me say that the poor service wasnt a product of a full restaurant or a staff that was spread thin. There were easily 4-5 wait staff and another 4-5 support staff in the restaurant.

Once our food arrived we were pleasantly surprised with the taste based upon the service that preceded it. I had the mushroom rotelli pasta with chicken added and it was very good. I heard nothing but good comment from the entire table on the food, but the extremely poor service is what gives this location terrible marks. 

Hopefully, it was just a bad night for the staff because I would like to go back for the pasta but I havent decided if I will take that step and return."}
{"text":"Great menu for alternative diets, especially those that are vegan and gluten free. They can be a bit pricey, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I will be returning for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Want gluten free pizza with out compromising the taste? This is the place to go to! I don't have a gluten alergy but my mom does so we are happy to find a whole restaurant that she can order anything off the menu. For myself, I am happy that it tast just as good as food that I'm used to eating too. Today my family and I tried the pepperoni pizza, vegetable pizza and the kale ceaser salad and all was tasty and delish! We also had the gluten free warm chocolate chip cookie and it was so soft and tasty too."}
{"text":"The appetizers are small potions but have flavor. The pasta was interesting and seasoned well. The service was horrible, bring your own food for snacks while you are waiting for your waiter."}
{"text":"Overpriced, average food, best part of evening was the wine. Would not recommend. Also pricey for the type of food. A half salad is close to the same as a full salad. They will not split salads in kitchen, you have to split at table, manager made sure that we would not ask next time, guess what , there wont be a next time."}
{"text":"The food was great; with organic and vegan options. It was a little slow to come out and our pizza was ridiculously expensive. Otherwise it was a good experience; great atmosphere and nice workers"}
{"text":"They have a great menu for lunch and for dinner! The pizza is so good and they offer a variety of healthy toppings. I also really like the salads, everything tastes so fresh. It gets busy sometimes, but they have a big patio if you don't mind enjoying the weather outside."}
{"text":"For someone like me with Celiac and a ton of food allergies, Picazzo's is like heaven.  Usually there are less than five things I can eat on a restaurant menu - here there are less than five things I can't eat. I've tried pizza, pasta dishes, chicken, appetizers, salads. 

Coming here makes my mouth and body happy. You just can't beat that."}

For those commenting on prices: everything they serve is organic, and everyone needs to be trained in cross-contamination prevention (among other things).  Gluten-free anything is more expensive even in a grocery store,  so expect the prices to be a bit higher than other restaurants.  I don't pay much less for a comparable meal on a GF bun at a place like Red Robin, which is loaded with GMOs and junk I'd rather not eat even if I could."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge two of us $40 for lunch, without alcohol, the service and food better be top notch. Unfortunately this visit to Picazzo's was a big miss.

I've been to Picazzo's in Flagstaff and on Frank Lloyd Wright on multiple occasions and it's always been good. I expected the same from this location, but was disappointed.

My partner and I headed out for our typical Saturday lunch and headed towards PV Mall. We initially were going to go to Chipotle or Oregano's but at the last minute I suggested Picazzo's. We were both hungry and in addition to our lunches I ordered soup and he ordered salad expecting them to arrive before our main course. They didn't. 

When the food finally arrived, it took quite a while, still no soup. Alas, the soup was the last thing to arrive and it was lukewarm. I prefer my food hot or at a minimum warm. When I got to my quinoa bowl overall the flavor was good, but it had cold spots throughout. And yes, it was designated as a hot dish.

My partner's salad and pasta dishes were, according to him, pretty bland. He's typically very easy going and it's unlike him to make negative comments about food. We'll find another place to go the next time."}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting with a friend. Ordered the cheese slice with a salad with Blue Cheese. Beverage of choice was Green Tea. The meal was very tasty, slice of pizza very adequate and the salad was also of nice proportion. The meal was filling and I didn't leave over stuffed like you sometime do after pizza. The meal was very healthy with all items organic."}
{"text":"Pasta was okay, tasted like what I'd make at home after a trip to whole foods. The gluten free bread was awesome and definitely the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, went with a large group and was able to try several different styles.  Heres what I had: Diavola pizza, The Vortex pizza, Southwest Chicken Pizza, Hawaiian pizza, Classic Gluten free pizza,  They were all very good!  My favorite was the Southwest chicken, and my least favorite was the Vortex (too \"olive-y\" for me, but a it was a couple of my friend's favorite).  Oh and the salads are really big, 4 people shared a small (appetizer portions)!
One negative about the experience was the waiter though.  This kid just didnt seem to know very much about anything, and wasnt very attentive to our large group (10 people).  When a friend asked about a beer he was unfamiliar with, the waiter described it for him, \"Its from California.  Its good.\"  when he asked about another beer, his description was very similar (although slightly more helpful), \"Its our darkest beer, its good.\"  Maybe they can educate their staff a little better about their menu."}
{"text":"Went with the family on a Saturday night.  Casual enough for the kids.  I had lasagne.  Food was tasty, but all the portions were very small, especially the kids servings.  Not great for the money.  I prefer Nick's."}
{"text":"I have been here on many occasions but went the other night for dinner and cocktails with a friend, who is also GF. This was my first visit since they revamped the menu. I liked their menu before but was really impressed with the new items. Almost everything on the menu is GF. My friend and I both got the Cucumber Basil Breeze drink, it's made with organic vodka, I didn't even know booze could be organic, my first organic buzz HA. For appetizers we got the Baked Brie & Roasted Garlic - SO yummy!  For our entree we each had the Baked Spinach Ricotta Cannelloni, delish! The flatbread that comes with is pretty decent. For dessert, my friend and I split the Eva's Organic Apple Cobbler and the Classic Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie, we both opted for the Coconut ice cream on top of each - to die for! I don't even want to know how many calories I consumed that night but the food was really really good. Nice to be able to eat \"real\" food, as being GF, you're somewhat limited when you go out to eat, but this place gets my 5-star rating and repeat visits."}
{"text":"We used this location for catering at a company event this week. The food was a huge hit! I thought it was impossible to make 30 people happy, but nope, there was something for everyone! Service was FANTASTIC both on the phone and delivery, Sean did a great job. Our huge, complicated order was made and delivered to perfection. I got so many compliments on the food choice, but the compliments should really be relayed to you guys. Thanks for the amazing, delicious food and quality customer service. :)"}
{"text":"The vegan options on the pizza are amazing! They can do most of their pizzas with vegan 'chicken' and cheese, and it tastes delicious! They also have bread options that are vegan and/or gluten free, and they also taste great. They have really good happy hour specials and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Picazzo's gluten free pizza is the best I have experienced.  They use high quality ingredients and it is not greasy.  They are serious of food allergies/dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"This is heaven for someone with celiac disease! This is one of the first places we come to when we are in Scottsdale. Everything is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food and healthy! We had the cheese bread and gluten free pizza and it was delicious!! Great customer service! The only problem was the price of the pizza, $19 for a 12in pizza!!"}
{"text":"It used to be our fav pizza place because they have a white sauce pizza with chicken and artichoke. Now we can't find it on the menu anymore. We tried to order their veggie pizza and added chicken but it is still not the same. 

Don't get me wrong. They still have a fresh made delicious pizza but our fav is no longer in the menu."}
{"text":"My daughter who has Celiac Disease and I really enjoyed Picazzo's today.  She enjoyed the chicken wings, BBQ maple flavor.  We shared the full Berry-licious salad with chicken, which we both loved.  Like a few others mentioned it is a bit pricey.  We had good service depite it being busy for a Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"I thought the the menu was very inventive and that the food was great.  We had a large party of eight with four kids and they found a way to get us in.

The pizza and salad menu was very different from your average place.  Everyone at our table got something different and each pizza was delicious.  The service was good; quick, friendly but nothing that truly stood out.  The prices do seem a little excessive, especially when you consider that each person is ordering a pizza and a salad (which produced a TON of left-overs).  I didn't get to see the final bill as my father-in-law fought for (and won) the bill, but I can only imagine that it was steep."}
{"text":"We have been to several picazzos restaurants and never have we been disappointed . The food is incredible and the service is friendly. How extraordinary to be able to come order anything off the menu and it is gluten free!   Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Omg so forget that their whole menu is gluten free, it was some of the yummiest food I ever ate. You usually have to compare gluten free food to other gluten free food, but this place can compete with non gf fare. It was just so... Special, to go into a restaurant that my hubby could order off the regular menu, anything he wanted. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!
The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  
I have a Gluten Sensitivity and am Lactose intolerant so this place was AMAZING for me.  All of the menu items and Gluten Free and only the Lasagna is unable to be Dairy Free.  The GF pizza dough was the fluffiness GF dough I've ever had.  It rose about 1/3\" which if you've ever had GF pizza before you know is a lot because most are cracker thin.  
If I lived in this area I would come every week.  They do have cheese and can make pizza with Gluten also so everyone can enjoy the menu and the cocktail menu is great too and they have GF bottled beers in addition to the draft beers."}
{"text":"Our server, Austin, was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He got our food to us at the perfect time and always made sure we were happy. He was really awesome and I'll be asking for his section next time for sure. The kale white bean soup and vegan pizza were both delicious. My husband had the egg plant parm and it was also very good. I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I have both eaten here and taken food to go many times but I've never left a review. This time I just had to. First, I have to say that the food is very good and having healthy and gluten-free options straight off the menu is fantastic! However, every single time I order food to go they mess up at least one aspect of my order! Seriously, every single time. That's the reason for only a three star rating. 

I ordered two salads. One with dressing on the side and the other just regular, no changes no modifications. I did get the dressing on the side, but the other salad had zero dressing and none on the side even. I took the food back to my office for lunch which was about 20 minutes away so it wouldn't make sense to turn around and go back for the dressing. I ended up eating a dry spinach salad. Sure, everyone makes mistakes sometimes, no worries. But the consistent errors on to go orders really detract from my enjoyment of this particular location."}
{"text":"This was first time trying Picazzo's, I saw they had decent reviews but I was extremely disappointed. I thought the food was terrible and way overpriced. My pasta entree tasted like a microwave dinner. The avocado toast was the worst I've ever had. It had avocado slices and arugula thrown on the bread (which tasted stale) with no extra flavoring at all. My money would have been better spent elsewhere. We will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I frankly can't believe that so many reviewers gave this joint a good review.  We arrive there this past Saturday night at 5:30 p.m. to take advantage of their half-price appetizers, which are over at 6 p.m.  It took a good ten minutes for the waitress to come get our drink order. ($2.95 for a tiny glass of diet coke...I don't care if it's refillable...you can get diet coke in any number of nice restaurants, without having to pay an arm and a leg for it.)  It took another ten minutes to get the drinks.  She asked if we were ready to order and when we said we wanted the half-price appetizers, she had the nerve to look at her watch and say it was 6 and that she would have to check to see if she could serve them half price.  Well, it WASN'T 6, it was 10 to 6.  As I started to give my order, the first word out of my mouth was that we needed separate checks.  My friend ordered the stuffed pepper appetizer and I ordered a half salad, with a side of grilled Portobello mushrooms.  One of our friends ordered a flatbread appetizer and the other ordered the Portobello appetizer drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  We waited for our food.  And waited.  And waited. We finally called over one of the other waiters, after about twenty minutes, to ask where the food was.  Well, lo and behold, it came right out!!!  Instead of bringing me the grilled portobellos, as requested, they brought me the Portobello appetizer.  When I told the fellows who brought out the food, that my order was wrong, they quickly fixed it, so that was good.  I asked my friend how her stuffed pepper was, and, while she told me it tasted good, she only had a tiny piece of sausage \"stuffed\" in the pepper.  My friend who ordered the flatbread appetizer was satisfied, as was I with my salad.  My other friend, who had ordered the Portobello appetizer, then ordered a pizza with the fellow (yes, we never saw our waitress again!), and we had to wait ANOTHER half hour for the pizza.  No wonder there were empty tables there on a Saturday night...other people must have experienced their wonderful service, too.  Stay away from this place...if you want a gluten-free pizza, ask Whole Foods to bake you one...I guarantee you will be happy with it.

P.S.  Of course, it came with one check...but, once again, the fellows who were helping us were nice and separated the checks."}
{"text":"I love the menu and the service is just great! Have eaten there numerous times and each time was excellent!"}
{"text":"Although I've been at a Picazzo's before, it was my first time at this location as it's fairly new. I'm so glad that this place opened up. I really enjoyed the one in Scottsdale and now there's one even closer to me. Last nights service was fantastic. Extremely friendly and fun employees/customer service. Excellent food! I have always had their lunch combination selection which is a great choice at a great price. 

I do like options and fortunately for diner decided to go with their happy hour appetizers for my meal. I had their wings and meatza-balls. Both were excellent tasting and actually even food for a meal and at a better price than their dinner selections. My wife and our friend had their salads and WOW. Those are huge and enough for two people as well as at a great price. I'm not much for salads but their salad presentation was fantastic and looked delicious. Definitely going to give those s try next time for even a healthier option. 

Overall very pleased with everything and will be coming here again even more!"}
{"text":"First time here and the service was excellent, prices were good. I had the lunch combo deal with the white bean soup, Lasagna bowl, and cheese bread. 

The Lasagna was quite good and good portion. I'll be trying this place again for sure. 

P.s. Make sure you check-in on YELP during your. I did and received a FREE cheese bread appetizer which was quite a lot and very delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Totally disgusted. To start, there was a hair in the hummus. They brought me another. Then a tiny small black hair was found in the wings. To top it off, another hair found on the rolled napkin. Needless to say Inwill Never go back and the health department will get a phone call! So much for healthy eating!"}
{"text":"If anybody out there is looking for vegan or vegetarian, this is your place. I ordered pasta Alfredo, vegan, with butternut squash ravioli. Amazing!  We sat in the bar just because we chose it. They give us options of dining indoor, bar and outdoor. The bartender, Luke, was extremely friendly fast, and courteous. While this place is a little pricey, and you can expect that because of the vegan and gluten-free options, I was extremely impressed with service, quality of food in the atmosphere. I honestly think you can't go wrong in this place."}
{"text":"I went here a few times when I first moved to AZ. This has since become one of my favorite places to eat. Not only is it good food but I can eat pretty much everything on the menu. I love the many many options for the gluten free people. I will continue to return and recommend this place to any other gluten free person."}
{"text":"I don't have any allergies, but I still love this place. It's a great option for when I go out with someone who is vegan or gluten free too.

First up, their lunch special is awesome. You can get a slice of pizza, a salad, and a drink all for about 11 dollars. I've also been in for dinner and they have great pizzas to share, along with pasta and some other hot dishes like chicken parm. They also have beer, wine and a selection of cocktails. 

The space is smaller but cute. They have indoor and outdoor seating, which has heaters for the chillier nights. The staff has always been super friendly and attentive, and they always ask the table if anyone has any allergies they should know about. 

Overall, this is a cute place to stop in when you want something on the healthier side!"}
{"text":"Went here in the afternoon with my mom for lunch. I do like how they have gluten free items on the menu. The service was fast and the employees were friendly and nice. I got a iced green tea and it didn't really taste like green tea. I got a pizza, don't remember which one but it was dry. That's probably the only reason why I didn't give this place 5/5 stars. I might come back here to give them a second chance but we'll have to see about that."}
{"text":"Good food! Somewhat pricey for the portion size, but it's also healthier ingredients. The food was fantastic! Great flavor. We had exceptional service with our waitress Alex. Very attentive and kind. Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Picazzo's was a favorite place to eat for my family until our most recent experience at the location on Cactus Rd.  We always get our food to go and I typically order the kale salad.  Much of my kale was fuzzy, looked completely unwashed and was visibly rotting in my salad.  I dumped my salad out, because there were just too many pieces of kale that were clearly rotting and when I did, I saw multiple bugs crawling around the to-go box.  The salad was one day old (not even 24 hours).  This experience may have caused me to lose my appetite for Picazzo's entirely, but for sure, my family will not be returning to this particular location.  I have posted photos as well."}
{"text":"Just went here with a friend for lunch and shared the gluten free pepperoni pizza.  It took 30 minutes to come out and half the crust was still uncooked and doughy. It was also completely bland and I was looking for gum to get the taste out of my mouth after it. The service was very slow, quiet, and reserved.  Will not be going back to this location. Only reason I gave two stars is because people have said they have good salads."}
{"text":"We have tried this place one time in Sedona and we had all pizzas it was pretty good and we thought there was a lot of variety.  We saw that they are in our area that we recently moved to and remembered we tried it before.  Extremely disappointing.  Our waiter was not knowledgeable of the menu, offered no advice and we had to use other waiters to get anything.  All of us left our food either after 2 bites or not even 1/2 the dish eaten - we just wanted to pay and leave to finally get the check but had to wait forever just for that too!  We will never be back as a microwave dinner is way better from Whole Foods.  I filled out a comment card and left it behind with the \"manager\" that had no interest, but we literally paid $100 for absolutely nothing . Our son wouldn't even eat his \"Caesar salad\" it was so bad. Go to Pizza Heaven, New Vegetarian Green or Coronado.  It's worth going rather than throwing your money away and going somewhere else because the food and service was so horrible.  Just pure honesty....."}
{"text":"I don't think I realized the vast gluten free options here.  WOW.  Very comfy, casual restaurant, not fussy.  GREAT salad - I had the one with greens, apples, walnuts, avocado and this insanely good fig balsamic vinegar dressing.  My cousin had a grilled chicken Caesar and she didn't leave a spec!  Next time, gluten free pasta dish!"}
{"text":"I don't know about all these complainers...but Picazzo's is awesome! I love that I can can any dessert on the menu because it is all gluten free! Food is healthy and delicious and I've never had anything bad on the menu. Definitely one of my favorite lunch and dinner spots!"}
{"text":"Although I was excited to try a new pizza place, i was not impressed. The variety seemed a bit much for a gourmet pizza and salad joint. Many of the pizzas seemed to be very similar with the exception of 1 or 2 ingredients. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the option of gluten-free sounds appealing to those with gluten allergies. But overall, not many of the choices seemed desirable. I chose the 'fire in the hole' on regular crust. It boasted red and yellow bell peppers, fresh garlic, pepperoni, jalapenos, carmelized onions and cheddar with crushed red pepper flakes. it sounded exciting until i saw it and tasted it. The onions were not carmelized and they were oversized, allowing it to dominate other flavors save the jalapeno. The jalapeno were in medium slices, with the webbing and seeds intact. It is true that the pizza boasted of its spiciness with its eponymous title. But diced jalapeno without seeds or webbing would have added flavor and heat without compromising the other flavors. Perhaps the bell pepper and garlic were bland. Perhaps not. 
On the plus side, I found the crust very tasty. But even with regular thickness, compared to thin or ultra thin, the toppings were too heavy  and the pie became a flaccid mess. For the price, I doubt I would get this one again.
Finally, the waitress hovered around us. She was in my sight of vision, spot checking us every 20 seconds. This became cumbersome. She did not share any specials (not really sure if they have any) or recommendations on an entree or alcoholic beverage. Another waiter was quick about refilling our beverages without being noticeable. 
Food was obnoxiously drab and the service needs to be less observable and more engaging with my palette."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza and beer as well as other Italian fare that is organic so tastes fresher!  Very accommodating to groups!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place when it was Buon Gusto. It is our neighborhood bar/restaurant. The staff was amazing, along with great food.  The food is still great, however, when the \"new\" owner took over in October of 2013 and fired all of the previous staff, the new staff is terrible.  We have been in 3 times since Picazzo's took over again...2 times we have encountered Josh in the bar area.  He seems to hate his job. Not sure where he came from, but he doesn't greet customers with a friendly vibe at all.  Both times with him serving, we sat with empty drinks for over 30 minutes. I practically had to beg him to even order a pizza.  Isn't that what customers come in to do?? Order food and drinks? We won't be coming in again, unfortunately, even though it is so convenient with great food."}
{"text":"Delicious organic Italian food! Awesome vegan options for an Italian restaurant! Picazzo's definitely catered to my needs and cravings of a good pizza. My friends and I ordered a custom vegan pizza that was so delicious!! They also have a beautiful organic cocktail menu.

Its a little pricy but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We drove aimlessly around town looking for something and the word \"Organic\" catches my eye.

The reviews on Yelp were unimpressive... I usually try to stay at 4+ stars. But I wanted something easy to pick up to take to our hotel (and I might have been hung over.)

We got the Mac and cheese, Italian salad and combo pizza. 

Now, I had zero interest in the pizza. My heart was set on the Mac and cheese, and since I had no pictures on Yelp, that I could see... My hopes were high. Well, I was disappointed. I'd suggest switching the pasta. And making the sauce creamier or more of it!? I loved it came with veggies. Bacon was very good. Might be better if it was eaten at the restaurant, so I won't take away any stars.

The salad was very good, really liked the creamy Italian but... There was just sooooo much meat. Had like 5 tomato pieces... Wish there was more veggies (I know, who the heck ever says that?!)

The pizza was so good! Yeah I know, I said I didn't want any... But hubs said it was light and flavorful. Man, Carmelized onions... So good. Bell peppers had really great flavor too. 

I'd go back."}
{"text":"We've been twice in the last 2 weeks. This place has gotten really good. We tried it a few times several years ago and it wasn't good at all so they have definitely improved their menu. I love all of the gluten free options and their gluten free pizza is the best I have ever had and I have tried a lot of gluten-free pizza! They are very allergy friendly too as my sun has nut allergies and they took it very seriously. Service was a tad slow but overall a great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Bumped up again to 5 stars because customer interaction is key and hey, it's picazzos and any appetizer half off at healthy hour is a steal. Thank you for serving quality food."}
{"text":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen. 

We came for happy hour (because as I've previously stated, things are over-priced, so at least the appetizers are brought down to what they should cost anyway), were promptly seated, and our drink orders were immediately taken.  I had the same waitress that I had the last time I came here, nearly a year ago (September 2014). However, being that management responded to my previous post in such a sincere manner, I assumed any previous issues would be addressed and I expected the best.

Well, I'm glad I didn't bet on that!  There was no change. She was still unengaged and seemingly annoyed that we took a while to order.  We did have a new guest, one who had never been to this restaurant before; one who hails from Italy and was cautious about this Americanized Italian food. (For good reason!)  

On to the food:
I ordered the vegan \"chicken\" wings in Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce. The wings were indeed very good, however, I learned later (while writing the review and looking at my receipt) that I'd been given RED THAI CURRY VEGAN WINGS instead. I had to go back and update my posted photo from that day. 

RED THAI CURRY PASTA (made vegan):
The vegan option comes with a brown rice penne pasta, vegan chicken, broccoli, mixed veggies, green onions, and almonds.  I omitted the almonds and any peas that may have come with the mixed veggies. This dish was ok. I don't know why I keep ending up with underwhelming flavored pasta dishes here. It's sad, really.  Oh, and this dish came with a LOT of what turned out to be eggplant (not mentioned in the menu description). I spent a considerable amount of time picking these out of my dish. 

DD got the JAMBALAYA dish, which she said was better at the Sedona location. She said it wasn't as spicy at this location. She did omit the chilis, but they were also omitted when she ordered in Sedona, so...  

My other DD ordered a CHEESE PIZZA without the sauce. (She doesn't like American pizza sauce.) She said that her pizza was ok. 


FOCACCIA BREAD: 
This bread is automatically vegan. It's yummy, but there is no vegan butter option to accompany it; they only have regular butter.  Luckily, the busboys (I'm sure that there's another name for this job, but it escapes me atm), were very attentive.  They kept the water topped, and one even brought some oil and vinegar for dipping the bread. 
Side note: the Italian DD says that this isn't authentic focaccia bread.


1/2 way through our meals, the waitress brought our check and sat it in the middle of the table. There was no, \"Would you like anything else?\" or \"Are you interested in dessert?\" It was more of a \"pay up and get out\" feel.  When I informed her that we'd like dessert, she seemed flabbergasted.  *eye roll* See? Now you've wasted a tree because you have to re-print the receipt.  As the check sat on the table, my Italian DD mentioned that she never received her Coca-Cola soda, and asked me to check to make sure I wasn't charged for it. I looked and indeed, I was charged.  I did bring this up to the waitress when she returned with our desserts and she brought out the Coke (AFTER the main meal was done and over). 

DESSERTS:
Vegan Apple Cobbler w/ coconut ice cream. This was yummy. The cobbler was hot and sweet and the vegan ice cream was creamy and delicious. They even put some chocolate syrup on it. 

Italian DD got the CHEESECAKE w/ CARAMEL SYRUP. She really like her dessert as well.



Lastly, Picazzo's has a REWARDS PROGRAM. It's mentioned on their receipts and on their website, but the waitress never asks if you're a part of the program. AND if you forget to give them your rewards account number, the company only allows you 3 times to add after your visit
So, you'd think the employees would ask customers if they're a part of the rewards program prior to printing out the receipt, because GUESS WHAT? I AM a rewards member. I had points to redeem (and a Groupon too), so she had to re-print the receipt AGAIN. *sigh* So much for being eco-friendly.  Oh, and she said that a manager had to come over to scan the Groupon. That manager creepily came around my shoulder, scanned my phone and left. No, \"hello,\" or \"How was your meal?\" He said nothing; just scanned from over my shoulder and disappeared again.  (I saw another manager speaking with other patrons, but we were never address.) 


Their prices are too high to have bad service, messed up orders, and forgotten items.  I still left a tip, mainly because of the busboys, but it was substantially lower than what I'd normally leave. 

Oh, and my Italian DD, who has only been in the U.S. for 2 weeks, asked, \"Are you sure this is supposed to be Italian?\"  I think that statement speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly waitstaff but the gorgonzola and fig pizza was doughy and undercooked. Kale salad though flavorful had many yellowed leaves and was tough. Kale needed a good massage. Maybe the pasta would have been a better choice. Price for one large pizza and one kale salad was $47 plus tip! .....In response to comment from management: price included a soda plus tax so my price is closer to the truth. The bottom line is that your subpar pizza and salad are expensive and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Gluten free everything!!! 
 -pizza
 -croutons
 -ALL desserts
 -pasta

The best part is it tastes great! This place is perfect for my boyfriend and I. We are both gluten intolerant and they really understand how to make the food taste amazing and they have tons of options!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME COMING TO THIS RESTAURANT! Me and my husband were not able to be together on Valentine's Day so we made plans to go out to dinner and then see a show downtown. We saw this was healthy Italian and it was nearby so we went last night around 6pm. Well I guess dinner time isn't a good time to go out to dinner because the restaurant did not have time for us. We were seated right away but in the forty minutes we were there we only were able to get a drink and the waitress to take our order. We didn't have any bread on the table and we were hungry not expecting to have to wait so we asked for the bread to be brought out. A very rude and obviously ignorant to the service industry waitress insisted that we be patient with them because the kitchen was behind. \"Sir you are going to have to be patient with us our ....\" I couldn't believe it. No \"I'm sorry for the wait\" or an incentive to stay saying \"I'll get the bread and dessert is on us\" just a demand that we be patient. I got better treatment at the McDonald's later on in the evening when I wanted a late night snack. I had to wait a bit in the drive through so the gentleman without prompt gave me my drink for free. That's an example of excellent service NOT a demand for a customer to be patient. We will not be returning. The food looked good and the restaurant has a great concept so it is really a shame the management does not know how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here 2 nights in a row! Sat at the bar. Great food and great service from Cody and Travis!"}
{"text":"Wow! Where has this place been all my life? A truly healthy menu with options galore! I had a lunch special today which was a huge portion! I had Zo's chopped salad and the spicy Thai peanut chicken pasta but I substituted the pasta to zoodles. My only complaint was the amount of zoodles I got. My dish seemed to be extremely soupy but tasty to say the least. They also have a daily happy hour which I plan to check out!!  My friends had pizza slices which they thought were delicious! The lunch special was a great deal too!! Can't wait to make this a regular spot!!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant!!! The original pizza crust is soooo delicious. We had the vegan BBQ chicken which was our go to, but discovered the vortex pizza this visit, and I must say it's my new favorite dish! We also tried the wings and the the hummus appetizer, and the jalapeño cranberry Hummus is SO DELICIOUS!!! I wish I could buy some to take home. Definitely try!!"}
{"text":"These people are awesome and their food is really good. We eat here once a week and have yet to have a bad meal. Their gluten free pizza crust is the best in town by far. The manger Nicole always treats everybody like a VIP."}
{"text":"Simply superb. Amazing food, great customer service. The place is very nice in and out, bathrooms are top notch as well. Prices are extremely reasonable considering everything is organic.
Only thing I did not like is when the hostess brought the food she had her thumb close to it, the way she was holding the plate. She should have had gloves on."}
{"text":"Gluten free! This is a breathe of fresh air to the community. I am so grateful that this restaurant is providing a service that is definitely needed. We had a delightful lunch of soup, salad and pizza. Everything tasted homemade and fresh. It was a very busy Thursday lunch. The bar and restaurant were very busy and it was quite noisy. If this is the atmosphere you are looking for, then this is the place. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"I love that I can get delicious food and not worry about allergies getting in the way. This place has great, healthy options and caters to those with food intolerances/allergies/preferences. Try the vegan pizza crust - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved my visit to Picazzo's! I could not believe the incredible gluten free choices on the menu like cheese breadsticks, lasagna, and focaccia, which I have not been able to order in a restaurant for years. I was in Gluten Free heaven! The food was delicious, and my husband who does not eat gluten free could not tell the difference. We really enjoyed our visit and will definitely return frequently."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that Picazzos opened in Glendale. But I was quickly disappointed. Our waitress brought us water with food stuck to the glasses. So instead of complaining we tried to flag her down to just order different drinks and could not get her attention. I was even talking to her and she walked away both times and did not listen. I mentioned to another table that you have to be pretty to get service here. And they laughed because yes they didn't have trouble getting service. We were treated like we had the plague. We did finally get service from a different male waiter and he was happy to get our drinks and cheese bread. And then had to grab him again for boxes. We had ordered 2 12\" gluten-free artichoke and shrimp pizzas and it was so greasy, we could hardly eat it. The gluten-free cheesy bread was good. Not sure if we will be back. The service and food weren't worth the $63 plus tip. But if we do go back I might need to borrow someone who is nice looking... lol."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem after a lesson at the dance studio next door. The fiance and I love trying new places and although we didn't know prior to entering that all the food here is organic and fresh, we were glad to find that out! they have 1/2 off appetizers from 3-6pm so we ordered the meat balls and stuffed peppers. Both were okay. The peppers were difficult to eat because the skin was still rough. However, the drinks were so good--he had the antioxidant cocktail and I had the sangria. Even better were the salads! I had the italian chopped salad & substituted w/kale (no upcharge) and he had the kale chopped--both very different and very good! the salad was so flavorful and fresh. We took them home and had them later that night and they were still delicious. We'll probably make this a regular stop after our lessons!"}
{"text":"I like this place quite a bit.  Noticed a video review about the Gluten free.  http://deborahapeters.com  Glad it's working for them.  we get the gluten free extra crispy gives it good texture when looking for a gluten free pie."}
{"text":"I was so glad that my friend suggested that we went there, as she stated she saw a g-free sign. We went for an early dinner, my friend not knowing what gluten is and how it affects one who has celiac if they don't eat g-free. Our waitress Denise was super helpful and took her time, to explain to my friend and also give recommendations on what to eat since my friend and I had never been.  I ordered the shrimp scampi, a few too many capers but still delish and my friend order one of the pizzas that wasn't g-free.  Overall this place awe-amazing! We also ordered the apple crisp dessert with vanilla ice cream, yum!  We ate dinner and dessert for under $40 that's pretty amazing considering it was g-free too. It's hard to find good tasting food in Northern Cali that is g-free and not pricey. If you're in town or a Scottsdale resident it a must to visit, request Denise too :)"}
{"text":"Everything I said before is still true, but now I have eaten here enough that it's my go-to place! 

The staff is friendly & the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food! I have tried everything from roasted veggies to Tiramisu & it's ALL amazing!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot after a round of golf.  Real good beer selection, to pair with real fresh Italian food.  The pasta was perfect and really fresh with excellent flavors.

The slice of the day had a good crust and good sauce to condiment ratio not overpowering at all on any flavor.

Nice little spot, which I can see getting packed on a busy day but would be worth the wait.  Will be heading back to this place very shortly!"}
{"text":"Picazzo's is an Italian kitchen that features an organic and gluten-free menu. To be honest it was kind of a turn off for me as gluten-free and organic usually means it tastes weird. Such is not the case here. We chose this place because one of our party has a gluten allergy. Not everything on the menu is gluten-free, but they do take special care to make sure there is no cross contamination. My wife has a coconut allergy and was concerned about the menu having coconut in the ingredients. Our waiter checked to make sure there was no coconut in what she ordered.

I chose the lunch combo which is your choice of pizza, pasta or a baked dish; and soup or salad. My choice was the slice of the week (pizza) which was Italian sausage and caramelized onion. I also ordered the creamy tomato basil soup. In a short time my lunch was on the table. I could have made a meal of just soup. The tomato soup was smooth and creamy with basil and a hint of cayenne, nothing too intense. The pizza was also very good. Although the crust wasn't gluten-free it was still organic and whole wheat. They do offer a gluten-free crust.There was not a lot of sauce on the slice which opened the door for the other flavors to come through. The pizza was baked perfectly and had a generous amount of toppings. 

Our waiter was attentive through the meal keeping our drinks full and answering any questions we had. I got a complimentary piece of raspberry cheese cake for checking in on Yelp. I was going to split it with my wife, but it contained a small amount of coconut. Our waiter brought her a complimentary scoop of ice cream since she couldn't have the cheese cake.

I am quite impressed with Picazzo's. This place totally exceeded my expectation of what healthy food should taste like. I would recommend Picazzo's to anyone with food a food allergy as they take strive to make a great tasting meal with respect to their dietary restriction."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. We've been looking for a vegan option on the west side. We came back 2 days in a row because its so good. We put the Buddha bowl on top of the Margarita vegan pizza with marinara sauce. Staff is very friendly, we forgot to have them hold the cheese on a dish, they replaced it with hesitation. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Happy Hour prices aren't really that great but in general we have always enjoyed our meals and good service."}
{"text":"Good food. Always fresh. The service is not quick, but that's what you get when you're at a place that caters to those of us with allergies and looking for healthy fresh food. We continue to go back, especially for weekend lunches."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. This restaurant was recommended to my husband by his nutritionist at the Mayo Clinic here. Our server made us feel very comfortable immediately. He knew and said all the right things when my husband asked him about their process for celiac customers. He told us that his restaurant was opened for people like him...before being gluten free became an \"it\" diet. This place is so dedicated to being a safe place for celiacs that they actually have a dedicated \"gluten\" area to make sure there are few chances of cross contamination. They have a dedicated gluten free oven for their pizzas. Everything is gluten free EXCEPT for when you specify that you want a GLUTEN pizza. 

We started with the cheesy garlic bread. I thought the bread consistency was good but there was a lack of flavor. Perhaps the cheese needed to be a bit saltier.  For my meal, I had the shrimp scampi which was different from others I've had, but it was really good. I especially liked that they had capers in it. My husband had the pizza that had avocado in it. He absolutely loved it. He even wanted to order another pizza and a gnocchi to go. Since he ordered the 16\"....YES 16\" GF, he realized he already had a lot of food to bring home. 

If you're craving pizza, croutons, pasta, etc. give this place a try. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to go to the Pasta Pomodoro at this location all the time and loved it.  We were really bummed when that closed.  We thought we'd give Picazzo's a shot because the location is very convenient for us.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The decor was pretty blah, and the pizza on the menu I felt was on the expensive side.  We both ordered pasta dishes, which were good and the portions reasonably sized.  Our waitress was friendly.  There just wasn't anything to make me really want to go back."}
{"text":"Just went there based on reviews of great pizza - ordered 1 kid's pasta and 1 medium pizza - it took more than ONE HOUR for the food to come!!!!!!!!!  If you have a ton of time, the food, once it arrived was ok - but definitely not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Excellent service and food. Came to this location for lunch and had a slice of cheese pizza and greek side salad. Dee-licious! Pricing is very fair too! The Tatum and Cactus location has the cutest little cozy bar and a perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine and have a great convo with the bartender. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly, and service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and our meal was brought out quickly. Food was delicious.   I'm not a local living in San Diego currently. But whenever I'm in town this has become my new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Love the straight forward gluten free foods you can count on. Want to make that vegetarian or vegan, they've got you covered. Massive salads with meat and beyond meat options for the low carb folks too. Bonus: organic wine! We come here every time we are in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great Gluten-Free Pizza and Dessert Menu!

Picazzo's is the only true pizza resturant I've found in the valley (and Sedona and Flagstaff for that matter) that has a full Gluten-Free menu including drinks and desserts. It's nice to be able to go out to dinner with friends and have a whole gf menu ready for me so I don't have to feel like the weird kid out. 

It's a bit expensive for the gf pizza...somthing like $18 when I get all the goodies on top, but to me it's worth it and the pizza itself is fabulous. I usually get the veggie pizza and then toss some pepperoni or sausage on it to spice it up a bit. The medium is a good size for 2 people and will leave 1 person enough to take leftovers home."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan and this restaurant will become a \"regular\" for us. If you need gluten free or other special dietary options - Picazzo's is great!  Having visited the restaurant at the Promenade off Frank Lloyd Wright and also the one in Sedona, I would say this was the \"middle\" experience.  Sedona was our best experience (could it have been all the hiking we did before going there?) and Frank Lloyd Wright was just average.

At this Picazzo's on Cactus we sat on the patio next to the fire.  Had great dolmas for an appetizer, FAB Thai peanut pasta (gluten free!) and sulfite free wine.  As someone with food sensitivities this was BY FAR the best I've felt after eating out at an Italian restaurant.

Definitely check out Picazzo's - they are willing to modify anything and will satisfy even the non-gluten free folks in your group."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The food and service is always wonderful.  I love that they have organic and fresh food. And it's so delicious.  I was sad to see the menu shrink down -- they removed at least half if their pizza selections.  The bacon and Brussels sprouts was my favorite. Sigh. But there's still lots of good choices left. I'm not gluten free but my sister is and some of my friends are.  This is one of my favorite go to places with my GF peeps.  And their lunch specials are such a great deal! Large food portions and a drink for such a low cost if you can make it for lunch."}
{"text":"I forgot to mention that they have a gluten free pizza cookie.  Can't get much better than that."}
{"text":"My family and I always go to this little pizza joint, when family members are in town.

Great organic food, that is fresh and super tasty!

Caesar salad with pine nuts, and feta cheese, YES please.

Their cracker thin crust is delightful.  

Get to Picazzo's today and you'll be amazed with their food."}
{"text":"All locations are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!  We spend every birthday there and special occasions too our favorite!!!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted with a smile & seated promptly. Restaurant was fairly busy for a Thursday, 1:15pm, but our server didn't miss a beat. Her name was Rachael and she was very polite, knowledgeable, answered menu questions, took our order quickly, brought our drinks to us right away. She checked back with us throughout out our meal yet not in a disturbing manner. She never let our iced teas run out. Food was very good, the portions seem to be more like they used to be, back to a good size. I noticed the manager (Steve) made his way through all the dining areas (inside, outside & bar) to double check that customers were satisfied with their meals. Overall a great lunch out, much better than last time, we gave her a 30% + tip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for lunch. They have really great pizzas and salads. My favorites are the chicken pesto pizza and the pear Gorgonzola salad. They have great prices, atmosphere and service. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"We come here every year on vacation. I have Celiac and am always excited to have a delicious, GF meal. We love the extensive menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. Staff are friendly and pay attention to detail. The food is awesome! I have been pleased with both of my dishes. The menu is large, you will find something you are in the mood for. This has become a favorite for us, we will be back and hungry for the next delicious dish!"}
{"text":"Tried the vegetable lassange and it was very good. Still love the pizza best."}
{"text":"Wow, so yummy! The GF menu is just over the top!  We have found our new hot spot! HEALTHY AND DELICIOUS....Dana was fantastic as well, very knowledgeable as we had a so many questions, very patient with us!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! We had the lunch special, which was a slice of pizza and a salad and drink. Everytging was tasty and fresh. A little pricey for lunch but I'd definitely go back. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Our go to are the roasted veggies. Simply delish. Throw some chicken in the mix. Tonight we tried the chicken parm. A new menu item. We especially like the Avacado pudding for dessert."}
{"text":"Experience all the pretension of California Pizza Kitchen with none of the service or pizza! Seriously, how snooty and obnoxious is it when the drinks section lists only an assortment of bottled waters and Italian sodas, then at the bottom in small print: \"If you simply MUST have it, we also carry Cola, Lemon-Lime, and Dr. P.\" As though they are doing us lowly soft drink partakers a favor by sinking to our level. Yet, when pressed, they still wouldn't reveal whether their \"cola\" was Coke, Pespi, or something else (some of us care, yo). 

We only came here because we won a $50 gift card, and I would never come back. The hostess was nice, but the service ended there. Our server was snippy, looked angry the whole time, screwed up our drinks twice, then snapped at us when we tried to correct her. Our pizza was only barely cut, we mostly had to rip it apart ourselves, and the busboy kept trying to take our plates before we were done and without asking. 

The pizzas were vaguely interesting in theory, but not very good in practice. There were very few options in the way of regular pizza if you didn't want to try one of their many \"theme\" pizzas (bbq chicken pizza, pasta pizza, enchilada pizza, etc). We tried the Shrimp Scampi pizza, which was tough and undercooked, and the \"Meaty Meaty\" pizza, which was okay, but had about six pieces of meat on the entire large sized pizza. 

Overall, it was a free meal, and we left full, but it was uncomfortable, and only moderately tasty. I would certainly not come here again and pay,  given their extraordinary prices (a large and small pizza, two sodas, and a garlic bread appetizer for $52???), mediocre pizza, and lousy service. Definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"As a gluten-sensitive eater, I really appreciate Picazzo's. Everything is gluten-free besides the optional gluten pizza dough (cooked in separate oven). I love that I can even order a gluten-free beer here when I'm in the mood. 

Their focaccia is delish, especially when dipped in olive oil. I also love their chopped salad & tomato bisque combo for lunch. Pizza is good too. I'm not in love with their pasta, chicken piccata or lasagne, though. 

My friend's daughter has celiac & they NEVER EVER go out to eat for fear of cross contamination. I assured them that Picazzo's is a safe place even for those with celiac & brought them here when they were in town visiting. It was fun to see their little girl gobbling up everything & living like a \"normal\" kid.

I wish they'd bring back their Bolognese Rosa sauce - it was my favorite thing on their menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Picazzo's!  It's tasty, the service is great, it's got good cocktails, and it's the number one place I trust with my dietary restrictions.  As someone with a lot of food allergies, who has visited this restaurant time and time again, I always feel safe eating here.  Practically the entire menu is gluten free, but even my gluten-eating friends/family love it here.  The food is delicious and made with wholesome ingredients.  It's a little pricey and portions for pasta are a little small for the price, but everything else is worth it.  

I crave their salads and green tea daily."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we intend to come back. Often.
As we are on a gluten-free diet now, Picazzo's seems to be the sole respite for us to have Italian. Except for their ravioli and baked pasta dishes, all of their pastas are quinoa gluten-free, but you can choose to have rice gluten-free instead. It is SO nice to see a restaurant that offers variety.

Their breads and croutons are ALSO GF! (We almost didn't believe them when they said that the bread that came with our pasta was GF! It was delicious!)

For pizzas they offer a medium size as gluten-free. We chose to try their pasta tonight but will return to try their GF pizza next time. Apparently they have a soy-free, dairy-free mozzarella cheese as well. THANK YOU! Again, we'll come back to try that.

They were crazy busy on a Friday night, as expected, but it was totally worth it. The chocolate chip skillet cookie with coconut vanilla ice cream was superb! I believe all of their desserts are GF also.

If I can make a suggestion to the restaurant, I would love to see their GF pizza crusts in different sizes, and I would also love to see a \"choose your own\" pasta option as well."}
{"text":"Great selection of organic, vegan, and vegetarian items. Server was very friendly and knowledgeable. It got busy at lunch so off-hours are best if you can. The lunch combos seem like a good value. The regular menu items are a bit expensive, but you are paying for higher quality ingredients."}
{"text":"While the decor is not special, our server made our dinner very enjoyable! Andrew made terrific suggestions-we  each ordered something different and shared! Great fun, wholesome and delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this restaurant.  Enjoy going to both this location and the one by PV Mall.  My go to favorite is the chopped salad, I am never disappointed.  I also love both the sangria and prickly pear margherita.  Service is always good and friendly.  If their patio was dog friendly it would be five stars!"}
{"text":"We usually take out more than dine in, and its the Berrylicious Salad that keeps us coming back. We've dined in, had a bottle of red wine and a GF Pizza, but the salad won us over. Usually after a Gym Sesh we'll call in the Berrylicious Salad, extra chicken, no goat cheese and add pears and apples. We'll arrive minutes later to the salad done and ready. The staff is fast and nice. The salads are heavenly, always keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Picazzo's ... where have you gone? You used to be one of my favorite places to visit but you have fallen from grace. Service was good and I appreciate that but the food was sub-par. My salad arrived with a variety of greens that were not listed on the menu and my server apologizing for the substitution. You might have asked me if I wanted kale... I did not. That's why I didn't order the kale salad. The lettuce was brown on the edges and the $1.50 I paid for a sliver of avocado was ridiculous. I can't decide if I'll try you again or not.  I appreciate your nod to health, but meh..."}
{"text":"I love you guys 
Drool-worthy pizza
(Vegan gluten free; & made to perfection)
The beverages rule 
Outstanding customer service at every second of the day.
This place is a treat to have on earth."}
{"text":"Organic and delicious, I ate all of the happy hour avocado toast and couldn't eat my salad, I highly recommend and we will be back.  Great customer service,  ask for Dana, she's a doll."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Picatta to go for $17. I am not a big-portion person so for me to write this is extraordinary: SMALLEST PORTION EVER!!! I could not believe my eyes, I even took a pic of it. Had I not been 8 miles away by the time I opened it at home, I would have returned it. I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"I have been contemplating trying this place for a while and have driven by it many times.  My better half and I hit it up Friday night and I was very pleased!  It was  not too crowded and I enjoyed the atmosphere and artwork.  The music was good and the service was excellent.  I had baked wings and a Neapolitan pizza which were both very good.  Obviously since this restaurant has been in the area over 6 years they are doing something right.  I will definitely keep this in mind for my pizza cravings, up there with Nello's, and the new Spinato's in the area."}
{"text":"Really good italian food 4 stars due to pricing was a little high for drinks and such but really good food"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. All gluten free, vegan friendly, organic, healthy, healthy stuff! The pizza is DELICIOUS! We've been coming here for years and it's fantastic every time. We had Nick as our server last and he was so personable and friendly! He was on it! It is a little pricier, however, you're definitely getting what you pay for in the quality of the food. Great location in the Promenade plaza!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best. Having celiacs makes eating out extremely difficult and can feel very limiting and isolated at times but Picassos makes us feel like we can eat anything again (because we can on their menu!). Not only that but the food actually tastes amazing! No cardboard cheese bread here! Absolutely love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Side dining room was hidden and narrow, artwork was nice. place needs a facelift. Waitress was not knowledgeable nor very well trained. Pizza was ok but average ( was at CIBO recently) and if you compared to them there is no comparison. If you like average this is your place."}
{"text":"\"It's not you, it's me.\"

If you're into organic and gluten free food, you'll love it here. If not, it'll seem a bit overpriced. It's not their fault, I just think that you have to already be into that kind of stuff to really appreciate it. The staff was really friendly, the food was good and the place was clean. It didn't blow me away, but that's me--not them."}
{"text":"Great new menu! Good and service was excellent. Need more neighborhood places like Picasso."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. I love the menu with its extensive vegan options. Every dish I've ordered has been perfectly prepared and delicious. The service is outstanding."}
{"text":"I came here alone for lunch on a weekend,I sat outside and I received no service.
However the food is amazing!
The three stars are only for the food.
I have come here many times I usually get good service because we are as a group maybe a single customer is not worth the effort."}
{"text":"What a great gem of a restaurant. I was in the area for a conference so met a friend for dinner. Glutten free Garlic bread, Hmmmm? Gluten free bread is pretty nasty so I was skeptical. It was Delish! The Bruschetta was yummy and we split a wonderful salad. Our server was magnificent too. I wish they had a location closer to me. Oh yeah, they have a nice bar too. Thanks Piccazzo's."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my select few favorite restaurants in Arizona.  The service has always been spectacular, no matter how many people, a big group, or kids.  The food is fantastic, whether it's the pizza or another dish.  Great atmosphere and location.  I will always come back here."}
{"text":"Can't imagine why this great place has only three stars!  Two of us shared an Italian Chopped Salad and it was delicious.  One of the best I have ever eaten.  Service was very good - price was more than reasonable.  

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my girlfriend and her parents. Our server was very nice and everything started out great. I only had an issue when 3 out of our 4 meals showed up. We let the servers know but kept waiting. About 10 minutes later, a man walked up and asked how our dinner was. Well, maybe check to see if everyone has their food before doing a check in with the table. Needless to say, we were all done with our meals when the 4th one finally showed up. We then had to ask for that to be taken off the bill rather than it being offered (which it eventually was). Other than that, it was good."}
{"text":"Healthful, organic and tasty! 

I love how this place caters to dietary needs. The non-dairy cheese is very good, they also have many gluten free options (pasta and pizza) I have tasted the gluten free crust before, and I have to say, I think I liked it better than the whole grain crust! 

It's nice you can custom order your pizza, just be aware that it will probably come out even more expensive than if you order from the regular menu. If you decide to get a whole grain crust, or if you need to order gluten free, it's also going to cost you more because they will not make small sizes with those crusts. It has to be medium. I ordered a whole grain vegetarian pizza with dairy-free cheese....it came out to be like 25 bucks...yikes! BUT, you do get what you pay for.....quality ingredients, and hey, they know how to make pizza! 

Service is great! Very friendly and helpful staff. And they have happy hour 3-6. I wish I could do regular cheese, because I would for sure come in for their one slice with a salad lunch option......oh well, at least Picazzos gives me a pretty good version of what I used to enjoy! Thanks Picazzos!"}
