{"text":"This is a real genuine Jewish deli in Toronto (Moe Pancers is another good one). No flash and dash..the menu looks delightfully archaic. Unlike other delis that's are almost parodies of what a deli should be, this place delivers the goods....the food is the focus. It's a time warp and most people who care about food wont give a damn about the lack of chrome and neon. The corned beef was piled high and very very good. It's in a random spot behind Pearson...so you'll need a car to drive here. Glad I found this after the first deli debacle on this past trip to the 416."}
{"text":"Average mom and style eatery.  Typical Canadian fare (bland)."}
{"text":"So I ordered the smoked meat with fries and gravy and it wasn't bad but not great.   When the bill for this lunch came to $18 plus tip it definitely pushed the value down.  I wanted to find a new 'great' smoked meat place for the money and this isn't it.  If superb smoked meat and fries is really the goal I would recommend Peter's on Eglintons.    Still better then anything downtown and comparable to Smoke Meat Petes in Beaconsfield, Quebec."}
{"text":"Lonely for Montreal style deli with smoked meats and corned beef, look no further, there is a bit of traditional Montreal near the Toronto airport. You can get your meat sandwich fix at Switzer's. I've tried a few of the sandwiches here over the years, and I've not been disappointed yet! The fries are really good, the coleslaw it very nice. The ambiance is very much as you would expect at a meat deli. I love this place! A hidden gem. Worth the drive... It's busy so give yourself some time."}
{"text":"Sweaty man making the sandwiches should really wash his hands or use gloves. Was in search of a hidden gem but left grossed out and with corned beef on stale bread."}
{"text":"Deli sandwiches are the main reason you'd want to visit, but be warned, the portions are very small and the prices are way high (for the quantity given).  A nice dive-y place to visit every once in awhile if you're really jonzing for deli...."}
{"text":"WOW LOVE THIS PLACE ! My first day at TJX the team took me here for lunch and I thought - WOW where has this place been hiding......   Switzer's is close to my office and I've been here about 4 times. Smoked meat on toasted rye is fantastic !    Small place, maybe 15 tables, the staff are very friendly and attentive. They are always packed at lunchtime. Decor is stuck in a bit of a time warp, but it's a deli and doesn't pretend to be anything else.   Today the boss bought launch, which made it even sweeter !"}
{"text":"Oh Switzers how I love Switzers.  This place is by far amazing.  Its not much to look at and is in the middle of a busy industrial area but I have not been dissappointed yet.  I have had many many item on the menu.  Great Fries.  Great Dill.  Great Coleslaw.  Sandwiches tasty and awesome.  If you are into deli sandwiches this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Consistently good food.    I have been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years.  Pretty much am at the stage now where I do NOT have to order (they know).  Bring your appetite.  It's a massive sandwich.  Have a matzo ball soup, and, their fries are to die for.    Enjoy!  Thank-you Switzers!!"}
{"text":"I travel to the Toronto/Mississauga often for work and the company I work with up there is located two blocks away from the hidden neighborhood staple. They always talk about it.  The area is \"different\" as there are chain restaurants, strip clubs, trucks/forklift schools, steak houses, sporting good shops and MORE strip clubs. Needless to say the first time they took me here I was a little apprehensive.   Upon walking in I could INSTANTLY smell the delicious deli aroma I have come to be familiar with! The tables were old and a little sticky. The floor was dingy but the FOOD is always PERFECT. They have typical deli meats and some local favorites as well. I have learned to LOVE the smoked meat there (Only trumped by Manhattan/Brooklyn delis) I always tend to order the smoked meat sandwich on rye with the spicy mustard and fries. I MUST tell you to order with the spicy mustard. It is out of this world DELICIOUS!!!! The food comes out SUPER fast and the waitresses are the sweetest ladies ever.  If you are ever in this neck of the wood, make sure to treat yourself to a cheap and delicious lunch. It is so revered that we now discuss the food (and how to smuggle us back some smoked meats) in our Canadian emails.  Its Cheap.  Its Quick.  Its Dirty.  Its Damn Tasty.  Go there."}
{"text":"They serve Lester's Montreal Smoked Meat which is acceptable.  Haven't tried their corned beef.  Pastrami seems supermarket-grade and nothing special.  The food isn't bad but the price is steep and portions tiny.  If you don't order 2 deli sandwiches there's no way you're getting sufficiently full, even for a lunch IMO.  Seemed friendly enough at the counter but I ended up spending more than I wanted to, and the portion of meat inside the deli sandwiches was definitely lacking.."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but, as some of the other reviews have pointed out, it is just a tad expensive.  Some of the pictures on here are a little misleading too. With no frame of reference the sandwiches look pretty big in the picture but in reality they're pretty small portions for a diner / sandwich shop. The plates they get served on (that you see in the pictures) are not dinner plates, they're appetizer plates. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pros: go there for the corned beef on rye with a side of your choice. That's my usual order for about a decade plus I've gone there. Nothing else is needed.   It's a small place, always packed. Which is a good thing, shows it does well. Service is good. It's a deli, doesn't pretend as it was mentioned earlier. Portions are a decent size. Tons of flavour.   Cons: slightly on the more expensive side, worth it but still. Can get really packed, where finding a seat is difficult at times. Other than that, it's a def must to check out when in this area."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and expected it to be OK but was pleasantly surprised. The smoked meat was excellent and so were the French fries. I went around 2pm and it was not busy. The service was good. The place itself is not at all fancy but exactly what you expect from a deli. Many people commented on the price but I have found that concerning delis, it's either good or cheap - not both. If you know what a good deli is, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most reviews.  This place is the closest to a real Jewish deli around.  Food is great and people are appropriately grumpy (yes, that's good).   However the price is just goofy."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars only because it was way overpriced. We got 2 smoked meat sandwiches, 2 cans of coke and a side of fries and coleslaw on one of the sandwiches to share. It came to $31. $5.55 extra for a medium size portion of fries and a 1/4 cup of coleslaw? Sandwiches were $9 and pops were $2.25. Everything was absolutely delicious, so I feel bad for writing a review based on the price.. I was just somewhat upset that they are charging $5 for a standard serving of fries and some coleslaw. I would recommend this place because the food was good.. Just a be prepared for the steep pricing."}
{"text":"Retro, worn and delicious.  Obviously a popular working mans spot with great selection of deli sandwiches. Prices are a bit high at $8.50 for a sandwich, but it was well done and Im likley being a bit cheap as I know business and food costs are raising prices everywhere.  Service was stunningly fast and I had my sandwich in less than 2 minutes.   Ordered apple strudel for dessert and it appeared home made, but was way below average and I had to send it back after one bite, so...great for sandwiches and not desserts.  Considering this area is an industrial wasteland this is a bit of a Gem in this area and much better than getting McD's etc.."}
{"text":"It is not Schwartz's but what place is? Almost thirteen dollars for a small sandwich and a pop it should be better or bigger and definitely less salty. Not worth a long drive but if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Reading the comments and reviews I expected the Montreal smoked meat to taste better than it did. But it just tasted like basic deli meat on bread. Really good quality deli meat; but it did not really taste as good as the smoked meat I had had in Montreal"}
