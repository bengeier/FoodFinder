{"text":"Great sandwiches.
Friendly staff.
It's a hidden gem in Uptown Yonge!"}
{"text":"A cute, local, and fresh little sandwich shop. I love to stop by for their fresh made salads, sandwiches, and pot pies. They can run out of the sandwiches around the lunch hour due to their popularity but usually have various pot pies (steak & mushroom, steak & cheese, chicken, curry, etc) and salads that are tasty too. My favourite salad is the caprese salad but their pasta salads and kale salads are nice as well."}
{"text":"Cute shop, friendly staff and great selection of cheese.

Triple cream Brie and the drunken goat cheese were yummy.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter was very friendly and knowledgeable. She gave some excellent recommendations on some fantastic cheese based on my dinner plans. I only wish I took note of the cheeses before I scarfed them down. Overall price point is about the same as the nearest grocery store so as a local unless I'm in a real hurry I'll always make the effort to drop by to get my cheese."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the afternoon for a late lunch. Unfortunately, they were out of sandwich bits, but they have a great array of cheeses, crackers, and accompaniments, which I picked up instead. 

They also carry pies from Wisey's, which have a unique crust - both chewy and flaky. 

The owner was present and an amazing host - she was quick to offer suggestions on cheeses and meats, and promised some excellent sandwiches on my next visit. 

I live nearby and will update once I try them!

All in all the shop had an aura of careful curation and a love for good ingredients. Here's hoping their sandwiches have the same feel!"}
{"text":"Went back today for more.

This is quality - clearly a lot of thought has gone into the purchasing of the products.  All fine, refined cheese.  Something I had not seen before today - and may give it a try soon:  Cheddar Cheese with Guinness!"}
{"text":"Small local cheese shop, don't have too many selection but you won't be disappointed with what they have. Cheese, anchovies, meat, etc. The staff was very friendly and gave me great recommendations with some samples. Will certainly be going good back."}
{"text":"Stopped by today to pick up some cheese to go with our wine. The shop is very cute and has a wonderful selection of cheeses, crackers, condiments, etc. The experts there are so friendly and helpful. Felt nothing but love! Next time I'll pick up the fresh baguette & pat√© along with my cheeses! See you again super cute cheese shop"}
