{"text":"Great local, family owned sandwich shop. Food is good, and prices are very reasonable. Also, they have a great vegetarian sub, which is uncommon for sandwich shops. Definitely a 4th Ward must try."}
{"text":"Was hungry and wanted something to fill me up and not cost too much. The reviews I read indicated this would be a good place to go. I live really close by so I walked in, didn't have to wait very long to order, staff was friendly. Ordered the #1 - jersey sub. Paid and waited a reasonable amount of time. Got my sub and walked home. I was very impressed, the flavor was great, it was perfect I enjoyed every bite. The reviews were accurate, amazing value, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best vegetarian sub in Charlotte, the people that run this place are really nice and involved in the community.   I always get the vegetarian on wheat with swiss, pickles, mustard, O&V, lettuce and onions, a side kosher pickle and a sweet tea    for no more than $8.    They're closed on Saturdays but packed when they're open. LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Best subs in Charlotte! No frill local joint with great prices. Same people all the time and they work hard. It may take some time if you go right at noon. Call ahead if you are in a hurry. If you pay cash it saves you 50 cents. I love the New Jersey sub with extra sauce. A little on the spicy side so beware."}
{"text":"Don't let the location in a rundownish, older strip mall fool you.  I live in the neighborhood and had seen this place a few times, before I decided to wander in.  I always get the Italian - what can I say? I'm a creature of habit - and it is delicious.  Seem to be a lot of regulars in here especially during the busy lunch hours  Friendly service, good prices, great Italian sub.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Great place. You can't beat the price and the subs are way better than subway which is right down the street. $5 for sub, chips and drink at sub one."}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place! Delicious, fresh subs made to order! Wayyyy better than subway! Workers are nice too! No matter how many people are in there, there is never a long wait."}
{"text":"Great food and better prices. The staff is always really nice. They charge extra to use a card and their service can be slow, but the good deal you're getting makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich. Good roll, great toppings with a fantastic price. Salads are huge and fresh. Quick service too.  Don't pass up."}
{"text":"A case of you get what you pay for. Cheap prices come with cheap quality food. Only thing good about the sand which was the bread."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices. Very fresh ingredients and the bread was so soft. Guys were really nice too. They charge an additional $.50 to run your debit/credit card."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the price.  Sandwich was average - had the #1 Jersey.  If I could change a few things about it I would change the roll and I would increase the amount of steak (I would be willing to pay an additional dollar to have the sandwich overflowing with steak).  One person working register and cooking so don't come if you're in a hurry unless u pre-order by phone.  The inside has fast food type booths."}
{"text":"Been going here for years! Never had a bad sandwich. Always consistent and friendly. I recommend the New Jersey steak and cheese add light mayo."}
{"text":"I love this place! I make sure to stop by and order several subs whenever I'm in town. The subs taste amazing, the people are great, and the place is always clean. It's a family owned and operated business so the atmosphere is very personal but it still feels professional.   My only tip is order ahead if you're in a rush because everything is made to order and perfection takes time."}
{"text":"Funny, but Richard, the owner went to college with a friend of mine at UNCC. This was my first time eating here, had the NY sub and it was fabulous! Prices are great, this is a great place to grab some subs - good selection and good prices. Chatted with Richard about UNCC's glory days in the NIT and the NCAA tournaments when my friend, Jeff played for the 49ers."}
{"text":"My first & last visit. Nothing at all amazing about the sandwich...not even the bread. All the veggies I wanted for my sandwich the guy had to keep gooding back & opening up the refrigerator to get all my toppings. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Tried the veggie sub one day for the first time after a coworker picked up food. I quickly asked her for the name and I try to eat here every time i come to charlotte. Very affordable and its the best vegetarian sub I've had thus far."}
{"text":"Been here many times for lunch as I work really close by. Every time I am there, they always greet me by name and even remember my usual order. The food is always top shelf and well prepared. All food is made to order, which ensures me that I get my food steaming hot just the way I like it. I would pay more if they offered footlong subs, which sadly they don't. It would also be plus if they sold french fries. Overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"Subs are about 8 inches and typically under $5 Try the New Jersey Sub"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in town.  I have had a lot of there subs and never had a bad experience.  Everything taste fresh and great.  The vegetarian or the lamb gyro are the best subs.  The vegetarian is so good it makes you question if you are eating meat.    I will keep going back and the staff there is great."}
{"text":"Wow! So glad I found this place. Walking to subway on graham st and luckily caught this place on my way. Sandwiches where very good, fresh ingredients, bread was good, and very good portions (8\" if not 9\" subs). My girlfriend and I got 2 sandwiches (Italian&Turkey) both where delicious, our bill was less than 10$ for 2 subs and a bag of chips. Overall the sandwiches are excellent, better than any chain franchise, and the best part all subs are less than 5$"}
{"text":"Disgusting,  slow and pathetic.  Takes phone orders before the people standing in front of them.  Food is subpar.  Skip unless starving"}
{"text":"It's a hidden treasure really--huge, delicious sub for under $6 in a random shopping strip a couple blocks from my work. I always get the same thing: Hot Italian sub"}
{"text":"Try this place out for the first time today with my boyfriend. He got the steak (#1) and I got the veggie (#21).  So, the veggie was awesome. It came with veggies and some soy-based mock meats (which are VEGAN!). Just ask for no cheese or mayo. The cook even put on some extra veggies for me (mushrooms and olives) after we had already paid. Super sweet and friendly guy.   I recommend and will be back.   Keywords: vegan sandwich, vegan, vegan hoagie, vegetarian"}
{"text":"Really good subs and very inexpensive. Love the cheesesteaks. Almost felt bad for the one employee slinging subs and taking orders for the entire shop. They could easily raise prices by a dollar a two to hire an extra hand to help out.  Overall, great subs, inexpensive and friendly service. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I have a pretty late appointment at the nail salon next door, so I decided to come in here to kill some time. I'm so glad I did!!! I've lived on this side of town for 2 years and I've NEVER been here.  I test a sandwich shop by their tuna sandwiches because that's my favorite lol. It was amazing!! The bread and the other ingredients are really fresh, and it was the perfect amount of flavor and mayo.  Please support your black owned businesses and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Best sub shop in town!  The bread and pizza sauce they use are the best!!!  Highly recommend the Supreme or Chicken Parm."}
{"text":"Sub One is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. I used to work near there, and I went to Sub One almost every day. They have a unique vegetarian sandwich with fake meat that they heat up. It's got peppers and onions and melty, yummy cheese and sauce and all kinds of good stuff.  The guys are really friendly, and they learned my name after a few visits. I never had to order...they just started cooking. It's a small, family-owned business, and they seem to be doing well...especially to be in such a hidden location off the beaten path. The sandwiches are spectacular, though, so I\"m not surprised that they're doing well."}
{"text":"Affordable and Absolutely delicious food. They have been around for 26 years for a reason. Great food!"}
{"text":"Good service. It gets a little busy around lunch time so it is better if you call ahead of time.   Make sure you have cash if you don't want to be charged a small fee for using a card.   It would be great if these guys sign up on UberEats or GrubHub so its easier to order online."}
{"text":"Some of the best subs in the QC. The bread is out of this world. Fluffy, soft, heavenly goodness. It's a family owned joint so you can expect great customer service! They're closed Saturdays which is a bummer, but open every other day of the week.   It's one of those awesome hole in the wall gems that you want to keep a secret, but also want to tell the world about!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for one sub and it ended up being pretty bad. There was almost no meat on it and the bread was a little stale."}
{"text":"This place had everything a sammich lover needed. A straightforward, simple menu, friendly people, and a little reading material for when you go stag.   It looks like from the other reviews, that I am not the only one who gravitates towards the Italian wherever I go. Here was no exception and it was really good, convenient, and reasonable. I got just the sub and it was $4.15.   I'm not going to say I don't like elaborate, descriptor-laden sandwiches, but sometimes you just need your classic build and that's exactly what you find at Sub One."}
{"text":"The filling in the hoagie was decent.  The bread could have been a lot better.  The guys that run the place are one of a kind, polite, and quick.   For me, the most important part of the hoagie is the bread.  It just didn't do it for me this time.  I will continue my search for that perfect hoagie in Charlotte.  Anyway, create your own opinion about this place.  This place is always busy during lunchtime and some of the guys that walked through the door knew the guys behind the counter.  It definitely has a neighborhood feel to it.  I would grab another bite to eat from there out of convenience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to give this place one star for the fact I was unable to try the food due to the lack of service.   When entering this establishment with my girlfriend, we thought based on reviews alone; we could grab a quick Sunday sub/sandwich. As we entered, we did not receive any acknowledgment for about ten minutes. He then spoke without looking at us, \"be with you in in a few minutes\" (if I can recall). So we waited a bit longer, there were two other people in the place, and none of them had their sandwiches yet, he was still getting his stuff together and the only employee there. I have no idea why he was slower than molasses, but it's a shame a small local place like this won't be able to stay in business for much longer.   We left after twenty plus minutes because we haven't even given him our order yet, and I was starving. There luckily was a Subway up the street."}
{"text":"Great local spot with the best gyro I've had outside of the Northeast. I really wanted to try the Jersey but they couldn't explain why it got its named, considering it didn't resemble anything I've ever eaten back home. Maybe if I'm in the area again I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"I love sub one hoagie house!  John and the guys are always pleasant, the food is always made fresh to order and the prices are very reasonable. I always order the jersey cheese steak with oil and vinegar, lettuce, tomato, mayo and steak sauce and it is awesome. I've been coming to sub one for over 10 years!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Veggie sub is the best I've ever had!! And we love the chicken philly. Something about that sauce that's so delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I got the New Jersey Steak (make sure you get the steak sauce with it). The people working there are so nice too, they were extremely friendly and made recommendations too. A large drink is $1.50, and it is 2 pepsi cans, so more than enough soda.  Extremely inexpensive for what you get, delicious, and local, you gotta try this place today. I'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Great place! Food is excellent. I've never told an owner they should charge more for their food but I did today. I got footling Italian, big kosher dill, chips, and Pepsi for only $7.25. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I love the italian.  The chicken parm is also great, just the right balance of chicken, sauce and cheese.  Can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"One of the best hoagies I've had in a long time. Prices are great! Employees are very friendly too... Definantly worth trying out"}
{"text":"What a great find. I'm a big fan of supporting small, local businesses, and this one is worth it. They have great sandwich selections, they taste great, and the staff clearly work hard. I've seen some other comments about the bread--I love bread, but the filling is more important. I had the Supreme sub, with steak, mushrooms, cheese, and sauce, and it was so flavorful. Best of all, you can get a great sub for an extremely reasonable price.   The building itself is nothing fancy--but that's not a complaint. It's very simple, what some might call a \"hole-in-the-wall\" but it is so comfortably non-assuming and salt-of-the-earth. Parking is easy. We were so happy with our experience there at lunch and I am sure we will go back."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sub spots in Charlotte!  It's always clean, the people are always friendly, the prices are not inflated, and the subs are always good... I always get  the vegetarian sub ... And I'm not even vegetarian!  lol"}
{"text":"Food is good, the people who work there are great, it's just really, REALLY slow. I like it, just really have to make the time to wait for it."}
{"text":"Some may pass Sub One by given the location and to that I say, no... it's not Ballantyne, South Park or Birkdale but good food knows no geographic or high dollar part of town limitations so pass by at your own risk.  That risk... Not getting a delicious sandwich served by friendly folks in an atmosphere that is laid back, casual and comfortable.    My favorite is the New Jersey Steak but everything I've seen being consumed by the dine-in crowd looks good and everyone looks happy eating it.  Their takeout business seems to be hopping during lunch hours so, another good sign.  Give em a try!"}
