{"text":"Horribly staffed, overcooked crepes with questionable filling (not fresh) - whip topping, not whip cream and lots of lard/fat added to crepe batter."}
{"text":"First of all, why is there an option to tip on the debit/credit machine anyway? You're in a food court! ..and at the point you're expected to pay, all they've done is take your order. 

Regardless, I wouldn't have tipped these 2. After making my payment, the one Asian girl says something to the other and preparation of my crepe begins..there was a very thin layer of chocolate spread on and it was a struggle for her to cover half. The banana peeled and picked at and then literally thrown onto the crepe, toasted coconut sprinkled on and crepe wrapped together very sloppily. Nothing close to the sample picture. It wasn't chopped up and placed..I had 2 halves thrown down! Not impressed! 

Customer service was non existent. I will not be back and I love crepes...this experience just left a really bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I LOVE that Crepe Works has now graced the presence of Market Mall. A healthy option is EXACTLY what the food court needed. 

Dessert crepes, savory crepes and simple crepes OH MY! Crepe Works has got everything crepes and the only thing you need to worry about is how to please your taste buds best! 

Whether you're craving a cold salad crepe or a warm, ooey gooey one, Crepe Works is sure to please."}
{"text":"To bad the owner is so cheap!!! 
Their chocolate lair is so thin u can barley feel it,  whatever request u have is extra charge so a crape could easily cost 9$ and more...  
The employs are awesome and fruits are fresh but I guess they have very restricted orders around quantitys which preaty much ruins the experience."}
{"text":"While I love to get a strawberry delight and take it home a few times a month what happened to me recently leaves me no choice but to give them one star. Lets keep in mind it's a cheap crepe and not a French crepe. Having that in mind they are not bad and tasty when made properly.

I am a fan of the food at crepe works and I buy a strawberry delight a few times a month as a treat for myself. I have a kidney illness which prevents me from working and keeps my diet pretty restricted. The crepe is a good treat because its still reasonably healthy. I often drive just to get a crepe.

I went to the market mall crepe works in Calgary one night for a crepe. There were two people in front of me. A young woman was working alone that night. I watched her take the other two people's orders and make their crepes from a pile of already made crepes on the counter and not prepare them fresh as they are supposed to. She took my order and I asked for a fresh crepe made to order. She ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made Crepes and I could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use. My crepe was soggy and a little gross. I watched her from the moment I stood in line till I left and she did not make one crepe for the three of us.

The next day I was at the mall to deposit a cheque so I went to the crepe works to let them know what happened the night before and get another one to take home. When I started to tell the guy what happened he cut me off and said I was wrong. He told me it was impossible and I did not see that. So I tell him that I know what I saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine. Again he tells me no I'm wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible. I told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that I was there and he was not so I would know what happened. I tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other. It's not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself.

  For the next twenty mins he tells me that I have no idea what I am talking about, that its impossible to happen and that I'm wrong. He also has the audacity to say I'm just in a bad mood so I'm saying these things because of that. First of all this guy knows nothing about me and I was in a great mood before when I started to tell him about it I just wanted them to make sure it doesn't happen again. Now every time I come to get a crepe he asks me if I'm in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable. Plus when I told him that his customer service was horrible and NO ONE talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way. He gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after I left a message explaining the whole thing I never heard back. That was over two weeks ago now. 

I do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are NEVER made the way the example looks. It bothers me that every time I go buy one he asks me if I'm in a bad mood and makes fun of me. Unfortunately this is the only crepe works in Calgary and I still like the strawberry delight. I am owed an apology and who knows if that girl is still cutting corners when she works. 

Don't expect any kind of respect or good customer service if you have a complaint."}
{"text":"HOLY CREPE!  I never knew all the glories that a crepe held until I ate from here!  I wish I could only ever eat crepes for the rest of my life.

Crepe Works has such an interesting menu, all circulating around different crepes and ingredients.  They have everything from breakfast crepes, to lunch crepes to dessert crepes.  Take your pick at which one you would like best.

I'd only ever had breakfast crepes with fruit and whipped cream, so I was intrigued by the lunchtime crepes this place offered.  They have a bunch of different chicken crepes, a veggie one and some yummy ham ones.  I wasn't feeling too outrageous, so I just got the ham and cheese.  It was warm and gooey and so delicious!  It was a different spin on a regular sandwich... and I loved it!

Lunch food aside, they also have so many sweet fruit ones to choose from.  There's a bunch of banana combinations, blueberry, orange, chocolate, etc., etc.  I'm 100% positive that you'll be able to find something you like.

I truly enjoyed my meal at this place and will probably try a different crepe next time I'm shopping and feel the hunger pains!  Mmm crepes!"}
