{"text":"I take my kids here for a special dinner about once a month. (For some inexplicable reason my wife doesn't like Indian food.) My daughter has her favorites, but my son and I enjoy experimenting with foods we've never tried before.

The servings are generous, the ingredients fresh, the owner is friendly and, overall, the dining experience is quite simply among the most enjoyable one can have.

The restaurant is tiny. If it's a Friday or Saturday, you'll need a reservation. But -- and I can't stress this enough -- this place is probably the best Indian restaurant in southern Ontario.

Best of all, the prices are reasonable, too.

I'm lucky to live just a block away from here, but I'd gladly travel for a while to enjoy food of this quality."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is fantastic, food is amazing, variety is spot on and the prices are great! I love eating here and the staff are so lovely. I can't stress enough how great this place is! If I could give more stars I would"}
{"text":"Wow. I was so underwhelmed by this restaurant I can't even explain. Having had a coworker express her love of this restaurant over one of MY favorite indian places, I had to give it a shot.

And so I drove out of my way to have what I was hoping would be a delicious indian treat. I very quickly realized otherwise. The service: bad. The atmosphere: bad. (they basically tried to kick us out after our first round....have i mentioned my fiancee eats a lot?) The food: not good (not inedible). I don't need my food served to me on a cafeteria tray, I had enough of that in elementary school.

The naan was basically like.....flatbread. Not very authentic. The food was bordering on tasteless at times, which is weird considering the nature of indian cuisine. Overall, I really really wanted to enjoy this place....but I couldn't. But hey, the prices were pretty good."}
{"text":"after seeing all the good reviews i decided to go.
the place stunk
the food taste nasty
i new it was going to be bad just by the vibe i had when i got in the shop
we were the only customers .
and they watched us eat our food,i _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hate that."}
{"text":"Me and my six year old sister decided to walk here (45 minutes) and use her birthday money for a delicious treat. Me being a female of Indian descent, I was very, very excited to try the food after reading the reviews on yelp. As soon as I walked in, the place was completely packed and it was burning, no a/c. I ordered two chicken buriyanis, one mild and the other spicy, and one mango lassi. I thought the chicken buriyani was $9.95 so I was like meh, yolo. It ended up being $10.95. They gave my sister a glass of water because she asked for it and an elderly lady gave her a bag of gummies. The service was great, thus the second star, but I am the definition of disappointment right now. I had to wait a good hour for the two buriyanis. The mango lassi came within ten minutes, (thank god) but it was $2.25 for a small cup. I come home excitedly to try my food and I started crying. Yes, crying. The food looked so disgusting and inedible, I felt like I let my sister down. The total was $25.27 because of the 10% cash discount, if not, it would have been $28.07. The food did not even cover half the takeout box and it was just yellow coloured rice with mushy curry. The spicy buriyani was not even spicy and the mild tastes disgusting. I am writing this review right after eating that food and I am already sick to my stomach. Please do not purchase the buriyanis if you go here. I have ate $4 buriyanis with the box overfilled and great taste. I wanted to like this place so bad, but I can't. I will not return here again."}
{"text":"I love this place and continue to eat here whenever I want some comfort food! The service is always wonderful, and pleasant. The food is perfectly seasoned and prepared. 1 thing to note, spicy is SPICY. My husband and I ordered spicy, and usually we're used to \"westernized\" spicy food so we tend to order extra spicy when possibly. Their spicy..was HOT...still great but we since have learned to go a bit milder because we order food for two days and when you re heat it it becomes even more spicy :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have had Indian & Pakistani food before. I came here and actually ordered for the first time for my family and my friends. Had buriani and other curries and the traditional Nan bread. The place was really small and I did have a hard time finding it. I went here after I heard good things from people around the area about the food. When I got there the place was packed, but I saw it was not hard for it to be packed as it is a very small intimate place. Because I had so much food I actually went to the back to the restaurant to the kitchen to pick my order.

As for the food I have to say the buriani was really mushy and slimy. It did not taste very good. In my experience the rice should not be that mushy. The curries on the other hand were very good. The bread well it was ok. Overall I was disappointed after hearing so much good things about this place. I may give it another try because they could have been having a bad day!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family the other day. There were 6 of us. Service was rather slow and they didn't tell me that the food I ordered doesn't come with rice or naan. Most indian restaurants serve their food with one or the other, and if for some reason they don't then they at least tell you that that. Make sure you make a reservation if you want to go here this place can get full fast, not a lot of seating available and not good for large groups.

So please order rice or naan with your food order otherwise you'll have to wait another 5 mins while your food continues to get cold.

Flavour was lacking, I expect a lot of flavour when it comes to Indian food, because that is what indian food is about but this place was lacking in that department.

They had a lot of variety, lots of vegetarian and vegan options. The coconut tomato soup was great. Their biryani comes with this onion coleslaw that was very flavourful.

Parking is in the back and tricky to find and has limited spots.

I don't think that I am going to go here again."}
{"text":"I went for Indian takeout since I was vegetarian that day. Food was really good except only thing I found was that it was really overpriced compared to the Indian restaurants I've been to. This would make me not come here again especially when I ordered garlic naan and got the wrong type of naan. As well, serving size wasn't enough when ordering naan. If you go here order more than two pieces since each one is cut ridiculously small."}
{"text":"I've only been here during weekday lunch hour for their buffet.  It is one of the best value lunches around.  $10 per person, taxes in.

The selection is somewhat limited, but I found the quality of what they have to be very good.  And because the selection is limited, what is there moves quickly and everything stays fresh.

Butter chicken is on the sweet side--if that is your thing.  It isn't my thing, but I still go back for seconds.  Goat curry, is also quite tasty, and I'm not really a goat eater either.   

Samosas are good as well, but the nann is kind of weird.. tasty, but totally different than most other restaurants.

It is family operated and the service is always outstanding.  It looks like it used to be a small house, so seating is limited, and it fills up rather quickly during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Having dined at almost every Indian restaurant in the Toronto area, this one is definitively the best. How Mr. Singh makes his Saag is a mystery but I can't stop eating it.. Plate after plate after plate... I drive all the way from midtown Toronto just to eat here. Its that good."}
{"text":"Amazing food have been going there forever and they never disappoint. The owners are extremely nice and friendly the food always taste fresh and wonderful. And the service is amazing highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"I usually came here for the buffet which is OKAY. But i wanted to try al carte.

I read their review on the back of the menu, and the suggestion of Chef's Biryani and I'm glad I tried it.

I ordered mild, because in my experience 'mild' in a south asian restaurant is a bit spicy.

This dish however was not spicy, but the best part was it was still flavourful and heavenly delicious.

If I could find an opposite for bland, this is the dish.

I plan to try their butter chicken next time.

The owner/family is very charming, which is a bonus."}
{"text":"OMG sooo delicious and very reasonable prices.
The owner is very friendly and waitress are very pleasant.
Try it, you won't be disappointed.
We asked if there's a time limit during lunch buffet?
The owner is so kind, he said no rush I want people to enjoy eating. 
I will definitely return and recommend others"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place to try it out. My usual go to place is the other Indian restaurant nearby.

To be honest, the food was good. The butter chicken was on the sweeter tomato-ie side, the naan was soft and fresh, the rice was cooked really well, the samosa's were huge, the aloo gobi was good and the onion Bahji was decent. We obviously ordered too much food for two people. 

The service was good and the server always took the time to check in on us and made sure we had more water. 

The only downside was the fact that the prices on the menu aren't what they charge you at the end of your meal. I didn't bring it up to the server because I understand that prices have to go up at some point to keep a restaurant going with inflation and the cost to purchase food. I just thought it would be better business practice to at least update your menu so that customers aren't left in the dark by the pricing. 

Most of the items are anywhere from a dollar to two dollar in pricing difference. While it isn't a lot of money, but it somehow feels like we were cheated. 

The parking is also another downside because it is at the back of the restaurant and there are only a few spots. The pot holes are massive in the back parking lot so be careful. 

I don't know if I would come back. The menu mishap kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Which is unfortunate because the food was good."}
{"text":"Butter chicken with rice and naan... DELICIOUS! Honestly my new favorite dish. Great value too, I can get two meals out of it. 

The place is small so I always get takeout. Staff are always super friendly."}
{"text":"Our all time favorite Indian spot. A tiny little hole in the wall that I hope never changes (except for maybe getting more seating). 
My Dad swears their butter chicken is addictive and everything I've ever had from here is glorious. I'm pretty sure Mount Everest is family run and I don't know how the cooks aren't all a million pounds... if I could cook like that I would be."}
{"text":"It's pretty well known among my friends that I don't like eating Indian food. Mostly because I find a lot of places, who tend to Americanize their foods, or over charge for really cheaply made dishes to be lacking. However, I do often go out to try them, if jus to give them a try.

I went here with my mom, and we had their buffet.

The service was actually very good, they were very attentive and brought bread and water quickly. The owners seemed a bit overtly interested in talking with some guy on one side of the restaurant, but the rest of their staff was pretty good.

The atmosphere was interesting, it is picking and the place was a little small. However, it seemed like they really made an effort with the decorations, and the way everything was setup. The tables were a little awkward, and when you had the buffet you tended to be looming right over someones head.

The food was a mixed bag though. There were not very many options on the buffet, the options they did have were mostly meat. Also in their dishes with sauce it's like nobody really checked to see if anything was there. Looking for paneer in the Paneer Makhani was like hunting for treasure, the goat had little goat in it. The aloo gobi was absolutely appalling, it wasn't really cooked and wasn't flavoured at all. The yogurt had what tasted like sugar in it, the tandoori chicken was good, but when it ran out nobody replaced it. The naan were good, I liked how they were the right texture and everything. The dhaal was flavourless, and I'm not sure it was cooked quite right. The gulab jamun was fine.

I will give them bonus points for having really good beer, i definitely like the fact that a small restaurant has Hop City Beer, that's a great brewery. So bonus point for that. Overall most things were good, but the buffet overall was definitely a fail. I do appreciate their service, and their beer, but I wasn't really happy with their food."}
{"text":"Amazing! Always tastes fresh and delicious! Great and friendly service and the owner and chef always takes the time to talk to all of the customers and often tells a cute little story! Slower service on the weekends but, you won't care once you taste your food, quality is worth the wait! I can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"I had my food delivered to my place from this restaurant. I had ordered Kadhai Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala, Dal Makhani, Kutchumber Salad and Tandoori Roti. By the time the food came, the roti had become really chewy and tested bad. The chicken and the kadhai paneer had similar taste which was shocking considering the different gravy bases for both. 
The order saved face because of the dal makhani which was the only thing in the order that stopped me from putting the food in the trash. 
I had ordered from this restaurant because of the rating on Yelp. I understand the degree of hotness should not be judged for a delivery but that is no excuse for messing up the taste of the food. 

I will update this review once I return to Canada and visit this restaurant in person."}
{"text":"A really small place run by a charming family. If you have patience on the busy nights you'll be rewarded with delicious Indian cuisine. Food is full of flavour and so much better than any of the other places in Durham.  It could take some time to get your meal as they cook fresh and have a busy take-out business, too.

Don't miss the naan - it's fresh, served piping hot and bubbled. There's a great tandoori dinner for two you can only order in. We call it the meat festival, teasingly. There are always leftovers we take home. We love the Chicken Tikka, Rogan Josh, Biryani rice and the delicious Nauratan Vegetable Mix.  

Recommend reservations even on weeknights as they sometimes fill up unexpectedly.  Parking is in the back and can be accessed easily from Church St."}
{"text":"Sometimes, it doesn't take the best food or wildest decor to get a five star. It's a combination of great, passionate food and warm hospitality. 

The place looks small from the outside and I barely notice it driving by. But you know a place is going to be good when the owner himself greets you with a welcoming smile and each of the buffet options are cooked in small batches with heart and pride. 

The owner checked up on us a few times during our visit just to ask if everything was good. He had such a friendly smile and even though we didn't converse much, he made us feel welcomed and I could sense how passionate he is about his food. Thank you for bringing a bit of your culture to us!

The butter chicken is amazing!! Tender chicken with a delicious tomatoe-y yogurt-y sauce. I couldn't get enough of the fresh naan dipped in there. The goat curry was also very good! The lamb curry had bones with the bone marrow still inside all gelatinous and bursting with flavour! 

Honestly, I get random hankerings for some good Indian food, but never can find a place at a good price with a variety of dishes to enjoy. So glad my fellow Yelpers recommended this place. I'll be back for more!!

~Never judge a book by it's cover~"}
{"text":"Great choice for vegetarians! You could tell the bread was freshly made and not just heated up. The curries were delicious and had a great spice and flavour to them. The owner is very friendly and always checks up on the customers, which is nice to see. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Mr.Singh sold the place one month ago. You can tell with the taste of the food. The usual was ordered. The curry shrimp was not as tasteful, void of the coriander flavour and smaller shrimp. The butter chicken was less flavourful less cinnamon and tomato sweet flavour. The Mount Everest biryani was less tasteful and has less saffron taste. The man bread was good. That was one of my favourite restaurants ever, Mr.Singh was a great chef with a fantastic family. It disappoints me that I will have to give it one more try then possibly look elsewhere. I thought that would never happen. Mr.Singh made  the greatest Indian food I ever had the pleasure of tasting.  Best wishes to him and his entire family. The food is not the same. Lacks spice and flavour."}
{"text":"Mount Everest is a small family run restaurant in the town of Ajax :) The food has a home cooked feel to it. Not too heavy and very tasty without being over the top. If you like spicy - just ask :) I normally stick to Medium myself. If you order flaming potatoes I'd recommend going with Mild unless you can handle the heat! :)

I'd definitely recommend ordering from the menu vs the buffet. The buffet is perfectly fine, but it's a buffet! :) and I prefer to order my favourites. Some of my favourites are the flaming potatoes, spinach paneer, pakoras,  haandi chicken, (they also do a sizzling chicken plate that I've never personally tried but it looks, smells and sounds amazing!). Their Kulfi (Ice Cream) dessert is also very good! 

They're all about a friendly atmosphere, and great food. Manohar (the owner) often takes the time to speak to diners; asking them how the food was and he also has a lot of interesting stories to tell once you get to know him :)

There's parking at the back of the restaurant that you can access via Church St. In another review I can see someone's had difficulty finding it. I can see why that would be the case :) It's just one of those things about dining in Pickering Village. Narrower streets with little nooks here and there :)

Restaurant is often busy, even on a Tuesday night! (they are closed on Monday's)  so definitely worth reserving in advance."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  I ordered lunch size butter chicken for take out.  The butter chicken and rice were delicious.  Naan was also very good.  These three items were $17.00 - a little pricey but worth it.  Also, it was enough for two for sure or one if you're extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Had a lovely buffet lunch but not a very good ending. I came out to find my car that is parked on the direct west side of the restaurant is blocked off by the actual owner of the lot (mechanic lot) who said the owner of the restaurant was not willing to put signs on his restaurant informing his customers not to park there and that is was actually his garage property. Very difficult to tell if  you are new to the restaurant. Instead you're supposed to only park to the rear of the restaurant which can only be accessed by the next adjacent street. Shame on the owner of the restaurant to not put a clear sign directly above the parking spaces. There is a smaller sign off to the said that says \"park at rear\". Nobody knew would think to look there."}
{"text":"The Mount Everest is right on highway 2 right before Church street, its really easy to drive by so keep your eyes peeled for the turn to park (if you miss it, turn on Church and you can access the parking at the back). I ate here quite a while back but it was a memorable experience as I'd never had Indian Food before (and had never really been interested to. The person I was with was rather seasoned with different cuisines and had eaten at The Mount Everest many times, so they made a few recommendations and I got to try a few things I normally wouldn't have otherwise. 

We came in on a weeknight and it was rather busy - luckily my companion had made a reservation! This restaurant is terribly small so if you're planning on popping in, you may want to call ahead and make a reso just to make sure you can get seated right away. 

I'm the kind of person that likes to know what I want BEFORE I go somewhere, so I'd spent some time looking over the daunting menu and trying to figure out what I was game for. In the end, we ended up getting an appetizer platter, naan, Mattar Paneer, and some kind of Biriyani.

One of the standouts was the Assorted Indian Snacks platter that we had to share. Having never had indian food, it was a great way to start the meal, with samosas, pakora, chicken tikka, papadum, sheekh kebab and some sauces. Given, I couldn't tell you which thing was which (besides the samosas) for sure but it was all incredible! What I THINK was the Pakora was amazing, great flavor, lots of heat - I kept taking them off the plate before the other person could get at them. This platter was surprisingly large and I was almost full after having my half. 

The naan was incredible, just amazing - but you really have to eat it right away as it gets hard rather quickly. Fresh out of the oven naan was incredible, hot, buttery, soft and almost melt in your mouth. I would go back JUST for the naan because it was so damned good.

My Mattar Paneer was a bit of a letdown - I had been looking forward to trying Paneer for sooooo long. I love cheese and its been a staple in my house since I was a kid, and I've seen it made and it looked incredible, especially paired with peas (who DOESN'T like peas?!) but it really wasn't the dish for me. Flavor was a bit lacking and sadly, the paneer was disappointing, but I think that would have been true with any paneer dish - I had it quite built up in my head. The biriyani wasn't anything terribly memorable, but I only had a taste or two and its not something I would typically order myself anyways.

All in, this was a great local place to try out Indian food and I would go back again (but with someone who's adventurous into trying new foods). The menu is absolutely massive and it would take forever to try everything but I guarantee there's some serious gems hidden in the three pages of food. I'll be back (hopefully soon) to try it out again!"}
{"text":"Okay, everyone's entitled to an opinion.  The food, value, selection, and atmosphere are perfectly acceptable for this price range.  In fact, you'll more than likely be pleasantly surprised with your meal.  Just be sure to specify your level of spiciness and you will be accommodated. It's quite simply an intimate place to eat.  
NOTE: Mr Singh has sold his restaurant here, but not before he transferred his cooking skills to the new ownership. Still a very high standard and quality of food. As a customer, I appreciate that consistency. Kudos!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place to go. Food is incredible and very fairly priced. Great menu selection and lunch buffet is great to try if you are new to Indian food. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Also have a great bar selection with many authentic beers. Never a single complaint."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years and can't say enough good things about this place! The food is amazing and like how it's vegetarian friendly. The lassi's are great...and always a popular treat with the kids! Overall great atmosphere and the staff are super friendly. The place is always busy, so best to make reservations. Food reco: tarka dhal, chanamasala, butter chicken paneer."}
{"text":"Fair prices and great Indian food in a quaint little restaurant. So good!! It is that simple.

I believe Mr. Singh and his family own and operate the restaurant. They are such great people. So friendly. Every time I have eaten here I see Mr. Singh greet everyone who walks in the door in such a friendly way, almost like he is welcoming us into his home, and it really does feel like you are eating home cooked food in someones home rather than a restaurant.

On top of the great people, the food is also incredibly tasty and delicious. The selection in the buffet is not quite as big as some other buffets I have been too, but the food that is available is done right! I much prefer their philosophy of high quality over quantity when it comes to their food selections. There is about 6 to 8 types of curry/meat dishes, naan, rice, salad and sweet bread balls for dessert. All done deliciously.

The number one food item that stands out here is their Butter Chicken. I have had Butter Chicken in so many different restaurants, and hands down, the Butter Chicken in this restaurant is the best I have ever tasted in my life!!! It's not even close... if Mr. Singh's Butter Chicken finishes the race in 1st place, the 2nd place Butter Chicken is 10 miles behind. 

The Butter Chicken at Mount Everest has such an intricate flavor with a touch of sweetness that really makes it shine. I can't describe it well enough, you just have to go there and taste it for yourself. And the craziest part is, it is part of a buffet, which means you can enjoy as much of it as you want. 

Do yourself a favor and try their butter chicken fresh in their restaurant. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday for lunch and was surprised at how small it is.  The buffet only had two meat dishes (butter chicken, goat curry).  No tandoori chicken.  The gulab jamun was ice cold - tastes best when it's warm.

Having said the above, the food that I did try was tasty, although the goat curry was mainly bones.

I probably won't go back because Bombay Grill is right next door and has a better selection of food at the lunch buffet.  I'm not sure how Mount Everest survives with Bombay Grill in such close proximity."}
{"text":"Without question the best Indian food in the GTA.  Incredible value for exquisite, genuine  food.  For me, the saag paneer, tarka daal, and paneer korma are the stand outs.

The owners are wonderful people who treat their clients as family.   I can't recommend Mount Everest enough."}
{"text":"First time here in years.
The new owners are so pleasant. Food is seasoned properly. My mother is vegan and everyone made sure to accommodate her questions. If you have a chance give this place a try. 
The regular plate for two is absolutely huge so beware of ordering too many apps."}
